'''[[Adi Shankara]]''', a [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu philosopher]] of the [[Advaita Vedanta]] school, wrote a large body of works&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://sankaracharya.org/| title =  Works of Adi Shankara| accessdate =June 26, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060618033038/http://www.sankaracharya.org/| archivedate= 18 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are central to the Advaita Vedanta interpretation of the [[Prasthanatrayi]], the canonical texts consisting of the [[Upanishad]]s, the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Brahma Sutras]]. His works deal with logically establishing the doctrine of [[Advaita Vedanta]].

==Overview==

===Methodology===
Shankara formulates the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta by validating his arguments on the basis of quotations from the [[Vedas]] and other [[Hindu scriptures]].

A large portion of his works is [[polemic]]al in nature. He directs his polemics mostly against the [[Sankhya]], [[Buddhist philosophy|Bauddha]], [[Jainism|Jaina]], [[Vaisheshika]] and other non-vedantic [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu philosophies]].

===Authorship===
Many works thought to be of his authorship are debated and questioned as to their authorship today,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} including some of his best-known and important works, the {{IAST|[[Viveka Chudamani|Vivekacūḍāmaṇi]]}}{{sfn|Shah-Kazemi|2006|p=4}}{{sfn|Singh|2004|p=1315}} Maniratnamala, Para-puja and the {{IAST|[[Mandukya Upanishad|Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad]]}} {{IAST|Bhāṣya}}.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=262-265}} Other scholars {{sfn|Isayeva|1993|p=94}} say that Shankaracharya's authorship of the commentaries on the Brahman Sutra, the ten principal Upanishads as well as the Bhagavad Gita are beyond doubt.

==Classification==
Traditionally, his works are classified under
* {{IAST|[[Bhāṣya]]}}, ''commentary''
* {{IAST|Prakaraṇa grantha}}, ''philosophical treatise''
* [[Stotra]], ''devotional hymn''

The commentaries serve to provide a consistent interpretation of the scriptural texts from the perspective of Advaita Vedanta. The philosophical treatises provide various [[methodology|methodologies]] to the student to understand the doctrine. The devotional hymns are rich in poetry and piety, serving to highlight the helplessness of the [[bhakti|devotee]] and the glory of the [[deva (Hinduism)|deity]]. A partial list of his works is given below.

==={{IAST|Bhāṣya}}===

'''Adolescent sexuality in the United States''' relates to the [[human sexuality|sexuality]] of [[United States|American]] [[adolescence|adolescents]] and its place in American society, both in terms of their feelings, [[Adolescent sexual behavior|behaviors]] and development and in terms of the response of the [[Federal government of the United States|government]], educators and interested groups.

According to the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), in the year 2007, 35% of US high school students were currently sexually active and 47.8% of US high school students reported having had [[sexual intercourse]].&lt;ref name="YRBS"/&gt; This percentage has decreased slightly since 1991.&lt;ref name="SA"/&gt; According to a 1994 study, every year an estimated one in four sexually active teens contracts a [[sexually transmitted infection]] (STI).&lt;ref name="kaiser FS"/&gt; [[Teenage pregnancy]] is four times as prevalent in the United States as in the European Union.&lt;ref name="oecd"/&gt;  However, US teen pregnancy rates have been steadily declining for decades, according to the Centers for Disease Control and were at a "record low" as of 2012.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

In 1999, a [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] study found that 95% of public secondary schools offered [[sex education]] programs. More than half of the schools in the study followed a comprehensive approach that included information about both abstinence and contraception, while approximately one third of schools provided students with [[abstinence-only sex education]].&lt;ref name="Kaiser 2002"/&gt; In 2002, most Americans favored the [[Comprehensive sex education|comprehensive approach]].&lt;ref name="Kaiser 2002"/&gt; A 2000 study found that almost all schools included information about [[HIV]], the virus that causes AIDS, in their curricula.&lt;ref name="Kaiser 2002"/&gt; There have been efforts among social conservatives in the US government to limit [[sex education]] in public schools to [[abstinence-only sex education]] curricula.&lt;ref name="Kaiser 2002"/&gt; The effectiveness of abstinence-only programs has been an issue of controversy.&lt;ref name=Obs07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ott|first=MA|author2=Santelli, JS|title=Abstinence and abstinence-only education|journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=October 2007|volume=19|issue=5|pages=446–52|pmid=17885460|pmc=5913747|doi=10.1097/GCO.0b013e3282efdc0b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirby2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report|title=Emerging Answers 2007: Research Findings on Programs to Reduce Teen Pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Diseases|author=Kirby, D.|year=2007|publisher=National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy|access-date=June 30, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125612/http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report|archive-date=July 14, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual practices==
[[File:CDC_Teenager_Sex_Stats_2015.png|thumb|right|U.S. sexual practices in April 2015]]
Self-report surveys suggest that half of all 15- to 19-year-olds have had [[oral sex]]. That percentage rises to 70% by the time they turn 19, and equal numbers of boys and girls participate.&lt;ref name="wapo"/&gt; Research indicating that oral sex is less risky to teens' emotional and physical well being than vaginal sex has been advanced;&lt;ref name="mednews"/&gt; researchers at the University of California do not believe this conclusion is warranted.&lt;ref name="uc" /&gt; They found that oral sex, as well as vaginal sex, was associated with negative consequences.&lt;ref name="uc" /&gt; Of adolescents engaging in oral sex only, girls were twice as likely as boys to report feeling bad about themselves and nearly three times as likely to feel used.&lt;ref name="UCSF"/&gt; Despite their behaviors, 90% of adolescents "agree that most young people have sex before they are really ready."&lt;ref name="kaiser gender roles"/&gt;

The average age of first sexual intercourse in the United States is around 18 for males and around 17 for females,&lt;ref name="New Age"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kins Age"/&gt; and this has been rising in recent years.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt; For those teens who have had sex, 70% of girls and 56% of boys said that their first sexual experience was with a steady partner, while 16% of girls and 28% of boys report losing their virginity to someone they had just met or who was just a friend.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt;

Teens are using [[birth control]] (contraceptives) more today when they lose their virginity than they did in the past, and this is in part due to the [[AIDS epidemic]].&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt;  Of sexually experienced adolescents, 78% of girls and 85% of males used at least one contraceptive when they lost their virginity.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt; A detailed qualitative study of girls' loss of virginity found that their experiences "were almost all quite negative (and, in some cases, horrific)."&lt;ref name="review"/&gt; Before age 15, "a majority of first intercourse experiences among females are reported to be non-voluntary."&lt;ref name="Beginning"/&gt;

Adolescents who are better students generally initiate sexual activity later than those who are poor students. In addition, among those seventh and eighth graders, those with personal and perceived peer norms that encourage adolescents to refrain from sex are less likely to engage in it.&lt;ref name="MacLean"/&gt;

The percentage of teenagers who report they are currently sexually active has been dropping since 1991.&lt;ref name="sieving"/&gt; By 2005, the overall percentage of teenagers reporting that they were currently sexually active was down to 33.9%.&lt;ref name="YRBS"/&gt;  A lower number of sexually active teens are "quite positive in terms of their health and their well-being."&lt;ref name="AP birth rate"/&gt;

The [[condom]] is the most popular form of [[contraception]] used by teenagers.&lt;ref name="Pubmed stats" /&gt; Among sexually active 15- to 19-year-olds, from 2002 to 2010 more than 80% of females and more than 90% of males reported using at least one method of birth control during their last intercourse.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KFF_factsheet"/&gt; In 1995, only 71% of girls and 82% of boys reported using contraception the last time they had sex.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt; In 2006–2010, one in five sexually active female teens (20%) and one-third of sexually active male teens (34%) reported having used both the condom and a hormonal method the last time they had sex.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt;  Less than 20% of girls at risk for unintended pregnancy were not using any contraceptive method the last time they had sex.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt; Calendar abstinence, or the [[rhythm method]], was used by 17% of female teens in 2006-2008.&lt;ref name="Pubmed stats" /&gt;

===Sexual abstinence===
{{Main|Sexual abstinence|Chastity|Abstinence pledge}}

Sexual abstinence is the practice of refraining from some or all aspects of sexual activity for medical, psychological, legal, social, financial, philosophical, moral or religious reasons. For the last twenty years, abstinence rates among American adolescents have risen. The percentage of high school students in the US who reported that they have ever had sexual intercourse dropped from 54.1% in 1991 to 47.8% in 2007&lt;ref name="YRBS"/&gt; and to 43% in 2011.&lt;ref name="Minority"/&gt; A cross-sectional survey in 1998 found that fear of pregnancy was the most commonly cited reason for choosing abstinence, especially among girls, as well as boys who had caused a pregnancy in the past. Other reasons included a fear of sexually transmitted infections, a lack of desire, being afraid of getting caught, and the belief that sex was not appropriate for someone of their age.&lt;ref name="Tamkins"/&gt;

Epidemiologists at the Center for Disease Control emphasize that for sex education to be effective, it should take place before teens become sexually active.&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/health/chi-1230discoveriesdec30,1,979931.story |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109094207/http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/health/chi-1230discoveriesdec30,1,979931.story |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 9, 2008 |title=DISCOVERIES |accessdate=January 5, 2008 |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=December 30, 2007 |work=[[HealthDay]] News |first=Joe |last=Gray |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both adolescents who have never had sex and those who have chosen to become abstinent after engaging in sexual behaviors cite the negative consequences of sex as reasons why they choose not to have sex.&lt;ref name="Tamkins"/&gt;  Girls of all ages and experience levels were more likely than boys to cite the fear of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name="Tamkins"/&gt;  Virgin boys were more likely than girls to say they believed most students did not have sex.&lt;ref name="Tamkins"/&gt;
 
Boys who caused a pregnancy in the past were more than twice as likely to become abstinent after this episode than boys who had not. However, for girls, a past pregnancy had little correlation with secondary abstinence.&lt;ref name="Tamkins"/&gt; Fear of pregnancy, wanting to wait until marriage, and not wanting to have sex were cited more often by virgins in the 12th grade than they were by 9th graders.&lt;ref name="Tamkins"/&gt;  Of the sexually experienced who are now practicing abstinence, girls were more likely than boys to say a lack of desire, fear of STDs, being afraid of getting caught, the belief that sex was not appropriate for someone their age, and that their parents had taught them the advantages of waiting as reasons why they made their decision.&lt;ref name="Tamkins"/&gt;

===Definitions of virginity===
Among young people engaging in some form of sexual activity, definitions of [[virginity]] differ. Virginity is usually defined as the state of a person who has never engaged in sexual intercourse, although there are some gray areas. For example, teenagers that engage in oral sex but not penile-vaginal sex may still identify themselves as virgins; this is sometimes termed ''technical virginity.'' Of those polled, 70% of adolescents aged 11–16 believed oral sex did not disqualify someone from virginity, and 30% believed they were still abstinent.&lt;ref name="Defining virginity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freitas"/&gt;

Of adolescents age 11–16, 83% believe a person is still a virgin after engaging in genital touching, and 70% said they believed one retained their virginity after having oral sex. Additionally, 16% considered themselves virgins after anal sex. However, 44% believed that one was abstinent after genital touching and 33% believed one could have oral sex and still remain abstinent. Of anal and vaginal sex, 14% believed one could engage in the former and 12% said one could participate in the latter while still remaining abstinent.

Among those 15–19 years old, those who remain a "technical virgin" are motivated more by the fear of pregnancy or STIs and less by religion and morality.&lt;ref name="Freitas"/&gt;

==Physical effects==
The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] has identified the sexual behaviors of American adolescents as a major public health problem.&lt;ref name="PED media"/&gt;  The Academy is concerned about the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases in sexually active teenagers and about the very high rate of teenage pregnancy in the United States compared to other developed countries.

Research into adolescents' sexual behavior in situations outside traditional dating situations, commonly referred to as "hooking up", shows that adolescents underestimate the risk involved in such situations.&lt;ref name="manning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lescano"/&gt; With all the issues and problems relating to adolescent sex, "ideally, they won't be having sex."&lt;ref name="wisconsin"/&gt;

===Pregnancy===

{{Main|Teenage pregnancy in the United States|Teen pregnancy}}

Teen pregnancies—defined as pregnancies in women under the age of 20, regardless of marital status—in the United States decreased 28% between 1990 and 2000, from 117 pregnancies per every 1,000 teens to 84 per 1,000.&lt;ref name="kaiser FS"/&gt;  The 2008 rate was a record low and represented a 42% decline from the peak rate of 117 per 1,000, which occurred in 1990.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt; From 2009 to 2010, the teen pregnancy rate dropped 9%, the biggest one year drop since the 1940s.&lt;ref name="birth slide"/&gt;

Each year, almost 750,000 girls aged 15–19 become pregnant. Two-thirds of all teen pregnancies occur among the oldest teens (18–21-year-olds).&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt;  Of them, 82% are unplanned, accounting for about 20% of all unintended pregnancies annually.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt;  Of pregnancies among 15–19-year-olds girls in 2008, 59% ended in birth, 26% in abortion, and the rest in miscarriage.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt; Overall, 68 pregnancies occurred per 1,000 girls aged 15–19 in 2008. Nearly 7% of 15–19-year-old girls become pregnant each year. Pregnancies are much less common among girls younger than 15. In 2008, 6.6 pregnancies occurred per 1,000 teens aged 14 or younger. In other words, fewer than 1% of teens younger than 15 become pregnant each year.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt; Stillborn and newborn deaths are 50% higher for teen moms than women aged 20–29, and are more likely to have a low birth weight.&lt;ref name="WHO pregnancy 2012" /&gt;

Teenage [[birth rate]]s, as opposed to pregnancies, peaked in 1991, when there were 61.8 births per 1,000 teens, and the rate dropped in 17 of the 19 years that followed.&lt;ref name="birth slide"/&gt;  One in four American women who had sex during their teenage years will have a baby before they are married, compared to only one in ten who wait until they are older.&lt;ref name="Paik"/&gt;  Even more will experience a pregnancy.  Of women who have sex in their teens, nearly 30% will conceive a child before they are married. Conversely, only 15% of women who do not have sex in their teens will become pregnant before they are married.&lt;ref name="Paik"/&gt;  Of all women, 16% will be teen mothers.&lt;ref name="pregEthnic"/&gt;

According to a study, girls who participate in girls-only activities are far less likely to experience a teenage pregnancy and less likely to be sexually active in general.&lt;ref name="whitbeck"/&gt; Participating in competitive sports has also shown to have an effect for girls. A study published in 1999 found that female adolescents who participated in sports were less likely than their non-athletic peers to engage in sexual activity and/or report a pregnancy.&lt;ref name="sabo"/&gt; Males interested in arts are also less likely to be involved in a pregnancy situation. It is unclear whether these correlations are causal or the reflection of the underlying bias of the considered population. The study that reported these findings did not take into account the sexual orientation of the subjects.&lt;ref name="sabo"/&gt;

A survey by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy found that "7% of youth used alcohol the first time they had sex, and 6% used alcohol the most recent time they had sex."&lt;ref name="NCPTP"/&gt; In another study, teens aged 15–19 accounted for 15.5% of [[abortion]]s in 2009, and patients aged 20–24 made up 32.7%. Together adolescents aged 15–24 made up just under half (48.2%) of the 784,000 abortions reported to the CDC that year.&lt;ref name="CDC abortion 2009" /&gt;

According to one study, laws that require parental notification or consent before a minor can obtain an abortion "raise the cost of risky sex for teenagers."&lt;ref name="klick"/&gt; The study found that states which have enacted such laws have seen lower [[gonorrhea]] rates among teens than states that do not have such laws. The researchers of the study believe these laws lower the gonorrhea rate because teens reduce the amount of sexual activity they have and are more fastidious in their use of birth control.&lt;ref name="klick"/&gt; On the contrary, statistics released from the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicate that more restrictive laws on abortions do not necessarily mean fewer abortions; the abortion rate one year for Latin America (where, broadly speaking, abortions are generally made illegal) was 32 per 1000 people, whereas the abortion rate for Western Europe (where overall the laws are more relaxed) was 12 in 1000.&lt;ref name="WHO abortion 2012" /&gt;

===Sexually transmitted infections===
{{Main|Sexually transmitted disease|Safe sex}}
[[File:United States STD rates per 100,000 from 1941-2016.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|US Centers for Disease Control rates of reported syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea per 100,000 people, from 1941–2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Table 1.

Each year, between 8 and 10 million American teens contract a sexually transmitted infection (STI/STD),&lt;!--
[Display note on mouse hover]:

--&gt;{{refn|group=note|Although ''STD'' has been the term used the longest (for sexually transmitted disease), the preferred term now is ''STI'', for sexually transmitted infection, reflecting the fact that it is possible to become infected but not display any symptoms}}&lt;!--

"CDC 2011" bases its information on the very same study, making updating the CDC pdf sheet pointless --&gt;

Lloyd Kolbe, director of the [[Center for Disease Control]]'s Adolescent and School Health program, called the STI problem "a serious epidemic."&lt;ref name="risky"/&gt;  The younger an adolescent is when they first have any type of sexual relations, including oral sex, the more likely they are to get an STI.&lt;ref name="Kaestle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt;

HPV ([[Human papillomavirus]]) is the most common STI among teens (as well as adults).&lt;ref name="Dunne 2007"/&gt; In a CDC study, 18% of teen girls were infected with HPV.&lt;ref name="girls stds"/&gt; Another study found that HPV infections account for about half of STIs detected among 15- to 24-year-olds each year.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinstock"/&gt;  While HPV infections may not cause any disease and is often [[asymptomatic]], it can cause [[genital warts]] and even cancer.

After HPV, [[trichomoniasis]] and [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] are the most common STI diagnoses among 15- to 24-year-olds; combined, they account for slightly more than one third of diagnoses each year.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt; [[Genital herpes]] and [[gonorrhea]] together account for about 12% of diagnoses. [[HIV]], [[syphilis]] and [[hepatitis B]] account for less than 1% of diagnoses,&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt; however young people aged 13–24 accounted for about 21% of all new HIV diagnoses in the United States in 2011.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt;

Researchers from the CDC have noted that teenagers often do not understand the risks associated with sexual activity. "Research suggests that adolescents perceive fewer health-related risks for oral sex compared with vaginal intercourse. However, young people, particularly those who have oral sex before their first vaginal intercourse, may still be placing themselves at risk of STIs or HIV before they are ever at risk of pregnancy."&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt;  "Several studies have documented that oral sex can transmit certain STIs, including chlamydia, genital herpes, gonorrhea and syphilis. Teenagers and young adults engaging in sexual activity are at increased risk of STIs or HIV."&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt;

A 2008 study by the CDC found that one in four teen girls, or an estimated 3 million girls, has an STI.&lt;ref name="girls stds"/&gt; The study of 838 girls who participated in a 2003–04 government health survey found the highest overall prevalence among black girls; nearly half in the study were infected.  This is compared with 20% among both white and Mexican-American teens.&lt;ref name="Nearly 1 in 4 Teen Girls Has STD, CDC Says"/&gt; The same study found that, among those who were infected, 15% had more than one STI, and 20% of those who said they had only one sexual partner were infected.&lt;ref name="girls stds"/&gt;

In a 2011 study by the CDC, 7.1% of females and 2.1% of males aged 15–24 were infected with [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]],&lt;ref name="CDC 2011" /&gt;{{rp|65}} historically the most prevalent of all STIs in the general population (after HPV).

HPV is the most common STI among teens as well as adults.&lt;ref name="Dunne 2007"/&gt; In the CDC study, 18% of teen girls were infected with HPV.&lt;ref name="girls stds"/&gt; Another study found that HPV infections account for about half of STIs detected among 15- to 24-year-olds each year.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinstock"/&gt;  While HPV infections may not cause any disease and is often [[asymptomatic]], it can cause [[genital warts]] and even cancer.

[[Cervical cancer]] is the most common HPV-associated cancer&lt;ref name="huff hpv"/&gt; but may also cause others, including oral cancer, cancer of the anus, and cancer of the penis.&lt;ref name="huff hpv"/&gt;  In recent years there has been a huge surge in HPV-associated oral cancers.&lt;ref name="huff hpv"/&gt; Between 1988 and 2004, HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers rose 225%.&lt;ref name="huff hpv"/&gt;  "Oral sex is the primary culprit."&lt;ref name="huff hpv"/&gt;  The incidence of HPV-associated cancers that affect men is growing along with the cancers that affect women.&lt;ref name="huff hpv"/&gt;

An [[HPV vaccine]] protects women against some types of HPV, but not every type.  Even after being vaccinated girls can still come down with HPV related cancers and genital warts.&lt;ref name="CDC 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huff hpv"/&gt;  The vaccine is only effective before exposure to HPV.  "One concern within the medical community is that the vaccination will provide a false sense of security."&lt;ref name="huff hpv"/&gt;

In 2011, 53% of females aged 13–17 had received one or more doses of the vaccine against HPV; 35% had completed the recommended three doses.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt; Only 8% of boys had received one or more doses.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt;

The [[Precocious puberty|earlier onset of puberty]] can produce sexual drives at a time when teens are not yet fully socialized to understand the potential social and emotional consequences of sexual activities.&lt;ref name="USATodayTeens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sex lives" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Garn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caspi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stattin"/&gt;  Some scholars claim that the risk for depression is "clearly elevated" for the sexually active of either gender.&lt;ref name="Hallfors"/&gt;

"We tend to focus on the health consequences of having sex, like pregnancy and STIs, but we also need to talk to [teens] about all the emotional consequences," some experts say.&lt;ref name="UCSF"/&gt;

Some research suggests that two-thirds of sexually active girls wish they had waited longer before having sex.&lt;ref name="Lukas"/&gt; Of seniors in high school, 74% of girls regret sexual experiences they have had.&lt;ref name="The Truth about Sex by High School Senior Girls"/&gt;

For girls, even modest involvement in sexual experimentation elevates depression risk.&lt;ref name="depress"/&gt;  Sexually active teenage girls are more than twice as likely to suffer depression compared to those who are not sexually active.&lt;ref name="Sabia"/&gt;

Sex therapists have found that the roots of sexual issues facing adults often date back to regretful teenage experiences.&lt;ref name="UCSF"/&gt;  Research has also found that being abstinent in the teen years was associated with better mental health at age 29.&lt;ref name="Bogart"/&gt;  Girls who were virgins at age 18 were also less likely to have a mental illness at age 40.&lt;ref name="Finger"/&gt;

Girls are "at particular risk for experiencing negative social and emotional consequences of having any type of sex," including oral sex.&lt;ref name="uc"/&gt; Girls are more than twice as likely as boys to say they felt bad about themselves and more than three times as likely to say they felt used as a result of engaging in sex&lt;ref name="UCSF"/&gt; or hookups.&lt;ref name="UCSF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sax"/&gt;

In a study of casual sex among adolescents, many girls believed they could have a purely sexual experience with no emotional ties, and they believed it was sexist to assume otherwise.  However, the study found that both the girls and the boys who were hooking up often were depressed and didn't feel very good about themselves.&lt;ref name="Denizet-Lewis"/&gt;

===Effects on relationships===
When engaging in sexual acts the body produces [[oxytocin]], a chemical produced in the brain to promote feelings of connection and love.  Production of oxytocin increases during the adolescent years. It has a larger effect on girls, suggesting it may make them care more about relationships and feel connections with others more intensely than boys.&lt;ref name="Blades" /&gt;&lt;ref name="large"/&gt;

==Dating violence and sexual assault==
{{Main|Teen dating violence|Sexual assault|Domestic violence|Date rape}}
Teen dating violence is defined as the physical, sexual, psychological or emotional violence within a dating relationship, as well as stalking.&lt;ref name="CDC 2009 dating violence"&gt;{{cite web|title=CDC - Teen Dating Violence - Intimate Partner Violence - Violence Prevention - Injury|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/teen_dating_violence.html|publisher=CDC|accessdate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes electronic forms (e.g., threatening text messages, excessive yelling or cursing at someone in a phone message) as well as face-to-face forms.&lt;ref name="CDC 2009 dating violence" /&gt;

Girls who have engaged in sexual intercourse are five times more likely than their virgin peers to be the victim of dating violence.&lt;ref name="violence"/&gt;  Girls who were intentionally hurt by a date in the past 12 months are at a "significantly elevated risk for a broad range of sexual health concerns and for pregnancy."&lt;ref name="violence"/&gt;  Girls who have been victims are also twice as likely to report high levels of multiple sexual partners.&lt;ref name="violence"/&gt;

Sexual assault is any involuntary sexual act in which a person is threatened, coerced, or forced to engage against their will, or any sexual touching of a person who has not consented. This includes but is not limited to [[rape]] (forcible [[sexual penetration]]), [[groping]], forced kissing, or the torture of the victim in a sexual manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Assault - FAQs|url=http://www.4woman.gov/faq/sexualassault.htm|publisher=Womenshealth.gov|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024160615/http://www.4woman.gov//faq/sexualassault.htm|archivedate=October 24, 2008|date=January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.nt.ca/pdf/VictimsServices/Sexaul_AssaultENG.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418181753/http://www.justice.gov.nt.ca/pdf/VictimsServices/Sexaul_AssaultENG.pdf |archivedate=April 18, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In legal terms, sexual assault is a statutory offense in the United States, varying widely state-to-state.

Outside of law, the term ''rape ''has a less distinguished meaning and is often used interchangeably with sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Victimology: Theories and Applications"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Roberts, Albert R. |author2=Ann Wolbert Bergess |author3=CHERYL REGEHR |title=Victimology: Theories and Applications |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers |location=Sudbury, Mass |year=2009 |page=228 |isbn=978-0-7637-7210-9 |oclc= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=erFiYbLL9McC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=definition+of+rape&amp;q=definition%20of%20rape |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Violence against women"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Krantz G, Garcia-Moreno C |title=Violence against women |journal=J Epidemiol Community Health |volume=59 |issue=10 |pages=818–21 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16166351 |pmc=1732916 |doi=10.1136/jech.2004.022756 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most rape victims are in their teens or young twenties: according to a study by the CDC and Department of Justice, 83% of rape victims interviewed were under the age of 25, and 54% were under the age of 18. 1 in 6 women had been raped in the study, and 1 in 33 men.&lt;ref name="Rape stats" /&gt; 1 in 5 women and 1 in 7 men who have experienced sexual violence first experienced this through dating violence as a teen.&lt;ref name="February message" /&gt;

Teen sexual violence does not always equate with [[date rape]], as the term might suggest; the term ''date rape'' may describe [[drug facilitated sexual assault]] (using drugs and/or alcohol), or a case of [[acquaintance rape]] (usually sexual assault by someone the victim doesn't know well, or just met).&lt;ref name="womenshealth.gov"&gt;[http://www.womenshealth.gov/faq/date-rape-drugs.cfm Date Rape Drugs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223134527/http://www.womenshealth.gov/faq/date-rape-drugs.cfm |date=February 23, 2014 }}.

==Legal issues==

===Sexting===
{{Main|Sexting}}
[[Sexting]], the sending of sexually explicit messages and/or photographs, has become increasingly popular with adolescents.  However, according to some studies, sexting can "glamorize and normalize sex in a way that might cause some teenagers to start having sex earlier, or in unhealthy ways."&lt;ref name="McCarthy"/&gt;

More than one fifth of teens have sent sexually suggestive text messages or nude photographs of themselves online.&lt;ref name="sexting"/&gt;  Teens who photograph or film themselves or receive photos of others, known as sexting, can be charged with child pornography.&lt;ref name="A.H."/&gt;  Others who post the photos online could also be charged with child pornography and face prison time.&lt;ref name="childporn"/&gt; Sexting can be considered sexual harassment.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"/&gt;

Sexting is linked to psychological distress among teens. Those involved in sexting are more likely to report a suicide attempt, and have twice the odds of reporting depressive symptoms as students who aren't involved in sexting.  "For girls who send the sexts ... there is a disillusionment and a sense of betrayal when it's posted everywhere. When it gets forwarded to multiple boys at multiple schools and also other girls ... a girl starts getting called names and her reputation is ruined."&lt;ref name="firstcoastnews.com"/&gt;

Boys who are victims of sexually predatory teenage girls can also be devastated.  Sexually predatory girls will ask a boy, particularly a sexually naive boy, for photos, and "he's sort of flattered and he feels like a big guy and then she sends them around."&lt;ref name="firstcoastnews.com"/&gt;  Unbeknownst to them at the time, their compliance can cause lasting harm.

Often girls who take racy photos of themselves "want to be admired, want someone to want them. A lot of them are lonely and starved for attention. A lot of girls believe they have no choice but to pose in this way. There are also the thrill seekers who do it because it's 'edgy and cool.'"&lt;ref name="childporn" /&gt;

Experts say that sexting poses a serious problem, partly because teens do not understand that the images are permanent and can be spread quickly.  "It does not click that what they're doing is destructive, let alone illegal."&lt;ref name="Keane"/&gt;  "Once they are out there, it spreads like a virus," police say.&lt;ref name="Boyle"/&gt;

===Age of consent===
{{Main| Ages of consent in the United States|Statutory rape}}
{{For| a comprehensive list of ages state-by-state|Ages of consent in the United States#State laws}}

Each state has its own [[age of consent]]. Currently, state laws designate the age of consent as 16, 17, or 18, with more than half of the states designating 16 as the age limit. However, the five most populous states all have a higher age of consent (California: 18, Texas: 17, Florida: 18, New York: 17 and Illinois: 17).

In some common law jurisdictions, statutory rape is sexual activity in which one person is below the age required to legally consent to the behavior.&lt;ref name=ojjdp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/208803.pdf |format=PDF |title=Statutory Rape Known to Law Enforcement |accessdate=March 24, 2008 |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice - Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it usually refers to adults engaging in sex with minors under the age of consent,&lt;ref name=ojjdp /&gt; it is a generic term, and very few jurisdictions use the actual term "statutory rape" in the language of statutes.&lt;ref name=ovc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ovc/publications/infores/statutoryrape/handbook/statrape.pdf |format=PDF |title=State Legislators' Handbook for Statutory Rape Issues |accessdate=March 24, 2008 |publisher=U.S Department of Justice - Office for Victims of Crime |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313100531/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ovc//publications/infores/statutoryrape/handbook/statrape.pdf |archive-date=March 13, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In statutory rape, overt force or threat need not be present. The laws presume coercion, because a minor or mentally challenged adult is legally incapable of giving consent to the act. Statutory rape laws are based on the premise that until a person reaches a certain age, he or she is legally incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse. Thus, even if a minor engages in sexual intercourse willingly, the intercourse is not consensual.&lt;ref name=gutt2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2903097.html |title=Can Statutory Rape Laws Be Effective in Preventing Adolescent Pregnancy? |accessdate=March 24, 2008 |publisher=Guttmacher Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, teenage couples engage in sexual conduct as part of an intimate relationship. This may occur before either participant has reached the age of consent, or after one has but the other has not. In the latter case, in most jurisdictions, the person who has reached the age of consent is guilty of statutory rape. In some jurisdictions (such as California), if two minors have sex with each other, they are both guilty of engaging in unlawful sex with the other person.&lt;ref&gt;http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/cacode/PEN/3/1/9/1/s261.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_4783650 | work=Denver Post | first=Pamela | last=Manson | title=Girl, 13, charged as sex offender and victim | date=December 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act itself is [[prima facie]] evidence of guilt when one participant is incapable of legally consenting.

Some jurisdictions have passed so-called "[[Romeo and Juliet laws]]," which serve to reduce or eliminate the penalty of the crime in cases where the couple's age difference is minor and the sexual contact would not have been rape if both partners were legally able to give consent.

==Social and cultural influences==

===Media===
{{main|Media and American adolescent sexuality}}
The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] has argued that media representations of sexuality may influence teen sexual behavior;&lt;ref name="PED media"/&gt; this view is supported by various scholars,&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strasburger"/&gt; while other scholars disagree.&lt;ref name="Steinberg"/&gt;

Research indicates that sexual messages contained in film, television, and music are becoming more explicit in dialog, lyrics, and behavior. In television programming aimed at teens, more than 90% of episodes had at least one sexual reference in it with an average of 7.9 references per hour.&lt;ref name="aubrey"/&gt; Researchers have found a correlation between the amount of television with high sexual content that teenagers watch and an increased likelihood of them becoming pregnant or fathering a child out of wedlock, and believe that reducing the amount of sexual content adolescents watch on television could substantially reduce the teen pregnancy rate.&lt;ref name="tv sex"/&gt; By contrast, other scholars have argued that such claims have been premature; Steinberg and Monahan found that media effects diminished once other factors were controlled.&lt;ref name="Steinberg"/&gt;

Scholarly studies suggest that approximately 15% of youth intentionally seek [[pornography]] in a given year.&lt;ref name="Ybarra"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Michele Ybarra |author2=Kimberly Mitchell | title=Exposure to Internet Pornography among Children and Adolescents| journal=Cyber Psychology| year=2005| volume=8| issue=5| url=http://www.unh.edu/ccrc/pdf/jvq/CV76.pdf| doi=10.1089/cpb.2005.8.473|pmid=16232040 | pages=473–486|citeseerx=10.1.1.608.7977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Donna Freitas, author of ''The End of Sex: How Hookup Culture is Leaving a Generation Unhappy, Sexually Unfulfilled, and Confused About Intimacy'', has this to say about porn:&lt;ref name="Freitas"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many boys learn to assume that the things women do in porn&amp;mdash;how they dress and act around men&amp;mdash;is also how women are supposed to act in real life. These same boys are learning to expect girls their own age to act like the women in porn videos, too&amp;nbsp; ... &amp;nbsp;Social media and Internet porn are influencing junior-high and high-school girls' understanding of sexiness. Girls are learning to use porn and porn archetypes to impress boys as early as middle school.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Peers===
Both boys and girls feel pressure from their friends to have sex. The perception adolescents have of their best friends' sexual behavior has a significant association with their own sex behavior.&lt;ref name="Prinstein"/&gt;  Sexually active peers have a negative effect on adolescent sexual delay; however, responsive parent-adolescent sex discussions can buffer these effects.&lt;ref name="Fasula"/&gt;

In a 2003 study, 89% of girls reported feeling pressured by boys to have sex, while 49% of boys reported feeling pressured by girls to have sex.  In contrast, 67% of boys felt pressured by other boys, while 53% of girls felt pressured by other girls.&lt;ref name="kaiser gender roles"/&gt;

Adolescents who reported sexual activity had high levels of reputation-based popularity, but not likeability among peers; however, sex with more partners was associated with lower levels of popularity.&lt;ref name="Prinstein"/&gt;

==Sexual education given to teens==
{{Main|Sex education in the United States}}
Two main forms of sex education are taught in American schools: comprehensive and [[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only]]. Comprehensive sex education covers abstinence as a positive choice, but also teaches about contraception use and the avoidance of STIs if the teen becomes  sexually active. A 2002 study conducted by the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] found that 58% of secondary school principals describe their sex education curriculum as comprehensive.&lt;ref name="Kaiser 2002"/&gt;  The difference between these two approaches, and their impact on teen behavior, remains a controversial subject in the United States.

There have been numerous studies on the effectiveness of both approaches, and conflicting data on American public opinion. Public opinion polls conducted over the years have found that the majority of Americans favor broader sex education programs over those that teach only abstinence, although abstinence educators recently published poll data with the totally opposite conclusion.&lt;ref name="Sex Education: Politicians, Parents, Teachers and Teens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="On Our Side: Public Support for Comprehensive Sexuality Education"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NAEA Executive Summary of Key Findings"/&gt; The poll sponsored by the National Abstinence Education Association and conducted by [[Zogby International]] found that:&lt;ref name="zogby"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When parents become aware of what abstinence education vs. comprehensive sex education actually teaches, support for abstinence programs jumps from 40% to 60%, while support for comprehensive programs drops from 50% to 30%. This sharp increase in support of abstinence education is seen across all political and economic groups. The majority of parents reject the so-called "comprehensive" sex education approach, which focuses on promoting and demonstrating contraceptive use. Sixty-six percent of parents think that the importance of the "wait to have sex" message ends up being lost when programs demonstrate and encourage the use of contraception.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Experts also encourage sex educators to include oral sex and emotional concerns as part of their curriculum.  Their findings also support earlier studies that conclude:&lt;ref name="uc" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... sexual risk-taking should be considered from a dynamic relationship perspective, rather than solely from a traditional disease-model perspective. Prevention programs rarely discuss adolescents' social and emotional concerns regarding sex ...  Discussion about potential negative consequences, such as experiencing guilt or feeling used by one's partner, may lead some adolescents to delay the onset of sexual behavior until they feel more sure of the strength of their relationship with a partner and more comfortable with the idea of becoming sexually active. Identification of common negative social and emotional consequences of having sex may also be useful in screening for adolescents at risk of experiencing more-serious adverse outcomes after having sex.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Comprehensive ===
The [[National Association of School Psychologists]],&lt;ref name="NASP"/&gt; the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]],&lt;ref name="AAP"/&gt; the [[American Public Health Association]],&lt;ref name="APHA"/&gt; the Society for Adolescent Medicine&lt;ref name="Adolescent Health"/&gt; and the American College Health Association,&lt;ref name="Adolescent Health"/&gt; have all stated official support for comprehensive sex education. Comprehensive sex education curricula are intended to reduce sexually transmitted infections and out-of-wedlock or teenage pregnancies.

Proponents of this approach argue that sexual behavior after puberty is a given, and it is therefore crucial to provide information about the risks and how they can be minimized.  They hold that abstinence-only sex ed and [[social conservatism|conservative]] moralizing will only alienate students and thus weaken the message.

A report issued by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] has found the "most consistent and clear finding is that sex education does not cause adolescents to initiate sex when they would not otherwise have done so." The same report also found that:&lt;ref name="Beginning" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Family life or sex education in the public schools, which traditionally has consisted largely of providing factual information at the secondary school level, is the most general or pervasive approach to preventing pregnancy among adolescents ... Adolescents who begin having sexual intercourse need to understand the importance of using an effective contraceptive every time they have sex. This requires convincing sexually active teens who have never used contraception to do so. In addition, sexually active teens who sometimes use contraceptives need to use them more consistently (every time they have sex) and use them correctly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Abstinence-only ===
{{Main|Abstinence-only sex education}}
Abstinence-only sex education tells teenagers that they should be sexually abstinent until marriage and does not provide information about contraception. In the Kaiser study, 34% of high-school principals said their school's main message was abstinence-only. Some Christian organizations advocate abstinence-only sex education because it is the only approach they find acceptable and in accordance with their churches' teachings.

Some organizations promote what they consider to be "sexual purity", which encompasses abstaining from not only intercourse before marriage, but also from sexual thoughts, sexual touching, pornography, and actions that are known to lead to sexual arousal. Advocates of abstinence-only sex education object to comprehensive curricula which fail to teach moral behavior; they maintain that curricula should promote conventional (or conservative) morality as healthy and constructive, and that value-free knowledge of the body may lead to immoral, unhealthy and harmful practices.

A comprehensive review of 115 program evaluations published in November 2007 by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy found that two-thirds of sex education programs focusing on both abstinence and contraception had a positive effect on teen sexual behavior. The same study found no strong evidence that programs that stress abstinence as the only acceptable behavior for unmarried teens delayed the initiation of sex, hastened the return to abstinence, or reduced the number of sexual partners.&lt;ref name="emerging answers"/&gt;  According to the study author:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even though there does not exist strong evidence that any particular abstinence program is effective at delaying sex or reducing sexual behavior, one should not conclude that all abstinence programs are ineffective. After all, programs are diverse, fewer than 10 rigorous studies of these programs have been carried out, and studies of two programs have provided modestly encouraging results. In sum, studies of abstinence programs have not produced sufficient evidence to justify their widespread dissemination.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== From parents ===
Most teens (70%) say they have gotten some or a lot of information about sex and sexual relationships from their parents.  Other sources of information include friends at 53%, school, also at 53%, TV and movies at 51% and magazines at 34%.  School and magazines were sources of information for more girls than boys, and teens "who were sexually active were much more likely to say they got information about sex from their friends and partners."&lt;ref name="Couric" /&gt; Less than half of parents with daughters under 18 talk to their girls about how to say no to boys, and about half talk to them about contraception.&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt;

Adolescents whose parents talked to them at a young age felt more comfortable as they grew and were more likely to make personal decisions about sexual behavior that reflects the parental values and morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Geasler M. J. |author2=Dannison L. L. |author3=Edlund C. J. | year = 1995 | title = Sexuality education of young children: parental concerns | url = | journal = Family Relations | volume = 44 | issue = 2| pages = 184–188 | doi=10.2307/584807|jstor=584807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars argue that parents have a large influence on how teen sexuality is viewed in the United States, as well as how teens view their own sexuality.&lt;ref name=Schalet&gt;{{citation |last=Schalet |first=Amy |date= |title=Not Under My Roof: Parents, Teens, and the Culture of Sex |url= |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents' views of adolescent sexuality vary greatly between different countries. In the United States, teen sexuality is generally viewed under the framework of "adversarial individualism".&lt;ref name=Schalet/&gt; This means that on a broader, societal level, there is little communication among individuals as compared to other countries such as the Netherlands where there is more emphasis on "interdependent individualism".&lt;ref name=Schalet/&gt; Scholars argue that in the United States, there is greater emphasis on individual success rather than success of the majority.&lt;ref name=Schalet/&gt; This paradigm plays into adolescent sexuality in the way that there is less communication about oftentimes sensitive topics such as adolescent sexuality.&lt;ref name=Schalet/&gt; Scholars argue that this mentality has several consequences.&lt;ref name=Schalet/&gt; The negative consequences of adversarial individualism can present themselves as impulse-driven teenagers that ultimately require more supervision than teenagers living in an interdependent individualistic society. In interdependent individualism, teenagers are ultimately more responsible because they are able to have open discussions with their guardians.&lt;ref name=Schalet/&gt;

==== Father-daughter communication ====

Studies have suggested that fathers generally tend to avoid sexual conversations with their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Heisler J. M. | year = 2005 | title = Family communication about sex: parents and college-aged offspring recall discussion topics, satisfaction, and parental involvement | url = | journal = The Journal of Family Communication | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 295–312 | doi=10.1207/s15327698jfc0504_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many fathers have uncertainties on how to start to the conversation. Other times they simply put the initiative on their daughters to come to them with questions or issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wilson E. K. |author2=Dalberth B. T. |author3=Koo H.P. |author4=Gard J. C. | year = 2010 | title = Parents' perspectives on talking to preteenage children about sex | url = | journal = Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health | volume = 42 | issue = 1| pages = 56–63 | doi=10.1363/4205610|pmid=20415887 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when the conversation is launched fathers tend to be judgmental or only talk about abstinence. Fathers are more likely to forbid daughters from having sex when they are talking. Wilson et al. (2010) found that some fathers felt that talking about the potential consequences of sex was easier than talking about sex itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wilson E. K. |author2=Dalberth B. T. |author3=Koo H. P. | year = 2010 | title = We're the heroes!": fathers' perspectives on their role in protecting their preteenage children from sexual risk | url = | journal = Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health | volume = 42 | issue = 2| pages = 117–124 | doi=10.1363/4211710|pmid=20618751 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fathers overall tend to apply more orders when talking to their daughters than giving them unbiased information or simply listening and trying to give them their best advice.

Hutchinson and Cederbaum (2011) studied father-daughter communication and found that increased father-daughter communication delayed sexual debut and decreased the frequency of engagement in sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Hitchinson K. M., Cederbaum J. A. 2011 550–572"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hitchinson K. M. |author2=Cederbaum J. A. | year = 2011 | title = Talking to daddy's little girl about sex: daughters' reports of sexual communication and support from fathers | url = | journal = Journal of Family Issues | volume = 32 | issue = 4| pages = 550–572 | doi = 10.1177/0192513x10384222 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also found that responsible sexual behavior among adolescent females was associated with positive father-daughter communication regarding men, dating, sex, and marriage. On the other hand, fathers who were absent had been linked to higher rates of sexual activity and teen pregnancy among female adolescents.&lt;ref name="Hitchinson K. M., Cederbaum J. A. 2011 550–572"/&gt; Fathers have a greater impact on daughters than they think, but fail to recognize it because they don't believe they should be discussing sex with their daughters or simply leave it to the mothers.

==Correlations==
{{see also|Religion and adolescent sexuality}}
Girls who participate in athletics, artistic, or academic extracurricular activities are less likely to be sexually active than girls who don't participate in any. Female athletes have "significantly fewer sex partners, engaged in less frequent intercourse ... and began having sex at a later age." For boys, those who participate in sports are slightly more likely to be sexually active, and those who are in artistic activities are considerably less likely.&lt;ref name="sports"/&gt;

Religious adolescents lose their virginity three years later than the average American. On average, those with strong religious backgrounds become sexually active at age 21.&lt;ref name="religion"/&gt;

Studies have shown stressed teens and teens without sufficient familial involvement tend to have more sex.&lt;ref name="Sibling"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dads"/&gt;

==Sexual minorities==
According to a study based on a sampling of teenagers in Massachusetts, sexual minority youth—that is, those who identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual or had any same-sex sexual contact in their lifetimes—were significantly more likely than other students to report lifetime sexual intercourse (72% vs. 44%).&lt;ref name="myrbs"/&gt; The same study found that sexual minority youth were more likely to report sexual intercourse before age 13 (18% vs. 4%), sexual intercourse with four or more partners in their lifetimes (32% vs. 11%), and recent sexual intercourse (55% vs. 33%). Among students in the Massachusetts study who ever had sexual intercourse in their lifetimes, sexual minority youth were significantly more likely than other students to report "having been or gotten someone pregnant (15% vs. 4%) and having been diagnosed with [[HIV]] or another STI (10% vs. 5%)."&lt;ref name="myrbs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bay windows"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3508">In the [[Japanese language]], '''Aizuchi''' ({{lang-ja|[[wikt:相槌|相槌]]}} or {{lang|ja|[[wikt:あいづち|あいづち]]}}, {{IPA-ja|aizu͍t͡ɕi|IPA}}) are the frequent [[interjection]]s during a conversation that indicate the listener is paying attention or understands the speaker. In linguistic terms, these are a form of [[phatic]] expression. Aizuchi are considered reassuring to the speaker, indicating that the listener is active and involved in the discussion.&lt;ref&gt; Miller, Laura.  1983. Aizuchi: Japanese Listening Behavior. MA Thesis, anthropology, UCLA. &lt;/ref&gt;

Aizuchi are frequently misinterpreted by non-native speakers as the listener showing agreement or fully comprehending what is being said.&lt;ref&gt; Miller, Laura.  1991.“Verbal listening behavior in conversations between Japanese and Americans.” In The Pragmatics of Intercultural and International Communication, edited by Jan Blommaert and Jef Verschueren, John Benjamins, Amsterdam, pp. 110–130. &lt;/ref&gt;

Common aizuchi include: 
* {{Nihongo3||はい|hai}}, {{Nihongo3||ええ|ee}}, or {{Nihongo3||うん|un}} (yes, with varying degrees of formality)
* {{Nihongo3||そうですね|sō desu ne}} (I see.)
* {{Nihongo3||そうですか|sō desu ka}} (is that so?)
* {{Nihongo3||本当|hontō}}, {{Nihongo3||本当に|hontō ni}}, {{Nihongo3||マジ|maji}}, or (in [[Kansai]]) {{Nihongo3||本真|honma}}  (really)
* {{Nihongo3||なるほど|naruhodo}} (I see, that's right)
* [[nodding]]
These can be compared to English "yeah, yeah", "yeah, ok", "got it", "yep", "uhuh" or "go on", but are more pronounced and important in Japanese.{{fact|date=March 2016}}

Business relations in particular can be hampered by non-native speakers assuming that their [[Japan]]ese counterparts have been agreeing to their suggestions all along, when in reality the Japanese have only been saying that they follow or understand the suggestions – "got it", not "agreed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aizuchi can also take the form of so-called echo questions, which consist of a noun plus "desu ka". After Speaker A asks a question, Speaker B may repeat a key noun followed by "desu ka" to confirm what Speaker A was talking about or simply to keep communication open while Speaker B thinks of an answer. A rough English analog would be "A ..., you say?", as in: "So I bought this new car"; reply: "A car, you say?".

&lt;!--[[File:Amarna tablet.jpg|thumb|EA 35, ''obverse''. &lt;br /&gt;(''"Out-of-Focus"'') &lt;br /&gt;The fractured upper left corner shows the surface gloss of the [[clay tablet]], and its non-gloss interior; similar high surface-gloss letters are [[Amarna letter EA 9|EA 9]], [[Amarna letter EA 23|EA 23]], EA 153, and [[Amarna letter EA 362|EA 362]].]]--&gt;

'''Amarna letter EA 153''', titled: ''Ships on Hold,''&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Moran|Moran, William L.]] 1987, 1992. ''The Amarna Letters.'' EA 153, ''Ships on Hold,'' p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; is a short-length [[clay tablet]] letter from [[Abimilku]] of the island (at [[Amarna letters]] time) of [[city-state]] [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].

EA 153 is approximately {{convert|7.7|cm|in|0}} tall x {{convert|5.2|cm|in|0}} wide,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/544696&lt;/ref&gt; (actually 3 1/16 x 2 1/16 inches), and has a missing flaked, lower right corner on its obverse affecting two lines of text. One line repeats ''"...King, Lord-mine...,"'' allowing for only one line of more difficult restoration.

The letter shows a high-gloss surface on the [[clay tablet]], and being a short letter, has only 5 to 8/9 cuneiform characters per line. It contains one special cuneiform sign for ''ship'', MÁ, [[MÁ (ship Sumerogram)]], a sign used in both the Amarna letters, and the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''. Also, the letter's [[scribe]] used mostly 'very-short' stroked, and 'fat-and-rounded' cuneiform strokes,&lt;ref&gt;http://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/eg/web-large/vs24.2.12yy.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; instead of the more 'arrow-shaped', sharp, and linear strokes, [[File:C+B-Persia-Cuneiform2.PNG|100x24px]]. Since on EA 153, there are also distinct, medium-sized wedge strokes, (example ''"[[bad (cuneiform)|be]]"'' [[File:B113ellst.png|100x24px]]) as well as L-shaped strokes (angled stylus), the scribe may have used 2 or more styluses.

The clay tablet letter is located in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], no. 24.2.12.

The [[Amarna letters]], about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are mid 14th century BC, about [[1350 BC]] and 25? years later, [[Text corpus|correspondence]]. The initial corpus of letters were found at [[Akhenaten]]'s city Akhetaten, in the floor of the [[Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh]]; others were later found, adding to the body of letters.

Other features include national profiles, [[GIS]] maps, church membership overviews, denominational heritage trees, historical timelines, tables, charts, and other summary reports.

Founded as the American Religion Data Archive in 1997, and online since 1998,&lt;ref name="Berkley Center"/&gt; the archive was initially targeted at researchers interested in American religion. In February 2006, the American Religion Data Archive became the Association of Religion Data Archives when an international data archive was added.&lt;ref name="Finke 2007 21–34"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finke|first=Roger |author2=Christopher D. Bader |author3=Edward C. Polson|title=A Growing Web of Resources: The Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA)|journal=Review of Religion Research|year=2007|volume=49|issue=1|pages=21–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archive now includes both American and international collections as well as features for educators, journalists, religious congregations, and researchers.

Data included in the ARDA are submitted by the foremost religion scholars and research centers in the world. Currently housed in the Social Science Research Institute at [[Pennsylvania State University]], the ARDA is funded by [[Lilly Endowment]], the [[John Templeton Foundation]], [[Chapman University]], and Pennsylvania State University.&lt;ref name="Finke 2007 21–34"/&gt;

==History==
[[Roger Finke]], then professor of sociology at [[Purdue University]], founded the American Religion Data Archive in 1996 on a grant from [[Lilly Endowment]]. Data file collection and processing began in 1997. The online archive launched in the fall of 1998 under the domain name www.thearda.com, and originally contained thirty-three surveys regarding American religion.&lt;ref name="Merino 2008- 2009 3–17"/&gt; Within ten years, the archive had expanded to include more than 400 data files. {{As of|2016}}, more than 900 data files were available for download on the ARDA website.

Starting in 2005, the ARDA began to host surveys dealing with religion outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finke|first=Roger|author2=Amy Adamczyk|title=The Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA): Online Research Data, Tools, and References|journal=Politics and Religion|year=2008|volume=1|issue=3|pages=456–470|doi=10.1017/s1755048308000412|pmid=25484914|pmc=4254728}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finke|first=Roger|author2=Christopher D. Bader|author3=Edward C. Polson|title=A Growing Web of Resources: The Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) www.theARDA.com|journal=Review of Religious Research|year=2007|volume=49|issue=1|pages=21–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the archive therefore changed its name from the American Religion Data Archive to the Association of Religion Data Archives to more properly reflect the scope of information available. The new name preserved both the acronym and the domain name from the American Religion Data Archive.&lt;ref name="Merino 2008- 2009 3–17"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merino|first=Stephen M|author2=Roger Finke|title=Stimulating Research and Discovery in the Study of Religion: The Association of Religion Data Archives (www.theARDA.com)|journal=Geographies of Religions and Belief Systems|year=2008–2009|volume=3|issue=1|pages=3–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its founding, the ARDA has moved from Purdue to the Population Research Institute at [[Pennsylvania State University]],&lt;ref name="Merino 2008- 2009 3–17"/&gt; where is still run under the direction of Roger Finke, with the assistance of Christopher Bader of Chapman University.&lt;ref name="ARDA"&gt;{{cite web|title=ARDA|url=http://www.thearda.com/about/|work=About the ARDA|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff has, since 1997, expanded to include a research team of religion experts and graduate students, a marketing and web development team, a team of editors for guiding papers and working papers, a learning center editor, and a press room editor.&lt;ref name="ARDA"/&gt;

==Overview==
The primary component of the ARDA, the data archive, contains around 775 quantitative data files {{as of|2014|02|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="Data Archive Alphabetical Listing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Archive Alphabetical Listing|url=http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Browse_a.asp|work=ARDA|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARDA staff do not themselves collect the data encompassed in these files; rather, the surveys' principal investigators submit their data to the ARDA for processing and archiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merino|first=Stephen M.|author2=Roger Finke|title=Stimulating Research and Discovery in the Study of Religion: The Association of Religion Data Archives (www.theARDA.com)|journal=Geographies of Religions and Belief Systems|date=2008|volume=3|issue=1|pages=3–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the data files currently included in the archive originate from almost 200 different sources. Major data file contributors include the Presbyterian Panel Survey, the Southern Focus Poll, the U.S. Congregational Life Survey, and the Middletown Area Study. Data from the [[General Social Survey]], the [[American National Election Studies]], the World Religion Dataset, and the [[Pew Research Center]] are also available.&lt;ref name="Data Archive Alphabetical Listing"/&gt; Among the most common topics of information included are public opinions regarding social issues (e.g. [[abortion]], homosexuality, the role of women), survey respondents' perceptions of God/the divine, and survey respondents' religious affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measurement Wizard|url=http://www.thearda.com/MaWizard/|work=ARDA|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to archived survey data, the ARDA also provides information regarding the religious composition of, and the state of religious freedom in, the 232 nations currently recognized by the [[United States State Department]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Profiles|url=http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/|work=ARDA|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; membership and distributional data and historical lineages ("Family Trees") of major world religions and U.S. denominations thereof;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Group Profiles|url=http://www.thearda.com/denoms/families/groups.asp|work=ARDA|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various learning tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Learning Center|url=http://www.thearda.com/learningcenter/|work=ARDA|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bi-weekly journalistic article dealing with matters of religion and (usually American) public life, written by David Briggs, also appears on the ARDA website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Press Room|url=http://blogs.thearda.com/trend/|work=ARDA|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article is cross-posted to the [[Huffington Post]], for which Briggs also writes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Briggs|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-briggs/|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the ARDA began providing interactive historical timelines of religion in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Religion Timelines|url=http://thearda.com/timeline/|website=Association of Religion Data Archives|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are three interactive timelines listed: Prominent Religious Events and People, Baptist Events and People, and Catholic Events and People.

'''Axel [[Boëthius (family)|Boëthius]]''' (July 18, 1889 in [[Arvika]], [[Sweden]] &amp;ndash; May 7, 1969 in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]) was a scholar and archaeologist of [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] culture. Boëthius was primarily a student of Etruscan and Italic architecture. His father was the historian [[Simon Boëthius]].&lt;ref&gt;Medwid, Linda M. ''The Makers of Classical Archaeology: A Reference Work''. New York: Humanity Books, 2000 pp.&amp;nbsp;42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Shellie. "Boëthius, Axel." ''Encyclopedia of the History of Classical Archaeology''. Nancy Thomson de Grummond, ed. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1996, vol. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;167–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a student, Boëthius studied at the [[Uppsala University]], where he completed his Ph.D. in 1918. He taught at Uppsala (1921–24) during which time he excavated at [[Mycenae]] in Greece. In 1925 he was selected as the first director of the [[Swedish Institute at Rome]] by the Swedish crown prince [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustav Adolf]] (also known as an accomplished amateur archaeologist). He became professor of archaeology at the [[Göteborg University]] in 1934, a post he held until 1955. He also served as rector of the university (1946–51). In 1955, he retired to Italy. There he published his book ''Golden House of Nero'' in 1960, which was the product of the Thomas Spencer Jerome Lectures&lt;ref&gt;https://www.press.umich.edu/browse/series/UM18&lt;/ref&gt; given in Rome.&lt;ref name="Boethius2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Axel Boethius|title=The Golden House of Nero: Some Aspects of Roman Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hu38mwEACAAJ|date=20 April 2013|publisher=Literary Licensing, LLC|isbn=978-1-258-67096-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boëthius, working together with [[John Bryan Ward-Perkins]], wrote the section on Etruscan architecture for the prestigious ''Pelican History of Art'' series. The volume was published in 1970, shortly after his death in 1969.&lt;ref name="BoëthiusLing1978"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Axel Boëthius|author2=Roger Ling|author3=Tom Rasmussen|title=Etruscan and Early Roman Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1nZswjfqROUC|year=1978|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-05290-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward-Perkins, John.

&lt;/ref&gt; Tilley is the author of a biography of the Australian performer [[Leigh Bowery]] titled ''Leigh Bowery, The Life and Times of an Icon''. Tilley was introduced to Freud by Bowery, who was already modelling for him. Freud painted a number of large portraits of her around the period 1994&amp;ndash;96, and came to call her "Big Sue". He said of her body "It's flesh without muscle and it has developed a different kind of texture through bearing such a weight-bearing thing".&lt;ref&gt;[[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]], Exhibition booklet for ''Lucian Freud Portraits'', 2012, Section VII&lt;/ref&gt; 

The painting held the world record for the highest price paid for a painting by a living artist when it was sold by [[Guy Naggar]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cbdd4f36-5529-11dd-ae9c-000077b07658.html#axzz3l3nusfDK&lt;/ref&gt; for US$33.6 million (£17.2 million)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Betteridge's law of headlines''' is an [[adage]] that states: "Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word ''no''." It is named after Ian Betteridge, a British technology journalist who wrote about it in 2009,&lt;ref name="betteridge2009"&gt;{{cite web |author=Betteridge, Ian |url=http://www.technovia.co.uk/2009/02/techcrunch-irresponsible-journalism.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226202006/http://www.technovia.co.uk/2009/02/techcrunch-irresponsible-journalism.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 February 2009 |title=TechCrunch: Irresponsible journalism |publisher=Technovia.co.uk |date=23 February 2009 |accessdate=27 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Macalope |first=The |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1168107/macalope_pointless_exercises.html |title=The Macalope Weekly: Pointless Exercises |publisher=Macworld |date=2012-08-11 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the principle is much older. As with similar "laws" (e.g., [[Murphy's law]]), it is intended to be humorous rather than the literal truth.&lt;ref&gt;Gooden, Philip (2010). Skyscrapers, Hemlines and the Eddie Murphy Rule (1st ed.), Ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The maxim has been cited by other names since as early as 1991, when a published compilation of Murphy's Law variants called it "'''Davis's law'''",&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Arthur. The Complete Murphy's Law: A Definitive Collection. Rev. ed. Los Angeles, Calif.: Price Stern Sloan, 1991.

== History ==

Ian Betteridge's name became associated with the concept after he discussed it in a February 2009 article, which examined a previous [[TechCrunch]] article that carried the headline "Did [[Last.fm]] Just Hand Over User Listening Data to the [[RIAA]]?":&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/20/did-lastfm-just-hand-over-user-listening-data-to-the-riaa/ "Did Last.fm Just Hand Over User Listening Data To the RIAA?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This story is a great demonstration of my maxim that any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word "no." The reason why journalists use that style of headline is that they know the story is probably bullshit, and don’t actually have the sources and facts to back it up, but still want to run it.&lt;ref name="betteridge2009" /&gt;}}

A similar observation was made by British newspaper editor [[Andrew Marr]] in his 2004 book ''My Trade'', among Marr's suggestions for how a reader should interpret newspaper articles:

{{quote|If the headline asks a question, try answering 'no'. Is This the True Face of Britain's Young? (Sensible reader: No.) Have We Found the Cure for AIDS? (No; or you wouldn't have put the question mark in.) Does This Map Provide the Key for Peace? (Probably not.) A headline with a question mark at the end means, in the vast majority of cases, that the story is tendentious or over-sold. It is often a scare story, or an attempt to elevate some run-of-the-mill piece of reporting into a national controversy and, preferably, a national panic. To a busy journalist hunting for real information a question mark means 'don't bother reading this bit'.&lt;ref name="My Trade"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marr |first=Andrew |title=My Trade: a short history of British journalism |year=2004 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |isbn=978-1-4050-0536-4 |page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the field of [[particle physics]], the concept is known as '''Hinchliffe's Rule''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2006/12/07/guest-blogger-joe-polchinski-on-the-string-debates|title = Guest Blogger: Joe Polchinski on the String Debates|date = 7 December 2006|accessdate = 16 May 2014|website = Cosmic Variance|publisher = Discover Magazine|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peon"/&gt; after physicist [[Ian Hinchliffe]],&lt;ref name="improb"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume21/v21i3/Consistent-with-Hinchliffe-21-3.pdf |first=Stuart M. |last=Shieber |title=Is This Article Consistent with Hinchliffe's Rule? |journal=Annals of Improbable Research |date=May–June 2015 |volume=21 |number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; who stated that if a research paper's title is in the form of a yes–no question, the answer to that question will be "no".&lt;ref name="improb"/&gt; The adage led into a humorous attempt at a [[Liar paradox|liar's paradox]] by a pseudonymous 1988 paper which bore the title "Is Hinchliffe’s Rule True?"&lt;ref name="peon"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Peon|first=Boris|url = http://ccdb5fs.kek.jp/cgi-bin/img/allpdf?199007095|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160410022155/http://ccdb5fs.kek.jp/cgi-bin/img/allpdf?199007095|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 10 April 2016|title = Is Hinchliffe's Rule True?|date = 4 August 1988|accessdate = 21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="improb"/&gt;

However, at least one article found that the "law" does not apply in research literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=James M.|last2=Plourde|first2=Dawn|date=2016-06-25|title=Do scholars follow Betteridge's Law?

The '''Bryn Gwyn stones''' stand about {{convert|280|metres}} to the south-west of [[Castell Bryn Gwyn]], on the low ridge some {{cvt|2|metres|ft|0}} above the valley of the [[Afon Braint]] on the [[Isle of Anglesey]] in [[Wales]].&lt;ref name="Cope1998"&gt;{{cite book |first=Julian |last= Cope |authorlink= Julian Cope |title= [[The Modern Antiquarian: A Pre-millennial Odyssey Through Megalithic Britain]] : Including a Gazetteer to Over 300 Prehistoric Sites |year=1998 |page=307 |publisher= Thorsons Pub |isbn= 978-0-7225-3599-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are the tallest [[standing stone]]s in Wales, nearly {{cvt|4|metres|ft|disp=x| high (|)}}. In 1723 [[Henry Rowlands]] described them as part of a ruinous circle of eight stones, some {{cvt|16|metres}} across. An account of 1797 says that "ignorant country people supposing money was hid under them tore them up" and today only two stones, one slab and one pillar, stand in a modern field bank. Nothing else is visible on the ground, but a 2008 excavation found three pits of standing stones, two containing stone stumps,&lt;ref&gt;BRYN GWYN STONES, BRYNSIENCYN, ANGLESEY EVALUATION EXCAVATION 2008 PRELIMINARY REPORT.

The pit of a further stone, inside the circle, shows it was a 'blade-style' stone, with an alignment with the summer solstice sunrise and winter solstice sunset.&lt;ref name=excavation/&gt; A public footpath runs past the stones from Bryngwyn-mawr on the [[A4080 road]], continuing north-east on a low ridge past [[Castell Bryn Gwyn]] and some 800 metres further to [[Caer Lêb]].

In the 18th century a cottage was built with the wide stone as its end wall. Notches round its top show where roof timbers had been fitted. With the removal of the cottage (which had occupied an area inside the stone circle)&lt;ref name=excavation/&gt; the stones were used as a gateway through the field hedge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Watprn|coflein|302402}}, Coflein site database of [[RCAHMW]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Further to the north-east at Tre'r Dryw Bach, another large [[stone circle]] was reported by 18th century visitors but has since been cleared away.&lt;ref name="Cyfeillion Ymddiriedolaeth Archaeolegol Gwynedd 2009. pp 32-33" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1903">'''Cacography''' is deliberate comic [[misspelling]], a type of [[humour]] similar to [[malapropism]].&lt;ref&gt;"On the Real Side: Laughing, Lying, and Signifying: the Underground Tradition of African-American Humor that Transformed American Culture, from [[Slavery]] to [[Richard Pryor]]", by [[Mel Watkins]], 1994, {{ISBN|0-671-68982-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BrNZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=cacography&amp;dq=cacography&amp;lr=&amp;pgis=1 pp. 60, 62]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pattee&gt;"A History of American Literature Since 1870" by Fred Lewis Pattee, 1917, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gs5ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%22deliberate+misspelling%22 p.34], digitized by Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

The term in the sense of "poor [[spelling]], [[diacritic|accentuation]], and [[punctuation]]" is a semantic [[antonym]] to [[orthography]],&lt;ref&gt;"A Practical Grammar of French Rhetoric, by Gabriel Surenne", 1846, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pTQEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=cacography#PPA150,M1p. 150], digitized by [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the sense of "poor [[handwriting]]" it is an etymological antonym to the word [[calligraphy]]: cacography is from [[Greek language|Greek]] κακός (''kakos'' "bad") and γραφή (''graphe'' "writing").

A common usage of cacography is to [[caricature]] illiterate speakers.&lt;ref&gt;"The literary content of the New York Spirit of the times, 1831-1856", by [[Richard Boyd Hauck]]", 1965, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uws_AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=cacography&amp;dq=cacography&amp;lr=&amp;pgis=1 p. 184]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The Center for Latin American Studies states that its mission is to "expand and enrich academic resources relating to Latin America and the Caribbean at the University of Pittsburgh".&lt;ref name="about us"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/clas/about.html | title=Center for Latin American Studies: About Us | publisher=University of Pittsburgh Center for International Studies | date=2011-09-06 | accessdate=2011-10-29 | archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710015652/http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/clas/about.html# | archive-date=2009-07-10 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It assists students in gaining expertise in Latin American and Caribbean affairs, and encourages the faculty to "pursue research, enhance their expertise, and disseminate new knowledge on the region".  CLAS shares its resources with academic local, national, and international academic communities, public and private sector organizations, as well as the general public.&lt;ref name="about us"/&gt;

==Location==
[[File:University of Pittsburgh (looking South-West) seen from the Cathedral of Learning With Numbered Callouts May 14, 2010.jpg|thumb|The  [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood of Pittsburgh]]
CLAS is located on the University of Pittsburgh's main campus in the city’s  [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood. CLAS’s offices are found in the Center for International Studies on the 4th floor of [[Wesley W. Posvar Hall|Welsey Posvar Hall]], Pitt’s largest academic building. Posvar Hall stands along Schenley Drive between Forbes Avenue and Roberto Clemente Drive. The Center is located on the former site of [[Forbes Field]] where the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] played from 1909 to 1970 and won multiple [[World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tour.pitt.edu/tour-040.html | title=Virtual Tour: Wesley Posvar Hall | publisher=University of Pittsburgh | accessdate=2011-10-29 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003101638/http://www.tour.pitt.edu/tour-040.html | archivedate=2011-10-03 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Posvar Hall (WWPH) - evening Fall 2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[Posvar Hall]] is the primary location of CLAS]]
The Center was formally founded on September 16, 1964 during Chancellor [[Edward H. Litchfield]]’s tenure at the University.&lt;ref&gt;"The Story of a Center: 1964–2004, Latin America Invades Pittsburgh" by Cole Blaiser (Director of CLAS 1964–1974), part of the CLAS Latin American Monograph &amp; Document Series&lt;/ref&gt;  Realizing the globalizing effect of World War II and witnessing the city of Pittsburgh’s role in global affairs, the Pitt administration became dedicated to transitioning from a University serving primarily Pennsylvania to one with a more global impact. Litchfield’s goal for the Center was to strengthen the University’s “International Dimension,” particularly with regard to Latin America. Litchfield cited Latin America’s “important economic, social and political ties with the United States” in advocating for the establishment of a Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?xc=1;g=documentingpitt;xg=1;type=simple;didno=31735062134469;idno=31735062134469;view=image;seq=0005 | title=The Wide World of Pitt | first=Esther | last=Kitzes | journal=Pitt | page=3 | volume=19 | number=4 | publisher=University of Pittsburgh | location=Pittsburgh, PA | date=Fall 1964 | accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a five-year, $1.5 million grant from the [[Ford Foundation]] awarded in 1964, Litchfield hired political scientist Cole Blasier to direct the founding of the Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R2EqAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5318%2C5509265 | title=Pitt Rising As Latin Study Center | first=Kenneth | last=Eskey | newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press | date=1967-10-29 | accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Blasier worked in conjunction with the University’s history, political science and sociology departments to form CLAS. The original coalition of these three distinct departments provided the lasting example of interdisciplinary cooperation that defines the Center today. Each semester, over 120 Pitt professors in over 20 different departments teach more than 250 courses on Latin America and the Caribbean.
	
Economist Carmelo Mesa-Lago became the Center's second director in 1977,&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Latinos"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/magazine/19991003latinos1.asp | title=Pittsburgh's 'invisible' Latinos are emerging as part of a national population explosion | first=Diana Nelson | last=Jones | newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | location=Pittsburgh, PA | date=1999-10-03 | accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and while under his direction CLAS was officially designated a [[National Resource Center|National Resource Center in Latin American Studies]] in 1979. The designation provided further funding and national recognition for CLAS.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Latin American Studies (CLAS) Website – http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/clas/publications&lt;/ref&gt;  CLAS has been continuously funded by the US Department of Education as a National Resource Center since 1979. Following Mesa-Lago,other directors were Mitchell Seligson, William Dewalt, Kathleen Musante, Scott Morgenstern.

[[File:Eduardo lozano.jpg|thumb|Eduardo Lozano, founder and director of the Latin American Library Collection]]
[[File:LatinroomHillman.jpg|thumb|The Collection's Latin American Reading Room in [[Hillman Library]]]]
The collection was created and primarily built by Eduardo Lozano, a librarian, artist, poet, and author from [[Argentina]] who directed the Latin American Library from its creation until his death in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06239/716726-122.stm | title=Obituary: Eduardo F.

More than 85% of the volumes are in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and the collection’s resources on [[Bolivia]] and [[Cuba]] are considered some of the world’s best.&lt;ref name="libraryreview"/&gt; Over 400 libraries, research centers, universities, and governmental departments based in various locations around the world maintain exchange agreements with the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.pitt.edu/libraries/latam/latam.html |title=Eduardo Lozano Latin American Collection |publisher=University Library System, University of Pittsburgh |accessdate=2011-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112065033/http://www.library.pitt.edu/libraries/latam/latam.html |archivedate=2011-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, a Latin American inspired reading room, housing a portion of the Lozano Collection, was dedicated in the university's [[Hillman Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?cc=pittpressreleases;idno=pittpressreleases20020147;view=image;seq=0001 | title=New Latin American Reading Room to be Dedicated Sept. 25 in Pitt's Hillman Library | publisher=University of Pittsburgh | date=2002-09-23 | accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composed of arches and columns with windows on three sides, the room was designed by [[Peruvian]]-American architect Victor Beltran to be reminiscent of a Spanish courtyard.&lt;ref name="roomdedication"/&gt;

==Undergraduate and graduate programs==
Since 1968, CLAS has offered undergraduate students a program in Latin American studies. Students work towards receiving a certificate in Latin American studies in conjunction with their bachelor's degree. Graduates of the program therefore obtain interdisciplinary knowledge and field study in the Latin American region.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/clas/students/study.html | title=CLAS: Programs of Study | publisher=University of Pittsburgh Center for International Studies | date=2011-08-31 | accessdate=2011-10-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041027114329/http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/clas/students/study.html# | archive-date=2004-10-27 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These graduates have become administrators in the [[United Nations]], state and federal government officials, [[Peace Corps]] and Catholic relief service volunteers, foreign service officers in Argentina, [[Brazil]], and other countries, Spanish teachers, and many other professionals in a variety of fields.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The graduate program at CLAS is aimed at doctoral or master's students who want to incorporate a specialization in Latin America into their studies. Candidates for the graduate certificate must be proficient in Spanish, Portuguese, or an Amerindian language. Currently, four semesters of [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] are offered to fulfill the Amerindian language requirement. Two courses in the student’s major department and four courses in at least two departments outside are required for completion of the program, as is an interdisciplinary research paper in the field of Latin American studies.&lt;ref name="study"/&gt;

==CLAS educational and public service outreach==
As a National Resource Center on Latin America, the Outreach Program at CLAS plays a leading role in sharing information and resources on Latin American studies to educators of all academic levels and disciplines. CLAS' Outreach Program offers educational expertise from college level educators to [[kindergarten]] through [[Secondary education in the United States|secondary]] classes. In addition, CLAS seeks to provide resources to the professional community and the general public as part of its educational public service outreach mission. Outreach programs are offered throughout the academic year and include professional development workshops, study abroad opportunities, faculty development seminars, summer research fellowships, curriculum development projects, school visit programs, a resource lending library, and lecture and film series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/clas/outreach.html | title=Educational Public Service (Outreach) | publisher=University of Pittsburgh Center for International Studies | date=2011-08-31 | accessdate=2011-10-29 | archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710015810/http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/clas/outreach.html# | archive-date=2009-07-10 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The center also published two in-house newsletters, ''CLASicos'' and ''Las Noticias'', and in concert with the [[University of Pittsburgh Press]], its faculty and staff are often involved in helping to produce scholarly publications and journals covering a range of Latin American topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/clas/publications.html | title=Publications on the Latin American and Caribbean Region at the University of Pittsburgh | publisher=University of Pittsburgh Center for International Studies | date=2011-10-07 | accessdate=2011-10-29 | archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710015030/http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/clas/publications.html# | archive-date=2009-07-10 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the center also hosts the website ''Panoramas'' which provides an on-line venue for a dialogue and academic discussion of Latin American and Caribbean issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panoramas.pitt.edu/about|title=Panoramas: About|publisher=Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=N08NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3370%2C141670 | title=Nadie es Profeta... | newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | location=Pittsburgh, PA | date=1980-02-02 | accessdate=2011-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; CLAS has also hosted an annual Latin American and Caribbean Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_158419.html | title=Fest highlights Hispanic flavor | first=Erik | last=Siemers | newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review | date=2003-10-05 | accessdate=2011-10-29 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.pointparkglobe.com/features/festival-unites-latin-american-caribbean-communities-with-art-1.2120655#.TquuuGAzDC8 | title=Festival unites Latin American, Caribbean communities with art | first=Emily | last=Petsko | newspaper=The Globe | location=Pittsburgh, PA | date=2011-03-23 | accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Charles Alfred Bell''', [[Order of the Indian Empire|KCIE]] [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]] (October 31, 1870 – March 8, 1945) was the British Political Officer for [[Bhutan]], [[Sikkim]] and [[Tibet]]. He was known as "British India's ambassador to Tibet" before retiring and becoming a noted [[tibetologist]].

== Biography ==
He was educated at Winchester School and then at New College, Oxford, after which he joined the [[Indian Civil Service]] in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor1-first=Paul | editor1-last=Dimeo| editor2-first=James | editor2-last=Mills| title =Soccer in South Asia: Empire, Nation, Diaspora| chapter= 'Kicking the Buddha's Head': India, Tibet and Footballing Colonialism| chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=O2RFRH0zSZ4C&amp;pg=PA89&amp;hl=fr&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| author=Alex McKay| page=91| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liverpool" /&gt;

In 1908, he was appointed Political Officer in [[Sikkim]]. He soon became very influential in [[Sikkim#Government and politics|Sikkimese]] and [[Bhutanese politics]], and in 1910 he met the [[13th Dalai Lama]], who had been forced into temporary exile by the Chinese. He got to know him quite well, and later wrote his biography (''Portrait of the Dalai Lama'', published in 1946).

In 1913 he participated in the [[Simla Convention]], a treaty between Great Britain, China and Tibet concerning the status of Tibet. Before the summit, he met in [[Gyantse]] with [[Paljor Dorje Shatra]], the Tibetan representative to the [[British Raj]] at [[Darjeeling]] and advised him to bring to [[Shimla|Simla]] with him all documents concerning relations between [[Tibetan sovereignty debate|China and Tibet]], as well as Tibetan claims to land occupied by China. Bell was designated to assist the Tibetans in the negotiations, with Archibald Rose assigned to be his counterpart for the Chinese. He was appointed a [[Order of St Michael and St George|Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG)]] in the [[1915 New Year Honours]] for his services.

In 1919 he resigned as Britain's political officer in Sikkim to devote himself full-time to his research. However, London sent him to [[Lhasa]] in 1920 as a special ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| author=Michael and Barbara Foster|title=Forbidden Journey: the life of [[Alexandra David-Neel]] | publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1987 |ISBN= 9780062503459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After travelling through Tibet and visiting [[Lhasa]] in 1920, he retired to [[Oxford]], where he wrote a series of books on the history, culture and religion of Tibet. He was awarded a knighthood for his Lhasa Mission in 1922.&lt;ref name="Liverpool" /&gt;

Palhese, Bell's Tibetan friend and confidant travelled to England in 1927-28 to assist him in editing several of these books.&lt;ref name="Liverpool"&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/collections/item.aspx?tab=people&amp;item=50.31.132&amp;coll=1&amp;mat=35&amp;page=1&amp;expand=51034 Portrait of Sir Charles Bell CMG KCIE], National Museums Liverpool.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the photographs that he took in Tibet can be found in the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]] in Oxford. Some of these were included in the 1997 book ''Tibet: Caught in Time''.

His English-Tibetan colloquial dictionary was first published in 1905 together with a grammar of colloquial Tibetan as ''Manual of Colloquial Tibetan''.

[[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]] mentions Bell in the introduction to the book ''[[Seven Years in Tibet]]'' by [[Heinrich Harrer]], Flamingo imprint 1997, specifically his surprisingly close relationship to the 13th Dalai Lama even though he was a foreigner.

In most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, a '''conveyancer''' is a specialist [[lawyer]] who specialises in the [[legal]] aspects of [[buying]] and [[selling]] [[real property]], or [[conveyancing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.constitution.org/bouv/bouvier_c.htm | title=Bouvier's Law Dictionary | publisher=Constitution Society | date=1856 | accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conveyancer can also be (but need not be) a [[solicitor]], [[licensed conveyancer]], or a [[fellow]] of the [[Institute of Legal Executives]].

In the United Kingdom, conveyancers are regulated by an official body known as the Council for Licensed Conveyancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conveyancer.org.uk/|title=CLC – The Specialist Property Law Regulator|website=www.conveyancer.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main purpose is to set entry standards and regulate the profession of licensed conveyancers effectively in order to secure adequate consumer protection, promote effective competition in the legal services market and provide choice for consumers. 

Services offered by conveyancers vary from Residential Conveyancing, [[Probate]] and [[Will (law)|Wills]]. Strong regulation is imposed to curb unfair practices which include among others false representation, exaction for hidden charges and double dealing. 

In Kenya, a conveyancer can only be an admitted advocate holding a valid current practising certificate. The consequences of not holding such a certificate is fatal to any transaction he undertakes on behalf of his client, and will be void. The client is therefore under obligation to do his due diligence by ensuring that his conveyancer has a current valid practising certificate by confirming this with the law society of Kenya. This was authoritatively decided by the [[Court of Appeal of Kenya|Court of Appeal]] in its decision of National Bank of Kenya Ltd. v. Wilson Ndolo Ayah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kenyalaw.org/Downloads_FreeCases/70186.pdf | title=Civil Appeal 119 of 2002 | publisher=Kenya Law Reports | date=2009 | accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, a conveyancer is also known as a Settlement Agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legalelements.com.au/conveyancing-brisbane/purchasing-a-house/how-do-conveyancers-operate-and-can-they-help/ | title=How Do Conveyancers Operate And Can They Help?| publisher=The Legal Elements | date=22 January 2014 | accessdate=30 January 2015 | author=Foyle, Brendon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, a conveyancer is a legal clerk or a paralegal who assist lawyers in all aspects of conveying real estate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4437">In [[comedy]], a '''dick joke''', '''penis joke''', '''balls joke''', '''cock joke''' or a '''knob joke''' is a joke that makes a direct or indirect reference to a human [[penis]] (known in slang parlance as a [[dick (slang)|dick]]), also used as an umbrella term for dirty jokes. The famous quote from [[Mae West]], "Is that a gun in your pocket or are you just excited to see me?" is cited as an example of a penis joke. The "dick joke" has been described as "often used as a metaphor for the male-defined nature of stand-up comedy".&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;Joanne R. Gilbert, ''Performing Marginality: Humor, Gender, and Cultural Critique'' (2004), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Dick jokes have also been noted to be both popular and effective with audiences:

{{quote|Comics use what "works," and dick jokes are guaranteed to amuse audiences of both genders in a surprising variety of contexts. Simply put, dick jokes get the quickest and biggest laughs, and in stand-up comedy, size does matter.&lt;ref name="Gilbert"/&gt;}}

==In comedy==
An important component of a dick joke is breaking a social taboo. As a Canadian comedian [[Ricky Blue]] puts it: "The trick is being able to speak the unspeakable and somehow get away with it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomifobia.com/ricky_blue/dick_joke.shtml|title=The world loves a good Dick joke|work=Log Cabin Chronicles|author=Ricky Blue|accessdate=2005-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian [[Bill Hicks]] satirized the popularity of dick jokes in his own act:

{{quote|He hasn't told any dick jokes. Doesn't he know he's in America? Doesn't he know about our puritanical self hatred of our own body and its desires, the only way we can find relief is through the medium of penis material?' Yeah, I'm totally aware of where I am, don't worry. The dick jokes are on their way.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Hicks, ''Love All the People'' (2009), "Appendix: Recorded Live in Denver, San Ramon, West Palm Beach and San Francisco (1990-93)".&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, due to their prurient nature, comedians who rely on explicit humor must find less controversial subject matter if they wish to expand their presence to more restrictive venues like [[network television]] and [[family film]]s. In short, "young professionals whose success has been achieved on the stepladder of dick jokes must eventually change their acts".&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Stebbins, ''Laugh-Makers: Stand-Up Comedy as Art, Business, and Life-Style'' (1990), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of this kind of joke, as with most humor, may rest with the unspoken connotation.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} An example is the joke below set in a class in medical school:

{{quote|A professor gives his psychology class a spot quiz. One question he asks is, "What part of the human anatomy may expand up to ten times under certain circumstances?" He picks a rather overdressed girl in the front row to answer it. "Miss Callahan!" The indicated girl, who heard the question, stammers with some embarrassment: "Professor, I'd rather not answer that question." The professor says, "That's all right, Miss Callahan, you don't need to answer it. Is there anyone present who can answer it?" He notes an interested face in the back of the classroom. "Mr. Hawkins!" Hawkins says, "Yes, Professor, it is the pupil of the eye that may expand to ten times." The professor says, "That is correct, Mr. Hawkins." Then he turns to Miss Callahan. He says, "Young lady, two things are obvious from your reaction to this question. One, you haven't studied this week's assignment; and Two, I'm afraid marriage is going to be a tremendous disappointment to you."}}

Because the name [[Richard]] can be abbreviated as "Dick", in some jokes a person named "Richard" or "Dick" is presented as a [[double entendre]].&lt;ref&gt;Joel Stice, "[http://www.collegehumor.com/post/6986076/10-dicks-who-made-it-onto-the-local-news 10 Dicks Who Made it Onto the Local News]", ''[[CollegeHumor.com]]'' (August 15, 2014): "There's nothing wrong with the name "Dick" but when your name is literally a dick joke, maybe think about going by Richard".&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Governance}}
{{POV|date=October 2015}}
{{Politics sidebar |expanded=none}}
'''Electronic governance''' or '''e-governance''' is the applicati of [[information and communication technology]] (ICT) for delivering [[government services]], exchange of information, communication transactions, integration of various stand-alone systems and services between government-to-citizen (G2C), government-to-business (G2B), government-to-government (G2G), government-to-employees (G2E) as well as [[back office|back-office]] processes and interactions within the entire government framework.&lt;ref name="Saugat, Masud"&gt;Saugata, B., and Masud, R.R. (2007). ''Implementing E-Governance Using OECD Model(Modified) and Gartner Model (Modified) Upon Agriculture of Bangladesh''. IEEE. 1-4244-1551-9/07.&lt;/ref&gt; Through e-governance, government services are made available to citizens in a convenient, efficient, and transparent manner. The three main target groups that can be distinguished in governance concepts are government, citizens, and
businesses/interest groups. In e-governance, there are no distinct boundaries.&lt;ref name=Garson&gt;Garson, D.G. (2006). ''Public Information Technology and E-Governance''. Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinction from e-government ==
{{Main|E-government}}

Although the two terms are often used interchangeably, there is a difference between e-governance and e-government. E-government refers to the use of the ICTs in public administration which, when combined with organizational change and new skills, are intended to improve [[public services]] and democratic processes and to strengthen support to the public. However, e-government has no provision for governance of ICTs. The governance of ICTs typically requires a substantial increase in regulation and [[Policy making|policy-making]]  capabilities, as well as additional expertise and opinion-shaping processes among various social stakeholders. The perspective of e-governance is "the use of the technologies that both help to govern and have to be governed".&lt;ref&gt;Rossel, Pierre, and Matthias Finger. "Conceptualizing e-Governance." Management (2007) : 399–407.&lt;/ref&gt; The central goal of e-governance is to reach the [[beneficiary]] and to ensure that their service needs are met. Ideally, the government will automatically recognize the importance of achieving this goal in order to maximize its efficiency.

Furthermore, e-government uses one-way [[communication protocol]] whereas e-governance uses two-way communication protocol. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Establishing the identity of the end [[beneficiary]] is a challenge in all citizen-centric services. Statistical information published by governments and global bodies do not always reveal the facts. The best form of e-governance cuts down on the unwanted interference of too many layers while delivering governmental services. It depends on good infrastructural setup with the support of local processes and parameters for governments to reach their citizens or end beneficiaries. A [[budget]] for planning, development, and growth can be derived from well laid out e-governance systems.

The relevance of BI Analytics has brought forth a paradigm shift in assimilating and visualizing huge chunks of data in near real-time manner. The pivot of all good decision-making systems is correct, up-to-date and compliant data. Governments not only want the transformation of their own country and countrymen but also expect improved relations and healthy trade across the world. Development should be transformative and continuously evolving. Internal as well as external IT systems should work in tandem with government policies and procedures. Data Analytics has the ability to change the color and complexion of the world. E-governance should induce up-to-date information, initiate effective interaction, and engage with transparent transactions in compliance with rule of law, thus enabling a sustainable transformation model.

The [[public–private partnership]] (PPP)-based e-governance projects are hugely successful in [[India]]. Many countries implement e-government policy in an attempt to build a [[Corruption (political)|corruption]]-free government.

== Government to citizen ==
The goal of government-to-citizen (G2C) e-governance is to offer a variety of ICT services to citizens in an efficient and economical manner and to strengthen the relationship between government and citizens using technology.

There are several methods of government-to-customer e-governance. [[Two-way communication]] allows citizens to instant message directly with public administrators, and cast remote electronic votes ([[electronic voting]]) and instant opinion voting. Transactions such as payment of services, such as city utilities, can be completed online or over the phone. Mundane services such as name or address changes, applying for services or grants, or transferring existing services are more convenient and no longer have to be completed face to face.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Miller, W &amp; Walling, J, (2013). "Government in the twenty-first century: New Avenues of Study". Taking Sides. New York, NY: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

===By country===
G2C e-governance is unbalanced across the globe as not everyone has Internet access and computing skills, but the [[United States]], [[European Union]], and [[Asia]] are ranked the top three in development.

The [[Federal Government of the United States]] has a broad framework of G2C technology to enhance citizen access to Government information and services. [[Benefits.Gov|benefits.gov]] is an official US government website that informs citizens of benefits they are eligible for and provides information on how to apply for assistance. US State Governments also engage in G2C interaction through the [[Department of Transportation]], [[Department of Public Safety]], [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]], [[United States Department of Education]], and others.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;Lee, (2004). "Communications of the ACM". Association for Computing Machinery.&lt;/ref&gt; As with e-governance on the global level, G2C services vary from state to state. The Digital States Survey ranks states on social measures, [[digital democracy]], [[e-commerce]], taxation, and revenue. The 2012 report shows [[Michigan]] and [[Utah]] in the lead and [[Florida]] and [[Idaho]] with the lowest scores.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; Municipal governments in the United States also use government-to-customer technology to complete transactions and inform the public. Much like states, cities are awarded for innovative technology. Government Technology's "Best of the Web 2012" named Louisville, KY, Arvada, CO, Raleigh, NC, Riverside, CA, and Austin, TX the top five G2C city portals.&lt;ref name=Best&gt;Best of the Web, (2012). Government Technologies. http://www.govtech.com/e-government/2012-Best-of-the-Web-Award-Winners-Announced.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

European countries were ranked second among all geographic regions. The Single Point of Access for Citizens of Europe supports travel within Europe and Europe is a 1999 initiative supporting an online government. Main focuses are to provide public information, allow customers to have access to basic [[public service]]s, simplify online procedures, and promote [[electronic signature]]s.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;  [[Estonia]] is the first and the only country&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20171019-could-estonia-be-the-first-digital-country|title=Could Estonia be the first ‘digital’ country?|last=Lufkin|first=Bryan|language=en|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the world with e-residency&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=e-Residency of Estonia|date=2018-10-29|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=E-Residency_of_Estonia&amp;oldid=866269903|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which enables anyone in the world outside Estonia to  access Estonian online services. 

Asia is ranked third in comparison, and there are diverse G2C programs between countries. [[Singapore]]'s eCitizen Portal is an organized single access point to government information and services. [[South Korea]]'s Home Tax Service (HTS) provides citizens with 24/7 online services such as tax declaration. [[Taiwan]] has top ranking G2C technology including an online motor vehicle services system, which provides 21 applications and payment services to citizens.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;

Government-to-Citizen is the communication link between a government and private individuals or residents. Such G2C communication most often refers to that which takes place through [[Information and Communication Technologies]] (ICTs), but can also include [[direct mail]] and media campaigns. G2C can take place at the federal, state, and local levels. 
G2C stands in contrast to G2B, or [[Government-to-business|Government-to-Business]] networks.

One such Federal G2C network is [[USA.gov]], the United States' official web portal, though there are many other examples from governments around the world.&lt;ref&gt;White, Jay D. (2007) Managing Information in the Public Sector. M.E. Sharpe. New York&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concerns ===
A full switch to government-to-citizen e-governance will cost a large amount of money in development and implementation.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; In addition, government agencies do not always engage citizens in the development of their e-gov services or accept feedback. Customers identified the following barriers to government-to-customer e-governance: not everyone has Internet access, especially in rural or low-income areas, G2C technology can be problematic for citizens who lack computing skills. Some G2C sites have technology requirements (such as browser requirements and plug-ins) that won't allow access to certain services, language barriers, the necessity for an e-mail address to access certain services, and a lack of privacy.&lt;ref name=Bertot&gt;Bertot, Jaegar, and McClure, (2008).

==Government to employees==
{{redirect|G2E|gaming trade show|Global Gaming Expo}}
E-governance to Employee partnership (G2E) Is one of four main primary interactions in the delivery model of E-governance. It is the relationship between online tools, sources, and articles that help employees maintain communication with the government and their own companies. E-governance relationship with Employees allows new learning technology in one simple place as the computer. Documents can now be stored and shared with other colleagues online.&lt;ref name=Fang&gt;Fang, Zhiyuan. "E-government in Digital Era: Concept, Development, and Practice." International Journal of the Computer 10.2 (2002): 1-22. Web. 2 Apr. 2014.http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.133.9080&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
E-governance makes it possible for employees to become paperless and makes it easy for employees to send important documents back and forth to colleagues all over the world instead of having to print out these records or fax&lt;ref name=carter&gt;Carter, Lemuria, and France Belanger. "Citizen Adoption of Electronic Government Initiatives". IEEE Xplore. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Government-to-employees|G2E]] services also include software for maintaining personal information and records of employees. Some of the benefits of G2E expansion include:

* E-payroll – maintaining the online sources to view paychecks, pay stubs, pay bills, and keep records for tax information.
* E-benefits – be able to look up what benefits an employee is receiving and what benefits they have a right to.
* [[E-learning|E-training]] – allows for new and current employees to regularly maintain the training they have through the development of new technology and to allow new employees to train and learn over new materials in one convenient location. E-learning is another way to keep employees informed on the important materials they need to know through the use of visuals, animation, videos, etc. It is usually a computer-based learning tool, although not always. It is also a way for employees to learn at their own pace ([[distance learning]]), although it can be instructor-led.
* Maintaining records of personal information – Allows the system to keep all records in one easy location to update with every single bit of information that is relevant to a personal file. Examples being social security numbers, tax information, current address, and other information&lt;ref name=Dawes&gt;Dawes, Sharon S. "The Evolution and Continuing Challenges of E-Governance." - Dawes. Wiley Online Library, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

Government-to-employees (abbreviated G2E) is the online interactions through instantaneous communication tools between [[Government-owned corporation|government units]] and their employees. G2E is one out of the four primary delivery models of [[e-Government]].&lt;ref name="G2E"&gt;{{cite web|citeseerx = 10.1.1.127.9483|title=E-Government for Developing Countries:Opportunities and Challenges|publisher=The Electronic Journal on Information Systems in Developing Countries (EJISDC)|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="India"&gt;{{cite news|first=B.S.|last=Raghavan|title=E-the-people|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2001/08/10/stories/041039of.htm|location=India| agency=[[The Hindu Group]] |newspaper=[[Business Line]]|date=10 August 2001|accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=On demand government|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2001/08/10/stories/041039of.htm|location=London|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=18 November 2003|accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government to government ==

===E-government===
From the start of 1990s e-commerce and e-product, there has rampant integration of e-forms of government process. Governments have now tried to use the efficiencies of their techniques to cut down on waste. E-government is a fairly broad subject matter, but all relate to how the services and representation are now delivered and how they are now being implemented.

Many governments around the world have gradually turned to Information technologies (IT) in an effort to keep up with today's demands. Historically, many governments in this sphere have only been reactive, but recently there has been a more proactive approach in developing comparable services such things as [[e-commerce]] and [[e-business]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1936-4490.2003.tb00306.x|title=E-Government and E-Governance: The Future Isn't What It Used to Be|journal=Canadian Journal of Administrative Sciences / Revue Canadienne des Sciences de l'Administration|volume=20|pages=74|year=2009|last1=Marche|first1=Sunny|last2=McNiven|first2=James D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before, the structure emulated private-like business techniques. Recently that has all changed as e-government begins to make its own plan. Not only does e-government introduce a new form of record keeping, but it also continues to become more interactive to better the process of delivering services and promoting constituency participation.

The framework of such an organization is now expected to increase more than ever by becoming efficient and reducing the time it takes to complete an objective. Some examples include paying utilities, tickets, and applying for permits. So far, the biggest concern is accessibility to Internet technologies for the average citizen. In an effort to help, administrations are now trying to aid those who do not have the skills to fully participate in this new medium of governance, especially now as e-government progressing to more e-governance terms.

An overhaul of the structure is now required as every pre-existing sub-entity must now merge under one concept of e-government. As a result, Public Policy has also seen changes due to the emerging of constituent participation and the Internet. Many governments such as Canada's have begun to invest in developing new mediums of communication of issues and information through virtual communication and participation. In practice, this has led to several responses and adaptations by interest groups, activist, and lobbying groups. This new medium has changed the way the polis interacts with government.

===Editorial===
The purpose to include e-governance to government is to means more efficient in various aspects. Whether it means to reduce cost by reducing paper clutter, staffing cost, or communicating with private citizens or public government. E-government brings many advantages to play such as facilitating information delivery, application process/renewal between both business and private citizen, and participation with the constituency. There are both internal and external advantages to the emergence of IT in government, though not all municipalities are alike in size and participation.
 
In theory, there are currently 4 major levels of E-government in municipal governments:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/0033-3352.00196|title=The Evolution of E-Government among Municipalities: Rhetoric or Reality?|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=62|issue=4|pages=424|year=2002|last1=Moon|first1=M. Jae}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The establishment of a secure and cooperative interaction among governmental agencies
*Web-based service delivery
*The application of e-commerce for more efficient government transactions activities
* Digital democracy
These, along with 5 degrees of technical integration and interaction of users include: 
*Simple information dissemination (one-way communication)
* Two-way communication (request and response)
*Service and financial transactions
*Integration (horizontal and vertical integration)
*Political participation

The adoption of e-government in municipalities evokes greater innovation in e-governance by being specialized and localized. The level success and feedback depends greatly on the city size and government type. A [[council-manager government]] municipality typically works the best with this method, as opposed to [[mayor-council government]] positions, which tend to be more political. Therefore, they have greater barriers towards its application. Council-Manager governments are also more inclined to be effective here by bringing innovation and reinvention of governance to e-governance.

The International City/County Management Association and Public Technology Inc. have done surveys over the effectiveness of this method. The results are indicating that most governments are still in either the primary stages (1 or stage 2), which revolves around public service requests. Though application of integration is now accelerating, there has been little to no instigating research to see its progression as e-governance to the government. We can only theorize it's still within the primitive stages of e-governance.

===Overview===
Government-to-Government (abbreviated G2G) is the online non-commercial interaction between Government organizations, departments, and authorities and other Government organizations, departments, and authorities. Its use is common in the [[UK]], along with [[G2C]], the online non-commercial interaction of local and central Government and private individuals, and [[Government-to-business|G2B]] the online non-commercial interaction of local and central Government and the commercial business sector.

G2G systems generally come in one of two types: Internal-facing - joining up a single Governments departments, agencies, organizations, and authorities - examples include the integration aspect of the [http://www.gateway.gov.uk Government Gateway], and the UK [[NHS Connecting for Health]] [[National Programme for IT#The Spine .28including PDS .26 PSIS.29|Data SPINE]]. External facing - joining up multiple Governments IS systems - an example would include the integration aspect of the [[Schengen Information System]] (SIS), developed to meet the requirements of the [[Schengen Agreement]].

===Objective===
The strategic objective of e-governance, or in this case G2G is to support and simplify governance for government, citizens, and businesses. The use of ICT can connect all parties and support processes and activities. Other objectives are to make government administration more transparent, speedy and accountable while addressing the society's needs and expectations through efficient public services and effective interaction between the people, businesses, and government.&lt;ref name="Oman Government"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oman|first1=ITA|title=eOman Portal|url=http://www.ita.gov.om/ITAPortal/Info/FAQ_eGovernmen.aspx#What_are_the_objectives_of_e-Governance|website=ita.gov.om |publisher=Governance of Oman|accessdate=2014-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delivery model===
Within every of those interaction domains, four sorts of activities take place:&lt;ref&gt;Mary Maureen Brown. "Electronic Government" Jack Rabin (ed.). Encyclopedia of Public Administration and Public Policy, Marcel Dekker, 2003, pp. 427–432 {{ISBN|0824742400}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pushing data over the internet, e.g.: regulative services, general holidays, public hearing schedules, issue briefs, notifications, etc.
two-way communications between one governmental department and another, users will interact in dialogue with agencies and post issues, comments, or requests to the agency.
Conducting transactions, e.g.: Lodging tax returns, applying for services and grants.
Governance, e.g.: To alter the national transition from passive info access to individual participation by:
* Informing the individual
* Representing an individual
* Consulting an individual
* Involving the individual

===Internal G2G (UK)===
In the field of networking, the Government Secure Intranet (GSi) puts in place a secure link between central government departments. It is an IP-based [[virtual private network]] based on broadband technology introduced in April 1998 and further upgraded in February 2004. Among other things, it offers a variety of advanced services including file transfer and search facilities, directory services, email exchange facilities (both between network members and over the Internet) as well as voice and video services. An additional network is currently also under development: the Public Sector Network (PSN) will be the network to interconnect public authorities (including departments and agencies in England; devolved administrations and local governments) and facilitate in particular sharing of information and services among each other.&lt;ref&gt;HM Government (December 2009). "Putting the Frontline First: smarter government". Accessed 30 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government to business ==
{{redirect|G2B|the scientific journal|Genes, Brain and Behavior}}

Government-to-Business (G2B) is the [[online]] non-commercial interaction between local and central government and the commercial business sector with the purpose of providing businesses information and advice on [[e-business]] [[best practices]]. G2B: Refers to the conduction through the Internet between government agencies and trading companies. B2G: Professional transactions between the company and the district, city, or federal regulatory agencies. B2G usually include recommendations to complete the measurement and evaluation of books and contracts.

===Objective===
The objective of G2B is to reduce difficulties for business, provide immediate information and enable digital communication by e-business (XML). In addition, the government should re-use the data in the report proper, and take advantage of commercial electronic transaction protocol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/government-to-business-g2b/12391 IGI-GLOBAL What is Government-to-Business (G2B) Retrieved 27 OCT.2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Government services are concentrated on the following groups: human services; community services; judicial services; transport services; land resources; business services; financial 
services and other.&lt;ref&gt;Bakry, S. H. "Development of e-government: a STOPE view." International Journal of 
Network Management. 2004, 14(5), 339-350.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the components listed above for each cluster of related services to the enterprise.

===Benefits for business===

E-government reduces costs and lowers the barrier of allowing companies to interact with the government. The interaction between the government and businesses reduces the time required for businesses to conduct a transaction. For instance, there is no need to commute to a government agency's office, and transactions may be conducted online instantly with the click of a mouse. This significantly reduces transaction time for the government and businesses alike.

E-Government provides a greater amount of information that the business needed, also it makes that information more clear. A key factor in business success is the ability to planand forecast through data-driven future. The government collected a lot of economic, demographic and other trends in the data. This makes the data more accessible to companies which may increase the chance of economic prosperity.

In addition, E-Government can help businesses navigate through government regulations by providing an intuitive site organization with a wealth of useful applications. The electronic filings of applications for environmental permits give an example of it. Companies often do not know how, when, and what they must apply. Therefore, failure to comply with environmental regulations up to 70%, a staggering figure&lt;ref&gt;According to an Environmental Results Program (ERP) study conducted in 1997 covering 2,000 (of 16,000 total) businesses.&lt;/ref&gt; most likely due to confusion about the requirements, rather than the product of willful disregard of the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/anf/research-and-tech/it-planning-and-collab/strat-planning/prev-plans/e-gov-strat-plan/section-2-the-benefits-of-e-government.html The Benefits of E-Government Retrieved 27 OCT.2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===

The government should concern that not all people are able to access the internet to gain online government services. The network reliability, as well as information on government bodies,  can influence public opinion and prejudice hidden agenda. There are many considerations and implementation, designing e-government, including the potential impact of government and citizens of disintermediation, the impact on economic, social and political factors, vulnerable to cyber attacks, and disturbances to the status quo in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Atkinson | first1 = Robert D. | last2 = Castro | first2 = Daniel | title = Digital Quality of Life | publisher = The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation | pages = 137–145 | year = 2008 | url=http://www.itif.org/files/DQOL-14.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

G2B rises the connection between government and businesses. Once the e-government began to develop, become more sophisticated, people will be forced to interact with e-government in the larger area. This may result in a lack of privacy for businesses as their government gets their more and more information. In the worst case, there is so much information in the electron transfer between the government and business, a system which is like [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] could be developed. As the government can access more information, the loss of privacy could be a cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/48629.html?wlc=1235202183 |title=AT&amp;T Sued for Role in Aiding US Government Surveillance |publisher=TechNewsWorld |author=Lyman, Jay |date=2006-02-01 |accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/08/analysis-new-la.html |title=Analysis: New Law Gives Government Six Months to Turn Internet and Phone Systems into Permanent Spying Architecture |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |author=Singel, Ryan |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview===
The main goal of government to business is to increase productivity by giving business more access to information in a more organize manner while lowering the cost of doing business as well as the ability to cut "red tape", save time, reduce operational cost and to create a more transparent business environment when dealing with government.

*Lowering cost of doing business – electronic transaction save time compared to conducting business in person.
*Cutting red tape – rules and regulation placed upon business normally take time and are most likely to cause a delay- in (G2B) will allow a much faster process with fewer delays and decreasing the number of rules and regulations
*Transparency – More information will be available, making G2B easier to communicate.

'''Government to business key points:'''

#Reduce the burden on business by adopting a process that enables collecting data once for multiple uses and streamlining redundant data.
#Key lines of business: regulations, economic development, trade, permits/licenses, grants/loans, and asset management.

'''Difference between G2B and B2G'''

*''Government to business (G2B)'' – Refers to the conducting of transactions between government bodies and business via the internet.
*''Business to the government (B2G)'' – Professional affairs conducted between companies and regional, municipal, or federal governing bodies. B2G typically encompasses the determination and evaluation of proposal and completion of the contract.

'''Conclusion:'''

The overall benefit of e-governance when dealing with business is that it enables the business to perform more efficiently.

==Challenges – international position==

E-governance is facing numerous challenges world over. These challenges are arising from administrative, legal, institutional and technological factors. The challenge includes security drawbacks such as spoofing, tampering, repudiation, disclosure, elevation of privilege, denial of service and other cyber crimes. Other sets of problems include implementation parts such as funding, management of change, privacy, authentication, delivery of services, standardization, technology issues and use of local languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2510">'''Ernst Pulgram''' (September 18, 1915 – August 17, 2005) was an [[Americans|American]] [[linguist]] of [[Austria]]n origins whose main interest lay in the [[Italic languages|Italic]] and [[Romance languages]]. He is survived by his wife, linguist [[Frances McSparran]].

Born and educated in [[Vienna]], he was forced to leave shortly after the [[Anschluss]] to escape from the Nazis. He moved to the United States and joined the US army to fight in [[WWII|World War II]]. Because he had left Vienna a few days before his PhD defence and thus was not able to complete the degree, shortly after the war Pulgram started a new PhD at [[Harvard University]] under the [[G.I. Bill]]. After graduation, he spent most of his career ([https://www.lib.umich.edu/faculty-history/faculty/ernst-pulgram 1948–1986]) at the [[University of Michigan]]. Throughout his life, he maintained ties to his Austrian homeland, which included in later years several Viennese linguists (such as historical English linguist [[Herbert Schendl]]).

One obituary read that Pulgram's death meant that "the last of the great Romanists who had to flee from the Nazis and went to the States, is gone."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lib.umich.edu/faculty-history/faculty/ernst-pulgram/obituary|title=Obituary|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=February 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulgram held he Visiting Professorships at universities in Florence, Cologne, Heidelberg, Regensburg, Vienna, Innsbruck, Munich, and Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lib.umich.edu/faculty-history/faculty/ernst-pulgram/obituary|title=Obituary|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:This was a timely capture (3926001309).jpg|thumb|Fight or flight?]]
The '''fight-or-flight response''' (also called '''hyperarousal''', or the '''acute stress response''') is a physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived [[Psychological trauma|harmful event]], [[Trauma (medicine)|attack]], or threat to survival.&lt;ref name="Cannon - Fight or Flight Response"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cannon|first=Walter|title=Wisdom of the Body|year=1932|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=United States|isbn=978-0393002058}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first described by [[Walter Bradford Cannon]].{{efn| 1 =Cannon referred to "the necessities of fighting or flight." in the first edition of 'Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear and Rage'' (1915), p.  211.  Some references say he first described the response in 1914 in [[The American Journal of Physiology]].}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bodily changes in pain, hunger, fear, and rage|author=[[Walter Bradford Cannon]]|first=|publisher=[[Appleton-Century-Crofts]]|year=1915|isbn=|location=New York|pages=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theory states that animals react to threats with a general discharge of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], preparing the animal for fighting or fleeing.&lt;ref name="Jansen - Intro fight or flight physiology"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jansen|first=A|author2=Nguyen, X |author3=Karpitsky, V |author4= Mettenleiter, M |title=Central Command Neurons of the Sympathetic Nervous System: Basis of the Fight-or-Flight Response|journal=Science Magazine|date=27 October 1995|volume=5236|issue=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the [[adrenal medulla]] produces a hormonal cascade that results in the secretion of [[catecholamines]], especially [[norepinephrine]] and [[epinephrine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Walter Bradford Cannon |title=Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear and Rage: An Account of Recent Researches into the Function of Emotional Excitement |year=1915 |publisher=[[Appleton-Century-Crofts]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hormones [[estrogen]], [[testosterone]], and [[cortisol]], as well as the neurotransmitters [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]], also affect how organisms react to stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adrenaline, Cortisol, Norepinephrine: The Three Major Stress Hormones, Explained|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/19/adrenaline-cortisol-stress-hormones_n_3112800.html|accessdate=16 August 2014|work=Hufflington Post|date=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiology ==

===Autonomic nervous system===
{{See also|Autonomic nervous system}}
The autonomic nervous system is a control system that acts largely unconsciously and regulates [[heart rate]], [[digestion]], [[respiratory rate]], [[pupillary dilation|pupillary response]], [[Micturition|urination]], and [[sexual arousal]]. This system is the primary mechanism in control of the fight-or-flight response and its role is mediated by two different components: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system.&lt;ref name="Human Physiology - Janig"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Janig|editor-first=W|title=Human Physiology|year=1989|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York, NY|pages=333–370|author=Schmidt, A; Thews, G|edition=2|chapter=Autonomic Nervous System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sympathetic nervous system====
{{See also|Sympathetic nervous system}}
The sympathetic nervous system originates in the [[spinal cord]] and its main function is to activate the physiological changes that occur during the fight-or-flight response. This component of the autonomic nervous system utilises and activates the release of [[norepinephrine]] in the reaction.&lt;ref name="Autonomic Nervous System - Chudler"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chudler|first=Eric|title=Neuroscience For Kids|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/auto.html|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parasympathetic nervous system====
{{See also|Parasympathetic nervous system}}
The parasympathetic nervous system originates in the sacral spinal cord and [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]], physically surrounding the sympathetic origin, and works in concert with the sympathetic nervous system. Its main function is to activate the "rest and digest" response and return the body to [[homeostasis]] after the fight or flight response. This system utilises and activates the release of the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]].&lt;ref name="Autonomic Nervous System - Chudler" /&gt;

===Reaction===
[[File:The Fight or Flight Response.png|thumb|upright=1.3|The fight-or-flight response]]
The reaction begins in the [[amygdala]], which triggers a neural response in the [[hypothalamus]]. The initial reaction is followed by activation of the [[pituitary gland]] and secretion of the hormone [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH]].&lt;ref name="ACTH Action"&gt;{{cite web |last=Margioris |first=Andrew |title=ACTH Action on the Adrenal |url=http://www.endotext.org/adrenal/adrenal5/adrenal5.htm |publisher=Endotext.org |accessdate=18 April 2013 |author2=Tsatsanis, Christos |date=April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306182338/http://www.endotext.org/adrenal/adrenal5/adrenal5.htm |archivedate=6 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[adrenal gland]] is activated almost simultaneously, via the sympathetic nervous system, and releases the hormone [[epinephrine]]. The release of chemical messengers results in the production of the hormone [[cortisol]], which increases [[blood pressure]], [[blood sugar]], and suppresses the [[immune system]].&lt;ref name="physiological reactions - Padgett &amp; Glaser"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Padgett|first=David|author2=Glaser, R|title=How stress influences the immune response|journal=Trends in Immunology|date=August 2003|volume=24|issue=8|pages=444–448|doi=10.1016/S1471-4906(03)00173-X|pmid=12909458|citeseerx=10.1.1.467.1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial response and subsequent reactions are triggered in an effort to create a boost of energy. This boost of energy is activated by epinephrine binding to [[cells (biology)|liver cells]] and the subsequent production of [[glucose]].&lt;ref name="Glycogen Metabolism - King"&gt;{{cite web|last=King|first=Michael|title=PATHWAYS: GLYCOGEN &amp; GLUCOSE|url=http://neuromuscular.wustl.edu/pathol/diagrams/glycogen.htm|publisher=Washington University, St. Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the circulation of cortisol functions to turn [[fatty acids]] into available energy, which prepares muscles throughout the body for response.&lt;ref name="Cell Communication in Fight or Flight"&gt;{{cite web |title=HOW CELLS COMMUNICATE DURING THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT RESPONSE |url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/cells/fight_flight/ |publisher=University of Utah |accessdate=18 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808004906/http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/cells/fight_flight/ |archivedate=8 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Catecholamine hormones, such as [[Epinephrine|adrenaline]] ([[epinephrine]]) or [[noradrenaline]] (norepinephrine), facilitate immediate physical reactions associated with a preparation for violent [[muscular]] action and:&lt;ref name=gleitman&gt;{{Cite book|author= [[Henry Gleitman]], Alan J.

===Function of physiological changes===
The physiological changes that occur during the fight or flight response are activated in order to give the body increased strength and speed in anticipation of fighting or running. Some of the specific physiological changes and their functions include:&lt;ref name="Physiological Changes - Tripod"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stress Management for Health Course|title=The Fight Flight Response|url=http://stresscourse.tripod.com/id11.html|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Science of Stress - Olpin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Olpin|first=Michael|title=The Science of Stress|url=http://faculty.weber.edu/molpin/healthclasses/1110/bookchapters/stressphysiologychapter.htm|publisher=Weber State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increased [[blood flow]] to the muscles activated by diverting blood flow from other parts of the body.
* Increased blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugars, and fats in order to supply the body with extra energy.
* The [[Coagulation|blood clotting]] function of the body speeds up in order to prevent [[bleeding|excessive blood loss]] in the event of an injury sustained during the response.
* Increased [[Muscle tone|muscle tension]] in order to provide the body with extra speed and strength.

==Emotional components==

===Emotion regulation===
{{See also|Emotional self-regulation}}
In the context of the fight or flight response, emotional regulation is used proactively to avoid threats of stress or to control the level of emotional arousal.&lt;ref name="Emotional Regulation - Cistler"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cistler|first=Josh|author2=Bunmi O. Olatunji |author3=Matthew T. Feldner |author4=John P. Forsyth |title=Emotion Regulation and the Anxiety Disorders: An Integrative Review|journal=Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment|year=2010|volume=32|issue=1|pages=68–82|doi=10.1007/s10862-009-9161-1|pmid=20622981|pmc=2901125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emotional Regulation - Gross"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gross|first=James|title=Sharpening the Focus: Emotion Regulation, Arousal, and Social Competence|journal=Psychological Inquiry|year=1998|volume=9|issue=4|pages=287–290|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0904_8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotional reactivity===
During the reaction, the intensity of emotion that is brought on by the stimulus will also determine the nature and intensity of the behavioral response.&lt;ref name="Emotional Reactivity - Avero"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avero|first=Pedro|author2=Calvo, M|title=Emotional reactivity to social-evaluative stress: genderdifferences in response systems concordance|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=1 July 1999|volume=27|issue=1|pages=155–170|doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(98)00229-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with higher levels of emotional reactivity may be prone to [[anxiety]] and [[aggression]], which illustrates the implications of appropriate emotional reaction in the fight or flight response.&lt;ref name="Emotional Reactivity - Carthy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carthy|first=T|author2=Horesh N |author3=Apter A |author4=Edge MD |author5=Gross JJ |title=Emotional reactivity and cognitive regulation in anxious children|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy|date=May 2010|volume=48|issue=5|pages=384–393|doi=10.1016/j.brat.2009.12.013|pmid=20089246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emotional reactivity - Valiente"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valiente|first=C|author2=Eisenberg N |author3=Smith CL |author4=Reiser M |author5=Fabes RA |author6=Losoya S |author7=Guthrie IK |author8=Murphy BC |title=The relations of effortful control and reactive control to children's externalising problems: A longitudinal assessment|journal=Personality|date=December 2003|volume=71|issue=6|pages=1171–1196|doi=10.1111/1467-6494.7106011 |pmid=14633062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive components==

===Content specificity===
The specific components of cognitions in the fight or flight response seem to be largely negative. These negative cognitions may be characterised by: attention to negative stimuli, the perception of ambiguous situations as negative, and the recurrence of recalling negative words.&lt;ref name="Content specificity - Reid"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reid|first1=Sophie C.|last2=Salmon|first2=Karen|author3=Peter F. Lovibond|title=Cognitive Biases in Childhood Anxiety, Depression, and Aggression: Are They Pervasive or Specific?|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|date=October 2006|volume=30|issue=5|pages=531–549|doi=10.1007/s10608-006-9077-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also may be specific negative thoughts associated with emotions commonly seen in the reaction.&lt;ref name="Content Specificity - Beck"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Aaron|title=Cognitive Therapy and the Emotional Disorders|year=1979|publisher=Penguin Books|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perception of control===
{{See also|Control (psychology)}}
[[Perceived control]] relates to an individual's thoughts about control over situations and events.&lt;ref name="Perceived Control - Weems"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weems|first=CF|author2=Silverman, WK|title=An integrative model of control: implications for understanding emotion regulation and dysregulation in childhood anxiety|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|date=April 2006|volume=91|issue=2|pages=113–124|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2006.01.009|pmid=16487599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceived control should be differentiated from actual control because an individual's beliefs about their abilities may not reflect their actual abilities. Therefore, overestimation or underestimation of perceived control can lead to anxiety and aggression.&lt;ref name="Perceived Control - Brendgen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brendgen|first=M|author2=Vitaro F |author3=Turgeon L |author4=Poulin F |author5=Wanner B |title=Is there a dark side of positive illusions?

===Social information processing===
{{See also|Social information processing (cognition)}}
The social information processing model proposes a variety of factors that determine behavior in the context of social situations and preexisting thoughts.&lt;ref name="Social Information Processing - Crick"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crick|first=Nicki|author2=Dodge, Kenneth|title=A review and reformulation of social information-processing mechanisms in children's social adjustment|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=January 1994|volume=115|issue=1|pages=74–101|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.115.1.74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attribution of hostility, especially in ambiguous situations, seems to be one of the most important cognitive factors associated with the fight or flight response because of its implications towards aggression.&lt;ref name="Social Information Processing - Dodge"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodge|first=Kenneth|title=Social cognition and children's aggressive behavior|journal=Journal of Child Development|date=March 1980|volume=51|issue=1|pages=162–170|doi=10.2307/1129603|jstor=1129603}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==

===Evolutionary perspective===
An [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation is that early animals had to react to threatening stimuli quickly and did not have time to psychologically and physically prepare themselves. The fight or flight response provided them with the mechanisms to rapidly respond to threats against survival.&lt;ref name="Purpose of fight or fight - Grohol"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grohol|first=John|title=What's the purpose of the fight or flight response?|url=http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2012/12/04/whats-the-purpose-of-the-fight-or-flight-response/|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Concepts of Stress - Goldstein"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=David|author2=Kopin, I|title=Evolution of concepts of stress|journal=Stress|year=2007|volume=10|issue=2|doi=10.1080/10253890701288935|pages=109–20|pmid=17514579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
A typical example of the stress response is a grazing [[zebra]]. If the zebra sees a [[lion]] closing in for the kill, the stress response is activated as a means to escape its [[Predatory imminence continuum|predator]]. The escape requires intense muscular effort, supported by all of the body’s systems. The [[sympathetic nervous system]]’s activation  provides for these needs. A similar example involving fight is of a cat about to be attacked by a dog. The cat shows accelerated heartbeat, [[piloerection]] (hair standing on end), and pupil dilation, all signs of sympathetic arousal.&lt;ref name=gleitman/&gt; Note that the zebra and cat still maintain [[homeostasis]] in all states.

===Varieties of responses===
{{more citations needed|date=October 2016}}
[[File:Ruseckas-Stumbro medžioklė.jpg|thumb|Bison hunted by dogs]]
Animals respond to threats in many complex ways. Rats, for instance, try to escape when threatened, but will fight when cornered. Some animals stand perfectly still so that predators will not see them. Many animals freeze or play dead when touched in the hope that the predator will lose interest.

Other animals have alternative self-protection methods. Some species of [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]] animals [[Chromatophore|change color]] swiftly, to camouflage themselves.&lt;ref name="Fish changing colors"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gill|first=A.C.|title=Revision of the Indo-Pacific dottyback fish subfamily Pseudochrominae (Perciformes: Pseudochromidae)|year=2004|publisher=Smithiana Monographs|pages=1–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; These responses are triggered by the sympathetic nervous system, but, in order to fit the model of fight or flight, the idea of flight must be broadened to include escaping capture either in a physical or sensory way. Thus, flight can be disappearing to another location or just disappearing in place. And often both fight and flight are combined in a given situation.

The fight or flight actions also have polarity – the individual can either fight or flee against something that is threatening, such as a hungry lion, or fight for or fly towards something that is needed, such as the safety of the shore from a raging river.

A threat from another animal does not always result in immediate fight or flight. There may be a period of heightened awareness, during which each animal interprets behavioral signals from the other. Signs such as paling, piloerection, immobility, sounds, and body language communicate the status and intentions of each animal. There may be a sort of negotiation, after which fight or flight may ensue, but which might also result in playing, mating, or nothing at all. An example of this is kittens playing: each kitten shows the signs of sympathetic arousal, but they never inflict real damage.

'''Idea networking''' is a qualitative method of doing a [[cluster analysis]] of any collection of statements, developed by Mike Metcalfe at the [[University of South Australia]].&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"&gt;{{cite book |last=Metcalfe |first=Mike |date=2014 |chapter=Idea networking |title=How concepts solve management problems |location=Cheltenham, UK |publisher=[[Edward Elgar Publishing]] |pages=62–74 |isbn=9781783471072 |oclc=868380268 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=EuJnAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Networking lists of statements acts to reduce them into a handful of clusters or categories. The statements might be source from interviews, text, web sites, [[focus group]]s, [[SWOT analysis]] or community consultation. Idea networking is [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] as it does not assume any prior classification system to cluster the statements. Rather keywords or issues in the statements are individually linked (paired). These links can then be entered into network software to be displayed as a network with clusters. When named, these clusters provide emergent categories, meta themes, frames or concepts which represent, structure or sense-make the collection of statements.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;

==Method==
An idea network can be constructed in the following way:&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;
* 60 to 200 statements are listed and assigned reference numbers. 
* A table is constructed showing which statements (by reference number) are linked (paired) and why. For example, statement 1 maybe linked to statements 4, 23, 45, 67, 89 and 107 because they all are about the weather (see table). 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Statement !! Is Linked To !! Because They Are About
|-
| 1 || 4, 23, 45, 67, 89, 107 || Weather
|-
| 2 || 16, 29, 46, 81 || Light
|-
| 3 || 23, 45, 67, 89, 107 || Interaction
|-
| 4 || 13, 16, 34, 78, 81 || Weather
|-
| Etc. || Etc. || Etc.
|}

The number of links per statement should be from 1 to 7; many more will result in a congested network diagram. This means choosing why the statements are linked may need grading as strong or weak, or by sub sets. For example, statements linked as being about weather conditions may be further subdivided into those about good weather, wet weather or bad weather, etc.). This linking is sometimes called 'coding' in thematic analysis which highlights that the statements can be linked for several and different reasons (source, context, time, etc.). There maybe many tens of reasons why statements are linked. The same statements may be linked for different reasons. The number of reasons should not be restricted to low number as so anticipate the resultant clustering. 
*The reference numbers are inputed to a network diagramming software, usually in the form of a matrix with the reference numbers along the top and side of the matrix. Each cell will then have a 1 or 0 to indicate whether its row and column reference number are linked. 
*The software is instructed to draw network diagram using maximum node repulsion. This encourages cluster formation.  Around 5 clusters are identified in the network diagram, both visually and using the cluster identification algorithms supplied with the software (e.g. Newnan Girvan sub-groups) 
[[File:Idea Networking Example.jpg|thumb|Idea Network]]
*A descriptive collective adjective name is determined for each cluster of statements (a meta narrative, classification name or label). 
*The list of statements is then reported as being clustered into these five or so cluster names (themes, frames, concepts). For example, one might report that your analysis of the statements shows that those at community meeting were using the concepts of exposure, interaction, safety, light and inspiration in their responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Metcalfe |first=Mike |date=April 2007 |title=Problem conceptualisation using idea networks |journal=Systemic Practice and Action Research |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=141–150 |doi=10.1007/s11213-006-9056-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underlying philosophy ==
In his book ''[[Notes on the Synthesis of Form]]'', the pragmatist [[Christopher Alexander]] suggested networking the ideas of clients as means to identifying the major facets of an architectural design.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt; This is still used modern design work usually using [[cluster analysis]]. Modern [[social network analysis software]] provides a useful tool for how these ideas can be networked. 
This simply adds ideas to the list of computers, power stations, people and events that can be networked (see [[Network theory]]).&lt;ref name="socialcapitalnetknowtransfer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Inkpen |first1=Andrew C. |last2=Tsang |first2=Eric W. K. |date=January 2005 |title=Social capital, networks, and knowledge transfer |journal=[[Academy of Management Review]] |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=146–165 |doi=10.5465/AMR.2005.15281445 |jstor=20159100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The links between ideas can be represented in a matrix or network. Modern network diagramming software, with node repulsion algorithms, allows useful visual representation of these networks revealing clusters of nodes.

When networking peoples' statements or ideas, these become the nodes and the links are provided by an analyst linking those statements thought to be similar. Keywords, synonyms, experience or context might be used to provide this linking. For example, the statements: (1) "That war is economics progressed by other means, might be considered linked to the statement"; (2) "That progress unfortunately needs the innovation which is a consequence of human conflict". 
 
Linguistic [[pragmatism]] argues we use our conceptions to interpret our perceptions (sensory inputs).&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;{{rp|18}} These conceptions might be represented by words as conceptual ideas or concepts. For example, if we use the conceptual idea or concepts of justice to interpret the actions of people, we get a different interpretation (or meaning) compared to using the conceptual idea of personal power. Using the conceptual idea of justice makes certain action ideas seem reasonable. These may include due process, legal representation, hearing both sides, have norms or regulations for comparison. Therefore, there is a relationship between conceptual ideas and related apparently rational action ideas.

If the statements gathered at a consultative meeting are considered action ideas, then clusters of these similar actions ideas might be considered to examples of a meta idea or conceptual idea. These are also called themes, and frames. Modern research extending Miller's Magic number 7 plus or minus 2, to idea handling, suggests a five-part classification is appropriate for humans.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;{{rp|145}}

==Notable applications and uses==

Using networking to cluster statements is considered useful because:&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;

*It provides a multi-dimensional alternative to [[post-it note]]s in clusters.
*It offers a convenient graphic which can be presented in reports and analysed using network metrics (See [[Computer assisted qualitative data analysis software]]). 
*It is an auditable process where each step taken can be explained in supporting documentation.
*It is a qualitative alternative, and thus more subtle and transparent, than [[NVivo]], [[thematic analysis]], [[cluster analysis]], [[factor analysis]], [[multidimensional scaling]] or [[principal component analysis]]. This subtleness includes enabling the analyst to deal with metaphor, synonyms, pronouns and alternative terminology generally. No variables (variation in numerical data) are necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3877">'''''Jintian''''' ({{zh|c=今天|l=Today}}) is the title of a Chinese literary journal. Founded in 1978,  it was the first non-official literary journal in the People's Republic of China since the 1950s. It ran for nine issues until it was censored in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica, entry for Bei Dao. https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bei-Dao#ref846577 Retrieved 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It was revived in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Internet Literature in China, by Michel Hockx, Columbia University Press, 2015. pp.157-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
''Jintian'' was created in 1978 by [[Mang Ke]], [[Bei Dao]] and others, and was first distributed on and around [[Democracy Wall]] in [[Beijing]]. It was instrumental in bringing the [[Misty Poets]] into the open, publishing work by [[Bei Dao]], [[Duo Duo]], [[Shu Ting]], [[Yang Lian (poet)|Yang Lian]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Asia Literary Review, http://www.asialiteraryreview.com/modern-chinese-poetry-insistent-voices&lt;/ref&gt; It ran for nine issues and published four books (poetry by Mang Ke, Bei Dao, and Jiang He, and a novella by Ai Shan [pen-name of Bei Dao]). It also ran two poetry readings (on 8 April and 21 October 1979), and two exhibitions of The Stars, the first non-official painters.&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Companion to Modern East Asian Literature Front Cover, by Kirk A. Denton, Ju-Chan Fulton, Sharalyn Orbaugh Columbia University Press, 2012, pp. 522-524.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1990 ''Jintian'' was revived overseas, with Bei Dao as editor, and initially published from ''Stockholm''. It is now an online journal, featuring writing in Chinese.&lt;ref&gt; Internet Literature in China, by Michel Hockx, Columbia University Press, 2015. pp.157-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations into English==
Some of the poems, short stories and essays first published in ''Jintian'' have been translated into English, notably in the series Chinese Writing Today, the first two volumes published by the [[Wellsweep Press]], in the UK, and the third volume published by the Zephyr Press in the USA.

The [[editor-in-chief]] is John C. Lyden ([[Grand View University]]). It was established in 1997 by William L. Blizek and [[Ronald Burke (theologian)|Ronald Burke]] ([[University of Nebraska at Omaha]]), who became interested in the subject of religion and film after hearing [[Andrew Greeley]] speak about images of God in popular movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/Edit1.1.htm |title=Journal of Religion &amp; Film: Vol 1, No. 1 Editorial |publisher=Unomaha.edu |date= |accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded in 1969 by the Revd Canon Michael Bourdeaux.

==History==
In the 1950s, Michael Bourdeaux spent a year in [[Moscow]] as a part of the first wave of British exchange students; he soon found only 41 [[Russian Orthodox Church]]es to still be functioning out of the 1,600 before the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] in 1917. This prompted him to take up the cause of those persecuted for their religious faith.&lt;ref name=rus/&gt; 

In 1969 Bourdeaux founded at [[Chislehurst]] the Centre for the Study of Religion and Communism&lt;ref name=rus&gt;''The Future of Freedom in Russia'', by William J. Vanden Heuvel. Published by Templeton Foundation Press, 2000. {{ISBN|1-890151-43-2}}. p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; together with Sir John Lawrence, and with the help of [[Leonard Schapiro]] and Peter Reddaway, Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at [[George Washington University]]. In the early 1970s he bought the old parish school on [[Keston]] Common and the centre was renamed [[Keston College]]. Later it broadened its purview to include former communist countries with its main concerns being the former [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]].&lt;ref name=kes&gt;[http://www.keston.org.uk/information.shtml About us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107044403/http://www.keston.org.uk/information.shtml |date=2009-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years it played a key role in the revival of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]],&lt;ref&gt;''Russian Orthodoxy Resurgent: Faith and Power in the New Russia'', by John Garrard, Carol Garrard. Published by Princeton University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|0-691-12573-2}}. ''Page xv''.&lt;/ref&gt; and has become a leading voice on [[religious freedom]] in former communist countries, with an emphasis on the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/2000-1/weekly/210900/ads.htm  the Keston Institute is an Oxford- based research charity which is...] ''[[Oxford University]] Gazette.'', 2000-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the enterprise was relocated to Oxford.

In 1984 [[Michael Bourdeaux]] won the [[Templeton Prize]]. The current chairman at the Keston Institute is [[Xenia Dennen]].

Since 2007, the Keston Institute's archive and library have been under the care of the Keston Center for Religion, Politics, &amp; Society at [[Baylor University]], [[Waco, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baylor.edu/kestoncenter/ Keston Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since April 2014, she has been the Director and CEO of the [[Australian Museum]], the first woman to hold the position in the museum's 191-year history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/australian-museums-new-director-kim-mckay-is-a-rare-find/story-fn9n8gph-1226873358205|title = The Australian|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She co-founded the [[Clean Up Australia]] campaign in 1989 and the Clean Up the World campaign in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleanuptheworld.org&lt;/ref&gt; with the support of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP). Clean Up the World operates in more than 125 countries. She co-created [[The National Geographic Society]]'s [[The Genographic Project]], the world's largest DNA population study, and is the co-author of five books.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.betruegreen.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
McKay was born in Sydney to Francis Gordon McKay and Coral McKay (nee Thompson). She attended Mackellar Girls’ High School, in Manly Vale, and The [[University of Technology, Sydney]] (UTS), where she graduated with a BA Communications degree majoring in journalism, public relations and sociology, in 1980.

==Career==
From 1983-87, McKay was a consultant and then partner at Harfield McKay Communications, where she specialised in major events sponsorship and tourism activities, including The BOC Challenge solo around the world yacht race in 1982/82 and 1986-87. She also worked on Australian Professional Surfing Association events and Law Week for the [[Law Society of New South Wales]]. 	

In 1989, McKay co-founded Clean Up&lt;ref&gt;Australia www.cleanup.org.au&lt;/ref&gt; following the voluntary coordination of the historic Clean Up the Harbour Day in Sydney. She worked in partnership for 10 years with 1994 Australian of the Year [[Ian Kiernan]] AO to develop Clean Up into a leading non-profit community environmental organisation. She served as Deputy Chairwoman from 1989 to 2009 and developed the "Rubbish Report" volunteer citizen science program for data collection and analysis, one of the first "citizen science" community initiatives. Clean Up Australia became one of the largest community environmental projects in Australia, operating in more than 900 cities and towns across the country, involving more than half a million volunteers at its peak.

In 1992, McKay co-founded Clean Up the World, securing a partnership with UNEP to endorse and support the activity, along with international corporate support. The program operates in more than 125 countries and involves many millions of volunteers.  McKay, who was also Deputy Chairwoman of Clean Up the World from 1993-2009, told ABC radio that: "The belief that everyone can make a difference is a driving theme behind my actions."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/classic/throsby/stories/s3119820.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, McKay established Profile Communications Pty Ltd, a Sydney-based event marketing and communications consultancy. The company focused on special event creation and marketing communications programs, with clients including [[Discovery Communications]] and Discovery Channel [[Eco-Challenge]] in Cairns. McKay was Managing Director of Profile Communications until 1998, when she closed the company to move to the United States to work for Discovery Communications.

In 1998, McKay joined Discovery Communications, based in Washington D.C., where she oversaw the marketing and communications for Discovery Channel's largest event and documentary production — the Emmy-award winning Discovery Channel Eco-Challenge, the world's leading adventure sports race. She worked in close collaboration with the Executive Producer and the Race Director [[Mark Burnett]] to ensure the successful operation of the extreme sports event, held annually in remote locations around the world including Morocco and Patagonia.

In 2000, McKay joined National Geographic Channels International, where she was responsible for the global marketing and communications activities for the world's fastest-growing cable channel. 

In 2004, McKay returned to Australia to start Momentum2,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.momentum2.com.au&lt;/ref&gt; a Sydney-based marketing and communications agency specialising in major events, corporate sustainability and social responsibility programs. Key clients included [[National Geographic]], [[Qantas]] and [[Harpo Productions]] (Oprah's Ultimate Australian Adventure) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.oprah.com/packages/oprahs-ultimate-australian-adventure.html.

McKay co-created The Genographic Project&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalgeograhic.com/genographic&lt;/ref&gt; with population geneticist Dr [[Spencer Wells]] for the National Geographic Society, in partnership with [[IBM]]. The multiyear research project, the world's largest DNA population study, uses cutting-edge genetic and computational technologies to analyze historical patterns in DNA from around the world, to better understand our shared genetic roots. 

In February 2014, McKay was appointed as the 17th director/curator of the Australian Museum, succeeding Mr Frank Howarth&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/kim-mckay-new-director-of-australian-museum/news-story/ea030c86c37da29ad16104b6bacd9ad4?sv=3e4a69d4f001f6a8a4a256dc37917904&amp;nk=79cd258c64644f736ee3edc8b0a4e9bd-1522068812&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6249">[[File:Ma’oz Hayyim.JPG|250px|thumbnail|Ma’oz Hayyim Synagogue]]
The '''Maoz Haim Synagogue''' was originally constructed in the 3rd century as a simple [[Byzantine]]-era type [[basilica]] building, later apsidical, in the [[Beit She'an]] region in northern [[Israel]]. Discovered in February 1974 by Mr. A. Ya’aqobi during some unrelated digging near [[Maoz Haim]], it stands out as an unusual archeological find that contains a record of synagogue development from a time of otherwise sparse historiography. It was even developing right through times of anti-Judaic legislation and sermonizing.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 211&lt;/ref&gt; The [[synagogue]] was located amongst a large settlement in which it served as a center of worship for [[Jews]] there from its beginning up through its final destruction by fire sometime in the early 7th century.&lt;ref name=Levine89&gt;Levine, Lee, ed. Ancient Synagogues Revealed, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout==
The initial layout began as a fourteen by twelve and a half meter square room with two rows of five columns with benches lining the walls, although none remained standing.&lt;ref&gt;אפרים שטרן. אנציקלופדיה החדשה לחפירות ארכיאולוגית בארץ ישראל&lt;/ref&gt; There was a single entrance eastward which is considered to be unusual. Most synagogues, aside from others which were located in the same northern Galil region, did not share this feature. However, it is mentioned in rabbinic sources as part of the synagogue layout in order to emulate the eastward entrance utilized by the [[Tabernacle]].&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 199&lt;/ref&gt; The focal point of the synagogue was located southward, towards [[Jerusalem]]. Such an orientation had not previously been a feature of synagogues of the era, but was a new custom which was just beginning to take hold.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 195&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially noticeable with remodeling which was done in the 4th century, altering the synagogue to feature an apse in the southern wall. While the synagogue did not originally have a narthex, one was added during the later phases of building to the north, although it was totally destroyed. The later phases also added an additional entrance to the north, presumably to allow for easier access to the sanctuary.

==Apse==
The apse, where the Torah Shrine had previously stood in the first phase of the synagogue, was further modified in the 6th century to include a raised platform enclosed by a [[chancel screen]] which may have been used to emphasize the sanctity of the Torah shrine area as compared to the rest of the synagogue or the congregation.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, Steven. This Holy Place: On the Sanctity of the Synagogue During the Greco-Roman Period, 222&lt;/ref&gt; Such separations were very common in ancient synagogues and the raised [[bima]] area is what shows that this was no exception.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee, ed. Ancient Synagogues Revealed, 87&lt;/ref&gt; The area of the screen depicted a menorah as well as [[Hebrew]] letters. The only Hebrew word in the entire building was [[Shalom]]; the remainder of the inscriptions were in [[Greek language|Greek]].

Behind the bima there was an area, possibly a geniza, in which several coins, pottery, and glass were found, which were amongst the few artifacts that were found at all at the site. The coins themselves were from the Byzantine era and helped identify the stages of building and development. More coins, fifty in all, were found outside the southern wall which were most likely hidden there amongst broken roof tiles in order to serve as a possible emergency funds, although the original owner never had the chance to claim them.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee, ed. Ancient Synagogues Revealed, 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mosaic Floor==
There were many interesting [[mosaic]]s which were found at the dig site. The only figures found were birds, but there were also many Jewish symbols portrayed in mosaic form, including a [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], an [[etrog]], a [[shofar]] and grapes. However, the symbols and birds were covered up in the 7th century, transforming the synagogue into one which was aniconic, likely as an act of piety.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 367&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to this, the majority of the remaining floor was primarily composed of [[geometric patterns]]. Geometric patterns were popular before as in the earliest layer to an extent, but likely were especially valued in an aniconic society. However, it was not well preserved in the upper layers due to the aforementioned destruction of uncertain cause and additional construction that occurred by the local populace afterwards.&lt;ref name=Levine89/&gt; Despite this, the mosaic floor from the initial stage of construction was better preserved as it had been filled in with approximately 30 centimeters of dirt to lay the new aniconic floor, although not many artifacts were found within it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6834">The '''Mappae clavicula''' is a medieval Latin text containing manufacturing recipes for crafts materials, including for metals, glass, mosaics, and dyes and tints for materials. The information and style in the recipes is very terse. Each recipe consists of the names of the ingredients and typically about two sentences on combining the ingredients together. A small minority of the recipes go to about six sentences. The text comes with a short preamble, and other than that it is just recipes. The number of recipes was expanded over the course of the medieval centuries, and some medieval copies have deletions as well as additions, so it is better thought of as a family of texts with a largely common core, not a single text. Most of the ''Mappae Clavicula'' recipes are also in medieval Latin in a text known as the ''Compositiones ad Tingenda'' (English: "Recipes for Coloring (or Tingeing)").&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2848238 "Notes on Some Manuscripts of the ''Mappae Clavicula''"], by Rozelle P. Johnson, year 1935. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/226251 A Review of ''Compositiones variae'' from Codex 490, Biblioteca Capitolare], by Lynn White, year 1940. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rB3cIVVq-YUC&amp;pg=PA32 ''Books of Secrets in Medieval and Early Modern Culture''], by William Eamon, year 1996, pages 32-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and accretion ==
The core was probably originally compiled around AD 600, perhaps in [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, in Greek. The core contains items traceable to earlier Alexandrian Greek texts, particularly the [[Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis|Stockholm papyrus]] and [[Leyden papyrus X|Leiden Papyrus X]], which are Greek texts dated to the 2nd or 3rd century AD that contain some of the same and similar recipes. The first few recipes in the Phillipps-Corning manuscript&lt;ref name=PhillippsCorning /&gt; of the ''Mappae clavicula'' were long considered integral, but they form a distinct separate entity,  the ''De coloribus et mixtionibus'', which survives (in whole or in part) in at least 62 manuscripts.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;Clarke, M. (2001) ''The Art of All Colours: Mediaeval Recipe Books for Painters and Illuminators''. London: Archetype Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The core of the Latin ''Mappae clavicula'' is very likely a translation of a Greek text, although the original Greek text (if it existed) does not exist today.

The best manuscripts of the ''Mappae clavicula'' date from the eighth to the twelfth century.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, C. S. and J. G.

One of the fullest collections of recipes is in a certain manuscript dated late 12th century in which about 300 recipes are presented. In this manuscript, called the Phillipps-Corning manuscript, some of the names for some materials are Arabic names (e.g. ''alquibriz'' from the Arabic for sulphur, ''atincar'' from the Arabic for borax, ''alcazir'' from the Arabic for tin).&lt;ref name=PhillippsCorning&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/archaeologiaormi32sociuoft#page/187/mode/1up ''Mappae clavicula'' from a 12th-century manuscript], text published in Latin by Thomas Phillipps in year 1847. The original manuscript that Thomas Phillipps possessed, dated late 12th century, is now in the hands of the Corning Museum of Glass. Hence it is referred to as "the Phillipps-Corning manuscript". A digital image of it is downloadable at the [http://www.cmog.org/library/manuscript-mappae-clavicula Corning Museum of Glass, MS 5].&lt;/ref&gt; The recipes containing the Arabic names are historically later, and are in all likelihood no earlier than the 12th century. Certain earlier manuscripts have about 200 recipes.

The  principal manuscripts are:
* The ''Lucca MS'', Lucca, Biblioteca Capitolare Feliniana, Codex 490, the oldest witness, c. 800.
* The Sélestat MS, Sélestat, Bibliothèque Humaniste, MS 17. A very full yet old witness, early ninth century.
* The ''Codex Matritensis'' ('Madrid codex'), Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional, MS A.16 (Was: MS A.19), c. 1130.
* The Phillipps-Corning Manuscript, Corning Museum of Glass, MS 5, late twelfth century.&lt;ref name=PhillippsCorning /&gt;

These  are simply among the fullest [[Textual criticism|witnesses]] - there are dozens more that preserve extracts.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;

== Title ==
The title, ''Mappae clavicula'', is absurd, translating approximately as 'the little key to the small cloth'. The best explanation is that it is a mis-translation from a Greek original, in which χειρόκμητον ''kheirókmēton'' ('knack' or 'trick of the trade') was mis-read as χειρόμακτρον ''kheirómaktron'' ('hand-towel').&lt;ref&gt;Robert Halleux, 'Recettes d'artisan, recettes d'alchimiste', in: R. Jansen-Sieben (ed.) ''Artes mechanicae'', Archives et bibliothèques de Belgique, no. spécial 34 (Brussels, 1989), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the observation that certain recipes derive from the Greek technical papyri, the [[Leyden papyrus X]] and the [[Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis|Stockholm papyrus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7450">'''Mono-ha''' (もの派) is the name given to a group of 20th-century Japanese artists. The Mono-ha artists explored the encounter between natural and industrial materials, such as stone, steel plates, glass, light bulbs, cotton, sponge, paper, wood, wire, rope, leather, oil, and water, arranging them in mostly unaltered, ephemeral states. The works focus as much on the interdependency of these various elements and the surrounding space as on the materials themselves.

==Origin of the Term “Mono-ha” and its Members==

“Mono-ha” is usually translated in a literal manner, as “School of Things.” The Mono-ha artists regularly assert that “Mono-ha” was a term disparagingly coined by critics (specifically Teruo Fujieda and Toshiaki Minemura  in ''Bijutsu Techo'' magazine in 1973) well after they had begun to exhibit their work, and they did not begin as an organized collective. Many of the Mono-ha artists were first exhibited at Tamura and Maki Galleries in Tokyo owned by Nobuo[[(Shinro) Yamagiishi]] who was also an art writer and whose archives are in the collection of [[The National Art Center Tokyo]].

Toshiaki Minemura explains in his 1986 essay “What Was Mono-ha?,” that in terms of their academic background and intellectual exchange, the Mono-ha artists are divided into three groups:&lt;ref&gt;Minemura, Toshiaki. [https://www.kamakura.gallery/mono-ha/minemura-en.html "What was MONO-HA?"], ''MONO-HA'', Kamakura Gallery, 1986, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''"The [[Lee Ufan|Lee]] + [[Tama Art University|Tamabi]] Connection.”''' This comprises [[Nobuo Sekine]], [[Kishio Suga]], Shingo Honda, Katsuhiko Narita and Katsurō Yoshida in the painting department, and  [[Susumu Koshimizu]] in the sculpture department at [[Tama Art University]] (aka Tamabi) as well as [[Jiro Takamatsu]] and [[Lee Ufan]], a Korean artist who is a close friend of Sekine.

# '''“The [[Nihon University|Nichidai]] Connection,”''' students from the [[Nihon University]] (aka Nichidai) Fine Arts Department—whose central figure was Noriyuki Haraguchi—also known as the “Yokosuka Group,” due to Haraguchi’s upbringing in Yokosuka and his critique of the local US military presence through his work.&lt;ref&gt;''Kishio Suga''. Los Angeles: Blum &amp; Poe, 2012, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-Political Context==

Mono-ha emerged in response to a number of social, cultural and political precedents set in the 1960s. With the exception of Lee Ufan, who was a decade older, most of the Mono-ha artists were just beginning their careers when the violent student protests of 1968–69 occurred.

At the same time, there was much protest against the second extension of the US-Japan Security Treaty (known in abbreviated Japanese as ''[[Anpo]]'') in 1970, binding Japan into providing logistical support for the US war in Vietnam. Coupled with demands for the reversion of [[Okinawa]] by 1972 and the removal of nuclear weapons based there, the climate of protest during this period was symptomatic of a growing distrust of the United States’ intentions towards Asia and its dominant position in the bilateral relationship with Japan. The activism of the “''Anpo'' generation” gave rise to a highly intellectual counterculture that was both critical of US “[[imperialism]]” and acutely self-aware of its Japanese identity.&lt;ref&gt;Munroe, Alexandra. ''Japanese Art After 1945: Scream Against the Sky''. Harry N. Abrams Inc, 1994. p.215&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mono-ha artists typically deny involvement with student activist movements at the time, though it is thought that the tense political climate influenced their work, allowing them to grapple with and make sense of their unease and disillusionment with postwar modernity in their different ways.

==Recent Attention in the United States==

In 2012, [[Blum &amp; Poe]] gallery introduced the Mono-ha art into the US with the survey exhibition “Requiem for the Sun: The Art of Mono-ha,” curated by Mika Yoshitake. The gallery has also held solo exhibitions of [[Lee Ufan]], [[Kishio Suga]], [[Susumu Koshimizu]], [[Koji Enokura]], and [[Nobuo Sekine]].

'''New York City English''', or '''Metropolitan New York English''',&lt;ref&gt;Morén, Bruce (2000). ''Distinctiveness, Coercion and Sonority: A Unified Theory of Weight''. Routledge. p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; is a regional [[dialect]] of [[American English]] spoken by many people in [[New York City]] and much of its surrounding [[New York metropolitan area|metropolitan area]]. Described by sociolinguist [[William Labov]] as the most recognizable dialect in North America, the dialect is known through its association in the media with many public figures and fictional characters. Its features are most densely concentrated in New York City proper and its immediate suburbs (whose residents often commute to New York City), but they also extend somewhat to the wider metropolitan area and the New York City diaspora in other regions.

The dialect is widely known for its pronunciation system, the [[New York accent]], which comprises a number of both [[conservative (linguistics)|conservative]] and innovative features. Major features of the accent include a [[high vowel|high]], [[diphthong|gliding]] {{IPAc-en|ɔː}} vowel (in words like ''talk'' and ''caught''); a [[phonemic split|split]] of the "short a" vowel {{IPAc-en|æ}} into two separate sounds; variable [[rhoticity in English|dropping of ''r'' sounds]]; and a lack of the ''[[cot-caught merger|cot–caught]]'', ''[[Mary-marry-merry merger|Mary–marry–merry]]'', and ''[[hurry-furry merger|hurry–furry]]'' mergers.

==History==
The origins of New York City English are diverse, and the sources of many features are probably not recoverable. New York City English, largely with the same major pronunciation system popularly recognized today, was first reproduced in literature and also scientifically documented in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Mencken, H. L. (1919; reprinted 2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cIPoCHsgATUC&amp;dq American Language]'', 4th Edition. Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; It was then, and still mostly is, associated with ethnically diverse [[European Americans|European-American]] native-English speakers. New York City English likely evolved from an older English variety that encompassed much of the larger [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic region]], including the [[Delaware Valley]] (whose [[Mid-Atlantic American English|own dialect]] today centers around [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]), since the New York City dialect and the Delaware Valley dialectal offshoots all still share certain key features, such as a [[close vowel|high]] {{IPA|{{nobreak|/ɔː/}}}} vowel with a [[diphthong|glide]] (sometimes called the ''aww'' vowel) as well as a [[phonemic split]] of the short ''a'' vowel, {{IPA|{{nobreak|/æ/}}}} (making ''gas'' and ''gap'', for example, have different vowels sounds), though New York City's variants are still unique. Linguist [[William Labov]] has pointed out that a similarly-structured but distinct-sounding short-''a'' split, often called the [[trap–bath split]], is found today in the southern half of England, including London, and that both this short-''a'' split and the New York City's may therefore have a common ancestor originating in the nineteenth century.{{efn|{{Harvp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=173}}: "In NYC and the Mid-Atlantic region, short-a is split into a tense and lax class. There is reason to believe that the tense class /æh/ descends from the British /ah/ or 'broad-a' class."}}

New York City  became an urban economic power in the eighteenth century, with the city's financial elites maintaining close ties with the British Empire even after the Revolutionary War. According to Labov, New York speakers' [[rhoticity in English|loss of the ''r'' sound after vowels]] (which, incidentally, is not found in the nearby Delaware Valley) is thus an imitation of the [[received pronunciation|prestigious British pronunciation]], consistently starting among the upper classes in New York City in the nineteenth century before spreading to other socioeconomic classes.&lt;ref name="Labov et al., 2006, p. 47"&gt;{{Harvp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aristocratic, non-rhotic (''r''-dropping) pronunciation can be heard, for instance, in recordings of Presidents [[Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. After World War II, social perceptions reversed, and the ''r''-preserving (rhotic) pronunciation became the prestige norm throughout the whole United States; what was once the upper-class pronunciation then became perceived as more of a vernacular one, due to the loss of Britain's imperial status, the [[General American|mainstreaming]] of a more rhotic American accent that originated away from the British-influenced East Coast,&lt;ref&gt;Labov (1966/2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and widespread postwar migrations of rhotic speakers directly to New York from other regions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Sȩn, A. L. (1979). ''{{cite journal |jstor=815156 |title=Archived copy }}'', The English Journal, Vol. 68, No. 8 (Nov. 1979), pp. 52–55&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most New York City English is variably rhotic, a remnant of the older non-rhotic pronunciation.

Other vernacular pronunciations, such as the dental ''d'' and ''t'', as well as [[Th-stopping|''th''-stopping]], likely come from contact with foreign languages, particularly Italian and Yiddish, brought into New York City through its huge immigration waves of the past century and before. Grammatical structures, such as the lack of inversion in indirect questions, have the flavor of contact with immigrant languages. As stated above, many words common in the city are also derived from these foreign languages.&lt;ref&gt;Labov 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some features of traditional New York City English are receding among younger speakers, Labov concludes that, in terms of any major recent developments, the New York accent appears to be basically stable.&lt;ref name="Labov 2010"&gt;Labov, William (2010). ''[http://www.cogsci.msu.edu/DSS/2011-2012/Labov/POLC%20Chapters%201-3.pdf The Politics of Language Change: Dialect Divergence in America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006040909/http://www.cogsci.msu.edu/DSS/2011-2012/Labov/POLC%20Chapters%201-3.pdf |date=October 6, 2016 }}''. The University of Virginia Press. Pre-publication draft. p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on other dialects===
Philadelphians born in the twentieth century exhibit a short-''a'' split system that some linguists regard as a simplification of the similar New York City short-''a'' system.&lt;ref&gt;Ash, Sharon (2002). "[http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1741&amp;context=pwpl The Distribution of a Phonemic Split in the Mid-Atlantic Region: Yet More on Short ''a''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113721/http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1741&amp;context=pwpl |date=March 4, 2016 }}." University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics. University of Pennsylvania. p. 1
&lt;/ref&gt; The Philadelphia dialect is now retreating from many of the traditional features it once shared in common with New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Labov, W. &amp; Rosenfelder, I. &amp; Fruehwald, J.(2013). ''One Hundred Years of Sound Change in Philadelphia: Linear Incrementation, Reversal, and Reanalysis''. ''Language'', 89(1), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to an influx of immigrants from New York City and neighboring New Jersey to Florida, some residents of southern Florida now speak with an accent reminiscent of a New York accent. Additionally, as a result of social and commercial contact between the two cities and the influx of immigrants from the same countries,{{cn|date=August 2018}} the traditional dialect of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], known locally as "[[Yat (New Orleans)|Yat]]", bears distinctive similarities with the New York dialect, including the (moribund) [[coil–curl merger]], raising of {{IPAc-en|ɔː}} to {{IPA|[ɔə]}}, a similar split in the short-''a'' system, and [[th-stopping|''th''-stopping]]. Therefore, older New York City English presumably influenced dialect evolution in the white working class of [[New Orleans]] (and possibly vice versa), as well as in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], and [[Albany, New York]], whose older speakers today may still exhibit a short-''a'' split system that appears to be an expanded or generalized variant of the New York City short-''a'' system. Unsurprisingly, certain New York City dialect features also appear in [[New York Latino English]].

===Recent developments===
Though [[William Labov]] argues that the New York accent is generally stable at the moment,&lt;ref name="Labov 2010"/&gt; some recent studies have revealed a trend of recession in certain features of the accent, especially among younger speakers from middle-class or higher backgrounds. Documented loss of New York City accent features includes the loss of: the [[coil–curl merger]] (now almost completely extinct), non-rhoticity, and the extremely raised long vowel [ɔː] (as in ''talk'', ''cough'', or ''law''). Researchers proposed that the motivation behind these recessive trends is the stigmatization against the typical New York accent since the mid-1900s as being associated with a poorer or working-class background, often also corresponding with particular ethnic identities. While earlier projects detected trends of emphasizing New York accents as part of a process of social identification, recent researches attribute the loss of typical accent features to in-group ethnic distancing. In other words, many of the young generations of ethnic groups who formerly were the most representative speakers of the accent are currently avoiding its features in order to not stand out socially and/or ethnically.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, K. (2014). ''http://www.reed.edu/linguistics/becker/Becker_2014_BOUGHT.pdf'' {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013022927/http://www.reed.edu/linguistics/becker/Becker_2014_BOUGHT.pdf |date=October 13, 2016 }}, Language in Society, Vol. 43, No. 4, (Apr. 2014), pp. 395–420.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pronunciation==
{{main|New York accent}}
The pronunciation of New York City English, most popularly acknowledged by the term "New York accent", is readily noticed and stereotyped, garnering considerable attention in American culture.&lt;ref name="Labov et al., 2006, p. 233"&gt;Labov et al., 2006, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Some well-known phonological features include its traditional [[rhoticity in English|dropping of ''r'']], a [[/æ/ tensing|short-''a'' split system]] (in which, for example, the ''a'' in ''gas'' is not [[Assonance|assonant]] to the ''a'' in ''gap''), a [[close vowel|high]] [[diphthong|gliding]] vowel in words like ''talk'', ''thought'', ''all'', etc. (and thus an absence of the [[cot-caught merger]]),&lt;ref name="Labov et al., 2006, p. 233"/&gt; absence of the [[Mary-marry-merry merger]], and the stigmatized (and largely now-extinct) [[coil–curl merger]].&lt;ref&gt;Labov et al., 2006, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary and grammar==
{{See also| Regional vocabularies of American English}}

There are some words used mainly in Greater New York City. For instance, a "stoop" (from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''"stoep"'') is the front steps of a building. In the black and Latino communities, the word ''punk'' tends to be used as a synonym for ''weak'', ''someone unwilling or unable to defend himself'' or perhaps ''loser,'' though it appears to descend from an outdated [[African-American English]] meaning of ''male receptive participant in anal sex''.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Spears, "African American language: Ideology and so-called obscenity"; in Salikoko Mufwene, John Rickford, Guy Bailey and John Baugh (eds.) ''African American English: Structure, History, and Use'' (London: Routledge), pp. 226–250&lt;/ref&gt;

New Yorkers tend to say they stand ''on'' line, whereas most other American-English speakers tend to stand ''in'' line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/semantics-voting-you-say-line-i-say-line/321708|title=The Semantics of Voting: You Say 'On Line,' I Say 'In Line'|first=Jen|last=Doll|date=|website=theatlantic.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219093823/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/semantics-voting-you-say-line-i-say-line/321708/|archivedate=February 19, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small convenience stores are, in recent decades, often called ''bodegas,'' from the Spanish term originally meaning "a wine storehouse" via the [[Puerto Rican Spanish]] term for "small store; corner store", or ''delis,'' which is the short form of ''[[delicatessen]]s''.

==Conversational styles==

New York speakers have some unique conversational styles. Linguistic professor Deborah Tannen notes in a ''New York Times'' article it has "an emphasis to involve the other person, rather than being considerate. It would be asking questions as a show of interest in the other person, whereas in other parts of [the] country, people don't ask because it might put the person on the spot." New Yorkers "stand closer, talk louder, and leave shorter pauses between exchanges," Tannen said. "I call it 'cooperative overlap'. It's a way of showing interest and enthusiasm, but it's often mistaken for interrupting by people from elsewhere in the country." On the other hand, linguist William Labov demurs, "there's nothing known to linguists about 'normal New York City conversation'"&lt;ref&gt;John Leland, "Was it 'normal New York City conversation'?" ''New York Times'', June 9, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable speakers==
&lt;!--Because the identification of an accent is subjective, all listings here must be accompanied by citations to reliable sources describing the subject as speaking with a New York dialect/accent; uncited additions will be removed.--&gt;
The accent has a strong presence in media; pioneer [[Variation (linguistics)|variationist sociolinguist]] [[William Labov]] describes it as the most recognizable variety of [[North American English]].&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William. 1966/1996. ''The Social Stratification of English in New York City 2nd Edition''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p 18&lt;/ref&gt; The following famous people or fictional characters are often heard in public as speaking with features typical of a New York accent.  Most, but not all, are native New Yorkers. Their pronunciation and vocabulary can be useful guides to the subtleties of speaking New York.

==Geographic boundaries==

===New York State===
New York City English is confined to a geographically small but densely populated area, including all [[five boroughs]] of New York City, but not all of [[New York State]]; an entirely [[Inland Northern American English|separate dialect]] predominates in [[central New York|central]] and [[Western New York|western New York State]], especially along the [[Great Lakes region|Great Lakes]].&lt;ref name="Labov et al. 2006"/&gt; However, New York City English does extend beyond the city proper, including in western [[Long Island]] (although the boundaries there are not clearly established).&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William. 2010. Principles of Linguistic Change, V. 3: Cognitive and Cultural Factors. Cambridge/NY Cambridge University Press. Chapter 15, footnote 13. p.390 {{cite web |url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phonoatlas/PLC3/PLC3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614200507/http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phonoatlas/PLC3/PLC3.html |archivedate=June 14, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bakht, Maryam (2010) ''Lexical variation and the negotiation of linguistic style in a Long Island middle school'' unpublished doctoral dissertation NYU&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olivo, Ann Marie (2013) ''The Strong Island Sound: Sociolinguistic Evidence for Emerging American Ethnicities.'' unpublished doctoral dissertation, Rice University&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the English of the [[Hudson Valley]] forms a continuum of speakers who gather more features of New York City English the closer they are in geographic relation to the city itself;&lt;ref name="Labov et al. 2006"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of the dialect's features may be heard as far north as the city of [[Albany, New York|Albany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1353/lan.2007.0082 | last1 = Labov | first1 = William | year = 2007 | title = Transmission and Diffusion | url = http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~wlabov/Papers/TD.html | journal = [[Language (journal)|Language]] | volume = 83 | issue = 2 | pages = 344–387 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090228102652/http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~wlabov/Papers/TD.html | archivedate = February 28, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Jersey===
The [[Gateway Region|northeast quarter]] of [[New Jersey]], prominently [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen]], [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson]], and [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex]] counties, including the cities [[Weehawken, New Jersey|Weehawken]], [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]], and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]],&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William (2007) "Transmission and Diffusion", Language June 2007 p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; plus Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, are all within the [[New York City metropolitan area]] and thus also home to the major features of New York City English. With the exception of New York City's immediate neighbors like Jersey City and Newark,&lt;ref name="Labov et al., 2006, p. 47"/&gt; the New York metropolitan dialect as spoken in New Jersey is [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]] (or fully ''r''-pronouncing), so that, whereas a Brooklynite might pronounce "over there" something like "ovah theah/deah" {{IPA|[oʊvə ˈd̪ɛə]}}, an [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]] native might say "over there/dare" {{IPA|[oʊvɚ ˈd̪ɛɚ]}}. ''[[The Atlas of North American English]]'' by [[William Labov]] et al. shows that the New York City [[Phonological history of English short A|short-''a'']] pattern has diffused to many ''r''-pronouncing communities in northern New Jersey like [[Rutherford, New Jersey|Rutherford]] (Labov's birthplace) and [[North Plainfield, New Jersey|North Plainfield]]. However, in these communities, the [[function word]] constraint is lost and the [[Syllable#Structure|open syllable]] constraint is variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phonoatlas/PLC3/Ch15.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304121104/http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phonoatlas/PLC3/Ch15.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Independent Printing House CDN''' (better known as '''CDN''', {{Lang-pl|Niezależna Oficyna Wydawnicza CDN}}) was an [[Polish underground press|underground printing house]] (''bibuła'') operating in [[Poland]] between 1982 and 1990. 

Formed after the imposition of the [[Martial Law in Poland]], it focused on publishing various mostly history-related books. Apart from the modern history of Poland and [[Central Europe]], the topics included also other topics banned by the Communist censorship, including sociology and politology. The CDN also published a number of magazines and music tapes, among them a series of cassettes featuring the songs of [[Jan Krzysztof Kelus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5186">The '''Oriental Club of Philadelphia''' is one of the oldest continuously-active academic clubs in the United States. It was founded on April 30th, 1888, with the aim of "bring[ing] together those interested in the several fields of Oriental study, for the interchange of ideas, and the encouragement of Oriental research."&lt;ref&gt;''Oriental Studies: A selection of the papers read before the Oriental Club of Philadelphia, 1888-1894'' (Boston: Ginn and Co., 1894), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The club was founded by scholars and other prominent intellectuals in the [[Philadelphia]] area interested in sharing new research and archaeological findings about the cultures of South Asia, East Asia, and the Near East. Its membership was initially limited to thirty, and meetings consisted of monthly lectures, held in the houses of members.&lt;ref&gt;James David Thompson, ''Handbook of Learned Societies and Institutions: America'' (Washington, D.C.: Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1908), p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

Members in the early days of the club included some of the founding figures in American scholarship on Sanskrit, the Ancient Near East, Judaica, and the art and archaeology of Asia. Among the club's founders were [[Cyrus Adler]], Tatsui Baba, [[George Boardman the Younger|George Dana Boardman]], [[Stewart Culin]], Morton W. Easton, [[Paul Haupt]], [[Edward Washburn Hopkins]], [[Marcus Jastrow]], [[Morris Jastrow, Jr.]], [[Benjamin Smith Lyman]], Robert W. Rogers, Mayer Sulzberger, [[Henry Clay Trumbull]], and Talcott Williams.&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Kent and I. G. Matthews, “The Oriental Club of Philadelphia,” ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' 58.1 (1938), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Other early members included [[William F. Albright]], [[Robert Pierpont Blake]], [[Rhys Carpenter]], [[Franklin Edgerton]], W. Max Müller, [[E. A. Speiser]], and [[Solomon Zeitlin]].

The fifth anniversary of the Oriental Club of Philadelphia was marked by the publication of a volume of studies.&lt;ref&gt;''Oriental Studies: A selection of the papers read before the Oriental Club of Philadelphia, 1888-1894'' (Boston: Ginn and Co., 1894)&lt;/ref&gt; For the twenty-fifth anniversary of the club's foundation in 1913, it entertained the [[American Oriental Society]]. The thirty-fifth anniversary of the foundation was marked by a colloquium in 1923, the proceedings of which were published in 1924;&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Schoff, ed., ''The Song of Songs, a Symposium by members of the Oriental Club of Philadelphia'' (Philadelphia: Commercial Museum, 1924)&lt;/ref&gt; the volume features essays by Max 
L. Margolis, James A. Montgomery, Walter Woodburn Hyde, Franklin Edgerton, and Theophile J. Meek. For the fiftieth anniversary of the Oriental Club of Philadelphia in 1938, the club invited the [[American Oriental Society]] to meet in Philadelphia. In 1989, under the direction of William Hanaway, the Oriental Club of Philadelphia mounted a major conference with the participation of academic clubs from around the world. The recent history of the Oriental Club of Philadelphia was the topic for discussion at the Annual Banquet on April 25, 2001, preserved in audio on the CD “An Oral History of the Oriental Club."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theorientalclub.org/history/ http://www.theorientalclub.org/history/ - accessed 5/6/2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to the club's website, the Oriental Club of Philadelphia "continues to be a forum for the academic exchange of ideas about the literature and languages of Asia, North Africa, and the Near and Middle East. The club brings together scholars in the Philadelphia area who work on the cultures of these regions from a variety of different perspectives, including History, Art History, Anthropology, Philosophy, and Religious Studies. Members include faculty and staff of universities and museums in the Philadelphia area. Sponsored events include presentations of works-in-progress by members, an annual lecture and banquet, and public colloquia on themes of cross-cultural concern."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theorientalclub.org/past-events/ http://www.theorientalclub.org/past-events/ - accessed 5/6/2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[political movement]]s have involved their members wearing [[uniform]]s, typically as a way of showing their identity in [[marching|marches]] and [[demonstration (people)|demonstration]]s. The wearing of '''political uniforms''' has tended to be associated with [[radical politics|radical political beliefs]], typically at the [[far-right]] or [[far-left]] of politics, and can be used to imply a [[paramilitary]] type of organization.

==Prohibition==
A number of countries have legislation banning the wearing of political uniforms. Many also ban members of their police and armed forces from taking part in political activity when in uniform.

In Germany, political uniforms are forbidden.

Political uniforms were forbidden in Sweden during the period 1933-2002. The law existed to prevent Nazi groups from wearing uniforms.

In the United Kingdom, the [[Public Order Act 1936]], passed to control extremist political movements in the 1930s such as the [[British Union of Fascists]], banned the wearing of political uniforms during marches. Though this has rarely arisen in recent decades, in January 2015 the Leader of [[Britain First]] [[Paul Golding]] was convicted for wearing a political uniform. Later in November 2016 the deputy leader of [[Britain First]] [[Jayda Fransen]] was convicted for wearing a political uniform.

{{Postmodernism}}

'''Postmodern feminism''' is an approach to [[feminist theory]] that incorporates [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] and [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist theory]], seeing itself as moving beyond the [[modernist]] polarities of [[liberal feminism]] and [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 100-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminism has been seen as having an affinity to postmodern philosophy through a shared interest in [[speech act]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"The emphasis on ''practices'', which is one of the most radical powers of both postmodernism and feminism, throws renewed emphasis on speech acts and on the enacted, performative aspects of languages." E. D. Ermarth, ''Sequel to History'' (1992) p. 172-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and theory ==

===Butler===
Postmodern feminism's major departure from other branches of feminism is perhaps the argument that [[sex]], or at least [[gender]] is itself [[social construction|constructed]] through [[discourse|language]], a view notably propounded in [[Judith Butler]]'s 1990 book, ''[[Gender Trouble]]''. She draws on and critiques the work of [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Jacques Lacan]], as well as on [[Luce Irigaray]]'s argument that what we conventionally regard as 'feminine' is only a reflection of what is constructed as masculine.&lt;ref&gt;G. Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2002) p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler criticises the distinction drawn by previous feminisms between (biological) sex and (socially constructed) [[gender]]. She asks why we assume that material things (such as the body) are not subject to processes of social construction themselves. Butler argues that this does not allow for a sufficient criticism of [[essentialism]]: though recognizing that gender is a social construct, feminists assume it is always constructed in the same way. Her argument implies that [[women]]'s subordination has no single cause or single solution; postmodern feminism is thus criticized for offering no clear path to action.  Butler herself rejects the term "postmodernism" as too vague to be meaningful.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Butler, "Contingent Foundations" in Seyla Benhabib et al., ''Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange'' (New York: Routledge, 1995), pp. 35-58&lt;/ref&gt;

Paula Moya argues that Butler derives this rejection to postmodernism from misreadings of [[Cherríe Moraga]]'s work. "She reads Moraga's statement that 'the danger lies in ranking the oppressions' to mean that we have no way of adjudicating among different kinds of oppressions—that any attempt to casually relate or hierarchize the varieties of oppressions people suffer constitutes an imperializing, colonizing, or totalizing gesture that renders the effort invalid…thus, although Butler at first appears to have understood the critiques of women who have been historically precluded from occupying the position of the 'subject' of feminism, it becomes clear that their voices have been merely instrumental to her" (Moya, 790) Moya contends that because Butler feels that the varieties of oppressions cannot be summarily ranked, that they cannot be ranked at all; and takes a short-cut by throwing out the idea of not only postmodernism, but women in general.&lt;ref&gt;Moya, Paula M.L. ''From Postmodernism, 'Realism,' and the Politics of Identity: [[Cherríe Moraga]] and [[Chicana feminism|Chicana Feminism]]'' in {{cite book | last1 = Gilbert | first1 = Susan M. | last2 = Gubar | first2 = Susan Eds | title=Feminist literary theory and criticism : a Norton reader | year = 2007 | publisher = W.W. Norton | location = New York | isbn=9780393927900 | pages = 787–797 | edition = 1st | authorlink=From Postmodernism, "Realism," and the Politics of Identity: Cherrie Morage and Chicana Feminism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frug===
Although [[postmodernism]] resists characterization, it is possible to identify certain themes or orientations that postmodern feminists share. [[Mary Joe Frug]] suggested that one "principle" of postmodernism is that human experience is located "inescapably within language".  Power is exercised not only through direct coercion, but also through the way in which language shapes and restricts our reality. However, because language is always open to re-interpretation, it can also be used to resist this shaping and restriction, and so is a potentially fruitful site of political struggle.

Frug's second postmodern principle is that sex is not something natural, nor is it something completely determinate and definable. Rather, sex is part of a system of meaning, produced by language. Frug argues that "cultural mechanisms ... encode the female body with meanings", and that these cultural mechanisms then go on explain these meanings "by an appeal to the 'natural' differences between the sexes, differences that the rules themselves help to produce".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Joe Frug, "A Postmodern Feminist Legal Manifesto (An Unfinished Draft)," ''Harvard Law Review'', Vol. 105, No. 5. (Mar., 1992), pp. 1045-1075, at p. 1049.&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting the idea of a natural basis to sexual difference allows us to see that it is always susceptible to new interpretations. Like other systems of meaning, it is less like a cage, and more like a tool: it constrains but never completely determines what one can do with it.

===French feminism===
[[French feminism]] from the 1970s onwards has forged specific routes in postmodern feminism and in feminist [[psychoanalysis]], through such writers as [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Hélène Cixous]].

Cixous argued for a new form of writing, writing with the body—a kind of writing rooted not in biology but in linguistic change.&lt;ref&gt;Ermath, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Irigaray considered that "man would search, with nostalgia and repulsion, in woman for his own repressed and uncultivated natural pole"—something which would "prevent woman from truly being an other for him".&lt;ref&gt;Luce Irigaray, ''Sharing the World'' (2008) p. 33-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Kristeva argued that 'woman' does not exist, but is rather in a state of becoming.&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toril Moi]] has stressed that issues of [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]] as well as of femininity are central to the concerns of all the above writers.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentz eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bornstein===
[[Kate Bornstein]], transgender author and playwright, calls herself a [[postmodernism|postmodern feminist]].

== Critiques ==

Critics like [[Meaghan Morris]] have argued that postmodern feminism runs the risk of undercutting the basis of a politics of action based upon gender difference, through its very anti-essentialism.&lt;ref&gt;K. Schmidt, ''The Theatre of Transformation'' (2005) p. 129-30&lt;/ref&gt;

"One of the most appealing aspects of postmodernism to many feminists has been its focus on difference. The notion that women have been created and defined as 'other' by men has long been argued and explored by feminists, most notably Simone de Beauvoir. She challenged male definitions of woman and called on women to define themselves outside the male female dyad. Women, she urged, must be the subject rather than the object (other) of analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parpart|first=Jane|title=Who Is the 'Other'?: A Postmodern Feminist Critique of Women and Development Theory and Practice|journal=Development and Change|date=22 October 2008|volume=24|issue=3|pages=439–464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist Moya Lloyd adds that a postmodernist feminism "does not necessarily represent a post-feminism, but alternatively, can affirm feminist politics in their plural, multivocal, fluid, oft-changing hue"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parpart|first=Jane|title=Who is the 'Other'?: A Postmodern Feminist Critique of Women and Development Theory and Practice|journal=Development and Change|date=22 October 2008|volume=24|issue=3|pages=439–464|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7660.1993.tb00492.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-structuralism is defined in the Penguin Reference, Dictionary of Literary Terms &amp; Literary Theory, as "... a more rigorous working out of the possibilities, implications and shortcomings of structuralism and its basis to Saussurean linguistics itself... . Post-structuralism doubts the adequacy of structuralism and, as far as literature is concerned, tends to reveal that the meaning of any text is, of its nature, unstable. It reveals that signification is, of its nature, unstable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J.A.|title=The Penguin dictionary of literary terms and literary theory|year=1998|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780140513639|pages=689–693|edition=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Post-structuralism, pursues further the Saussurean perception that in language there are only differences without positive terms and shows that the signifier and signified are, as it were, not only oppositional, but plural, pulling against each other, and, by so doing, creating numerous deferments of meaning, apparently endless criss-crossing patterns in sequences of meaning. In short, what are called 'disseminations.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J.A.|title=The Penguin dictionary of literary terms and literary theory|year=1998|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780140513639|pages=689–693|edition=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gloria Steinem]] has [[Gloria Steinem#Feminist theory|criticized feminist theory]], and especially postmodernist feminist theory, as being overly academic, "I always wanted to put a sign up on the road to Yale saying, 'Beware: Deconstruction Ahead'. Academics are forced to write in language no one can understand so that they get tenure. They have to say 'discourse', not 'talk'. Knowledge that is not accessible is not helpful. It becomes aerialised."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Percival David Collection DSCF3122 17.jpg|thumb|[[Longquan celadon]] vase, 14th century; the unglazed medallions were coated with a resist before the vase was coated with liquid glaze.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3179870&amp;partId=1 British Museum page]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''resist''', used in many areas of manufacturing and art, is something that is added to parts of an object to create a pattern by protecting these parts from being affected by a subsequent stage in the process.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Resist", 3. "Any composition applied to a surface to protect it in part from the effects of an agent employed on it for some purpose".&lt;/ref&gt; Often the resist is then removed.  For example in the [[resist dyeing]] of textiles, wax or a similar substance is added to places where the dye is not wanted. The wax will "resist" the dye, and after it is removed there will be a pattern in two colours.  [[Batik]], ''[[shibori]]''  and [[tie-dye]] are among many styles of resist dyeing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/r/resist-dyed-textiles/ Resist-dyed textiles], Victoria and Albert Museum, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoshiko Iwamoto Wada]], Mary Kellogg Rice, Jane Barton, ''Shibori: The Inventive Art of Japanese Shaped Resist Dyeing : Tradition, Techniques, Innovation'', 1999, Kodansha International, {{ISBN|4770023995}}, 9784770023995&lt;/ref&gt;  

Wax or grease can also be used as a resist in pottery, to keep some areas free from a [[ceramic glaze]]; the wax burns away when the piece is fired.&lt;ref&gt;Medley, Margaret, ''The Chinese Potter: A Practical History of Chinese Ceramics'', pp. 151–152, 3rd edition, 1989, Phaidon, {{ISBN|071482593X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Song dynasty]] [[Jizhou ware]] used paper cut-outs and leaves as resists or stencils under glaze to create patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Medley, pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt;  Other uses of resists in pottery work with [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] or paints, and a whole range of modern materials used as resists.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, Peter, ''Resist and Masking Techniques'' (Ceramics Handbooks), 1996, University of Pennsylvania Press, 
{{ISBN|0812216113}}, 9780812216110&lt;/ref&gt;  A range of similar techniques can be used in [[watercolour]] and other forms of painting.&lt;ref&gt;Reyner, Nancy, ''Acrylic Revolution: New Tricks and Techniques for Working with the World's Most Versatile Medium'', pp. 40–42, 2007, North Light Books, {{ISBN|1581808046}}, 9781581808049, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w0N_wjD3TBMC&amp;pg=PA40 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Crabtree, Peter Beudert, ''Scenic Art for the Theatre: History, Tools and Techniques'', p. 391, 2012, CRC Press, {{ISBN|1136084304}}, 9781136084300&lt;/ref&gt;  While these artistic techniques stretch back centuries, a range of new applications of the resist principle have recently developed in [[microelectronics]] and [[nanotechnology]]. An example is [[Resist (semiconductor fabrication)|resists in semiconductor fabrication]], using [[photoresist]]s (often just referred to as "resists") in [[photolithography]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Widmann, H. Mader, H. Friedrich, ''Technology of Integrated Circuits'', pp. 92–115, 2013, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, {{ISBN|366204160X}}, 9783662041604, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nC7wCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA112 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Etching]] processes use a resist, though in these typically the whole object is covered in the resist (called the "ground" in some contexts), which is then selectively removed from some parts. This is the case when a resist is used to prepare the copper substrate for [[champlevé]] [[vitreous enamel|enamel]]s, where parts of the field are etched (with [[acid]] or electrically) into hollows to be filled with powdered glass, which is then melted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jackson |first1=R. L. |title=Relief Electro-Etching for Champlevé Enamelling |url=http://www.guildofenamellers.org/index.php/component/phocadownload/category/1-technical-documents?download=4:relief-electro-etching |publisher=Guild of Enamellers |accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[chemical milling]], as many forms of industrial etching are called, the resist may be referred to as the "maskant",&lt;ref&gt;[http://osp.mans.edu.eg/s-hazem/NTM/NTCM.html Nontraditional Chemical Processes]&lt;/ref&gt; and in many contexts the process may be known as [[Masking (in art)|masking]].  A fixed resist pre-shaped with the pattern is often called a [[stencil]], or in some contexts a [[frisket]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Guild Handbook of Scientific Illustration'', ed. Elaine R. S. Hodges, 2003, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0471360112}}, 9780471360117, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gD8pWkA6TcwC&amp;pg=PA194 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] does not record the word "resist" in this sense before the 1830s, when it was used in relation to both "[[calico]]-printing" (1836) and metalwork with copper (1839).&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Resist", 2. and 3. (original edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Resists were also used to etch steel from the mid 19th-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael R.

'''Rignano Flaminio''' is a ''[[comune]]'' (municipality) in the [[Metropolitan City of Rome]] in the [[Italy|Italian]] region [[Latium]],  about {{convert|35|km|mi}} north of [[Rome]]. It is across the [[Via Flaminia]].

Rignano Flaminio borders the municipalities of [[Calcata]], [[Capena]], [[Civitella San Paolo]], [[Faleria]], [[Magliano Romano]], [[Morlupo]], and [[Sant'Oreste]].

It has a station on the [[Ferrovia Roma-Viterbo|Roma-Viterbo]] railway.

==History==
Agricultural settlements of the [[Capenati]] and [[Falisci]] in the area are attested from the 5th or 4th centuries BC. In the 6th century AD a popular pilgrimage church, entitled to St. Abondius and Abondantius, was created here; the saints' relics were moved to Rome, on the [[Tiber Island]], in 999. In 1159 [[Pope Adrian IV]] died at Rignano.

Rignano was first a possession of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] and then of the [[Savelli family]], who were shortly ousted by [[Pope Alexander VI]]. After the fall of the [[Borgia]], the Savelli regained it and held the fief until 1607, when they sold it to the [[Borghese]]. It later passed to the Muti, the Cesi and the Massimo families.

{{History of Korea|Small=Yes}}

'''Songguk-ri''' ({{IPA-ko|soŋ.ɡuŋ.ni}}) is a Middle and Late [[Mumun]]-period (c. 850–300 B.C.) archaeological site in [[Buyeo County|Buyeo-gun]], [[Chungcheongnam-do]], [[South Korea]]. Songguk-ri is a settlement and burial site that is important in the study of Korean [[prehistory]]. It is registered as Historical Site No. 249. Songguk-ri is a main point of reference in Korean prehistory—Korean archaeologists have represented the prehistoric village and the material culture excavated from there as the [[type-site]] for Middle Mumun Culture in southern Korea.

==History of Excavations==
[[Image:Korea-Bronze.age-Daggers-02.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Artifacts excavated from a stone cist burial at Songguk-ri]]
Excavations began there in 1975 and Songguk-ri was one of the first archaeological sites in South Korea to yield [[bronze]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], large tubular [[jade|greenstone]] beads, and [[pit-house]]s with rounded plan-shapes. Rounded pit-houses similar with those of Songguk-ri were later found at other archaeological sites along with a suite of other co-occurring artifacts prompting archaeologists to use Songguk-ri as the type site for Middle Mumun culture and label features and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] from there and other Middle Mumun sites as 'Songguk-ri Style'. In particular, the term ''Songguk-ri''-style pit-house is the typological name given to Middle Mumun Period dwellings in southern Korea. The site has been excavated a number of times by branches of the [[National Museum of Korea]] (Buyeo National Museum 2000; [[National Museum of Korea]] 1979, 1986, 1987).

Groups of pit-houses are found in various spots in an area of almost 100,000&amp;nbsp;km². Forty-four pit-houses were excavated at Songguk-ri (O 1997). Pottery that is typically found in the Late Middle Mumun (c.&amp;nbsp;700–550 B.C.) was unearthed from the pit-houses, but some pit-houses may date to the Late Mumun. Evidence of an imposing [[palisade]] erected around one of the residential precincts at the site has been found, leading archaeologists to hypothesize about conflict and competition in the local Mumun society. A number of smaller settlements from the same time period are found within several kilometres of Songguk-ri.

The site also contains a high status stone-cist burial with a Liaoning-style bronze [[dagger]], a number of large tubular-shaped greenstone ornaments, and a finely-made [[groundstone]] dagger. A number of jar-burials have been unearthed from the site.

==Significance of Songguk-ri in Korean Prehistory and Formation of Early Korean States==
Songguk-ri was likely part of the central settlement distributed amongst smaller settlements in the Seokseong-cheon River valley that briefly formed a simple [[chiefdom]] for approximately one or two generations in the Middle [[Mumun]]. Songguk-ri is one of the well-known sites from Korean prehistory that displays some formative examples of characteristics of [[Samhan|Protohistoric]] chiefdoms such as [[Mahan confederacy|Mahan]], [[Byeonhan]], and early states such as [[Baekje]]. For example, Songguk-ri contains evidence of several long-term trends in Korean [[prehistory]] and protohistory such as the existence of social status distinctions and the use of prestige artifacts such as [[jade|greenstone]] and metal (e.g. Liaoning-style bronze dagger) in burials. It is thus that Songguk-ri and other such prehistoric sites of a similar age (e.g. [[Igeum-dong]], [[Daepyeong]], etc.) are referred to when we begin the discussion regarding the origins of social complexity and the formation of states in the [[Korean peninsula]].

'''Testosterone poisoning''' is a pejorative metaphor for [[stereotypically]] male behavior. Various authors have used the phrase to criticize [[aggression]] in men, including [[war]]. The concept of ''testosterone poisoning'' is based on the association of masculinity with harmful behaviors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bigthink.com/Mind-Matters/testosterone-poisoning-isnt-what-you-think|title=Testosterone Poisoning Isn't What You Think|date=2009-12-09|work=Big Think|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;; for example, from 1980 to 2008 males were convicted of the vast majority of [[homicide]]s in the United States, representing 90.5% of the total number of offenders.&lt;ref name="bjs.gov"&gt;[http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf "Homicide Trends in the United States, 1980-2008"] [[United States Department of Justice]] (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The term capitalizes on the perception that [[masculinity]] is controlled by the hormone [[testosterone]].

==Origins==

An early printed reference to "testosterone poisoning" came in 1975 from actor [[Alan Alda]]. In a parody of self-help writing, Alda diagnoses the "ailment" of masculinity and offers methods for its "cure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Rainbolt |editor1-first=Martha |editor2-last=Fleetwood |editor2-first=Janet |title=On the Contrary: Essays by Men and Women |date=1984 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-87-395720-5 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6vrqg7dEyvUC&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes:

{{quote|Everyone knows that testosterone, the so-called male hormone, is found in both men and women. What is not so well known, is that men have an overdose... Until recently it has been thought that the level of testosterone in men is normal simply because they have it. But if you consider how abnormal their ''behavior'' is, then you are led to the hypothesis that almost all men are suffering from ''testosterone poisoning''.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Alda, "What Every Woman Should Know About Men", Ms., New York, October 1975&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ten years later, that same sentence from Alda's article was quoted in the 1985 book ''A Feminist Dictionary''.&lt;ref&gt;''A Feminist Dictionary'', ed. Kramarae and Treichler, Pandora Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Sagan]] gave the phrase more publicity when he praised [[Moondance magazine]] writer [[Daniela Gioseffi]]'s [[American Book Award]] winner ''Women on War'':

{{quote|A book of searing analysis and cries from the heart on the madness of war. Why is the half of humanity with a special sensitivity to the preciousness of life, the half untainted by testosterone poisoning, almost wholly unrepresented in defense establishments and peace negotiations worldwide?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italianamericanwriters.com/womenonwar.html Women On War], Daniela Gioseffi.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some took offense at this phrase. A ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' [[op-ed]] piece referred to Professor Sagan's use directly:

{{quote|[[Carl Sagan]] even pompously informs us that the whole planet is imminently endangered by "testosterone poisoning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Patrick M. Arnold|title=In Academe, Misogyny Meets Its Match: Misandrosy : Behavior: The uproar at Mills College illustrates a nasty new trend: man-hating. What parent would send a son into such an environment?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-14/local/me-2_1_mills-college|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=7 March 2015|date=14 May 1990|quote=It is the shadow side of the extreme feminist movement, an ideology of hate whose name is not yet found in the dictionary. I term it misandrosy (Greek: "hatred of men"), the mirror opposite of misogyny. Misandrosy, not yet as widespread or harmful as misogyny but not yet as well recognized, either, is beginning to show itself mainly in liberal circles in the arts, literature, religion, media and academia. [...] [[Carl Sagan]] even pompously informs us that the whole planet is imminently endangered by "testosterone poisoning."}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bruce Tremper used the term in ''The Avalanche Review'', stating that being "a man" is best proven by dying "a stupendously violent death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avalanche.org/~moonstone/TAR/Human%20Being.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051108105305/http://www.avalanche.org/~moonstone/TAR/Human%20Being.htm |archivedate=2005-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elaine Weiss writes in ''Family and Friends' Guide to Domestic Violence'' that "deadly testosterone poisoning" (DTP) is one of "many misunderstandings about abusive men". She continues: "this is not a war of the hormones, an inevitable biological clash between estrogen and testosterone. If it were, then there would be more of it; every heterosexual relationship would be abusive".&lt;ref name="Weiss"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weiss |first1=Elaine |title=Family &amp; Friends' Guide to Domestic Violence: How to Listen, Talk, and Take Action when Someone You Care about is Being Abused |date=2003 |publisher=Volcano Press |isbn=978-1-88-424422-3 |page=47 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FQlgRiO4anwC&amp;pg=PA47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1996 ''[[Psychology Today]]'' article refers to the phrase as "only a joke," but notes, in reference to several studies about testosterone and male [[employment]], that testosterone levels were lower for successful new male employees at a southern U.S. oil firm.&lt;ref name="Doskoch"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Doskoch |first1=Peter |title=The Trouble with Testosterone |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199612/the-trouble-testosterone |work=Psychology Today |date=December 1996 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130131202132/http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19961201-000021.html |archivedate=31 January 2013 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mazur ''et al.'' (1998) stated that males with higher testosterone levels tend to be slightly more aggressive, and argue that this appears to be due to the way acting aggressively raises testosterone levels rather than the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;Mazur, A. &amp; Booth, A. (1998) Testosterone and dominance in men. ''Behavioral &amp; Brain Sciences'' 21:353--397.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Berenbaum ''et al.'' (1997) stated that exposure to high levels of [[androgens]] [[Gestation|''in utero'']] are associated with higher levels of adult aggression (Reinisch, 1981;&lt;ref&gt;Reinisch, J.M (1981) Prenatal exposure to synthetic progestins increases potential for aggression in humans. ''Science'' 211:1171--1173.&lt;/ref&gt; Berenbaum &amp; Reinisch, 1997&lt;ref&gt;Berenbaum, S.A. &amp; Reinisch, J.M. (1997) Early androgen effects on aggression in children and adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia ''Psychoneuroendocrinology'' 22:505--515.&lt;/ref&gt;).

McDermott (2007) found a significant positive relationship between levels of testosterone and aggression.&lt;ref&gt;McDermott, R. (2007) "Testosterone and Aggression in a Simulated Crisis Game" The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol. 614, No. 1, 15-33.(2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

References to ''testosterone poisoning'' are often used to criticize men.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}  Magazine editor [[Tina Brown]] uses the phrase thematically in a 2005 ''[[Washington Post]]'' essay about the downfall of [[Harvard University]] president [[Larry Summers]] and the problems of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s former embattled CEO [[Michael Eisner]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A48436-2005Feb23.html "Why Can't a Man Be More Like a Woman?"] by Tina Brown, ''The Washington Post,'' Feb. 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beth Gallagher's ''[[Salon.com]]'' essay "Road Sows" about the drawbacks of [[sports utility vehicle]]s describes those vehicles' growing popularity as having spread beyond testosterone poisoned men to [[soccer moms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2000/05/24/road_sow/email.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113040943/http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2000/05/24/road_sow/email.html |archivedate=2007-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. [[Karl Albrecht]] makes testosterone poisoning a synonym for [[male chauvinism]] in his 2002 book ''The Power of Minds at Work: Organizational Intelligence in Action'' where he describes it as one of 17 basic syndromes of [[:wikt:dysfunction|dysfunction]].&lt;ref&gt;http://karlalbrecht.com/articles/17syndromes.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally this perceived moral decadence of men turns against women, as in [[Kay S. Hymowitz]]'s sarcastic reference to Western [[Feminism|feminists]] in a 2003 ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' essay chiding them for neglecting the rights of [[Third World]] women in [[Muslim]] countries:

{{quote|There is no need, in their minds, to distinguish between [[Osama bin Laden|Osama]], [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam]], and [[George W. Bush|Bush]]: They're all suffering from testosterone poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/_wsj-the_women_feminists.htm "The Women Feminists Forgot"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011104108/http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/_wsj-the_women_feminists.htm |date=2013-10-11 }}, by Kay S. Hymowitz, ''The Wall Street Journal,'' Mar. 7, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several readers submitted "testosterone poisoning" to a 2001 ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' competition to find a male equivalent for [[hysteria]] (which was originally regarded as a female-only condition).&lt;ref&gt;The Atlantic, [https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2001/06/fugitives.htm Word Fugitives], Barbara Wallraff, June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[National Public Radio|National Public Radio's]]'' popular show "[[Car Talk]]" has used the term repeatedly.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20040607073548/http://www.cartalk.com/content/features/Summer-Driving-Tips/other.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Criticism section|date=September 2017}} 

Antonia Feitz has protested the use of the expression in a 1999 essay in the ''Australian Daily Issues Paper,'' calling it [[hate speech]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwb.com.au/gwb/news/feitz/f0502.htm "Demonizing Men"], by Antonia Feitz, ''The Australian Daily View'', Feb. 9, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
Neuroscientist Christoph Eisenegger at the [[University of Zurich]] has conducted a study and concludes that the evidence debunks the myth that testosterone causes aggressive, egocentric behaviour, suggesting instead that the sex hormone can encourage fair play, particularly if it improves a person's status.&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life/spirituality/self-help/Testosterone-leads-to-fairness-not-aggression/articleshow/5318244.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study published in ''Nature'', "a single dose of testosterone in women causes a substantial increase in fair bargaining behaviour, thereby reducing bargaining conflicts and increasing the efficiency of social interactions. However, subjects who believed that they received testosterone—regardless of whether they actually received it or not—behaved much more unfairly than those who believed that they were treated with placebo."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7279/full/nature08711.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urban iconography''' is a branch of [[iconography]], a term used both extensively, to mean a collection of illustrations of a specific subject and, within [[art history]], the study of the subject matter of figurative representations. [[Iconology]] is more specifically concerned with the interpretation of the same subject matter. According to [[Erwin Panofsky]] iconography aims to identify the primary and  secondary subject matter, and therefore  “in doing so, iconography is an invaluable help for the establishment of dates, provenance and, occasionally, authenticity; and it furnishes  the necessary basis for all further interpretation”.
Urban iconography is focused on the city, a complex and dynamic artifact,whose forms are a transparent medium of social ideas, individual and collective needs,like dwelling or gathering for religious, economic or political purposes, needs to which different societies gave different answers.
To interpret town images correctly, it  is necessary to understand the urban mechanisms of evolution, as well as urban culture. On the other hand, the image itself is part of the wider history of figurative handcrafts, and therefore. deciphering its representative code is essential to guarantee a proper interpretation and a proper use.

==Urban iconography as a methodology for research==
The study of urban iconography developed in the last thirty years indifferent contexts, but mainly inside studies in urban history, among which it appeared as one of the most innovative approaches. After the exploration and the surveys of the iconography of single towns, research shifted to methodology, language, techniques, instruments, the relationship between word and image and between material structure and representation. Promising research fields are opening up through the use of computer data processing, and the comparative study on the representation of urban space seems to be one of the next frontiers.
Town representation is no longer studied as source material for the study of urban history, but become a research field in itself, one that has to find its proper place in the history of culture .

==Foundations of Urban Iconography==
Collections of images of single towns began to appear the beginning of  the twentieth century, but more recently urban iconography has been recognized as a methodology of research. After the publication of the "Atlante" ( ''Storia d'Italia'' series, Einaudi, Turin, 1976)  and the launching of the series "Le città nella storia d'Italia" (Bari, Laterza, 1980) aimed at investigating the relationship between towns developments and their iconography, research took new directions. The subject has been discussed in conferences and round tables, the proceedings of some of which are now available.&lt;ref&gt;''L’immagine della città europea in età di antico regime'',Napoli 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Iconografia della Città Europee dal XV al XIX secolo'',Napoli 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The representation of lansdcape in the 17th century'',Utrecht 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''L’iconografia delle città spagnole dal XV al XIX secolo'',Napoli 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Le paysage des cartes.Genèse d'une codification'',Parigi 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''L'iconografia delle città europee dal XV al XIX secolo'',Napoli 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Imago urbis'',Bologna 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''L'image peinte de la Ville.XVe-XVIIIe siècle Italie-Europe'',Roma 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''L'iconografia delle città europee dal XV al XIX secolo'', Napoli 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mapmaker's Vision,Beholder's Eyes:The Art of Maps'',Arlington TX 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''L'iconografia delle città europee dal XV al XIX secolo'', Napoli 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Icone urbane'', Macerata 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''L'iconografia delle città svizzere e tedesche nel contesto europeo: dai prototipi alla fotografia'', Napoli 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Piante di Roma del Rinascimento e della Controriforma(1551-1625)'', Roma 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Le piante di Roma. La città dal Barocco ai Catasti. Architettura, arte e scienza'', Roma 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''El poder de la imagen: retratos de la ciudad barroca'', Siviglia 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
Papers focused on urban iconography were presented in sessions of the biennial "International Conferences on the History of Cartography"
(http://www.maphistory.info/ichcintro.html).
Many medium-sized cities began to encourage catalogues of their own iconography, and  museum exhibitions, that were sometimes extended to wider contexts and accompanied by rich catalogues &lt;ref&gt;''Firenze e la sua immagine. Cinque secoli di vedutismo'', Firenze 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''L’immagine della città italiana dal XVI al XIX secolo', Napoli 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A volo d'uccello.

Images de Bruxelles et de l'ancient duché de Brabant'', Bruxelles 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Segni e sogni della terra'', Milano 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Imago urbis Romae'', Roma 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Nolli Vasi Piranesi'', Roma 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Magnificent maps: power, propaganda and art'', London 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''La Sala Bologna nei Palazzi Vaticani.

'''''Veto Players: How Political Institutions Work''''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7419.html Tsebelis, G.: Veto Players: How Political Institutions Work&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is a book written by [[political science]] professor [[George Tsebelis]] in 2002. It is a [[game theory]] analysis of political behavior. In this work Tsebelis uses the concept of the [[veto player]] as a tool for analysing the outcomes of political systems. His primary focus is on legislative behaviour and outcomes.

== Veto players ==

The concept of the [[veto]] player is a political actor who has the ability to decline a choice being made. Specifically in Tsebelis' analysis a veto player is one who can stop a change from the status quo. This is analogous to players in a bargaining game where all players must reach agreement.

A key feature of veto players is that they have preferences over public policy outcomes and these are continuous across the continuous policy choices the veto player faces.

There are a number of difficulties with applying the concept of veto players to political systems:

*What is a veto? Although from a game theoretic perspective it is often part of the conditions of the game that agreement must be reached, in practice determining what constitutes a veto is more difficult. For example, although the US president is said to have a veto over legislation, in fact this can be overturned by the legislature. More strikingly, traditionally the British monarch has a veto over legislation (as British Acts require Royal Assent) but this power is never used.
*What is a player? Tsebelis notes that players come in a variety of forms, and may be groups. It may be the case that the veto player is not an individual, for example the US congress. In this case how can the veto player be defined? One way is to look at the constitutional structure of the assembly (the majority of the preferences of the House) however this overlooks the influence of parties and external influences of the lobby groups and the electorate. Tsebslis looks at this by assessing the influence of the different factors on the veto player preferences, arguing that the veto player analysis encompasses issues such as party systems.

== Policy space and social choice within ==

Having established the concept of veto players, Tsebelis then applies this to social choice, following [[Anthony Downs]]' approach of continuous policy space with veto players concerned solely about proximilty of choices to their ideal on a policy spectrum. Further he assumes that there is a status quo point (apparently analogous to a disagreement point in game theoretic bargaining analysis).

He argues that the status quo will only change if it is weakly preferred by all veto players (since otherwise one of the players would veto the social choice). This is analogous to saying that the status quo will only change if the status quo is not [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto efficient]] for veto players. Tsebelis then suggests that where Pareto improvements are available, the social choice will be for a point which is Pareto efficient. He suggests that in the case where there are many such points, there will be mechanisms to determine which point is reached (although there is no explicit exposition of a bargaining analysis either co-operative or non-cooperative).

Tsebelis then looks at how various veto players resolve certain situation (changing the number of policy dimensions, veto players and status quo points). In so doing he looks at situations with many solutions.
