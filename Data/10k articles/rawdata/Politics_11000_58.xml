The '''3C-model''' of motivation („3C“ stands for the „three components of motivation“) was developed by Professor [[Hugo Kehr|Hugo M. Kehr]], PhD., at UC Berkeley.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Kehr, H. M. (2004a). Integrating implicit motives, explicit motives, and perceived abilities: The compensatory model of work motivation and volition. ''Academy of Management Review, 29''(3), 479–499.&lt;/ref&gt; The 3C-model is an integrative, empirically validated theory of motivation that can be used for systematic motivation diagnosis and intervention.

== Main assumptions ==

=== The three components head, heart and hand ===
“3C” stands for the three components of motivation, which can be illustrated as three partially overlapping circles (see Fig. 1). In psychological terminology, the three components are explicit (self-attributed) motives, implicit (unconscious) motives, and perceived abilities. For practical applications, the metaphor “head”, “heart” and “hand”, which goes back to [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]], is being used.
* '''Head''' represents our rationally derived intentions, our goals and the commitment to enact a certain action.
* '''Heart''' represents the emotional sphere; the fun and pleasure associated with an activity; unconscious needs and motives, but also fears and bellyaches underlying an activity.
* '''Hand''' represents skills and abilities, action-related knowledge and experiences with respect to the activity at hand.
[[File:3C-model Fig1.jpg|thumb|450x450px|right|Fig. 1. Illustration of the three components of the 3C-model head, heart and hand.]]

=== Interplay of the three components ===
Fulfilment of the components head and heart results in intrinsic motivation: The person is fully concentrated and likes to perform the activity at hand. Hereby, it does not matter whether the component hand is also fulfilled: Skills and abilities are not a prerequisite for intrinsic motivation.

Optimal motivation results from all three components being fulfilled (represented by the overlap section of the three circles in Figure 1). Here, the person is intrinsically motivated and also has all the skills and abilities needed. This situation is associated with the experience of [[Flow (Psychology)|flow]]. However, if one of the two components head or heart is not fulfilled (i.e., the person is lacking cognitive support for the activity or he or she experiences unpleasant belly-aches), the person will struggle when performing the activity. This situation may be experienced as “demotivation”. Here, willpower ([[Volition (psychology)|volition]]) is needed in order to perform the activity and suppress aversion or doubt. Volitional self-control can be momentarily successful – but it also induces a loss of energy and can, in the long run, lead to over-control and health problems.

Two kinds of volition need to be distinguished:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kehr, H. M. (2004b). Implicit/explicit motive discrepancies and volitional depletion among managers. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 30''(3), 315–327. doi:10.1177/0146167203256967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kehr, H. M. (2014). Das 3K-Modell der Motivation. In J. Felfe (Ed.), ''Psychologie für das Personalmanagement: Vol. 27. Trends der psychologischen Führungsforschung. Neue Konzepte, Methoden und Erkenntnisse'' (pp. 103–116). Göttingen: Hogrefe.&lt;/ref&gt; Volition Type 1 is needed for tasks which are supported by the head but lack support from the heart. This is the case, for instance, when important, but aversive tasks need to be fulfilled. Volition Type 2 is needed for tasks that are supported by the heart but not the head; such situations may be experienced as temptation or fear.

Lacking support by the component hand requires problem-solving mechanisms to compensate one’s lacking skills and abilities, for instance by asking others for help.

== Application of the 3C-Model ==
In practical application, for instance in self-management,&lt;ref&gt;Kehr, H. M. (2008). ''Authentisches Selbstmanagement: Übungen zur Steigerung von Motivation und Willensstärke''. Beltz-Taschenbuch: Vol. 622. Weinheim: Beltz.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kehr, H. M., &amp; Von Rosenstiel, L. (2006). Self-Management Training (SMT): Theoretical and empirical foundations for the development of a metamotivational and metavolitional intervention program. In D. H. Frey, H. Mandl, &amp; L. von Rosenstiel (Eds.), ''Knowledge and action'' (pp. 103–141). Cambridge, MA: Huber &amp; Hogrefe.&lt;/ref&gt; in coaching,&lt;ref&gt;Strasser, M., &amp; Kehr, H. M. (2012). Motivation gezielt fördern. ''Coaching-Magazin'', 13(1), 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt; in leadership training,&lt;ref&gt;Kehr, H. M. (2011). Führung durch Motivation: Implizite Motive, explizite Ziele und die Steigerung der Willenskraft. ''Personalführung'', ''4'', 66–71.&lt;/ref&gt; or in change management,&lt;ref&gt;Kehr, H. M., &amp; Rawolle, M. (2009). Kopf, Bauch und Hand – wie Motivation Veränderungsprozesse unterstützt. ''Wirtschaftspsychologie aktuell'', ''2'', 23–26.&lt;/ref&gt; the 3C-model can be used for systematic diagnosis of motivation deficits and intervention.
[[File:3C-model Fig2.jpg|thumb|450x450px|right|Fig. 2. Practical application of the 3C-model: Motivation diagnosis (e.g. of a team member/ an employee).]]

=== Motivation diagnosis ===
For diagnostical purposes, fulfillment of the three components of motivation can be assessed with the so-called 3C-check. The following questions can be used (see Figure 2):
* '''Head''': „Is this activity really important to me?“
* '''Heart''': „Do I really like this acticvity?“
* '''Hand''': „Am I good at this activity?“
Based on the answers to these questions, appropriate support can be sought (see Figure 3).

=== Intervention ===
Interventions based on the 3C-check can best be illustrated with an example. Let us assume a sales manager has performed a 3C-check with her sales representative with respect to a guided sales pitch.
[[File:3C-model Fig3.jpg|thumb|450x450px|right|Fig. 3. Practical application of the 3C-model: Intervention in case of motivation deficits.]]
If the 3C-check shows that the sales pitch in use is supported by the components head and heart, but not the component hand (this combination is represented by Section A in Fig. 3), it should first be discussed whether the lack of skill and ability is only subjective (i.e., felt by the sales representative) or also objective. In case of an objective skill and ability deficit, (e.g., when the co-worker is not yet familiar with the guidelines or the calculation methods used), measures like training, coaching, or collegial advice may be appropriate. Moreover, other colleagues may be asked to assist the sales representative and help overcome the hand-related obstacle. In case of a subjective skill and ability deficit, the manager could try to increase the sales representative’s self-efficacy by providing positive feedback about her employee’s prior performance.

The 3C-check might also reveal lacking support by the components head (represented by sector B in Fig. 3): The sales representative may not be convinced, that the guided sales pitch in use is instrumental, or she prefers other sales channels. Here, the supervisor is well advised to try to increase her employee’s cognitive support. For instance, she could convince her with arguments, set extrinsic rewards (e.g., a bonus) or solve goal conflicts by reprioritizing goals.

But what if the 3C-check shows that the components head and hand are fulfilled, but not the component heart (represented by sector C in Fig. 3)? That is if the sales representative finds the task important and instrumental and has all the required skills and abilities, but still does not like her task?

Perhaps she does not like following the rigid sales pitch guideline, she may not like to visit customers at home, or she may be anxious to receive a negative response from her customers. Here, her manager is well-advised to not ignore her lacking emotional support but to seek possible solutions. She could try to modify the task so that it better matches her employee’s underlying motives or to find motive-congruent incentives. Kehr and von Rosenstiel&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; call this “metamotivation”. For example, if her employee’s has a strong need for affiliation, she could try to preferably allocate uncomplicated, friendly customers to her, or to organize the sales pitch as a team event. In addition, the manager could assist her employee in finding a personal vision which matches her employees motives. These measures, if successful, arouse the component heart and increase one’s emotional support.&lt;ref&gt;Rawolle, M., Schultheiss, O. C., Strasser, A., &amp; Kehr, H. M. (2016). The Motivating Power of Visionary Images: Effects on Motivation, Affect, and Behavior. ''Journal of Personality''.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, the managers may consult her sales representative in finding effective volitional strategies to overcome her motivational barriers. Kehr und von Rosenstiel&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; call this “metavolition”. Here, it seems advisable to reduce overcontrol (e.g., negative fantasies, excessive impulse control, too much planning) and rather motivate oneself by reframing (positive fantasies) or by changing aversive framework conditions, for instance by conducting the sales pitch in a neutral environment.

If the 3C-check shows support from all three components (represented by the overlap section of the three circles in Fig. 3), the manager can delegate the task to her co-worker and trust her co-worker’s self-management. However, she might still want to keep in touch with her employee and be wary that the boundary conditions could become aversive or her co-workers motivation might change. Further, the manager should also consider future challenges for her co-worker.

== Scientific background ==

=== Development ===
Initially, the 3C-model was published as the “compensatory model of work motivation and volition”.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The original title referred to one of the central assumptions of the model, namely that volition compensates for insufficient motivation. Because of the potential confusion with “worker compensation,” however, the name was changed to “3C-model.”
The notion of three independent components of motivation is based on McClellands&lt;ref&gt;McClelland, D. C. (1985). How motives, skills, and values determine what people do. ''American psychologist, 40''(7), 812–825. doi:10.1037/0003-066X.40.7.812&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McClelland, D. C., Koestner, R., &amp; Weinberger, J. (1989). How do self-attributed and implicit motives differ? ''Psychological review, 96''(4), 690–702. doi:10.1037/0033-295X.96.4.690&lt;/ref&gt; differentiation of „motives, skills, and values“. The 3C-model relates this approach with other researchers‘ conceptions of volition,&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R. F., Muraven, M. &amp; Tice, D. M. (2000). Ego depletion: A resource model of volition, self-regulation, and controlled processing. ''Social Cognition, 18'', 130–150. doi:10.1521/soco.2000.18.2.130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhl, J. (2000). A functional-design approach to motivation and self-regulation: The dynamics of personality systems interactions. In M. Boekaerts, P.R. Pintrich &amp; M. Zeidner (Eds.), ''Handbook of Self-Regulation'' (pp. 111-169). San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; intrinsic motivation&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, R. M., &amp; Deci, E. L. (2000). Intrinsic and extrinsic motivations: Classic definitions and new directions. ''Contemporary educational psychology, 25''(1), 54-67.&lt;/ref&gt; and flow.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, M. (2000). ''Beyond boredom and anxiety: The experience of play in work and games''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth Kanfer, renowned expert for work motivation, calls the result from this integration a „radical, complementary new paradigm“ (''Applied Psychology'', 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;190).&lt;ref&gt;Kanfer, R. (2005). Self‐Regulation Research in Work and I/O Psychology. ''Applied Psychology, 54''(2), 186-191.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Empirical research ===
The 3C-model has attracted considerable empirical research conducted at the University of Munich, UC Berkeley, MGSM in Sydney and the Technische Universität München, amongst others. An overview of the research regarding the 3C-model is given by Kehr (2014).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Key results are:

Certain education styles are conducive for the development of discrepancies between head and heart, so-called motive discrepancies.&lt;ref&gt;Schattke, K., Koestner, R., &amp; Kehr, H. M. (2011). Childhood correlates of adult levels of incongruence between implicit and explicit motives. ''Motivation and Emotion, 35''(3), 306-316.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrepancies between head and heart impair well-being&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and lead to burnout.&lt;ref&gt;Rawolle, M., Wallis, M. S., Badham, R., &amp; Kehr, H. M. (2016). No fit, no fun: The effect of motive incongruence on job burnout and the mediating role of intrinsic motivation. ''Personality and Individual Differences, 89'', 65-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrepancies between head and heart reduce one’s willpower.&lt;ref&gt;Gröpel, P., &amp; Kehr, H. M. (2014). Motivation and self-control: Implicit motives moderate the exertion of self‐control in motive-related tasks. ''Journal of Personality, 82''(4), 317–328. doi:10.1111/jopy.12059&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Fear motives, e.g. fear of rejection, reduce one’s willpower and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Kehr, H. M. (2004c). ''Motivation und Volition: Funktionsanalysen, Feldstudien mit Führungskräften und Entwicklung eines Selbstmanagement-Trainings (SMT)''. Göttingen: Hogrefe.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flow results from all three components of the 3C-model being fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Schiepe-Tiska, A. (2013). ''In the power of flow: The impact of implicit and explicit motives on flow experience with a special focus on the power domain'' (Doctoral dissertation, Technische Universität München.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schattke, K., Brandstätter, V., Taylor, G., &amp; Kehr, H. M. (2015). Wahrgenommene Leistungsanreize moderieren den positiven Einfluss von Leistungsmotiv-Kongruenz auf das Flow-Erleben beim Hallenklettern.

The '''American Friends Service Committee''' ('''AFSC''') is a [[Religious Society of Friends]] (''[[Quaker]]'') founded organization working for [[peace]] and [[social justice]] in the United States and around the world. AFSC was founded in 1917 as a combined effort by American members of the Religious Society of Friends to assist [[civilian]] victims of [[World War I]].  It continued to engage in relief action in Europe and the Soviet Union after the Armistice of 1918.  By the mid-1920s it focused on improving racial relations in the U.S., as well as exploring ways to prevent the outbreak of another conflict before and after [[World War II]]. As the [[Cold War]] developed, it moved to employ more professionals rather than Quaker volunteers, and over time attempting to broaden its appeal and respond more forcefully to racial injustice, women's issues, and demands of sexual minorities for equal treatment.

==Background==
Quakers traditionally oppose [[violence]] in all of its forms and therefore many refuse to serve in the [[military]], including when [[Conscription|drafted]]. AFSC's original mission grew from the need to provide [[conscientious objector]]s (COs) with a constructive alternative to military service. In 1947 AFSC received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] along with its British counterpart, the Friends Service Council (now called [[Quaker Peace and Social Witness]]) on behalf of all Quakers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afsc.org/nobel-peace-prize|title=Nobel Peace Prize|date=2010-04-10|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although established by Friends, acting individually, AFSC and the Society of Friends have no legal connections, as stated by its long-time Executive Secretary Clarence Pickett in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = H. Larry Ingle | title = 'Truly Radical, Non-violent, Friendly Approaches':  Challenges to the American Friends Service Committee | journal = Quaker History | volume = 105 | issue = Spring | year = 2016 | pages = 1–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In April 1917—days after the United States joined [[World War I]] by declaring war on Germany and its allies—a group of Quakers met in [[Philadelphia]] to discuss the pending [[military draft]] and how it would affect members of [[peace churches]] such as Quakers, [[Mennonites]], [[Church of the Brethren|Brethren]], and the [[Amish]]. They developed ideas for [[alternative service]] that could be done directly in the battle zones of northern France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://afsc.org/story/origin-american-friends-service-committee|title=Origin of the American Friends Service Committee|date=2010-03-29|access-date=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:American Friends Service Committee logo.png|frame|left|A historic AFSC logo]]
They also developed plans for dealing with the [[United States Army]], since it had been inconsistent in its dealing with religious objectors to previous wars. Although legally members of [[pacifism|pacifist]] [[Religious denomination|churches]] were exempt from the draft, individual state draft boards interpreted the law in a variety of ways. Many Quakers and other COs were ordered to report to army camps for military service. Some COs, unaware of the significance of reporting for duty, found that this was interpreted by the military as willingness to fight. One of AFSC's first tasks was to identify CO's, find the camps where they were located, and then visit them to provide spiritual guidance and moral support. In areas where the pacifist churches were more well known (such as [[Pennsylvania]]), a number of draft boards were willing to assign COs to AFSC for alternative service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afsc.org/story/origin-afsc Origin of AFSC] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209200705/http://afsc.org/story/origin-afsc |date=2010-12-09 }} by former AFSC Archivist Jack Sutters&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to conducting alternative service programs for COs, AFSC collected relief in the form of food, clothing, and other supplies for [[displaced person]]s in France. Quakers were asked to collect old and make new clothing; to grow fruits and vegetables, can them, and send them to AFSC headquarters in Philadelphia. AFSC then shipped the materials to France for distribution. The young men and women sent to work in France, working with British Quakers, provided relief and medical care to refugees, repaired and rebuilt homes, helped farmers replant fields damaged by the war, and founded a [[maternity hospital]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1947/friends-committee-history.html|title=American Friends Service Committee – History|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the war in 1918, AFSCs began working in Russia, Serbia, and Poland with orphans and with the victims of famine and disease, and in Germany and Austria, where they set up kitchens to feed hungry children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Eventually AFSC was chartered by President [[Herbert Hoover]] to provide the United States sponsored relief to Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1947/press.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1947 – Presentation Speech|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s and through [[World War II]], AFSC helped refugees escape from [[Nazi Germany]], aiding people who were not being helped by other organizations, primarily non-religious Jews and Jews married to non-Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|title=Quakers|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005212#|website=Holocaust Encyclopedia|publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also provided relief for children on both sides of the [[Spanish Civil War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maul|first=Daniel|date=2016-01-02|title=The politics of neutrality: the American Friends Service Committee and the Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13507486.2015.1121972|journal=European Review of History: Revue européenne d'histoire|volume=23|issue=1–2|pages=82–100|doi=10.1080/13507486.2015.1121972|issn=1350-7486}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided relief to refugees in [[Vichy France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dspace.udel.edu:8080/dspace/bitstream/handle/19716/5727/Hillary_Mohaupt_thesis.pdf ''All in the Same Boat: Non-French Women and Resistance in France, 1940–1944''], Hillary Mohaupt, Spring 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time AFSC operated several [[Civilian Public Service]] camps for a new generation of COs. When [[Japanese American]]s were "[[Internment of Japanese Americans|evacuated]]" from the West Coast into inland concentration camps, the AFSC headed the effort to help college students transfer to Midwest and East Coast schools in order to avoid camp, and worked with Japanese Americans resettling in several cities during and after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, Allan W. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/American%20Friends%20Service%20Committee/ "American Friends Service Committee"] ''Densho Encyclopedia''. Accessed July 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war ended, they did relief and reconstruction work in Europe, Japan, India, and China. In 1947 they worked to resettle refugees during the [[partition of India]], and in the [[Gaza Strip]].  Between 1937 and 1943, the AFSC built the [[Penn-Craft Historic District|Penn-Craft community]] for unemployed coal miners in [[Fayette County, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp |title=National Historic Landmarks &amp; National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania |publisher=CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System |format=Searchable database }} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web|url=https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H092343_01H.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Penn-Craft Historic District |accessdate=2012-01-29 |author=Louis Orslene and Susan Shearer |format=PDF |date=February 1989 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714155201/https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H092343_01H.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Cold War]] escalated, AFSC was involved in relief and service efforts, often supporting civilians on both sides of conflicts around the world including the [[Korean War]], the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], the [[Algerian War]], and the [[Nigerian-Biafran War]]. Beginning in 1966, AFSC developed programs to help children and provided medical supplies and [[artificial limb]]s to civilians in both [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]]. Unable to secure U.S. State Department approval to send medical supplies to North Vietnam, the committee dispatched goods through Canada. AFSC also supported draft counseling for young American men throughout the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/01/frances_crowe_to_read_from_her.html|title=Frances Crowe to read from her memoir at First Churches in Northampton on Sunday|access-date=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, the committee published ''Speak Truth to Power:  A Quaker Search for an Alternative to Violence'', drafted by a group including Stephen G. Cary, [[A. J. Muste]], [[Robert Pickus]], and [[Bayard Rustin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/PDFs/Peaceconference/Chmielewski.DOC Wendy Chmielewski, “Speak Truth to Power:  Religion, Race, and Sexuality, and Politics During the Cold War”]&lt;/ref&gt; Focused on the Cold War, the 71-page pamphlet asserted that it sought "to give practical demonstration to the effectiveness of love in human relations".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.afsc.org/sites/afsc.civicactions.net/files/documents/Speak_Truth_to_Power.pdf Speak truth to power: a Quaker search for an alternative for violence] from AFSC's archives&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely commented on in the press, both secular and religious, and proved to be a major statement of [[Christian pacifism]].

In the United States, AFSC supported the [[American Civil Rights Movement]], and the rights of [[African-American]]s, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[Mexican American]]s, and [[Asian American]]s. Since the 1970s AFSC has also worked extensively as part of the [[peace movement]], especially work to stop the production and deployment of [[nuclear weapon]]s.

== Budget ==
In fiscal year 2015, AFSC had revenues of US$28.6&amp;nbsp;million and expenses of US$36.1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afsc.org/sites/afsc.civicactions.net/files/documents/2015%20Audited%20Financial%20Statements_0.pdf|title=Financial Statements and Report|last=|first=|date=2016-02-02|website=|publisher=Tait Weller|access-date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; AFSC had net assets of US$87.8&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afsc.org/sites/afsc.civicactions.net/files/documents/AR15_FINAL.pdf|title=Annual Report 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=American Friends Service Committee|access-date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs and projects== &lt;!-- Anchor for redirect: [Cost of War]. --&gt;
Today AFSC programs address a wide range of issues, countries, and communities. AFSC describes the programs as united by "the unfaltering belief in the essential worth of every human being, non-violence as the way to resolve conflict, and the power of love to overcome oppression, discrimination, and violence".&lt;ref&gt;[http://afsc.org/our-work AFSC's Our Work page]; afsc.org&lt;/ref&gt;

AFSC employs more than two hundred staff working in dozens of programs throughout the United States and works in thirteen other nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afsc.org/where-we-work AFSC's Where We Work page]; afsc.org&lt;/ref&gt; AFSC has divided the organization's programs between 14 geographic regions, each of which runs programs related to peace, [[immigrant rights]], [[restorative justice]], economic justice, and other causes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afsc.org/afsc-structure AFSC's structure page]; Afsc.org&lt;/ref&gt; AFSC's international programs often work in conjunction with [[Quaker Peace and Social Witness]] (formerly the British Friends Service Council) and other partners.

AFSC also provides administrative support to the [[Quaker United Nations Office]] (QUNO) in [[New York City]].  This office is the official voice of Quakerism in the [[United Nations]] headquarters.  There is a second QUNO office in [[Geneva, Switzerland]]; support for that office is provided by European Quakers.  QUNO is overseen by the [[Friends World Committee for Consultation]].

AFSC carries out many programs around the world.  The organization's 2010 annual report&lt;ref&gt;[http://afsc.org/document/building-peace-one-community-time-annual-report-2010 Building Peace One Community at a Time: Annual Report 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; describes work in several African countries, Haiti, Indonesia, and the United States. Recently AFSC opened a traveling art exhibit called ''Windows &amp; Mirrors'', examining the impact on [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|the war in Afghanistan]] on civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://windowsandmirrors.org/about The official Windows and Mirrors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209073233/http://www.windowsandmirrors.org/about |date=2011-12-09 }} information page.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost of War project===
''Cost of War'' are real-time cost-estimation exhibits, each featuring a counter/estimator for the [[Iraq War]] and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan War]].  These exhibits are maintained by the [[National Priorities Project]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalpriorities.org Official Site]; [[National Priorities Project]]&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 1, 2010 both wars had a combined estimated cost of over 1&amp;nbsp;trillion dollars, separately the Iraq War had an estimated cost of 725&amp;nbsp;billion dollars and the Afghanistan War had an estimated cost of 276&amp;nbsp;billion dollars.  The numbers are based on [[US Congress]] appropriation reports and do not include "future medical care for soldiers and veterans wounded in the war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://costofwar.com/numbers.html |title=The Cost of War – How we got the numbers |accessdate=2007-02-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030601111846/http://costofwar.com/numbers.html |archivedate=2003-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exhibits====
Based on National Priorities Project Cost of War concept, American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) launched an exhibit title titled "Cost of War" in May 2007, at the close of the National [[Eyes Wide Open (exhibit)|Eyes Wide Open]] Exhibit.  It features ten budget trade-offs displayed on 3x7 foot full-color vinyl banners.  AFSC uses to cost of the Iraq War estimated by economists Linda Bilmes and [[Joseph Stiglitz]] in the article "Economic Costs of the Iraq War: An Appraisal Three Years After The Beginning Of The Conflict", written in January 2006 that estimates the total daily cost of the Iraq War at $720 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Bilmes| first1 = Linda| last2 = Stiglitz| first2 = Joseph E.| title = The Economic Costs of the Iraq War: An Appraisal Three Years after the Beginning of the Conflict| doi = 10.2139/ssrn.832646| journal = |date=January 2006| id = KSG Working Paper No. 06-002}}&lt;/ref&gt; AFSC uses The [[National Priorities Project]]'s per unit costs for human needs such as health care and education to make budget comparisons between the U.S. budget for human needs to "One Day of the Iraq War".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://costofwar.com/en/ |title=Cost of War to the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ten banners read:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afsc.org/cost/banners.htm |title=Cost of War – How would you spend it? |accessdate=2013-04-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814232238/http://www.afsc.org/cost/banners.htm |archivedate=2007-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eyes Wide Open project ===
In 2004, AFSC started the project ''Eyes Wide Open'' in [[Chicago]]. ''Eyes Wide Open'' is an exhibition on the human cost of the wars in [[Iraq War (2003–11)|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afsc.org/campaign/eyes-wide-open|title=Eyes Wide Open|date=2010-03-19|access-date=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current key issues ===

==Criticism==
Throughout much of the group's history the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|US Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and other government agencies have monitored the work of this and many other similar organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/monitoring-america/1/ |title=Washington Post article, Monitoring America |access-date=2011-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402215328/http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/monitoring-america/1/ |archive-date=2011-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FOIA&gt;Documents released under the freedom of information act are hosted on the [http://vault.fbi.gov/American%20Friends%20Service%20Committee FBI's website] {{Webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20141205035644/http://vault.fbi.gov/American%20Friends%20Service%20Committee%20 |date=2014-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spying&gt;In recent years AFSC has worked with the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] on several efforts to end spying by [https://www.aclu.org/privacy/spying/15186prs20021121.html local police], the [http://www.progressive.org/mag_mcafsc FBI], the [http://www.afsc.org/news/2005/government-spying.htm Pentagon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426044040/http://www.afsc.org/news/2005/government-spying.htm |date=2006-04-26 }} and the [http://new.aclu-wa.org/detail.cfm?id=419 NSA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907123917/http://new.aclu-wa.org/detail.cfm?id=419 |date=2006-09-07 }} targeted at AFSC and other organizations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, criticism has also come from liberals within the Society of Friends, who charge that AFSC has drifted from its Quaker roots and has become indistinguishable from other [[pressure group|political pressure groups]]. Quakers expressed concern with AFSC's abolition of their youth work camps during the 1960s and what some saw as a decline of Quaker participation in the organization.

In June 1979, a cover article in [[The New Republic]] attacked AFSC for abandoning the tradition of [[pacifism]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afriendlyletter.com/afsc-quakers-i-the-background-of-a-concern/|title=AFSC &amp; Quakers I: The Background of a Concern – A Friendly Letter|date=2010-06-19|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticisms became prominent after a gathering of [[Friends General Conference]] in Richmond, Indiana, in the summer of 1979 when many Friends joined with prominent leaders, such as [[Kenneth Boulding]], to call for a firmer Quaker orientation toward public issues.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Chuck Fager, ed., Quaker Service at the Crossroads:  American Friends, The American Friends Service Committee, and Peace and Revolution, Kimo Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to the FGC Gathering, a letter listing the points of criticism was signed by 130 Friends and sent to the AFSC Board. In 1988, the book ''Peace and Revolution''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/peace-revolution-the-moral-crisis-of-american-pacifism/oclc/17439651&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Peace &amp; revolution: the moral crisis of American pacifism|last=Lewy|first=Guenter|date=1988-01-01|publisher=W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co.|isbn=0802836402|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; by conservative scholar [[Guenter Lewy]] repeated charges that AFSC had abandoned pacifism and religion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In response to Lewy's book, [[Chuck Fager]] published ''Quaker Service at the Crossroads''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afriendlyletter.com/files/Quaker%20Service%20At%20The%20Crossroads%20--%201988.pdf|title=Quaker Service at the Crossroads|last=Fager|first=Chuck|date=1988|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Fager described that AFSC was "divorced" from Quakers' life as faith community due to "an increasingly pronounced drift toward a lefty [[secularism]]" since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was reported that the Committee in 1975 adopted "a formal decision to make the Middle East its major issue".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.romirowsky.com/18076/quakers-israel|title=The Quakers, No Friends of Israel|last=Romirowsky|first=Alexander Joffe and Asaf|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-quakers-no-friends-of-israel-1446768728|title=The Quakers, No Friends of Israel|last=Romirowsky|first=Alexander Joffe And Asaf|date=2015-11-06|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Jewish supporters of Israeli government policies have accused AFSC of having an [[anti-Jewish]] bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=H. David |last=Kirk |title=The Friendly Perversion: Quakers as Reconciliers: Good People and Dirty Work |publisher=Americans for a Safe Israel |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, [[Jacob Neusner]] called the Committee "the most militant and aggressive of Christian anti-Israel groups".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In the aftermath of the Holocaust |first=Jacob |last=Neusner |publisher=Garland |year=1993 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFSC's position on its web site is that it "supports the use of boycott and divestment campaigns targeting only companies that support the occupation, settlements, militarism, or any other violations of international humanitarian or human rights law. Our position does not call for a full boycott of Israel nor of companies because they are either Israeli or doing business in Israel. Our actions also never focus on individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/u-s-quaker-group-that-won-nobel-on-israels-bds-blacklist-1.5729790 |title=How a U.S. Quaker Group That Won the Nobel Peace Prize Ended Up on Israel's BDS Blacklist |author=Allison Kaplan Sommer |work=Haaretz |date=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Library Association''' ('''ALA''') is a [[nonprofit organization]] based in the [[United States]] that promotes [[library|libraries]] and library education internationally. It is the oldest and largest library association in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=American Library Association - MSN Encarta &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt; |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/RefArticle.aspx?refid=761563357 |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKCy7XB?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/RefArticle.aspx?refid=761563357 |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with more than 57,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;"Report to Executive Board," by ALA Interim Executive Director Mary Ghikas, EBD  #7.0, 2017- 2018, December 28, 2017,  "The total ALA membership roster at the end of October 2017 was 57,498 compared to the October 2017 count of 57,195.

==History==
Founded by [[Justin Winsor]], [[Charles Ammi Cutter]], [[Samuel Swett Green|Samuel S. Green]], James L. Whitney, [[Melvil Dewey]] (Melvil Dui), Fred B. Perkins, [[Charles Evans (librarian)|Charles Evans]], and [[Thomas W. Bicknell]] on October 6, 1876 during the Centennial Exposition in [[Philadelphia]] and chartered&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.ala.org/aboutala/history/charter-1879-revised-1942 ALA Charter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328000718/http://www.ala.org/aboutala/history/charter-1879-revised-1942 |date=2014-03-28 }})&lt;/ref&gt; in 1879 in [[Massachusetts]], its head office is now in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Justin-Winsor|title=Justin Winsor {{!}} American librarian|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Centennial Exposition]] in Philadelphia in 1876, 103 librarians, 90 men and 13 women, responded to a call for a "Convention of Librarians" to be held October 4–6 at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. At the end of the meeting, according to Ed Holley in his essay "ALA at 100," "the register was passed around for all to sign who wished to become charter members," making October 6, 1876, to be ALA's birthday.
In attendance were 90 men and 13 women, among them Justin Winsor (Boston Public, Harvard), William Frederick Poole (Chicago Public, Newberry), Charles Ammi Cutter (Boston Athenaeum), Melvil Dewey, and Richard Rogers Bowker. Attendees came from as far west as Chicago and from England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=History | url=http://www.ala.org/aboutala/history}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The aim of the association, in that resolution, was "to enable librarians to do their present work more easily and at less expense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/aboutala/missionhistory/history |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128031727/http://www.ala.org/aboutala/missionhistory/history |archivedate=2013-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The association has worked throughout its history to define, extend, protect and advocate for equity of access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=ED462981|title=''Rocks in the Whirlpool: Equity of Access and the American Library Association''}}|  Submitted to the Executive Board of the American Library Association June 14, 2002.| ERIC (Education Resources Information Center)|  ED462981| Retrieved December 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Library activists in the 1930s pressured the American Library Association to be more responsive to issues put forth by young members involved with issues such as peace, segregation, library unions and intellectual freedom.  In 1931, the Junior Members Round Table (JMRT) was formed to provide a voice for the younger members of the ALA, but much of what they had to say resurfaced in the social responsibility movement to come years later.&lt;ref&gt;(Samek, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;7)&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period, the first [[Library Bill of Rights]] (LBR) was drafted by [[Forrest Spaulding]] to set a standard against censorship and was adopted by the ALA in 1939.  This has been recognized as the moment defining modern librarianship as a profession committed to intellectual freedom and the right to read over government dictates.&lt;ref&gt;(Robbins, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;166)&lt;/ref&gt;  The ALA formed the Staff Organization's Round Table in 1936 and the Library Unions Round Table in 1940.

The ALA appointed a committee to study censorship and recommend policy after the banning of ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' and the implementation of the LBR.  The committee reported in 1940 that intellectual freedom and professionalism were linked and recommended a permanent committee – Committee on Intellectual Freedom.&lt;ref name="McCook, 2011, p. 63"&gt;(McCook, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;63)&lt;/ref&gt;  The ALA made revisions to strengthen the LBR in June 1948, approved the Statement on Labeling in 1951 to discourage labeling material as subversive, and adopted the Freedom to Read Statement and the Overseas Library Statement in 1953.&lt;ref name="McCook, 2011, p. 63"/&gt;

In 1961, the ALA took a stand regarding service to [[African Americans]] and others, advocating for equal library service for all.  An amendment was passed to the LBR in 1961 that made clear that an individual's library use should not be denied or abridged because of race, religion, national origin, or political views.  Some communities decided to close their doors rather than desegregate.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, R. E. (2010). Foundations of library and information science (3rd edn). New York: Neal-Schuman, p.294&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1963, the ALA commissioned a study, ''Access to Public Libraries'', which found direct and indirect discrimination in American libraries.&lt;ref&gt;(McCook, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;55)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, some librarians protested against a pro-[[Vietnam War]] speech given by General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]] at the annual ALA conference in San Francisco; the former president of [[Sarah Lawrence College]], Harold Taylor, spoke to the Middle-Atlantic Regional Library Conference about socially responsible professionalism; and less than one year later a group of librarians proposed that the ALA schedule a new round table program discussion on the social responsibilities of librarians at its next annual conference in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].  This group called themselves the Organizing Committee for the ALA Round Table on Social Responsibilities of Libraries.  This group drew in many other under-represented groups in the ALA who lacked power, including the Congress for Change in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;(Samek, 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;67–8)&lt;/ref&gt;  This formation of the committee was approved in 1969 and would change its name to the '''Social Responsibilities Round Table''' (SRRT) in 1971).  After its inception, the Round Table of Social Responsibilities began to press ALA leadership to address issues such as library unions, working conditions, wages, and intellectual freedom.  The [[Freedom to Read Foundation]] was created by ALA's Executive Board in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;(Samek, 2001, p. 69)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Black Caucus of the American Library Association|Black Caucus of the ALA]] and the Office for Literacy and Outreach were set up in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;(Rubin, 2004, p. 296)&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1990, the ALA approved "Policy on Library Services to the Poor" and in 1996 the Task Force on Hunger Homelessness, and Poverty was formed to resurrect and promote the ALA guidelines on library services to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;(Berman, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;12)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Courtney Young, the president of the association, commented on the background and implications of a racist joke author [[Daniel Handler]] made as African-American writer [[Jacqueline Woodson]] received a National Book Award for ''Brown Girl Dreaming''. "His comments were inappropriate and fell far short of the association's commitment to diversity," said Young. "Handler's remarks come at a time when the publishing world has little diversity. Works from authors and illustrators of color make up less than 8 percent of children's titles produced in 2013. The ALA hopes this regrettable incident will be used to open a dialogue on the need for diversity in the publishing industry, particularly in regards to books for young people."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/books/2014/11/29/award-winning-author-jacqueline-woodson-responds-racist-joke "Award-Winning Author Jacqueline Woodson Responds to Racist Joke"], ''The Advocate'', November 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
ALA membership is open to any person or organization, though most of its members are [[library|libraries]] or librarians. Most members live and work in the United States, with international members comprising 3.5% of total membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/aboutala/missionhistory/plan/international | title =ALA International Member Survey | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2006-11-14 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20121015051420/http://www.ala.org/aboutala/missionhistory/plan/international | archivedate =2012-10-15 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Notable sub-organizations====

Established in 1969, the Social Responsibilities Round Table currently oversees a number of task forces including the 'Feminist Task Force'; the 'Hunger, Homelessness, and Poverty Task Force (HHPTF)'; the 'International Responsibilities Task Force'; the 'Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Task Force (MLKTF)'; 'The Rainbow Project Task Force'; and the 'Task Force on the Environment'. According to their website, the Social Responsibilities Round Table (SRRT) have worked to make the American Library Association (ALA) more democratic and progressive. Their primary focus is to promote social responsibility as a core value in librarianship and to ensure that libraries and librarians work to recognize and solve social problems in their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/rt/srrt/about-srrt|website=www.ala.org|publisher=The Social Responsibilities Round Table of the American Library Association|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the ALA founded the first [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] professional organization, called the "Task Force on Gay Liberation", now known as the [[Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table]] or GLBT Round Table.&lt;ref name=glbtrt&gt;{{cite web | title=Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgendered Round Table (GLBTRT) |url=http://www.ala.org/glbtrt/ | publisher=ALA | accessdate=2010-09-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100916223855/http://ala.org/ala/mgrps/rts/glbtrt/index.cfm| archivedate= 16 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gittings&gt;{{cite book |last=Gittings |first=Barbara |title=Gays in Library Land: The Gay and Lesbian Task Force of the American Library Association: The First Sixteen Years |location=Philadelphia |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first leader was [[Israel David Fishman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel David Fishman papers|url=http://archives.nypl.org/mss/1012|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Gittings]] became its coordinator in 1971. In the early 1970s, the Task Force on Gay Liberation campaigned to have books about the gay liberation movement at the [[Library of Congress]] reclassified from HQ 71–471 ("Abnormal Sexual Relations, Including Sexual Crimes"). In 1972, after receiving a letter requesting the reclassification, the Library of Congress agreed to make the shift, reclassifying those books into a newly created category, HQ 76.5 ("Homosexuality, Lesbianism—Gay Liberation Movement, Homophile Movement"). In 1971, the GLBTRT created the first award for GLBT books, the Stonewall Book Award, which celebrates books of exceptional merit that relate to LGBT issues. ''[[Patience and Sarah]]'' by [[Alma Routsong]] (pen name Isabel Miller) was the first winner. In 1992, American Libraries published a photo of the GLBTRT (then called the Gay and Lesbian Task Force) on the cover of its July/August issue, drawing both criticism and praise from the library world. Some commenters called the cover "in poor taste" and accused American Libraries of "glorifying homosexuality," while others were supportive of the move. Christine Williams, who wrote an essay about the controversy surrounding the cover, concluded that in the mid-90s, the library world was "not an especially welcoming place to gays and lesbians." In 2010, the GLBTRT announced a new committee, the Over the Rainbow Committee. This committee annually compiles a bibliography of books that show the GLBT community in a favorable light and reflects the interests of adults. The bibliographies provide guidance to libraries in the selection of positive GLBT materials.

On July 23, 1976, the [[Committee on the Status of Women in Librarianship]] was established as a Council Committee of the ALA on recommendation of the Ad Hoc Committee with the same name (which had been appointed by the President of the ALA in December 1975) and of the Committee on Organization. The Committee on the Status of Women in Librarianship works to "officially represent the diversity of women's interest within ALA and to ensure that the Association considers the rights of the majority (women) in the library field; to promote and initiate the collection, analysis, dissemination, and coordination of information on the status of women in librarianship; to coordinate the activities of ALA units which consider questions of special relevance for women; to identify lags, gaps, and possible discrimination in resources and programs relating to women; in cooperation with other ALA units, to help develop and evaluate tools, guidelines, and programs designed to enhance the opportunities and the image of women in the library profession, thus raising the level of consciousness concerning women; to establish contacts with committees on women within other professional groups and to officially represent ALA concerns at interdisciplinary meetings on women's equality; and to provide Council and Membership with reports needed for establishment of policies and actions related to the status of women in librarianship; and to monitor ALA units to ensure consideration of the rights of women." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/offices/hrdr/abouthrdr/hrdrliaisoncomm/statusofwomen/committeestatus|title=COSWL|work=ala.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="library.illinois.edu"&gt;http://www.library.illinois.edu/archives/ala/holdings/?p=creators/creator&amp;id=3540{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the Committee on the Status of Women in Librarianship received the Bailey K. Howard - World Book Encyclopedia - ALA Goal Award to develop a profile of ALA personal members, known as the COSWL Study. In 1980, the Committee on the Status of Women in Librarianship was awarded the J. Morris Jones - World Book Encyclopedia - ALA Goals Award with the OLPR Advisory Committee to undertake a special project on equal pay for work of equal value.&lt;ref name="library.illinois.edu"/&gt;

Beside the Alex Awards, ALA disseminates some annual lists of [[ALA Notable Books|"Notable"]] and "Best" books and other media.

The annual awards roster includes the [[John Cotton Dana Award]] for excellence in library public relations.

In 2000, the Office for Literacy and Outreach Services (OLOS) launched the [[Jean E. Coleman Library Outreach Lecture]] in tribute to the work of the first OLOS director, Dr. Jean E. Coleman.  [[Barbara J. Ford]] gave the inaugural lecture, "Libraries, Literacy, Outreach and the Digital Divide."

Since 2006, the ALA has selected a class of [[Emerging Leaders]], typically comprising about 100 librarians and library school students. This minor distinction is a form of organizational outreach to new librarians. The Emerging Leaders are allocated to project groups tasked with developing solutions to specified problems within ALA divisions. The class meets at the ALA Midwinter and Annual Meetings, commonly January and June. Project teams may present posters of their completed projects at the Annual.&lt;ref&gt;Emerging Leaders Program Info: http://www.ala.org/educationcareers/leadership/emergingleaders&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conferences====
The ALA and its divisions hold numerous conferences throughout the year. The two largest conferences are the annual conference and the midwinter meeting. The latter is typically held in January and focused on internal business, while the annual conference is typically held in June and focused on exhibits and presentations. The ALA annual conference is notable for being one of the largest professional conferences in existence, typically drawing over 25,000 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=confservices | title =Conference Services | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2006-11-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061116140233/http://www.ala.org/template.cfm?Section=confservices| archivedate= 16 November 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Librarianship and human rights in the United States}}
The ALA [[Public Library Advocacy|advocates]] positions on [[United States]] political issues that it believes are related to libraries and librarianship. For court cases that touch on issues about which the organization holds positions, the ALA often files [[amicus curiae|amici curiae]] briefs, voluntarily offering information on some aspect of the case to assist the court in deciding a matter before it. The ALA has an office in [[Washington, D.C.]], that [[Lobbying|lobbies]] [[United States Congress|Congress]] on issues relating to libraries, information and communication. It also provides materials to libraries that may include information on how to apply for grants, how to comply with the law, and how to oppose a law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/wo/index.cfm | title =Washington Office | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2010-09-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100920060616/http://ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/wo/index.cfm| archivedate= 20 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual freedom===
{{See also|Book censorship in the United States}}
The primary documented expressions of the ALA's intellectual freedom principles are the Freedom to Read Statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/freedomreadstatement| title= Freedom to Read Statement| publisher= ALA| accessdate= 2018-04-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100826004143/http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/oif/statementspols/ftrstatement/freedomreadstatement.cfm| archivedate= 2010-08-26| deadurl= no| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Library Bill of Rights]]; the Library Bill of Rights urges libraries to "challenge censorship in the fulfillment of their responsibility to provide information and enlightenment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill | title =Library Bill of Rights | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2010-09-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100920062636/http://ala.org/ala/issuesadvocacy/intfreedom/librarybill/index.cfm| archivedate= 20 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ALA Code of Ethics]] also calls on librarians to "uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and resist all efforts to censor library resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/proethics/codeofethics/codeethics | title=Article II, ALA Code of Professional Ethics | publisher=ALA | accessdate =2010-09-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100920133140/http://ala.org/ala/issuesadvocacy/proethics/codeofethics/codeethics.cfm| archivedate= 20 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ALA maintains an Office for Intellectual Freedom (OIF), which is charged with "implementing ALA policies concerning the concept of [[intellectual freedom]],"&lt;ref name="Office for Intellectual Freedom"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/offices/oif | title =Office for Intellectual Freedom | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2010-09-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100920055430/http://ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/oif/index.cfm| archivedate= 20 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined as "the right of every individual to both seek and receive information from all points of view without restriction.

Since January 2016 the OIF has been headed by James Larue.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell-Stone, Deborah (December&amp;nbsp;9, 2015). "[http://www.oif.ala.org/oif/?p=5817 James LaRue to head ALA’s Office for Intellectual Freedom and the Freedom to Read Foundation]". ''Intellectual Freedom Blog''. The Office for Intellectual Freedom of the American Library Association. oif.ala.org. Retrieved 2018-01-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Larue is the third director of the office, having succeeded Barbara M. Jones, former University Librarian for Wesleyan University and internationally known intellectual freedom advocate and author. Jones had assumed the position in December 2009; prior to that, the first director, [[Judith Krug]], had headed the office for four decades, until her death in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 2009-12-02 | url = http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6709656.html | title = Barbara Jones, Ex-Director at Wesleyan, Named Head of ALA OIF and FTRF | work = Library Journal | publisher = MediaSource, Inc. | accessdate = 2010-09-01 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120614061145/http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6709656.html | archivedate = 2012-06-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, the Intellectual Freedom Committee, the forerunner of the OIF, investigated the termination of [[Ruth W. Brown]] as librarian of the [[Bartlesville]] Public Library, a position she held in the [[Oklahoma]] town for 30 years.  Brown's termination was based on the false allegation that she was a communist and that she had as part of the library's serials collection two left wing publications, ''[[The New Republic]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]''.  The ALA support for her and the subsequent legal case was the first such investigation undertaken by the ALA or one of its state chapters.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, L.S. (2000). The dismissal of Miss Ruth Brown. Norman, The University of Oklahoma Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, radio personality [[Laura Schlessinger]] campaigned publicly against the ALA's intellectual freedom policy, specifically in regard to the ALA's refusal to remove a link on its web site to a specific sex-education site for teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date =1999-05-10 | url =http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA158676.html | title ="Dr. Laura" Continues Criticism of ALA | work =Library Journal | publisher =MediaSource, Inc. | accessdate =2006-11-14 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204559/http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA158676.html | archivedate =2007-09-30 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sharon Priestly]] said, however, that Schlessinger "distorted and misrepresented the ALA stand to make it sound like the ALA was saying porno for 'children' is O.K."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Priestly | first =Sharon |date=Winter 2001 |  title =Don't Listen to Dr. Laura | journal =Free Inquiry | publisher = | volume = 41 | issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the ALA filed suit with library users and the ACLU against the United States [[Children's Internet Protection Act]] (CIPA), which required libraries receiving federal E-rate discounts for Internet access to install a "technology protection measure" to prevent children from accessing "visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.ifea.net/cipa.pdf | title =Text of the Children's Internet Protection Act}}&lt;/ref&gt; At trial, the federal district court struck down the law as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Am. Lib. Asso.'', 201 F.Supp.2d 401, 490 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The government appealed this decision, and on June 23, 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] upheld the law as constitutional as a condition imposed on institutions in exchange for government funding. In upholding the law, the Supreme Court, adopting the interpretation urged by the U.S. Solicitor General at oral argument, made it clear that the constitutionality of CIPA would be upheld only "if, as the Government represents, a librarian will unblock filtered material or disable the Internet software filter without significant delay on an adult user's request."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = | url =http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=539&amp;invol=194 | title =''US v ALA'' 539 U.S. 194, 2003 | format = | work = | publisher =FindLaw | accessdate =2007-03-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070219172248/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=539&amp;invol=194| archivedate= 19 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy===

==== 1970s ====
The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] attempted to use librarians as possible informants in the conspiracy case of the [[Harrisburg Seven]] in 1971. The Harrisburg Seven, made up of religious anti-war activists, were primarily accused of conspiring to kidnap National Security Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]]. The supposed leader of the group, [[Philip Berrigan]], was serving time at the Lewisburg penitentiary. The FBI sought "to use library surveillance and librarian informants" at [[Bucknell University]] as evidence of the Harrisburg Seven's "characters and intentions."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamdan|first=Sarah Shik|year=2013|title=Why library cards offer more privacy rights than proof of citizenship: Librarian ethics and Freedom of Information Act requestor policies|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X13000075?|journal=Government Information Quarterly|volume=30|pages=133|via=Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.giq.2012.12.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd Douglas became one such informant for the FBI: he was a prisoner at the same penitentiary with a work-release position at the library. Boyd presented himself as an anti-war activist and offered to smuggle letters he collected while at work to Philip Berrigan at the prison.

The FBI also attempted to use [[Zoia Horn]], a librarian at the Bucknell library, and interviewed other library workers. The FBI met with Horn in her home to debrief her, but Horn refused to answer their questions. She refused to testify, even after she was given immunity from self-incrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sparanese|first=Ann|year=2003|title=Activist Librarianship: Heritage or Heresy?|url=|journal=Progressive Librarian|volume=22|pages=45|via=Biography Reference Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horn stated, "To me it stands on: Freedom of thought" and that the government "spying in homes, in libraries and universities inhibits and destroys this freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IalBZuoiOf4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20CIA%20on%20Campus%3A%20Essays%20on%20Academic%20Freedom%20and%20the%20National%20Security%20State&amp;pg=PP1&amp;q=The%20CIA%20on%20Campus:%20Essays%20on%20Academic%20Freedom%20and%20the%20National%20Security%20State|title=The CIA on Campus: Essays on Academic Freedom and the National Security State|last=Zwerling|first=Philip|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=105|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoia Horn was charged with contempt of the court and served 20 days in jail. She was "the first librarian who spent time in jail for a value of our profession" according to [[Judith Krug]] of the American Library Association's Office for Intellectual Freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/Zoia-Horn-1st-U-S-librarian-jailed-over-alleged-5624023.php|title=Zoia Horn, librarian jailed for not testifying against protesters|last=Egelko|first=Bob|date=2014-07-15|website=San Francisco Chronicle|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horn continued to fight for intellectual freedom in libraries and beyond. The Intellectual Freedom Committee of the California Library Association now awards the Zoia Horn Intellectual Freedom Award in honor of those who make contributions to intellectual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cla-net.org/?118|title=Zoia Horn Intellectual Freedom Award|last=|first=|date=|website=California Library Association|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, [[United States Department of the Treasury]] agents also pressured public libraries across the country to "release circulation records recording the names and identifying information of people who checked out books on bomb making."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ALA believed this to be an "unconscionable and unconstitutional invasion of library patrons' privacy."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As a result of these two situations and many others, the ALA affirmed the confidential status of all records which held patron names in a ''Policy on the Confidentiality of Library Records''. The ALA also released the ALA Statement on Professional Ethics in 1975 which advocated for the protection of the "confidential relationship" between a library user and a library.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== 1980s ====
The FBI tried to use surveillance in library settings as part of its [[Library Awareness Program]] of the 1980s; it aimed to use librarians "as partners in surveillance." The program was known to the FBI as "The Development of Counterintelligence Among Librarians," indicating that the FBI believed that librarians might be supportive in its counterintelligence investigations. The FBI attempted to profile "Russian or Slavic-sounding last names" of library patrons to look for possible "national security threats." The FBI wanted libraries to help it trace "the reading habits of patrons with those names."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The ALA responded by writing to the FBI director. The Intellectual Freedom Committee also created "an advisory statement to warn libraries" of the Library Awareness Program, including ways to help librarians "avoid breaking their ethical obligations if faced with FBI surveillance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamdan|first=Sarah Shik|year=2013|title=Why library cards offer more privacy rights than proof of citizenship: Librarian ethics and Freedom of Information Act requestor policies|url=|journal=Government Information Quarterly|volume=30|pages=134|via=Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== USA PATRIOT Act ====
In 2003, the ALA passed a resolution opposing the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], which called sections of the law "a present danger to the constitutional rights and privacy rights of library users".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date =2003-01-29 | url =http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/statementspols/ifresolutions/resolutionusa | title =Resolution on the USA PATRIOT Act and Related Measures that Infringe on the Rights of Library Users | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2010-09-01 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120203034603/http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/statementspols/ifresolutions/resolutionusa | archivedate =2012-02-03 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the ALA and its members have sought to change the law by working with members of Congress and educating their communities and the press about the law's potential to violate the privacy rights of library users. ALA has also participated as an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' in lawsuits filed by individuals challenging the constitutionality of the USA PATRIOT Act, including a lawsuit filed by four Connecticut librarians after the library consortium they managed was served with a [[national security letter]] seeking information about library users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Cowan | first = Alison Leigh | date = 2006-05-31 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/31/nyregion/31library.html?ex=1306728000&amp;en=9f197630a8f4a0a9&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss | title = Four Librarians Finally Break Silence in Records Case | work = The New York Times | accessdate =2007-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several months of litigation, the lawsuit was dismissed when the FBI decided to withdraw the National Security Letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2006-06-26 |url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/FBI_drops_demand_for_information_from_0626.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6I7WHRqQX?url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/FBI_drops_demand_for_information_from_0626.html |archivedate=2013-07-15 |deadurl=no |title=FBI drops demand for information from Connecticut library group |work=Raw Story |accessdate=2007-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the "Connecticut Four" were honored by the ALA with the Paul Howard Award for Courage for their challenge to the National Security Letter and gag order provision of the USA PATRIOT Act.&lt;ref&gt;McCook, Kathleen de la Peña (2011), ''Introduction to Public Librarianship, '' pp. 63&amp;ndash;64. 2nd ed. New York, Neal-Schuman.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the ALA sold humorous "radical militant librarian" buttons for librarians to wear in support of the ALA's stances on intellectual freedom, privacy, and civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/archive/radicalbutton | title ="Radical, Militant Librarian" Button | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2010-09-01 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20121024044804/http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/archive/radicalbutton | archivedate =2012-10-24 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspiration for the button's design came from documents obtained from the FBI by the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] (EPIC) through a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request. The request revealed a series of e-mails in which FBI agents complained about the "radical, militant librarians" while criticizing the reluctance of FBI management to use the secret warrants authorized under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date=2006-01-17 |url=http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=pressreleases&amp;template=/contentmanagement/contentdisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=113573 |title=ALA introduces "Radical, Militant Librarian" button |publisher=ALA |accessdate=2007-03-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404072818/http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=pressreleases&amp;template=%2Fcontentmanagement%2Fcontentdisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=113573 |archivedate=4 April 2007 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaming of Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal===
In 2018, the organization changed the name of the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal to the [[Children's Literature Legacy Award]]. According to the ''New York Times'', the name change was made "in order to distance the honor" from what the ALA described as "culturally insensitive portrayals" in Wilder's books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chokshi |first1=Niraj |title=Prestigious Laura Ingalls Wilder Award Renamed Over Racial Insensitivity |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/books/laura-ingalls-wilder-book-award.html |accessdate=19 September 2018 |publisher=New York Times |date=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Krásna Hôrka 1.JPG|thumb|330px|right| A castle, the symbol of the rule of aristocracy in medieval Europe ([[Krásna Hôrka]] in [[Slovakia]]).]]

The '''aristocracy''' is a [[social class]] that a particular society considers its highest order. In many states, the aristocracy included the [[upper class]] of people (''aristocrats'') with hereditary rank and titles. In some—such as ancient Greece, Rome and India—aristocratic status came from belonging to a military [[caste]], although it has also been common, notably in African societies, for aristocrats to belong to priestly dynasties. Aristocratic status can involve feudal or legal privileges.&lt;ref&gt;''The aristocrats: a portrait of Britain's nobility and their way of life today'', by Roy Perrott, (London 1968), page5-10&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually below only the monarch of a [[country]] or [[nation]] in its [[social hierarchy]]. In modern European societies, the aristocracy has often coincided with the [[nobility]], a specific class that arose in the [[Middle Ages]], but the term "aristocracy" is sometimes also applied to other [[elite]]s, and is used as a more generic term when describing earlier and non-European societies.

==Etymology==
The term ''aristocracy'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀριστοκρατία (''[[aristocracy|aristokratia]]'' from ἄριστος (''aristos'') "excellent," and κράτος (''kratos'') "power."&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to British History'', John Cannon (Editor), [[Oxford University Press]], 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-19-866176-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, aristocratic titles were and are hereditary.

The term "''aristokratia''" was first used in [[Athens]] with reference to young [[citizen]]s (the men of the ruling class) who led armies at the front line. Due to [[martial]] bravery being highly regarded as a [[virtue]] in [[ancient Greece]], it was assumed that the armies were being led by "the best." This virtue was called ''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'' ([[wiktionary:ἀρετή|ἀρετή]]). Etymologically, as the word developed, it also produced a more political term: ''[[aristoi]]'' ([[wiktionary:ἄριστος|ἄριστοι]]). The term aristocracy is a compound word stemming from the singular of aristoi, ''aristos'' ([[wiktionary:ἄριστος|ἄριστος]]), and the Greek word for power, ''kratos'' ([[wiktionary: κράτος|κράτος]]).

From the ancient Greeks, the term passed to the European [[Middle Ages]] for a similar ''hereditary class'' of military leaders, often referred to as [[Nobility#European nobility|the nobility]]. As in Greece, this was a class of privileged men and women whose familial connections to the regional armies allowed them to present themselves as the most "noble" or "best" of society.

==Europe==

{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Historically, the status and privileges of the aristocracy in Europe were below [[royal family|royalty]] and above all non-aristocrats.

The [[French Revolution]] attacked aristocrats as people who had achieved their status by having been born in a wealthy family rather than by [[:wikt:merit|merit]], and this was considered unjust. In the [[United Kingdom]] and other European countries, such as Spain and Denmark, in which [[hereditary titles]] are still recognised, ''aristocrat'' still refers to the descendant of one of approximately 7,000 families with hereditary titles, many still in possession of considerable wealth.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, members of the highest echelon of the aristocracy, the [[hereditary peer]]s were, [[House of Lords Act 1999|until 1999]], members of the [[House of Lords]]—the [[upper house]] of the [[legislature]], the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. In 1999, most ceased to be members. However, the [[Duke of Norfolk]], who always serves as [[Earl Marshal]], the hereditary peer who serves as [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] (currently the [[Marquess of Cholmondeley]]), and a further 90 [[Representative peer|Representative Hereditary Peers]] elected by the Hereditary Peers retained membership. [[Life Peerages Act 1958|Since 1958, non-hereditary "life peers" have been created]], who are automatically members of the House of Lords for life with the right to be known by their title. For example, [[John Gummer]] became (The Rt Hon.) Lord Deben.

However, life peers are not considered part of the aristocracy, nor are knights, unless born into an aristocratic or [[landed gentry]] family.{{fact|date=October 2018}} Examples include [[James Douglas-Hamilton, Baron Selkirk of Douglas]], and [[Sir Winston Churchill]]—all born into aristocratic families. Besides the hereditary peers, the [[Gentry|gentry]] (consisting of [[baronet]]s, [[Scottish feudal barony|Scottish barons]], [[Laird|lairds]], [[Esquire|esquires]], [[Gentleman|gentlemen]], and any other untitled landowning [[armigerous]] families) are also considered part of the aristocracy.{{fact|date=October 2018}} Unlike the Continental untitled nobility, British untitled families that belong to the gentry have no legal recognition of their aristocratic position.

==India==
[[File:Salimullah.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Nawab]] Sir [[Khwaja Salimullah]], [[zamindar]] of [[Dhaka Nawab Family|Dhaka]].]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Under the rule of the [[Mughal Empire]], the titles for those under a king were borrowed from [[Persia]]. These titles of [[landed aristocracy]] include ''[[jagirdar]]'', ''[[thikana]]dar'', ''[[talukdar]]'', and ''[[zamindar]]''.

Many landholding families either held legal or administrative offices, and were sometimes considered the Indian version of the Nobility of the Robe. The princes appointed officers, such as ''dewan'' and other state level ministers, to run their administrations, who were considered members of the regional nobility. Most of these officers were either relatives of the princes who appointed them, or were themselves substantial landlords under the sovereignty of the Princely States, and most held hereditary titles. Sometimes, educated men belonging to the British Imperial Services were also appointed to the high offices of the Princely States, but their positions were not hereditary and they were seen as career bureaucrats rather than noblemen by their employers.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Today, aristocratic titles like [[Taluqdar]], [[Rai (title)|Rai]], [[Rao (title)|Rao]], [[Roy]], [[Chaudhary]], [[Sardar]], [[Zaildar]], [[Jagirdar]], [[Tarafdar]],  [[Thakur (Indian title)|Thakur]], [[Nair]], [[Madampi (Nair title)|Madampi]] are still used in the Indian Subcontinent.

==Nigeria==
{{main|Nigerian traditional rulers}}
Deriving mostly from the pre-colonial states of the region that would become known as [[Nigeria]], the legally recognised titles of the Nigerian aristocracy range from ''[[king]]'' to the ubiquitous ''[[tribal chief|chief]]''. They give their bearers no political authority in theory, but in practice allow them to serve as immensely powerful patrons of the country's political leaders due to their control of popular opinion within its various [[tribe]]s. Along with those of their titled relatives and courtiers, they also serve as the guiding forces behind Nigerian cultural and religious ceremonies. 

Titles such as [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]], Amanyanaboh, [[Sayfawa dynasty|Mai]], Obong, [[Sokoto Caliphate|Sarki]], Attah, and [[Obi (ruler)|Obi]] are used by the dynastic heads, while ''[[prince]]'' and ''[[princess]]'' are either used in their English forms or in their native ones by the dynasts of their houses. Their privy counsellors, meanwhile, tend to be called either ''[[chieftain|chiefs]]'' or ''[[elder (administrative title)|elders]]'' depending on what their monarchs are themselves called, with chiefs serving under a ruler who is called a king and elders serving under one called a chief.

==China==
{{main|Chinese nobility}}
The nobility of China was an important feature of the traditional social and political organization of Imperial China. While the concepts of hereditary sovereign and peerage titles and noble families were featured as early as the semi-mythical early historical period, a settled system of nobility was established from the [[Zhou dynasty]]. In the subsequent millennia, this system was largely maintained in form, with some changes and additions, although the content constantly evolved. The last well-developed system of noble titles was established under the [[Qing dynasty]].

==Origin==
The first known use of Obama's image being "Jokerized" was published on Myspace by a user listed as Ross Brummet in August 2008.  The image was of a smiling Barack Obama, his face painted over with Joker-style makeup, and the quote "The U.S. deserves a better class of war criminal, and I'm going to give it to them."&lt;ref&gt;Brummet, Ross (August, 2008) [https://myspace.com/agnostic_vegetarian/mixes/classic-villians-352632/photo/81251107 Obama photo], (myspace.com) Retrieved December 25, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A second instance, and the first to receive media coverage,  occurred at a rally for Vice Presidential candidate [[Joe Biden]] at [[Florida State University]] on November 2, 2008.&lt;ref name=cbsnews&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-502443_162-4563984-502443.html | title=Biden Jabs Anti-Obama Protesters At Fla. Rally | last=Corsaro | first=Ryan | date=November 2, 2008 | work=[[CBS]] | publisher=cbsnews.com | accessdate=August 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two members of the FSU College Republicans created the poster from an [[Barack Obama "Hope" poster|Obama "Hope" poster]] they had purchased from the school's College Democrats club, and used it to demonstrate outside the Biden event. This design featured the caption "Why So Socialist?", a parody of ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''{{'}}s "Why So Serious" tagline.&lt;ref name=abcnews&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/11/bidens-florida.html | title=Biden's Florida Rally Disrupted by Protesters | last=Jaffe | first=Matt | date=November 2, 2008 | work=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] | publisher=abcnews.com | accessdate=August 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The students dismissed criticism of the poster, explaining that it was simply a pop culture reference designed to "get the attention of a college audience".&lt;ref name=theyetimagazine&gt;{{cite news | url=http://issuu.com/theyeti/docs/theyeti_december/4 | title=Obama Jokerface is an FSU Original | last=Hertz | first=Rebecca | date=December 2010 | work=[[The Yeti]] | publisher=theyetionline.com | accessdate=December 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The version of the image that was eventually popularized was created by Alkhateeb, a 20-year-old [[Palestinian American]] history student at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbsnews2&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/08/18/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry5249795.shtml | title=Artist Behind Obama "Joker" Picture Revealed | last=Hechtkopf | first=Kevin | date=August 18, 2009 | work=[[CBS News]] | publisher=cbsnews.com | accessdate=September 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He digitally manipulated the Obama photograph from the October 2006 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover, using [[Adobe Photoshop]]. His version did not contain the "[[socialism]]" label. Alkhateeb was influenced by artist [[Shepard Fairey]], designer of the [[Barack Obama "Hope" poster|Obama "Hope" poster]], and wanted to practice a "Jokerize" technique he learned in class.&lt;ref name=thenational/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbsnews2/&gt;  He digitally added the Joker face paint over the Obama image and uploaded it to Flickr on January 18, 2009.&lt;ref name=cbsnews2/&gt;  Alkhateeb is said to have had no ill-will towards Obama, but was simply bored.&lt;ref name=timesonline&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6800675.ece | title=Author of 'shocking, racist' Obama Joker image unveiled - as a bored history student | last=Booth | first=Jenny | date=August 18, 2009 | work=[[The Times]] | publisher=timesonline.co.uk | accessdate=September 25, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image went largely unnoticed until an unknown person began placing posters of the image, with the added label "socialism," throughout downtown [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].&lt;ref name=unmasked&gt;{{cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/08/obama-joker-artist.html | title=Obama Joker artist unmasked: A fellow Chicagoan|last=Milian | first=Mark | date=August 17, 2009 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | publisher=latimesblogs.latimes.com | accessdate=September 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=downtown&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2009/08/05/2009-08-05_president_obama_rolling_stone.html | title=Shepard Fairey-designed Obama portrait on cover of Rolling Stone deifies, questions President | last=Kennedy | first=Helen | date=August 6, 2009 | work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | publisher=nydailynews.com | accessdate=September 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2009, ''Bedlam'' magazine became the first [[Mass media|media outlet]] to report on Obama "Joker" signs being spotted in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=bedlam&gt;{{cite news | url=http://bedlammagazine.com/06news/mystery-obamajoker-poster-appears-la | title=Mystery Obama/Joker Poster Appears in L.A. | last=Jerald | first=Jonathan | date=April 25, 2009 | work=Bedlam Magazine | publisher=bedlammagazine.com | accessdate=September 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reason&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/135293.html | title=The Artist Formerly Known as Dissident | last=Courrielche | first=Patrick | date=August 7, 2009 | work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] | publisher=reason.com | accessdate=September 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the summer months, Obama "Joker" posters were distributed in [[Florida]] and [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name=presstv&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=105622&amp;sectionid=351020605 |title=Obama on Estonia airport 'trash cans' |date=September 8, 2009 |work=[[Press TV]] |publisher=presstv.ir |accessdate=September 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920002454/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=105622&amp;sectionid=351020605 |archivedate=September 20, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2009, the posters became a [[viral phenomenon]] online.

==Criticism==
Some [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] have called the image racist, suggesting a similarity to [[blackface]] makeup that was used during [[minstrel show]] performances.&lt;ref name=dailytelegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/17/us/politics/17obama.html | title=As Race Debate Grows, Obama Steers Clear of It | last=Zeleny | first=Jeff |author2=Rutenberg, Jim | date=September 16, 2009 | work=[[The New York Times]] | publisher=nytimes.com | pages=A1 | accessdate=September 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Earl Ofari Hutchinson]], president of the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, said, "Depicting the president as demonic and a socialist goes beyond political spoofery. It is mean-spirited and dangerous. We have issued a public challenge to the person or group that put up the poster to come forth and publicly tell why they have used this offensive depiction to ridicule President Obama."&lt;ref name=dailytelegraph/&gt;

Ray Tampa, president of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) chapter in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], [[Florida]], had a differing opinion: "I see it as the Joker, and being that I see it as the Joker I will have to say that it's fair game".&lt;ref name=petersburg&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/state/pinellas-gop-denies-link-to-facebook-page-with-image-of-obama-as-joker/1024830 | title=Pinellas GOP denies link to Facebook page with image of Obama as Joker | last=Smith | first=Adam C. | date=August 5, 2009 | work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] | publisher=tampabay.com | accessdate=September 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alkhateeb, in response to the usage of his image, said, "To accuse [Obama]&lt;!--replaces "him" in original, *not* a link--&gt; of being a socialist is really ... immature. First of all, who said being a socialist is evil?"&lt;ref name=cbsnews2/&gt;  He also stated "socialism is an idea thats time has come and passed. It’s basically like calling someone a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist to the British crown]]".&lt;ref name=thenational/&gt;

'''Elizabeth McCaughey''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|k|ɔɪ}}; born '''Elizabeth Helen Peterken''', October 20, 1948),&lt;ref name="woman in the news"/&gt; formerly known as '''Betsy McCaughey Ross''', is an American politician who was the [[Lieutenant Governor of New York]] from 1995 to 1998, during the first term of Governor [[George Pataki]]. She unsuccessfully sought the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nomination for governor after Pataki dropped her from his 1998 ticket, and she ended up on the ballot under the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]] line. In August 2016 the [[Donald Trump]] [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]] announced that she had joined the campaign as an economic adviser.&lt;ref name="COTTLE"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=COTTLE|first1=MICHELLE|title=Is Betsy McCaughey Too Perfect a Match for Donald Trump?|journal=The Atlantic|date=August 14, 2016|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/betsy-mccaughey-donald-trump/495758/|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A historian by training, with a [[Ph.D.|PhD]] from [[Columbia University]], McCaughey has, over the years, provided [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] media commentary on US public policy affecting healthcare-related issues. Her 1993 attack on the Clinton healthcare plan was likely a major factor in the initially-popular bill's defeat in Congress. Also, it brought her to the attention of Republican Pataki, who chose her as his nominee/running mate. In 2009, her criticisms of the [[Affordable Care Act]], then a bill being debated in Congress, again gained significant media attention in television and radio interviews, and it may have specifically inspired the "[[death panel]]" claim about the act.

She has been a fellow at the conservative [[Manhattan Institute]] and [[Hudson Institute]] thinktanks and has written numerous articles and [[op-ed]]s. She was a member of the boards of directors of medical equipment companies [[Genta (company)|Genta]] (from 2001 to 2007) and [[Cantel Medical Corporation]], but she resigned in 2009 to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest with her public advocacy against the Affordable Care Act.

She was married to business magnate [[Wilbur Ross]], the current [[Secretary of Commerce]], from 1995 until their divorce five years later in 2000.

==Early life, education, and family==
McCaughey and her twin brother, William, were born in [[Pittsburgh]] to Albert Peterken, a factory janitor, and his wife, Ramona.&lt;ref name="Linstedt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="unreal"/&gt; The family moved around the [[Northeastern United States]] for six years before it settled down in [[Westport, Connecticut]],&lt;ref name="woman in the news"/&gt; where McCaughey's father did maintenance and later engineering work at a nail clipper factory.&lt;ref name="Schwartzman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="soap opera"/&gt; McCaughey recalled her parents' difficulty in affording medical treatment: "my brother was a serious asthmatic as a child. I remember my parents sitting at the kitchen table wondering if they could afford to take [him] to the hospital."&lt;ref name="woman in the news"/&gt;

McCaughey attended public schools in Westport through the 10th grade, spending much of her free time at the library.&lt;ref name="Schwartzman"/&gt; After receiving a scholarship, she transferred to a private Massachusetts boarding school, the [[Stoneleigh-Burnham School#History of Stoneleigh-Burnham School|Mary A. Burnham School]], for her last two years of high school, rarely visiting home, then or during her college years.&lt;ref name="Schwartzman"/&gt;

She received a scholarship to attend [[Vassar College]], where she majored in history.&lt;ref name="Schwartzman"/&gt; She wrote her senior [[senior thesis#United States|thesis]] on [[Karl Marx]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],&lt;ref name="Schwartzman"/&gt; won several fellowships, and received her [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]], with distinction, in 1970.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt; McCaughey went on to graduate school at Columbia University in [[New York City]], earning her [[Master of Arts#United States|MA]] in 1972 and her PhD in [[history of the United States Constitution|constitutional history]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt;

She won Columbia's Bancroft Dissertation Award in American History in 1976&lt;ref name="dissertation award"/&gt; and her dissertation was published by the prestigious [[Columbia University Press]] in 1980, ''From Loyalist to Founding Father: The Political Odyssey of [[William Samuel Johnson]]:'.&lt;ref name="book published"/&gt;

She also contributed a chapter about Johnson to the 1979 book ''The American Revolution: Changing Perspectives'' by [[William M. Fowler]] and Wallace Coyle.&lt;ref name="chapter published"/&gt;

While completing her PhD, McCaughey trained in the corporate banking department at [[Chase (bank)|Chase Manhattan Bank]], and she served as a [[loan officer]] in the Food, Beverage, and Tobacco Division.&lt;ref name="committee to reduce"/&gt; She also took courses in accounting at Columbia's School of Business.&lt;ref name="committee to reduce"/&gt;

McCaughey's father died in 1970 at the age of 60. Her mother, an alcoholic, died the next year of liver disease at the age of 42.&lt;ref name="Schwartzman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TNR-5Oct09"/&gt; In 1972, she married Thomas K. McCaughey, a [[Yale College]] graduate she had met in college. He was then moving up as an [[investment banking|investment banker]].&lt;ref name="Bumiller"/&gt; The McCaugheys separated in 1992 and divorced in 1994, with McCaughey and her ex-spouse sharing joint custody of their three daughters.&lt;ref name="nuptials"/&gt; In January 1993, she filed an affidavit in her divorce proceeding in which she said she had no annual earnings from employment during most of the 18 years of her marriage to Thomas, and she had never earned more than $20,000 per year except in 1990, when she "sold an idea to Fox television for a windfall once-in-a-lifetime sum of $75,000."&lt;ref name="Bumiller"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vasisht"/&gt;

She married wealthy investment banker and prominent Democratic Party fundraiser [[Wilbur Ross, Jr.]] in December 1995.&lt;ref name="vows"/&gt; He filed for divorce in November 1998.&lt;ref name="hearing ordered"/&gt;

==Academic work, 1977–1988==
McCaughey taught history as a visiting assistant professor at [[Vassar College]] in 1977–1978 and was a lecturer in 1979–1980. She was an assistant professor at between 1981 and 1983, teaching two classes per year, both at [[Columbia University]] Between 1983 and 1984, she had a [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] [[Postdoctoral research|postdoctoral fellowship]].&lt;ref name="Bumiller"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vasisht"/&gt; From 1986 to 1988, she served as a guest [[curator]] at the [[New-York Historical Society]] and was responsible for the museum's exhibit commemorating the bicentennial of the [[US Constitution]].&lt;ref name="government by choice"/&gt; She also authored a book, ''Government by Choice: Inventing the United States Constitution'', which cataloged the exhibit.&lt;ref name="government by choice"/&gt;

==Policy positions and scholarship, 1989–1993==
In the late 1980s, McCaughey briefly considered a career in TV news,&lt;ref name="Schwartzman"/&gt; but she opted instead for a position as a senior scholar at the [[Center for the Study of the Presidency]], serving from 1989 to 1992. There, she wrote an article, book reviews, and a guest editorial for its journal, ''Presidential Studies Quarterly (PSQ)'',&lt;ref name="marbury"/&gt; and an [[op-ed]] in ''USA Today'' advocating reform of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] method of electing the president.&lt;ref name="nightmare"/&gt; She testified at a July 22, 1992 hearing before the [[United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution]]&lt;ref name="electoral college"/&gt; and helped produce a report suggesting [[List of methods of constitutional amendment#United States|constitutional amendments]] to fix perceived flaws in the Electoral College.&lt;ref name="electoral college"/&gt;&lt;ref name="at risk"/&gt;

McCaughey also wrote op-ed columns that appeared in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and ''[[USA Today]]'' in which she opposed plans involving local and state [[redistricting]] to comply with the [[Voting Rights Act]],&lt;ref name="voting rights act"/&gt; and she criticized federal court-ordered [[desegregation]] of schools in [[Connecticut]] and [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="school integration"/&gt; She also supported the nomination of a federal judge, [[Clarence Thomas]] to the [[United States Supreme Court]] by arguing that he would judge cases there on their merits and not tend to interpret cases in a manner consistent with his conservative beliefs;&lt;ref name="Schwartzman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="the real Thomas"/&gt; She also supported a [[Tobacco company#Industry outlook in the United States|tobacco company in litigation]] before the Supreme Court&lt;ref name="cigarette"/&gt; and praised the 1992 ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' Supreme Court decision, restricting [[abortion]] rights.&lt;ref name="abortion ruling"/&gt;

In February 1993, the [[John M. Olin Foundation]] funded a fellowship at the [[Manhattan Institute]], a conservative [[think tank]], for McCaughey to write a book on race and the legal system to be titled ''Beyond Pluralism: Overcoming the Narcissism of Minor Differences''. McCaughey wrote op-eds over the next six months in ''The Wall Street Journal'' and ''USA Today'' in which she supported the 1993 [[jury selection|selection of a jury]] from predominately-white, Republican, rural counties for the urban (Memphis)-located retrial of African American and Democratic US Representative [[Harold Ford, Sr.]],&lt;ref name="like justice"/&gt; and praised the 1993 ''[[Shaw v. Reno]]'' Supreme Court decision, favoring five white voters who said their rights had been infringed upon by [[redistricting]] that had been done to comply with the [[Voting Rights Act]].&lt;ref name="gerrymandering"/&gt;

==Healthcare reform, 1993–1994==
On September 22, 1993, US President [[Bill Clinton]] delivered a nationally televised speech about his healthcare reform plan to a joint session of Congress. From September 28 to 30, 1993, First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]], the architect of the [[universal health care]] plan, testified about its details before five [[United States congressional committee|US congressional committees]]. The cost of providing insurance for the estimated 37 million people then uninsured was to be covered in part by [[cigarette taxes in the United States|new taxes on tobacco]].&lt;ref name="dickinson3"/&gt; On the last day of Hillary Clinton's testimony, ''The Wall Street Journal'' published an op-ed by McCaughey, who wrote that the 239-page draft legislation differed markedly from the White House's public statements and would have "devastating consequences".&lt;ref name="Porter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="devilish"/&gt; Citing words and phrases from the draft, she argued that the 77 percent of Americans then covered by insurance would see a downgrade in their policies, and most would not be able to keep their own physicians but be forced into price-controlled [[health maintenance organizations]] (HMOs), which would provide only the most basic care.&lt;ref name="devilish"/&gt; According to McCaughey, the HMO plans would not pay for visits to specialists or for second opinions, and most physicians would be driven out of private practice.&lt;ref name="devilish"/&gt;

In late November 1993, the bill for the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993]] was introduced in the Congress and made publicly available. ''The Wall Street Journal'' then published an op-ed by McCaughey in which said she had pored over the entire bill and concluded that it had [[price controls]] that would cause [[health care rationing|rationing]], and the bill was dangerous.&lt;ref name="price controls"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurtz"/&gt;

McCaughey expanded her op-eds into a five-page article titled "No Exit", which appeared as the cover story in ''[[The New Republic]]'' and was published a few days before President Clinton's 1994 [[State of the Union address]].&lt;ref name="no exit"/&gt; An internal memo by tobacco company [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]], dated March 1994, indicated that representatives of Philip Morris had collaborated with McCaughey when she was writing "No Exit":&lt;ref name="dickinson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="legacy tobacco"/&gt; "Worked off-the-record with Manhattan and writer Betsy McCaughey as part of the input to the three-part exposé in The New Republic on what the Clinton plan means to you. The first part detailed specifics of the plan."&lt;ref name="legacy tobacco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dickinson2"/&gt; (When the memo was discussed in a 2009 story in ''Rolling Stone'', McCaughey declined to comment.)&lt;ref name="dickinson3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dickinson"/&gt;

McCaughey's "No Exit" article was quickly used by conservative officials and commentators seeking to discredit the Clinton plan.&lt;ref name="misinformation"/&gt; Senator [[Bob Dole]], in the Republican Party response to the President's State of the Union, used some of McCaughey's arguments of fewer choices, lower quality, and more government control.&lt;ref name="president insists"/&gt; [[Bill Kristol]]'s Project for the Republican Future quickly launched television advertisements featuring quotes from McCaughey's two ''Wall Street Journal'' op-ed columns and her ''The New Republic'' article. ''[[Newsweek]]'' columnist [[George Will]] used McCaughey's writings as a basis for predicting that the Clinton health plan would kill patients and make it illegal for patients to pay doctors directly for care, with 15-year jail terms for patients who tried to do so.&lt;ref name="lethal paternalism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revolution"/&gt;

The Clinton White House press office issued a response to McCaughey's "No Exit" article by arguing that it contained "numerous factual inaccuracies and misleading statements."&lt;ref name="analysis of article"/&gt; McCaughey responded that her claims came "straight from the text of the bill."&lt;ref name="she's baaack"/&gt; Supporters of the Clinton plan questioned McCaughey's claims, including her statements that "the law will prevent you from going outside the system to buy basic health coverage you think is better" and that "doctor[s] can be paid only by the plan, not by you" by pointing to the text of the legislation such as Section 1003: "Nothing in this Act shall be construed as prohibiting... An individual from purchasing any health care services."&lt;ref name="H.R. 3600"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-103hr3600ih/pdf/BILLS-103hr3600ih.pdf|title=H.R. 3600, The Health Security Act, Title I, Subtitle A|date=February 4, 1994|pages=15–16|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|quote=SEC. 1003. PROTECTION OF CONSUMER CHOICE. Nothing in this Act shall be construed as prohibiting the following: (1) An individual from purchasing any health care services. (2) An individual from purchasing supplemental insurance (offered consistent with this Act) to cover health care services not included within the comprehensive benefit package.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="misinformation"/&gt;

According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the "No Exit" article, the White House response, and the ensuing television and radio interviews with McCaughey made her a star: "Her toothy good looks, body-conscious suits, Vassar BA and Columbia PhD reduced right-wingers to mush."&lt;ref name="Bumiller"/&gt;

The bill stalled and died in Congress in 1994, and the next year, Clinton was reduced to asking Congress for a series of small, incremental reforms to healthcare.&lt;ref name="centrist"/&gt; The "No Exit" article won the [[National Magazine Award]] for excellence in the public interest. [[Andrew Sullivan]], the editor of ''The New Republic'', later stated that he believed there were flaws in McCaughey's article, but he ran it "as a provocation to debate."&lt;ref name="answering ezra"/&gt; In 2006, a new editor recanted the story.&lt;ref name="the fixer"/&gt;

In 2009, ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' called her "The Woman Who Killed Health Care".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Woman Who Killed Health Care|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2009/05/15/the-woman-who-killed-health-care.html#url=/articles/2009/05/15/the-woman-who-killed-health-care.html|last=Sarlin|first=Benjamin|work=Daily Beast|date=May 15, 2009|accessdate=April 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York Lieutenant Governorship, 1995–1998==
Following the national attention McCaughey received in the 1990s healthcare legislation debate, Pataki, a first-term New York state senator who was running for governor, chose her as his running mate. Despite McCaughey's complete lack of experience as a political candidate or officeholder and the fact that Pataki did not personally know McCaughey, Pataki perceived that she was very popular among conservatives, who, at the time, were still suspicious of him and that her public image would make his longshot candidacy more appealing to independent and female voters.&lt;ref name="following up"/&gt; Regarding her status as a political rookie, McCaughey said, "Many New Yorkers see that as a plus."&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt;

McCaughey said that she accepted the nomination by believing she would be Pataki's "point person on health policy."&lt;ref name="doesn't need"/&gt; After winning the election, Pataki told ''The New York Times'', McCaughey would have "very real and significant responsibilities" as lieutenant governor.&lt;ref name="real role"/&gt; McCaughey was initially tasked by Pataki to work on education policy and on reducing New York's [[Medicaid]] budget.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt; By January 1995, McCaughey had produced a set of recommendations that required cost cutting by hospitals and nursing homes so that the poor did not have to bear the entire burden of balancing the state's Medicaid budget by a reduction of their benefits.&lt;ref name="woman in the news"/&gt; However, McCaughey's recommendations were largely ignored.&lt;ref name="bait"/&gt;

After Pataki refused to give McCaughey permission to conduct a study into child abuse, she did one anyway and publicly announced its results.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt; McCaughey was publicly critical of the governor's proposed cuts to Medicaid and gave a [[pro-choice]] speech without his advance permission.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt; In March 1996, ''The New York Times'' reported that McCaughey was locked out of the governor's inner circle because she had violated the "unwritten rules" of the conventional lieutenant governor's role.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt; Rather than following protocol as lieutenant governor by taking a seat with everyone else during Pataki's State of the State address to the legislature in 1996, McCaughey stood for the entire 56 min speech's length, further attracting attention to herself at her governor's expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schwartzman |first=Paul |date=June 2, 1996| title=Lt. Gov Gets GOP Dissing | newspaper=New York Daily News | accessdate=November 14, 2013 | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/lt-gov-gop-dissing-article-1.714959#ixzz2kfMxrc00 | quote=In perhaps the most bizarre element of this episode, McCaughey stood behind Governor Pataki, in full view of the camera, displaying an unflinching, toothsome smile for the duration of Pataki's speech.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1997, Governor Pataki announced that McCaughey would not be his running mate when he ran for re-election in 1998. He later selected [[New York State Supreme Court]] Justice [[Mary Donohue]] to replace her.

Though she had always voted Republican in presidential elections and taken conservative Republican policy positions, McCaughey suddenly switched her party affiliation to Democrat and soon announced plans to run for governor against Pataki.&lt;ref name="Schwartzman"/&gt; McCaughey was the early frontrunner for her new party's nomination process,&lt;ref name="double jeopardy"/&gt; in part because of her statewide name and face recognition and in part because of the financial support of her wealthy then-husband.&lt;ref name="husband meet"/&gt; During her campaign for governor, she was criticized for firing a succession of campaign aides and political advisers and possibly changing her core political beliefs in order to appear more electable to New York voters.&lt;ref name="Schwartzman"/&gt; As her opinion poll numbers sank, her husband took away more than half of the funds he had pledged to her campaign.&lt;ref name="TNR-5Oct09"/&gt;

McCaughey was defeated in the Democratic [[primary election]] by New York City Councilman [[Peter Vallone]] (who then lost the general election to Pataki, 54 percent to 33 percent). McCaughey had earlier received the nomination of the [[Liberal Party of New York]] for governor and stayed in the general election. McCaughey's campaign attracted little support, and she received only 1.65 percent of the general vote for governor.&lt;ref name="election results 98"/&gt; Following the election, she divorced and then sued her former husband alleging "$40 million fraud," claiming that he promised to fund her campaign unconditionally.&lt;ref name="TNR-5Oct09"/&gt;

[[File:Lt. Governor of New York Betsy McCaughey at -FITN in Nashua, NH (17213956531).jpg|thumb|right|McCaughey in 2015]]
McCaughey has worked on patient advocacy and healthcare policy issues since leaving office in 1999. She was senior fellow at the conservative [[Hudson Institute]] beginning in 1999 and an adjunct senior fellow beginning in 2002.&lt;ref name="committee to reduce"/&gt; She was a member of the board of directors of [[Genta (company)|Genta]], a company focused on the delivery of innovative products for cancer treatment from 2001 to her resignation in October 2007.&lt;ref name="genta resignation"/&gt; She was also a member of the board of directors of the [[Cantel Medical Corporation]], a medical device manufacturer, from 2005 to her resignation in August 2009 to avoid the appearance a conflict of interest while she was engaged in advocacy on healthcare reform legislation.&lt;ref name="cantel resignation"/&gt;

In 2004, she founded the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths (RID) in reaction to a rise in [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus#Hospital patients|antibiotic resistant staphylococcus aureus]] and other hospital-borne infections.&lt;ref name="what is rid"/&gt; The non-profit RID is "devoted solely to providing safer, cleaner, hospital care".&lt;ref name="rid info"/&gt; She remains the chair and representative of the organization.&lt;ref name="rid info"/&gt; She has appeared on ''Fox News'', ''CNN'', and many radio shows to discuss her research and how to prevent infection deaths.&lt;ref name="committee to reduce"/&gt; Her organization's efforts have led to legislation in more than 25 states requiring hospitals to report infections.&lt;ref name="committee to reduce"/&gt;

==Healthcare reform, 2007–2009==

===American Cancer Society===
In August 2007, the [[American Cancer Society]] dedicated $15 million to a public awareness campaign on inadequate access to healthcare for the 47 million Americans not covered by insurance.&lt;ref name="cancer society focuses"/&gt;&lt;ref name="access to care"/&gt; It claimed that there would be a greater decline in cancer deaths if more cases of cancer were diagnosed in the early stages.&lt;ref name="cancer society focuses"/&gt; The society noted that studies had shown that patients without insurance were more than twice as likely to have their cancer diagnosed in the late stages of the disease.&lt;ref name="cancer society focuses"/&gt; One of the cancer society's commercials stated, "We're making progress, but it's not enough if people don't have access to the care that could save their lives."&lt;ref name="cancer society focuses"/&gt;

McCaughey criticized the campaign, saying that it should instead refocus on educating people about cancer prevention and detection.&lt;ref name="cancer killers"/&gt; She argued that evidence had shown that the US had higher rates of cancer survival than countries with universal healthcare coverage because of shorter wait times for treatment, better availability of new drugs for therapy, and more frequent cancer screenings.&lt;ref name="cancer killers"/&gt; She expanded her argument into a "Brief Analysis" published the following month by the [[National Center for Policy Analysis]] in which she maintained that the US was number one in the world in cancer care.&lt;ref name="brief analysis"/&gt; Sources for her analysis included a paper from the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], a non profit, non partisan research organization,&lt;ref name="health status"/&gt; and an article in the British medical journal ''[[The Lancet|Lancet Oncology]]'', which analyzed 2000–2002 cancer survival figures from Europe.&lt;ref name="lancet oncology article"/&gt; The American Cancer Society responded by citing a study of nearly 600,000 cancer cases that concluded that compared to people with private insurance, uninsured patients in the US were 1.6 times more likely to die within five years of their diagnosis.&lt;ref name="report links"/&gt;

===2009 stimulus bill===
McCaughey published an op-ed on February 9, 2009 and claimed that the Obama administration's pending [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] stimulus contained the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, hidden provisions that would harm the health of Americans as well as the healthcare sector of the economy.&lt;ref name="ruin"/&gt; She argued that the bill would establish two powerful new bureaucracies: the [[National Coordinator for Health Information Technology]] and the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research.&lt;ref name="ruin"/&gt;

McCaughey said the National Coordinator would monitor patients' electronic medical records to ensure that doctors and hospitals treated patients in a way that "the federal government deems appropriate and cost effective" and that doctors and hospitals deviating from the government's "electronically delivered protocols" would be penalized.&lt;ref name="ruin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poorly informed critics"/&gt; She said that the Federal Coordinating Council would be composed of appointed bureaucrats charged with a costcutting agenda that would slow the development of new medical products and drugs and ration healthcare for senior citizens.&lt;ref name="ruin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fcwrong"/&gt; She opined that the bureaucrats would use a comparative effectiveness formula, which, in the [[United Kingdom]], had resulted in a requirement that senior citizens go blind in one eye before the government would pay for a treatment to save the sight in the other eye.&lt;ref name="ruin"/&gt;

Critics claimed McCaughey's claims were distorted, pointing out that the National Coordinator was not new but had been created five years earlier by [[George W. Bush]]&lt;ref name="let's stop"/&gt; and that the 2009 legislation was not about limiting doctors' ability to prescribe treatments but instead establishing a system of electronic records to give physicians complete and accurate information their patients.&lt;ref name="benen"/&gt;

[[FactCheck.org]] noted that comparative effectiveness research had been funded by the US government for years but agreed with McCaughey that there would be penalties for health providers that did not use the electronic records system.&lt;ref name="fact check 2-20-09"/&gt; The effectiveness research council was a new initiative, as McCaughey had said. However, supporters of the stimulus bill provision said that research funded would provide additional evidence to guide treatment decisions and save lives and money by avoiding unnecessary, ineffective, or risky treatments.&lt;ref name="to compare"/&gt;

McCaughey's viewpoint was soon echoed and extended by conservative talk show host [[Rush Limbaugh]] and multiple [[Fox News Channel]] broadcasters.&lt;ref name="benen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="to compare"/&gt; Republican US Representative [[Charles Boustany|Charles Boustany Jr.]] of [[Louisiana]], a heart surgeon, added that he feared that comparative effectiveness research would be misused by federal bureaucrats to "ration care, to deny life-saving treatment to seniors and disabled people."&lt;ref name="to compare"/&gt; Other conservatives agreed that the legislation could put the federal government in the middle of the doctor-patient relationship.&lt;ref name="to compare"/&gt; The stimulus bill was passed with the healthcare-related provisions still included. McCaughey urged their repeal so that their potential impact could be studied further.&lt;ref name="fcwrong" /&gt;

===2009 healthcare reform bills===
McCaughey opposed the America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 debated in Congress in 2009. She made allegations about certain provisions of the bills that provided for Medicare payments to physicians for end-of-life and living will counseling and about [[Ezekiel Emanuel]], then an adviser to the Obama administration's budget director and chairman of the [[bioethics]] department at the National Institutes of Health.&lt;ref name="Pear"/&gt; McCaughey's claims may have inspired [[Sarah Palin]]'s more high-profile claims that the legislation would lead to so-called [[death panel]]s.&lt;ref name="strikes back"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Saltonstall/&gt;&lt;ref name="distortions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeadlyDoctors"/&gt; The provisions in the legislation that McCaughey advocated against were removed from the bill before it became law.

In July 2009, McCaughey claimed that a section in the pending healthcare legislation, "Advance Care Planning Consultation", actually prescribed "euthanasia for the elderly" because it included provisions that&lt;blockquote&gt;would make it mandatory — absolutely require — that every five years people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner [and inform them how to] decline nutrition, how to decline being hydrated, how to go in to hospice care ... all to do what's in society's best interest or in your family's best interest and cut your life short.&lt;ref name="otm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="counseling required"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/23/betsy-mccaughey/mccaughey-claims-end-life-counseling-will-be-requi/|title=McCaughey claims end-of-life counseling will be required for Medicare patients|author=Catharine Richert|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|work=PolitiFact|date=July 23, 2009|accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="euthanasia" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;McCaughey's choice of words and analysis were described by ''[[The Atlantic]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s [[James Fallows]] as inaccurate and sensationalistic.&lt;ref name="otm" /&gt; [[Politifact]] responded that the end-of-life counseling was voluntary, calling McCaughey's claim a "ridiculous falsehood" and giving it their lowest accuracy rating, "pants on fire".&lt;ref name="counseling required" /&gt;&lt;ref name="misled"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/13/sarah-palin/palin-claims-obama-misled-when-he-said-end-life-co/ |title=Palin claims Obama misled when he said end-of-life counseling is voluntary|author=Robert Farley |publisher=St. Petersburg Times|work=PolitiFact|date=August 13, 2009 |accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factcheck.org called the claims "nonsense" and stated that what that section of the bill would actually do is "require Medicare to pay for voluntary counseling sessions helping seniors to plan for end-of-life medical care, including designating a health care proxy, choosing a hospice and making decisions about life-sustaining treatment."&lt;ref name="euthanasia" /&gt; During an appearance on ''[[The Daily Show|The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'' which aired on August 20, 2009, McCaughey repeated these assertions about the counselling sessions and referred to the Factcheck.org as "spot-check dot org", claiming they failed to adequately read the House health care bill.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2009/08/spotcheckorg-we-disagree/|title='SpotCheck.org'? We Disagree|date=|publisher=Factcheck.org|accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a rebuttal, Factcheck.org stood by their analysis and provided further analysis, which led them to conclude that McCaughey had misinterpreted the bill.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In August 2009, [[WNYC]]'s ''[[On the Media]]'' also addressed McCaughey's claims, concluding that the provision actually mandated that the federal government compensate "counseling sessions" on elder law, such as estate planning, "will writing and hospice care."&lt;ref name="otm"/&gt;

McCaughey described Emanuel in a ''[[New York Post]]'' opinion article as a "Deadly Doctor" who advocated healthcare rationing by age and disability.&lt;ref name="DeadlyDoctors"/&gt;&lt;ref name="will bill"/&gt; Factcheck.org said this was incorrect and that "Emanuel's meaning is being twisted... he was talking about a philosophical trend, and... writing about how to make the most ethical choices when forced to choose which patients get organ transplants or vaccines when supplies are limited."&lt;ref name="false"/&gt; An article in ''Time'' magazine said that Emanuel "was only addressing extreme cases like organ donation, where there is an absolute scarcity of resources", and quoted Emanuel as saying: "My quotes were just being taken out of context."&lt;ref name="strikes back" /&gt; The ''New York Times'' noted that Emanuel had opposed the legalization of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide when such proposals were being debated in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Pear" /&gt;

McCaughey resigned from the Board of Cantel Medical Corporation on August 20, 2009 "to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest during the national debate over healthcare reform", according to a press release by the company.&lt;ref name="cantel resignation"/&gt; Other reports claimed that she resigned after negative reactions to her performance on ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart'' one day earlier.&lt;ref name="humiliating"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WashIndRid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="full show"/&gt;&lt;ref name="extended interview 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="extended interview 2"/&gt;

In an appearance on [[MSNBC]]'s ''Morning Meeting'' on October 6, 2009,&lt;ref name="McCaughey on MSNBC Morning Meeting 10-6-09"/&gt; McCaughey advocated gradually extending the minimum age for Medicare coverage upward from 65 to 70 in order to keep the Medicare system solvent.

In an August 7, 2012 opinion piece in ''The'' ''Wall Street Journal'', McCaughey described as "phony" an assertion that repealing the [[Affordable Care Act]] would increase federal deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390444860104577558723207171952 |title=Betsy McCaughey: ObamaCare's Phony Deficit Reduction – WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=August 7, 2012 |accessdate=October 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107150324/http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390444860104577558723207171952 |archive-date=January 7, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 15, 2013 opinion piece in the ''[[New York Post]]'' entitled "Obamacare will question your sex life", McCaughey wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;Are you sexually active? If so, with one partner, multiple partners or same-sex partners?" Be ready to answer those questions and more the next time you go to the doctor, whether it's the dermatologist or the cardiologist and no matter if the questions are unrelated to why you're seeking medical help. And you can thank the Obama health law.&lt;ref name="New York Post opinion piece"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2013/09/15/obamacare-will-question-your-sex-life/|title=Obamacare will question your sex life|last=McCaughey|first=Betsy|date=September 15, 2013|work=New York Post|publisher=|accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Politifact rated this assertion as "Pants on Fire",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/19/betsy-mccaughey/betsy-mccaughey-says-obamacare-will-question-your-/ |title=Betsy McCaughey says on next doctor visit, 'Obamacare will question your sex life' |publisher=PolitiFact |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and FactCheck.org also called it false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/tag/betsy-mccaughey/ |title=Betsy McCaughey |publisher=Factcheck.org |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101230326/http://www.factcheck.org/tag/betsy-mccaughey/ |archivedate=November 1, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 25, 2013 appearance on Fox News, McCaughey said that the Affordable Care Act would have the effect of "eviscerating Medicare."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KI1pfbi1wc |title=Betsy McCaughey: Obamacare designed to vastly expand single payer Medicaid by eviscerating Medicare |publisher=YouTube |date=October 25, 2013 |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brambles Farm Peace Camp''' was a [[peace camp]] set up in the Spring of 1982 on farmland at [[Waterlooville|Waterlooville, Hampshire]] by local residents and peace campaigners to protest at and to disrupt the planned construction of a torpedo factory on the site.  The demonstrators occupied the land for some 12 weeks before being evicted in September of that year.  The site was soon re-occupied for a short time although this was short-lived and the peace camp folded soon after.  The Torpedo Town Festival was born out of the camp and was held at various locations, wandering from Hampshire to as far away as Wales, until the early nineties.

On October 23, 2005, [[Brazil]] held a country-wide '''[[referendum]] on article 35 of the Disarmament Statute''' to determine whether to approve or disapprove the article, which states in full, "The sale of [[firearms]] and [[ammunition]] is prohibited in the entire national territory, except to those entities provided in article 6 of this Law." ("Art. 35. É proibida a comercialização de arma de fogo e munição em todo o território nacional, salvo para as entidades previstas no art. 6&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; desta Lei."&lt;ref name="L10826"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/2003/L10.826.htm|title=LEI N&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 10.826, DE 22 DE DEZEMBRO DE 2003.|accessdate=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The referendum failed by nearly ⅔ and that part of the statute was not enacted.

The referendum and its date had been provided by the Disarmament Statute itself (art. 35, §1&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="L10826"/&gt; During the drafting and development of the law, it had been decided that article 35 should be submitted to a referendum because of the importance of its subject. On July 7, 2005, the [[Federal Senate of Brazil]] promulgated legislative decree 780, which authorized the referendum. Article 2 of its decree stipulated that the public consultation should employ the following question: "Should commerce in firearms and ammunition be prohibited in Brazil?" ("O comércio de armas de fogo e munição deve ser proibido no Brasil?"&lt;ref name="DL780"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.camara.gov.br/legin/fed/decleg/2005/decretolegislativo-780-7-julho-2005-537738-publicacaooriginal-30531-pl.html|title=Decreto Legislativo n&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 780, de 2005|accessdate=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Background==
Voting was compulsory for people between the ages of 18 and 70. The belief of a fundamental natural human right to self-defense, low efficacy of [[Policing in Brazil|police]], high levels of use of illegal weapons in crimes in contrast to a very rare usage of legal weapons, are some of the factors that may have influenced 65% of Brazilian people to vote against the ban proposal. The gun ban proposal received broad support in the press, while celebrities were generally in favor of it, only Brazil's anti-ban social groups and right-wing press, most importantly [[Veja (magazine)|Veja]] the Brazilian [[news magazine]] (indeed weekly publication of any kind) with the largest paid circulation in the country. Other media, like the powerful Globo group (owners of Brazil's largest TV network [[Rede Globo]]) and newspapers of record like [[Folha de S.Paulo]] advocated clearly pro gun ban. The Federal Government was a self-declared pro gun ban power [http://www.institutolula.org/lula-defende-o-estatuto-do-desarmamento].

According to the Brazilian constitution, every citizen has the right to self-defense and the pro-gun campaigners focused their arguments on this constitutional right, as well as making economic arguments.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

A decisive argument made by the pro-gun campaigners was to question the morality of the government removing a right from its citizens, resulting in a strong feeling among voters that no rights should ever be allowed to be taken away by the government.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u114537.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there were debates about the significant cultural status of gun ownership in the southern states of the country.

Another major argument used by the pro-gun ownership campaigners was the fact that the absolute majority of the gun crimes in Brazil were committed with unregistered and illegal guns, specially high caliber guns, that were already forbidden in Brazil and due to that, it would be of no use to forbid law-abiding citizens to own legal registered guns in accordance to the law. This argument was strongly reinforced by the fact that the regions where gun ownership is widespread were the ones with the smallest number of gun-related deaths. In the South region where there is the highest number of legal guns per citizen only 59% of all murders were caused by firearms in contrast to 70% in the Northeast where there is the lowest number of legal firearms per citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Urbim, Emiliano (2008). "Mapa da morte", Superinteressante, Nº 262, Pp 30 and 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-gun proponents argued that guns are dangerous for society and that their only reason to exist is to harm others.

The anti-gun campaign received widespread support from several famous actors, musicians and other Brazilian celebrities and a noticeable support from the nation's main TV station, [[Rede Globo]].

The ban had the backing of the federal government and sections of the Brazilian Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=morton-gunning /&gt; The anti-gun lobby received vast support and free coverage from the press, including [[Rede Globo]], Brazil's largest TV network despite its parent company fairly neutral stance which eventually was reflected. By that time most Protestant-evangelical news organizations had taken a clearly anti-ban stance (including the [[Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus]]-owned [[Rede Record]], Globo's main competitor at the time.

IANSA urged support of the ban to "reinforce the movement in favor of gun control in other Latin American countries riddled with armed violence, and back the efforts to control private gun ownership at [an] international level."&lt;ref name=morton-gunning&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5982">"'''Canada's New Government'''" was a [[brand]]ing term or political [[slogan]] used by the [[Government of Canada]] during the first twenty months of the [[28th Canadian Ministry]] under [[Stephen Harper]]. Previously, federal government announcements simply referred to the "Government of Canada".

Harper, leader of the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]], took office as [[Prime Minister of Canada]] on February 6, 2006. Immediately thereafter, the federal government began to use the term as part of a marketing campaign to differentiate the Harper government from the previous [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] government, led by [[Paul Martin]].

For the first few months after Harper's party assumed office, it is believed that this term was used only in very high level communication and press releases from the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Canada)|Prime Minister's Office]] and the offices of [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]] ministers. It was also applied to some government communication through the www.gc.ca web portal. Beginning in the summer of 2006, wider use of the term was encouraged by the Harper government in Canada's public service, however policies for its use were unclear.

The phrase was quietly dropped in October 2007, with most references reverting to the "Government of Canada".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/10/16/new-government.html 'New' government becomes old news for Tories], [[Canadian Press]], October 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Okulitch incident==
Issues regarding usage of the phrase within the public service culminated in a situation where Andrew Okulitch, a retired research scientist and at that time a scientist emeritus with the [[Geological Survey of Canada]], refused to comply with a communications directive from [[Natural Resources Canada]] that specified employees use the term.

It read as follows:

:''"As per the Minister's Office, effective immediately, the words "Canada's New Government" are to be used instead of "the Government of Canada" in all departmental correspondence. Please note that the initial letters of all three words are capitalized. Thank you for your cooperation."'' (September 5, 2006, Vanessa Nelson, Executive Advisor, Communications Branch, Natural Resources Canada) [https://web.archive.org/web/20070216134634/http://www.rickmercer.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/1/18/Harper-in-Harpers])

This was followed with a reply from Okulitch to all recipients of the email:

:''"Why do newly elected officials think everything begins with them taking office? They are merely stewards for as long as the public allows. They are the Government of Canada. Nothing more. I shall use "Geological Survey of Canada" on my departmental correspondence to avoid any connection with "New Government." The GSC, steward to Canada's earth resources for 164 years, is an institution worthy of my loyalty, as opposed to idiotic buzzwords coined by political hacks."'' (Andrew Okulitch, Scientist Emeritus, Geological Survey of Canada, Earth Sciences Sector, Natural Resources Canada [https://web.archive.org/web/20070216134634/http://www.rickmercer.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/1/18/Harper-in-Harpers])

Okulitch received this reply to his email within an hour from Irwin Itzkovitch, then Assistant Deputy Minister, Earth Sciences Sector:

:''"Given your strong though misdirected views of the role and authority of the Government as elected by the people, and your duty to reflect their decisions, I accept that you are immediately removing yourself from the Emeritus Program. I wish you every success in your future."'' (Irwin Itzkovitch, Special Advisor, Deputy Minister's Office, Natural Resources Canada [https://web.archive.org/web/20070216134634/http://www.rickmercer.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/1/18/Harper-in-Harpers])

A media frenzy ensued, deriding the federal government's treatment of the affair and Okulitch was reinstated by Deputy Minister of Natural Resources, Cassie Doyle [http://direct.srv.gc.ca/cgi-bin/direct500/REcn%3dDoyle%5c%2c%20Cassie%2cou%3dDMO-CSM%2cou%3dNRCAN-RNCAN%2co%3dGC%2cc%3dCA] who informed Okulitch that he would not have to use the phrase as it was not intended for "working-level people and never was." [http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/09/19/scientist-flap.html]  This was confirmed by [[Minister of Natural Resources (Canada)|Minister of Natural Resources]], [[Gary Lunn]], who said there was no expectation for anyone in the department to use the slogan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2108">'''Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage''' was a committee formed in 1872 in London to lobby parliament. It was initially led by activists from Manchester.

== History ==
[[Jacob Bright]] suggested in 1871 that it would be useful to create a London-based organisation to lobby members of parliament concerning women's suffrage. The Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage first met on 17 January 1872. The first committee included [[Frances Power Cobbe]], [[Priscilla Bright McLaren]], [[Lilias Ashworth Hallett]] and [[Agnes Garrett]]. The committee introduced a subscription fee of a shilling per annum.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/Wcentral.htm|title=Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage|work=Spartacus Educational|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Millicent Fawcett]] joined the committee in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/electionsvoting/womenvote/case-studies-women-parliament/millicent-garrett-fawcett/the-early-suffrage-societies-in-the-19th-century---a-timeline/|title=The Early Suffrage Societies in the 19th century - a timeline|website=UK Parliament|language=en|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lydia Becker]] became the chair of the committee in 1881. Other committee members then included [[Helen Blackburn]], Millicent Fawcett, [[Jessie Boucherett]], [[Eva McLaren]], [[Margaret Bright Lucas]] as well as Priscilla Bright McLaren and Frances Power Cobbe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
CPPR was conceived as a policy [[wikipedia:Think_tank|think tank]] by a group of young individuals, who believed in [[Freedom of speech|Freedom of Expression]], [[Rule of law|Rule of Law]] and Right to Livelihood. The centre aims to support the creation of an equitable, socially just and environmentally sound society enriched by the principles of democracy and secularism.

In 2009, the [[Ministry of Science and Technology, India]] authorised the CPPR team and Civitas Legal Solutions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.civitas.in/|title=CIVITAS  - Legal Solutions, Urban Solutions, Advisory Solutions|website=www.civitas.in|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;to assist the [[Government of India]] (GOI) in preparing the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.civitas.in/news_and_events/14/National_Data_Sharing_Policy_approved_by_the_Cabinet|title=National Data Sharing Policy approved by the Cabinet - Civitas|website=www.civitas.in|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Cabinet of India]] cleared the draft policy on February 15, 2012.

It strives to develop market models for building sustainable systems and processes to meet the growing demands of urban spaces. It was in the forefront of initiating ‘Bus Day&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bus-day-observed-in-kochi/article2067332.ece|title=Bus Day observed in Kochi|last=Reporter|first=Staff|date=2011-06-01|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-09-29|last2=Reporter|first2=Staff|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bus-day-to-be-revived-in-kochi/article2039651.ece|title=|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;’ in Kochi, a campaign aimed at branding buses as the best way to move about a city. The campaign encouraged people to leave their private vehicles at home and hop on to city buses, to understand the importance of the public transport system in reducing traffic and environmental issues.

===CPPR Centre for Comparative Studies===
Dr Chandra Ranade&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/States-that-do-well-should-be-supported-Chandra-Ranade/articleshow/22416426.cms|title=States that do well should be supported: Chandra Ranade - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Adjunct Faculty of Virginia International University, launched the CPPR Centre for Comparative Studies in Kochi on September 6, 2013. 

The centre attempts to study the socio-economic and political factors influencing the development of states in India. It analyses the evolution of democratic processes, voting patterns and new actors of conflict in the states of India. The centre also looks into Centre–state relationship, state–state relationship and city–city relationship in the post-globalised world.

===CPPR Centre for Strategic Studies===
CPPR Centre for Strategic Studies was launched in Kochi on August 16, 2013 . The event was marked by a lecture on ‘Prospects of ASEAN in India’s Look East Policy’ delivered by Dr. Ernest Bower, Senior Adviser and Sumitro Chair for Southeast Asia Studies, Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies (CSIS), Washington D.C. It was held in association with the Office of Public Affairs, U.S. Consulate General, Chennai.

The centre initiates research in the areas of energy security, maritime security, terrorism, inter-state and inter-country cooperation and extremism. It seeks to develop database and expertise on security in India at the regional level. It also aims to develop a vision plan for Centre-State relationship in national security. This will aid the Indian Government and its security agencies in developing a framework to strengthen security and coordination at the state level.

=== CPPR Academy ===
CPPR Academy aims to promote research and scientific thinking and strives to spread knowledge about public policy research. The academy purports to seek partnerships with like-minded academia and institutions across the world.
;Semester at Sea&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Semester at Sea students learn about Kerala|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/semester-at-sea-students-learn-about-kerala/article2993123.ece|newspaper=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Around 80 students and staff of Semester at Sea (SAS), a 105-day academic voyage around the world on a floating campus, MV Explorer, anchored in Kochi for the first time in 2010. The participants visited the CPPR office in Kochi to attend a presentation on ‘Social Justice, Sustainable Development and Democracy in India’. SAS is a unique course designed for students from various streams and nationalities with sessions inside a ship. The University of Virginia is the academic sponsor of the programme.

SAS has now become a regular affair with Kochi and India on its map, due to the efforts of CPPR. The centre has hosted SAS six times since 2010, with the latest being a thematic session on 'Global Trade from India's Perspective' in March 2016.

;Finishing School for Law Students

CPPR conducts a three-day residential certificate course for law graduates called the Finishing School for Law Students (FSL). The course offers the participants unique insights into legal practice. It is organised by the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Centre, the dispute resolution wing of CPPR. Launched in 2008, the ADR Centre provides cutting-edge services to assist the growth of ADR in India.

;Summer/Winter School on Public Policy Research Methods
The concept of Winter School was initiated in 2012, when the Atlas Economic Research Foundation or Atlas Network and CPPR came together to launch a pilot venture to impart necessary training in research techniques to public policy researchers across the globe. Surprisingly, it was found that many institutions working in the arena of public policy, advocacy and policy analysis were doing research with less or no understanding of research techniques. The Atlas Network wanted CPPR to train research institutions and individual researchers, who can utilise the skills for their activities in their home countries. The primary aim was to facilitate research that stood out for its originality of thought and approach. Over the years, both Summer Schools and Winter Schools have attracted participants from Europe, Africa, Australia, America and Asia.

;Internship

CPPR offers internship opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students looking to engage with the public policy space. It has hosted more than 100 interns from different educational and cultural backgrounds, who have become its campus ambassadors in India and abroad. 

== CPPR Quarterly Lecture Series ==
The CPPR Quarterly Lecture Series is one of the prestigious events organised by CPPR, which has helped cement its position as one of the leading policy think tanks in India.

KOD has its Polish headquarters in Warsaw and international office in Brussels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kod.ngo/kod-who-is-who/international/|title=Who is Who - International|website=Committee for the Defence of Democracy|language=en-EN|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; (KOD International), with chapters and affiliated associations around Europe, in North America, Asia and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kod.ngo/kod-who-is-who/diaspora/|title=Who is Who - Diaspora|website=Committee for the Defence of Democracy|language=en-EN|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was awarded the 2016 [[European Citizens' Prize]] by the [[European Parliament]] for defending fundamental rights and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://neweuropeans.net/article/1482/kod-wins-european-citizens-prize-2016|title=KOD wins the European Citizens' Prize 2016|website=New Europeans|language=en-EN|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{details|Polish constitutional crisis, 2015}}
KOD was formed after Law and Justice won parliament election. In opposition to several actions taken by the governing party, [[Law and Justice]] ({{lang-pl|Prawo i Sprawiedliwość}}, PiS),&lt;ref name="wyborcza" /&gt; which in October 2015 became the first party in post-communist Polish history to control an [[absolute majority]] of the seats in the [[Polish Parliament]], with a PiS-backed candidate, [[Andrzej Duda]], winning the presidential elections just a few months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-election-idUSKCN0SL1XH20151027|title=Poland's Eurosceptics win outright majority in parliament|date=2015-10-27|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary impetus for the formation of KOD was the Parliament’s enactment of a law on 26 November 2015 purporting to invalidate the prior Government’s appointment of five judges to the [[Polish Constitutional Court]] and the nomination of new PiS-affiliated judges to replace them.&lt;ref name=polskanewsweek/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/12/16/pola-d16.html|title=Tens of thousands march in Warsaw against constitutional coup - World Socialist Web Site|last=Niemitz|first=Dorota|website=www.wsws.org|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the organisation has opposed and reacted to any actions taken by the government or President Andrzej Duda which were deemed unlawful, undermining democracy, limiting civil liberties or going against European principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/25/poland-right-law-justice-party-europe|title=Xenophobic, authoritarian – and generous on welfare: how Poland’s right rules|website=The Economist|language=en-EN|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activity==
 
On November 26, 2015, the members of KOD wrote an open letter entitled “A Letter of the Citizens of the Constitutional State to [[Andrzej Duda]], the [[President of Poland]]” asking him to swear in three of the five judges to the Constitutional Court. KOD argued that those three, although not the other two, were duly elected by the previous parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metrocafe.pl/metrocafe/1,145523,19257132,ostry-list-komitetu-obrony-demokracji-do-prezydenta.html|title=Ostry list Komitetu Obrony Demokracji do Prezydenta!|website=metrocafe.pl|language=pl-PL|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the disagreements between the governing party and the Constitutional Court continued, KOD called for protests against what it perceives as a breach of the Constitution in violation of [[Democracy|democratic]] norms and the constitutional [[separation of powers]] between the legislature, executive branch, and judiciary.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

* Demonstration, which was estimated by “[[Der Spiegel]]” and “[[Le Monde]]” to include 50,000 demonstrators,&lt;ref name="lemonde" /&gt;&lt;ref name="derspiegel" /&gt; and at between 17,000 and 20,000 people by the police,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.radiozet.pl/Wiadomosci/Kraj/Poicja-Na-warszawskiej-manifestacji-KOD-17-20-tys.-osob-00015865|title=Policja: Na warszawskiej manifestacji KOD 17-20 tys. osób|author=Redakcja Radia ZET|work=Policja: Na warszawskiej manifestacji KOD 17-20 tys. osób - Wiadomości|accessdate=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; took place in front of the headquarters of the Constitutional Court in Warsaw on December 12, 2015. Parallel demonstrations were also held in other major Polish cities, including: [[Poznań]] (over 2,000 people), [[Szczecin]] (over 2,000 people), [[Wrocław]] (approx. 2,000 people), [[Lublin]] (500), and [[Bielsko-Biała]] (200).
* On December 13, 2015, over 3,000 people demonstrated in [[Gdańsk]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}. 
* On January 9, 2016, there were demonstrations on the "Free Media" in 20 cities in Poland.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} 
* On January 23, 2016, 40 cities and towns in Poland saw protests about "Defense of Your freedom".{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} 
* A demonstration with 70,000 people was held in Warsaw on 27 February; it was called "We, the People".{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}
* A demonstration under the theme "We are and will remain in Europe" took place on May 7 in Warsaw and was estimated to gather up to 240,000 people by City Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2016/05/07/464427/Poland-Warsaw|title=Some 240k demonstrate against Polish government policies in Warsaw|website=Press TV|language=en-EN|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the protests in Poland are accompanied by smaller protests by KOD cells in most European capitals and around the world, notably in Brussels, London, Paris, Berlin and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://londynek.net/wiadomosci/article?jdnews_id=34194|title=Polonia manifestowała na całym świecie.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30209">'''Data remanence''' is the residual representation of [[digital data]] that remains even after attempts have been made to remove or erase the data.  This residue may result from data being left intact by a nominal [[file deletion]] operation, by reformatting of storage media that does not remove data previously written to the media, or through physical properties of the [[data storage device|storage media]] that allow previously written data to be recovered.  Data remanence may make inadvertent disclosure of [[information sensitivity|sensitive information]] possible should the storage media be released into an uncontrolled environment (''e.g.'', thrown in the trash or lost). &lt;!-- the significance of the concept depends on the existence of a third party --&gt;

Various techniques have been developed to counter data remanence.  These techniques are classified as [[#Clearing|clearing]],  [[#Purging|purging/sanitizing]], or [[#Destruction|destruction]].  Specific methods include [[#Overwriting|overwriting]], [[#Degaussing|degaussing]], [[#Encryption|encryption]], and [[#Media destruction|media destruction]].

Effective application of countermeasures can be complicated by several factors, including media that are inaccessible, media that cannot effectively be erased, advanced storage systems that maintain histories of data throughout the data's life cycle, and persistence of data in memory that is typically considered volatile.

Several [[#Standards|standards]] exist for the secure removal of data and the elimination of data remanence.

==Causes==

Many [[operating system]]s, [[file manager]]s, and other software provide a facility where a [[computer file|file]] is not immediately [[File deletion|deleted]] when the user requests that action.  Instead, the file is moved to a [[Recycle bin (computing)|holding area]], making it easy for  the user to undo a mistake. Similarly, many software products automatically create backup copies of files that are being edited, to allow the user to restore the original version, or to recover from a possible crash (''[[autosave]]'' feature).

Even when an explicit deleted file retention facility is not provided or when the user does not use it, operating systems do not actually remove the contents of a file when it is deleted unless they are aware that explicit erasure commands are required, like on a [[solid-state drive]]. (In such cases, the operating system will issue the [[Serial ATA]] [[TRIM]] command or the [[SCSI]] UNMAP command to let the drive know to no longer maintain the deleted data.) Instead, they simply remove the file's entry from the [[file system]] [[directory (file systems)|directory]], because this requires less work and is therefore faster, and the contents of the file—the actual data—remain on the [[data storage device|storage medium]]. The data will remain there until the [[operating system]] reuses the space for new data. In some systems, enough filesystem [[metadata]] are also left behind to enable easy [[undeletion]] by commonly available [[utility software]]. Even when undelete has become impossible, the data, until it has been overwritten, can be read by software that reads [[disk sector]]s directly. [[Computer forensics]] often employs such software.

Likewise, [[Disk formatting|reformatting]], [[Disk partitioning|repartitioning]], or [[Disk image|reimaging]] a system is unlikely to write to every area of the disk, though all will cause the disk to appear empty or, in the case of reimaging, empty except for the files present in the image, to most software.

Finally, even when the storage media is overwritten, physical properties of the media may permit recovery of the previous contents. In most cases however, this recovery is not possible by just reading from the storage device in the usual way, but requires using laboratory techniques such as disassembling the device and directly accessing/reading from its components.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The [[#Complications|section on complications]] gives further explanations for causes of data remanence.

==Countermeasures==
{{Main|Data erasure}}

There are three levels commonly recognized for eliminating remnant data:

===Clearing===

'''Clearing''' is the removal of sensitive data from storage devices in such a way that there is assurance that the data may not be reconstructed using normal system functions or software file/data recovery utilities.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}  The data may still be recoverable, but not without special laboratory techniques.&lt;ref name="SP800-88"&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-88-rev1/sp800_88_r1_draft.pdf
 | title=Special Publication 800-88: Guidelines for Media Sanitization Rev. 1
 | publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]
 |date=6 September 2012|format=PDF|accessdate=2014-06-23
}} (542 KB)&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearing is typically an administrative protection against accidental disclosure within an organization.  For example, before a [[hard drive]] is re-used within an organization, its contents may be cleared to prevent their accidental disclosure to the next user.

===Purging===

'''Purging''' or '''[[Sanitization (classified information)|sanitizing]]''' is the removal of sensitive data from a system or storage device with the intent that the data cannot be reconstructed by any known technique.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}  Purging, proportional to the sensitivity of the data, is generally done before releasing media beyond control, such as before discarding old media, or moving media to a computer with different security requirements.

===Destruction===
The storage media is made unusable for conventional equipment.  Effectiveness of destroying the media varies by medium and method.  Depending on recording density of the media, and/or the destruction technique, this may leave data recoverable by laboratory methods.  Conversely, destruction using appropriate techniques is the most secure method of preventing retrieval.

==Specific methods==

===Overwriting===

A common method used to counter data remanence is to overwrite the storage media with new data.  This is often called '''wiping''' or '''shredding''' a file or disk, by analogy to common methods of [[paper shredding|destroying print media]], although the mechanism bears no similarity to these.  Because such a method can often be implemented in [[software]] alone, and may be able to selectively target only part of the media, it is a popular, low-cost option for some applications. Overwriting is generally an acceptable method of clearing, as long as the media is writable and not damaged.

The simplest overwrite technique writes the same data everywhere—often just a pattern of all zeros.  At a minimum, this will prevent the data from being retrieved simply by reading from the media again using standard system functions.

In an attempt to counter more advanced data recovery techniques, specific overwrite patterns and multiple passes have often been prescribed. These may be generic patterns intended to eradicate any trace signatures, for example, the seven-pass pattern: 0xF6, 0x00, 0xFF, random, 0x00, 0xFF, random; sometimes erroneously{{clarify|date=May 2014}} attributed to the US standard [[DOD 5220.22-M]].

One challenge with an overwrite is that some areas of the disk may be [[#Inaccessible media areas|inaccessible]], due to media degradation or other errors.  Software overwrite may also be problematic in high-security environments which require stronger controls on data commingling than can be provided by the software in use.  The use of [[#Advanced storage systems|advanced storage technologies]] may also make file-based overwrite ineffective (see the discussion below under [[#Complications|''Complications'']]).

There are specialized machines and software that are capable of doing overwriting. The software can sometimes be a standalone operating system specifically designed for data destruction. There are also machines specifically designed to wipe hard drives to the department of defense specifications DOD 5220.22-M.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

====Feasibility of recovering overwritten data====

[[Peter Gutmann (computer scientist)|Peter Gutmann]] investigated data recovery from nominally overwritten media in the mid-1990s.  He suggested [[magnetic force microscopy]] may be able to recover such data, and developed specific patterns, for specific drive technologies, designed to counter such.&lt;ref name="Gutmann"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory|author=Peter Gutmann|date=July 1996|url=http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html|accessdate=2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These patterns have come to be known as the [[Gutmann method]].

Daniel Feenberg, an economist at the private [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], claims that the chances of overwritten data being recovered from a modern hard drive amount to "urban legend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Can Intelligence Agencies Recover Overwritten Data?|author=Daniel Feenberg|url=http://www.nber.org/sys-admin/overwritten-data-gutmann.html|accessdate=2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also points to the "[[18½ minute gap|{{frac|18|1|2}}-minute gap]]" [[Rose Mary Woods]] created on a tape of [[Richard Nixon]] discussing the [[Watergate break-in]]. Erased information in the gap has not been recovered, and Feenberg claims doing so would be an easy task compared to recovery of a modern high density digital signal.

As of November 2007, the [[United States Department of Defense]] considers overwriting acceptable for clearing magnetic media within the same security area/zone, but not as a sanitization method.  Only [[#Degaussing|degaussing]] or [[#Physical destruction|physical destruction]] is acceptable for the latter.&lt;ref name=DSSmatrix&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregon.gov/DAS/OP/docs/policy/state/107-009-005_Exhibit_B.pdf?ga=t| title=DSS Clearing &amp; Sanitization Matrix|publisher=[[Defense Security Service|DSS]]| format=PDF|date=2007-06-28|accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, according to the 2014 [[NIST]] Special Publication 800-88 Rev. 1 (p.&amp;nbsp;7): "For storage devices containing ''magnetic'' media, a single overwrite pass with a fixed pattern such as binary zeros typically hinders recovery of data even if state of the art laboratory techniques are applied to attempt to retrieve the data."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | date = December 2014 | accessdate = 2018-06-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis by Wright et al. of recovery techniques, including magnetic force microscopy, also concludes that a single wipe is all that is required for modern drives. They point out that the long time required for multiple wipes "has created a situation
where many organisations ignore the issue all together – resulting in data leaks and
loss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degaussing===

[[Bulk eraser|Degaussing]] is the removal or reduction of a magnetic field of a disk or drive, using a device called a degausser that has been designed for the media being erased.  Applied to [[magnetic storage|magnetic media]], degaussing may purge an entire media element quickly and effectively.

Degaussing often renders [[hard disk]]s inoperable, as it erases low-level [[disk format|formatting]] that is only done at the factory during manufacturing.  In some cases, it is possible to return the drive to a functional state by having it serviced at the manufacturer. However, some modern degaussers use such a strong magnetic pulse that the motor that spins the platters may be destroyed in the degaussing process, and servicing may not be cost-effective. Degaussed computer tape such as [[Digital Linear Tape|DLT]] can generally be reformatted and reused with standard consumer hardware.

In some high-security environments, one may be required to use a degausser that has been approved for the task.  For example, in [[United States|US]] government and military jurisdictions, one may be required to use a degausser from the [[National Security Agency|NSA]]'s "Evaluated Products List".&lt;ref name="NSAEPL"&gt;{{cite web
 | title=Media Destruction Guidance
 | publisher=NSA
 | url=http://www.nsa.gov/ia/mitigation_guidance/media_destruction_guidance/|accessdate=2009-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encryption===

[[Encryption|Encrypting]] data before it is stored on the media may mitigate concerns about data remanence.  If the [[Key (cryptography)|decryption key]] is strong and carefully controlled, it may effectively make any data on the media unrecoverable.  Even if the key is stored on the media, it may prove easier or quicker to [[#Overwriting|overwrite]] just the key, vs the entire disk. This process is called [[crypto-shredding]].

Encryption may be done on a [[Filesystem-level encryption|file-by-file]] basis, or on the [[Disk encryption|whole disk]]. [[Cold boot attack]]s are one of the few possible methods for subverting a [[Disk encryption|full-disk encryption]] method, as there is no possibility of storing the plain text key in an unencrypted section of the medium. See the section [[#Complications|Complications: Data in RAM]] for further discussion.

Other [[side-channel attack]]s (such as [[keyloggers]], acquisition of a written note containing the decryption key, or [[rubber-hose cryptanalysis]]) may offer a greater chance to success, but do not rely on weaknesses in the cryptographic method employed. As such, their relevance for this article is minor.

===Media destruction===

[[File:Destroyed Hard Drive.jpg|thumb|250px|The pieces of a physically destroyed hard disk drive.]]

Thorough destruction of the underlying storage media is the most certain way to counter data remanence.  However, the process is generally time-consuming, cumbersome, and may require extremely thorough methods, as even a small fragment of the media may contain large amounts of data.

Specific destruction techniques include:

* [[Physical change|Physically breaking]] the media apart (e.g., by grinding or shredding)
* [[Chemical change|Chemically altering]] the media into a non-readable, non-reverse-constructible state (e.g., through [[incineration]] or exposure to [[causticity|caustic]]/[[corrosive]] chemicals)

==Complications==

===Inaccessible media areas===

Storage media may have areas which become inaccessible by normal means.  For example, [[Magnetic storage|magnetic disks]] may develop new [[bad sector]]s after data has been written, and tapes require inter-record gaps. Modern [[hard disk]]s often feature reallocation of marginal sectors or tracks, automated in a way that the [[operating system]] would not need to work with it. The problem is especially significant in [[Solid-state drive|solid state drives]] (SSDs) that rely on relatively large relocated bad block tables. Attempts to counter data remanence by [[#Overwriting|overwriting]] may not be successful in such situations, as data remnants may persist in such nominally inaccessible areas.

=== Advanced storage systems ===
Data storage systems with more sophisticated features may make [[#Overwriting|overwrite]] ineffective, especially on a per-file basis.  
For example, [[journaling file system]]s increase the integrity of data by recording write operations in multiple locations, and applying [[Transaction processing|transaction]]-like semantics; on such systems, data remnants may exist in locations "outside" the nominal file storage location.  Some file systems also implement [[copy-on-write]] or built-in [[revision control]], with the intent that writing to a file never overwrites data in-place.  Furthermore, technologies such as [[RAID]] and [[File system fragmentation|anti-fragmentation]] techniques may result in file data being written to multiple locations, either by design (for [[Fault-tolerant design|fault tolerance]]), or as data remnants.

[[Wear leveling]] can also defeat data erasure, by relocating blocks between the time when they are originally written and the time when they are overwritten.  For this reason, some security protocols tailored to operating systems or other software featuring automatic wear leveling recommend conducting a free-space wipe of a given drive and then copying many small, easily identifiable "junk" files or files containing other nonsensitive data to fill as much of that drive as possible, leaving only the amount of free space necessary for satisfactory operation of system hardware and software.  As storage and/or system demands grow, the "junk data" files can be deleted as necessary to free up space; even if the deletion of "junk data" files is not secure, their initial nonsensitivity reduces to near zero the consequences of recovery of data remanent from them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Optical media===

As [[Optical disc|optical media]] are not magnetic, they are not erased by conventional [[#Degaussing|degaussing]]. [[Write Once Read Many|Write-once]] optical media ([[CD-R]], [[DVD-R]], etc.) also cannot be purged by overwriting.  Rewritable optical media, such as [[CD-RW]] and [[DVD-RW]], may be receptive to [[#Overwriting|overwriting]]. Methods for successfully sanitizing optical discs include delaminating or abrading the metallic data layer, shredding, incinerating, destructive electrical arcing (as by exposure to microwave energy), and submersion in a polycarbonate solvent (e.g., acetone).

===Data on solid-state drives===

Research from the Center for Magnetic Recording and Research, University of California, San Diego has uncovered problems inherent in erasing data stored on [[solid-state drive]]s (SSDs). Researchers discovered three problems with file storage on SSDs:&lt;ref name="SSD"&gt;{{cite journal|date=February 2011|title=Reliably Erasing Data From Flash-Based Solid State Drives|url=http://www.usenix.org/events/fast11/tech/full_papers/Wei.pdf|author1=Michael Wei|author2=Laura M. Grupp|author3=Frederick E. Spada|author4=Steven Swanson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|First, built-in commands are effective, but manufacturers sometimes implement them incorrectly. Second, overwriting the entire visible address space of an SSD twice is usually, but not always, sufficient to sanitize the drive. Third, none of the existing hard drive-oriented techniques for individual file sanitization are effective on SSDs.&lt;ref name="SSD"/&gt;{{rp|page=1}} |}}

Solid-state drives, which are flash-based, differ from hard-disk drives in two ways: first, in the way data is stored; and second, in the way the algorithms are used to manage and access that data. These differences can be exploited to recover previously erased data. SSDs maintain a layer of indirection between the logical addresses used by computer systems to access data and the internal addresses that identify physical storage. This layer of indirection hides idiosyncratic media interfaces and enhances SSD performance, reliability, and lifespan (see [[wear leveling]]); but it can also produce copies of the data that are invisible to the user and that a sophisticated attacker could recover. For sanitizing entire disks, sanitize commands built into the SSD hardware have been found to be effective when implemented correctly, and software-only techniques for sanitizing entire disks have been found to work most, but not all, of the time.&lt;ref name="SSD"/&gt;{{rp|section 5}} In testing, none of the  software techniques were effective for sanitizing individual files. These included well-known algorithms such as the [[Gutmann method]], [[National Industrial Security Program|US DoD 5220.22-M]], RCMP TSSIT OPS-II, Schneier 7 Pass, and Mac OS X Secure Erase Trash.&lt;ref name="SSD"/&gt;{{rp|section 5}}

The [[Trim (computing)|TRIM]] feature in many SSD devices, if properly implemented, will eventually erase data after it is deleted{{citation needed|reason=This doesn't appear to be a secure method for deletion/sanitization|date=April 2017}}, but the process can take some time, typically several minutes. Many older operating systems do not support this feature, and not all combinations of drives and operating systems work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forensic.belkasoft.com/en/why-ssd-destroy-court-evidence |title=Digital Evidence Extraction Software for Computer Forensic Investigations |publisher=Forensic.belkasoft.com |date=October 2012 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{Anchor|RAM}}Data in RAM ===
Data remanence has been observed in [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM), which is typically considered volatile (''i.e.'', the contents degrade with loss of external power).  In one study, [[data retention]] was observed even at room temperature.&lt;ref name="skorobogatov"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Low temperature data remanence in static RAM|author=Sergei Skorobogatov|publisher=University of Cambridge, Computer Laboratory|date=June 2002|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-536.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data remanence has also been observed in [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM). Modern DRAM chips have a built-in self-refresh module, as they not only require a power supply to retain data, but must also be periodically refreshed to prevent their data contents from fading away from the capacitors in their integrated circuits. A study found data remanence in DRAM with data retention of seconds to minutes at room temperature and "a full week without refresh when cooled with liquid nitrogen."&lt;ref name="Halderman" /&gt; The study authors were able to use a [[cold boot attack]] to recover cryptographic [[key (cryptography)|keys]] for several popular [[full disk encryption]] systems, including Microsoft [[BitLocker Drive Encryption|BitLocker]], Apple [[FileVault]], [[dm-crypt]] for Linux, and [[TrueCrypt]].&lt;ref name="Halderman" /&gt;{{rp|page=12}}

Despite some memory degradation, authors of the above described study were able to take advantage of redundancy in the way keys are stored after they have been expanded for efficient use, such as in [[key scheduling]]. The authors recommend that computers be powered down, rather than be left in a "[[power management|sleep]]" state, when not in physical control of the owner. In some cases, such as certain modes of the software program BitLocker, the authors recommend that a boot password or a key on a removable USB device be used.&lt;ref name="Halderman"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lest We Remember: Cold Boot Attacks on Encryption Keys|author=[[J. Alex Halderman]] |date=July 2008|url=https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec08/tech/full_papers/halderman/halderman.pdf|format=PDF|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=12}} [[TRESOR]] is a [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] [[patch (software)|patch]] for Linux specifically intended to prevent [[cold boot attack]]s on RAM by ensuring encryption keys are neither user accessible nor stored in RAM.

The '''Democratic Union for Integration''' ({{lang-al|Bashkimi Demokratik për Integrim}}, ''BDI''; {{lang-mk|Демократска унија за интеграција}}, ''ДУИ'' — ''Demokratska unija za integracija'', ''DUI'') is the largest Albanian political party in the [[Republic of Macedonia]], and the third largest [[List of political parties in the Republic of Macedonia|political party]] in all of Macedonia. It was formed immediately after the country's [[2001 Macedonia conflict|2001 conflict]] between the [[National Liberation Army (Macedonia)|National Liberation Army]] (NLA) and the Macedonian Security Forces. The NLA leader [[Ali Ahmeti]] became party president.

At the legislative [[elections in Macedonia|elections]] on 15 September 2002, the party won 11.9% of the popular vote (70%{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} of the Albanian vote) and 16 of 120 seats.

From 2002 to 2006 it was part of the ruling coalition along with the [[Social Democratic Union of Macedonia]] (SDSM) and the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Macedonia)|Liberal Democratic Party]].

In the [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 2006|2006 legislative election]], the party formed coalition with [[Party for Democratic Prosperity]] and [[Democratic League of Bosniaks]]. This coalition received 12,2% of the vote and 18 seats. Although DUI won the largest number of seats among ethnic Albanian parties (14), since their Macedonian governmental partners lost the election, it was not invited by the new Prime Minister [[Nikola Gruevski]] to participate in the new government. Its place was taken by the second largest Albanian political party, the [[Democratic Party of Albanians|Democratic Party of the Albanians]].

However, after the [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 2008|2008 legislative early election]], the party returned to government in coalition with [[VMRO-DPMNE]].

In the [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 2011|2011 parliamentary election]], DUI received 10.2% of the total vote, winning 15 seats, a loss of the 3 seats from the previous election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=136984879 |title=Conservative Leader Claims 3rd Term In Macedonia |work=[[NPR]] |date=6 June 2011 |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

=== Skopje Fortress incident ===

After the foundations of a 13th-century church were found by a governmentally funded excavation within the [[Skopje Fortress]] complex, the Cultural Heritage Protection Office actioned a project to restore it in the form of a church museum. The DUI requested the Macedonian Government to halt construction in early 2011, which was ignored. Two weeks later, just under a hundred DUI supporters converged on the site on 11 February 2011, among them three high-ranking ethnic Albanian ministers, and some damaged part of the scaffolding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=100 DUI Activists Try to Bring Down Church at Kale Fortress |url=http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/17554/2/ |publisher=Macedonian International News Agency |date=11 February 2011 |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Fowler report, the Department of Health and Social Security separated during 1988 to form two departments, one of which was the DSS.&lt;ref name="Dept. of Social Security "&gt;{{cite web|author=Dept. of Social Security |title=Resource Accounts 2000-2001|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:mlqt7_ipH38J:www.rightsnet.org.uk/pdfs/welfarestate2002.doc+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESh7bLf8tmycUrzt2eQ3jll6Vff17zOPob_6yHShSxllh6n3iFqBHTMlVT_BJGsantqYTK_k5DxBG7kwqM7cItkhaj7IGVl38PgjNHvp8t8jwu4GpxdMsY4ljC3pY2QuacNK-n8G&amp;sig=AHIEtbQgD9kJCfc8zYlsL1vUnt3i8EbazQ&amp;pli=1|accessdate= 2012-06-06|publisher=rightsnet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2001, the department was largely replaced by the [[Department for Work and Pensions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The welfare state 1945–2002|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/inside_money/2173941.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 April 2012|date=5 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Social Security renamed|url=http://plc.practicallaw.com/5-101-5116|publisher=Practical Law Company|accessdate=26 April 2012|date=29 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the other responsibilities of the department assumed by the Treasury and the Ministry for Defence.&lt;ref name="Carmel &amp; Papadopoulos "&gt;{{cite web|author=E Carmel &amp; T Papadopoulos|title=The New governance of Social Security in Britain|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:DKEqxqNH2t8J:people.bath.ac.uk/hsstp/TP-Publications/EC-TP-New-Governance-of-Soc-Sec_2003.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShkDSp2DVGV4c92RLl3WqCnOB0axFiOhP6seva9uK60G2pnMs8_aMUnFdd5GqAxEJYYUCRfMSnG4XUPCP4Hj9ONDJCajh5wd2npqT4W3d3PlS2PCvnoFLzEiCyjzRmH-u_Wpc2C&amp;sig=AHIEtbRc022TLSrX9LOVDlmgm6M8wGCr8Q|accessdate= 2012-06-06|publisher=University of Bath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diplomatic rank''' is a system of professional and [[social rank]] used in the world of [[diplomacy]] and [[international relation]]s. A diplomat's rank determines many ceremonial details, such as the [[order of precedence]] at official processions, [[Seating plan|table seatings]] at state dinners, the person to whom [[letter of credence|diplomatic credentials]] should be presented, and the title by which the diplomat should be addressed.

== International diplomacy ==

=== Ranks ===

The current system of diplomatic ranks was established by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] (1961).&lt;ref name="vienna1961"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations|url=http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf|date=18 April 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three ranks, two of which remain in use:

#'''[[Ambassador]]'''. An Ambassador is a [[head of mission]] who is accredited to the receiving country's [[head of state]]. They head a [[diplomatic mission]] known as an [[embassy]], which is usually headquartered in a [[Chancery (diplomacy)|chancery]] in the receiving state's [[Capital city|capital]].
## A [[apostolic nuncio|papal nuncio]] is considered to have Ambassadorial rank, and he presides over a [[nunciature]].
##[[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]] send a [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioner]] who presides over a [[High commissioner|High Commission]] and has the same diplomatic rank as an Ambassador.
#'''[[Envoy (title)|Minister]]'''. A Minister was a [[head of mission]] who was accredited to the receiving country's head of state. A Minister headed a [[legation]] rather than an embassy. However, the last [[legation]]s were upgraded to [[embassy|embassies]] in the late 1960s, and the rank of Minister is now obsolete to refer to a head of mission.  Many countries use the title minister-counsellor, often shortened to minister, as reference to the deputy head of a mission .&lt;ref name="HistoryAtState"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/glossary.htm#M&lt;/ref&gt;
## An envoy or an internuncio is also considered to have the rank of Minister.
#'''[[Chargés d'affaires]]''':
## A chargé d'affaires ''en pied'' is a permanent [[head of mission]] who is accredited by his country's [[Foreign Minister]] to the receiving nation's Foreign Minister, in cases where the two governments have not reached an agreement to exchange ambassadors.
## A chargé d'affaires ''ad interim'' is a diplomat who temporarily heads a diplomatic mission in the absence of an ambassador.

The body of diplomats accredited to a country form the [[Diplomatic corps]]. Ambassadors have precedence over chargés, and precedence within each rank is determined by the date on which [[letter of credence|diplomatic credentials]] were presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diplomatic List: Order of Precedence and Date of Presentation of Credentials|url=https://www.state.gov/s/cpr/rls/dpl/29710.htm|website=Office of the Chief of Protocol, U.S. Department of State|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longest-serving ambassador is the [[Diplomatic corps#Dean of the Diplomatic Corps|Dean of the Diplomatic Corps]], who speaks for the entire diplomatic corps on matters of diplomatic privilege and protocol. In many Catholic countries, the [[Apostolic nuncio|papal nuncio]] is always considered the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps.

=== Historical ranks, 1815–1961 ===

The ranks established by the Vienna Convention (1961) modify a more elaborate system of ranks that was established by the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815):&lt;ref name="vienna1815_en"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Regulation of Vienna on the classification of diplomatic agents|encyclopedia=Yearbook of the International Law Commission|date=1957|volume=II|language=fr|url=http://legal.un.org/docs/?path=../ilc/documentation/english/reports/a_cn4_110.pdf|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''[[Ambassador]]s''', Legates, and Nuncios were personal representatives of their sovereign.
# '''[[Envoy (title)|Envoys]]''' and Ministers represented their government, and were accredited to the receiving sovereign.  
# '''[[Resident (title)|Ministers resident]]''' formed an intermediate class, between ministers and chargés. This rank was created by the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)]]&lt;ref name="vienna1818_en"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Protocol signed at Aix-la-Chapelle on 21 November 1818|encyclopedia=Yearbook of the International Law Commission|date=1957|volume=II|language=fr|url=http://legal.un.org/docs/?path=../ilc/documentation/english/reports/a_cn4_110.pdf|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
# '''[[Chargé d'affaires|Chargés d'affaires]]''' were accredited by their Foreign Minister to the receiving Foreign Minister.

The rank of ''Envoy'' was short for "Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary", and was more commonly known as ''Minister''.&lt;ref name="HistoryAtState"&gt;{{cite web|author=Office of the Historian, U.S. Department of State|website=HistoryAtState|title=Ambassadors vs. Ministers|url=http://historyatstate.tumblr.com/post/88960580988/ambassadors-vs-ministers|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ''Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States to the French Empire'' was known as the "[[United States Minister to France]]" and addressed as "Monsieur le Ministre".&lt;ref name="washburne_memoirs_1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Washburne|first1=E. B.|title=Recollections of a Minister to France, Volume I|date=1887|publisher=Scribner|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washburne_memoirs_2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Washburne|first1=E. B.|title=Recollections of a Minister to France, Volume II|date=1887|publisher=Scribner|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Ambassador was regarded as the personal representative of his sovereign as well as his government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ministers, Foreign |encyclopedia=The popular encyclopedia; or, 'Conversations Lexicon'|publisher=W. G. Blackie|location=Glasgow|quote=Those of the first class, to whom in France the title of ''ambassadeurs'' is restricted, are not merely the agents of their government, but represent their sovereign personally, and receive honours and enjoy privileges accordingly. They can be sent out only by such states as possess royal honours.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only major monarchies would exchange Ambassadors with each other, while smaller monarchies and republics only sent Ministers. Because of diplomatic reciprocity, [[Great Power]]s would only send a Minister to a smaller monarchy or a republic.&lt;ref name="allen2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Debra J.|title=Historical Dictionary of U.S. Diplomacy from the Revolution to Secession|date=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=9780810878952|page=84|quote=Basically, because of diplomatic protocol, a receiving state would not dispatch a representative with a higher rank than it has received, so when the U.S. sent ministers, it also received ministers, not ambassadors. ... The U.S. adjusted its ranking system in 1893 and began to send and receive ambassadors.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the waning years of the [[Second French Empire]], the United Kingdom sent an Ambassador to Paris, while [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Sweden-Norway]] and the United States sent Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chambers's handy guide to Paris|date=1867|publisher=W. &amp; R. Chambers|location=London and Edinburgh|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule that only monarchies could send Ambassadors was more honored in the breach than the observance. This had been true even before the Congress of Vienna, as England continued to appoint ambassadors after becoming [[Commonwealth of England|a republic]] in 1649.&lt;ref name="satow1932"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Satow|first1=Ernest Mason|title=A Guide to Diplomatic Practice|date=1932|publisher=Longmans|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries that overthrew their monarchs proved to be unwilling to accept the lower rank accorded to a republic. After the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the [[French Third Republic]] continued to send and receive ambassadors.&lt;ref name="washburne_memoirs_2"/&gt; The rule became increasingly untenable as the United States grew into a [[Great Power]]. The United States followed the French precedent in 1893 and began to exchange ambassadors with other Great Powers.&lt;ref name="HistoryAtState"/&gt;

Historically, the [[order of precedence]] had been a matter of great dispute. European powers agreed that the [[Apostolic nuncio|papal nuncio]] and [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Ambassador would have precedence, but could not agree on the relative precedence of the kingdoms and smaller countries. In 1768, the French and Russian ambassadors to Great Britain even fought a [[duel]] over who had the right to sit next to the Imperial Ambassador at a court ball. After several diplomatic incidents between their ambassadors, France and Spain agreed in 1761 to let the date of arrival determine their precedence. In 1760, Portugal attempted to apply seniority to all ambassadors, but the rule was rejected by the other European courts.&lt;ref name="satow1932"/&gt;

The Congress of Vienna finally put an end to these disputes over precedence. After an initial attempt to divide countries into three ranks faltered on the question of which country should be in each rank, the Congress instead decided to divide ''diplomats'' into three ranks. A fourth rank was added by the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)]]. Each diplomatic rank had precedence over the lower ranks, and precedence within each rank was determined by the date that their [[letter of credence|credentials]] were presented. The papal nuncio could be given a different precedence than the other ambassadors. The [[Holy Roman Empire]] had ceased to exist in 1806, so the Austrian ambassador would accumulate seniority along with the other ambassadors.&lt;ref name="satow1932"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=British and Foreign History|page=268|quote=The 17th particular act annexed to the general treaty of Vienna, containing regulations concerning the precedence of diplomatic agents, may at first sight seem of little comparative moment: but it will not be thus regarded by those who recollect how often disputes concerning precedency among ambassadors have assumed a very serious and alarming aspect, and somewhat a strong tendency to produce hostilities. The 4th article of this act is well calculated to do away all future disputes on this head.|encyclopedia=The New Annual Register, Or General Repository of History, Politics, and Literature, for the Year 1816|date=1816|publisher=William Stockdale|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bilateral diplomacy ===

[[File:Diplomatic hierarchy.png|thumb|right|250px|The distinction between managers and officers is not necessarily as apparent. Senior officers (such as first and second secretaries) often manage junior diplomats and locally hired staff.]]

In modern diplomatic practice, there are a number of diplomatic ranks below Ambassador. Since most missions are now headed by an ambassador, these ranks now rarely indicate a mission's (or its host nation's) relative importance, but rather reflect the diplomat's individual seniority within their own nation's diplomatic career path and in the diplomatic corps in the host nation:

*'''Ambassador''' (High Commissioner in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] missions to other Commonwealth countries); [[ambassador at large]]
*'''Minister-Counsellor''', often shortened as '''Minister'''
*'''Counsellor'''
*'''First Secretary'''
*'''Second Secretary'''
*'''Third Secretary'''
*'''Attaché'''
*'''Assistant Attaché'''

The term ''[[attaché]]'' is used for any diplomatic agent who does not fit in the standard diplomatic ranks, often because they are not (or were not traditionally) members of the sending country's diplomatic service or [[foreign ministry]], and were therefore only "attached" to the diplomatic mission. The most frequent use is for [[military attaché]]s, but the diplomatic title may be used for any specific individual or position as required, generally related to a specific or technical field. Since administrative and technical staff benefit from only limited [[diplomatic immunity]], some countries may routinely appoint support staff as attachés. Attaché does not, therefore, denote any rank or position (except in Soviet and post-Soviet diplomatic services, where attaché is the lowest diplomatic rank of a career diplomat). Note that many traditional functionary roles, such as [[press attaché]] or [[cultural attaché]], are not formal titles in diplomatic practice, although they may be used as a matter of custom.

===Multilateral diplomacy===
Furthermore, outside this traditional pattern of bilateral diplomacy, as a rule on a permanent residency basis (though sometimes doubling elsewhere), certain ranks and positions were created specifically for multilateral diplomacy:
*An [[ambassador-at-large]] is equivalent to an ambassador and assigned specific tasks or region in which he is assigned various assignments aimed at multi track diplomacy.
*A [[permanent representative]] is the equivalent of an ambassador, normally of that rank, but accredited to an international body (mainly by member—and possibly observer states), not to a head of state.
*A [[resident (title)|resident representative]] (or sometimes simply ''representative'') is also a member of the diplomatic corps, but is below the rank of ambassador. A representative is accredited by an international organization (generally a [[:Category:United Nations specialized agencies|United Nations agency]], or a [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] institution) to a country's government. The resident representative typically heads the country office of that international organization within that country.
*A '''special ambassador or honorary ambassador''' is a government's specialist diplomat in a particular field, not posted in residence, but often traveling around the globe.
*The [[Office of the United States Trade Representative|U.S.&amp;nbsp;Trade Representative]] (USTR) is an ambassador of Cabinet rank, in charge of U.S. delegations in multilateral trade negotiations (since 1962). The USTR's Special Agricultural Negotiator also typically holds an ambassadorial appointment.

====Special Envoy====
Special envoys have been created ''ad hoc'' by individual countries, treaties and international organizations including the United Nations. A few examples are provided below:

* Belgium: In 2005, former cabinet member Pierre Chevalier served as ''Special Envoy of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] presidency'' to mediate in the [[Gazprom]] natural gas-pipeline crisis involving Russia, [[Ukraine]], and the [[European Union]]. In addition, [[Princess Astrid of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Astrid of Belgium]] has served as ''Special Envoy of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention or [[Ottawa Treaty]],'' to promote the formal prohibition of [[Land mine|landmines]] and the rights of the survivors of said weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apminebanconvention.org/newsroom/press-release-archives/archives-2013/detail/article/1371722802-princess-astrid-of-belgium-to-serve-as-special-envoy-of-the-convention/|title=PRINCESS ASTRID OF BELGIUM TO SERVE AS SPECIAL ENVOY OF THE CONVENTION|last=|first=|date=2013-06-20|website=Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[India]]: During the [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal]], India sent on April 18 [[Karan Singh]], who is related to royalty in both predominantly Hindu countries, as ''Special Envoy'' to neighbouring [[Nepal]] where increasingly violent opposition started its successful challenge of the king's autocratic rule. Another instance was during the 2009 Copenhagen climate change summit, India appointed senior diplomat [[Shyam Saran]] as a special envoy to coordinate the negotiating position of the [[BASIC countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/6078 |title=Meeting Shyam Saran &amp;#124; Worldwatch Institute |publisher=Worldwatch.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[United Kingdom]]: appointed special envoys from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2008-07-14c.211748.h |title=Ministerial Policy Advisers: 14 Jul 2008: Hansard Written Answers |publisher=TheyWorkForYou |date= |accessdate=2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* European Union: appointed various ''special representatives'' (some regional, some thematic); e.g.,&amp;nbsp;in 2005—as a response to events in [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]—the Council of the EU appointed [[Ján Kubiš|Jan Kubis]] as its "Special Representative for Central Asia".
* [[Pakistan]]: Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] Appointed Ambassador [[Javed Malik]] as Pakistan's Special Envoy for Trade &amp; Investment based in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC]] Gulf region with a diplomatic rank of an Ambassador
* United States: appointed numerous special envoys including a [[United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland|Special Envoy for Northern Ireland]] with the diplomatic rank of ambassador to help with the [[Northern Ireland peace process]]. As of 2014, the position was occupied by [[Gary Hart]]. Special Envoys have been appointed for [[Sudan]], [[Syria]], [[Middle East Peace]], Eurasian Energy, Climate Change, and Human Rights in North Korea. Other posts include Special Representative, Special Advisor, and Special Coordinator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/s/index.htm |title=Bureaus/Offices Reporting Directly to the Secretary |publisher=State.gov |date=2009-01-20 |accessdate=2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] personally mandates special envoys for a particular field, including:
**[[United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa]]
**[[United Nations Special Envoy on Climate Change]]
**[[United Nations Special Envoy for Kosovo]]
**[[United Nations Special Envoy for Darfur]]
**[[United Nations Special Envoy for Refugees]]
* The [[UNESCO#Director-General|Director-General of UNESCO]] appoints special envoys who can use their talents and renown to further the organization's ideals and action. Envoys include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/goodwill-ambassadors/special-envoys/|title=UNESCO Special Envoys|publisher=unesco.org |date=2018-06-26 |accessdate=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Special Envoy for Basic and Higher Education: HH [[Moza bint Nasser|Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser al-Missned]] of Qatar
** Special Envoy for Water: HRH Prince [[Talal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Talal bin Abdulaziz al Saud]]
** Special Envoy on Literacy for Development: HRH [[Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands]]
* A ''[[sui generis]]'' case is the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]].
* Australia: In August 2018, two "Special Envoy" positions were created by Scott Morrison: [[Barnaby Joyce]] became Special Envoy for Drought assistance and recovery&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/prime-minister-scott-morrison-reveals-new-cabinet-20180826-p4zzve.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tony Abbott]] became special envoy for Indigenous Affairs &lt;ref&gt;https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/tony-abbott-holds-out-on-scott-morrison-s-special-envoy-offer-20180827-p4zzyp.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage worldwide==
Most countries worldwide have some form of internal rank, roughly parallel to the diplomatic ranks, which are used in their [[Foreign Service Institute|foreign service]] or [[civil service]] in general. The correspondence is not exact, however, for various reasons, including the fact that according to diplomatic usage, all Ambassadors are of equal rank, but Ambassadors of more senior rank are typically sent to more important postings. Some countries may make specific links or comparisons to [[military rank]]s.

===Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade===
Officers from the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] (DFAT) are graded into four broad bands (BB1 to BB4), with the Senior Executive Service (SES Band&amp;nbsp;1 to SES Band&amp;nbsp;3) following above.

Ambassadors, High Commissioners and Consuls-General usually come from the Senior Executive Service, although in smaller posts the head of mission may be a BB4&amp;nbsp;officer. Generally speaking (and there are variations in ranking and nomenclature between posts and positions), Counsellors are represented by BB4&amp;nbsp;officers; Consuls and First and Second Secretaries are BB3&amp;nbsp;officers and Third Secretaries and Vice Consuls are BB2&amp;nbsp;officers. DFAT only posts a limited number of low-level BB1&amp;nbsp;staff abroad. In large [[Diplomatic missions of Australia|Australian missions]] an SES&amp;nbsp;officer who is not the head of mission could be posted with the rank of Minister.

===Brazilian Diplomatic Service===
There are six ranks in the Brazilian Ministry of External Affairs (''{{lang|pt-BR|Itamaraty}}''):

* ''{{lang|pt-BR|Terceiro-Secretário}}'' ("Third secretary")
* ''{{lang|pt-BR|Segundo-Secretário}}'' ("Second secretary")
* ''{{lang|pt-BR|Primeiro-Secretário}}'' ("First secretary")
* ''{{lang|pt-BR|Conselheiro}}'' ("Counsellor")
* ''{{lang|pt-BR|Ministro de Segunda Classe}}'' ("Minister, second class")
* ''{{lang|pt-BR|Ministro de Primeira Classe}}'' ("Minister, first class")

''{{lang|pt-BR|Embaixador}}'' is the honorary dignity conceded permanently when a Minister of First Class assumes a Post overseas. It can also be a temporary assignment, when carried on by a lower-rank diplomat or Brazilian politician of high level.

===British Diplomatic Service===
[[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service]] differentiates between officers in the "Senior Management Structure" (SMS; equivalent to the Senior Civil Service grades of the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Home Civil Service]]) and those in the "delegated grades".  SMS officers are classified into three pay-bands, and will serve in the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] in London as (in descending order of seniority) [[Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Permanent Under-Secretary]], Directors-General, Directors, or Heads of Department; overseas they will be Ambassadors (High Commissioners in Commonwealth countries), or Consuls-General, Deputy Heads of Mission or Counsellors for larger posts. (Deputy Heads of Mission at the historically most significant Embassies, for example those [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Washington, D.C.|in Washington]] and [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Paris|in Paris]], are known as Ministers.)

In the "delegated grades", officers are graded by number from 1 to 7; the grades are grouped into bands lettered A‑D (grades 1 and 2 are in Band A; 3 in B; 4 and 5 in C; and 6 and 7 in D). Overseas, A2&amp;nbsp;grade officers hold the title of Attache, B3‑grade officers are Third Secretaries; C4s are Second Secretaries; and C5s and D6s are First Secretaries. D7&amp;nbsp;officers are usually Deputy Heads of Mission in medium-sized posts or Heads of Mission in small posts.

===Egyptian Diplomatic Service===
The following ranks are used in the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs:

* Diplomatic Attaché
* Third Secretary
* Second Secretary
* First Secretary
* Counselor
* Minister Plenipotentiary
* Ambassador

===[[France|French]] Diplomatic Service===

There are five ranks in the French Diplomatic Service:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do;jsessionid=3BAC33F648261FEFE7F013FD4A55464E.tplgfr36s_1?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006271572&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006061620&amp;dateTexte=20180407&lt;/ref&gt;
(in ascending order)
* ''{{lang|fr|Secrétaire de chancellerie}}''
* ''{{lang|fr|Secrétaire des affaires étrangères}}''
* ''{{lang|fr|Conseiller des affaires étrangères}}''
* ''{{lang|fr|Ministre plénipotentiaire}}'', the most common rank for [[head of mission|heads of mission]], but it also applies to some ministers-counsellors in important embassies
* ''{{lang|fr|Ambassadeur de France}}'', an honorary dignity

There are two additional ranks for ICT specialists (also in ascending order):

* ''{{lang|fr|Secrétaire des systèmes d'information et de communication}}''
* ''{{lang|fr|Attaché des systèmes d'information et de communication}}''

=== Italian diplomatic career ===
In [[Italy]], ranks and functions are not exactly connected: each rank can cover several functions.  Moreover, several exceptions apply.

* ''{{lang|it|Segretario di legazione in prova}}'' ("Secretary of Legation in probation period"): 9-month training period at the beginning of the career (no other functions)
* ''{{lang|it|Segretario di legazione}}'' ("Secretary of Legation"): second secretary at an embassy, head of vice-consulate, vice-consul
* ''{{lang|it|Consigliere di legazione}}'' ("Counsellor of Legation"): counsellor at an embassy, consul (head of a first-class general consulate)
* ''{{lang|it|Consigliere d'ambasciata}}'' ("Counsellor of Embassy"): first counsellor at an embassy, consul
* ''{{lang|it|Ministro plenipotenziario}}'' ("Minister Plenipotentiary"): ambassador (as for functions), minister-counsellor at an embassy, head of a Directorate at the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]
* ''{{lang|it|Ambasciatore}}'' ("Ambassador"): ambassador (thus both as for the rank and for the functions), General Secretary or head of a Directorate at the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]

There are about 30 people who hold the rank of Ambassador.  Therefore, most of the about 150 Italian embassies or permanent representations are held by a Minister Plenipotentiary: traditionally, ambassadors are appointed to the most important representations, such as [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], [[New Delhi]] and [[Peking]] embassies and representations to the [[United Nations|UN]] in [[New York City]] and the [[European Union|EU]] in [[Brussels]].

===[[Spain|Spanish]] Diplomatic Corps===

After the merger of the Consular and Diplomatic Corps, the current eight grades of Spanish career diplomats are (in ascending order):
* ''{{lang|es|Funcionario en prácticas}}'' ("Trainee Diplomat"): title held during the one-year training program at the Diplomatic School.
* ''{{lang|es|Secretario de Embajada de tercera clase}}'' ("Embassy Secretary, Third Class") or Secretary.
* ''{{lang|es|Secretario de Embajada de segunda clase}}'' ("Embassy Secretary, Second Class")
* ''{{lang|es|Secretario de Embajada de primera clase}}''. ("Embassy Secretary, First Class")
* ''{{lang|es|Consejero}}'' or ''{{lang|es|Concillor}}'', lowest grade to be appointed Consul-General.
* ''{{lang|es|Ministro Plenipotenciario de tercera clase}}'' ("Minister Plenipotentiary, Third Class") commonly known as Minister, lowest grade to be appointed Ambassador.
* ''{{lang|es|Ministro Plenipotenciario de segunda clase}}''. ("Minister Plenipotentiary, Second Class")
* ''{{lang|es|Ministro Plenipotenciario de primera clase}}''. ("Minister Plenipotentiary, First Class")
* ''{{lang|es|Embajador de España}}'' ("Ambassador of Spain"): not all Spanish Ambassadors hold this grade, which is limited by law to 3% of the total Corps.

===[[United States Foreign Service]]===
In the United States Foreign Service, the personnel system under which most U.S. diplomatic personnel are assigned, a system of personal ranks is applied which roughly corresponds to these diplomatic ranks. Personal ranks are differentiated as "[[Senior Foreign Service]]" (SFS) or "Member of the Foreign Service".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/03FAM/03FAM2230.html|format=PDF|title=3 FAM 2230 Appointments – Categories of Foreign Service Personnel|publisher=State.gov|accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Officers at these ranks may serve as ambassadors and occupy the most senior positions in diplomatic missions.  The SFS ranks, in order from highest to lowest, are:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  SFS rank
!  [[Uniformed services pay grades of the United States|Equivalent military rank]]
!  Notes
|-
| [[List of United States Foreign Service Career Ambassadors|Career Ambassador]] (FE-CA) || [[Four-star rank]] (O-10) || Awarded to career diplomats with extensive and distinguished service
|-
| Career Minister (FE-CM) || [[Three-star rank]] (O-9) || The highest regular senior rank
|-
| Minister Counselor (FE-MC) || [[Two-star rank]] (O-8) ||
|-
| Counselor (FE-OC) || [[One-star rank]] (O-7) ||
|}

Members of the Foreign Service consist of five groups, including [[Foreign Service Officer]]s and [[Foreign Service Specialists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careers.state.gov/work/foreign-service |title=Worldwide/Foreign Service - U.S. Department of State |publisher=Careers.state.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like officers in the U.S. military, Foreign Service Officers are members of the Foreign Service who are commissioned by the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/03FAH01/03FAH012430.html |format=PDF |title=3 FAH-1 H-2430 Commissions, Titles and Rank |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with Warrant Officers in the U.S. military, Foreign Service Specialists are technical leaders and experts, commissioned not by the President but by the Secretary of State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/03FAM/03FAM2230.html |format=PDF |title=3 FAM 2230 Categories of Foreign Service Personnel |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ranks descend from the highest, FS‑1, [[General Schedule#Military rank equivalency|equivalent]] to a full [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] in the military, to FS‑9, the lowest rank in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Foreign Service personnel system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/15FAM/15FAM0260.html|format=PDF|title=15 FAM 260 Guidelines for Allocating Residential Space|publisher=State.gov|accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Most entry-level Foreign Service members begin at the FS‑5 or FS‑6 level.) Personal rank is distinct from and should not be confused with the diplomatic or consular rank assigned at the time of appointment to a particular diplomatic or consular mission.

In a large mission, several Senior Diplomats may serve under the Ambassador as Minister-Counselors, Counselors, and First Secretaries; in a small mission, a diplomat may serve as the lone Counselor of Embassy.

==[[Consul (representative)|Consular]] counterpart==
Formally the [[consul (representative)|consular career]] (ranking in descending order: consul-general, consul, vice-consul, consular agent; equivalents with [[consular immunity]] limited to official acts only include honorary consul-general, honorary consul, and honorary vice-consul) forms a separate hierarchy. Many countries do not internally have a separate consular path or stream, and the meaning of "consular" responsibilities and functions will differ from country to country. Other titles, including "vice consul-general", have existed in the past. Consular titles may be used concurrently with diplomatic titles if the individual is assigned to an embassy. Diplomatic immunity is more limited for consular officials without other diplomatic accreditation, and broadly limited to immunity with respect to their official duties.

At a separate consular post, the official will have only a consular title. Officials at consular posts may therefore have consular titles, but not be involved in traditional consular activities, and actually be responsible for trade, cultural, or other matters.

Consular officers, being nominally more distant from the politically sensitive aspects of diplomacy, can more easily render a wide range of services to private citizens, enterprises, et cetera. They may be more numerous since diplomatic missions are posted only in a nation's capital, while consular officials are stationed in various other cities as well. However, it is not uncommon for individuals to be transferred from one hierarchy to the other, and for consular officials to serve in a capital carrying out strictly consular duties within the "consular section" of a diplomatic post, e.g.,&amp;nbsp;within an embassy. Some countries routinely provide their embassy officials with [[consular commission]]s, including those without formal consular responsibilities, since a consular commission allows the individual to legalize documents, sign certain documents, and undertake certain other necessary functions.

Depending on the practice of the individual country, "consular services" may be limited to services provided for citizens or residents of the sending country, or extended to include, for example, visa services for nationals of the host country.

Sending nations may also designate incumbents of certain positions as holding consulary authority by virtue of their office, while lacking individual accreditation, immunity and inviolability.  For example, 10&amp;nbsp;U.S.C. §§&amp;nbsp;936 and 1044a identify various U.S.&amp;nbsp;military officers (and authorize the service secretaries to identify others) who hold general authority as a notary and consul of the United States for, respectively, purposes of military administration and those entitled to military legal assistance. A nation may also declare that its senior merchant sea captain in a given foreign [[port]]—or its merchant sea captains generally—has consulary authority for merchant seamen.

'''Ethnic hatred''', '''inter-ethnic hatred''', '''racial hatred''', or '''ethnic tension''' refers to feelings  and acts of [[prejudice]] and hostility towards an [[ethnic group]] in various degrees. See [[list of anti-ethnic and anti-national terms]] for specific cases. 

There are multiple origins for ethnic hatred and the resulting [[ethnic conflict]]s. In some societies it is rooted in [[tribalism]], while in others it originates from a history of non-peaceful co-existence and the resulting actual disputed issues. 

Often ethnic conflict is enhanced by [[nationalism]] and feeling of national superiority. For which reason inter-ethnic hatred borders with [[racism]], and often the two terms are conflated.

Ethnic hatred has often been exploited and even fueled by some political leaders to serve their agenda of seeking to consolidate the nation or gain electorate by calling for a united struggle against a common enemy (real or imaginary).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/ind-pak/2002/0707ethnic.htm Using Ethnic Hatred to Meet Political Ends] (about ethnic problems in Indian subcontinent)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In many countries [[incitement to ethnic or racial hatred]] is a [[criminal offense]].

== Role of media ==
Media persuasion plays a role in dissemination of [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] hatred. Media presence spreads underlying messages that negatively portrays certain ethnic groups to the eye of the public. For example, political elites use media exposure to influence the views of the viewers towards a certain [[propaganda]]. In 1930s Nazi Germany, media presence in exposing propaganda in terms of hatred was effectively organized by Joseph Goebbels.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrova|first=Maria|last2=Yanagizawa-Drott|first2=David|date=2016-07-01|title=Media Persuasion, Ethnic Hatred, and Mass Violence: A Brief Overview of Recent Research Advances|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199378296.001.0001/acprof-9780199378296-chapter-12|language=en-US|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199378296.001.0001/acprof-9780199378296-chapter-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;Although, Recent US Data (Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee 1954; Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet 1944) shows media as a tool that does not carry “significant independent influence,” media “strengthens people’s predispositions.” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;Furthermore, Exogenous variation plays a role in utilizing media content towards escalating ethnic hatred presence according to recent economic studies. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;The effects of media on people varies in different platforms strengthening mass medias influence towards the public. Data polled from Muslim countries shows that exposure to Al-Jazeera is associated with higher levels of reported anti-Americanism in contrast to exposure to CNN associating with less anti-Americanism. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are two types of persuasion: direct and indirect. Direct persuasion in regard to mass media exponentially expands hatred that leads to violence of ethnic groups. Indirect persuasion exports hatred and directs behavior towards executing violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The continuous use of mass media as an apparatus to spread negative image of ethnic groups is seen throughout variations of history. Most media hate speech that amplified worldwide attention are experienced in Rwanda and Yugoslavia. Also, Media’s control of hate speech that Nazi and fascist parties manipulate agitate and attract followers into advocating for hatred and violence. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arcan|first=H. Esra|date=2013-10-01|title=Ethnic Conflicts and the Role of the Media: The Case of Turkish Media|url=http://www.mcser.org/journal/index.php/mjss/article/view/1196|journal=Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences|language=en|volume=4|issue=10|pages=338|doi=10.5901/mjss.2013.v4n10p338|issn=2039-2117}}&lt;/ref&gt;Today, [[Social media|Social Media]] plays a role in ethnic conflicts in Kenya. [[Ethnicity]] is a big part in determining voting patterns in Kenya; however, many associate ethnicity with grievances that mobilize patterns of differences, hatred, and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ndonye|first=Michael  M.|title=Social Media, Ethnic hatred and Peace Journalism: Case of Twitter and FaceBook use in Kenya.|url=http://www.academia.edu/7305771/Social_Media_Ethnic_hatred_and_Peace_Journalism_Case_of_Twitter_and_FaceBook_use_in_Kenya|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PropagandaNaziStabsBible.gif|thumb|Propaganda designed by Barbara J. Marks that shows viable medium of persuasion and information. ]]

== Propaganda ==
Along with mass media, propaganda plays as much role in distributing messages in terms of ethnic hatred. Propaganda is highly associated with totalitarian regimes in the twentieth century such as 1984 and [[Animal Farm]] by George Orwell that paved a way of commentating the regimes during the time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media, Persuasion, and Propaganda|last=Soules|first=Marshall|publisher=Edinburgh University Press Ltd|year=2015|isbn=978 0 7486 4415 5|location=The Tun - Holyrood Road 12 (2f) Jackson's Entry Edinburgh EH8 8PJ|pages=4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;However, propaganda is dangerous when utilized negatively. In original meaning, propaganda promotes beliefs leading towards action.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;Alternatively, Jowett and O’Donnell defines propaganda as ‘deliberate, systematic attempt to shape perceptions, manipulate cognitions, and direct behavior to achieve a response that furthers the desired intent of the propagandist’.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;The definition shows self-interested manipulation – an assumption that is difficult to prove. Negatively, propaganda presents “organised myth” that limits the chance of discovering the truth. The utilization of propaganda by Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini popularize the false impression of propaganda that hid the truth for an extended time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;In addition, there are complex influences that emerged during the propaganda campaigns of the [[World War I|Great War]] (1914-18) and [[Russian Revolution]] (1917) such as telegraphs, newspapers, photography, radio, film, large corporations seeking new markets, rise of reform-minded journalism, and the influence of art movements, psychology, sociology, and marketing.The variation of propaganda and psychological warfare are essentially organized processes of persuasion. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4751">'''European Commission against Racism and Intolerance''' ('''ECRI''') is the [[Council of Europe]]’s independent [[human rights]] monitoring body specialised in combating [[antisemitism]], [[discrimination]], [[racism]], [[religious intolerance]], and [[xenophobia]]. It publishes periodic reports on CoE member states and general policy recommendations. The decision to found ECRI was adopted in 1993. The organization became officially active as of March 1994.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55664994|title=Minority rights in Europe : a review of the work and standards of the Council of Europe|last=Patrick.|first=Thornberry,|date=2004|publisher=Council of Europe Pub.|others=Martín Estébanez, María Amor., Council of Europe.|isbn=9287153663|location=Strasbourg|oclc=55664994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
'''ECRI''' consists of 47 experts, one from every [[Council of Europe|CoE]] member state. The chair of the commission is [[Jean-Paul Lehners]] from Luxembourg, since 2017. 

Each ECRI member is allowed a renewable term of five years through appointing by their respective governments. To maintain membership, they must also abide by these terms of the ECRI Statute:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/495781775|title=The European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) : Its first 15 Years|last=Lanna.|first=Hollo,|date=2009|publisher=Council of Europe Pub|others=Council of Europe.|isbn=9789287166302|location=Strasbourg|oclc=495781775}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;The members of ECRI shall have high moral authority and recognised expertise in dealing with racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, antisemitism, and intolerance; The members of ECRI shall serive in their individual capacity, shall be independent and impartial in fulfilling their mandate. They shall not receive any instructions from their government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/about/ecri_statute_EN.asp|title=ECRI Statute|website=www.coe.int|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The first ECRI chair was the Swedish Discrimination Ombudsman Frank Orton, who held the position until 1998.&lt;ref&gt;ECRI reports CRI (94)1:6 and CRI (97)76:1, 31 and 51.&lt;/ref&gt;It was his idea that the commission should undertake its now well-known country-by-country studies, aimed at providing the member states with country-specific advice how to combat racism and related intolerance.

Former ECRI chairs include Nikos Frangakis,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/activities/Annual_Reports/Annual%20Report%201998_en.asp#TopOfPage ECRI 1998 report - Appendix 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Head,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/activities/Annual_Reports/Annual_Report_2004_en.asp#TopOfPage ECRI 2004 report - Appendix 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Eva Smith Asmussen&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/activities/Annual_Reports/Annual_Report_2005_en.asp#TopOfPage ECRI 2005 report - Appendix 1]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nils Muižnieks]].

== Actions ==
The main purpose of the ECRI is to provide a constructive critique, called a General Policy Report (GPR), to countries on their actions and legislature to improve the welfare of the minority groups residing within the nation. The ECRI also pens its reports itself, and not the country being examined, which differentiates it from [[CERD]] at the United Nations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Merja Pentikainen relays the ECRI's desire for immigrants and resident non-EU citizens' full integration and participation in EU societies. In particular, the ECRI is a strong advocate of the integration of the [[Romani people|Romani]] people in European society and Romani children in EU school systems. In fact, the Romani are the main objects of attention in most of the organization's calls for integration. However, while racism and discrimination have always been a large part of the ECRI agenda, integration has only started to make prominent appearances in recent GPRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pentikainen|first=Merja|date=2015|title=Social Integration of “Old” and “New” Minorities in Europe in Views of International Expert Bodies Relying on Human Rights: Contextual Balancing and Tailoring|url=http://www.ecmi.de/fileadmin/downloads/publications/JEMIE/2015/Pentikainen.pdf|journal=Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe|volume=14|pages=26-47|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8549">'''Experience management''' is the activity where organizations measure and improve the various experiences they provide, not only to customers, but to all their [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] like vendors, suppliers, employees, and shareholders. It is premised on the idea that experiences are a distinct economic offering, that create economic value and competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 24 March 2017|url = https://hbr.org/1998/07/welcome-to-the-experience-economy|title = Welcome to the Experience Economy|publisher = Harvard Business Review|author = B.

Organizations are increasingly collecting experience data as opposed to operational data, since experiences are seen as a [[competitive advantage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 24 March 2017|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucerogers/2017/03/02/ryan-smiths-qualtrics-capitalizes-on-the-rise-of-the-experience-economy/#1e9a9d276221|title = Ryan Smith's Qualtrics Capitalizes On The Rise Of The 'Experience Economy'|publisher = Forbes |author = Bruce Rogers|date = 2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 25 March 2017|url = http://www.haaga-helia.fi/en/opinto-opas/opintojaksokuvaukset/DES8RB024|title = Experience Management|publisher = Haaga-Helia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experience management platforms provide various services to automate the process of identifying and improving experiences across an organization.&lt;ref name=Signage /&gt;

Broader than [[customer experience]], experience management now encompasses customer experience along with other areas, such as [[brand management|brand experience]], [[employee experience design|employee experience]] and product experience, which are all seen as interrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 24 March 2017|url = http://www.marketing-trends-congress.com/archives/2010/Materiali/DoctoralColloquium/Kreuzer.pdf|title = An embodied cognition approach to the study of consumer brand knowledge|publisher = Marketing Trends Congress|author = Maria Kreuzer|date = November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 24 March 2017|url = https://www.amazon.com/Enhancing-Employee-Experience-Organizational-contribute/dp/3639138163|title = Enhancing the Employee Experience: Organizational practices that contribute to employee engagement|publisher = VDM Verlag|author = Linda Heska|date = 10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 29 March 2017|url = http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/building-a-design-driven-culture|title = Building a design-driven culture|publisher = McKinsey&amp;Company|author = Jennifer Kilian, Hugo Sarrazin, and Hyo Yeon|date = September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1994 Steve Haeckel and Lou Carbone collaborated on a seminal early article on experience management, titled "Engineering Customer Experiences," where they defined experience as "the 'take-away' impression formed by people's encounters  with  products,  services  and  businesses — a perception produced  when  humans  consolidate  [[sense|sensory  information]]." They argued that the new approach must focus on total experience as the key customer [[value proposition]].&lt;ref name=Schmitt /&gt;

The concept reached a wide audience in 1999, when it was popularized by B. Joseph Pine II and James H. Gilmore in their book ''[[The Experience Economy|Experience Economy]]''.&lt;ref name=Schmitt&gt;{{cite book|last = Schmitt|first = Bernd |date = 2011|title = Experience Marketing: Concepts, Frameworks and Consumer Insights|url = https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/sites/globalbrands/files/Experience%20Marketing%20-%20Schmitt%20-%20Foundations%20and%20Trends%202011.pdf|publisher = Columbia Business School|page = 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, [[Bernd Schmitt]] published ''Experiential Marketing: How to Get Customers to Sense, Feel, Think, Act, and Relate to Your Company and Brands.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 25 March 2017|url = https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/researcharchive/articles/335|title = Experiential Marketing: How to Get Customers to Sense, Feel, Think, Act, and Relate to Your Company and Brands|publisher = Columbia Business School|author = Bernd Schmitt|date = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, experience management emerged as a complex field unifying the experiences of brands, employees, products and more. It was acknowledged that generating new experiences for end customers requires designing better experiences for internal players of an organization. Value is created by focusing on the experiences of everyone involved in or affected by a new offer, such as customers, employees, suppliers, and other [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 29 March 2017|url = https://hbr.org/2010/10/building-the-co-creative-enterprise|title = Building the Co-Creative Enterprise|publisher = Harvard Business Review|author = Venkat Ramaswamy and Francis Gouillart|date = October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==

To create and manage the experiences, businesses must evaluate, implement, integrate, and build experiences from a fragmented landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 25 March 2017|url = https://www.forrester.com/report/Vendor+Landscape+Digital+Experience+Platforms/-/E-RES104302|title = Vendor Landscape: Digital Experience Platforms|publisher = Forrester|author = Mark Grannan, Danielle Geoffroy|date = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such needs are met by experience management platforms, which help automate the process of measuring and improving experiences across an organization by coordinating content, customer data and core services, and unifying marketing, commerce and service processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 25 March 2017|url = https://www.loyalty360.org/loyalty-today/article/11-tech-trends-you-can-bet-your-customer-experienc|title = 11 Tech Trends You Can Bet Your Customer Experience Budgets On, Today through 2020...|publisher = Loyalty 360|author = MCorpCX|date = 3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Signage&gt;{{cite web|accessdate= 25 March 2017|url = https://www.digitalsignagetoday.com/articles/intel-webinar-zooms-in-on-digital-experience-management-platforms-2/|title = Intel webinar zooms in on digital experience management platforms|publisher = Digital Signage Today|author = Bradley Cooper|date = 21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experience management platforms compare multiple layers of data and statistics to enable organizations to identify any experience gaps. They connect [[operational database]]s with human feedback, analyzing respondents' emotions, beliefs, and sentiments for a holistic view of the experiences they provide. Their methods include [[artificial intelligence]], [[predictive analytics]], and [[statistical models]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 25 March 2017|url = http://www.heraldextra.com/business/local/qualtrics-quantifies-and-enhances-the-experience-economy-in-new-platform/article_92d96208-2556-5a04-9aad-5172da9d412f.html|title = Qualtrics quantifies and enhances the 'experience economy' in new platform|publisher = Daily Herald|author = Karissa Neely|date = 2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==

While the term ''experience management'' is predominantly used in business, it has another meaning. It is used for a special kind of [[knowledge management]] that deals with collecting, modeling, storing, reusing, evaluating, and maintaining experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Bergmann|first = Ralph|date = 2002|title = Experience Management|url = https://books.google.hr/books?id=rq-qCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=%22experience+management%22+-customer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YaG7Y6gPuC&amp;sig=kc-SBM0Xwmsx6C2Z7lfOkMGhpCg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje_v759-_SAhVmKpoKHVvxB1k4ChDoAQhoMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22experience%20management%22%20-customer&amp;f=false|publisher = Springer|location = Google Books|page = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, the term is interchangeable with ''expertise management''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 24 March 2017|url = https://info.legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/signup/newsletters/practice-innovations/2015-mar/article4.aspx|title = Experience Management: Build, Buy, or Abandon?|publisher = Legal Solutions|author = Lisa Gianakos|date = March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fort Lee lane closure scandal''', also known as the '''George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal''' or '''Bridgegate''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Harry |last= Bruinius |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2014/0131/Bridge-gate-Key-figure-says-Chris-Christie-knew-about-lane-closures|title=Bridge-gate: Key figure says Chris Christie knew about lane closures (+video)|work= The Christian Science Monitor |date=January 31, 2013|accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Leslie |last=Larson |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/christie-campaign-seeks-funds-cover-bridgegate-legal-costs-article-1.1598183|title=Christie campaign seeks funds to cover Bridgegate legal costs|work=[[Daily News (New York)]] |date=January 31, 2014|accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a U.S. [[political scandal]] in which a staff member and political appointees of [[Governor of New Jersey|New Jersey Governor]] [[Chris Christie]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], colluded to create [[Traffic congestion|traffic jams]] in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]], by closing lanes at the [[George Washington Bridge Plaza|main toll plaza]]&lt;ref name="Ft.

The problems began on Monday, September 9, 2013, when two of three toll lanes for a local street entrance were closed during morning [[rush hour]]. Local officials, emergency services, and the public were not notified of the lane closures, which Fort Lee declared a threat to public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alcindor|first=Yamiche|title=Fort Lee traffic jam caused human debacle|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/09/fort-lee-traffic-jam-caused-human-debacle/4397381/|accessdate=February 17, 2014|work=USA Today|date=January 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting back-ups and [[gridlock]] on local streets ended only when the two lanes were reopened on Friday, September 13, 2013, by an order from [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port Authority]] Executive Director [[Patrick Foye]]. He said that the "hasty and ill-informed decision" could have endangered lives and violated federal and state laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/region-state/pa-chief-patrick-foye-s-email-on-george-washington-bridge-closures-1.6774938|title=PA chief Patrick Foye's email on George Washington Bridge closures|work=Newsday|accessdate=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was later suggested that the lanes had been closed to intentionally cause the massive traffic problem for political reasons, and especially theorized that they were a retribution attack against Fort Lee's Mayor [[Mark Sokolich]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who had not supported Christie as a candidate in the [[New Jersey gubernatorial election, 2013|2013 New Jersey gubernatorial election]]. The ensuing investigations centered on several of Christie's appointees and staff, including&lt;ref name="samsonblasting"&gt;{{cite news|last=Strunsky|first=Steve|title=Chris Christie bridge scandal: documents show Port Authority chairman blasting executive director|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/01/bridge_scandal_documents_port_authority_chairman_blasts_executive_director.html|work=[[The Star-Ledger]] |location= Newark, NJ |date=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Updated timeline"&gt;{{cite news |last= Baxter |first= Christopher |title= Updated: Timeline of Port Authority's George Washington Bridge controversy |url= http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/03/timeline_of_the_port_authoritys_george_washington_bridge_lane_closure_controversy.html|work= The Star-Ledger|location= Newark, NJ |date=March 11, 2014|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Wildstein]], who ordered the lanes closed,&lt;ref name="wildsteinphoto"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mann|first=Ted|title=Christie, official who arranged bridge closures were together during fiasco |url= https://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/01/14/christie-official-who-arranged-bridge-closures-together-during-fiasco|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bill Baroni]], who had told the [[New Jersey General Assembly|New Jersey Assembly]] Transportation Committee that the closures were for a [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic study]].&lt;ref name="Record Timeline" /&gt;

During the week of August 4, 2013, Christie met with [[David Samson (New Jersey)|David Samson]], Christie's appointed chairman of the Board of Commissioners of the Port Authority. The [[Speaker (politics)|deputy speaker]] of the [[New Jersey General Assembly|New Jersey Assembly]], [[John Wisniewski]], who, as chair of the Assembly Transportation Committee had been leading the Assembly's investigation into the closures, alleged that David Wildstein, the Christie appointee who ordered the closures, must have believed the meeting was related to the lane closures, because a reference to the meeting was included in the [[subpoena]]ed documents Wildstein submitted in which all information not pertaining to the Fort Lee lane closures had been [[Sanitization (classified information)|redacted]].&lt;ref name="meeting between Christie and Samson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Foster|first=David|title=Wisniewski: Meeting occurred between Port Authority Chairman and Gov.

On September 6, Wildstein instructed George Washington Bridge manager Robert Durando not to tell anyone in Fort Lee about the upcoming closure, not even the police. When Durando questioned the order, which he thought was "odd" since he had never been instructed in his 35-year career not to tell host town officials about an event that would disrupt traffic, Wildstein told him "it would impact the study" if people knew and Wildstein "wanted to see what would naturally happen".&lt;ref name=Durando&gt;{{cite news|last=Boburg|first=Shawn|title=Democrats call for resignation of Christie appointee after Assembly hearings on GWB lane closures|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/transportation/Documents_show_Port_Authority_knew_GWB_lane_closures_would_cause_major_trouble_for_commuters.html?page=all|work=The Record|location=Woodland Park, NJ|date=December 9, 2013|accessdate=January 14, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113010415/http://www.northjersey.com/news/transportation/Documents_show_Port_Authority_knew_GWB_lane_closures_would_cause_major_trouble_for_commuters.html?page=all|archivedate=January 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an area that normally experiences a great deal of traffic, the lane closings caused a significant increase in traffic congestion.

Within hours of the closure, various Port Authority officials were being told that the traffic delays posed a threat to public safety. At 9:29&amp;nbsp;a.m., Matthew Bell, a special assistant to Bill Baroni, e-mailed Baroni regarding "urgent matter of public safety in Fort Lee". Fort Lee [[City manager|Borough Administrator]] Peggy Thomas e-mailed the PA's director of government and community relations, Tina Lado, with her concerns, noting that police and emergency departments received no advance notice of the closures.&lt;ref name="Jaffe"&gt;{{cite news |first= Alexandra |last= Jaffe |url= http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/195148-emails-suggest-safety-warnings-about-closed-bridge-lanes |title= Emails Suggest Safety Warnings About Closed Bridge Lanes Ignored |work= The Hill |date= January 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 11:24&amp;nbsp;a.m., Lado e-mailed both Wildstein and Baroni informing them that due to the closures, police and ambulances were having difficulty responding to emergencies.

At the federal trial of Baroni and Kelly, Fort Lee Police Chief Keith Bendul testified that he had reached Durando on that Monday, who asked for a meeting not at the PA office, but in a nearby municipal parking lot. "I thought it was cloak and dagger." Durando spoke of the traffic study, and Bendul demanded its ending, citing the various safety problems. "I told [Durando] bluntly that if anybody dies, I'm going to tell those people to sue him and everybody at the Port Authority." A nervous Durando told Bendul that Sokolich should contact Baroni, and added that "if anybody asked if this meeting occurred, he [Durando] would deny it," Bendul testified.&lt;ref name="Zernike-Remnick-2016-09-20"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zernike|first1=Kate|last2=Remnick|first2=Noah|title=Fort Lee Officials Recall Chaos and Turmoil as Lanes to Bridge Were Closed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/nyregion/fort-lee-police-chief-recalls-chaos-and-turmoil-as-bridge-lanes-were-closed.html|accessdate=September 22, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Wednesday, September 11, Robert Durando said in a Port Authority e-mail that if the automated toll lanes were closed permanently in favor of one manned lane for local traffic, it would be "very expensive" since annual toll-collector costs would increase approximately $600,000. This would have covered overtime, as well as stationing reserve employees when a scheduled toll collector was not able to work. He said there would be additional, but still to be determined costs, for PA police due to their coverage of traffic for a greatly extended rush hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephanie|last=Akin|title=Tolled Bridge: Why Christie's failure matters far west of the Hudson|date=January 13, 2014|url=http://m.nationalreview.com/article/368247/tolled-bridge-nicole-gelinas/page/0/1|work=National Review|accessdate=January 26, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202112400/http://m.nationalreview.com/article/368247/tolled-bridge-nicole-gelinas/page/0/1|archivedate=February 2, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Link to Subpoenaed Documents Released on Jan. 8, 2014"/&gt;

Christie, Wildstein, Samson and Baroni were photographed together at the site of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] during a commemoration of the 12th anniversary of the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks]].&lt;ref name=wildsteinphoto/&gt; On that occasion, Wildstein later testified, Baroni sarcastically told Christie, "Governor, there is a tremendous amount of traffic in Fort Lee, please know Mayor Sokolich is frustrated he can't get his calls returned," to which Christie was said to have responded, "I imagine they wouldn't be getting their calls returned." According to Wildstein, Baroni then told Christie that Wildstein would monitor the traffic, and Christie responded, "Well, I'm sure Mr. Edge wouldn't be involved in anything political," and laughed.&lt;ref name="Reiss-2016-09-27"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reiss|first1=Adam|title=Chris Christie Knew of Traffic Scheme, Bridgegate Figure Says|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/chris-christie-knew-traffic-scheme-bridgegate-figure-says-n655481|accessdate=September 27, 2016|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Porter-2016-09-27"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Porter|first1=David|title=Ex-ally: Gov.

On Thursday, September 12, PA engineers said that reported delays for local traffic greatly exceeded any time savings for the major highway traffic based on reported information for vehicle travel times on Interstate 95 and local traffic counts from that week. In an internal PowerPoint presentation, it was estimated that the extra daily morning rush hour time, 2,800 vehicle-hours, endured by local traffic on a typical day greatly outweighed time savings, 966 vehicle-hours, for the I-95 traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Josh|last=Barro|title=They Actually DID Kind Of Do A Traffic Study On The George Washington Bridge: And Here Is What They Found|date=January 10, 2014|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/george-washington-bridge-davos-study-2014-1|work=Business Insider|accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his later testimony, John Ma (the chief of staff to the Port Authority's executive director, Patrick Foye), with Foye's knowledge beforehand, tipped off John Cichowski, the "Road Warrior" columnist for ''The Record''.

===Re-opening and immediate aftermath===
{{wikisource|Patrick Foye email of Sept 13 2013|Patrick Foye e-mail, September 13, 2013}}
On Friday morning, September 13, 2013, [[Patrick Foye]], the executive director of the Port Authority and an appointee of [[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Andrew Cuomo]], ordered that the lanes be reopened in a strongly worded 7:44 AM e-mail to senior PA officials and staff, including Bill Baroni and David Samson. In the e-mail, Foye called the decision to close the lanes "hasty and ill-advised", said that the decision violated policy and long-standing custom at the PA, and that he believed that closing the lanes "violates Federal Law and the laws of both States." Foye asked his spokesman to get the word out. Upon learning this, Baroni attempted to prevent any disclosure in order to keep the public in the dark.&lt;ref name="Published: January 10, 2014 6:38 PM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/region-state/pa-chief-patrick-foye-s-email-on-george-washington-bridge-closures-1.6774938|title=PA chief Patrick Foye's email on George Washington Bridge closures|work=Newsday|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soltis|first=Andy|date=January 10, 2014|title=Christie appointee ordered officials' silence on Bridgegate|url=https://nypost.com/2014/01/10/traffic-study-done-during-bridgegate-showed-chaos-it-caused|work=New York Post|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Baroni forwarded the e-mail to Regina Egea, Christie's Director of the authorities unit overseeing the PA, three hours after it was sent by Foye.&lt;ref name="Link to Subpoenaed Documents Released on Jan. 8, 2014"&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephanie|last=Akin|title=Breaking news: Thousands of documents released in Christie GWB scandal|date=January 10, 2014|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/new_documents_GWB_scandal_relased_today_by_Assembly_committee.html#sthash.FU4bFmLx.dpuf|work=The Record|location=Woodland Park, NJ|accessdate=January 11, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110235342/http://www.northjersey.com/news/new_documents_GWB_scandal_relased_today_by_Assembly_committee.html#sthash.FU4bFmLx.dpuf|archivedate=January 10, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christie scandal documents"&gt;{{cite web|title=What's in the Christie scandal documents|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/10/nearly-a-thousand-new-documents-released-in-n-j-bridge-scandal |work= politicalticker |publisher=CNN |author= Staff|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foye would later testify that Baroni met with him two times on that Friday, pressing for reinstatement of the closure, saying it was "important to [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]]," or else "Trenton" would call, which Foye understood to mean Christie's office. "I said they should call," Foye testified. "I opened [the lanes], I was not closing them." However, Foye did approve a press release that he knew falsely cited a "traffic study."&lt;ref name="Berger-Racioppi-2016-09-21"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berger|first1=Paul|last2=Racioppi|first2=Dustin|title=Bridgegate trial testimony exposes ugly side of New Jersey politics|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/bridgegate-trial-testimony-exposes-ugly-side-of-new-jersey-politics-1.1663752|accessdate=September 22, 2016|work=The Record|date=September 21, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922045031/http://www.northjersey.com/news/bridgegate-trial-testimony-exposes-ugly-side-of-new-jersey-politics-1.1663752|archivedate=September 22, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During and after the lane closures, "hundreds of pages of e-mails and internal documents" showed "how Christie loyalists inside the PA worked to orchestrate a cover-up after traffic mayhem" in Fort Lee. In September, as more reporters began asking about the GW Bridge problems, officials conferred on how to respond.&lt;ref name="Rucker"&gt;{{cite news |first1= Philip |last1= Rucker |first2= Aaron |last2= Blake |lastauthoramp= yes |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/new-nj-documents-show-extensive-coverup-in-fort-lee-traffic-shutdown/2014/01/10/09af4efc-7a1f-11e3-af7f-13bf0e9965f6_story.html |title= New NJ documents show extensive coverup in Fort Lee traffic shutdown |work= The Washington Post |date= January 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 13, ''The Record'' reported the outrage commuters were expressing toward the PA following days of long, inbound delays, and Fort Lee officials' unsuccessful efforts to get an explanation.&lt;ref name="Cichowski-2013-09-13"/&gt; Then on September 16, a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reporter asked PA spokesman Coleman about what had occurred after some ''Journal'' editors had been in traffic the previous week. "Coleman passed the query up the chain of command" and Wildstein forwarded it to Baroni, commenting "I call bullshit on this." Further inquiries were directed by Coleman to Baroni and Wildstein, asking how they wanted the PA to respond, and Wildstein forwarded one of these inquiries to Christie's press secretary and chief spokesman, [[Michael Drewniak]]. Coleman also wrote to Baroni and Wildstein, "I will not respond unless instructed to do so."&lt;ref name="Rucker"/&gt;

On September 17, Wildstein informed Baroni that he had received a call from ''Wall Street Journal'' reporter Tedd Mann. "Jesus", Baroni replied, "Call Drewniak".&lt;ref name="Record Timeline"&gt;{{cite news |author= Staff |url= http://www.northjersey.com/news/Timeline_of_events_around_GWB_lane-closure_controversy.html#sthash.vza8NYRY.dpuf |title= Timeline of events around GWB lane-closure controversy |work= [[The Record (Bergen County)]] |location= Woodland Park, NJ |accessdate= January 14, 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140114081336/http://www.northjersey.com/news/Timeline_of_events_around_GWB_lane-closure_controversy.html#sthash.vza8NYRY.dpuf |archivedate= January 14, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The e-mails showed efforts by Christie appointees in the PA and his office in Trenton to respond to the aftermath and media inquiries for the toll lane closures. The participants included Baroni, Wildstein, and PA Chairman Samson, as well as Drewniak and Maria Comella, Communications Director. In a September 18 e-mail, Samson warned that Foye is "playing in traffic, made a big mistake" in response to a leak to ''The Wall Street Journal'' for their September 17 story citing unnamed PA officials as saying the decision to close the toll lanes had caused tensions within the bi-state agency.&lt;ref name=samsonblasting/&gt;&lt;ref name="hide political motives"&gt;{{cite news|first1=March|last1=Santora|first2=Kate|last2=Zernikej |lastauthoramp= yes |title=Bridge Scandal Documents Indicate Effort to Hide Political Motive|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/11/nyregion/hundreds-of-pages-on-bridge-scandal-released.html?hp|accessdate=January 10, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=January 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other communications, officials used an ethnic [[pejorative]] to refer to the Fort Lee mayor. In an e-mail from Wildstein responding to [[Bill Stepien]], he said "It will be a tough November for this little Serbian", derogatorily referring to Sokolich, who is [[Croatian-American]].&lt;ref name="Christie bridge scandal deepens"&gt;{{cite news |first= Elias |last= Isquith |url= http://www.salon.com/2014/01/08/emails_show_christie_aides_planning_gwb_gridlock/ |title= Christie bridge scandal deepens |work= Salon |date= January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baroni referred to "Serbia" in text messages in another apparent reference to Mayor Sokolich.&lt;ref name="Chris Christie's Traffic Problems"&gt;{{cite news |first= Amy |last= Davison |url= http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2014/01/chris-christie-george-washington-bridge-fort-lee-mayor-sokolich.html |title= Chris Christie's Traffic Problems |work= The New Yorker |date= January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lebanondemocrat.com"&gt;{{cite news |first1= Andrew |last1= Seidman |first2= Maddie |last2= Hanna |lastauthoramp= yes |url= http://www.lebanondemocrat.com/article/national-news/319431 |title= Emails seen as revealing plan for retribution against N.J. mayor's non-support for Christie re-election |work= [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date= January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sokolich told ''[[The Huffington Post]]'': "That slight is offensive to me, and it's offensive to me of everyone of [[Serbian people|Serbian]] background.

On October 9, Philippe Danielides, a senior adviser to Samson, e-mailed Wildstein a daily news summary and asked "Has any thought been given to writing an [[op-ed]] or providing a statement about the GWB study? Or is the plan just to hunker down and grit our way through it?" Wildstein replied "Yes and yes" and forwarded these e-mails to Baroni.&lt;ref name="Rucker"/&gt;
Wildstein sought advice from Drewniak, with the two meeting in person on December 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Foster|first=David|title=Gov.

At a December 13 press conference, Christie announced the immediate resignations of Baroni and Wildstein.&lt;ref name="Record Timeline"/&gt;

==David Samson allegations==
{{Main|David Samson (lawyer)#Controversies}}
In the wake of the lane closings, the Port Authority's chairman David Samson was the subject of media reports alleging ethical violations and conflicts of interest. It was alleged that Samson's law firm and their clients profited from dealings with the Port Authority and from projects involving New Jersey government financing or tax incentives. It was also reported that Christie benefited politically and his allies benefited financially during Samson's term as chairman.&lt;ref name="Buettner 3-4-14"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/nyregion/in-job-appointee-profits-and-christie-gains-power.html?_r=0 | title=In Job, Appointee Profits and Christie Gains Power | work=The New York Times | date=March 4, 2014 | accessdate=March 9, 2014 | author=Buettner, Russ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Foye, the Port Authority's executive director, asserted that Samson lacked the moral authority to run the agency.&lt;ref name="Foye: Samson lacks moral authority"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baxter|first=Christopher|title=David Samson lacks moral authority to run Port Authority, top official says|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/02/david_samson_lacks_moral_authority_to_run_port_authority_top_official_says.html|work=The Star-Ledger |location= Newark, NJ |accessdate=February 26, 2014|date=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The May 2015 indictments of Wildstein, Baroni and Kelly contend that the lane closures were political retribution against Fort Lee Mayor [[Mark Sokolich]], a Democrat, for not supporting Christie in the [[New Jersey gubernatorial election, 2013|2013 New Jersey gubernatorial election]].&lt;ref name="Indictment details - Times - May 2, 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zernike|first1=Kate|title=U.S. Indictment Details Plotting in New Jersey Bridge Scandal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/02/nyregion/us-indictment-details-plotting-in-new-jersey-bridge-scandal.html|accessdate=2 May 2015|work=The New York Times|date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sokolich initially claimed that he was asked for an endorsement once, in the spring of 2013, months before the August "time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee" e-mail by Bridget Kelly to David Wildstein.&lt;ref name=Zernike/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/13/nyregion/a-bridge-to-scandal-behind-the-fort-lee-ruse.html |title= A Bridge to Scandal: Behind the Fort Lee Ruse |first= N. R. |last= Kleinfieldjan |date= January 12, 2014 |work= The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the two men are from different parties and an endorsement would normally not be expected, Christie ran on a platform of bipartisanship and had secured the endorsement of many other Democratic officials.&lt;ref name=Zernike/&gt;

In an interview on February 6, 2014, with ''The Record'', Sokolich said that the Christie administration had courted his endorsement over a period of time going back to around 2010, when Christie invited Sokolich and a handful of other mayors, including Hoboken's Dawn Zimmer, to have lunch at the governor's mansion in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]. Christie was shown in a picture talking with local mayors in a lineup, including Sokolich, after a news conference in Teaneck on December 8, 2011. In 2012, Sokolich and his cousins were given a personal tour of the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum|9/11 Memorial Plaza]] by Wildstein, who repeatedly told Sokolich, "I've been told to be nice to you." Matt Mowers, regional political director for Christie's re-election campaign, who had previously worked in the governor's intergovernmental affairs office, met with Sokolich regularly in 2013 and told him about other Democrats who endorsed Christie for governor. On at least three occasions, Sokolich noted that Mowers brought up the subject of Sokolich's possible endorsement. Sokolich eventually supported [[Barbara Buono]], Christie's Democratic opponent in the 2013 election.&lt;ref name="Sokolich Feb 6, 2014 interview"&gt;{{cite news |last= Kelly |first= Mike |url= http://www.northjersey.com/news/state/Fort_Lee_mayor_now_says_Christie_campaign_courted_him_for_endorsement.html |title= GWB scandal: Fort Lee mayor now says Christie campaign courted him for endorsement |work= The Record |location= Woodland Park, NJ |date= February 8, 2014 |accessdate= February 9, 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140209020539/http://www.northjersey.com/news/state/Fort_Lee_mayor_now_says_Christie_campaign_courted_him_for_endorsement.html |archivedate= February 9, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christie said at his January 9, 2014, press conference that Sokolich was "never on my radar screen" and that he would not "have been able to pick him [Sokolich] out of a lineup."&lt;ref name="Press transcript Jan. 9 2014"/&gt;

E-mails indicated that Wildstein and Baroni were aware the closures would harm Sokolich. In an e-mail from Wildstein responding to Bill Stepien,&lt;ref name="Published: January 10, 2014 6:38 PM"/&gt; Wildstein wrote "It will be a tough November for this little Serbian", derogatorily referring to Sokolich, who is [[Croatian-American]].&lt;ref name="Christie bridge scandal deepens"/&gt; Baroni referred to "Serbia" in text messages in another apparent reference to mayor Sokolich.&lt;ref name="Chris Christie's Traffic Problems"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lebanondemocrat.com"/&gt;

The May 2015 indictment, citing text messages between Wildstein, Baroni and Kelly, contended that the lane closures were designed to have maximum impact upon motorists and the city of Fort Lee. The closures targeted the first day of school, and deliberately steered cars to the cash lane, so as to maximize traffic disruption in the surrounding areas. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that "the three plotting like petulant and juvenile pranksters, using government resources, time and personnel to punish a public official whose sole offense was failing to endorse their political patron. The three were in constant contact, brazenly using government e-mails, their tone sometimes almost giddy. They even gave the increasingly desperate mayor of Fort Lee their own version of the silent treatment."&lt;ref name="Indictment details - Times - May 2, 2015"/&gt;

Wildstein responded: "Radio silence. His name comes right after Mayor Fulop."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Investigations==
According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the e-mails discussing the lane closure "could represent evidence that government resources were used for political purposes, a potential crime".&lt;ref name=Zernike/&gt; According to legal experts, federal prosecutors also could "examine whether the obstruction of interstate commerce on the bridge between New Jersey and New York" violated federal law, and either federal or [[New Jersey Attorney General|state prosecutors]] also might "build a cover-up case, rather than one based on the traffic tie-ups themselves".&lt;ref name="Voreacos"&gt;{{cite news|first1=David |last1=Voreacos |first2=Erik |last2=Larson |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/bloomberg/article/Christie-Bridge-Scandal-Prosecutions-Seen-Built-5133519.php |title=Christie Bridge Scandal Prosecutions Seen Built on Cover-Up |work=Bloomberg News |date=January 10, 2014 |accessdate=February 16, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114145340/http://www.sfgate.com/business/bloomberg/article/Christie-Bridge-Scandal-Prosecutions-Seen-Built-5133519.php |archivedate=January 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 2014, [[Alan Zegas]], Wildstein's attorney, said that his client would offer to shed light on the scandal on the condition that he was given [[immunity from prosecution]] from the relevant federal and state law enforcement agencies. There had not been any offer of immunity from the office of the [[United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.aol.com/article/2014/01/17/david-wildstein-player-in-nj-bridge-scandal-will-talk-for-immu/20810194/?icid=maing-grid7&amp;#124;main5&amp;#124;dl22&amp;#124;sec1_lnk2%26pLid%3D431534 |title= David Wildstein, player in NJ bridge scandal, will talk for immunity |publisher= AOL |date= January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A joint legislative committee, New Jersey Legislative Select Committee on Investigation, was created on January 27, 2014, to take over the original investigation by the Assembly Transportation Committee.&lt;ref name="Joint committee to investigate"&gt;{{cite news|first=Heather|last=Haddon|title=Joint Committee to Investigate Bridge Lane Closure Controversy|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/01/27/joint-committee-to-investigate-bridge-lane-closure-controversy|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 27, 2014|accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assembly Transportation Committee investigation===
On October 2, 2013, Assemblyman [[John Wisniewski]] (D-Middlesex), said that he would open an investigation with the Assembly Transportation Committee to determine whether or not the lane closures were politically motivated.&lt;ref name="Updated timeline"/&gt;

The first hearing was held on November 25, 2013, for which [[Bill Baroni]] attended on behalf of the PA. Baroni, who was not [[Sworn testimony|sworn in to testify under oath]], said that David Wildstein had ordered a study to determine if closing two of the Fort Lee toll lanes, and assigning them to mainline traffic, would shorten delays for commuters from other parts of New Jersey. Baroni argued that it was unfair that Fort Lee drivers occupied three out of the 12 lanes on the upper level, despite being only 4.5% of all traffic. Committee members pointed out that 4.5% was based on the number of [[E-ZPass]] users from Fort Lee that use all approaches to the bridge, and that vehicles from many other towns, besides Fort Lee, use that Fort Lee entrance. He admitted the actual percentage of vehicles, which utilize that Fort Lee entrance, could be higher than 4.5% of overall traffic, and also failed to mention that there are actually 29 operating toll lanes for the bridge when comparing the three dedicated toll lanes for this entrance.&lt;ref name="NJ Transportation Committee, Nov. 25, 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Assembly Transportation, Public Works and Independent Authorities Committee (List of Hearings)|date=November 25, 2013|url=http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/media/archive_audio2.asp?KEY=ATR&amp;SESSION=2012|publisher=New Jersey Legislature|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Phillis|title=Port Authority breaks silence on George Washington Bridge delays|date=November 25, 2013|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/Port_Authoritys_Baroni_GWB_lane_closures_were_for_traffic_study.html|work=The Record|location=Woodland Park, NJ|accessdate=January 11, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110222241/http://www.northjersey.com/news/Port_Authoritys_Baroni_GWB_lane_closures_were_for_traffic_study.html|archivedate=January 10, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Redacted Document from Wildstein.pdf|thumb|upright|right|Wildstein turned over heavily redacted documents in response to the subpoena.]]

Baroni said that with the reduction in Fort Lee toll lanes, traffic data showed that the mainline traffic travel times in the express lanes' approach to the bridge were about four minutes faster on two days. He apologized for what he acknowledged was the agency's failure to properly communicate with local officials and the public in advance of this project.&lt;ref name="NJ Transportation Committee, Nov. 25, 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/372710-official-blames-study-for-nyc-bridge-lanes-closure|title=Official Blames Study for NYC Washington Bridge Lanes Closure|work=The Epoch Times|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the hearing, Wisniewski called the closures at best "clumsy and ham-handed" and at worst "political mischief by a political appointee and another political appointee that they did not make available for testimony", referring to Wildstein's non-attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baroni: GWB Lane Closures Were for Traffic Study|date=November 25, 2013|url=http://nj1015.com/baroni-gwb-lane-closures-were-for-traffic-study|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after Baroni made his presentation, a text exchange occurred, according to subpoenaed documents from Wildstein. Wildstein said "you did great" and said that the "Trenton feedback" was good.&lt;ref name="Christie not in the clear"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kroll|first1=Andy|last2=Corn|first2=David |lastauthoramp= yes |title=Chris Christie's Not in the Clear Yet.

Sen. [[Kevin J. O'Toole|Kevin O'Toole]] released a statement that day to the media, echoing various talking points from Baroni's presentation. All of this suggested that O'Toole had prior communications with Wildstein and possibly Baroni.&lt;ref name="Editorial - continue probe without O'Toole"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bridge scandal probe should continue without key Republican: Editorial|url=http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/02/bridge_scandal_probe_should_continue_without_otoole_editorial.html|accessdate=February 21, 2014|work=The Star-Ledger |location= Newark, NJ |date=February 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Had the Port Authority simply complied with the requests, there probably wouldn't have been a rationale for the committee to get subpoena power," Wisniewski later said.&lt;ref name="Porter-2016-08-29"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Porter|first1=David|title=In Varied Ways, Costs of New Jersey Bridge Scandal Add Up|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/George-Washington-Bridge-Costs-391541291.html|accessdate=September 26, 2016|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Durando, George Washington Bridge manager, said that he feared retaliation if he did not follow Wildstein's orders to close two toll lanes to local traffic and not notify local officials or the public about these changes. Durando and Cedrick Fulton, director of tunnels, bridges, and terminals, both said that they were personally told by Wildstein that he would notify Foye of the change.&lt;ref name=Durando/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ted|last=Mann|title=Port Authority Chief Testifies in George Washington Bridge Flap|date=December 9, 2013|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304014504579248642121531588|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foye said that he was unaware of any traffic study until he ordered its termination on September 13, 2013, and blamed Wildstein for the toll lane changes, while believing Baroni was involved in the planning.&lt;ref name="NJ Assembly Hearing Report, Dec 9, 2013"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://dspace.njstatelib.org/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10929/30031/b8512013a.pdf|title=Committee Meeting of Assembly Transportation, Public Works and Independent Authorities Committee (transcript)|publisher=[[New Jersey State Library]]|date=December 9, 2013|format=PDF|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Aron|title=Port Authority Officials Testify Before Assembly Transportation Committee|date=December 9, 2013|url=http://www.njtvonline.org/news/video/port-authority-officials-testify-before-assembly-transportation-committee|publisher=NJTV|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Wildstein called Fulton on September 6, 2013, to inform him that the lane closures would begin on September 9, Fulton explained that he thought that was unusual since planning for traffic disruptions on major facilities typically starts years in advance.

===Special legislative investigative committees===
On January 16, 2014, the New Jersey Assembly and Senate each created committees to take over the investigation from the Assembly Transportation Committee. The Assembly committee hired Reid Schar as special counsel, who would assist in the investigation. He is a former assistant U.S. attorney from Illinois who assisted in the prosecution of former [[Governor of Illinois|Illinois Governor]] [[Rod Blagojevich]].&lt;ref name="Christie Hiring"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Broader investigation"&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Costa|title=Broader investigation of N.J. bridge closures launched|date=January 13, 2014|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/01/13/special-investigation-of-n-j-bridge-closures-launched|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Jersey Assembly re-authorized the legislative subpoena powers, which were immediately used to subpoena two organizations and 18 individuals in Christie's administration, the governor's office, his 2013 election campaign, and the Port Authority, but not Christie himself. Those receiving subpoenas were instructed to submit by February 3, 2014, all documents and communications, going back to September 1, 2012, related to the reassignment of the two toll lanes during the week of September 9, 2013, and any attempts to conceal the activities or reasons related to that incident.&lt;ref name="Twenty subpoenas"&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Reitmeyer|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/Breaking_news_Supoenas_released_in_GWB_scandal.html|title=Christie GWB scandal: Names of 18 served with subpoenas|work=The Record|location=Woodland Park, NJ|date=January 17, 2014|accessdate=January 17, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119000153/http://www.northjersey.com/news/Breaking_news_Supoenas_released_in_GWB_scandal.html|archivedate=January 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2014, the members of the bi-partisan committee were announced, consisting of eight Assembly representatives (five Democrats and three Republicans), and four Senators (three Democrats and one Republican). At the time, 40% of the members of the New Jersey Legislature were Republican. Besides the two Democratic co-chairs, members included Assemblywoman [[Marlene Caride]] (D-Bergen), Assemblyman [[Michael Patrick Carroll]] (R-Morris), Senator [[Nia Gill]] (D-Essex), Senator [[Linda Greenstein]] (D-Middlesex), Assembly Majority Leader [[Louis Greenwald]] (D-Camden), Assemblywoman [[Amy Handlin]] (R-Monmouth), Assemblywoman [[Valerie Huttle]] (D-Bergen), Assemblywoman [[Holly Schepisi]] (R-Bergen), Assemblywoman [[Bonnie Watson Coleman]] (D-Mercer), and an unnamed Republican Senator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Brent|title=Bridge scandal: Members of NJ investigative committee are announced|work=The Star-Ledger |location= Newark, NJ |date=January 24, 2014|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/01/bridge_scandal_members_of_nj_investigative_committee_are_announced.html| accessdate = January 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 27, both houses voted unanimously to combine the investigations, maintaining the partisan balance, and announced Senator [[Kevin J.

As a precautionary move, the new investigative committee re-issued subpoenas that had been sent earlier, with the requested records still due on the original deadline, February 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baxter|first=Christopher|title=Bridge scandal subpoenas will be reissued by new joint NJ Legislature investigatory panel|work=The Star-Ledger |location= Newark, NJ |date=January 27, 2014|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/01/nj_legislature_forms_new_panel_to_investigation_george_washington_bridge_scandal.html|accessdate=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a January 31, 2014, letter to Reid Schar, general counsel for the legislative committee, Kevin Marino, the attorney for Stepien, said that he would not submit anything in response to their subpoena and requested its withdrawal, citing his client's [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment right]] and New Jersey [[common law]] privileges against self-incrimination, with regard to the criminal inquiry underway by the U.S. Attorney, and [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] and [[Constitution of New Jersey#"Rights and Privileges"|New Jersey Constitution (Article I, paragraph 7)]] rights against unreasonable [[search and seizure]]. Wisniewski said the subpoena was perfectly sound, and that Schar would review the attorney's objections and consider the committee's legal options.&lt;ref name="Stepien lawyer objects"&gt;{{cite news |last= Grant |first= Jason |title= Bill Stepien's lawyer objects to legislative subpoena in bridge scandal, requests its withdrawal |work= The Star-Ledger |location= Newark, NJ  |date= January 31, 2014 |url= http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/01/bill_stepiens_lawyer_objects_to_legislative_subpoena_in_bridge_scandal_request_subpeona_withdraw.html |accessdate= February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stepien lawyer invokes fifth"&gt;{{cite news | title = Attorney says longtime Christie adviser Bill Stepien will invoke Fifth Amendment |work= The Washington Post | date = January 31, 2014 | url = https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/politics/letter-from-attorney-of-longtime-christie-adviser-bill-stepien-invoking-fifth-amendment/790/ | accessdate=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Critchley, the attorney for Kelly, submitted a letter that his client would not comply with the subpoena based on similar claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grant|first=Jason|title=Bridge scandal: Bridget Kelly refuses to turn over documents subpoenaed by legislative committee|work=The Star-Ledger |location= Newark, NJ |date=February 3, 2014|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/02/bridge_scandal_bridget_kelly_objects_to_legislative_subpeona_refuses_to_turn_over_documents.html|accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 3, 2014, Wisniewski and Weinberg issued a statement, without details, that some responses to subpoenas had been received and that extensions for submissions had been granted to others. Mark Sheridan, an attorney for Christie's campaign organization, said it had been granted an extension while it awaited an opinion from the state [[New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission|Election Law Enforcement Commission]], which on February 11 allowed the campaign to use existing funds and raise funds to pay its legal bills in response to the NJ Legislature and federal subpoenas for general evidence.

On February 10, 2014, the committee voted to reject the objections raised by the lawyers of Stepien and Kelly to not comply with the subpoenas for their records, and to compel Stepien and Kelly to produce all related documents, instructing special counsel Reid Schar to "take all necessary steps" to enforce the subpoenas. All four Republicans abstained in the vote.

On the same day, the committee announced it was issuing 18 new subpoenas to individuals within the governor's office and the Port Authority that also included new recipients, as well as the governor's office itself and Christie's 2013 re-election campaign. The new recipients included assistants to Foye, Wildstein, Baroni, and Kelly. Other new PA recipients included Christie referral, [[Philip Kwon]], deputy general counsel, Christie appointee [[Pat Schuber|William "Pat" Schuber]], a commissioner, who had served in a variety of local, county, and state elected positions in New Jersey, and Steve Coleman, deputy director of media relations.&lt;ref name="Who's who - 18 new subpoenas"&gt;{{cite news|last=Frumin|first=Aliyah|title=Lawmakers probing Bridgegate' serve 18 new subpoenas: Who's who|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-18-new-bridgegate-subpoenas-whos-who|accessdate=February 13, 2014|publisher=MSNBC|date=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SLfeb10&gt;{{cite news|last=Baxter|first=Christopher|title=Christie bridge scandal: Recipients of 18 new subpoenas revealed|work=The Star-Ledger |location= Newark, NJ |date=February 10, 2014|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/02/christie_bridge_scandal_nj_committee_issues_more_subpoenas.html|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the subpoenas was sent to the [[New Jersey State Police]] aviation unit for flight information records when Christie used a state helicopter during the toll lane closings.

The subpoenas sought information for records from staff at the PA and the governor's office related to preparations for Baroni's presentation to the Assembly Transportation Committee's November 25, 2013, hearing.&lt;ref name="Feb 10 2013 subpoenas, ARC tunnel and more"/&gt; Wildstein's attorney had claimed that Wildstein was present during some of the times when Kwon, who attended the committee hearing, helped prepare Baroni over several days for his presentation about a traffic study and other issues related to the local toll lane closures. A PA spokesman said: "Meeting with a witness prior to testimony is a routine function of any lawyer and any attempt to assign ulterior motives to this general practice is unwarranted." Kwon served as first assistant attorney general during Christie's first term as governor and previously worked for him in the U.S. Attorney General's office in New Jersey. He was also Christie's 2012 [[Supreme Court of New Jersey|Supreme Court]] justice nominee, who was blocked by Democratic state legislative members.&lt;ref name="Kwon preps Baroni"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mann|first=Ted|title=Christie Ally Prepped Official Before George Washington Bridge Lane Closure Testimony; Philip Kwon, an Attorney at the PA, Helped to Prepare Bill Baroni|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=February 3, 2014|url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB10001424052702303442704579359122606230960.html|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the subpoenas sought documents from the PANYNJ related to toll increases for the tunnels and bridges and Christie's 2010 decision to cancel the [[Access to the Region's Core]] project, specifically with regard to projected cost overruns. It also requested the names of job candidates sent by Christie's office to the agency.&lt;ref name="Feb 10 2013 subpoenas, ARC tunnel and more"&gt;{{cite news|last=Baxter|first=Christopher|title=New bridge scandal subpoenas seek records related to Chris Christie, ARC tunnel and more|work=The Star-Ledger |location= Newark, NJ |date=February 12, 2014|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/02/bridge_scandal_panel_digs_deeper_into_traffic_study_claims_possible_ties_to_chris_christies_office.html|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 19, 2014, it was reported that the co-chairs said that the committee would need to question Senator O'Toole about what he knew, including any communications with Baroni and/or Wildstein, prior to Baroni's November 25 presentation to the Assembly Transportation Committee. A previously redacted November 25 text message from Wildstein to Baroni said that O'Toole was ready with a statement, which was issued to the media, that echoed talking points from Baroni's same day presentation and attacked the Democrats investigating these issues. O'Toole followed up with an editorial in ''The Record'' that elaborated on these talking points and attacks. It raised further questions on whether O'Toole should continue to serve on the committee.&lt;ref name="O'Toole in redacted text message"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Editorial - continue probe without O'Toole"/&gt;

On February 28, 2014, Bonnie Watson Coleman withdrew from the committee, a day after she called on Christie to resign as governor due to the culture of bullying she says was fostered under him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Isherwood|first=Darryl|title=Watson Coleman steps down from bridgegate investigation committee after calling for Gov.

On March 31, 2014, Wisniewski announced the intention to subpoena notes, records, and interviews from the inquiry conducted for the governor's office by Randy Mastro of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, since they had not been made available to the committee. Wisniewski said that there would be questions about the objectivity and independence of that investigation if subpoenaed items were withheld. In response, Mastro released a statement saying that the governor's office did not release interview transcripts because of its cooperation with the U.S. Attorney's Office's investigation and would respond to any subpoena request, when received. These matters could go to court if the governor's office tried to exercise any rights not to provide subpoenaed items.&lt;ref name="Wisnewski to subpoena Mastro"&gt;{{cite news|last=Baxter|first=Christopher|title=Bridge scandal panel to subpoena records of Christie internal review|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/03/bridge_scandal_panel_to_subpoena_records_of_christie_internal_review.html|accessdate=March 31, 2014|newspaper=The Star-Ledger|date=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Santi-2014-03-31&gt;{{cite news|last=Delli Santi|first=Angela|title=Christie's bridge scandal lawyers to be subpoenaed|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=151&amp;sid=29286800&amp;title=christies-bridge-scandal-lawyers-to-be-subpoenaed|accessdate=March 31, 2014|agency=Associated Press|publisher=KSL|date=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 11, 2014, the committee received the list of 75 persons interviewed by Mastro's team.&lt;ref name=Hayes-2014-04-11&gt;{{cite news|last=Hayes|first=Melissa|title=GWB legislative panel knows identities of 75 interviewed in Christie's internal probe|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/gwb-legislative-panel-knows-identities-of-75-interviewed-in-christie-s-internal-probe-1.917934|accessdate=April 11, 2014|newspaper=The Record|date=April 11, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413144703/http://www.northjersey.com/news/gwb-legislative-panel-knows-identities-of-75-interviewed-in-christie-s-internal-probe-1.917934|archivedate=April 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baxter-2014-04-11&gt;{{cite news|last=Baxter|first=Christopher|title=Bridge scandal panel gets list of 75 people interviewed as part of Christie's review|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/04/bridge_scandal_panel_gets_list_of_75_people_interviewed_as_part_of_christies_review.html|accessdate=April 11, 2014|newspaper=The Star-Ledger|date=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wisniewski said that he expected all existing interview materials in "whatever form", or the committee would issue a subpoena.&lt;ref name="Baxter-2014-04-11"/&gt; The interview notes, marked "privileged and confidential attorney opinion work product", were turned over to the legislative committee and U.S. Attorney's Office, and publicly released online on April 14, without a subpoena.

On April 9, 2014, the committee's investigation was dealt a setback when New Jersey Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson ruled that Stepien and Kelly do not have to hand over subpoenaed documents since the subpoenas were written too broadly, like a "[[fishing expedition]]".&lt;ref name=Boburg-2014-04-09&gt;{{cite news|last=Boburg|first=Shawn|title=Judge: Christie ex-aides Kelly, Stepien can withhold documents in GWB probe|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/judge-christie-ex-aides-kelly-stepien-can-withhold-documents-in-gwb-probe-1.877447?page=all|accessdate=April 9, 2014|newspaper=The Record|date=April 9, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413140405/http://www.northjersey.com/news/judge-christie-ex-aides-kelly-stepien-can-withhold-documents-in-gwb-probe-1.877447?page=all|archivedate=April 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zernike-2014-04-09&gt;{{cite news|last=Zernike|first=Kate|title=Christie Aides Don't Have to Turn Over Bridge Scandal Documents, Judge Rules|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/nyregion/christie-aides-dont-have-to-turn-over-bridge-scandal-documents-judge-rules.html|accessdate=April 9, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge also said that the subpoenas, as written, "clearly violate" federal and state protections against self-incrimination and unlawful search and seizure.&lt;ref name=Zernike-2014-04-09/&gt; The ruling said that Kelly and Stepien could assert their Fifth Amendment rights because of the investigation by the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey, and these documents could provide a "link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a federal crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baxter|first=Christopher|title=NJ judge rules against bridge scandal panel in subpoena fight|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/04/nj_judge_rules_against_bridge_scandal_panel_in_subpoena_fight.html|accessdate=April 10, 2014|date=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The judge suggested that the committee could consider reissuing subpoenas with more limited document requests that could be acceptable. Legal experts agreed with that approach, and also suggested that electronic copies of the original subpoenaed documents could be obtained through subpoenas of [[Server (computing)|system servers]] that store those documents since individuals do not have any personal right to bar the subpoena of a server.&lt;ref name=Boburg-2014-04-09/&gt;

The judge also expressed reservations about having jurisdictional powers to compel the turnover of subpoenaed documents since "the committee has the power to enforce its own subpoenas through orders to compel and grant immunity in return." The lawyers for Stepien and Kelly have contended that the committee could grant their clients immunity from criminal prosecution in exchange for the documents.

===U.S. Senate inquiry===
[[File:Jay Rockefeller official photo.jpg|thumb|upright|Senator [[Jay Rockefeller]]]]
The [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation]] had opened its own inquiry into the closure. Committee chairman [[Jay Rockefeller]] (D-[[West Virginia]]) had written Samson and Vice Chairman Scott Rechler in December 2013 to demand answers about how the Port Authority handled the closure and its aftermath. According to his letter, Rockefeller, who has long been critical about shortcomings in the PA's operations, was concerned about what seemed to be evidence of "political appointees abusing their power to hamper interstate commerce and safety without public notice." It also said that based on a review of recent testimony before the New Jersey Assembly Transportation Committee, it appeared that there was no traffic study underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/01/gwb_samson_responds_senate_inquiry.html|title=Port Authority answers questions posed by U.S. Senate committee|last=Strunsky|first=Steve|work=The Star-Ledger |location= Newark, NJ |date=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/?a=Files.Serve&amp;File_id=3261919c-bda9-4644-8d70-80aeba8da8be Letter from Rockefeller to Port Authority]&lt;/ref&gt; Rockefeller also asked the [[United States Department of Transportation]] to conduct its own review of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/?a=Files.Serve&amp;File_id=e94a4557-d3ab-4190-8139-af062563125a Letter from Rockefeller to USDOT regarding lane closures]&lt;/ref&gt;

The PA's written response to Rockefeller's questions, signed by board secretary Karen Eastman, restated and summarized the December 9, 2013, testimony by Foye and two other PA managers before the Assembly Transportation Committee. It said that the closures had been ordered by Wildstein on September 6, 2013, despite various PA engineers expressing their concerns, particularly about more traffic congestion on local streets and no advance notice to Fort Lee officials. Wildstein, the letter said, had ordered bridge officials not to notify Foye of the closures. It also revealed that the PA's board had not approved Baroni's November 25 presentation before that committee, that the closures were part of a traffic study. It showed that PA's procedures for planning and internal notifications for any traffic study were not followed. However, the letter did not reveal any reason why the closures were ordered.

The lane-closure scandal also sparked inquiries by the [[New York County District Attorney|Manhattan District Attorney]]'s office and the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]. The SEC and Manhattan DA probes are focusing on the [[Pulaski Skyway]], an elevated highway linking Newark and Jersey City. On June 23, 2014, ''The New York Times'' reported that the inquiries are focusing on possible securities law violations caused by Christie's use of Port Authority funds to pay for repairs to the Skyway in 2010 and 2011, using money that was to be used on a new Hudson River rail tunnel that Christie canceled in October 2010.&lt;ref name="Times - probe - 6-24-14"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flegenheimer|first1=Matt|last2=Rashbaum|first2=William K.|last3=Zernike|first3=Kate|title=2nd Bridge Inquiry Said to Be Linked to Christie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/24/nyregion/2nd-bridge-inquiry-said-to-be-linked-to-christie.html?_r=0|accessdate=June 24, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Indictments and trial}} Indictments and trial of Baroni and Kelly ==

On May 1, 2015, the U.S. Attorney unsealed indictments, charging [[Bill Baroni]] and [[Bridget Anne Kelly]] with nine counts of conspiracy, fraud and related charges.  These included conspiracy to commit fraud by "knowingly converting and intentionally misapplying property of an organization receiving federal benefits".  That same day, prosecutors released [[David Wildstein]]'s [[Plea bargaining in the United States|plea bargain]].  He had agreed in January to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy against civil rights.&lt;ref name="nyt indictments"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/02/nyregion/christie-ally-expected-to-plead-guilty-in-george-washington-bridge-lane-closing-case.html?_r=0|title=2 Indicted in George Washington Bridge Case; Ally of Christie Pleads Guilty|date=May 1, 2015|work=The New York Times|last2=Santora|first2=Marc|accessdate=2015-05-01|last1=Zernike|first1=Kate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildstein, whose sentencing was delayed until after the trial, agreed to testify against Baroni and Kelly.&lt;ref name="Boburg-2015-08-06"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/gwb-probe-sentencing-for-david-wildstein-delayed-until-january-1.1387932|title=GWB probe: Sentencing for David Wildstein delayed until January|date=August 6, 2015|work=The Record|last1=Boburg|first1=Shawn|accessdate=August 6, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150808232823/http://www.northjersey.com/news/gwb-probe-sentencing-for-david-wildstein-delayed-until-january-1.1387932|archivedate=August 8, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indictments charge that the lane closures were retribution against Sokolich for not endorsing Christie. Fishman said that Wildstein had corroborated the allegations in the indictments,&lt;ref name="nyt indictments" /&gt; and said that the three officials "agreed to and did use public resources to carry out a vendetta and exact retribution," and that they "callously victimized the people of Fort Lee."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/01/politics/chris-christie-bridgegate-investigation-charges/index.html|title=Bridgegate: 1 guilty plea, 2 indictments and 'liars'|date=1 May 2015|work=CNN.com|last2=Jaffe|first2=Alexandra|ref=CNN.com - indictments - May 2015|last3=Frates|first3=Chris|last1=Diamond|first1=Jeremy|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly vigorously denied wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="CNN-Kelly-May 2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/01/politics/bridget-kelly-breaks-silence-david-wildstein-liar/|title=Ex-Christie aide breaks silence, lashes out over Bridgegate|date=1 May 2015|work=CNN.com|last1=Diamond|first1=Jeremy|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baroni argued that his indictment was improperly based on the unsworn testimony and documents he had provided to the legislative committee in 2014, but prosecutors countered that he had not been offered immunity at that time.&lt;ref name="Berger-2016-04-26"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/battle-continues-over-documents-in-gwb-lane-closing-case-1.1553020|title=Battle continues over documents in GWB lane-closing case|date=April 26, 2016|work=The Record|last1=Berger|first1=Paul|accessdate=April 26, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427111356/http://www.northjersey.com/news/battle-continues-over-documents-in-gwb-lane-closing-case-1.1553020|archivedate=April 27, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those news organizations together asked the court to release the prosecution's list of unindicted co-conspirators. On February 17, 2016, U.S. Attorney [[Paul J. Fishman]]'s office filed a brief to Wigenton requesting that the Bridgegate records remain sealed so that the list of uncharged third-party co-conspirators not be made public. Coconspirators refers to "individuals the government believes may have known about the plot to abruptly shut down access lanes to the bridge to cause massive traffic disruptions, but were not charged."&lt;ref name="nj_feb_2016_sealed_records" /&gt; Fishman claimed that it was a policy of the United States Department of Justice "to avoid unnecessary public references to wrongdoing" by unindicted co-conspirator because they have no "evidentiary value" in the criminal matter. If the names were made public, then public employees or appointed officials, who were said to be involved in the lane closures, would not have the "opportunity to challenge that information in court."&lt;ref name="AP_bridgegate_17_feb_2016" /&gt; Their names would be revealed if they were relevant at a future trial or if the Government "moves for the admission of an out-of-court statement made in furtherance of the conspiracy by an unindicted coconspirator."&lt;ref name="AP_bridgegate_17_feb_2016" /&gt;

In its [[opening statement]] on September 19, 2016, the prosecution said that at the World Trade Center site on the third day of the closure, "the evidence will show that [Wildstein and Baroni] bragged [to Christie] about the fact that there were traffic problems in Fort Lee, and that Mayor Sokolich was not getting his calls returned," and that Wildstein would testify and "admit that he was the one who came up with that idea."&lt;ref name="Sherman-Arco-2016-09-19"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2016/09/bridgegate_trial_starts.html|title=Bridgegate prosecutors: Wildstein to testify he told Christie of lane closings|date=September 19, 2016|publisher=NJ Advance Media|last2=Arco|first2=Matt|last1=Sherman|first1=Ted|accessdate=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of a month, prosecutors presented their case. David Wildstein appeared in week two, giving over eight days of testimony.

Over the next two weeks, the jury heard arguments from the defense, with Bridget Anne Kelly on the spotlight, saying it was "crude humor". Bill Baroni maintained the argument that the traffic jams were part of a legitimate study to determine "whether congestion on the main approaches to the toll plaza could be reduced if the lanes earmarked for Fort Lee were eliminated."

The complaint specifically said that Christie had failed to stop the closure then in progress when, according to Wildstein's sworn testimony, Christie heard about it from Baroni and Wildstein on Wednesday, September 11, 2013, the third day of the closure.

On October 13, 2016, Judge Roy F. McGeady, the presiding judge for the municipal courts in Bergen County, accepted [[jurisdiction]] based on the events having occurred in Fort Lee. Christie was represented by the law firm of [[Alston &amp; Bird]] at the [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] hearing. McGready ruled, "I'm satisfied that there's [[probable cause]] to believe that an event of official misconduct was caused by Governor Christie. I'm going to issue the [[summons]]."   The audience in the courtroom applauded.&lt;ref name="Ma-2016-10-13"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ma|first1=Myles|title=Bridgegate misconduct complaint against Christie can move forward|url=http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2016/10/judge_rules_christie_could_be_charged_with_officia.html|accessdate=October 13, 2016|publisher=NJ Advance Media|date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That summons put the case into the hands of the Bergen County prosecutor's office, which must decide whether to bring an indictment against Christie. Prosecutor Gurbir S. Grewal was appointed by Christie, and so was expected to [[Judicial disqualification|recuse]] himself.&lt;ref name=Ma-2016-10-13/&gt;

The report, released on March 27, 2014, found that Christie had no advance knowledge of the bridge "lane realignment," and didn't know why it happened. It blamed Bridget Kelly and David Wildstein for orchestrating the toll lane closures. The report revealed that Wildstein said that he informed Christie of the ongoing lane closures during a September 11, 2013, memorial event, but asserted that Christie did not recall that exchange.&lt;ref name="Rings True"&gt;Dann, Carrie.

NBC News. March 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The report also found "no evidence" that Stepien or Baroni knew of the improper motives for the lane closures, although they were aware that the lanes were to be closed and that traffic patterns were to be changed as a result.&lt;ref name="Rings True"/&gt;

The report said the lane closures were political retribution against Sokolich but did not identify the specific motive. However, it noted the day before her infamous "Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee" message, Kelly confirmed that Sokolich would not endorse Christie.

In April 2014, [[U.S. Internal Revenue Service]] filings disclosed that Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher donated $10,000 to the [[Republican Governors Association]], of which Christie was then chairman.

After Assemblyman Wisniewski gave a deadline of April 11, 2014, for providing the interview records, which were part of the basis of the report, or they would be subpoenaed, Gibson Dunn turned over on that date a list of 75 persons interviewed for the report. On April 14, the interview notes were turned over to the committee and U.S. Attorney's office, and publicly released.&lt;ref name=Baxter-2014-04-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=Linhorst-2014-04-14/&gt; Gibson Dunn lawyers said that there were no recordings or verbatim transcripts of the interviews, prompting Wisniewski to characterize the conclusions from these interviews as "[[Hearsay in United States law|hearsay]]".&lt;ref name=Magyar-2014-04-15&gt;{{cite news|last=Magyar|first=Mark J.|title=Bridgegate Panel To Begin Calling Witnesses Next Month|url=http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/14/04/15/bridgegate-panel-to-begin-calling-witnesses-next-month/?p=all|accessdate=April 15, 2014|publisher=NJSpotlight|date=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were nearly 370 instances in which the persons interviewed could not recall details about events they were asked to address.&lt;ref name=Linhorst-2014-04-14/&gt;

The interview notes contained information that was downplayed or omitted from the original Mastro report, showing a governor's office in which government and political operations were deeply connected. They showed how the governor's office worked to secure Democratic endorsements and coordinated with Christie's election campaign to penalize mayors who did not endorse Christie in his re-election.&lt;ref name="Linhorst-2014-04-14"/&gt;

In July 2015, a federal court ruling ordered that materials used to prepare the report be made available to legal defense teams of those indicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2015/07/judge_orders_law_firm_to_turn_over_bridgegate_prob.html#incart_river|title=Judge orders law firm to turn over Bridgegate probe notes|work=NJ.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christie's responses==
On December 2, 2013, Christie said at a press conference that Democrats were just playing politics by holding hearings into lane closures. "Just because [Rep.] John Wisniewski is obsessed with this, and [Sen.] Loretta Weinberg, it just shows that they really have nothing to do," Christie said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillis|first=Michael|title=Christie says it's Democrats, not he, playing politics with GWB traffic flap|url=http://www.northjersey.com/fortlee/Christie_says_its_Democrats_not_him_playing_politics_with_GWB_traffic_flap.html|work=The Record|location=Woodland Park, NJ|date=December 3, 2013|accessdate=January 10, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108190746/http://www.northjersey.com/fortlee/Christie_says_its_Democrats_not_him_playing_politics_with_GWB_traffic_flap.html|archivedate=January 8, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christie later credited the e-mail documents subpoenaed by the hearings as the first information he had that his staff was involved.&lt;ref name="Press transcript Jan. 9 2014"/&gt; When reporter [[Matt Katz (journalist)|Matt Katz]] asked, "Governor, did you have anything to do with these lane closures in September outside the GW Bridge?

Christie questioned the policy of allowing three dedicated lanes, saying "I didn't know Fort Lee got three dedicated lanes until all this stuff happened, and I think we should review that entire policy.

In a nearly two-hour press conference on January 9, 2014, Christie apologized for the toll lane closures and said that he was "embarrassed and humiliated" by the behavior of his staff. Christie claimed he first learned of his staff's involvement via news media reports on January 8.

Christie said "I have had no contact with David Wildstein in a long time, a long time, well before the election." Christie was re-elected Governor on November 5, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/election-information-archive-2013.html|title=2013 Election Information|publisher=New Jersey Department of State|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 11, 2013, during the third day of the closures, Christie, Wildstein, Samson and Baroni were photographed together at the site of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] during a commemoration of the 12th anniversary of the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks]].&lt;ref name=wildsteinphoto/&gt;

In the press conference, Christie described his earlier efforts to determine his staff's involvement, saying: "I brought my senior staff together I think about four weeks ago tomorrow. And I put to all of them one simple challenge: If there is any information that you know about the decision to close these lanes in Fort Lee, you have one hour to tell either my chief of staff, [[Kevin O'Dowd]], or my chief counsel, [[Charlie McKenna]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cillizza|first=Chris|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/01/10/5-big-unanswered-questions-in-bridge-gate|title=5 big unanswered questions in Bridge-gate|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The governor's office issued a statement on January 31, 2014, that denied the allegations about Christie that were contained in a January 31 letter from Alan Zegas (Wildstein's attorney) to the PA, which had been made public. The letter questioned the accuracy of various statements made by Christie about his client, without providing any specific references, and claimed that there is evidence of Christie being aware of the toll lane closures at the time that they were closed. The governor's office said that Christie stood by his position that he "first learned lanes were closed when it was reported by the press".&lt;ref name="Wildstein attorney letter 1"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kurdzuk | first = Tony | title = Attorney for ex-Port Authority official David Wildstein accuses Chris Christie of lying | work = The Star-Ledger |location= Newark, NJ  | date =  January 31, 2014  | url = http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/01/attorney_for_david_wildstein_asks_port_authority_to_reconsider_paying_legal_bills.html |accessdate=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wildstein attorney letter 2"&gt;{{cite news | last = Brent | first = Johnson | title = Chris Christie responds to new bridge scandal allegations | work = The Star-Ledger |location= Newark, NJ  | date = January 31, 2014 | url = http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/01/chris_christie_responds_to_new_bridge_scandal_allegations.html#incart_maj-story-2 |accessdate=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christie previously said in his December 13 press conference that this was well after the toll lanes for local traffic were reopened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Shawn|last=Boburg|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/Christe_knew_about_GWB_lane_closures.html|title=GWB scandal: Christie knew of bridge lane closures, ex-Port Authority official says|work=The Record|location=Woodland Park, NJ|date=January 31, 2014|accessdate=January 31, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201015949/http://www.northjersey.com/news/Christe_knew_about_GWB_lane_closures.html|archivedate=February 1, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his monthly talk radio broadcast on February 3, Christie said he was cooperating with subpoenas from the state legislative committee and the U.S. Attorney to his governor's office, which began turning over documents to the legislative committee earlier in the day and would continue to do so as the requested items were located.&lt;ref name="Christie's office files"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Shawn|last1=Boburg|first2=Melissa|last2=Hayes|lastauthoramp=yes|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/Bridget_Kelly_invokes_Fifth_Amendment_declines_to_produce_subpoened_documents.html?page=all|title=Feds seek files from Christie's office; ex-aide Kelly won't turn over documents in response to subpoena|work=The Record|location=Woodland Park, NJ|date=February 3, 2014|accessdate=February 4, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221142414/http://www.northjersey.com/news/Bridget_Kelly_invokes_Fifth_Amendment_declines_to_produce_subpoened_documents.html?page=all|archivedate=February 21, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 17, Christie enacted two recommendations of the Mastro report. He eliminated the Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs, which had been headed by Bridget Kelly. He named [[Patrick E. Hobbs]], [[Dean (education)|dean]] of [[Seton Hall University School of Law]], Christie's ''[[alma mater]]'', as a part-time [[ombudsman]] to address complaints about misconduct, enhance ethics training and accountability, and improve electronic communications in the governor's office. Critics noted that Christie's staff and others had used personal e-mails to avoid public scrutiny.&lt;ref name=Baxter-2014-04-17/&gt;

Hobbs retained his Seton Hall post.&lt;ref name=Baxter-2014-04-17&gt;{{cite news|last=Baxter|first=Christopher|title=Christie names Seton Hall dean as ombudsman in response to bridge scandal review|work=The Star-Ledger|location= Newark, NJ|date=April 17, 2014|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/04/in_response_to_bridge_scandal_review_christie_names_seton_hall_dean_as_ombudsman.html |accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Linhorst-2014-04-17&gt;{{cite news|last1=Linhorst|first1=Michael|last2=Hayes|first2=Melissa|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Christie taps Seton Hall dean to help revamp office in wake of GWB scandal|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/christie-taps-seton-hall-dean-to-help-revamp-office-in-wake-of-gwb-scandal-1.998470|accessdate=April 20, 2014|newspaper=The Record|date=April 17, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421064627/http://www.northjersey.com/news/christie-taps-seton-hall-dean-to-help-revamp-office-in-wake-of-gwb-scandal-1.998470|archivedate=April 21, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hobbs asserted that Christie had given him "full authority and independence" and would leave the job if he felt impeded.

On April 24, Christie denied creating a "culture of divisiveness" or that perceptions about his attitude may have led others to plan and allow the lane closures to occur as retaliation. "If in fact I created a culture where people were going after each other, then how did we do all these things together with Republicans and Democrats?"

After the May 2015 indictment of Baroni and Kelly and the Wildstein guilty plea, Christie said that the outcome of the federal investigation was a vindictation.

===Public opinion===

====National polls====
In January 2014, there was a wide range of opinion about the long-term impact of this scandal on a potential [[Chris Christie#Presidential politics|Christie 2016 presidential bid]] for the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]].&lt;ref name="Political fallout"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caldwell|first1=Leigh Ann|title=Christie drops swagger amid heat of scandal|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/09/politics/christie-bridge/index.html?hpt=hp_t1|publisher=CNN|date=January 9, 2014|accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Frumin |first=Aliyah|title=Christie apologizes: 'I am embarrassed and humiliated'|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/christie-apology-bridge-scandal|publisher=NBC News|date=January 9, 2014|accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By early February, national polling&lt;ref name="McClatchy poll-2014-02-09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN poll-2014-02-02"/&gt; showed a substantial erosion in his political standing and 2016 presidential campaign prospects.&lt;ref name="Christie image"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Conroy|first=Scott|title=RCP's Scott Conroy on Whether Christie Can Weather the Storm |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/01/22/rcps_scott_conroy_christies_2016_chances_have_taken_a_big_hit.html|publisher=Real Clear Politics|accessdate=February 19, 2014|date=January 22, 2014}}(Interview with Steve Chaggaris of CBS News)&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Quinnipiac University Polling Institute|Quinnipiac]] poll, published January 21, showed him trailing former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]], the leading potential Democratic contender, 46% to 38%, which was a downturn from two previous polls that showed Christie and Clinton about even, after Christie had gained considerably in the polls against her since March 2013. Peoples' view of his presidential capabilities went down with 35% agreeing and 36% disagreeing that he would make a good president. This was down from 49% agreeing to 31% disagreeing in a November poll. For those who had heard of the Bridgegate scandal, 50% said this scandal would hurt Christie's presidential hopes, and made 34% of those polled less likely to vote for him. His favorability rating declined to only 33% viewing him generally as favorable with 30% unfavorable. This was down from his highest rating of 47% favorable to 23% unfavorable in December 2013. The poll showed that he had gone from the leading potential Republican candidate in December to a statistical tie with three others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=1998|title=Bridgegate Takes Toll On Christie's 2016 Hopes, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds; Hillary Clinton Is Big Winner As NJ Gov Crashes|publisher=Rasmussen Reports|date=January 21, 2014|accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Jersey polls====
A [[Rasmussen Reports|Rasmussen]] poll of New Jersey residents, published January 10, 2014, showed that 56% believe Christie should resign "if it is proven that he approved of retaliation against an elected official who refused to support him." Only 29% disagreed. A majority believed it was at least somewhat likely that Christie was aware that the September toll lane closures were retaliation for the mayor of Fort Lee's refusal to support his re-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_state_surveys/new_jersey/56_in_nj_think_christie_should_resign_if_he_knew_about_fort_lee_retaliation|title=56% in NJ Think Christie Should Resign If He Knew About Fort Lee Retaliation|publisher=Rasmussen Reports|date=January 10, 2014|accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Eagleton Institute of Politics|Rutgers-Eagleton]] poll, published January 24, 2014, showed that the Fort Lee scandal had hurt his standings among New Jersey residents. Christie's favorability rating, as governor, was shown to be 46%, down 22 points from just before his landslide re-election victory in November 2013, with 43% having an unfavorable view. While the majority of residents still approved his overall performance as governor, his 53% job approval was down 15 points from November. A majority, 56%, said that it was "very unlikely" or "somewhat unlikely" that Christie's top aides acted without his knowledge in the Fort Lee scandal. Only 20% said they fully believed Christie's explanation about this topic, while 42% did not believe his version at all and 33% only partially believed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Melissa|last=Hayes|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/politics/Christies_favorablility_rating_drops_after_GWB_controversy_poll_finds.html?page=all|title=Christie's favorable rating drops after GWB controversy, poll finds|work=The Record|location=Woodland Park, NJ|date=January 22, 2014|accessdate=January 24, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203134844/http://www.northjersey.com/news/politics/Christies_favorablility_rating_drops_after_GWB_controversy_poll_finds.html?page=all|archivedate=February 3, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Monmouth University Polling Institute|Monmouth University/Asbury Park Press]] poll, published February 24, 2014, showed Christie's job approval ratings in New Jersey at 50%, which was down 9% since January and 20% from 12 months prior. Other results showed 61% believed the governor was not completely honest about what he knew about the toll lane closures, and 50% (up from 34% in January) thought Christie was personally involved in the decision to close the toll lanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edwards-Levy|first=Ariel|title=Chris Christie's Approval Rating Continues To Fall In New Jersey|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/24/chris-christie-approval-rating_n_4848193.html|work=The Huffington Post|date=February 24, 2014|accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Christie Dragged Further Under the Bridge|url=http://www.monmouth.edu/assets/0/32212254770/32212254991/32212254992/32212254994/32212254995/30064771087/0748385b-f5b6-4465-b612-280bbab38eef.pdf|publisher=Monmouth University|format=PDF|date=February 24, 2014|accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar poll, released on April 2, showed his approval ratings to be about the same, remaining 14 points lower than December, before the Bridgegate scandal broke.

==Media coverage==
The lane closure controversy has received substantial attention from the New York area and national media.  The first story in the media about the lane closures, and the first to bring politics into the mix, was reported by ''[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]'''s John Cichowski in his Road Warrior column on September 13, 2013, that there was speculation that Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich was targeted "either for failing to endorse Governor Christie's election bid or for pushing through a $500 million, 47-story high-rise housing development near the bridge, or for failing to support the Port's last toll hike."&lt;ref name="Kleinfield-2014-01-12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cichowski-2013-09-13"/&gt;

On September 17, 2013, Ted Mann of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote a story about what could have possibly prompted the Port Authority to close toll lanes to local traffic without public notifications. Citing anonymous sources, he reported that "the decision to close the traffic lanes caused tension" since "the lane closures came as a surprise to some high-ranking officials at the bi-state agency." He said that the toll lanes were reopened to local traffic based on an order from Executive Director Patrick Foye, "who argued that the abrupt shift in traffic patterns caused a threat to public safety and should have been advertised to the public ahead of time."&lt;ref name="Bridge Jam Mystery"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ted|last=Mann|title=Bridge Jam's Cause a Mystery|date=September 17, 2013|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324665604579081630876156774?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424127887324665604579081630876156774.html|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=January 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subsequent newspaper report by Mann, published on October 1, 2013, was the first to address the contents and quote some of the text from Foye's September 13, 2013, e-mail to PA officials. Foye's e-mail ordered the toll lanes to be reopened, while denouncing the closures as an "abusive decision" and pledging to investigate "how PA process was wrongfully subverted and the public interest damaged" without Foye's knowledge. The e-mail said that there were potential violations of state and federal laws. PA insiders disputed that there was a traffic study. All of this reinforced the reported rumors that the toll lanes might have been closed by political surrogates of Governor Chris Christie, a Republican, as an alleged act of political retribution against Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for not endorsing Christie in his 2013 re-election campaign.&lt;ref name="Breaking news Oct 1, 2013"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ted|last=Mann|title=Port Chief Fumed Over Bridge Jam|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304373104579109860563887326|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=October 1, 2013|accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Record'', ''The Wall Street Journal'', and other news media continued to investigate the matter in comprehensive reporting over the next few months, using [[Source (journalism)|sources]] and requests for public records.

''The New York Times'' covered the lane closure story on December 8, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Emma G. Fitzsimmons |title=Christie Ally Resigning From Port Authority |date=December 8, 2013 &lt;!--inferred from URL despite online publication Dec. 7 --&gt; |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/nyregion/christie-ally-resigning-from-port-authority.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scandal broke in full on January 8, 2014, with an online story by Shawn Boburg of ''The Record''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Erik |last= Wemple |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/01/09/the-record-nails-christie-story/ |title= The Record nails Christie story |work= The Washington Post |date= January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= For Bergen Record's reporting, public records requests are 'the go-to tool' |url= http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/235612/for-bergen-records-reporting-public-records-requests-are-the-go-to-tool |first= Kristen |last= Hare |publisher= The Poynter Institute |date= January 13, 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140112015027/http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/235612/for-bergen-records-reporting-public-records-requests-are-the-go-to-tool/ |archivedate= January 12, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; that Christie's deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly was involved in the planning of the toll lane closures. That revelation catapulted the story into a national political event. ''The Record'' continued with details of the dialogues in the troves of e-mails and texts supplied to the New Jersey Assembly Transportation Committee by David Wildstein. ''The Record'' described "vindictive lane closures" that were intended to cause massive traffic jams in Fort Lee. Related news with quotes from the e-mails and texts were subsequently published the same day in other news media.&lt;ref name=Zernike/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bridgegate fever"&gt;{{cite news|first=Brendan|last=Nyhan|title=Bridge-gate fever!

[[MSNBC]] gave substantial coverage to the Bridgegate scandal, and the network's ratings reached their highest point since the 2013 [[Boston Marathon bombings]] when it covered Chris Christie's apologetic press conference on January 9, 2014.&lt;ref name="MSNBC ratings"&gt;{{cite news|last=Guthrie|first=Marisa|title=TV Ratings: MSNBC Boosted by New Jersey Gov.

Observing that Christie had ridiculed the media in 2013 for trying to implicate Wildstein and Baroni, Kornacki noted that by 2015, Wildstein had pleaded guilty to federal charges and Baroni was facing a federal indictment in connection with the scandal.&lt;ref name="KornackiResponse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/07/06/kornacki_to_christie_media_was_not_blaming_you_we_were_going_after_high-level_members_of_administration_.html |title=Kornacki to Christie: Media Was Not Blaming You, We Were Going After High-Level Members Of Administration |publisher=[[RealClearPolitics]] |date=June 6, 2015 |accessdate=October 31, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a decision on July 2, 2014, Superior Court Judge P. J. Innes ruled in favor of the [[North Jersey Media Group]], publisher of the newspaper ''The Record'', that the state must partially comply with open records request and turn over some information it had previously refused to release regarding current and former state employees' written requests for the state to appoint them attorneys or pay their legal fees resulting from parallel criminal and legislative investigations into the lane closures, though not the names of the employees. The state must pay the media group's legal fees. The media group plans to appeal, to gain fuller disclosure of the documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Akin | first = Stephanie | title = N.J. improperly withheld GWB info, judge rules | newspaper = The Record | date = July 3, 2014 | url = http://www.northjersey.com/news/n-j-improperly-withheld-gwb-info-judge-rules-1.1045599 | accessdate = July 3, 2014 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140810131410/http://www.northjersey.com/news/n-j-improperly-withheld-gwb-info-judge-rules-1.1045599 | archivedate = August 10, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development''' highlights the role that states and [[civil society]] must play in preventing and reducing violence associated with war, crime, and [[social unrest]]. The Declaration was adopted on 7 June 2006 and is now endorsed by 113 states. It is the strongest political statement to date that addresses the impact of armed violence within a development context. Regular high-level diplomatic regional meetings and ministerial review conferences take place to assess progress concerning the process and implementation of the Geneva Declaration; the first two ministerial review conferences took place in 2008 and 2011. During 2014 a series of Regional Review Conferences have been organized not only to review the process in implementing the Geneva Declaration but also to reflect and gather support in integrating meaningfully armed violence reduction in national and international development processes, including the post-2015 development agenda.

By signing the Geneva Declaration states commit to:&lt;ref&gt;Geneva Declaration Secretariat. 2008. ''The Global Burden of Armed Violence. Geneva: Geneva Declaration Secretariat&lt;/ref&gt;

* Support initiatives to measure the human, social and economic costs of armed violence;
* Undertake assessments to understand and respond to risks and vulnerabilities;
* Evaluate the effectiveness of armed violence prevention and reduction programs around the world; and
* To disseminate lessons and best practices.

Understanding that the fight against the global scourge of armed violence and the prospects for sustainable development are closely linked, the signatories recognize that armed violence constitutes a major obstacle to the achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Geneva-Declaration-Millennium-Development-Goals.pdf Armed Violence Prevention and Reduction: A Challenge for Achieving the Millennium Development Goals]&lt;/ref&gt; They agree to strengthen their efforts to integrate [[armed violence reduction]] and conflict prevention programs into national, regional, and multilateral development frameworks and strategies.

The approach is based on three pillars:

# Advocacy: dissemination and coordination initiatives for implementing the Geneva Declaration
# Measurability: country based armed violence mapping and monitoring to identify entry-points and opportunities for interventions
# Programming: practical programming on armed violence prevention and reduction

A Core Group of 14 signatory states and affiliated organizations is responsible for steering the process and guiding the implementation of the Geneva Declaration. Affiliated organizations include the Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery (BCPR) of the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), the [[Small Arms Survey]]—which also hosts the Geneva Declaration Secretariat—, the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), and the [[Quaker United Nations Office]] (QUNO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/the-geneva-declaration/how-does-it-work.html | title=The Geneva Declaration - How does it work?

'''Gille Coluim the Marischal''' was an official of the [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish crown]] in the second half of the 12th century. His name occurs in the witness lists of two extant charters, both issued by King [[William I of Scotland|William of Scotland]] at [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], which indicates that he was probably a native of somewhere in southern [[Perthshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[G. W. S. Barrow]], ''The Acts of William I: King of Scots, 1165-1214'', (= ''Regesta Regum Scottorum'', volume ii), (Edinburgh, 1971)p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; He seems in fact to have been the lord of [[Madderty]] in [[Strathearn]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', no. 258, pp. 291-2.&lt;/ref&gt; In either 1172 or 1173 he witnessed King William's grant of [[Ardross, Highland|Ardross]] to Merleswain mac Cholbaín, a relative of the [[mormaer of Fife]].;&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; and somewhere between 1178 and 1185 he witnessed the king's grant of lands in [[Inverness-shire]] to [[Gille Brigte, Earl of Strathearn|Gille Brigte]], [[Mormaer of Strathearn]]. In both of these charters, the grants are to [[Gaels|native Scots]] and Gille Coluim appears alongside other native Scots, such as (in both cases) Gille Críst mac ingine Samuel ("Gillecrist mac inien Samüel") and Gille Míchéil mac Donnchada ("Gillemichel mac Dunecan"). Gille Coluim in both cases appears with the title "Marescal", meaning that he was the king's military commander. It appears to be in this role that Gille Coluim was given control of the castle at [[Auldearn]] ("Heryn") in [[Moray]] during a rebellion by the [[Meic Uilleim]], a royal kindred who were claiming the throne of [[Scotland]]. A charter issued by King William at [[Linlithgow]], between 1187 and 1189 grants Gille Brigte, [[mormaer]] of Strathearn, the land of Madderty and states that neither Gille Coluim nor his heirs have any right to the land after giving up Auldearn to the ''Meic Uilleim''.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', no. 258, pp. 291-2.&lt;/ref&gt; In the charter, King William declares that Gille Coluim &lt;blockquote&gt;"feloniously surrendered my castle of Heryn and then went over to my mortal enemies in the manner of a wicked traitor and stood with them against me to do as much harm as he could".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', no. 258, p. 292; translated in R. Andrew McDonald, ''Outlaws of Medieval Scotland: Challenges to the Canmore Kings, 1058–1266'', (East Linton, 2003), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; We can be certain then that Gille Coluim surrendered the castle during the insurrection of Domnall MacUilleim ("Donald MacWilliam") which took place between 1179 and 1187.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing more is heard of Gille Coluim. The charter indicates that Gille Coluim was not dead at the time of issue (no later than 1190)&lt;ref&gt;Barrow, ''The Acts of William I'', p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; and his death is not otherwise reported.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2672">The '''Guardia alla Frontiera''' (GaF), was an [[Italian Army]] [[Border guard]] created in 1937&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vecio.it/cms/index.php/guardia-alla-frontiera/322-storia-della-guardia-alla-frontiera  History of the "Guardia alla Frontiera" (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt; who defended the 1.851&amp;nbsp;km of northern Italian frontiers with the so-called "Vallo Alpino Occidentale" (487&amp;nbsp;km with [[France]]), "Vallo Alpino Settentrionale" (724&amp;nbsp;km with [[Switzerland]] and 420&amp;nbsp;km with [[Austria]]) and "Vallo Alpino Orientale" (220&amp;nbsp;km with [[Yugoslavia]]).

In 1940 the GaF had 21,000 military personnel, deployed in eight commands, 27 sectors and seven regiments of artillery. It manned 1,000 fortifications, 6,000 machine guns, 1,000 mortars, 100 [[Cannone da 47/32 M35]] , and another thousand other medium and small-caliber cannons ([[Cannone da 75/27 modello 11|75/27]] and [[Cannone da 149/35 A|149/35]]).

The GaF was divided into the following "Corpi d'Armata":
*I-Torino
*II-Alessandria
*III-Milano
*IV-Bolzano
*V-Trieste
*XI-Udine
*XIV-Treviso
*XV-Genova

By 10 June 1940 (Italy's entry into the war) the GaF (not counting colonies in Libya  and Albania) contained 23 sectors, 50,000 men, 28 battalions "Vallo Alpino", 22 battalions of [[Blackshirts|fascist militia]].

==Field organization==
Each command of the army of GaF could be divided into "sectors" (27 areas of coverage, from I to XXVII, along the border; sectors XVIII, XIX and XX were never realized), which could break down in "sub" and then in "groups of milestones" and so on for ever smaller units. Each command in the field had two or more subsectors which controlled the fortifications. These works were manned by infantry, artillery, engineers, etc. Despite the GaF was a body predominantly static type, its dependencies were also made five light tank (carristi) companies, equipped with [[Fiat 3000]] that over time, due to their age and lack of spare parts, ended largely abandoned in  Sector armories or buried in order to use the turrets as a fort.

The Guardia alla Frontiera disappeared after 1943, but nominally was active until 1953.&lt;ref&gt;

==Definition==
A health risk assessment (HRA) is a health questionnaire, used to provide individuals with an evaluation of their health risks and quality of life.&lt;ref name=" Using online health risk"&gt;Baker K, DeJoy D, and Wilson M.  [http://www.allbusiness.com/medicine-health/diet-nutrition-fitness-exercise/11705337-1.html Using online health risk assessments], The Journal of Employee Assistance. April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly a HRA incorporates three key elements{{spaced ndash}}an extended questionnaire, a risk calculation or score, and some form of feedback i.e. face-to-face with a health advisor or an automatic online report.&lt;ref name="Health Risk Appraisal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Using online health risk"/&gt;

[[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] define a HRA as: “a systematic approach to collecting information from individuals that identifies risk factors, provides individualised feedback, and links the person with at least one intervention to promote health, sustain function and/or prevent disease.” &lt;ref name="CDC Health risk appraisals"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/hwi/program_design/health_risk_appraisals.htm#Meaning Health Risk Appraisals], Visited 9 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a range of different HRAs available for adults and children. Some target specific populations. For example, in the US, Medicare HRAs ask seniors about their ability to perform daily activities.

In the US, HRAs used as part of the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit help identify issues important to a senior’s health and well-being. HRAs used as part of Medicaid enrollment help identify individuals with health problems that need immediate attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services|title=Preventive visit &amp; yearly wellness exams.|url=http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services|title=Core Set of Children’s Health Care Quality Measures for Medicaid and CHIP (Child Core Set)|url=http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Quality-of-Care/Downloads/Medicaid-and-CHIP-Child-Core-Set-Manual.pdf|access-date=13 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208032330/http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Quality-of-Care/Downloads/Medicaid-and-CHIP-Child-Core-Set-Manual.pdf|archive-date=8 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original concept of the HRA can be traced back to the decision by the assistant Surgeon General of the United States to conduct a study to determine probable 10-year lifespan of individuals based on lifestyles and predisposed conditions.  The project, led by Lewis C. Robbins, MD,&lt;ref name="Appraising health risk appraisals"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Schoenbach VJ |title=Appraising health risk appraisal |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=77 |issue=4 |pages=409–11 |date=April 1987 |pmid=3826457 |pmc=1646957 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.77.4.409}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Public Health Service, was the Framingham study.  The study was based on in-depth longitudinal studies of 5,000 families in Framingham, Massachusetts, that continues to this day under funding from the National Institutes of Health.
Dr. Robbins left the Public Health Service and joined Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis where, working with Jack Hall, MD, he developed the first set of health hazard tables. This culminated in the publication of How to Practice Prospective Medicine in 1970 – a guide for practising physicians, which outlined the health risk assessment questionnaire, risk computations and patient feedback strategies.&lt;ref name="Chapter 15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Appraising health risk appraisals"/&gt; It wasn't until 1980, when the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] released a publicly available version, that the HRA became widely used, particularly in workplace settings.&lt;ref name="Using online health risk"/&gt;
Health &amp; Welfare Canada reviewed How to Practice Prospective Medicine and created a mainframe version of the book.  The Centers for Disease Control became aware of this product and adapted it to the newly available personal computer.  When Prudential Life Insurance also took an interest and asked to fund an update of the program, the CDC, which could not accept private project funding at the time, transferred ownership to the Carter Center at Emory University where it was updated from 1986-7.  The transfer and subsequent program were managed by Dr. Ed Hutchins who had worked on the HRA in positions at the University of Pennsylvania and Charlotte-Mecklenberg Hospital.  At Charlotte Mecklenberg, he secured a contract with the World Health Organization to create a mainframe product that could be used on an international basis.
The HRA was managed as a not-for-profit product.  Copies were distributed to every state health department and liaisons were assigned to each to work with their staffs to evaluate related data.  Over 2,000 copies of the software were distributed to users who requested it and approximately 70 copies of the code were provided to for-profit companies that were interested in developing proprietary products.  This proliferation coincided with the rapid growth in interest in corporate health promotion programs as awareness developed on health risks and for-profit vendors monetized the programs.
The Carter Center's interest shifted to Africa and Dr. Hutchins founded the Healthier People Network (HPN) which in 1991 to continue the work.  HPN raised funds to support the HRA but additional funding was not forthcoming from government sources.  As a result, the Carter Center and HPN could not underwrite basic supporting activities such as annual conferences and, over time, the State-based liaison network and associated intellectual capital atrophied as programs lost funding and liaisons moved on.
The use of HRAs and corporate wellness programs has been most prevalent in the United States, with comparatively slower growth elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Chapter 15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The development"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mills PR |title=The development of a new corporate specific health risk measurement instrument, and its use in investigating the relationship between health and well-being and employee productivity |journal=Environmental Health |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=1 |year=2005 |pmid=15679885 |pmc=548523 |doi=10.1186/1476-069X-4-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has been recent strong growth in corporate wellness outside the US, particularly in Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name="Working well"&gt;{{Cite book|date=October 2008 |url=http://www.buckconsultants.co.uk/BuckConsultantsUK/Portals/0/Documents/Publications/SURVEYS/Global%20Wellness%202008%20Survey%20Report%20UK.pdf |publisher=Buck Consultants |title=Working well: A global survey of health promotion and workplace wellness strategies}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Once an individual completes a HRA, they usually receive a report, detailing their health rating or score, often broken down into specific sub scores and areas such as stress, nutrition and fitness.&lt;ref name="Health Risk Appraisal" /&gt; The report can also provide recommendations on how individuals can reduce their health risks by changing their lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Appraising health risk appraisals"/&gt;

In addition to individual feedback, HRAs are also used to provide aggregated [[data reporting]] for employers and organizations.&lt;ref name="Chapter 15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The development"/&gt; These reports include demographic data of participants, highlight health risk areas and often include cost projections and savings in terms of increased healthcare, absence and productivity.&lt;ref name="Chapter 15"/&gt; Organization-level reports can then be used to provide a first step by which organizations can target and monitor appropriate health interventions within their workforce.&lt;ref name="The development"/&gt;

==HRA delivery==
The delivery of HRAs has changed over the years in conjunction with advances in technology. Initially distributed as paper-based, self-scoring questionnaires through on-site workplace health promotion sessions, HRAs are now most commonly implemented online.&lt;ref name="Using online health risk"/&gt; Other delivery methods include telephone, mail and face-to-face.&lt;ref name="Using online health risk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC Health risk appraisals"/&gt;

The advantages of online HRAs include:&lt;ref name="Using online health risk"/&gt;
* Tailoring – online HRAs can adapt content based on an individual’s answers to the HRA questionnaire to provide a personalised, relevant and interactive user experience.
* Improved data management
* Reduced administrative costs
* Instant feedback

==Efficacy==
Extensive research has shown that HRAs can be used effectively to:
* Identify health risk factors.&lt;ref name="Association between wellness score"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Financial costs due to"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Yen L, Schultz A, Schnueringer E, Edington DW |title=Financial costs due to excess health risks among active employees of a utility company |journal=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine |volume=48 |issue=9 |pages=896–905 |date=September 2006 |pmid=16966956 |doi=10.1097/01.jom.0000235987.75368.d0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The relationship between modifiable"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Anderson DR, Whitmer RW, Goetzel RZ, etal |title=The relationship between modifiable health risks and group-level health care expenditures.

* Evaluate the efficacy and return on investment of [[health promotion]] strategies &lt;ref name="Impact of a health promotion program on employee health risks"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Mills PR, Kessler RC, Cooper J, Sullivan S |title=Impact of a health promotion program on employee health risks and work productivity |journal=American Journal of Health Promotion |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=45–53 |year=2007 |pmid=17894263 |doi=10.4278/0890-1171-22.1.45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The association between health risk change and presenteeism change"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Burton WN, Chen CY, Conti DJ, Schultz AB, Edington DW |title=The association between health risk change and presenteeism change |journal=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=252–63 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16531829 |doi=10.1097/01.jom.0000201563.18108.af}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also recent evidence to suggest that taking a HRA alone can have a positive effect on health behavior change and health status.&lt;ref name="“A return on investment evaluation"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ozminkowski RJ, Dunn RL, Goetzel RZ, Cantor RI, Murnane J, Harrison M |title=A return on investment evaluation of the Citibank, N.A., health management program |journal=American Journal of Health Promotion |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=31–43 |year=1999 |pmid=10621522 |doi=10.4278/0890-1171-14.1.31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The savings gained from participation in health "&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Ozminkowski RJ, Goetzel RZ, Wang F, etal |title=The savings gained from participation in health promotion programs for Medicare beneficiaries |journal=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine |volume=48 |issue=11 |pages=1125–32 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17099448 |doi=10.1097/01.jom.0000240709.01860.8a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is generally accepted that HRAs are most effective at promoting behavior change when they form part of an integrated, multi-component health promotion program.&lt;ref name="Health Risk Appraisal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapter 15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The impact of worksite-based health risk appraisal"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Anderson DR, Staufacker MJ |title=The impact of worksite-based health risk appraisal on health-related outcomes: a review of the literature |journal=American Journal of Health Promotion |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=499–508 |year=1996 |pmid=10163313 |doi=10.4278/0890-1171-10.6.499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied in this way, the HRA is used primarily as a tool to identify health risks within a population and then target health interventions and behavior change programs to address these areas.&lt;ref name="Using online health risk"/&gt;

==Limitations==
The limitations of a HRA are largely related to its usage and it is important to recognise that a HRA highlights health risks but does not diagnose disease and should not replace consultation with a medical or health practitioner.&lt;ref name="Health Risk Appraisal" /&gt;

==Providers==
There are reportedly over 50 different HRA providers in the market, offering a variety of versions and formats.&lt;ref name="Health Risk Appraisal" /&gt; Major vendors generally have National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) Wellness and Health Promotion (WHP) Certification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Committee for Quality Assurance|title=Wellness &amp; Health Promotion Report Card|url=http://reportcard.ncqa.org/WHP/External/WHPRatings.aspx?OrgName=pdhi}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Health Information Products (HIP) Certification.

The '''Homestead Act of 1860''' in the [[United States]] would have made land available for 25 cents per [[acre]]. This act was passed by the [[United States Congress]], but was ultimately [[veto]]ed by President [[James Buchanan]]. The late 19th century and early 20th century were a time of violent conflict over land use in the American West. The Johnson County War in Wyoming was one of the worst episodes in the saga.

==Proponents==
This was at a time where northerners had an idea that the government should give {{convert|160|acre|km2|sing=on}} plots of land to [[American pioneer|pioneers]] for free. 
People went to the west to start new lives and for the cheap land.

== Opposition ==
There was much worry with the free land idea. The southerners, who were still [[pro-slavery]], worried that this would result in the west becoming populated with [[Free Soil Party|free-soiler]]s. This in turn would create many anti-slavery states, creating an imbalance in the [[US Senate|Senate]] against the South. Another group who opposed this idea was the Eastern [[industrialists]]. They feared employees would be drained into the West for free land.

'''[[Insider threat]] management''' is the process of preventing, combating, detecting, and monitoring employees, remote vendors and contractors, to fortify an organization's data from theft, fraud and damage.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Combating%20the%20Insider%20Threat_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
An insider is an individual who is employed by an agency and has access to facilities, sensitive information, organizational data, information systems, and other equipment.&lt;ref name="national insider"&gt;{{cite web|title=Insider Threats Incidents, Data Breaches, News, Examples - Could They Happen To Your Organization|url=http://www.nationalinsiderthreatsig.org/pdfs/Insider%20Threats%20Incidents-Could%20They%20Happen%20To%20Your%20Organization.pdf|website=www.NationalInsiderThreatSig.org|publisher=|access-date=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may have accounts giving them legitimate access to computer systems, with this access originally having been given to them to serve in the performance of their duties; these permissions could be abused to harm the organization. Insiders are often familiar with the organization's data and intellectual property as well as the methods that are in place to protect them. This makes it easier for the insider to circumvent any security controls of which they are aware. Physical proximity to data means that the insider does not need to hack into the organizational network through the outer perimeter by traversing firewalls; rather they are in the building already, often with direct access to the organization's internal network. Insider threats are harder to defend against than attacks from outsiders since the insider already has legitimate access to the organization's information and assets.&lt;ref name="FBI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/counterintelligence/the-insider-threat |title=FBI Counterintelligence: The Insider Threat. An introduction to detecting and deterring an insider spy |publisher=FBI.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210135443/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/counterintelligence/the-insider-threat |archivedate=2014-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insiders may comprise permanent and temporary employees, vendors, contractors, suppliers, or ex-employees. &lt;ref name="Dark" /&gt;Most common insiders are those that have elevated access where they can utilize sensitive information without drawing suspicion. However, anyone can be an insider threat to an organization if they do not dispose, secure, utilize sensitive information described in an agency's regulations. There have been cases where individuals are compromised by an opposing agency and exploited by the individual's financial status, threats on their life, or other factors in order to force the individual to comply with the opposing agencies demands.

==Criminal activity==
An insider may attempt to steal property or information for personal gain, or to benefit another organization or country.&lt;ref name = "FBI" /&gt; These attacks may range from information data being stolen to the destruction of business property. Insiders may perform the following threats against their organization:
* Espionage, criminal enterprise, fraud, theft and unauthorized disclosure of information (Classified information, sensitive information, intellectual property, trade secrets, Personally Identifiable Information (PII) )
* Information technology sabotage
* Any action that results in the loss or degradation of organization resources or capabilities and it's ability to accomplish its mission or business function.
* Acts of terrorism&lt;ref name="national insider"/&gt;

==Common insider identifiers==
Insiders have similar characteristics that can be compiled to in order to help determine possible threats. Most researchers have identified that insiders mainly show antisocial behavior that may include but not limited to: [[Machiavellianism]], [[narcissism]], and [[psychopathy]].&lt;ref name="Dark"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maasberg|first1=M|title=The Dark Side of the Insider: Detecting the Insider Threat through Examination of Dark Triad Personality Traits|journal=IEEE|date=2015|doi=10.1109/HICSS.2015.423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the information system side, there is the list of common behavioral indicators of known insiders:
* Downloading substantial amounts of data to external drives
* Accessing confidential data that is not relevant to a user's role
* Emailing sensitive information to a personal account
* Attempts to bypass security controls
* Requests for clearance or higher-level access without need;
*Frequently accessing the workspace outside of normal working hours;
*Irresponsible social media behaviors;
*Maintaining access to sensitive data after termination;
*Using unauthorized external storage devices;
*Visible disgruntlement toward employers or co-workers;
*Chronic violation of organization policies;
*Decline in work performance;
*Use of mobile devices to photograph  or otherwise record computer screens, common work areas or data centers;
*Excessive use of printers and scanners;
*Electronic communications containing excessive use of negative language;
*Installing unapproved software;
*Communication with high-risk current or former employees;
*Traveling to countries known for intellectual property (IP) theft or hosting competitors;
*Violation of corporate policies;
*Network crawling, data hoarding or copying from internal repositories;
*Anomalies in work hours;
*Attempts to access restricted areas;
*Indications of living beyond one's means
* Discussions of resigning or new business ventures; and
* Complaints of hostile, abnormal, unethical or illegal behaviors

[[Max Weber]] is considered an eminent founder of modern [[social sciences]], rivaled by the figures of [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Karl Marx]]. Some students of Weberian thought have paid less attention to Weber's extensive and often passionate engagement with the politics of his day, particularly in the United States. However, European intellectuals have given more attention to his political thought. Most of Weber's political writings have not been published in translation, or have been translated only recently in a piecemeal form.

==Overview==
Weber's political ideas have inspired disagreement in [[Germany]] for decades.  His conception of [[democracy]] has been the subject of particularly heated debate.  Weber rejected the [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelmine regime's]] [[authoritarian]] political structure.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{Cite book |last=Weber |first=Max |title="Parliament and Government in a Re-constructed Germany," Economy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology |author2=Günther Roth |author3=Claus Wittich  |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=1978 |isbn=0-520-03500-3 |pages=1381–1569}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He advocated [[parliamentary]] and democratic reform.&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt;  Weber championed the [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedoms]] of what he called the "age of the [[Rights of Man]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Weber |first=Max |title=Economy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology |author2=Günther Roth |author3=Claus Wittich  |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=1978 |isbn=0-520-03500-3 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some find the liberalism of Weber as problematic.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;{{Cite book |last=Aron |first=Raymond |authorlink=Raymond Aron |title=Main Currents in Sociological Thought |volume=2 |author2=Richard Howard |author3=Helen Weaver |publisher=Basic Books Inc |location=New York |year=1967 |pages=242, 248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=refa/&gt;&lt;ref name=refa/&gt;&lt;ref name=refb&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mayer |first=Jacob Peter |title=Max Weber and German Politics: A study in  political sociology |publisher=Faber and Faber Limited |location=London |year=1944 |pages=30, 83, 89–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref6/&gt;

[[Raymond Aron]] has noted that Weber was not a "[[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] in the American sense," and not, "strictly speaking, a democrat in the sense that the French, the English, or the Americans gave the term."&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt; Aron saw Weber to have looked to place the "glory of the [[nation]] and the [[Political power|power]] of the [[State (polity)|state]]" above all other things.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

[[Stephen P. Turner]] and [[Regis A. Factor]] have concluded that Weber rejected the philosophical basis for most Western formulations of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[liberalism]].&lt;ref name=refa&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mommsen |first=Wolfgang J. |title=Max Weber and German Politics: 1890-1920 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1984 |isbn=0-226-53399-9 |page=392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref3&gt;{{Cite book |last=Turner |first=Stephen P. |author2=Regis A.

==Interpretations==
===Political views===
[[J-P Mayer]] wrote a 1944 critique of Max Weber, entitled ''Max Weber and German Politics: a study in political sociology''. Published in England during the war, this work never appeared in German translation.&lt;ref name=refa /&gt;&lt;ref name="refb" /&gt; Mayer had been an archivist for the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the primary book reviewer for the ''[[Vorwärts]]'', the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] party paper. He was a target of [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecution, from which he escaped to England.  There he became involved with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and was a member of the faculty at the [[London School of Economics]] during the last part of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=ref3 /&gt;

Mayer labeled Weber's philosophy as the "new [[Machiavellianism]] of the steel age." The conception of the [[State (polity)|state]] that Weber supported was viewed as a middle phase in a destructive tradition of German [[realpolitik]]—a tradition that Mayer saw to extend from [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] to [[Hitler]].&lt;ref name=refa /&gt;&lt;ref name="refb" /&gt; Mayer interpreted a "tragic" satisfaction with which Weber was seen to embrace "the empty character" of [[Heinrich Rickert]]'s neo-[[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] philosophy of value.&lt;ref name="refb" /&gt; Mayer viewed Weber's value theory as a nihilistic contribution to the rise of [[National Socialism]].

[[Wolfgang J. Mommsen]] initiated debate by arguing this in the 1959 German publication of ''Max Weber and German Politics 1890–1920''.&lt;ref name=ref6&gt;{{cite book |last=Mommsen |first=Wolfgang J |authorlink=Wolfgang J. Mommsen |title=Max Weber und die Deutsche Politik 1890–1920 |publisher=J.C.B. Mohr |location=Tübingen |year=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mommsen questioned the sociologist's liberal reputation. According to Mommsen, Weber's sociological idea of [[charismatic authority]] was evident in his political views, and was "close to [[Fascism|fascist]] notions of plebiscitary leadership."&lt;ref name=ref7&gt;{{cite book |last=Mommsen |first=Wolfgang J. |title=The Political and Social Theory of Max Weber |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1989 |isbn=0-226-53400-6 |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mommsen wrote that Weber's theory of democracy "lent itself all too readily to an authoritarian reinterpretation"&lt;ref name="ref7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref19&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roth |first=Guenther |title=Political Critiques of Max Weber: Some Implications for Political Sociology |journal=American Sociological Review|date=April 1965 |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=214, 220n |doi=10.2307/2091565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mommsen also associated Weber with the rise of Hitler: "Weber's teachings concerning [[charismatic leadership]] coupled with the radical formulation of the meaning of democratic institutions, contributed to making the German people inwardly ready to acclaim the leadership position of [[Adolf Hitler]]."&lt;ref name=refa /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref6 /&gt;

Max Weber's call for the democratic reform of the Wilhelmine state, and his involvement in the drafting of the [[Weimar Constitution]], had led German intellectuals in the 1950s to consider him as an authority who could justify the democratic character of the new [[Federal Republic of Germany]].&lt;ref name=refa /&gt; Mommsen's thesis, that Max Weber supported [[parliamentary democracy]] as a means to serve the power interests of the German nation-state, met a sharp response, because, in [[Raymond Aron]]'s words, this removed "the new German democracy of a 'founding father,' a glorious ancestor, and a spokesman of genius."&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

===Politics and sociology===
Weber's political views have been considered to threaten the reputation of his sociology.&lt;ref name="ref19" /&gt; [[Günther Roth]], [[Reinhard Bendix]],  and [[Karl Loewenstein]] have defended Weberian sociology by arguing that it stands separate from his political convictions.&lt;ref name=refa/&gt;&lt;ref name=ref3/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref17&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mommsen |first=Wolfgang J. |title=The Political and Social Thought of Max Weber |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1989 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref17a&gt;{{Cite book |last=Beetham |first=David |title=Max Weber and the Theory of Modern Politics |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |year=1985 |isbn=0-7456-0118-9 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; They consider Weber's distinction between scientific [[value-neutrality]] and evaluative politics to support this claim.&lt;ref name=refa/&gt;&lt;ref name=ref3/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref17/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref17a" /&gt; In their view, Weber's politics should be interpreted as separate from the interpretation of his sociology. This idea was rejected by Mommsen.

Mommsen wrote of continuities between Weber's "value-neutral" sociology and his "evaluative" politics. The second edition of ''Max Weber and German Politics 1890-1920'' argued that "values and [[science]], in Weber's thought, were interdependent." Critics were dismissed as attempting "to shield Max Weber's sociological works against any possible criticism based on political aspects."&lt;ref name=refa/&gt; Günther Roth responded in a 1965 American sociological journal, stating that Weber was a major target for a series of critiques aimed at [[political sociology]] in general, if not at most of [[social science]].&lt;ref name="ref19" /&gt; Roth also stated that Mommsen was removed from the interest of American sociologists in Weber, and his treatment becomes questionable when he interprets Weber's [[sociological analysis]] as [[political ideology]].&lt;ref name="ref19"/&gt; Roth stated that his "major intent" was "not to provide an historical defense of Weber but a review of critiques as they seem to bear on the raison d'etre of [[political sociology]]."&lt;ref name="ref19" /&gt; He claimed that Weber "must appear [[relativist]] and [[Machiavellian]] to all those who, for ideological reasons, cannot recognize any dividing line between [[political sociology]] and [[political ideology]]. Weber emphatically insisted on such a distinction, while his critics refuse to distinguish between his [[scholarship]] and his [[politics]]."&lt;ref name="ref19" /&gt;

[[Raymond Aron]] did not consider Weber's sociology to stand above politics. He viewed Weber, in both politics and sociology, to be a typical "power-politician."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Aron |first=Raymond |title="Max Weber and power-politics," Max Weber and Sociology Today, Otto Stammer, editor |publisher=Harper and Row |location=New York  |year=1971 |pages=94–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aron wrote in 1971 that Weber "belongs to the posterity of [[Machiavelli]] as much as to the contemporaries of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]," and that "the struggle for power between classes and individuals" seemed to Weber as the "essence" of politics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Aron |first=Raymond |title="Max Weber and power-politics," Max Weber and Sociology Today, Otto Stammer, editor |publisher=Harper and Row |location=New York  |year=1971 |pages=94–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of '''land reform in Ethiopia''' has hampered that country's [[economic development]] throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries. Attempts to modernize land ownership by giving title either to the [[peasant]]s who till the soil, or to large-scale farming programs, have been tried under imperial rulers like Emperor [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]], and under [[Marxism|Marxist]] regimes like the [[Derg]], with mixed results. The [[1995 Constitution of Ethiopia|present Constitution of Ethiopia]], which was put into force January 1995, vests land ownership exclusively "in the State and in the
peoples of Ethiopia." The relevant section continues, "Land is a common property of the Nations, Nationalities and Peoples of Ethiopia and shall not be subject to sale or to other means of exchange."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/et00000_.html Constitution of Ethiopia], Article 40&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these different approaches to [[land reform]], Ethiopia still faces issues of sustainable food self-sufficiency.

== Background ==
Prior to the 1974 Ethiopian Revolution, Ethiopia had a complex [[land tenure]] system. In [[Wollo|Wollo Province]], for example, there were an estimated 111 types of land tenure. The existence of so many land tenure systems, coupled with the lack of reliable data, has made it difficult to give a comprehensive assessment of landownership in Ethiopia. However, the tenure system can be understood in a rudimentary way if one examines it in the context of the basic distinction between landownership patterns in the north and those in the south.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;Wubne, Mulatu. "Agriculture" (and subsections). ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ettoc.html A Country Study: Ethiopia]'' (Thomas P. Ofcansky and LaVerle Berry, eds.) [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (1991). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/about.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, Ethiopia was divided into the [[Ethiopian Highlands|northern highlands]], which constituted the core of the old Christian kingdom, and the southern highlands, most of which were brought under imperial rule by conquest. This north-south distinction was reflected in land tenure differences. In the northern regions—particularly [[Gojjam]], [[Begemder]] and Semien (called Gondar after 1974), Tigray, highland Eritrea, parts of Wollo, and northern [[Shewa]]—the major form of ownership was a type of communal system known as ''[[Rist (tenure)|rist]]''. According to this system, all descendants (both male and female) of an individual founder were entitled to a share, and individuals had the right to use (a [[usufruct]] right) a plot of family land. ''Rist'' was hereditary, inalienable, and inviolable. No user of any piece of land could sell his or her share outside the family or mortgage or bequeath his or her share as a gift, as the land belonged not to the individual but to the descent group. Most [[peasant]]s in the northern highlands held at least some ''rist'' land, but there were some members belonging to minority ethnic groups who were tenant farmers.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The other major form of tenure was ''[[gult]]'', an ownership right acquired from the monarch or from provincial rulers who were empowered to make land grants. ''Gult'' owners collected tribute from the peasantry and, until 1966 (when ''gult'' rights were abolished in principle), exacted labor service as payment in kind from the peasants. Until the government instituted salaries in the twentieth century, ''gult'' rights were the typical form of compensation for an official.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Other forms of tenure included ''samon'', ''mengist'', and ''maderia'' land. ''Samon'' was land the government had granted to the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] in perpetuity. Traditionally, the church had claimed about one-third of Ethiopia's land; however, actual ownership probably never reached this figure. Estimates of church holdings range from 10 - 20% of the country's cultivated land. Peasants who worked on church land paid tribute to the church (or monastery) rather than to the emperor. The state owned large tracts of agricultural land known as ''mengist'' and ''maderia''. ''Mengist'' was land registered as government property, and ''maderia'' was land granted mainly to government officials, war veterans, and other patriots in lieu of a pension or salary. Although it granted ''maderia'' land for life, the state possessed a reversionary right over all land grants; this form of tenure comprised about 12% of the country's agricultural land.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; ''Maderia'' tenure became a far more common  following the [[Second World War]], as Emperor [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] used it to reward the ''[[arbegnoch]]'' (or "Patriots") who had fought the [[Italian East Africa|Italian occupiers]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmund J. Keller, ''Revolutionary Ethiopia'' (Bloomington: Indiana University, 1988), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, absentee landlordism in the north was rare, and landless tenants were few. For instance, tenancy in Begemder and Semien and in Gojjam was estimated at about 2% of holdings. In the southern provinces, however, few farmers owned the land on which they worked. Southern landownership patterns developed as a result of [[land measurement]] and land grants following the Ethiopian conquest of the region in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. After the conquest, officials divided southern land equally among the state, the church, and the indigenous population. Warlords who administered the occupied regions received the state's share. They, in turn, redistributed part of their share to their officers and soldiers. The government distributed the church's share among the church hierarchy in the same manner. Officials divided the rest between the traditional leaders ([[balabat]]s) and the indigenous people. Thus, the loss of two-thirds of the land to the new landlords and the church made many local people tenants (gebbars). Tenancy in the southern provinces ranged between 65% and 80% of the holdings, and tenant payments to landowners averaged as high as 50% of the produce.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

In the lowland periphery and the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]], the traditional practice of transhumance and the allocation of pastoral land according to tribal custom remained undisturbed until after World War II. These two areas are inhabited by pastoralists, including the [[Afar people|Afar]] and [[Issa (clan)|Issa]] in eastern Eritrea, Wollo, and [[Hararghe]]; the [[Somali people|Somali]] in the Ogaden; the [[Borana Oromo people|Borana]] in Sidamo and Bale; and the [[Karayu Oromo|Karayu]] in the Great Rift Valley area of [[Shewa]]. The pastoral social structure is based on a kinship system with strong interclan connections; grazing and water rights are regulated by custom.

== Landownership under Haile Selassie up to the Revolution ==
Until the 1950s, this pastoral life remained largely undisturbed by the highlanders, who intensely disliked the hot and humid lowland climate and feared [[malaria]]. Beginning in the 1950s, however, the malaria eradication programs made irrigation agriculture in these areas possible. The government's desire to promote such agriculture, combined with its policy of creating new tax revenues, put pressure on many pastoralists, especially the Afar and the [[Arsi Oromo]]. Major concessionaires, such as the [[Tendaho Cotton Plantation]] (managed until the 1974 revolution by the British firm [[Mitchell Cotts]]) and the [[Wonji Sugar Plantation]] (managed by HVA, a Dutch company), was granted large tracts of traditional Afar and Arsi grazing land and converted them into large-scale commercial farms. The loss of grazing land to these concessions significantly affected traditional migration patterns for grazing and water.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

In the northern and southern parts of Ethiopia, peasant farmers lacked the means to improve production because of the fragmentation of holdings, a lack of credit, and the absence of modern facilities. Particularly in the south, the insecurity of tenure and high rents killed the peasants' incentive to improve production.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; Further, those attempts by the Imperial government to improve the peasant's title to their land were often met with suspicion. One example was the 1968 Gojjam revolt, where the peasants successfully resisted government efforts to survey their lands, believing that it would increase the taxes levied by local corrupt officials.&lt;ref&gt;Bahru Zewde, ''A History of Modern Ethiopia'', second edition (London: James Currey, 2001), pp. 216ff, and Gebru Tareke, ''Ethiopia: Power and Protest'' (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1996), pp. 160-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1960s, many sectors of Ethiopian society favored land reform. University students led the land reform movement and campaigned against the government's reluctance to introduce land reform programs and the lack of commitment to integrated rural development. By 1974 it was clear that the archaic land tenure system was one of the major factors responsible for the backward condition of Ethiopia's agriculture and the onset of the revolution. On March 4, 1975, the [[Derg]] announced its land reform program. The government nationalized rural land without compensation, abolished tenancy, forbade the hiring of wage labor on private farms, ordered all commercial farms to remain under state control, and granted each peasant family so-called "possessing rights" to a plot of land not to exceed ten hectares. The Ethiopian Church lost all its land, and its clergy and lay people had to rely on stipends from the Derg to live.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Tenant farmers in southern Ethiopia, where the average tenancy was as high as 55% and rural elites exploited farmers, welcomed the land reform. But in the northern highlands, where ''rist'' tenures dominated and large holdings and tenancy were exceptions, many people resisted land reform. Despite the special provision for communal areas (Article 19 of the proclamation gave peasants in the communal areas "possessing rights" to the land they were tilling at the time of the proclamation) and the Derg's efforts to reassure farmers that land reform would not affect them negatively, northerners remained suspicious of the new government's intentions. The reform held no promise of gain for most northerners; rather, many northern farmers perceived land reform as an attack on their rights to ''rist'' land. Resistance intensified when ''Zemecha'' members campaigned for collectivization of land and oxen.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Land reform had the least impact on the lowland peripheries, where nomads traditionally maintained their claims over grazing lands. The new proclamation gave them rights of possession to land they used for grazing. Therefore, the nomads did not perceive the new program as a threat. However, in the Afar area of the lower Awash Valley, where large-scale commercial estates had thrived, there was opposition to land reform, led mainly by tribal leaders (and large landowners), such as [[Alimirah Hanfadhe]] the [[Aussa Sultanate|Sultan of Aussa]].&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The land reform destroyed the feudal order; changed landowning patterns, particularly in the south, in favor of peasants and small landowners; and provided the opportunity for peasants to participate in local matters by permitting them to form associations. However, problems associated with declining agricultural productivity and poor farming techniques still were prevalent.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Government attempts to implement land reform also created problems related to land fragmentation, insecurity of tenure and former tenants, and shortages of farm inputs and tools. Peasant associations often were periodically compelled to redistribute land to accommodate young families or new households moving into their area. The process meant not only smaller farms but also the fragmentation of holdings, which were often scattered into small plots to give families land of comparable quality. Consequently, individual holdings were frequently far smaller than the permitted maximum allotment of ten hectares. A 1979 study showed that around [[Addis Ababa]] individual holdings ranged from 1.0 to 1.6 hectares and that about 48 percent of the parcels were less than one-fourth of a hectare in size. Another study, of Dejen ''awraja'' (subregion) in Gojjam, found that land fragmentation had been exacerbated since the revolution. For example, during the pre-reform period, sixty-one out of 200 farmer respondents owned three or four parcels of land; after the reform, the corresponding number was 135 farmers.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;
The insecurity of the tenants was the most prevalent problem especially in areas where few strong landlords dominate both the political and economic environments of the region. In some areas such as Gojam and Begemidir (later called Gondar), where there was strongholds of Orthodox Church and royal landlords,the tenants who got plots of land were attacked by the landlord families. Those tenants who got new farmlands were secretly submitting gifts to landlord family and the church until some measurements were taken by the regime. Some farmers such as handcraft workers who fear the hidden bitter hands of the former landlords fled to the nearby towns;others made a deal with their former landlords and employers.

The second problem related to security of tenure, which was threatened by increasing pressure to redistribute land and to collectivize farms. Many peasants were reluctant to improve their land because they were afraid that they would not receive adequate compensation for upgrades. The third problem developed as a result of the military government's failure to provide farmers with basic items like seeds, oxen, and fertilizer. For instance, one study of four communities in different parts of Ethiopia found that up to 50 percent of the peasants in some areas lacked oxen and about 40 percent did not have plows.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

==Government Rural Programs==
In 1984 the founding congress of the [[Workers' Party of Ethiopia]] emphasized the need for a coordinated strategy based on socialist principles to accelerate agricultural development. To implement this strategy, the government relied on peasant associations and rural development, cooperatives and state farms, resettlement and villagization, increased food production, and a new marketing policy.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

===Peasant Associations and Rural Development===
Articles 8 and 10 of the 1975 Land Reform Proclamation required that peasants be organized into a hierarchy of associations that would facilitate the implementation of rural development programs and policies. Accordingly, after the land reform announcement, the government mobilized more than 60,000 students to organize peasants into associations. By the end of 1987, there were 20,367 peasant associations with a membership of 5.7 million farmers. Each association covered an area of 800 hectares, and members included tenants, landless laborers, and landowners holding fewer than ten hectares. Former landowners who had held more than ten hectares of land could join an association only after the completion of land redistribution. An umbrella organization known as the [[All-Ethiopia Peasants' Association]] represented local associations. Peasant associations assumed a wide range of responsibilities, including implementation of government land use directives; adjudication of land disputes; encouragement of development programs, such as water and land conservation; construction of schools, clinics, and cooperatives; organization of defense squads; and tax collection. Peasant associations also became involved in organizing forestry programs, local service and production cooperatives, road construction, and data collection projects, such as the 1984 census.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

===Cooperatives and State Farms===

Starting in 1976, the government encouraged farmers to form [[agricultural cooperative|cooperatives]]. Between 1978 and 1981, the Derg issued a series of proclamations and directives outlining procedures for the formation of service cooperatives and producers' cooperatives. Service cooperatives provided basic services, such as the sale of farm inputs and consumer items that were often rationed, the provision of loans, the education of peasant association members in socialist philosophy, and the promotion of cottage industries.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The producers' cooperatives alleviated shortages of inputs (because farmers could pool resources) and problems associated with the fragmentation of landholdings. The government ordered the creation of these cooperatives because of its belief that small farmers were inefficient and were unable to take advantage of economies of scale.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The producers' cooperatives developed in three stages. The first stage was the ''melba'', an elementary type of cooperative that required members to pool land (with the exception of plots of up to 2,000 square meters, which could be set aside for private use) and to share oxen and farm implements. The second stage, ''welba'', required members to transfer their resources to the cooperative and reduce private plots to 1,000 square meters. The third stage, the ''weland'', abolished private land use and established advanced forms of cooperatives, whose goal was to use mechanized farming with members organized into production brigades. Under this system, income would be distributed based on labor contributions.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The government provided a number of inducements to producers' cooperatives, including priority for credits, fertilizers, improved seed, and access to consumer items and building materials. According to the ten-year plan, more than half of the country's cultivated land would be organized into producers' cooperatives by 1994. Despite the incentives, farmers responded less than enthusiastically. They saw the move to form cooperatives as a prelude to the destruction of their "family farms." By 1985/86 there were only 2,323 producers' cooperatives, of which only 255 were registered. Some critics argued that the resistance of farmers caused the government to formulate its resettlement and villagization programs.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

A major component of the Derg's agricultural policy was the development of large-scale [[collective farming|state farms]]. Following the 1975 land reform, the Derg converted a majority of the estimated 75,000 hectares of large, commercial farms owned by individuals and cooperatives into state farms; not long afterwards, the government expanded their size. By 1987/88 there were about 216,000 hectares of state farmland, accounting for 3.3% of the total cultivated area. The ten-year plan indicated that state farms would be expanded to 468,000 hectares by 1994, accounting for 6.4% of the cultivated land.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The primary motive for the expansion of state farms was the desire to reverse the drop in food production that has continued since the revolution. After the 1975 land reform, peasants began withholding grain from the market to drive up prices because government price-control measures had created shortages of consumer items such as coffee, cooking oil, salt, and sugar. Additionally, increased peasant consumption caused shortages of food items such as [[teff]], wheat, corn, and other grains in urban areas. The problem became so serious that [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]], the chairman of the Derg, lashed out against the peasantry on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of military rule in September 1978, criticizing them for their capitalist mentality and their [[petit bourgeois]] tendencies. Mengistu and his advisers believed that state farms would produce grain for urban areas and raw materials for domestic industry and would also increase production of cash crops such as coffee to generate badly needed foreign exchange. Accordingly, state farms received a large share of the country's resources for agriculture; from 1982 to 1990, this totaled about 43% of the government's agricultural investment. In 1983 state farms received 76% of the total allocation of chemical fertilizers, 95% of the improved seeds, and 81% of agricultural credit. In terms of subsidies, between 1982/83 and 1985/86 the various state farm corporations received more than 90 million [[Ethiopian birr|Birr]] in direct subsidies. Despite the emphasis on state farms, state farm production accounted for only 6% of total agricultural output in 1987 (although meeting 65% of urban needs), leaving peasant farmers responsible for over 90% of production.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

===Resettlement and villagization===
{{main|Resettlement and villagization in Ethiopia}}
The policy of encouraging voluntary resettlement went back to 1958, when the government established the first known planned resettlement in [[Sidamo Province|Sidamo]]. Shortly after the 1974 revolution, it became Derg policy to accelerate resettlement. By 1986 the government had resettled more than 600,000 people to three settlement areas. After a brief halt to the program in response to international pressure, the program resumed in 1987. Western donors and governments expressed fears that the resettlement plans would strain the country's finances, would depopulate areas of resistance, would weaken the guerrillas' support base and deny them access to recruits, would violate [[Human rights in Ethiopia|human rights]] through lack of medical attention. Although many of these charges were valid, some criticisms may have been unfounded.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

In 1985 the government initiated a new relocation program known as "villagization". The objectives of the program, which grouped scattered farming communities throughout the country into small village clusters, were to promote rational land use; conserve resources; provide access to clean water and to health and education services; and strengthen security. Government guidelines stipulated that villages were to house 200 to 300 households. By March 1986, about 4.6 million people in Shewa, Arsi, and Harerge had been relocated into more than 4,500 villages. Although the government had villagized about 13 million people by 1989, international criticism, deteriorating security conditions, and lack of resources doomed the plan to failure.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Opponents of villagization argued that the scheme was disruptive to agricultural production because the government moved many farmers during the planting and harvesting seasons. There also was concern that villagization could have a negative impact on fragile local resources, particularly on water and grazing land; accelerate the spread of communicable diseases; and increase problems with plant pests and diseases. In early 1990, the government essentially abandoned villagization when it announced new economic policies that called for free-market reforms and a relaxation of centralized planning.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

'''Lithuanian–Polish Peace Force Battalion''' or '''LITPOLBAT''' ({{lang-pl|Litewsko-Polski Batalion Sił Pokojowych}}) was a [[Lithuania]]n–[[Poland|Polish]] [[peacekeeping]] [[battalion]], formed in 1997 and disbanded in 2007 as one of the examples of military cooperation between Lithuania and Poland, now both members of [[NATO]]. Soldiers of the battalion served in various peacekeeping missions of the [[United Nations]], NATO and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]. Soldiers of LITPOLBAT have been deployed in [[Kosovo]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Iraq]].

==History==
[[Polish–Lithuanian relations|Polish–Lithuanian foreign relations]] were established in 1991. Origins of the military cooperation that led to the unit's creation can be traced to an agreement on the establishment of mutual military cooperation between Poland and Lithuania. That agreement was signed by those countries respective defense ministries (the Ministry of National Defense of Republic of Poland and the Ministry of National Protection of the Lithuanian Republic) on June 15, 1993 in Vilnius. Since it was signed, various joint training exercises have taken place at the squad and platoon level between [[Polish military|Polish]] and [[Military of Lithuania|Lithuanian military]]. Poland has also assisted Lithuanian military by donating equipment worth over one million [[US dollars]] and assisting with training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lfpr.lt/uploads/File/2001-7/Krivas.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927162343/http://www.lfpr.lt/uploads/File/2001-7/Krivas.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creation of such specific unit was first proposed by [[President of Lithuania]], [[Algirdas Brazauskas]], during his speech in Polish parliament ([[Sejm]]) in 1995. The unit was officially created on March 3, 1997 when a specific agreement was reached by [[Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Lithuania)|its Lithuanian counterpart]]. On December 31, 1998 the battalion reached operational readiness. 

During a visit of the [[President of Poland]] [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]] to Lithuania on April 14, 1999, LITPOLBAT was presented with two [[military standard]]s, Polish and Lithuanian one, financed by presidents of both countries. In 2000 LITPOLBAT became part of the European Union's Rapid reaction force.

In 1999 Poland joined NATO and has since then been supporting Lithuanian entry into that organization; Lithuania joined NATO in 2004. On February 5, 2001 a new agreement of cooperation on the issue of defence was signed between the Government of Poland and the Government of Lithuania reflecting their new NATO-related closer cooperation.

In 2007 the battalion was disbanded. However, from 2008-9 a new formation, the [[Lithuanian–Polish–Ukrainian Brigade]] (LITPOLUKRBRIG), has been proposed to continue and expand the same type of regional combined force.

==Organization==

Polish units of LITPOLBAT came from [[4 Suwałki Armored Cavalry Brigade]] named after General [[Zygmunt Podhorski]] in [[Orzysz]], part of [[Warmia]]–[[Mazury]] [[Polish 15th Mechanized Division]] named after king of Poland and Lithuania, [[Jogaila]]. Lithuanian units come from [[Mechanized Infantry Battalion]] in [[Alytus]], named after Great Lithuanian Duchess [[Birutė]], part of [[Iron Wolf Mechanised Infantry Brigade]] in Vilnius.

Nearly 800 soldiers served in the battalion (435 Poles and 351 Lithuanians). NATO press release from 2004 gave the strength of 784.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/invitees2004/lithuania/defence.htm 7 Invitees - Lithuania]&lt;/ref&gt; The key staff positions are taken up by rotation. The commander of the unit served for 3 years.

The bilaterally staffed Battalion Headquarters were located in Orzysz, Poland.

'''Maximilian III Joseph''' (28 March 1727 – 30 December 1777) was a [[Prince-elector]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and Duke of [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]] from 1745 to 1777.

==Biography==

[[File:Thaler du duché de Bavière à l'effigie de Maximilien III Joseph, 1761.jpg|thumb|Maximilian III Joseph, 1761]]

Born in [[Munich]], Maximilian was the eldest son of [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles VII]] and his wife, [[Maria Amalia of Austria]], daughter of [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I]].
[[Image:Max III Joseph als Prinz.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Maximilian Joseph as electoral prince]]
Upon his father's death in January 1745, he inherited a country in the process of being invaded by [[Austria]]n armies (see [[War of the Austrian Succession]]). The 18-year-old Maximilian Joseph wavered between the ''Peace-party'', led by his mother Maria Amalia of Austria and Army Commander [[Friedrich Heinrich von Seckendorff]] and the ''War-party'', led by Foreign Minister General Ignaz Count of Törring and the French envoy Chavigny. After the decisive defeat in the [[Battle of Pfaffenhofen]] on 15 April Maximilian Joseph quickly abandoned his father's imperial pretenses and made peace with [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] in the [[Treaty of Füssen]], in which he agreed to support her husband, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Grand Duke Francis Stephen of Tuscany]], in the upcoming imperial election. During the [[Seven Years' War]] Bavarian forces then fought on the Habsburg side. Maximilian Joseph's sister [[Maria Josepha of Bavaria]] was married in 1765 to Maria Theresa's son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]]. But long-term weakening of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] was not in the Bavarian interest, as that country offered the only counterweight to the Habsburg monarchy. Maximilian Joseph tried, as far as possible, to keep Bavaria out of the wars. Apart from militia troops, he sent only a small force of 4,000 men to join the Austrian army. In 1758/1759 (only a year and half into the war), he withdrew Bavarian auxiliary troops from Austrian service. Together with the Wittelsbach Elector [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Charles Theodore]] of the Palatinate he enforced the neutrality of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] during the conflict.

Maximilian Joseph was a progressive and [[Enlightened absolutism|enlightened ruler]] who did much to improve the development of his country. He encouraged agriculture, industry, and exploitation of the mineral wealth of the country, and abolished the [[Jesuit]] censorship of the press. In 1747 the [[Nymphenburg Porcelain Factory]] was established, while the ''[[Codex Maximilianeus bavaricus civilis]]'' was written in 1756. In 1759, he founded Munich's first academic institution, the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences]]. During the severe famine in 1770 Maximilian sold some of the crown jewels to pay for grain imports to relieve hunger. In that year, he also issued an edict against the extravagant pomposity of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] which contributed to the end of the era of Bavarian [[rococo]]. He also forbade the [[Oberammergau Passion Play]]. In 1771 the elector regulated general school attendance.

In December 1777 Maximilian Joseph rode in his carriage through Munich; on the ride, as he passed one of the tower clocks, the mechanism broke, and the clock struck 77 times. Commenting to the passengers, Max Joseph decided this was an omen, and that his years had run out.  Within days, he was stricken with a strange disease. None of his 15 doctors could diagnose it, but by Christmas, it had become clear that it was a particularly virulent strain of [[smallpox]], called "purple small pox" at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Bernard. ''Joseph II and Bavaria: Two Eighteenth Century Attempts at German Unification.'' Hague: Martin Nijoff, 1965, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the last day of the month he was dead without leaving an heir. Maximilian III Joseph is buried in the crypt of the [[Theatinerkirche (München)|Theatinerkirche]] in Munich.

==Succession==
As the last of the [[Treaty of Pavia (1329)|junior branch of the Wittelsbach dynasty]] which derived from [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] and had ruled Bavaria since early 14th century, Maximilian's death led to a succession dispute and the brief [[War of the Bavarian Succession]]. He was succeeded by his distant cousin, the [[Elector Palatine]] [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Charles Theodore]] from the senior branch of the dynasty. Maximilian's widow [[Maria Anna Sophia of Saxony]] and Maximilian's sister [[Duchess Maria Antonia of Bavaria]] as well as Maria Anna of Palatinate-Sulzbach, the widow of the former Bavarian crown prince [[Duke Clement Francis of Bavaria]] negotiated with Prussia to secure Bavaria's independence from Austria, which had invaded portions of the duchy immediately after the Elector's death.&lt;ref&gt;Germany, German guide-books, CUP Archive, 1931, pg.

Maximilian III Joseph ordered in 1751 [[François de Cuvilles|François de Cuvilliés]] to construct the splendid [[rococo]] [[Cuvilliés Theatre]] and in 1755 the ''Stone Hall'' of  [[Nymphenburg Palace]]. He also ordered to decorate some rooms of the [[Schleissheim Palace|New Schleissheim Palace]] in rococo style.

[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was received by Maximilian III Joseph, who was like his sister [[Maria Antonia Walpurgis of Bavaria]] skilled in music and composed, but due to a need for strict frugality no post could be offered. In 1775 ''[[La finta giardiniera]]'', an Italian opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, received its first performance at the Salvatortheater in Munich.

In 1770 Maximilian III Joseph established the precursor of the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts]] in Munich.

{{Neo-fascism}}
'''National Rebirth of Poland''' ({{lang-pl|Narodowe Odrodzenie Polski}}), abbreviated to '''NOP''', is an [[Ultranationalism|ultranationalist]], [[far-right]], [[Neofascism|neofascist]] and national-revolutionary (or [[Third Position]]) [[List of political parties in Poland|political party]] in [[Poland]] registered by the District Court in Warsaw and National Electoral Commission. As of the [[Polish parliamentary election, 2015|2015 election]], the party had no seats in the [[Parliament of Poland|Polish parliament]]. It was a member of the [[European National Front]].

==History and politics==
[[Image:NOP fascism.jpg|thumb|right|250px|To gain media attention NOP often runs [[shock value]] campaigns. During the 2007 Sejm and Senate elections NOP disseminated poster with slogan – ''Fascism? We are worse!'']]
National Rebirth of Poland was founded as a nationalist discussion group for young people on 10 November 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Revolutionary and Dissident Movements of the World |last=Szajkowski |first=Bogdan |year=2004 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=978-0-9543811-2-7 |page=409 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ncoZAQAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; It joined the [[Christian National Union]] when that party was founded in 1989, before leaving in February 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Handbook of Political Change in Eastern Europe |last=Berglund |first=Sten |author2=Ekman, Joakim |author3=Aarebrot, Frank H.  |year=2004 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-84064-854-6 |page=184 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HeRzzwzdfPkC }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NOP registered as a political party in 1992. The party is the only far-right organisation to claim to be a successor to the [[National Radical Camp Falanga]] (RNR),&lt;ref&gt;Borejsza et al (2006), p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; the pre-war nationalist youth organisation, which was banned in 1934.&lt;ref name="shafir"&gt;[http://web.ceu.hu/jewishstudies/yb03/16shafir.pdf Michael Shafir Varieties of Antisemitism in Post-communist East Central Europe: Motivations and Political Discourse]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafal Pankowski and Marcin Kornak. [https://books.google.com/books?id=YB-ZwiBf5HgC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=%22Narodowe+Odrodzenie+Polski%22&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;num=20&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=F14oSY--GojWNrev3ZgC#PPA161,M1 ''Poland''.] Racist Extremism in Central and Eastern Europe, Cas Mudde (Editor), pp. 156–183. [[Routledge]], 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-415-35593-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NOP publishes the magazines ''Szczerbiec'' (the name of the [[Szczerbiec|Polish royal coronation sword]]), which lists neofascists [[Derek Holland (activist)|Derek Holland]] and [[Roberto Fiore]] among the members of its editorial board,&lt;ref name="shafir" /&gt; ''Młodzież Narodowa'' (''National Youth''), ''Myśl'' (''The Thought''), and ''17 – Cywilizacja Czasów Próby'' (''17 – The Civilization of the Times of Trial'').

In 2009, NOP membership in Poland was estimated at 1000. NOP also has supporters outside Poland, notably among the [[Polish American]] community, including Polish Patriots’ Association residing in [[New York City]], and the revisionist Polish Historical Institute in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2001-2/poland.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404043228/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2001-2/poland.htm |date=April 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the NOP tried to enter parliamentary politics for the first time. The newly created NOP front organization, the [[New Forces Alliance]] (''Sojusz Nowych Sił''), joined the nationalist electoral bloc, [[Alternative Social Movement]] (''Alternatywa Ruch Społeczny''). Among the NOP candidates were [[Marcin Radzewicz (NOP)|Marcin Radzewicz]], the leader of the openly [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] [[National Socialist Front (Poland)|National Socialist Front]] (''Front Narodowo-Socjalistyczny''). ARS gained just below 0.5% of the votes, and the alliance was dissolved.&lt;ref name="Cas"&gt;{{cite book | author = Cas Mudde | authorlink=Cas Mudde | title = Racist Extremism in Central and Eastern Europe | year =2005 | publisher = [[Routledge]]| location =London | isbn=0-415-35593-1 | oclc =55228719 | url = | page = 162 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Polish parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary elections]], the NOP received 0.06% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wybory2005.pkw.gov.pl/SJM/EN/WYN/W/index.htm Elections 2005] on ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'' website (en)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2006 self-government regional elections, it received 0.30%, or about 41&amp;nbsp;000 votes. In the 2007 parliamentary election, the NOP received 42&amp;nbsp;407 votes in four electoral districts. In the self-government regional elections in 2010, the party received 0.24% of the vote.

In the [[Polish parliamentary election, 2011|2011 parliamentary elections]], NOP senate candidate Anetta Stemler, running in the 1st electoral district, received 2934 votes, or 3.10%.

The NOP is known for trying to get media attention with its [[shock value]] campaigns.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.wiadomosci24.pl/artykul/wyborczy_slogan_nop_u_jestesmy_gorsi_od_faszyzmu_44429.html Wyborczy slogan NOP-u: "Jesteśmy gorsi od faszyzmu" – Wiadomości24&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Polish parliamentary election, 2007|2007 parliamentary election]], the NOP distributed election campaign posters with the slogan "Fascism? We are worse."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Another, openly [[homophobic]] shock value campaign conducted by the NOP was called ''Zakaz Pedałowania'' (''Faggotry Forbidden'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nop.org.pl/?artykul_id=144 « Zakaz Pedałowania »] on NOP's website (pl)&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 May 2006 in [[Toruń]], the NOP organized a counter-demonstration against a public [[LGBT]] rights supporters' meeting. NOP members chanted slogans, including "gas the queers" (pedały do gazu) and "there will be a baton for each queer face" (znajdzie się kij na pedalski ryj).&lt;ref&gt;http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session1/PL/AI_POL_UPR_S1_2008anx_EUR%2001_017_2006.pdf [[United Nations Human Rights Council]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://amnesty.org.pl/archiwum/aktualnosci-strona-artykulu/article/4969/71/category/6/neste/1.html?cHash=adf146462f [[Amnesty International]] Polska&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antisemitism and racism==

The NOP is stated to be an [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] organisation by a number of [[government bodies]], [[nongovernmental organizations]], academic institutions and individual experts worldwide, such as the [[United States Department of State]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78832.htm Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2006], [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] US State Dept.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90193.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007] US State Dept.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] (ECRI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session1/PL/CE_POL_UPR_S1_2008anx_ECRIThirdReportdated071204.pdf European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) Third report on Poland Adopted on 17 December 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism]], the NOP is promoting violent forms of [[neo-fascism]] and antisemitism, including [[Holocaust denial]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2006/poland.htm Poland 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520142341/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2006/poland.htm |date=2008-05-20 }}, by [[Stephen Roth Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the British historian, [[John Pollard (historian)|Dr John Pollard]], [[neo-Nazi]] elements in the NOP and their racism and homophobia continue to give rise to concern in other member countries of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Pollard (historian)|John Pollard]] ''‘Clerical Fascism’: Context, Overview and Conclusion'' in: Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions, Vol. 8, No. 2, p. 11, June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
NOP actions were also condemned by the [[Anti-Defamation League]], which claims that the NOP is an openly anti-Semitic [[extremist]] organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/international/PolandDemocracyandExtremism.pdf Poland: Democracy and the Challenge of Extremism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001193732/http://www.adl.org/international/PolandDemocracyandExtremism.pdf |date=2008-10-01 }}, by [[Anti-Defamation League]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; According to the magazine ''[[Warsaw Voice|The Warsaw voice]]'', the manifesto of the National Revival of Poland, which contains a sentence stating that "Jews will be removed from Poland, and their possessions will be confiscated", is taken directly from [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.&lt;ref name="voice"&gt;[http://www.warsawvoice.pl/view/3096/ RACE: Fighting Fascism], Warsaw Voice, 31 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine also claims that the official greeting gesture used in the party is the Nazi-like gesture of the raised arm.&lt;ref name="voice"/&gt;

A number of NOP-related incidents received some media coverage in Poland and abroad. According to the [[European Roma Rights Centre]], on July 3, 1998, NOP supporters vandalised the [[Romani people|Roma]] community centre in [[Łódź]]. Along with racist graffiti, [[swastika]]s were sprayed onto the office walls. The perpetrators also left behind their signature as NOP – Narodowe Odrodzenie Polski. During the same night, the same group reportedly vandalised the premises of the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] religious group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=88 European Roma Rights Centre&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2000, in [[Łódź]], swastikas and the slogan "Jews out!" along with NOP symbols were spray-painted on the home of [[Marek Edelman]], who was the deputy commander in the [[Warsaw Ghetto uprising]] and the last of the leaders of the uprising still alive. The incident was condemned by the president and prime minister of Poland, who sent Edelman letters of support and apology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Anti-Semitism+and+the+Holocaust/Antisemitism+Monitoring+Forum/Anti-Semitic+Incidents+-+March+2000.htm Anti-Semitic Incidents – March 2000], by the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;

NOP [[front organization]] National-Radical Institute (''Instytut Narodowo-Radykalny'', INR) was involved in publishing Western and Polish Holocaust denial literature. In 1997, INR published a volume of translated works of Western Holocaust deniers under the title ''The Myth of the Holocaust''.&lt;ref name="shafir"/&gt; The same year, INR announced that there were no exterminations in [[gas chambers]] at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] concentration camp.&lt;ref name="shafir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kwiet"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kwiet|first=Konrad|author2=Jürgen Matthäus|title=Contemporary Responses to the Holocaust|publisher=Greenwood Publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-275-97466-9|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the NOP was involved in campaigning to free convicted British [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]] [[David Irving]] from prison in [[Austria]], and produced a poster containing the slogan "David Irving – Uwolnić prawdę" ("David Irving – Free the truth".&lt;ref name="davidirvingsupport"&gt;http://www.nop.org.pl/img/irving.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;)

The party also expressed support for the bombing of [[Israel]] at the time of the [[2006 Lebanon War|2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]], with a poster image stating, "Bomby na Izrael – Już czas !!!" ("Bombs against Israel – it's about time!!!").&lt;ref name="bombyizrael"&gt;http://www.nop.org.pl/img/bomby.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; On August 13, 2006, NOP leader [[Adam Gmurczyk]] published a declaration on behalf of the NOP Executive Council titled ''Izrael musi zostać zniszczony!'' (''Israel must be destroyed!''), calling for the international military takeover of Israel, and offering to put administrative control of [[Jerusalem]] in the hands of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] and his successors.&lt;ref name="gmurczykizraelniszc"&gt;[http://www.nop.org.pl/?artykul_id=419 Narodowe Odrodzenie Polski, Izrael musi zostać zniszczony!]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 2007, in [[Kraków]], antisemitic slogans were shouted and fascist-like gestures made by the participants of an NOP demonstration. Investigations by the Public Prosecutor's Office were discontinued on November 26, 2007, as no perpetrators were identified and the case was not classified as an offense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=30907&amp;contentname=Anti-Semitic%20Incidents%20In%20Poland&amp;sectionid=20&amp;mode=a&amp;recnum=0 « Anti-Semitic Incidents In Poland »], ''[[The Jewish Press]]'', March 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election results==

===Elections===
In 2001, the NOP tried to enter parliamentary politics for the first time. The newly created NOP front organization, the New Forces Alliance (Sojusz Nowych Sił), joined the nationalist electoral bloc, Alternative Social Movement (Alternatywa Ruch Społeczny). Among the NOP candidates were Marcin Radzewicz, the leader of the openly neo-Nazi National Socialist Front (Front Narodowo-Socjalistyczny). ARS gained just below 0.5% of the votes, and the alliance was dissolved.

In the 2005 parliamentary elections, the NOP received 0.06% of the vote. In the 2006 self-government regional elections, it received 0.30%, or about 41 000 votes. In the 2007 parliamentary election, the NOP received 42 407 votes in four electoral districts. In the self-government regional elections in 2010, the party received 0.24% of the vote.

In the 2011 parliamentary elections, NOP senate candidate Anetta Stemler, running in the 1st electoral district, received 2934 votes, or 3.10%. She failed to win the Senate seat. After the 2011 parliamentary elections, NOP did not take part in any further elections; be it to Sejm, Senate or even local.

'''Occupation of factories''' is a method of the [[workers' movement]] used to prevent [[lock out]]s. They may sometimes lead to "recovered factories", in which the [[workers' self-management|workers self-manage]] the [[factories]].

They have been used in many [[strike action]]s, including:

*the 1920–22 ''[[Biennio rosso|Biennio Rosso]]'' (in particular the [[Turin factory occupation of 1920]])
*[[1936 French general strike]] (see [[1936 Matignon agreements]])
*in the [[May 68 revolts]], supported by the [[Council for Maintaining the Occupations]]
*in the 1970s in Italy (35-day occupation of the [[Fiat]])
*upper Clyde shipbuilder workers staged a work-in during 1971-72 with about 260 further occupations in Britain in the following decade
*the [[1971 Harco work-in]], Australia
*[[Uruguay general strike, 1973|1973 Uruguayan general strike]]
*[[Lip factory]] in France in 1973
*the occupation of the ceramics factory formerly known as Zanon in Argentina starting in 2001, that under workers' control changed its name to [[FaSinPat]]
*the occupation of the [[Republic Windows and Doors]] factory in Chicago in 2008, and the re-occupation of the factory in 2012
*A 77-day occupation of the [[SsangYong Motor Company|Ssangyong]] car factory in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8187542.stm |title=S Korea factory occupation ends |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-08-06 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Current occupation of Viomichaniki Metalleutiki in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Greece]], along the lines of factory occupations in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/greek-workers-take-over-factory-video-interview/|title=Greek Workers Take Over a Factory [Video Interview]|first=Laura|last=Flanders|publisher=|via=www.thenation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biennio Rosso ==
Radical unionism started after the first world war. The movement was a result of increasing internal commissions or "faculty councils". Around November 1918, the councils/commissions had morphed into a national problem. By February 1919, the federation of Italian metal workers had successfully received a contract permitting these commissions in their factories. In May 1919, these commissions began to transfer into councils that were managing the factories and were dominating the power structure of said workplaces. The contract also prevented democratic elections of these council members or "stewards". In April 1920, at Fiat, there was the beginning of sit-in strikes by the workers, which eventually grew to 500,000 workers striking at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libcom.org/history/articles/italy-factory-occupations-1920|title=1918-1921: The Italian factory occupations and Biennio Rosso|website=libcom.org|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The French General Strike ==
In France in January 1936, the PCF, a Stalinist communist organization spurred the creation of a coalition of radicals called the "popular front". This organization was designed to defend democracy and disassemble fascist bonds. In May 1936, the popular front won a majority election and assembled a cabinet of eighteen socialist, thirteen radicals and four independent socialist to govern. Communists supported the leaderrLeon Blum but refused to join the cabinet. This change in power was spurred by a massive general strike in the years preceding where thousands of factories had been occupied by French workers to ensure said democratic governance. Blum effectively ended the strike when this government came to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.workersliberty.org/node/6469|title=1936: “The French revolution has begun”|last=B|first=Simon|website=Workers' Liberty|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== May 68 Revolution ==
During a period of civil unrest in France in the 1960s, student protests were joined by factory occupations and strikes by French workers. See [[May 1968 events in France]].

== Fiat Occupation in Italy ==
In the 1960s, a historic movement of strikes and factory occupations had a significant effect on Italy. After constant failure by the government to follow through on promises for reform in Italy, a surge of uprising and strikes occurred between 1968 and 1970. Earlier strikes at northern factories in Turin were successful in gaining momentum in 1962. The Lancia factory walkout was successful in gaining some workers rights. The Michelin Factory strike around the same time had less success. A large strike in Turin however, amassing 93,000 of the Fiat workforce for a massive walkout and intimidation of those who did not participate. After further political negotiation and action through the years that followed, and unsatisfactory changes in policy coupled with increasingly educated and aware workers, the series of massive strikes broke out in 1968. The autumn of 1969 is considered the climax of these strikes and they continued through the early 1970s resulting in significantly improved conditions for Italian workers. In 1973, over 6 million workers were on strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libcom.org/history/1962-1973-worker-student-struggles-italy|title=1962-1973: Worker and student struggles in Italy|website=libcom.org|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Upper Clyde Ship Builder Work-In ==
The Upper Clyde Ship Builders are a Scottish shipbuilder consortium that was birthed in 1968 by an adjoining of 5 shipbuilders. It was liquidated in 1971 resulting in occupation/work-in campaign by shop stewards in shipyards. See [[Upper Clyde Shipbuilders]].

== Harco Work-In ==
The Harco work-in of 1971 was an occupation by steel plant workers in New South Wales, Australia. The 4-week long work-in was the result of a dispute between Harco owners and workers on company sacking and rehiring practices during low production periods to save money. See [[1971 Harco work-in]].

== Uruguayan General Strike ==
During 1973, a close of parliament and essential dictatorship by the president created unrest and the leftist union called for a general strike and occupation of factories. After two weeks most of the union leaders were in jail, exile, or dead. See [[1973 Uruguayan general strike]].

== French LIP Factory ==
When the LIP factory in France decided to close a factory due to financial problems in the late 60s and early 70s, strikes and a very public factory occupation eventually transferred control and management of the factory to the workers. See [[LIP (company)]]

== Zanon Factory Occupation ==
During the Argentine uprising of the early 2000s, there was a complete takeover of the Zanon tile factory in Argentina. The workers went on strike in the year 2000, the first of a series of strikes that was spurred by the death of a worker from a heart attack. They also were adamant about making their conflicts with the company very public. Workers traveled and occupied places other than factories as well. In January 2001, there was a 6-day strike over unpaid wages. In April 2001, there was a 34-day strike over outstanding wages. These strikes were followed by many other occupations and strikes that ultimately cause the factories to lose almost 50% of their production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libcom.org/library/zanon-factory-occupation-interview-with-workers|title=Zanon factory occupation - interview with workers|website=libcom.org|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Republic Windows and Doors Occupation ==
When Republic Windows and Doors company was declared bankrupt in December 2008, an organized sit-own strike of 200 workers in the factory occurred to protest federal labor law violations by the company.

== Ssangyong Car Factory Occupation ==
A long occupation of the Ssangyong car factory by 900 factory workers and several thousand others began on May 22, 2009 after a list of firings was released by the company that showed over 1000 workers to be laid off. This was the result of the company filing for bankruptcy in February 2009. Workers were essentially sieged by the company during their occupation and workers refused all company negotiations that did not include jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2009/07/kore-j01.html|title=South Korea: Clashes erupt at Ssangyong factory occupation - World Socialist Web Site|last=Cook|first=Terry|website=www.wsws.org|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 2013, '''Parrish Dennison''' was shot and killed by [[Albuquerque Police Department|Albuquerque police]] officers Perdue, Dedler and Aragon. Dennison was suspected of being one of three people attempting to sell a stolen banjo from the robbery of a local music store. Police fired on Dennison after they alleged that he pointed out a revolver on them. Dennison's mother, Charlotte Ingraham asserts that footage from a helicopter camera shows otherwise. Police video from after the shooting shows Dennison on the ground with a gun in his hand. Since the incident Dennison’s family has filed a lawsuit for a wrongful death. The shooting was ruled as justified by the [[Bernalillo County, New Mexico|Bernalillo County]] District Attorney's Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cruz|first1=Megan|title=Family files wrongful death over 2013 police involved shooting|url=http://www.koat.com/news/family-files-wrongful-death-lawsuit-over-2013-policeinvolved-shooting/31623136|accessdate=5 May 2015|agency=KOAT Albuquerque|publisher=KOAT Albuquerque|date=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A witness to the incident says that Dennison did not point a gun at officers before the shooting, and that Dennison tried to break through a window but bounced off before police fired upon him. The witness said, "He never once pointed the gun at them, nothing… He just hit that window and just bounced back and then boom, boom, boom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Velasquez|first1=Anna|title=Witness: Man didn't point gun at cops before shooting|url=http://www.koat.com/news/new-mexico/albuquerque/Witness-Man-didn-t-point-gun-at-cops-before-shooting/19219550|accessdate=5 May 2015|agency=KOAT Albuquerque|publisher=KOAT Albuquerque|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NSA surveillance|1}}
The '''President's Surveillance Program''' ('''PSP''') is a collection of [[secret]] [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] activities authorized by the [[President of the United States]] [[George W. Bush]] after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 as part of the [[War on Terrorism]]. Information collected under this program was protected within a [[Sensitive Compartmented Information]] security compartment codenamed [[Stellar Wind (code name)|STELLARWIND]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jun/27/nsa-inspector-general-report-document-data-collection NSA Inspector General report on the President's Surveillance Program], March 24, 2009, page 10, note 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last presidential authorization expired on February 1, 2007, but some of the collection activities were continued, first under the authority of the Protect America Act of 2007, passed in August of that year, and then under the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008|FISA Amendments Act]] (FAA), which was enacted in July 2008.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

One part of the program was the [[Terrorist Surveillance Program]], which authorized warrantless [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]] of international communications where one party to the communication was believed to be affiliated with al-Qaeda. The other activities have reportedly included [[data mining]] of [[e-mail]] messages&lt;ref name=NT2&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/11/us/11nsa.html?_r=1 |title=U.S. Wiretapping of Limited Value, Officials Report |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2009-07-12 |accessdate=2009-07-12 |quote=The report states that at the same time Mr. Bush authorized the warrantless wiretapping operation, he also signed off on other surveillance programs that the government has never publicly acknowledged. While the report does not identify them, current and former officials say that those programs included data mining of e-mail messages of Americans. |first1=Eric |last1=Lichtblau |first2=James |last2=Risen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and telephone [[call detail record]]s in the [[NSA call database]].&lt;ref name="USA"&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls|work=[[USA Today]]|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-10-nsa_x.htm|accessdate=2009-07-12|date=2006-05-11|first=Leslie |last=Cauley|quote=The National Security Agency has been secretly collecting the phone call records of tens of millions of Americans, using data provided by AT&amp;T, Verizon and BellSouth, people with direct knowledge of the arrangement told ''USA Today''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] publicly acknowledged the existence of other intelligence activities covered under the same Presidential authorizations.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt; The full extent of the President's Surveillance Program was revealed in June 2013, when ''The Guardian'' published a highly classified report of the Inspector General of the NSA, describing how the program was established and evolved from September 2001 until January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jun/27/nsa-inspector-general-report-document-data-collection NSA Inspector General report on the President's Surveillance Program], March 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The President's Surveillance Program activities were periodically reauthorized by the President, and were later transitioned to authority granted in the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008]]. The act required the [[Inspector General|Inspectors General]] of all [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence agencies]] involved in the program to "complete a comprehensive review" of the activities through January 17, 2007, and produce an unclassified report within one year after enactment. The report published on July 10, 2009 concluded that the President's program involved "unprecedented collection activities" that went far beyond the scope of the Terrorist Surveillance Program.&lt;ref name=IG&gt;{{cite report |url=https://fas.org/irp/eprint/psp.pdf|title=Unclassified Report on the President’s Surveillance Program|format=pdf |author=Inspectors General of the DoD, DOJ, CIA, NSA, and ODNI |date=2009-07-10 |accessdate=2018-03-03|quote=Finally, the collection activities pursued under the PSP, and under FISA following the PSP's transition to that authority, involved unprecedented collection activities. We believe the retention and use by IC organizations of information collected under the PSP and FISA should be carefully monitored.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report raised questions over the legal underpinnings of the authorizations, a lack of oversight, excessive secrecy, and the effectiveness of the program.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hEr2O_sANlmWwPWdPygTxCbq1_bQD99C4KI00 |title=Report: Too few officials knew of surveillance |publisher=[[Google News]]|agency=[[The Associated Press]] |first=Pamela |last=Hess |accessdate=2009-07-11 |date=2009-07-11|quote=Not enough relevant officials were aware of the size and depth of an unprecedented surveillance program started under President George W.

Public disclosure of the Terrorist Surveillance Program in 2005 ignited the [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy]]. The other classified aspects of the program had also raised serious concerns within the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] over the program's legal status and its potential effect on future criminal prosecutions. This caused conflicts with the White House that resulted in a dramatic confrontation in 2004 at the hospital bedside of the ailing Attorney General, and nearly led to mass resignations of top Justice officials in protest when they were overruled.&lt;ref name=PI&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/front_page/20090711_Report__Wiretaps_risked_a_crisis.html |title=Report: Wiretaps risked a crisis |first1=Carrie |last1=Johnson |first2=Ellen |last2=Nakashima |work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |agency=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=2009-07-12 |date=2009-07-12 |quote=The Bush White House so strictly controlled access to its warrantless-eavesdropping program that only three Justice Department lawyers were aware of the plan, which nearly ignited mass resignations and a constitutional crisis when a wider circle of administration officials began to question its legality, according to a watchdog report released yesterday. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713055716/http://www.philly.com/inquirer/front_page/20090711_Report__Wiretaps_risked_a_crisis.html |archivedate=July 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report on the program was also released during a period of intense negotiations over proposed language in the [[Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010]] that would amend the [[National Security Act of 1947]], increasing the requirements for briefing Congress on some classified intelligence programs like this one—President [[Barack Obama]] has threatened to [[veto]] the bill over that issue.&lt;ref name=NT&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/us/politics/12intel.html?hp |title=Cheney Is Linked to Concealment of C.I.A.

==Background==
In the weeks following the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]], the [[President of the United States]] authorized the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) to conduct a classified program to detect and prevent further attacks in the United States. As part of the NSA's classified program, several different intelligence activities were authorized in Presidential authorizations, and the details of these activities changed over time. The program was reauthorized by the President approximately every 45 days, with certain modifications. Collectively, the activities carried out under these authorizations are referred to as the "President's Surveillance Program" (PSP).&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

One of the activities authorized as part of the PSP was the interception of the content of communications into and out of the United States where there was "a reasonable basis to conclude that one party to the communication is a member of al-Qa'ida, affiliated with al-Qa'ida, or a member of an organization affiliated with al-Qa'ida". After a series of articles published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' revealed classified details on this aspect of the PSP, they were publicly acknowledged and described by the President, the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], and other [[Presidency of George W. Bush#Administration and cabinet|Administration]] officials beginning in December 2005, including a [[United States presidential address|Presidential radio address]] on December 17, 2005. The President and other Administration officials labeled the publicly disclosed interception of the content of certain international communications by the NSA as the "[[Terrorist Surveillance Program]]" (TSP). The Attorney General subsequently publicly acknowledged that other intelligence activities were also authorized under the same Presidential authorization, but the details of those activities remain classified.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

Several different agencies had roles in the PSP. At the request of the [[White House]], the NSA was involved in providing the technical expertise necessary to create the program. The NSA also was responsible for conducting the actual collection of information under the PSP and disseminating intelligence reports to other agencies such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), and the Office of the [[Director of National Intelligence]] (ODNI) [[National Counterterrorism Center]] (NCTC) for analysis and possible investigation. With the exception of the NSA, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) had limited involvement in the PSP.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

Components of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) other than the FBI also were involved in the program. Most significantly,{{According to whom|date=January 2015}} DOJ's [[Office of Legal Counsel]] (OLC) provided advice to the White House and the Attorney General on the overall legality of the PSP. In addition, DOJ's [[Office of Intelligence Policy and Review]] (now called the Office of Intelligence in [[United States Department of Justice National Security Division|DOJ's National Security Division]]) worked with the FBI and the NSA to address the impact that PSP-derived information had on proceedings under the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA). DOJ's National Security Division also handled potential [[discovery (law)|discovery]] issues that may have involved PSP-related information in international terrorism prosecutions.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

The CIA, in addition to receiving intelligence reports as PSP consumers, requested information from the program and used this information in its [[intelligence analysis|intelligence analyses]]. The CIA also initially prepared [[threat assessment]] memoranda that were used to support the periodic Presidential authorizations. Beginning in 2005, the newly created ODNI assumed responsibility for preparing these threat assessment memoranda. In addition, NCTC analysts received program information for possible use in analytical products prepared for the President, senior policymakers, and other [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]] (IC) analysts and officers.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

==PSP IG Group report==
The Inspectors General (IGs) of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD), [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ), [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), and [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] (ODNI)&amp;nbsp;– collectively the "PSP IG Group"&amp;nbsp;– conducted the review required under the FISA Amendments Act. The 32 page unclassified report, dated July 10, 2009, summarized the portions of the collective results of the IG reviews that could be released in unclassified form. A separate classified report summarized the classified results of the individual IG reviews.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt; The classified report is reportedly several hundred pages long. The unclassified report revealed new details of internal deliberations over the programs, but few new details on the scope of the surveillance.&lt;ref name=MH /&gt;

The PSP IG Group collectively interviewed approximately 200 government and private sector personnel as part of this review. Among the interviewees were former and current senior government officials, including [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI) [[John Negroponte]], NSA and CIA Director and Principal Deputy DNI (PDDNI) [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]], White House Counsel and Attorney General [[Alberto Gonzales]], [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Director]] [[Robert Mueller]], and [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]]. The IGs did not have the power to compel testimony,&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/10/AR2009071002536.html?wprss=rss_print/asection |title=Inspectors General Report Faults Secrecy of Surveillance Program |first1=Carrie |last1=Johnson |first2=Ellen |last2=Nakashima|work= [[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2009-07-11|date=2009-07-11|quote=&amp;nbsp;'Extraordinary and inappropriate' secrecy about a warrantless eavesdropping program undermined its effectiveness as a terrorism-fighting tool, government watchdogs have concluded in the first examination of one of the most contentious episodes of the Bush administration.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Office of the Vice President of the United States|Counsel to the Vice President]] [[David Addington]], [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Andrew Card]], Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]], DOJ [[Office of Legal Counsel]] Deputy Assistant Attorney General [[John Yoo]], and former [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[George Tenet]] declined the opportunity to be interviewed for the review.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

===Origin of the program===
In the days immediately after September 11, 2001, the NSA used its existing authorities to gather intelligence information in response to the terrorist attacks. When Director of Central Intelligence Tenet, on behalf of the White House, asked NSA Director Hayden whether the NSA could do more against terrorism, Hayden replied that nothing more could be done within existing authorities. When asked what he might do with more authority, Hayden said he put together information on what was operationally useful and technologically feasible. This information formed the basis of the PSP. Shortly thereafter, the President authorized the NSA to undertake a number of new, highly classified intelligence activities.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

The specific intelligence activities that were permitted by the Presidential Authorizations were highly classified. Former White House Counsel and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told the [[United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General|DOJ OIG]] that it was the President's decision to keep the program a "close hold." Gonzales stated that the President made the decision on all requests to "[[read into|read in]]" any non-operational persons, including DOJ officials. Attorney General Ashcroft approved the first Presidential Authorization for the PSP as to "form and legality" on the same day that he was read into the program in October 2001.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

The CIA initially prepared the [[threat assessment]] memoranda that were used to support the Presidential Authorization and periodic reauthorizations of the PSP. The memoranda documented intelligence assessments of the terrorist threats to the United States and to U.S. interests abroad from al-Qa'ida and affiliated terrorist organizations. Initially, the analysts who prepared the [[threat assessment]]s were not read into the PSP and did not know how the threat assessments would be used.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

"DOJ Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo was responsible for drafting the first series of legal memoranda supporting the program. Yoo was the only OLC official 'read into' the PSP from the program's inception in October 2001."&lt;ref name=IG /&gt; [[Jay Bybee]] was OLC Assistant Attorney General at the time, and Yoo's supervisor. However, Bybee stated he was never read into the PSP and could shed no further light on how Yoo came to draft the OLC opinions on the program. The first OLC opinion directly supporting the legality of the PSP was dated November 2, 2001, and was drafted by Yoo.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

NSA Director Hayden consulted with NSA senior technical experts and experienced attorneys from the NSA's Office of General Counsel, but only Hayden knew about and participated in the development of the Presidential Authorization by serving as a technical advisor. After the Authorization was signed, NSA attorneys supported the lawfulness of the resulting program. After Hayden received the first Authorization, he assembled 80 to 90 people in a conference room and explained what the President had authorized. Hayden said: "We're going to do exactly what he said and not one photon or electron more." According to Hayden, the program was designed to provide the NSA with the operational agility to cover terrorism-related targets.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

===Legal underpinnings===

====Initial justification====
John Yoo was the sole OLC attorney who advised Attorney General Ashcroft and White House officials on the PSP from the program's inception in October 2001 through Yoo's resignation from DOJ in May 2003. Upon Yoo's departure, another DOJ official, [[Patrick F. Philbin|Patrick Philbin]], was selected by the White House to be read into the PSP to assume Yoo's role as advisor to the Attorney General concerning the program. In addition, [[Jack Goldsmith]] replaced Jay Bybee as the Assistant Attorney General for OLC on October 6, 2003. Even though Bybee had never been read into the PSI, Philbin persuaded Counsel to the Vice President David Addington to read in Goldsmith, Bybee's replacement. After being read into the PSP, Goldsmith and Philbin became concerned about the factual and legal basis for Yoo's legal memoranda supporting the program.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

Goldsmith and Philbin began developing an analysis to more fully address the FISA statute with respect to the PSP. Beginning in August 2003, Philbin and later Goldsmith brought their concerns about the OLC legal opinions to Attorney General Ashcroft. In December 2003, Goldsmith and Philbin met with Counsel to the Vice President Addington and White House Counsel Gonzales at the White House to express their growing concerns about the legal underpinnings of the program. In late January 2004, at Goldsmith's request, the White House agreed to allow Deputy Attorney General [[James Comey]] to be read into the PSP following Comey's confirmation as the Deputy Attorney General in December 2003. After being briefed, Comey agreed that the concerns about Yoo's legal analysis were well-founded. Comey told the DOJ OIG that of particular concern to him and Goldsmith was the notion that Yoo's legal analysis entailed ignoring an act of Congress, and doing so without full congressional notification.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

The DOJ OIG later concluded that it was extraordinary and inappropriate that a single DOJ attorney, John Yoo, was relied upon to conduct the initial legal assessment of the PSP, and that the lack of oversight and review of Yoo's work, as customarily is the practice of OLC, contributed to a legal analysis of the PSP that at a minimum was factually flawed. Deficiencies in the legal memoranda became apparent once additional DOJ attorneys were read into the program in 2003 and when those attorneys sought a greater understanding of the PSP's operation. The DOJ OIG concluded that the White House's strict controls over DOJ access to the PSP undermined DOJ's ability to perform its critical legal function during the PSP's early phase of operation.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

====Conflicts between DOJ and the White house====
Comey told the DOJ OIG that he met with Attorney General Ashcroft on March 4, 2004, to discuss the PSP and that Ashcroft agreed with Comey and the other DOJ officials' assessment of the potential legal problems with the PSP. Later that day, Ashcroft was struck with severe [[gallstone]] [[pancreatitis]] and was admitted to the [[George Washington University Hospital]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Because of Ashcroft's disability, Comey took over as Acting Attorney General.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

Later on March 5, Gonzales called Goldsmith to request a letter from OLC stating that Yoo's prior OLC opinions "covered the program," meaning the PSP. Goldsmith, Philbin, and Comey re-examined Yoo's memoranda and concluded that Yoo's memoranda did not accurately describe some of the Other Intelligence Activities that were being conducted under the Presidential Authorizations implementing the PSP, and that the memoranda therefore did not provide a basis for finding that these activities were legal. On Saturday, March 6, Goldsmith and Philbin, with Comey's concurrence, met with Addington and Gonzales at the White House to convey their conclusions that certain activities in the PSP should cease.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

After a series of follow-up meetings between DOJ and White House officials, the President instructed Vice President Cheney on the morning of Wednesday, March 10, to call a meeting with congressional leaders to advise them of the impasse with DOJ. A meeting with the Top administration officials, and the congressional leaders known as the [[Gang of Eight (intelligence)|Gang of Eight]], but without DOJ personnel, was convened in the [[White House Situation Room]] later that day. According to Gonzales's notes of the meeting, the consensus of the congressional leaders was that the program should continue. However, after Gonzales testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 24, 2007, Representative [[Nancy Pelosi]], Senator [[Jay Rockefeller]], and Senator [[Tom Daschle]] issued statements sharply disputing Gonzales's characterization of their statements at the March 10, 2004 meeting, stating that there was no consensus at the meeting that the program should proceed.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

=====Ashcroft hospital bedside meeting=====
Gonzales told the DOJ OIG that following the meeting with the congressional leaders on March 10, President Bush instructed him and Card to go to the George Washington University Hospital to speak to Ashcroft, who was in the intensive care unit recovering from surgery. At approximately 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. that day, Comey learned that Gonzales and Card were on their way to the hospital to see Ashcroft. He relayed this information to FBI Director Mueller, and told him that Ashcroft was in no condition to receive guests, much less make a decision about whether to recertify the PSP. Philbin said he was leaving work that evening when he received a call from Comey, who told Philbin that he needed to get to the hospital right away and to call Goldsmith and tell him what was happening.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

Comey recalled that he ran up the stairs with his security detail to Ashcroft's floor, and he entered Ashcroft's room, which he described as darkened, and found Ashcroft lying in bed and his wife standing by his side. Comey said he began speaking to Ashcroft, and that it was not clear that Ashcroft could focus and that he "seemed pretty bad off." Goldsmith and Philbin arrived at the hospital within a few minutes of each other, and met with Comey in an adjacent room. Comey, Goldsmith, and Philbin later entered Ashcroft's room and, according to Goldsmith's notes, Comey and the others advised Ashcroft "not to sign anything."&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

When Gonzales and Card arrived, they entered Ashcroft's hospital room and stood across from Mrs. Ashcroft at the head of the bed, with Comey, Goldsmith, and Philbin behind them. Gonzales told the DOJ OIG that he carried with him in a manila envelope the March 11, 2004, Presidential authorization for Ashcroft to sign. According to Philbin, Gonzales first asked Ashcroft how he was feeling and Ashcroft replied, "Not well." Gonzales then said words to the effect, "You know, there's a reauthorization that has to be renewed ..."&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

Comey testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that at this point Ashcroft told Gonzales and Card "in very strong terms" about his legal concerns with the PSP, which Comey testified Ashcroft drew from his meeting with Comey about the program a week earlier. Comey testified that Ashcroft next stated: " 'But that doesn't matter, because I'm not the Attorney General. There is the Attorney General,' and he pointed to me&amp;nbsp;– I was just to his left. The two men [Gonzales and Card] did not acknowledge me; they turned and walked from the room."&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

Gonzales subsequently summoned Comey to the White House, and he brought [[United States Solicitor General]] [[Theodore Olson]] with him as a witness. Andy Card was also present for this meeting which took place later that evening. Gonzales told the DOJ OIG that little more was achieved at this meeting other than a general acknowledgment that a "situation" continued to exist because of the disagreement between DOJ and the White House regarding legal authorization for the program.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

====White House Counsel reauthorization====
On the morning of March 11, 2004, with the Presidential Authorization set to expire, President Bush signed a new Authorization for the PSP. In a departure from the past practice of having the Attorney General certify the Authorization as to form and legality, the March 11 Authorization was certified by White House Counsel Gonzales. At noon on March 11, Director Mueller met with Card at the White House. According to Mueller's notes, Card told Mueller that if no "legislative fix" could be found by May 6, 2004, when the March 11 Authorization was set to expire, the program would be discontinued. Mueller wrote that he told Card that the failure to have DOJ representation at the congressional briefing and the attempt to have Ashcroft certify the Authorization without going through Comey "gave the strong perception that the [White House] was trying to do an end run around the Acting [Attorney General] whom they knew to have serious concerns as to the legality of portions of the program."&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

Several senior DOJ and FBI officials considered resigning after the Presidential Authorization was signed without DOJ's concurrence. Comey told the DOJ OIG that he drafted a letter of resignation because he believed it was impossible for him to remain with DOJ if the President would do something DOJ said was not legally supportable. Comey also testified that Ashcroft's Chief of Staff David Ayres believed Ashcroft also was likely to resign and thus Ayres urged Comey to wait until Ashcroft was well enough to resign with him. Goldsmith told the DOJ OIG he drafted a resignation letter at around the same time as Comey. According to his contemporaneous notes, Goldsmith cited the "shoddiness" of the prior OLC legal review, the "over-secrecy" of the PSP, and the "shameful" incident at the hospital as among his grievances.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

At approximately 1:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on March 12, 2004, FBI Director Mueller drafted by hand a letter to withdraw the FBI from participation in the program. Mueller told the DOJ OIG that he planned on having the letter typed and then tendering it, but that based on subsequent events his resignation was not necessary. Later that morning, the President met with Mueller. According to Mueller's notes,
Mueller told the President of his concerns regarding the FBI's continued participation in the program, and that he was considering resigning if the FBI were directed to continue to participate without the concurrence of the Attorney General. Mueller wrote that he explained to the President that he had an "independent obligation to the FBI and to DOJ to assure the legality of actions we undertook, and that a presidential order alone could not do that." According to Mueller's notes, the President then directed Mueller to meet with Comey and other PSP principals to address the legal concerns so that the FBI could continue participating in the program "as appropriate under the law."&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

On March 17, 2004 the President decided to modify certain PSP intelligence-gathering activities and to discontinue certain Other Intelligence Activities that DOJ believed were legally unsupported. The President's directive was expressed in two modifications to the March 11, 2004 Presidential Authorization. On May 6, 2004 Goldsmith and Philbin completed an OLC legal memorandum assessing the legality of the PSP as it was operating at that time. The OLC memorandum stated that the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed by Congress shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001 gave the President authority to use both domestically and abroad "all necessary and appropriate force," including [[signals intelligence]] capabilities, to prevent future acts of international terrorism against the United States.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

====Transfer to FISA====
Certain activities that were originally authorized as part of the PSP have subsequently been authorized under orders issued by the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] (FISC). The activities transitioned in this manner included the interception of certain international communications that the President publicly described as the "Terrorist Surveillance Program." Further details regarding this transition are classified. As a result of this transition, the President decided not to reauthorize these activities and the final Presidential Authorization expired on February 1, 2007. The [[Protect America Act of 2007]], passed in August of that year, amended FISA to address the government's ability to conduct electronic surveillance in the United States of persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States. This legislation expired in early 2008, and in July 2008 the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008]] was enacted.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

The DOJ OIG review concluded that several considerations favored initiating the process of transitioning the PSP to FISA authority earlier than had been done, especially as the program became less a temporary response to the September 11 terrorist attacks and more a permanent surveillance tool. These considerations included the PSP's effect on [[Privacy laws of the United States|privacy interests of U.S. persons]], the instability of the legal reasoning on which the program rested for several years, and the substantial restrictions placed on FBI agents' access to and use of program-derived information due to the highly classified status of the PSP.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

====Briefings====
Each Presidential Authorization also included a requirement to maintain the secrecy of the activities carried out under the program. The President also noted his intention to inform appropriate members of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the program "as soon as I judge that it can be done consistently with national defense needs." According to the NSA, between October 25, 2001, and January 17, 2007, Hayden and succeeding NSA Director [[Keith B. Alexander]], sometimes supported by other NSA personnel, conducted approximately 49 briefings to members of Congress and their staff, 17 of which took place before the December 2005 media reports regarding what was called the "Terrorist Surveillance Program." Hayden told the IGs that during the many PSP briefings to members of Congress no one ever suggested that NSA should stop the program.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

From January 2002 to January 2006, only [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] (FISC) Presiding Judge [[Royce C. Lamberth]], followed by Presiding Judge [[Colleen Kollar-Kotelly]], were [[read into]] the PSP. The circumstances under which the Presiding Judge was notified of the existence of the PSP and read into the program, and the measures subsequently taken to address the effect of the PSP on the government's relationship with the FISC are only revealed in the classified report.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

====Discovery issues====
DOJ was aware as early as 2002 that information collected under the PSP could have implications for DOJ's litigation responsibilities under [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]] Rule 16 and ''[[Brady v. Maryland]]'' 373 U.S. 83 (1963). Analysis of this discovery issue was first assigned to OLC Deputy Assistant Attorney General [[John Yoo]] in 2003. However, no DOJ attorneys with terrorism prosecution responsibilities were read into the PSP until mid-2004, and as a result DOJ continued to lack the advice of attorneys who were best equipped to identify and examine the discovery issues in connection with the PSP. The steps taken since then to address discovery issues with respect to the PSP are discussed only in the classified report. The DOJ may need to re-examine past cases to see whether potentially discoverable but undisclosed Rule 16 or Brady material was collected under the PSP, to ensure that it has complied with its discovery obligations in such cases.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

====Effectiveness====
The IGs also examined the impact of PSP information on counterterrorism efforts. Many senior IC officials believe that the PSP filled a gap in intelligence collection thought to exist under the FISA statute shortly after the al-Qa'ida terrorist attacks against the United States. Others within the IC, including FBI agents, CIA analysts and officers, and other officials had difficulty evaluating the precise contribution of the PSP to counterterrorism efforts because it was most often viewed as one source among many available analytic and intelligence-gathering tools in these efforts. The IG reports describe several examples of how PSP-derived information factored into specific investigations and operations.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

During the May 2006 Senate hearing on his nomination to be CIA Director, Hayden said that, had the PSP been in place before the September 2001 attacks, hijackers [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]] and [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]] almost certainly would have been identified and located. In May 2009, Hayden told NSA OIG that the value of the Program was in knowing that NSA signals intelligence activities under the PSP covered an important "quadrant" of terrorist communications. NSA's Deputy Director echoed Hayden's comment when he said that the value of the PSP was in the confidence it provided that someone was looking at the seam between the foreign and domestic intelligence domains.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

The DOJ OIG found that the exceptionally [[Compartmentalization (intelligence)|compartmented]] nature of the program created some frustration for FBI personnel. Some agents and analysts criticized the PSP-derived information they received for providing insufficient details, and the agents who managed counterterrorism programs at the FBI field offices the DOJ OIG visited said the FBI's process for disseminating PSP-derived information failed to adequately prioritize the information for investigation. In sum, the DOJ OIG found it difficult to assess or quantify the overall effectiveness of the PSP program as it relates to the FBI's counterterrorism activities. However, based on the interviews conducted and documents reviewed, the DOJ OIG concluded that although PSP-derived information had value in some counterterrorism investigations, it generally played a limited role in the FBI's overall counterterrorism efforts.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

The CIA OIG determined that several factors hindered the CIA in making full use of the product of the PSP. Many CIA officials stated that too few CIA personnel at the working level were read into the PSP. The CIA OIG determined that the CIA did not implement procedures to assess the usefulness of the product of the PSP and did not routinely document whether particular PSP reporting had contributed to successful counterterrorism operations. In a May 2006 briefing to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, a senior CIA official said that PSP reporting was rarely the sole basis for an intelligence success, but that it frequently played a supporting role.&lt;ref name=IG /&gt;

===Reaction===
[[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] (D-Calif.), issued a statement on the day the report was released saying, "no president should be able to operate outside the law." She was responding specifically to a statement in the report attributed to former Deputy Attorney General [[James B. Comey]] that,&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; "Yoo's legal analysis entailed ignoring an act of Congress, and doing so without full congressional notification."&lt;ref name=IG /&gt; Pelosi further stated that, "the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees will closely examine the findings and recommendations of the classified and unclassified reports, and will conduct appropriate oversight of electronic surveillance activities."&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/07/12/bush.wiretap/ |title=Bush-era wiretap program had limited results, report finds |publisher= CNN.com |accessdate=2009-07-12 |quote=Former Deputy Attorney General James Comey, who took part in that face-off, told investigators that the program's original authorization 'involved ignoring an act of Congress, and doing so without full congressional notification.'

[[John Conyers Jr.]] (D-Mich.), [[House Judiciary Committee]] Chairman, made the following comments in an official statement on the day the report was released: "This report, mandated by Congress last year, documents what many of us in Congress concluded long ago: President Bush’s warrantless surveillance program was illegal from the beginning, and of questionable value. It clearly violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which regulates domestic surveillance for intelligence purposes, and was based on legal analysis that was 'factually flawed'.... The refusal of key Bush administration officials such as David Addington and John Yoo to cooperate with the IGs’ review underscores the need for an independent commission with subpoena power to further review these issues, as I have called for."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://judiciary.house.gov/news/090710.html |title=Conyers: IG Report Shows Bush Broke the Law, Personally Authorizing the Warrantless Surveillance Program |publisher=House Committee on the Judiciary|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BB&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=ai0sdApeGhds |title=Bush Wiretapping Program Lacked Proper Legal Review (Update1) |first=Christopher |last=Stern|publisher=Bloomberg.com |accessdate=2009-07-12 |date=2009-07-10 |quote='President Bush’s warrantless surveillance program was illegal from the beginning and of questionable value,' said House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat, in an e-mailed statement.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conyers' counterpart on the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-Vt.), issued a statement on the report saying its conclusions should highlight rule-of-law issues ignored by the previous administration. Leahy said, "This report underscores why we should move forward with a nonpartisan commission of inquiry. Without a thorough, independent review of decisions that run counter to our laws and treaties, we cannot ensure that these same mistakes are not repeated. Such a commission must have bipartisan support to be able to truly get to the bottom of these issues with objectivity and credibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gbmJ61GItjVdbI6rLlbNlq-8wneA |title=AFP: US govt review questions effectiveness of wiretaps |publisher=[[Google News]] |agency=Agence France-Presse |accessdate=2009-07-12 |date=2009-07-11|quote=Democrat Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that the conclusions of this review should help shed more light on these rule-of-law issues that the previous administration avoided for a long time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the report was released, former NSA Director [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]], who designed and implemented the program in 2001, told the [[Associated Press]] that he personally briefed key members of congress on the program. He maintained that the members were kept well-informed, and was distressed by suggestions that they were not. Hayden said key members of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] and [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] of both parties were briefed about four times a year, but admitted that the number of lawmakers informed was intentionally limited as the program was highly classified.&lt;ref name=AP2&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iwJhPuY4ndVAdfJgwbiS3uh7uIGgD99CJOBO0 |title=AP Interview: Hayden denies Congress not informed |publisher=[[Google News]] |first=Pamela|last=Hess|date=2009-07-12 |agency=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=2009-07-12 |quote=Former CIA Director Gen.

After her parents' divorce, Regina was sent to live with her grandparents from her mother's side in [[Normal, Illinois]]. After spending a few years in Normal, she journeyed back to Chicago and graduated from [[Hyde Park High School (Chicago, Illinois)|Hyde Park High School]] in 1919. She studied at the historically black college [[Wilberforce University]] and worked in its [[Carnegie library|Carnegie Library]]. After studying there for a year, Anderson returned home to Chicago and was hired as a junior library assistant at the [[Chicago Public Library]] in 1921. A short time after, she moved to New York where she first settled in downtown Manhattan living at a [[YWCA USA|YWCA]]. While staying at the YWCA she applied to be a librarian at the [[Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture|135th Street branch]] of the [[New York Public Library]], working under the supervision of [[Ernestine Rose (librarian)|Ernestine Rose]].&lt;ref name="AO2018" /&gt; She shared an apartment in the [[Sugar Hill, Manhattan|Sugar Hill]] district of [[Harlem]] with [[Ethel Ray Nance|Ethel Ray]] and Louella Tucker. The women opened the space to the community, hosting [[Salon (gathering)|salons]], events, and gatherings for artists.&lt;ref name="AO2018" /&gt; Located at 580 [[Saint Nicholas Avenue]], the apartment became known as the "580" and the "Harlem West Side Literary Salon".&lt;ref name="EHR"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mirro|first=Julya|chapter=Anderson, Regina M.|title=Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance|year=2004|volume=2|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-203-31930-7|pages=25–26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-VNopZkYpQC&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=Regina%20M.%20Anderson&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson helped to organize the Civic Club dinner of 1924 for black [[New York City|New York]] intellectuals and writers. Attended by 110 guests, including [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Jean Toomer]], [[Countee Cullen]], [[Charles S.

Andrews and Du Bois co-founded the [[Harlem Renaissance Theatre Companies|Krigwa Players (later Negro Experimental Theatre)]], a black theater company.  The Players produced her plays ''Climbing Jacob's Ladder'' (about a [[lynching]]) and ''Underground'' (about the [[Underground Railroad]]).

Regina Andrews was one of ten African-American women whose contributions were recognized at the [[1939 World's Fair]] in New York.

She was the first minority to climb the ranks and become a supervising librarian at the New York Public Library, at the 115th Street ranch in 1938, and her struggle to break the color barrier has earned her numerous accolades.&lt;ref name="Whitmire"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AO2018"/&gt;

Andrews outlived virtually all of the other members of the Harlem Renaissance. She died in [[Ossining (village), New York|Ossining]], a suburb of New York City.

Regina married the Howard University and Columbia Law School grad [[William T.

== Career as a Librarian ==
Anderson moved to New York in 1921, at the age of 21 to apply for a librarian position at the New York Public Library. Previously, she had worked in various libraries in and around Chicago. She started her position as a full-time clerk in 1923 under the leadership of [[Ernestine Rose]], who wanted to make sure the community was served by librarians that reflected their diversity. During this time, the library hosted meetings by groups like the [[NAACP]] and the Anti-Lynching Crusaders. Anderson also organized lectures by individuals like [[Hubert Harrison]] and [[Margaret Sanger]]. Anderson retired from the NYPL in 1966 but continued to remain active in her community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andrews, Regina (1901-1993), librarian and dramatist {{!}} American National Biography|url=http://www.anb.org/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-2001927;jsessionid=6BD7DAC25444FF9D6B779EB1097F1A7D#anb-9780198606697-e-2001927-section-3|language=en|doi=10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-2001927;jsessionid=6bd7dac25444ff9d6b779eb1097f1a7d#anb-9780198606697-e-2001927-section-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rewire: Digital Cosmopolitans in the Age of Connection''''' is a 2013 nonfiction [[book]] about contemporary [[globalization]] and [[xenophilia]] by American blogger [[Ethan Zuckerman]] of [[MIT]]. It describes [[homophily|homophilic]] barriers to [[cosmopolitanism]] such as [[filter bubble]]s and [[media bias]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6815">'''Rita Luisa Zucca''' ({{IPA-it|ˈriːta luˈiːza dˈdzukka; tˈtsukka}}, 1912–1998) was an Italian-American [[radio announcer]] who broadcast [[Axis powers|Axis]] propaganda to Allied troops in Italy and North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Herman Charles Morris (1946) World war II in pictures. New York, The Journal of Living Pub. Corp. p. 737&lt;/ref&gt; She became known as one of the "Axis Sallys", along with [[Mildred Gillars]], who broadcast out of Berlin, Germany.

==Early life==
Zucca's father, Louis, owned a very successful restaurant in [[New York City|New York's]] [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown district]] in the 1930s and 1940s, called Zucca's Italian Garden. Located at 116-118-120 West 49th Street, the restaurant had its own promotional postcards which displayed a distinctly refined setting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2009/05/04/zuccas-italian-garden-call-bryant-5511/ Zucca’s Italian Garden: call Bryant 5511] Ephemeral New York, May 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Zucca spent her teenage years in a convent school in Florence and, as a young woman, had worked in the family business.&lt;ref name="historynet.com"&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/axis-sally.htm/1 Axis Sally: The Americans Behind That Alluring Voice], HistoryNet, November 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

She returned to Italy in 1938, working as a typist and renouncing her American citizenship three years later to save her family's property from expropriation by Mussolini's government.&lt;ref name="historynet.com"/&gt;

==Axis Sally==
As the Allied invasion of Italy progressed, the Fascist government of [[Benito Mussolini]] decided to try to emulate the German radio’s Axis Sally broadcasts of [[Mildred Gillars]]. In the summer of 1943, the Italian national radio network in Rome hired the 30-year-old Zucca with this aim in mind, in spite of her losing a typing job in 1942 for copying an anti-Fascist pamphlet.&lt;ref name="historynet.com"/&gt;

Zucca was teamed with German broadcaster Charles Goedel in the program 'Jerry's Front Calling'. Much to Gillars' chagrin, Zucca was also referred to as Axis Sally. Zucca's trademark sign-off was "a sweet kiss from Sally", and she was often mistaken for Gillars.&lt;ref name="historynet.com"/&gt;

According to one account, Zucca signed onto each show by uttering "Hello Suckers!" and her signature tune was "[[Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea (song)|Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea]]".&lt;ref&gt;Byrd Stuart Leavell (1970) The 8th Evac: a history of the University of Virginia hospital unit in World War II. p. 213. Richmond: Dietz Press. OCLC:116968&lt;/ref&gt;

Her broadcasts sometimes used intelligence provided by the German embassy in Rome in an attempt to confuse Allied troops. On July 8, 1943, the night before the invasion of Sicily, Zucca's broadcast told "the wonderful boys of the 504th Parachute Regiment" that "Col. Willis Mitchell's playboys the [[61st Air Base Group|61st Troop Carrier Group]] are going to carry you to certain death. We know where and when you are jumping and you will be wiped out."&lt;ref name="historynet.com"/&gt;

As the Allied armies advanced north into Rome, Zucca retreated north with the Germans in 1944 and resumed broadcasting from Milan.&lt;ref name="historynet.com"/&gt; There, in September 1944, the broadcast crew of Jerry's Front was attached to a German military propaganda unit called the Liberty Station.&lt;ref name="historynet.com"/&gt; By then Zucca was pregnant. Her son was born on December 15, 1944.&lt;ref name="historynet.com"/&gt; She returned to the microphone 40 days later and continued until her final broadcast on April 25, 1945.&lt;ref name="historynet.com"/&gt;

==Arrest==
As the Axis army finally collapsed, Zucca went by train to her uncle’s home in Turin, where she took refuge until her identification and arrest on June 5, 1945.&lt;ref name="historynet.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1945/06/08/archives/americans-seize-axis-sally-in-italy-fascist-broadcaster-born-here.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A correspondent from the American military magazine ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' said that Zucca's well-known crossed-eye condition did nothing to detract from her attractiveness: "True, her left eye is inclined to wander — but that cooey, sexy voice really has something to back it up."&lt;ref name="historynet.com"/&gt;

Newspapers in America were far more scathing. "Soft-Voiced 'Sally from Berlin' Found to Be Ugly Ex–N.Y. Girl" was a typical headline, with descriptions of the young mother as "[as] ugly and unattractive in person as her voice was appealing."&lt;ref name="historynet.com"/&gt; Another journalist called her "cross-eyed, bow-legged and sallow-skinned."&lt;ref name="historynet.com"/&gt;

==Trial==
All attempts by the American government to prosecute Zucca for treason broke down when it became clear that she had renounced her American citizenship before she started broadcasting. The [[FBI]]'s [[J. Edgar Hoover]] wrote to the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]]: "In view of the fact that she has lost her American citizenship, no efforts are being made at the present time to develop a treason case against her."&lt;ref name="historynet.com"/&gt;

Zucca was then tried by an Italian [[military tribunal]] on charges of collaboration. On March 29, 1946 she was sentenced to 4½ years in prison, but was released after 9 months.&lt;ref&gt;William G. Shofield (1964) Treason Trail. p. 24-25. Chicago: Rand McNally&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Maloney (1946) United States camera, Volume 10, Issue 11. p. 20. New York: U.S. Camera Publishing Corp.&lt;/ref&gt; She was barred from returning to the United States after the Italian government declared a general amnesty for collaborators in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lamparski (1968) Whatever became of…?

==Later life==
Zucca lived in relative obscurity in Italy until her death in 1998.&lt;ref name="historynet.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Wiener | first=Robert | date=March 21, 2012 | title=Both sides used radio as wartime weapon | url=http://www.njjewishnews.com/article/8761/both-sides-used-radio-as-wartime-weapon#.UwbgO_ldVow |newspaper=New Jersey Jewish News | accessdate=February 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Sarajevo Rose''' is a [[concrete]] scar caused by a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] [[Shell (projectile)|shell's]] explosion that was later filled with red [[resin]]. Mortar rounds landing on concrete create a unique fragmentation pattern that looks almost floral in arrangement. Because [[Sarajevo]] was a site of intense urban warfare and suffered thousands of shell explosions during the [[Siege of Sarajevo]], the marked concrete patterns are a unique feature to the city.

==Warfare==
As the capital city of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], Sarajevo was a central zone of conflict during the Bosnian War. The [[Army of Republika Srpska|Bosnian Serb Army]] deployed troops and artillery in the surrounding hills, and on 2 May 1992 began imposing a blockade on all traffic in and out the city, starting what was to be known as the [[siege of Sarajevo]]. The Bosnian Serb Army constantly bombarded the civilian population in the city in an effort to prevent the home army from deploying. It has been estimated that on an average day more than 300 shell rounds were fired into the city.

==Memorial==
Throughout the city, explosion marks have been filled with red resin to mark where mortar explosions resulted in one or more deaths.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

The Sarajevo roses are disappearing as the asphalt is replaced.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10432">The '''Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania''' or '''VLIK''' ({{lang-lt|Vyriausiasis Lietuvos išlaisvinimo komitetas}}) was an organization seeking independence of [[Lithuania]]. It was established on November 25, 1943, during the [[Occupation of Lithuania by Nazi Germany|Nazi occupation]]. After [[World War II]] it moved abroad and continued its operations in Germany and the United States. VLIK claimed to be the legal representative of the Lithuanian parliament and government, but did not enjoy international recognition. It was dissolved in 1990 when [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|Lithuania declared its independence]].

==In Lithuania==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Steponas Kairys.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Steponas Kairys, was the first chairman of the Committee]] --&gt;
When [[Nazi Germany]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded]] the [[Soviet Union]] in June 1941, [[Lithuanians]] greeted Germans as "liberators" from the oppressive Soviet regime. However, soon the attitude changed and various resistance movements began to form at the end of 1941 – beginning of 1942. During 1942 and 1943 these movements began consolidating into the pro-Catholic Nation's Council ({{lang-lt|Tautos taryba}}) and Supreme Committee of the Lithuanians ({{lang-lt|Vyriausiasis lietuvių komitetas}}).&lt;ref name=lt243&gt;{{cite book |editor=Arvydas Anušauskas|title=Lietuva, 1940–1990 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Lietuvos gyventojų genocido ir rezistencijos tyrimo centras]] |location=Vilnius |isbn=9986-757-65-7 |pages=243–244|language=lt|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a five-month discussion, these two organizations decided to established one unified organization – VLIK, representing a wide range of political views.&lt;ref name=lt243/&gt; The first meeting of VLIK was held on November 25, 1943 in [[Kaunas]] and [[Steponas Kairys]] was elected the first chairman.&lt;ref name=lt243/&gt; VLIK's mission was to act as an [[government in exile|underground government]] until restoration of the Lithuanian independence. VLIK sent its envoys to Sweden and Finland, maintained contacts with Lithuanian diplomats in Switzerland, and attempted to inform the western powers about the crimes perpetrated by the Nazis.&lt;ref name=lt243/&gt; VLIK published underground newspapers and agitated for [[passive resistance]] against the Nazis.&lt;ref name=vardys&gt;{{cite book|first=Vytas Stanley |last=Vardys |author2=Judith B.

In early 1944 VLIK sent colonel Kazimieras Amraziejus on a mission to [[Stockholm]], but he was captured and interrogated by the [[Gestapo]] in Estonia. This led to arrests of eight VLIK members on April 29–30, 1944.&lt;ref name=ger347&gt;{{cite book | last=Budreckis | first=Algirdas | editor=Albertas Gerutis | others=translated by Algirdas Budreckis | title=Lithuania: 700 Years | year=1984 | edition=6th | publisher=Manyland Books | location=New York | id={{LCC | 75-80057}} |isbn=0-87141-028-1 | pages=347–348 | chapter=Lithuanian Resistance, 1940–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, when the Soviets pushed the Germans from the [[Baltic states]] during the [[Baltic Offensive (1944)|Baltic Offensive]], most of VLIK members retreated to Germany and VLIK ceased its functions in Lithuania.&lt;ref name=lt243/&gt; VLIK originally designed three of its members to remain in Lithuania, but only one did. It was a strategic loss as communication with Lithuania was severed and there was very little contact with remaining resistance groups.&lt;ref name=ger347/&gt;

==In exile==
Functions of VLIK were resumed in October 1944 in [[Würzburg]], but soon moved to [[Reutlingen]] ahead of the approaching [[Red Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Budreckis | first=Algirdas | editor=Albertas Gerutis | others=translated by Algirdas Budreckis | title=Lithuania: 700 Years | year=1984 | edition=6th | publisher=Manyland Books | location=New York | id={{LCC | 75-80057}} |isbn=0-87141-028-1 | page=394 | chapter=Liberation Attempts from Abrod }}&lt;/ref&gt; VLIK remained in Reutlingen until 1955. [[Mykolas Krupavičius]] became the new chairman. VLIK united 15 different political organizations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor=Simas Sužiedėlis | encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] | title=Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania | year=1970–1978 | publisher=Juozas Kapočius | volume=V | location=Boston, Massachusetts | id={{LCC | 74-114275}} | pages=326–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose members held a variety of political views and that hindered decision making.&lt;ref name=lt376&gt;{{cite book |editor=Arvydas Anušauskas|title=Lietuva, 1940–1990 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Lietuvos gyventojų genocido ir rezistencijos tyrimo centras]] |location=Vilnius |isbn=9986-757-65-7 |pages=376–377|language=lt|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1945, before the [[Potsdam Conference]], VLIK sent memorandums to [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Harry S. Truman]] asking not to recognize Lithuania's occupation by the Soviet Union and asking for help reestablishing independent Lithuania.&lt;ref name=ger405&gt;{{cite book | last=Budreckis | first=Algirdas | editor=Albertas Gerutis | others=translated by Algirdas Budreckis | title=Lithuania: 700 Years | year=1984 | edition=6th | publisher=Manyland Books | location=New York | id={{LCC | 75-80057}} |isbn=0-87141-028-1 | pages=405–407 | chapter=Liberation Attempts from Abrod }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous further notes were sent to the [[United Nations]], various diplomats, academics, journalists promoting their cause and reporting [[Human rights in the Soviet Union|human right violations]] in Lithuania. VLIK also reestablished [[ELTA]] news service, including radio broadcasts.&lt;ref name=ger405/&gt; VLIK attempted to establish contacts with the [[Lithuanian partisans (1944–1953)|armed resistance in Lithuania]], but had only limited communication with [[Juozas Lukša]].

VLIK positioned itself as the Lithuanian [[Seimas]] (the parliament) and claimed that its executives were equivalent of a [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]].&lt;ref name=lt376/&gt; Despite its claims, VLIK was not recognized by any foreign country as a representative of Lithuania. It further claimed that Lithuanian diplomats, still active in pre-war embassies of independent Lithuania, were subordinates to VLIK.&lt;ref name=lt376/&gt; This caused decade-long disagreements with [[Stasys Lozoraitis]], who was in charge of the diplomatic service and had a back-dated appointment as Prime Minister by the last President of Lithuania [[Antanas Smetona]]. This tension was one of the reasons why the Lithuanians were unable to form a recognized [[government-in-exile]].&lt;ref name=lt387&gt;{{cite book |editor=Arvydas Anušauskas|title=Lietuva, 1940–1990 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Lietuvos gyventojų genocido ir rezistencijos tyrimo centras]] |location=Vilnius |isbn=9986-757-65-7 |page=387|language=lt|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several attempts were made to ease the tension between VLIK (representing the nation) and the diplomatic service (representing the state).&lt;ref name=ger405/&gt; The first was a conference in [[Berne]] in July 1946. It was decided to form an Executive Council, but it never took off.&lt;ref name=lt38806&gt;{{cite book |editor=Arvydas Anušauskas|title=Lietuva, 1940–1990 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Lietuvos gyventojų genocido ir rezistencijos tyrimo centras]] |location=Vilnius |isbn=9986-757-65-7 |page=380|language=lt|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second conference was held in [[Paris]] in August 1947. 

As war refugees moved out of the [[displaced persons camp]]s to the United States, VLIK also moved its headquarters to [[New York City]] in 1955. After the move, VLIK's political agenda became less prominent. The activists realized that there will be no quick solution to the [[Cold War]]. VLIK's main goal was to maintain non-recognition of Lithuania’s occupation and dissemination of information from behind the [[iron curtain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mintautas |last=Bložė |url=http://www.lfpr.lt/uploads/File/2000-5/Lietuvos_diplomatija.pdf |title=Lietuvos diplomatija XX amžiuje (review) |journal=Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review |year=2000 |volume=1 |issue=5 |issn=1392-5504 |page=4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722135924/http://www.lfpr.lt/uploads/File/2000-5/Lietuvos_diplomatija.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; VLIK established the [[Lithuanian World Community]] with a mission to promote Lithuanian language and culture among Lithuanians living abroad.

The '''Syrian Revolution Coordinators Union''' or (SYRCU) ({{lang-ar|اتحاد تنسيقيات الثورة السورية}}) is an organization with members from different protest coordination groups from all around Syria. Its members represent their areas and cities for the activities of the Syrian uprising that began in 2011 against the Syrian government. The Syrian Revolution Coordinators Union'' has been active since the beginning of the revolution in [[Nonviolent resistance|peaceful resistance]]

The Union includes more than 216 coordination group, local council and group of activists of the protests in Syria. It aims to "end to the ruling of the 40-years-old [[al-Assad family]] ruling Syria, particularly after that government started using lethal force against peaceful protest asking for reform and freedom in May 2011 in the southern Syrian city of [[Daraa]]". The '''SRCU''' aims to "build Syria as country of [[democracy]] and [[rule of law]]; where [[civil rights|civil]] and [[human rights]] are obeyed by citizens and authorities".

== Supporting Social Journalism==
The Union has helped a number of individual activists and social journalists to relay the news about their areas by providing basic equipment and training.

== Projects ==
* Syrian FM opposition radio station.
* The ROP Project (Will be launched soon)

== Humanitarian &amp; Medical Work ==
The '''Syrian Revolution Coordinators Union''' has conducted, through its local humanitarian and medical member groups, many humanitarian activities and field hospitals equipment. Particularly since the government's activities has practically disabled the work of any Syrian or foreign NGOs to help injured people and refugees.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} The '''SRCU''' has provided through donors inside and out [[Syria]] a number of food boxes, shift clinic equipment and medical supplies to different areas in distress.

Since the beginning of the [[Syrian uprising (2011–present)|Syrian uprising]] against the government, any civilian or protester injured by the regime forces, army or [[Shabiha]] militias will have to be treated by volunteer medics or doctors in improvised sites, houses or dedicated shift clinics.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Equipping and hiding field treatment locations has been one of the most threatening and resources consuming task during the uprising.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} The government security forces in a number of occasions used local paid informants to locate and destroy treatment locations equipped by the SRCU.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}



== SYRCU Approach ==

The '''Syrian Revolution Coordinators Union''' (SYRCU) is a civilian, non-for-profit entity that gathers coordinators of anti-government protests from all around Syria.
The SYRCU claims it believes in "protests, strikes, social campaigns, civil disobedience and other non-violent tools as the most efficient ones to achieve the goal of the [[Syrian uprising (2011–present)|Syrian revolution]]". The SYRCU also believes that this is the best life-saving approach in the Syrian people struggle to achieve democracy and build Syria as a country for everyone to share, rather than just a single family to control, i.e. Assad Family.

Even though we the SYRCU does not take up arms to for their cause, they still believe in the legitimacy of the fight that defected officers and soldiers, ex-military personnel and other have decided to take. Those people who are now called the [[Free Syrian Army]] (FSA) have seen families murdered in cold blood in front in their own eyes and decided that they should defend their neighborhoods, families and property using a lethal forces that is so little compared to that used by the [[Assad family]] government.

The '''Syrian Revolution Coordinators Union''' (SYRCU) believes that medical care and humanitarian aid should be provided to any one in need regardless of their belonging. This even applies to arrested soldiers who were just fighting to the Assad government's side. They also believe and approve of the International conventions in this regard, including but not limited to the four Geneva Conventions and the three protocols agreed upon after them.

The SYRCU also believes that the international community, represented by its major entities like the United Nations, the Arab League and others, are and should be always responsible for making everyone who commits crimes against the Syrian people become accounted by the law. They have supported all the plans presented by the international community in such context including the initiative by Kofi Anan that aimed to end the violence and release all prisoners.
Considering all the plans that have been presented, the SYRCU has made it clear several times before that it aims for exactly the same points. The SYRCU believe in its rights to keep its social movement and refuse any dialogue with the government before it withdraws the army from the cities, release all political prisoners and activists, confess to the crimes it did and become prepared to hand-over the power in Syria.

'''Zuism''' or '''Sumerian-Mesopotamian Neopaganism'''{{refn|group=note|The name '''Zuism''' has become the most common descriptor for the modern movement of Sumerian-Mesopotamian religion, being the name under which the religion has been recognised by the Icelandic government since 2013. Other descriptors have been used, by minor informal groups which existed before the recognition under Icelandic law. These synonyms include '''Sumerian-Mesopotamian Neopaganism''' or '''Sumerian-Mesopotamian Reconstructionism''', '''Babylonian Neopaganism''' or '''Babylonian Reconstructionism''', and '''Kaldanism''' ("way of the Chaldeans").{{sfnm|1a1=Ansbrandt|1y=2018a|2a1=Ansbrandt|2y=2018b|2loc=zuism.it version, note i}}}} define a [[modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] [[religion|religious]] movement based on the [[Sumerian religion]] (and later [[ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian religion]]s which continued it),{{sfn|Bromley|2018}} and calls itself the "oldest religion, foundation of all major religions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How it all began|url=http://zuist.org/about/our-story/|website=Zuism International|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123195316/http://zuist.org/about/our-story/|archive-date=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Sumerian-Mesopotamian religious groups already existed since the 1980s;{{sfn|Ansbrandt|2018a}} however, the first institutional form of the movement was founded in [[Iceland]] in 2010 by Ólafur Helgi Þorgrímsson, and in 2013 Zuism was registered among the religions recognised by the Icelandic government.{{sfn|Bromley|2018}} After the mid-2010s, branches of the church were established in other countries of central and northern Europe.{{sfn|Bromley|2018}}

In late 2015 the Zuist Church of Iceland was taken over by a new leadership, under which the church was turned into a medium for a mass protest against the nationally mandated tax on religious membership; Icelanders began converting in large numbers as the new leadership promised that the tax received by the Zuist Church would have been used to refund the church members themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Harriet Sherwood|title=Icelanders flock to religion revering Sumerian deities and tax rebates|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/08/new-icelandic-religion-sumerian-gods-tax-rebates-zuism|website=The Guardian|date=8 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220220005/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/08/new-icelandic-religion-sumerian-gods-tax-rebates-zuism|archive-date=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a legal struggle, in 2017 the original directors of the church were restored to power.

==Terminology==
Modern Sumerian-Mesopotamin religion has been known as "Zuism", "Sumerian-Mesopotamian Neopaganism" or "Sumerian-Mesopotamian Reconstructionism", "Babylonian Neopaganism" or "Babylonian Reconstructionism", and "Kaldanism" (which means "way of Chaldeans", [[Chaldea]] being a late term for [[Sumer]]). Among them, Zuism has become the most popular descriptor for the movement, by virtue of being the name under which the religion is recognised by Icelandic law.{{sfn|Ansbrandt|2018a}}

Zuism is defined as an international religious movement which intends to represent all the groups professing Sumerian-Mesopotamian religions. The Zuist Church of Iceland, the orgaisation recognised by the Icelandic government, has established branches throughout various countries and intends to be a platform for all Zuist believers. Many Zuists and Sumerian-Mesopotamian Neopagans are contributing to the development of the movement both within and outside the Zuist Church.{{sfn|Ansbrandt|2018a}}

The name "Zuism" originates from the Sumerian verb ''zu'' {{cuneiform|𒍪}}, meaning "to know",{{sfn|Wolfe|2015}} and is defined as a "way of knowledge", of knowing the appropriate modality of being human, in harmony with divinity. It is equated with the Greek term ''[[gnosis]]''.{{sfn|Ansbrandt|2018a}} The term ''zu'' may also refer to the thunder-bird god of wisdom, ''[[Anzû|Zû]]'',&lt;ref name="bfmtv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mais pourquoi des milliers d'Islandais se convertissent au zuisme?|url=http://www.bfmtv.com/international/mais-pourquoi-des-milliers-d-islandais-se-convertissent-au-zuisme-936288.html|website=BFMTV|date=11 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220220657/http://www.bfmtv.com/international/mais-pourquoi-des-milliers-d-islandais-se-convertissent-au-zuisme-936288.html|archive-date=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; servant of [[Enlil]].

— The medium-blue ring between the inner Path of Enlil and the outer Path of Enki is the "Path of An".{{sfn|Didier|2009|pp=95, Vol. I}}&lt;/small&gt;]]
Zuism is defined as the knowledge on how to appropriately stand in-between Heaven ({{cuneiform|𒀭}} ''An'' or ''Dingir'') and Earth ({{cuneiform|𒆠}} ''Ki''), by acting in accordance with the creative word ({{cuneiform|𒌓}} ''utu'') and the measures ({{cuneiform|𒈨}} ''me'') represented by the gods ({{cuneiform|𒀭}} ''dingir''), all constituting the energetic ''[[logos]]'' ({{cuneiform|𒆤}} ''lil'') of Heaven.{{sfn|Ansbrandt|2018a}}

===Theology===
Gods are held to be immortal beings, who are human-like and yet invisible to human eyes. They are potencies who guide the development of the universe. The four main divine beings are:&lt;ref name=is.zuist-kennisetningar&gt;{{cite web|title=Kennisetningar Zuism|url=http://is.zuist.org/about/our-mission/|website=Zuism Iceland|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116084124/http://is.zuist.org/about/our-mission/|archive-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ① the [[universe|universal]] god ''[[Anu (god)|An]]''/''[[Dingir]]'' (literally "Heaven"/"God", astrally identified as the [[orbital pole|ecliptic]] north [[celestial pole]] encompassed by the coil of the constellation [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]], and with all the constellations spinning around it;{{sfn|Rogers|1998|p=21}}{{sfn|Didier|2009|pp=261–265, Vol. III}} the [[Ursa Minor|Little Bear]] is his chariot, ''Mar.gid.da.an.na'', the "Chariot of Heaven"{{sfn|Rogers|1998|p=18}}), ② ''[[Ki (goddess)|Ki]]'' or ''[[Ninhursag]]'' (literally "Earth" or "Lady of the Mountain"), ③ ''[[Enki]]'' (literally "Lord of the Squared Earth", the god of water and craft, astrally identified as ''Aš.iku'' or ''Mul.iku'', the "Field", that is the [[Square of Pegasus]], and generally with the southern sky—called Path of Enki—, that is to say the circle farther from the north celestial pole An{{sfn|Rogers|1998|p=21}}{{sfn|Didier|2009|pp=95, Vol. I}}) and ④ ''[[Enlil]]'' (literally "Lord of the Storm", the god of weather and thunder, identified as ''Mul.apin'', the "Plough", that is the constellation [[Triangulum]], and generally with the northern sky—called Path of Enlil—, that is to say the circle nearest to the north celestial pole An; his wife ''[[Ninlil]]'', literally "Lady of the Storm", is ''Mar.gid.da'', the "[[Big Dipper|Chariot]]"{{sfn|Rogers|1998|p=18}}{{sfn|Didier|2009|pp=95, Vol. I}}). Sky, earth, air and water are thus considered the fundamental elements of the cosmos.&lt;ref name=is.zuist-kennisetningar/&gt;

Lesser deities include&lt;ref name=is.zuist-kennisetningar/&gt; [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]] (the moon), [[Utu]] (the sun), [[Marduk]] (represented with a sword and a dragon, astrally identified as [[Jupiter]],{{sfn|Rogers|1998|p=12}} and also associated with the north celestial pole An{{sfn|Didier|2009|p=265, Vol. III}}), [[Nabu]] (god of writing and wisdom, astrally identified as [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]{{sfn|Rogers|1998|p=12}}), [[Nergal]] (god of the underworld and plagues, astrally identified as [[Mars]]{{sfn|Rogers|1998|p=12}}), [[Ninurta]] (god of war and farming, astrally identified as [[Saturn]]{{sfn|Rogers|1998|p=13}}), [[Inanna]] (goddess of love, beauty, creativity and war; astrally identified as [[Venus]]{{sfn|Rogers|1998|p=11}}) and [[Tammuz (mythology)|Dumuzi]] (shepherd god of death and resurrection, astrally identified as [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]]{{sfn|Rogers|1998|p=14}}).

===Ethics and scripture recitation===
The universe is created by the gods through the word, ''utu'' ({{cuneiform|𒌓}}), and developed through the measures, ''[[me (mythology)|me]]'' {{cuneiform|𒈨}}.{{sfn|Earliest Leaders of Zuism Iceland|2010}}&lt;ref name=is.zuist-kennisetningar&gt;{{cite web|title=Kennisetningar Zuism|url=http://is.zuist.org/about/our-mission/|website=Zuism Iceland|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116084124/http://is.zuist.org/about/our-mission/|archive-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The divine word (''utu'') which has performative power, is the power to create. By the words of the founders and earliest leaders, the "act of creation ... was accomplished through utterance of the divine word". The deity "had merely to make plans and pronounce the name of the thing to be created".{{sfn|Earliest Leaders of Zuism Iceland|2010}} The measures (''me'') are "universal and unchangeable rules and laws that all beings are obliged to obey", which "keep the cosmos in continuous and harmonious operation and ... avoid confusion and conflict".{{sfn|Earliest Leaders of Zuism Iceland|2010}}

Belief and practice of Zuism is based on Sumerian poems, which Zuists recite in their worship services in honour of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Icelanders flocking to the Zuist religion|url=http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2015/12/01/icelanders_flocking_to_the_zuist_religion/|website=Iceland Monitor|date=1 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220220248/http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2015/12/01/icelanders_flocking_to_the_zuist_religion/|archive-date=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular gatherings are held for such scripture recitation in honour of the gods, as well as for prayers, which are either personal or for the welfare of others. Believers conduct their daily life according to the ''me'', which in human society are ethical codes modeled after the laws of the universe, and govern every aspect of morality from individual to social economy.&lt;ref name=is.zuist-kennisetningar/&gt;

Zuism is a "social religion", meaning that men and gods are considered symbiotic parts of the same complex whole. Gods govern the fate of men, and relationship with them may not be forsaken. Chiefs and priests are responsible for upkeeping the relationship with the gods through daily, monthly and yearly ordinances held at temples. Priests are called ''en'', ''ensi'' and ''[[lugal]]''.&lt;ref name=is.zuist-kennisetningar/&gt;

===Annulment of debt and wealth redistribution===
{{Further|Ama-gi}}
According to the Zuist Church, [[Sumer]] had the earliest tax system in the history of civilisation for which archeological attestations exist; it was called ''bala''. Sumerians were aware of the threat posed to economies by the accumulation of debt, and for this reason debt was regularly annulled. This practice was called ''amagi'' ({{cuneiform|𒂼𒄄}}) or ''amargi'' ({{cuneiform|𒂼𒅈𒄄}}), literally "return to the mother", and the Zuist Church aims to restore it for today, starting with the redistribution among members of the wealth received through the tax on religious membership which governments—including that of Iceland—impose on their citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amargi (Endurgreiðsla Sóknargjalda)|url=http://zuism.is/endurgreidsla-soknargjalda/|website=Zúistar á Íslandi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229135343/http://zuism.is/endurgreidsla-soknargjalda/|archive-date=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charity====
The members of the Zuist Church of Iceland may choose whether to devolve their paid taxes to charity.&lt;ref name=zuism.is-24Oct/&gt; In 2017, the Zuist Church devolved funds to a number of social welfare organisations: 1.1 million [[Icelandic crown]]s were donated to the Circle Children's Hospital (''Barnaspítala Hringsins''), 1 million to the Women's Shelter (''Kvennaathvarfsins''), and 300 thousand Icelandic crowns to the emergency fund of the [[UNICEF]].&lt;ref name=zuism.is-8Dec/&gt; With the help of its members, according to the leader Ágúst Arnar Ágústsson, the Zuist Church may become "a long-term sponsor of such organisations".&lt;ref name=zuism.is-24Oct/&gt;

==Temple and burial ground==
[[File:Ekur of Enlil, Reykjavík.jpg|thumb|400px|Project of the Ekur of [[Enlil]] to be built in Reykjavík.]]
On 16 January 2018, the Zuist Church of Iceland applied for the allocation of a plot of land in [[Reykjavík]] for the burial of its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkjugardar.is/pdf/fundargerdir/20180116.pdf|title=Fundargerð framkvæmdastjórnar KGR|publisher=Cemeteries of Reykjavík Deanery (Kirkjugaðar Reykjavíkurprófastsdæma – KGRP)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180609014420/http://www.kirkjugardar.is/pdf/fundargerdir/20180116.pdf|archive-date=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 May of the same year, the Zuists of Iceland presented the project and applied for the allocation of land for building a temple in the capital, which will be called the Ekur of Enlil (literally "Mount-Court of Enlil" or "Temple-Mount of Enlil"). It will function as the headquarters of the Zuist Church and as the main site for religious rituals, including baptisms and weddings. The temple will be on three levels, a ground floor and a first floor dedicated to community activities, and a shrine to the deity on the second floor. The Zuist Church opened a "fund for the ziggurat" (''Zigguratsjóð'') to which members will choose whether to devolve their taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zuism sækir um lóð í Reykjavík|url=http://zuism.is/2018/05/29/zuism-saekir-um-lod-i-reykjavik/|website=Zúistar á Íslandi|date=29 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180609014312/http://zuism.is/2018/05/29/zuism-saekir-um-lod-i-reykjavik/|archive-date=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===1980s–2000s===
Before the establishment of the Zuist Church in Iceland, there were already some Zuist or Sumerian-Mesopotamian Neopagan groups, mostly small and informal, many of which still exist, including the Temple of Sumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://templeofsumer.com/|title=Temple of Sumer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sumerian-Mesopotamian contemporary [[new religious movement]], indeed, dates back at least to the 1980s.{{sfn|Ansbrandt|2018a}} According to the Zuist Church of Iceland, its history may be further traced back well before the 2010s to a "mother church" of Icelandic believers who dwelt in [[Delaware]], [[United States]].{{sfn|Ansbrandt|2018a}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sagan okkar|url=http://is.zuist.org/about/our-story/|website=Zuism Iceland|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116080208/http://is.zuist.org/about/our-story/|archive-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zuist Church of Iceland====
=====2013–2014: official registration and Ágúst Arnar's leadership=====
Zuism became a recognised religion in Iceland in 2013, when Icelandic law was amended to allow further non-Christian religions to be registered with the state.{{sfn|Bromley|2018}} The Zuist Church was founded years before, in 2010, by Ólafur Helgi Þorgrímsson,{{sfn|Bromley|2018}} who left it at an early stage of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dularfyllsta trúfélag á Íslandi verður brottfellt á næstunni|url=https://stundin.is/frett/dularfyllsta-trufelag-islandi-verdur-brottfellt-na/|website=Stundin|date=14 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220221047/https://stundin.is/frett/dularfyllsta-trufelag-islandi-verdur-brottfellt-na/|archive-date=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current head priest of the Zuist Church of Iceland is Ágúst Arnar Ágústsson,&lt;ref name="Syslumenn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syslumenn.is/thjonusta/utgefin-leyfi/listi-yfir-skrad-trufelog-og-lifsskodunarfelog/|title=Listi yfir skráð trúfélög og lífsskoðunarfélög|publisher=[[Sýslumaður|Sýslumenn]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; who took on the office in September 2014.&lt;ref name=zuism.is-24Oct&gt;{{cite web|title=Yfirlýsing frá Ágústi Arnari Ágústsssyni, forstöðumanni trúfélagsins Zuism|url=http://zuism.is/2017/10/24/yfirlysing-fra-agusti-arnari-agustsssyni-forstodumanni-trufelagsins-zuism/|website=Zúistar á Íslandi|date=24 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220221401/http://zuism.is/2017/10/24/yfirlysing-fra-agusti-arnari-agustsssyni-forstodumanni-trufelagsins-zuism/|archive-date=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a Swiss branch, the Zuist Church of Switzerland, was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ch.zuist.org/|title=Zuism Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on Christianity and Sitchinianism==
According to the independent Zuist author Uligang Ansbrandt, Christianity (viewed as corrupted and dying in its modern forms) and Islam are "false religions, or non-religions", as they "fail to relink Heaven, Earth and humanity" — the word "religion" is derived from the common root of the Latin verbs ''religere'' (careful "re-reading" or "re-collecting" right practices) and ''religare'' ("re-linking"), according, respectively, to the etymologies provided by [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'' and [[Lactantius]]' ''[[The Divine Institutes|Divinae Institutiones]]''.{{sfn|Ansbrandt|2018b|p=2, notes i and iii}} The Zuist vision of God is presented as a thisworldly one, in which God is "the starry sky and its cycles". The God as conceived by Abrahamic religions in instead presented as a "non-existing, otherworldly abstract thing".{{sfn|Ansbrandt|2018b|p=2, note i}} The author also rejects [[Zecharia Sitchin|Sitchinianism]], defined as another "abstract, nonsense science fiction", a misinterpretation of ancient knowledge which is worryingly "very popular nowadays".{{sfn|Ansbrandt|2018b|p=2, note i}}
