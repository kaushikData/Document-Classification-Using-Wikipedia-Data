The '''Aargau Jura Park''' is located north of [[Aarau]], between the rivers Aare and Rhine, in the [[cantons of Switzerland|Swiss canton]] of [[Aargau]]. It straddles the border between [[canton of Jura|Jura]] and [[Basel]]. It spans {{convert|244|km2|sqmi}} and reaches up to {{convert|350|m}} above the valley floor.&lt;ref name="spn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Portrait: Jurapark Aargau|url=http://www.paerke.ch/en/pdf/portrait/aktuell/jurapark_portrt_en.pdf|publisher=Swiss Parks Network|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park is mainly located on the Jurassic Plateau, between [[Frick, Aargau|Frick]] and [[Villigen]], and also encompasses the Aargau Jura mountains and valleys. The northern area includes sparse pine forests, fruit orchards, rocky steppes, dry meadows and terraced vineyards, while the southern region fosters forests and wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aargau Jura Park|url=http://www.myswitzerland.com/en/the-aargau-jura.html|publisher=MySwitzerland|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was declared a regional nature park of national importance in 2012 by the [[Federal Office for the Environment]]. 

The villages Herznach and Wölfinswil traditionally mined ore in the park and thus, left many studs. A mining tunnel was excavated and made accessible to visitors.

'''Aberdeen Falls''' is a {{Convert|98|m|ft|abbr=on}} high [[waterfall]] on the [[Kehelgamu Oya]] near [[Ginigathena]], in the [[Nuwara Eliya District]] of [[Sri Lanka]]. Aberdeen is named after [[Aberdeen]], the third largest city in [[Scotland]] and the capital of [[Aberdeenshire]]. [[Kehelgamu Oya]] is a major tributary of the [[Kelani River]]. 

To reach Aberdeen Falls from Ginigathena town, one then must proceed along Ambatale Road up to the Buddha statue at the end of the road. Then one should park their vehicle and walk about 1.2&amp;nbsp;km along the road. Bathing in the middle of the pool and swimming to the middle has caused death to swimmers in the past. This waterfall is covered with a big stone complex behind. The waterfall is ranked as the [[List of waterfalls in Sri Lanka|18th highest on the Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sena04|Senanayake 2004]]: 1&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="547">'''Aces''' ({{lang-grc|Ἄκης}}), is a river of Asia, flowing through a plain surrounded by mountains, respecting which a story is told by [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Herodotus|3.117.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographers are not agreed as to the locality. It seems to be somewhere in Central Asia, east of the Caspian. It is pretty clear, at all events, that the Aces of Herodotus is not the Indian river [[Acesines]] (modern Chenab).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27212">'''[[Azerbaijan]]''' is administratively divided into the following subdivisions:
*59 '''[[district]]s''' (''rayonlar''; sing.– ''[[raion|rayon]]''), 
*11 '''[[City|cities]]''' (''şəhərlər''; sing.– ''[[şəhər]]''), 
*1 '''[[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|autonomous republic]]''' (''muxtar respublika''), which itself contains:
**7 districts
**1 city

The rayons are further divided into [[Municipality|municipalities]] (''Bələdiyyəsi'').

Additionally, Azerbaijan is subdivided into 9 (economic) regions (''İqtisadi Rayonar''; sing.– ''İqtisadi Rayonu'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://azregionaldevelopment.az/en/regionlar.html "Azerbaijan Regions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160224095453/http://azregionaldevelopment.az/en/regionlar.html |date=2016-02-24 }}, Regional Development Center in Azerbaijan.&lt;/ref&gt;
This is not an administrative division. Each region contains a number of districts. The Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic forms a separate, the 10th economic region.

The territory of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] presently forms part of [[Azerbaijan]]i ''rayons'' [[Khojavend District|Khojavend]], [[Shusha District|Shusha]], [[Khojaly District|Khojaly]], the east portion of [[Kalbajar District|Kalbajar]] and the west portion of [[Tartar District|Tartar]]. In Soviet times the region was known as [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]]; however on November 26, 1991, the [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|Parliament of the Azerbaijan SSR]] [[Law on Abolishment of Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast|abolished the autonomous status of the NKAO]]. Since then the territory of the autonomous oblast has been administratively split between the aforementioned rayons.

As a result of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], most of its territory is now under the control of ethnic Armenian forces from [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] and [[Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The self-proclaimed [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]] (NKR) also controls a large part of southwestern Azerbaijan outside Nagorno-Karabakh. The Azerbaijani rayons completely or partially in the NKR are noted in the list. The NKR does not recognise these rayons and has its [[Administrative divisions of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|own system of administrative division]].

The list below is for the main part of Azerbaijan, excluding the rayons of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.

{{about|Caledonia as the Latin name for Scotland}}
[[File:Caledonia by Wm Hole.JPG|thumb|Personification of Caledonia by the Victorian artist [[William Hole (artist)|William Hole]]]]
'''Caledonia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|æ|l|ɪ|ˈ|d|oʊ|n|i|ə}}) is the [[Latin]] name given by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] to the land in today's [[Scotland]], north of their [[Roman province|province]] of ''[[Roman Britain|Britannia]]'', beyond the [[Borders of the Roman Empire|frontier]] of their [[Roman Empire|empire]]. The etymology of the name is probably from a [[Gallo-Brittonic languages|P-Celtic]] source. Its modern usage is as a romantic or poetic name for Scotland as a whole, comparable with [[Hibernia]] for [[Ireland]] and [[Cambria]] for Wales.

== Original usage ==
The original use of the name, by [[Tacitus]], [[Ptolemy]], [[Lucan]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], referred to the area (or parts of the area) later known as ''Pictavia'' or [[Picts|Pictland]] north of [[Hadrian's Wall]] in today's Scotland.{{sfn|Moffat|2005|pp=21-22}} The name may be related to that of a large central Pictish tribe, the ''[[Caledonians|Caledonii]]'', one amongst several in the area and perhaps the dominant tribe, which would explain the binomial Caledonia/Caledonii.

[[File:Schiehallion NW ridge.jpg|thumb|The north-west ridge of [[Schiehallion]], the "fairy hill of the Caledonians".]]

The name of the Caledonians may be found in [[toponymy]], such as ''Dùn Chailleann'', the [[Scottish Gaelic]] word for the town of [[Dunkeld]] meaning "fort of the Caledonii", and possibly in that of the [[Munro|mountain]] ''[[Schiehallion|Sìdh Chailleann]]'', the "fairy hill of the Caledonians".{{sfn|Bennet|1985|p=26}}{{sfn|Watson|2004|p=21}} According to ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' the site of the seventh battle of the mythical [[King Arthur|Arthur]] was a forest in what is now Scotland, called ''Coit Celidon'' in early Welsh.{{sfn|Lacy|Ashe|Mancoff|1997|p=298}}{{sfn|Koch|2006|p=332}}

=== Etymology ===
According to Zimmer (2006), Caledonia is derived from the tribal name ''Caledones'' (or ''Calīdones''), which he etymologises as {{"'}}possessing hard feet', alluding to standfastness or endurance", from the [[Proto-Celtic]] roots ''*kal-'' "hard" and ''*φēdo-'' "foot".{{sfn|Zimmer|2006|pp=163–167}}

=== Location ===
The exact location of what the Romans called Caledonia in the early stages of Britannia is uncertain, and the boundaries are unlikely to have been fixed until the building of [[Hadrian's Wall]]. From then onwards, Caledonia stood to the north of the wall, and to the south was the Roman province of Britannia (consisting of most of what is now England and Wales).&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{harvtxt|Haverfield|1911|p=987}} in Encyclopædia Britannica, though, states that "a tribe of Caledones" are "named by the geographer Ptolemy as living within boundaries which are now unascertainable".&lt;/ref&gt; During the brief Roman military incursions into central and northern Scotland,&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{harvtxt|Hanson|2003|p=198}} states that the military presence of Rome lasted for little more than 40 years for most of Scotland and only as much as 80 years in total anywhere. At no time was even half of Scotland's land mass under Roman control.&lt;/ref&gt; the Scottish Lowlands were indeed absorbed into the province of Britannia, and the name was also used by the Romans, prior to their conquest of the southern and central parts of the island, to refer to the whole island of Great Britain.

[[File:Britain.north.peoples.Ptolemy.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of the populations in northern Britain, based on the testimony of [[Ptolemy]].]]

Once the Romans had built a second wall further to the north (the [[Antonine Wall]]) and their garrisons advanced north likewise, the developing [[Romano-British culture|Roman-Britons]] south of the wall had trade relations with the [[Picts]] north of the wall, as testified by archaeological evidence, much of it available at the [[National Museum of Scotland]] in Edinburgh.

== Modern usage ==
The modern use of "Caledonia" in English and [[Scots language|Scots]] is either as a historical description of northern Britain during the Roman era or as a romantic or poetic name for Scotland as a whole.{{sfn|Koch|2006|p=332}}{{sfn|Keay|Keay|1994|p=123}}

The name has been widely used by organisations and commercial entities. Notable examples include [[Glasgow Caledonian University]], ferry operator [[Caledonian MacBrayne]], and the now-defunct [[British Caledonian]] airline and [[Caledonian Railway]]. The [[Caledonian Sleeper]] is an overnight [[train]] service from London to Scottish destinations. The [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.]] is a professional [[association football|football]] club. In music, "[[Caledonia (song)|Caledonia]]" is a popular [[folk music|folk]] [[ballad]] written by [[Dougie MacLean]] in 1977 and published in 1979 on an album of the same name; it has since been covered by various other artists, most notably [[Frankie Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=1021&amp;id=1145252003 |title=Rock and roll years: the 1970s |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=16 October 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031228163008/http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=1021&amp;id=1145252003# |archivedate=2003-12-28 |access-date=2009-01-17 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dougiemaclean.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=71 |title=Biography |work=Dougiemaclean.com |accessdate=17 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The web series ''Caledonia'' and associated novel is a supernatural police drama that takes place in Glasgow, Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/new-detective-drama-set-to-hit-our-screens-148142n.23126482 |title=New detective drama set to hit our screens |work=[[Evening Times]] |first=Brian |last=Beacom |date=14 January 2014 |accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/television-reviews/9530-caledonia |title=Caledonia |work=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]] |first=Andrew |last=Marshall |date=26 August 2014 |accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ptolemy's account also referred to the ''Caledonia Silva'', an idea still recalled in the modern expression "[[Caledonian Forest]]", although the woods are much reduced in size since Roman times.{{sfn|Smout|MacDonald|Watson|2007|pp=20-25}}&lt;ref group=note&gt;The extent of the reduction is a matter of debate. This association with a ''Silva'' (literally the flora) reinforces the idea that Caledonia was a forest or forested area named after the Caledonii, or that the people were named after the woods in which they dwelt.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars point out that the name "Scotland" is ultimately derived from [[Scotia]], a Latin term first used for Ireland (also called [[Hibernia]] by the Romans) and later for Scotland, the [[Scoti]] peoples having originated in Ireland and resettled in Scotland.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Bede used a Latin form of the word Scots as the name of the [[Gaels]] of [[Dál Riata]]. {{harv|Bede, the Venerable Saint|1999|p=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, post-conquest, Roman name for the island of Great Britain was [[Albion]], which is [[cognate]] with the Scottish Gaelic name for Scotland: ''[[Alba]]''.

'''Cerro El Pital''' is a mountain in [[Central America]], on the border of [[El Salvador]] and [[Honduras]]. It is located {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} from the town of [[La Palma, Chalatenango|La Palma]] at a height of {{convert|2730|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, and is the highest point in  Salvadoran territory. Cerro El Pital is in the middle of a [[cloud forest]] that has an average annual temperature of {{convert|10|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="MINTUR2"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Ministerio de Turismo de la República de El Salvador |title=Cerro El Pital |url=http://www.elsalvadorturismo.gob.sv/pital.htm |year=2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502170351/http://www.elsalvadorturismo.gob.sv/pital.htm |archivedate=2 May 2006 |accessdate=17 February 2009 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of the most popular tourist draws in El Salvador, with great biodiversity in a wide altitudinal range containing many endangered species of flora and fauna. The cloud forest has some of the rarest plants and animals in the country, including [[quetzal]]s and other endangered species.

From November to February the temperature ranges between {{convert|−6|C|F}} and {{convert|10|C|F}} (lowest recorded, in January 1956) and in the rest of the year the temperature ranges between {{convert|5|C|F}} and {{convert|17|C|F}}. It is the coldest place in [[El Salvador]].  On 13 April 2004, much of the mountain was blanketed by an accumulation of hail during a storm, an unusual event that caused a commotion among the local community.&lt;ref name="Villarroel"&gt;{{cite news |first=Nathalie |last=Villarroel |title=El cerro El Pital fue cubierto por escarcha |date=13 April 2004 |url=http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2004/04/13/elpais/pais6.asp |work=[[El Diario de Hoy]] |accessdate=17 February 2009 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chalk heath''' is a rare habitat, in the [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] [[biome]], formed of a paradoxical mixture of shallow-rooted [[calcifuge]] ("calcium-hating") and deeper-rooted [[calcicole]] ("calcium-loving") plants, growing on a thin layer of [[acid]]ic soil over an [[alkali]]ne substrate.  Chalk heath is intermediate between two much more widespread habitats, [[calcareous grassland|chalk grassland]] and [[Heath (habitat)|heathland]].

==Ecology==
Chalk heath occurs where a thin layer of acidic soil (often [[loess]] or [[sand]]) overlies a [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] (alkaline) one, such as [[chalk]].  Shallow-[[root]]ed plants grow only in the acidic soil (typically a few centimetres thick), and so these are species characteristic of acidic habitats.  Deeper-rooted plants can reach the underlying alkaline substrate, and so these include species characteristic of alkaline habitats.  Plants also occur which are able to tolerate both acidic and basic conditions.  There are no plants restricted entirely to chalk heath, and the animals are also those characteristic of chalk grassland and heathland.  The vegetation structure of chalk heath resembles [[grass heath]], being short grassy vegetation with heather growing up through it, with some scattered heather bushes.

Chalk heath often occurs at the tops of slopes, at the thin margins of acidic deposits which often cap the flatter tops of chalk hills.  It usually gives way to chalk grassland on lower slopes where these deposits have been eroded away, and often to heathland on the hilltops where the acidic deposits are thicker.  Chalk heath tends to occur as narrow strips and scattered fragments, being limited to places where the conditions are exactly right for its development and survival.

Chalk heath is a [[grazing]] habitat, created and maintained by [[livestock]] (usually [[sheep]] and [[cattle]]) and [[European Rabbit|rabbit]]s.

==Vegetation==
Chalk heath in southern [[Great Britain|Britain]] includes calcicoles such as [[salad burnet]] (''Sanguisorba minor''), dropwort (''[[Filipendula vulgaris]]'') and common milkwort (''[[Polygala vulgaris]]''), and calcifuges such as bell heather (''[[Erica cinerea]]''), ling heather (''[[Calluna]] vulgaris''), heath grass (''[[Danthonia decumbens]]''), [[sheep's sorrel]] (''Rumex acetosella'') and betony (''[[Stachys officinalis]]'').  It also includes plants which can tolerate both acidic and basic conditions, such as common bent (''[[Agrostis capillaris]]''), wood sage (''[[Teucrium scorodonia]]'') and sometimes juniper (''[[Juniperus communis]]'').

==Conservation==
Chalk heath has suffered a parallel decline to those of heathland and chalk grassland, but because of the scattered and fragmented distribution of suitable soil conditions it has declined even more than those habitats.  Many examples have disappeared due to agricultural improvement, or to a lack of grazing management, which leads to replacement by species-poor scrub and woodland.  Chalk heath is especially sensitive to soil disturbance such as [[plough]]ing, which mixes the thin layer of acidic soil with the chalk beneath.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5904">In [[geomorphology]], '''cryoplanation''' or '''altiplanation''' is a term used to both describe and explain the formation of [[planation surface|plains]], terraces and [[pediment (geology)|pediment]]s in [[periglaciation|periglacial environments]].&lt;ref name=Thorn&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Thorn|first=Colin E.|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|editor-link=|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|title=Cryoplanation|year=2004|pages=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uncertainty surrounds the term,&lt;ref name=Thorn/&gt; and the effectiveness of the cryoplanation process is held to be limited meaning it can only produce small terraces.&lt;ref name=Migon/&gt; Instead, many of so-called cryoplanation terraces are likely an expression of the underlying [[lithology]] and [[structural geology|rock structure]] rather than being unique products of cold-climate processes.&lt;ref name=French2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grabetal2005/&gt;

Cryoplanation can be seen as a variant of [[pediplain|pediplanation]] that is restricted to cold climates.&lt;ref name=Migon&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Migoń|first=Piotr|author-link=Piotr Migoń|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|editor-link=|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|title=Planation surface|year=2004|pages=788–792}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the cryoplanation surfaces that exists at present date to the [[Quaternary]].&lt;ref name=Migon/&gt;  

==History of the concept==
The existence of flat bedrock surfaces in the mountains of Siberia was noted in the 1930s. [[Science and technology in the Soviet Union|Soviet scientist]]s S.G. Boch and I.I. Krasnov first proposed a cyclical model for the formation these surfaces in 1943. This model influenced central and western European geomorphologists.&lt;ref name=French2007&gt;{{cite book|first=Hugh M.|last=French|title=The Periglacial Environment|edition=3rd|date=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.|isbn=978-0-470-86588-0|pages=244–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Troll]], writing in German, called these surfaces “solifluktions-rumpf”, and [[Jean Tricart]], writing in French called them “penéplaine périglaciaire”.&lt;ref name=Weischet/&gt; In 1946 [[Kirk Bryan (geologist)|Kirk Bryan]] coined the English term “cryoplanation”.&lt;ref name=Weischet&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Weischet|author-first=Wolfgang|author-last2=|author-first2= |author-last3=|author-first3= |date=1966 |chapter=Solifluxión Periglaciar en el Sur de Chile|title=Estudios Geográficos: Homenaje a D. Humberto Fuenzalida V. |volume=|issue=|pages=211–223|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hall"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=Kevin|author2=Marie-Françoise André|title=Some further observations regarding ‘‘cryoplanation terraces’’ on Alexander Island.|journal=Antarctic Science|year=2010|volume=22|issue=2|pages=175–183|doi=10.1017/s0954102009990617}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 1970s onwards these surfaces are seldom mentioned in Russian scientific literature.&lt;ref name=French2007/&gt; 

Terraces formed by cryoplanation are called ''cryoplanation terraces''. Czudek described cryoplanation terraces as ''gently inclined or nearly horizontal bedrock-cut benches on slopes, spurs and on broad interfluves'' that are formed by the ''parallel retreat of steeper slope segments under periglacial conditions''.&lt;ref name="Czudek"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Czudek|first=Tadeáš|title=Cryoplanation Terraces: A Brief Review and Some Remarks.|journal=[[Geografiska Annaler]]. Series A, Physical Geography.|year=1995|volume=77|issue=1/2|pages=95–105|doi=10.2307/521280}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, with the effect of cryoplanation on the landscape, the [[vegetation]] on these frost-altered terraces is also reshaped. The vegetation tends to be uniquely uniform both laterally and vertically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raup|first=Hugh M.|title=Vegetation and Cryoplanation.|journal=Ohio Journal of Science|year=1951|volume=51|issue=3|pages=105–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this unique freeze-thaw cycle are customarily found in [[Arctic]] [[periglacial]] regions of [[Eastern Siberia]] and [[Alaska]]. They may also be found in areas that currently or have sometime in the past experienced intense seasonal freezing or [[permafrost]].&lt;ref name="Czudek"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1950 Peltier proposed the existence of a "[[periglaciation|periglacial]] [[cycle of erosion]]". This would begin with a non-periglaciated landscape. Once-periglaciated mass wasting of [[regolith]] exposes bedrock in the upper slopes. These outcrops are then subject to [[frost weathering]] that makes slopes retreat forming extensive [[blockfield]]s at the base of the bedrock areas. At a later stage [[solifluction]] wears down summits and fills in topographic lows.&lt;ref name=French2007/&gt;

==Assessment== 
The concept has been questioned. According to geomorpholigists Kevin Hall and Marie-Françoise André the theory has caused confusion because of “the almost complete absence of actual data from active cryoplanation terraces”.&lt;ref name="hall"/&gt; It is considered unlikely that cryoplanation can produce any large surfaces. Cryoplanation can be defined as a variant of [[pediplain|pediplanation]] that is restricted to cold climates.&lt;ref name=Migon/&gt; Some terraces developed on [[Karoo-Ferrar|flood basalt]] in eastern [[Lesotho Highlands]], Southern Africa, have been suggested to fit most of the criteria to be cryoplanation terraces except they are more the result of [[structural geology|rock structure]] than of planation.&lt;ref name=Grabetal2005&gt;{{cite journal|author-last=Grab|author-first=Stefan|author-last2=van Zyl|author-first2=Craig |author-last3=Mulder|author-first3=Nicholas |date=2005|title=Controls on basalt terrace formation in the eastern Lesotho highlands|journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |volume=67|issue= |pages=473–485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DART'''  ('''Discrete anisotropic radiative transfer''') is a 3D [[radiative transfer]] [[3D modelling|model]], designed for scientific research, in particular [[remote sensing]]. Developed at CESBIO since 1992, DART model was patented in 2003. It is freeware for scientific activities.

== General Description ==
DART model simulates, simultaneously in several wavelengths of the optical domain (e.g., visible and thermal infrared), the radiative budget and remotely sensed images of any Earth scene (natural / urban with /without relief), for any sun direction, any atmosphere, any view direction and any sensor FTM. It was designed to be precise, easy to use and adapted for operational use. For that, it simulates:  
*Terrestrial landscape.
*The atmosphere (optional simulation).
*The space or airborne radiometric sensor (optional simulation).

It simulates any landscape as a 3D matrice of cells that contain turbid material and triangles. Turbid material is used for simulating vegetation (e.g., tree crowns, grass, agricultural crops,…) and the atmosphere. Triangles are used for simulating translucent and opaque surfaces that makes up topography, urban elements and 3D vegetation. DART can use structural and spectral data bases (atmosphere, vegetation, soil,…). It includes a [[LIDAR]] simulation mode.

=== General Information On Radiative Transfer ===
The approaches used to simulate radiative transfer differ on 2 levels: mathematical method of resolution and mode of representation of the propagation medium. These two levels are in general dependent. The models of radiative transfer are often divided into 2 categories associated with the 2 principal modes of representation of the landscape: homogeneous or heterogeneous representation. For the models known as homogeneous (Idso and of Wit, 1970; Ross, 1981; Verhoef, 1984; Myneni et al., 1989), the landscape is represented by a constant horizontal distribution of absorbing and scattering elements (sheets, branches, etc...). On the other hand, for the  models known as heterogeneous, the landscape is represented by a no uniform space distribution of unspecified elements of the landscape (North, 1996; Govaerts, 1998).

=== Simulation of the "Earth - Atmosphere" scene ===
DART simulates radiative transfer in the "Earth-Atmosphere" system, for any wavelength in the optical domain (shortwaves : visible, thermal infrared,…). Its approach combines the [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] and the discrete ordinate methods. It works with natural and urban landscapes (forests with different types of trees, buildings, rivers,…), with topography and atmosphere above and within the landscape. It simulates light propagation from solar irradiance (Top of Atmosphere) and/or thermal emission within the scene.

== Context [http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/us/dart/dart_contexte.html] ==
The study of the functioning of Continental surfaces requires the understanding of the various energetic and physiologic mechanisms that influence these surfaces. For example, the radiation absorbed in the visible spectral domain is the major energy source for vegetation photosynthesis. Moreover, energy and mass fluxes at the "Earth - Atmosphere" interface affect surface functioning, and consequently climatology.

In this context, Earth observation from space (i.e., space remote sensing) is an indispensable tool, due to its unique potential to provide synoptic and continuous surveys of the Earth, at different time and space scales.

The difficulty in studying continental surfaces arises from the complexity of the energetic and physiologic processes involved and also from the different time and space scales concerned. It comes also from the complexity of satellite remote sensing space and from its links to quantities that characterize Earth functioning. These remarks underline the need of models, because only these can couple and gather within a single scheme all concerned processes.

'''Environmentalism''' or '''environmental rights''' is a broad [[Philosophy of life|philosophy]], [[ideology]], and [[social movement]] regarding concerns for [[environmental protection]] and improvement of the health of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], particularly as the measure for this health seeks to incorporate the impact of changes to the environment on humans, animals, plants and non-living matter. While environmentalism focuses more on the environmental and nature-related aspects of [[Green politics|green ideology and politics]], [[ecologism]] combines the ideology of [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]] and environmentalism. Ecologism is more commonly used in continental European languages while ‘environmentalism’ is more commonly used in English but the words have slightly different connotations.

Environmentalism advocates the preservation, restoration and/or improvement of the natural environment, and may be referred to as a movement to control [[pollution]] or protect plant and animal diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environmentalism |title=Environmentalism - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, concepts such as a [[land ethic]], [[environmental ethics]], [[biodiversity]], [[ecology]], and the [[biophilia hypothesis]] figure predominantly.

At its crux, environmentalism is an attempt to balance relations between humans and the various natural systems on which they depend in such a way that all the components are accorded a proper degree of [[sustainability]]. The exact measures and outcomes of this balance is controversial and there are many different ways for environmental concerns to be expressed in practice. Environmentalism and environmental concerns are often represented by the color [[Green#In culture|green]],&lt;ref name="Light, Dark and Bright Green Environmentalism"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greendaily.com/2009/04/23/light-dark-and-bright-green-environmentalism/ |title=Light, Dark and Bright Green Environmentalism |accessdate=2009-11-02 |author=Cat Lincoln |date=Spring 2009 |publisher=Green Daily |archivedate=25 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425173005/http://www.greendaily.com/2009/04/23/light-dark-and-bright-green-environmentalism/}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this association has been appropriated by the marketing industries for the tactic known as [[greenwashing]].

Environmentalism is opposed by [[anti-environmentalism]], which says that the Earth is less fragile than some environmentalists maintain, and portrays environmentalism as overreacting to the human contribution to [[climate change]] or opposing human advancement.&lt;ref name=rowell&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowell|first=Andrew|title=Green Backlash|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415128285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
''Environmentalism'' denotes a [[environmental movement|social movement]] that seeks to influence the political process by lobbying, activism, and education in order to protect natural resources and [[ecosystem]]s.

An ''[[environmentalist]]'' is a person who may speak out about our natural environment and the sustainable management of its resources through changes in public policy or individual behavior. This may include supporting practices such as informed consumption, conservation initiatives, investment in [[renewable resources]], improved efficiencies in the materials economy, transitioning to new accounting paradigms such as [[Ecological economics]], renewing and revitalizing our connections with non-human life or even opting to have one less child to reduce consumption and pressure on resources.

In various ways (for example, grassroots activism and protests), environmentalists and [[environmental organization]]s seek to give the natural world a stronger voice in human affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gottlieb, ''Forcing the Spring: The Transformation of the American Environmental Movement'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In general terms, environmentalists advocate the [[sustainability|sustainable]] management of resources, and the protection (and restoration, when necessary) of the [[natural environment]] through changes in public policy and individual behavior. In its recognition of humanity as a participant in ecosystems, the movement is centered around [[ecology]], [[health]], and [[human rights]].

A concern for environmental protection has recurred in diverse forms, in different parts of the world, throughout history. 
The earliest ideas of environment protectionism can be traced in [[Jainism]], which was revived by [[Mahavira]] in 6th century BC in ancient [[India]]. Jainism offers a view that may seem readily compatible with core values associated with environmental activism, i.e., protection of life by [[nonviolence]]; which could form the basis of strong ecological ethos thus adding its voice to global calls for protection of environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ajAEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT160&amp;dq=jainism+and+environmentalism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiX9Y7Xva_dAhXFrY8KHYaHAMgQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=jainism+and+environmentalism&amp;f=false|title=Jainism: An Introduction|first=Jeffery D.|last=Long|date=22 March 2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fore.yale.edu/publications/books/cswr/jainism-introduction/|title=Jainism Introduction - Religions of the World and Ecology Book Series - Books - Publications - Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology|website=fore.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Europe]], [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] of England banned the burning of [[coal|sea-coal]] by proclamation in [[London]] in 1272, after its smoke had become a problem.&lt;ref name="Pea-souper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/perspect/london.htm |title=London's Historic 'Pea-Soupers' |accessdate=2006-08-02 |author=David Urbinato |date=Summer 1994 |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002080012/http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/perspect/london.htm |archivedate=2 October 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deadly"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/now/science/smog.html |title=Deadly Smog |accessdate=2006-08-02 |date=2003-01-17 |publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fuel was so common in England that this earliest of names for it was acquired because it could be carted away from some shores by the wheelbarrow.

Earlier in the [[Middle East]], the [[Caliph]] [[Abu Bakr]] in the 630s commanded his army to "Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire," and "Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food."&lt;ref name=Zuhur&gt;{{citation |last1=Aboul-Enein |first1=H.

===Early environmental legislation===
[[File:StRolloxChemical 1831.jpg|thumb|Levels of air pollution rose during the [[Industrial Revolution]], sparking the first modern environmental laws to be passed in the mid-19th century.]]
{{quote|
At the advent of steam and electricity the muse of history holds her nose and shuts her eyes ([[H. G. Wells]] 1918).&lt;ref&gt;[[In the Fourth Year|In the Fourth Year: Anticipations of a World Peace]], (London: Chatto &amp; Windus), p 100.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The origins of the environmental movement lay in the response to increasing levels of [[smoke]] [[pollution]] in the [[atmosphere]] during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in [[history of coal mining|coal consumption]] gave rise to an unprecedented level of [[air pollution]] in industrial centers; after 1900 the large volume of industrial [[chemical]] discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste.&lt;ref name="Donora"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ametsoc.org/sloan/cleanair/ |title=History of the Clean Air Act |accessdate=2006-02-14 |first=James R. |last=Fleming |author2=Bethany R. Knorr |publisher=American Meteorological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first large-scale, modern environmental laws came in the form of Britain's [[Alkali Acts]], passed in 1863, to regulate the deleterious air pollution ([[gaseous]] [[hydrochloric acid]]) given off by the [[Leblanc process]], used to produce [[soda ash]]. An Alkali inspector and four sub-inspectors were appointed to curb this pollution. The responsibilities of the inspectorate were gradually expanded, culminating in the Alkali Order 1958 which placed all major heavy industries that emitted [[smoke]], grit, dust and fumes under supervision.

In industrial cities local experts and reformers, especially after 1890, took the lead in identifying environmental degradation and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Harold L. Platt, ''Shock cities: the environmental transformation and reform of Manchester and Chicago'' (2005) [https://www.amazon.com/Shock-Cities-Environmental-Transformation-Manchester/dp/0226670767/  excerpt].&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution. The [[Environmental Protection UK|Coal Smoke Abatement Society]] was formed in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir [[William Blake Richmond]], frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke. It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke. The provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the Smoke Abatement Act to include other emissions, such as soot, ash and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations.

During the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]], anarchist controlled territories undertook several environmental reforms which were possibly the largest in the world at the time. [[Daniel Guérin|Daniel Guerin]] notes that [[List of anarchist communities|anarchist territories]] would diversify crops, extend [[irrigation]], initiate [[reforestation]], start tree nurseries and helped establish [[nudist]] colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchism: From Theory to Practice|last=Guerin|first=Daniel|publisher=Monthly Review Press|year=1970|isbn=|location=New York|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once there was a link discovered between air pollution and tuberculosis, the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] shut down several metal factories.&lt;ref&gt;Iain McKay, “Objectivity and Right-Libertarian Scholarship,” 20 January 2009, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://anarchism.pageabode.com/anarcho/caplan.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was, however, only under the impetus of the [[Great Smog]] of 1952 in London, which almost brought the city to a standstill and may have caused upward of 6,000 deaths that the [[Clean Air Act 1956]] was passed and airborne pollution in the city was first tackled. Financial incentives were offered to householders to replace open coal fires with alternatives (such as installing gas fires), or for those who preferred, to burn coke instead (a byproduct of town gas production) which produces minimal smoke. 'Smoke control areas' were introduced in some towns and cities where only smokeless fuels could be burnt and power stations were relocated away from cities. The act formed an important impetus to modern environmentalism, and caused a rethinking of the dangers of environmental degradation to people's quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://activehistory.ca/2012/12/londons-great-smog-60-years-on/|title=London’s Great Smog, 60 Years On|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late 19th century also saw the passage of the first wildlife conservation laws.
The zoologist [[Alfred Newton]] published a series of investigations into the ''Desirability of establishing a 'Close-time' for the preservation of indigenous animals'' between 1872 and 1903. His advocacy for legislation to protect animals from hunting during the mating season led to the formation of the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] and influenced the passage of the [[Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869|Sea Birds Preservation Act]] in 1869 as the first nature protection law in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3540740023|title=Coastal Dunes: Ecology and Conservation|author=G.

===First environmental movements===
Early interest in the environment was a feature of the [[Romantic movement]] in the early 19th century. The poet [[William Wordsworth]] travelled extensively in the [[Lake District]] and wrote that it is a "sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eh-resources.org/timeline/timeline_conservation.html |title=Nature conservation in Britain, ca. 1870-1945 |accessdate=2012-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122133729/http://www.eh-resources.org/timeline/timeline_conservation.html |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Ruskin - Portrait - Project Gutenberg eText 17774.jpg|thumb|[[John Ruskin]] an influential thinker who articulated the Romantic ideal of environmental protection and conservation.]]
Systematic efforts on behalf of the environment only began in the late 19th century; it grew out of the amenity movement in Britain in the 1870s, which was a reaction to [[industrialization]], the growth of cities, and worsening air and [[water pollution]]. Starting with the formation of the [[Commons Preservation Society]] in 1865, the movement championed rural preservation against the encroachments of industrialisation. [[Robert Hunter (National Trust)|Robert Hunter]], solicitor for the society, worked with [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], [[Octavia Hill]], and [[John Ruskin]] to lead a successful campaign to prevent the construction of railways to carry slate from the quarries, which would have ruined the unspoilt valleys of [[Newlands Valley|Newlands]] and [[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]]. This success led to the formation of the Lake District Defence Society (later to become The Friends of the Lake District).&lt;ref name=vc&gt;[http://www.visitcumbria.com/rawnsley.htm "Canon Hardwicke Drummond Rawnsley"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806070246/http://www.visitcumbria.com/rawnsley.htm |date=6 August 2014 }}, Visitcumbria.com, accessed 17 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Kropotkin]] wrote about ecology in [[economics]], [[agricultural science]], [[Conservation movement|conservation]], [[ethology]], criminology, urban planning, geography, geology and biology. He observed in Swiss and Siberian glaciers that they had been slowly melting since the dawn of the industrial revolution, possibly making him one of the first predictors for climate change. He also observed the damage done from deforestation and hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zabalazabooks.net/2013/12/04/green-flame-kropotkin-and-the-birth-of-ecology/|title=Green Flame: Kropotkin and the Birth of Ecology|last=Purchase|first=Graham|date=4 December 2013|website=zabalazabooks.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kropotkin's writings would become influential in the 1970s and became a major inspiration for the [[intentional community]] movement as well as his ideas becoming the basis for the theory of [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]].

In 1893 Hill, Hunter and Rawnsley agreed to set up a national body to coordinate environmental conservation efforts across the country; the "National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty" was formally inaugurated in 1894.&lt;ref name=t94&gt;"A Proposed National Trust", ''The Times'', 17 July 1894, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation obtained secure footing through the 1907 National Trust Bill, which gave the trust the status of a statutory corporation.&lt;ref&gt;"Parliamentary Committees", ''The Times'', 26 July 1907. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and the bill was passed in August 1907.&lt;ref name=act&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/servlet/file/store5/item740098/version1/National%20Trust%20Acts%201907-1971%20post%20Order%202005.pdf "An Act to incorporate and confer powers upon the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602185018/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/servlet/file/store5/item740098/version1/National%20Trust%20Acts%201907-1971%20post%20Order%202005.pdf |date=2 June 2012 }}, The National Trust, accessed 4 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

An early "Back-to-Nature" movement, which anticipated the romantic ideal of modern environmentalism, was advocated by intellectuals such as [[John Ruskin]], [[William Morris]], [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Edward Carpenter]], who were all against [[consumerism]], [[pollution]] and other activities that were harmful to the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Peter C. (1988). ''Early Green Politics'', Brighton, Harvester Press, pgs. 15-19, and [[Derek Wall|Wall, Derek]], (1994) ''Green History: A Reader.'' London, Routledge, pgs. 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was a reaction to the urban conditions of the industrial towns, where sanitation was awful, pollution levels intolerable and housing terribly cramped. Idealists championed the rural life as a mythical [[Utopia]] and advocated a return to it. John Ruskin argued that people should return to a ''small piece of English ground, beautiful, peaceful, and fruitful. We will have no steam engines upon it . . . we will have plenty of flowers and vegetables . . . we will have some music and poetry; the children will learn to dance to it and sing it.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Back_to_the_Land.html?id=JcvZAAAAMAAJ|title=Back to the Land: The Pastoral Impulse in England, 1880-1914|author=Jan Marsh|year=1982|publisher=Quartet Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical ventures in the establishment of small cooperative farms were even attempted and old rural traditions, without the "taint of manufacture or the canker of artificiality", were enthusiastically revived, including the [[Morris dance]] and the [[maypole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1983/1215/121523.html|title='Back to nature' movement nothing new - dates back to 1880|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas also inspired various environmental groups in the UK, such as the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]], established in 1889 by [[Emily Williamson]] as a [[advocacy group|protest group]] to campaign for greater protection for the indigenous birds of the [[British Isles|island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/milestones.asp|title=Milestones|publisher=''RSPB''|accessdate=19 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/index.asp |title=History of the RSPB |publisher=''RSPB''|accessdate=19 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society attracted growing support from the suburban middle-classes as well as support from many other influential figures, such as the [[ornithologist]] Professor [[Alfred Newton]]. By 1900, public support for the organisation had grown, and it had over 25,000 members. The [[Garden city movement]] incorporated many environmental concerns into its [[urban planning]] manifesto; the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] and [[The Clarion]] movement also began to advocate measures of [[nature conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;Gould,(1988) pgs. 16, 23-4,36-8,84-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Walden Thoreau.jpg|thumb|left|Original title page of ''[[Walden]]'' by [[Henry David Thoreau]].]]
[[Environmental movement in the United States|The movement in the United States]] began in the late 19th century, out of concerns for protecting the natural resources of the West, with individuals such as [[John Muir]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] making key philosophical contributions. Thoreau was interested in peoples' relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life. He published his experiences in the book ''[[Walden]]'', which argues that people should become intimately close with nature. Muir came to believe in nature's inherent right, especially after spending time hiking in [[Yosemite Valley]] and studying both the ecology and geology. He successfully lobbied congress to form [[Yosemite National Park]] and went on to set up the [[Sierra Club]] in 1892. The conservationist principles as well as the belief in an inherent right of nature were to become the bedrock of modern environmentalism.

In the 20th century, environmental ideas continued to grow in popularity and recognition. Efforts were starting to be made to save some wildlife, particularly the [[American bison]]. The death of the last [[passenger pigeon]] as well as the endangerment of the American bison helped to focus the minds of conservationists and popularize their concerns. In 1916 the [[National Park Service]] was founded by US President [[Woodrow Wilson]].

The [[Forestry Commission]] was set up in 1919 in Britain to increase the amount of woodland in Britain by buying land for [[afforestation]] and [[reforestation]]. The commission was also tasked with promoting forestry and the production of timber for trade.&lt;ref name=woodland&gt;{{cite journal|title=Forestry Commission – a brief history|publisher=Woodland Trust|url=http://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/en/campaigning/save-ancient-forests/Documents/a-brief-history-of-the-fc.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s the Commission focused on acquiring land to begin planting out new forests; much of the land was previously used for agricultural purposes. By 1939 the Forestry Commission was the largest landowner in Britain.&lt;ref name=ForestPoliciesBook&gt;{{cite book|title=Forest Policies and Social Change in England|author=Sylvie Nail|date=July 2008|page=332|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781402083648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the ''Dauerwald'' (best translated as the "perpetual forest") which included concepts such as [[forest management]] and protection was promoted and efforts were also made to curb [[air pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/technology_and_culture/v048/48.1olsen.html JONATHAN OLSEN "How Green Were the Nazis?

In 1949, ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' by [[Aldo Leopold]] was published. It explained Leopold's belief that humankind should have moral respect for the environment and that it is unethical to harm it. The book is sometimes called the most influential book on conservation.

Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and beyond, photography was used to enhance public awareness of the need for protecting land and recruiting members to environmental organizations. [[David Brower]], [[Ansel Adams]] and [[Nancy Newhall]] created the Sierra Club Exhibit Format Series, which helped raise public environmental awareness and brought a rapidly increasing flood of new members to the Sierra Club and to the environmental movement in general. "This Is Dinosaur" edited by [[Wallace Stegner]] with photographs by [[Martin Litton (environmentalist)|Martin Litton]] and [[Philip Hyde (photographer)|Philip Hyde]] prevented the building of dams within [[Dinosaur National Monument]] by becoming part of a new kind of activism called environmentalism that combined the conservationist ideals of Thoreau, Leopold and Muir with hard-hitting advertising, lobbying, book distribution, letter writing campaigns, and more. The powerful use of photography in addition to the written word for conservation dated back to the creation of [[Yosemite National Park]], when photographs persuaded Abraham Lincoln to preserve the beautiful glacier carved landscape for all time. The Sierra Club Exhibit Format Series galvanized public opposition to building dams in the [[Grand Canyon]] and protected many other national treasures. The Sierra Club often led a coalition of many environmental groups including the [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|Wilderness Society]] and many others. After a focus on preserving wilderness in the 1950s and 1960s, the Sierra Club and other groups broadened their focus to include such issues as air and water pollution, population concern, and curbing the exploitation of natural resources.

===Post-war expansion===
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Post-war economic expansion and emerging ecological concerns }}
In 1962, ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by American biologist [[Rachel Carson]] was published. The book cataloged the environmental impacts of the indiscriminate spraying of [[DDT]] in the US and questioned the logic of releasing large amounts of chemicals into the environment without fully understanding their effects on human health and ecology. The book suggested that DDT and other pesticides may cause [[cancer]] and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife, particularly birds.&lt;ref name="Silent Spring"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Silent Spring]] |first=Rachel |last=Carson |authorlink=Rachel Carson |year=1962 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |location=[[Boston]] |isbn=0-8093-2218-8}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting public concern led to the creation of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1970 which subsequently banned the agricultural use of DDT in the US in 1972. The limited use of DDT in [[Vector (epidemiology)|disease vector]] control continues to this day in certain parts of the world and remains controversial. The book's legacy was to produce a far greater awareness of environmental issues and interest into how people affect the environment. With this new interest in environment came interest in problems such as air pollution and petroleum spills, and environmental interest grew. New pressure groups formed, notably [[Greenpeace]] and [[Friends of the Earth (US)]], as well as notable local organizations such as the [[Wyoming Outdoor Council]], which was founded in 1967.

In the 1970s, the environmental movement gained rapid speed around the world as a productive outgrowth of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/11/opinion/in-praise-of-the-counterculture.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's first political parties to campaign on a predominantly environmental platform were the [[United Tasmania Group]] [[Tasmania|Tasmania, Australia]] and the [[Values Party]] of [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="Dann, Christine"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dann|first=Christine|title=The development of the first two Green parties New Zealand and Tasmania|url=http://www.globalgreens.org/literature/dann/chapterfive.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515170932/http://www.globalgreens.org/literature/dann/chapterfive.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 May 2011|work=From Earth's last islands.

The first national green party in Europe was PEOPLE, founded in Britain in February 1973, which eventually turned into the [[Ecology Party]], and then the [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]].

Protection of the environment also became important in the [[developing world]]; the [[Chipko movement]] was formed in India under the influence of [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]] and they set up peaceful resistance to [[deforestation]] by literally hugging trees (leading to the term "tree huggers"). Their peaceful methods of protest and slogan "ecology is permanent economy" were very influential.

Another milestone in the movement was the creation of [[Earth Day]]. Earth Day was first observed in [[San Francisco]] and other cities on March 21, 1970, the first day of spring. It was created to give awareness to environmental issues. On March 21, 1971, United Nations Secretary-General U Thant spoke of a [[spaceship Earth]] on Earth Day, hereby referring to the [[ecosystem services]] the earth supplies to us, and hence our obligation to protect it (and with it, ourselves). Earth Day is now coordinated globally by the [[Earth Day Network]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthday.net/ |title=Resource temporarily unavailable |publisher=Earthday.net |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is celebrated in more than 175 countries every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/environmentalchemistry/f/earthday.htm |title=What Is Earth Day? |publisher=Chemistry.about.com |date=2012-04-15 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN's first major conference on international environmental issues, the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (also known as the Stockholm Conference), was held on June 5–16, 1972. It marked a turning point in the development of international environmental politics.&lt;ref name="Baylis3"&gt;John Baylis, Steve Smith. 2005. The Globalization of World Politics (3rd ed). Oxford. Oxford University Press. P.454-455&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1970s, many felt that people were on the edge of environmental catastrophe. The [[Back-to-the-land movement]] started to form and ideas of environmental ethics joined with [[anti-Vietnam War]] sentiments and other political issues. These individuals lived outside normal society and started to take on some of the more radical environmental theories such as [[deep ecology]]. Around this time more mainstream environmentalism was starting to show force with the signing of the [[Endangered Species Act]] in 1973 and the formation of [[CITES]] in 1975. Significant amendments were also enacted to the United States [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]&lt;ref&gt;Clean Air Act Extension of 1970, {{usstat|84|1676}}, {{uspl|91|604}}, 1970-12-31.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glin.gov/download.action?fulltextId=68261&amp;documentId=70515&amp;glinID=70515 Pub.L. 95-217] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229205148/http://www.glin.gov/download.action?fulltextId=68261&amp;documentId=70515&amp;glinID=70515 |date=29 February 2012 }}, December 27, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, [[James Lovelock]], a British scientist, published ''Gaia: A new look at life on Earth'', which put forth the [[Gaia hypothesis]]; it proposes that life on [[earth]] can be understood as a single organism. This became an important part of the [[Deep Green Resistance|Deep Green]] ideology. Throughout the rest of the history of environmentalism there has been debate and argument between more radical followers of this Deep Green ideology and more mainstream environmentalists.

===21st century and beyond===
Environmentalism continues to evolve to face up to new issues such as [[global warming]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and [[genetic engineering]].

Research demonstrates a precipitous decline in the US public's interest in 19 different areas of environmental concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McCallum, M.L.|author2=G.W. Bury|last-author-amp=yes|year=2013|title=Google search patterns suggest declining interest in the environment|journal=Biodiversity and Conservation|doi=10.1007/s10531-013-0476-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10531-013-0476-6|volume=22|issue=6|pages=1355–1367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Americans are less likely be actively participating in an environmental movement or organization and more likely to identify as "unsympathetic" to an environmental movement than in 2000.&lt;ref name="gallup.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/1615/environment.aspx |title=Environment &amp;#124; Gallup Historical Trends |publisher=Gallup.com |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely a lingering factor of the [[Great Recession]] in 2008. Since 2005, the percentage of Americans agreeing that the environment should be given priority over economic growth has dropped 10 points, in contrast, those feeling that growth should be given priority "even if the environment suffers to some extent" has risen 12 percent.&lt;ref name="gallup.com"/&gt; These numbers point to the growing complexity of environmentalism and its relationship to economics.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== New forms of ecoactivism ===
[[Tree sitting]] is a form of activism in which the protester sits in a tree in an attempt to stop the removal of a tree or to impede the demolition of an area with the longest and most famous tree-sitter being [[Julia Butterfly Hill]], who spent 738 days in a California Redwood, saving a three-acre tract of forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/18/weekinreview/18basic.html|title=Rising Above the Environmental Debate|last=Fountain|first=Henry|date=18 June 2006|work=New York Times|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sit-in]] is a form of activism where one or any number of people occupy a place as a form of protest.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The tactic can be used to encourage social change, such as the Greensboro sit-ins, a series of protests in 1960 to stop racial segregation, but can also be used in ecoactivism, as in the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]] Protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/us/veterans-to-serve-as-human-shields-for-pipeline-protesters.html?_r=0|title=New York Times|last=Mele|first=Christopher|date=2016|work=Veterans To Serve as 'Human Shields' for Dakota Pipeline Protestors|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Syrian Civil War]], [[Rojava]] had been ecologically damaged by [[monoculture]], oil extraction, damming of rivers, [[deforestation]], [[drought]], [[Erosion|topsoil loss]] and general pollution. The [[Democratic Federation of Northern Syria|DFNS]] launched a campaign titled 'Make Rojava Green Again' (a parody of [[Make America Great Again]]) which is attempting to provide [[renewable energy]] to communities (especially [[Solar Energy Generating Systems|solar energy]]), [[reforestation]], protecting water sources, planting gardens, promoting [[urban agriculture]], creating [[Nature reserve|wildlife reserves]], [[Reclaimed water|water recycling]], [[beekeeping]], expanding [[Public Transportation|public transportation]] and promoting environmental awareness within their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicornriot.ninja/2018/building-autonomy-ecology-rojava/|title=Building Autonomy Through Ecology in Rojava|last=|first=|date=28 February 2018|website=unicornriot.ninja|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities]] are firmly environmentalist and have stopped the extraction of oil, uranium, timber and metal from the [[Lacandon Jungle]] and stopped the use of [[pesticide]]s and [[Fertilizer|chemical fertilizers]] in farming.&lt;ref&gt;Gobierno Autónomo I: Cuaderno de texto de primer grado del curso de “La Libertad según l@s Zapatistas”'', 19.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[CIPO-RFM]] has engaged in [[sabotage]] and [[direct action]] against [[wind farm]]s, [[shrimp farms]], [[Eucalyptus|eucalyptus plantations]] and the [[timber industry]]. They have also set up corn and coffee [[worker cooperative]]s and built schools and hospitals to help the local populations. They have also created a network of autonomous community radio stations to educate people about dangers to the environment and inform the surrounding communities about new industrial projects that would destroy more land. In 2001, the CIPO-RFM defeated the construction of a highway that was part of [[Plan Puebla Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teaching Rebellion: Stories from the Grassroots Mobilisation in Oaxaca|last=Denham|first=Diana|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental movement==
{{Main|Environmental movement}}
[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|right|Before [[flue-gas desulfurization]] was installed, the [[air pollution|air-polluting]] emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained excessive amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]].]]

The ''[[environmental movement]]'' (a term that sometimes includes the [[conservation movement|conservation]] and [[Green politics|green]] movements) is a diverse scientific, [[Social movement|social]], and [[political movement]]. Though the movement is represented by a range of organizations, because of the inclusion of environmentalism in the classroom curriculum,&lt;ref name="Craig Kridel"&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; the environmental movement has a younger demographic than is common in other social movements (see [[green seniors]]).

Environmentalism as a movement covers broad areas of institutional oppression, including for example: consumption of ecosystems and natural resources into waste, dumping waste into disadvantaged communities, air pollution, water pollution, weak infrastructure, exposure of organic life to toxins, mono-culture, anti-polythene drive (jhola movement) and various other focuses. Because of these divisions, the environmental movement can be categorized into these primary focuses: [[environmental science]], environmental activism, environmental advocacy, and [[environmental justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/enviro-j/|title=American Environmental Justice Movement - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free market environmentalism===
{{Main|Free-market environmentalism}}

Free market environmentalism is a theory that argues that the [[free market]], [[property rights]], and [[tort]] law provide the best tools to preserve the health and [[sustainability]] of the environment. It considers environmental stewardship to be natural, as well as the expulsion of polluters and other aggressors through individual and [[class action]].

===Evangelical environmentalism===
{{Main|Evangelical environmentalism}}

Evangelical environmentalism is an environmental movement in the United States of America in which some [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] have emphasized [[Bible|biblical]] mandates concerning humanity's role as steward and subsequent responsibility for the caretaking of Creation. While the movement has focused on different environmental issues, it is best known for its focus of addressing climate action from a biblically grounded [[theology|theological]] perspective. This movement is controversial among some non-Christian environmentalists due to its rooting in a specific religion.

===Preservation and conservation===
{{Main|Conservation movement|Conservation in the United States}}

Environmental preservation in the United States and other parts of the world, including Australia, is viewed as the setting aside of natural resources to prevent damage caused by contact with humans or by certain human activities, such as logging, mining, hunting, and fishing, often to replace them with new human activities such as tourism and recreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Organizations and conferences==
{{Main|List of environmental organizations}}
[[File:ReefDoctor work station in Ifaty, Madagascar.jpg|thumb|Reef doctor work station in [[Tsifota|Ifaty]], [[Madagascar]]]]

Environmental organizations can be global, regional, national or local; they can be government-run or private ([[NGO]]). Environmentalist activity exists in almost every country. Moreover, groups dedicated to community development and social justice also focus on environmental concerns.

Some US environmental organizations, among them the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] and the [[Environmental Defense Fund]], specialize in bringing lawsuits (a tactic seen as particularly useful in that country). Other groups, such as the US-based [[National Wildlife Federation]], [[the Nature Conservancy]], and [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]], and global groups like the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and [[Friends of the Earth]], disseminate information, participate in [[Hearing (law)|public hearings]], [[Lobbying|lobby]], [[Demonstration (people)|stage demonstrations]], and may purchase land for [[Nature reserve|preservation]]. Statewide nonprofit organizations such as the [[Wyoming Outdoor Council]] often collaborate with these national organizations and employ similar strategies. Smaller groups, including [[Wildlife Conservation International]], conduct research on [[endangered species]] and [[ecosystems]]. More radical organizations, such as [[Greenpeace]], [[Earth First!]], and the [[Earth Liberation Front]], have more directly opposed actions they regard as environmentally harmful. While Greenpeace is devoted to nonviolent confrontation as a means of bearing witness to environmental wrongs and bringing issues into the public realm for debate, the underground ''Earth Liberation Front'' engages in the clandestine destruction of property, the release of caged or penned animals, and other criminal acts. Such tactics are regarded as unusual within the movement, however.

On an international level, concern for the environment was the subject of a [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in Stockholm in 1972, attended by 114 nations. Out of this meeting developed [[UNEP]] ([[United Nations Environment Programme]]) and the follow-up [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] in 1992. Other international organizations in support of environmental policies development include the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]] (as part of [[NAFTA]]), the [[European Environment Agency]] (EEA), and the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC).

===Assassinations===

==In popular culture==
* The popular media have been used to convey conservation messages in the U.S. For instance, the U.S. Forest Service created [[Smokey the Bear]] in 1944; he appeared in countless posters, radio and television programs, movies, press releases, and other guises to warn about forest fires.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Earnhardt Morrison, ''Guardian of the Forest: A History of Smokey Bear and the Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention Program'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; The comic strip ''[[Mark Trail]]'', by environmentalist [[Ed Dodd]], began in 1946; it still appears weekly in 175 newspapers. Another example is the children's animated show ''[[Captain Planet and the Planeteers]]'', created by [[Ted Turner]] and [[Barbara Pyle]] in 1989 to inform children about environmental issues. The show aired for six seasons and 113 episodes, in 100 countries worldwide from 1990 to 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbarapyle.com/captain/|title=Barbara Pyle, with Ted Turner created the animated action series Captain Planet and the Planeteers.|author=|date=|website=www.barbarapyle.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1974, [[Spokane]], [[State of Washington]], became the smallest city ever to host a [[World's Fair]]. From Saturday, May 4, to Sunday, November 3, 1974, Spokane hosted [[Expo 74]], the first world's fair to focus on the environment. The theme of Expo 74 was "Celebrating Tomorrow's Fresh New Environment."
* [[FernGully: The Last Rainforest]] is an animated motion picture released in 1992, which focuses exclusively on the environment. The movie is based on a book under the same title by Diana Young. In 1998, a sequel, [[FernGully 2: The Magical Rescue]], was introduced.
* [[Miss Earth]] is one of the three largest international beauty pageants. (The other two are [[Miss Universe]] and [[Miss World]].) Of these three, Miss Earth is the only beauty pageant that promotes Environmental Awareness. The reigning titleholders dedicate their year to promote specific projects and often address issues concerning the environment and other global issues through school tours, tree planting activities, street campaigns, coastal clean ups, speaking engagements, shopping mall tours, media guesting, environmental fair, storytelling programs, eco-fashion shows, and other environmental activities. The Miss Earth winner is the spokesperson for the [[Miss Earth Foundation]], the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and other environmental organizations. The Miss Earth Foundation also works with the environmental departments and ministries of participating countries, various private sectors and corporations, as well as [[Greenpeace]] and the [[World Wildlife Foundation]] (WWF).
* Another area of environmentalism is to use [[art]] to raise awareness about misuse of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Washed Up' Art Exhibition Raises Awareness of Plastic Pollution|url=https://www.wilson.edu/washed-art-exhibition-raises-awareness-plastic-pollution-0|publisher=Wilson College|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unmasking Pollution with Climate Art|url=http://newsroom.unfccc.int/climate-action/art4climate-unmasking-pollution-with-climate-art/|website=UN Climate Change: Climate Action|publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cerini|first1=Marianna|title=How limited edition sneakers designed by Kanye West are helping people breathe in China|url=http://www.cnn.com/style/article/sneaker-pollution-mask-designer/index.html|accessdate=2 October 2017|agency=CNN|publisher=CNN|date=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is [[trashion]], using trash to create clothes, jewelry, and other objects for the home. [[Marina DeBris]] is one trashion artist, who focuses on ocean and beach trash to design clothes and for fund raising, education.

==An alternative view==

Many environmentalists believe that human interference with 'nature' should be restricted or minimised as a matter of urgency (for the sake of life, or the planet, or just for the benefit of the human species),&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[environmental skeptics]] and anti-environmentalists do not believe that there is such a need.&lt;ref&gt;Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel. "Globalization and Sustainable Development: False Twins?." New Global Studies 7.3: 23-56.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} One can also regard oneself as an environmentalist and believe that human 'interference' with 'nature' should be ''increased''.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Paul Cummins "An Evolutionary Perspective on the Relationship Between Humans and Their Surroundings: Geoengineering, the Purpose of Life &amp; the Nature of the Universe", Cranmore Publications, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there is a risk that the shift from emotional environmentalism into the technical management of natural resources and hazards could decrease the touch of humans with nature, leading to less concern with environment preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pt.scribd.com/doc/119009229/Environment-Professional-and-the-Touch-with-Nature |title=Vasconcelos, Vitor Vieira "The Environment Professional and the Touch with Nature."

It is however from 1519 that their number increases substantially, but gradually. It was an evolution and a gradual improvement in the design made during the first quarter of the century &amp;ndash; technical improvement which continued until the second half of the century. The Portuguese galleon evolved from the [[Square Rigged Caravel|square rigged caravel]] and was a compromise between the great carrack or nau and the aforementioned square rigged caravel or ''war caravel'' (also called ''caravela de armada'' or Portuguese ''man of war'') that evolved into a new design of ship, but keeping its hull design similar to the galley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvc.instituto-camoes.pt/navegaport/c11.html] Galeão &amp;ndash; ''Navegações Portuguesas'' by Francisco Contente Domingues {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also more maneuverable, more robust and heavily armed.]]

'''Galleons''' were large, multi-decked [[sailing ships]] first used by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] as armed cargo carriers and later adopted by other [[Europe]]an states from the 16th to 18th centuries during the [[age of sail]] and were the principal fleet units drafted for use as warships until the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] of the mid-1600s.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Kris E. Pillaging the Empire: Piracy in the Americas 1500-1750. M. E. Sharpe, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Galleons generally carried three or more masts with a [[lateen]] [[fore-and-aft rig]] on the rear masts, were [[Carvel (boat building)|carvel built]] with a prominent squared off raised stern, and used [[square-rigged]] [[sail plan]]s on their fore-mast and main-masts.

Such ships were the mainstay of maritime commerce into the early 19th century, and were often drafted into use as auxiliary naval war vessels&amp;mdash;indeed, were the mainstay of contending fleets through most of the 150 years of the [[Age of Exploration]]&amp;mdash;before the Anglo-Dutch wars brought purpose-built [[ship-rigged]] [[warship]]s that thereafter dominated war at sea during the remainder of the age of sail.

==Etymology==
The term ''galleon'', "large ship", comes from Spanish (Castilian) ''galeón'', "armed merchant ship", from Old French ''galion'', "little ship" (13c.), from Portuguese ''galeão'', "war ship", from Byzantine Greek ''galea'', "[[galley]]" + augmentative suffix ''-on''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=galleon&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible origin is the Old French word ''galie'', meaning "galley;"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wordreference.com/definition/galleon|title= Collins Concise English Dictionary|author= |work= |accessdate=21 Feb 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; also from Byzantine Greek ''galea.''&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Roger Charles, ''Oared fighting ships: From classical times to the coming of steam.'' London. 1962. p. 37-39&lt;/ref&gt; The ''galea'' was a warship of the [[Byzantine navy]], and its name may be related to the Greek word ''galeos'', "[[dogfish shark]]".&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell &amp; Robert Scott [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dgaleo%2Fs Galeos], ''A Greek-English Lexicon''&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originally given to certain types of war [[galley]]s in the Middle Ages. The ''Annali Genovesi'' mentions galleons of 80, 64 and 60 oars, used for battle and on missions of exploration, in the 12th and 13th centuries. It is very likely that the ''galleons'' and ''galliots'' mentioned in the accounts of the crusades were the same vessels.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In the early 16th century, the Venetian ''galleoni'' was a new class of galley used to hunt down pirates in the Mediterranean.

Later, when the term started to be applied to sail-only vessels, it meant, like the English term "man of war", any large warship that was otherwise no different from the other sailing ships of the time.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==History==
In the middle of the 16th century, a lowering of the [[carrack]]'s [[forecastle]] and elongation of the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] gave the ocean-going galleons an unprecedented level of stability in the water, and reduced wind resistance at the front, leading to a faster, more maneuverable vessel. The galleon differed from the older types primarily by being longer, lower and narrower, with a square tuck [[stern]] instead of a round tuck, and by having a snout or head projecting forward from the bows below the level of the forecastle. In [[Portugal]] at least, Portuguese carracks were usually very large ships for their time (often over 1,000 [[ton]]s), while galleons were mostly under 500 tons, although the [[Manila galleon]]s were to reach up to 2,000 tons. With the introduction of the galleon in [[Portuguese India Armadas]] during the first quarter of the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revistamilitar.pt/artigo.php?art_id=667] Os Navios e as Técnicas Náuticas Atlânticas nos Séculos XV e XVI: Os Pilares da Estratégia 3C &amp;ndash; Rear Admiral Antonio Silva Ribeiro &amp;ndash; ''Revista Militar'' {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvc.instituto-camoes.pt/navegaport/c11.html] Galeão &amp;ndash; ''Navegações Portuguesas'' by Francisco Contente Domingues {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; carracks gradually began to be less armed and became almost exclusively cargo ships (which is why the Portuguese Carracks were pushed to such large sizes), leaving any fighting to be done to the galleons. One of the largest and most famous of Portuguese galleons was the ''[[Botafogo (galleon)|São João Baptista]]'' (nicknamed Botafogo, "spitfire"), a 1,000-ton galleon built in 1534, said to have carried 366 guns.&lt;!--São João Baptista was a carrack in terms of hull design. See the etymology to understand why it was called a "galleon" / The São João Baptista is clearly an "evolution" for the type "Galleon" (from the portuguese Carrack, also from the portuguese Caravela Redonda &amp;ndash; origin of the galleons) and a galleon by some experts, relatively distinct of portuguese Carracks in its forecastle and even (in part) in the hull (even in its legendary spur). But it is true that all the Galleons of the Suez Expedition of 1541 have much more the definitive design of a typical clear Galleon that clearly distinguishes them (lower height of the forecastle and elongation of the Hull and not only) from the Carracks and from the Round Caravels that that accompanied them (drawings of D. João de Castro &amp;ndash; In Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal and in the British Library) The Portuguese galleons appear officially in 1510 (Documented &amp;ndash; transition &amp;ndash; "galleons"), 1516, and definitely from 1519 forward. It is hard to see any difference between the João and the other ships. Even late in the 16th century people would still call a ship a nau or a galleon/ But not mentioned in the Portuguese chronicles or records between the 1490s (or before) and 1510, only gales and galeaças (rare); Naus, Caravelas and Caravelas Redondas, Paraus, Bergantins. Portuguese galleon evolved from Carracks and Round Caravels after that. The Portuguese galleon evolved from these two ships, we know that they evolved in the decades following the 1510s, but because of the rarity of detailed illustrations, we only see the full result, the result of an evolution (the typical galleon, with slight variations from country to country after etc. but unmistakable) in paintings of 1540. But this unmistakable modern Galleons are what these documents, starting in the 1510s, particularly 1519 documented &amp;ndash; this type of ships, (apart from the etymology of the word based on the medieval and earlier boats, galley etc.), but surely evolving from there over the years.

Confusions designations after their appearance in this chronicles (between Galleon and Nau) only in generic chroniclers (in the tecnic matter) and some vox populi, but not in Decades of Asia (and other Chroniclers of seamanship knowledgeable) or the reports of the number and type of vessels in ports, all there is more detailed and technical in the kind of existing ships, the various European or of Oriental origin.--&gt;

Carracks also tended to be lightly armed and used for transporting cargo in all the fleets of other Western European states, while galleons were purpose-built warships, and were stronger, more heavily armed, and also cheaper to build (five galleons could cost around the same as three carracks) and were therefore a much better [[investment]] for use as warships or transports. There are disputes about its origins and development but each Atlantic sea power built types suited to its needs, while constantly learning from their rivals. It was the captains of the Spanish navy, [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]] and [[Álvaro de Bazán]], who designed the definitive long and relatively narrow hulled galleon for Spain in the 1550s.&lt;ref&gt;"The galleon evolved in response to Spain's need for an ocean-crossing cargo ship that could beat off corsairs. Pedro de Menéndez, along with Álvaro de Bazán (hero of Lepanto), is credited with developing the protypes which had the long hull—and sometimes the oars—of a galley married to the poop and prow of a portuguese ''[[carrack|nau]]'' or merchantman. Galeones were classed as 1-, 2- or 3-deckers, and stepped two or more masts rigged with square sails and topsails (except for a lateen sail on the mizzenmast). Capacity ranged up to 900 tons or more. Menéndez's ''San Pelayo'' of 1565 was a 900-ton galleon which was also called a ''nau'' and ''galeaza''. She carried 77 crewmen, 18 gunners, transported 317 soldiers and 26 families, as well as provisions and cargo. Her armament was iron."p.100  ''Menéndez: Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, Captain General of the Ocean Sea'' Albert C. Manucy, published 1992 by Pineapple Press, Inc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Timothy R. (2002).''The Spanish Treasure Fleets.'' Pineapple Press Inc, p. 57. {{ISBN|1-56164-261-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Definitive for the Spanish Navy and the Spanish galleon, despite its importance (and huge historical importance) and its influence in foreign navies and its ships later. The English and French etc. were inspired by the Iberian types, using their spyes to get naval informations, and developed their own design, especially England. And Portugal has been faithful to his own development construction at least until the 1590s or more. (Pimentel Barata, "The Portuguese galleon (1519-1625)".--&gt;

The galleon was powered entirely by wind, using [[sail]]s carried on three or four [[mast (sailing)|mast]]s, with a [[lateen sail]] continuing to be used on the last (usually third and fourth) masts. They were used in both military and trade applications, most famously in the [[Spanish treasure fleet]], and the Manila Galleons. While carracks played the leading role in early global explorations, galleons also played a part in the 16th and 17th centuries. In fact, galleons were so versatile that a single vessel may have been refitted for wartime and peacetime roles several times during its lifespan. The galleon was the prototype of all square-rigged ships with three or more masts for over two and a half centuries, including the later [[full-rigged ship]].

The principal warships of the opposing [[England|English]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] fleets in the 1588 confrontation of the [[Spanish Armada]] were galleons, with the modified English "[[race-built]]" galleons developed by [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] proving decisive, while the capacious Spanish galleons, designed primarily as transports, showed great endurance in the battles and in the great storms on the voyage home; most survived the ordeal.

==Construction==
[[File:Pintle and gudgeon rudder system scheme.svg|thumb|The galleon's pintle and gudgeon [[rudder]]]]

Galleons were constructed from [[oak]] (for the [[keel]]), [[pine]] (for the masts) and various [[hardwood]]s for [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] and [[deck (ship)|decking]]. Hulls were usually [[carvel (boat building)|carvel]]-built. The expenses involved in galleon construction were enormous. Hundreds of expert tradesmen (including [[carpenter]]s, [[pitch-melter]]s, [[blacksmith]]s, [[cooper (profession)|cooper]]s, [[shipwright]]s, etc.) worked day and night for months before a galleon was seaworthy. To cover the expense, galleons were often funded by groups of wealthy businessmen who pooled resources for a new ship. Therefore, most galleons were originally consigned for trade, although those captured by rival states were usually put into military service.

The most common gun used aboard a galleon was the [[demi-culverin]], although gun sizes up to [[demi-cannon]] were possible.

Because of the long periods often spent at sea and poor conditions on board, many of the crew often perished during the voyage; therefore advanced [[rigging]] systems were developed so that the vessel could be sailed home by an active [[sailing crew]] a fraction of the size aboard at departure.

==Distinguishing features==

&lt;!--

---&gt;
Galleons were a class of blue water sailing ship that combined the easy-to-maneuver [[fore-and-aft rig]] of smaller shipping (boats) with the square rig of [[late middle ages]] cargo vessels. The galleons solidified the place of the square-rig and the centrally situated tallest main-masts and the slightly shorter fore-masts of a square-rigged ship characteristic of the 16th-19th centuries, but introduced the use of the lateen rig to sail closer to the wind on a tack than could a square-rigged vessel—an important attribute in restricted waters, but more so over long voyages where holding a few compass points closer to the wind might save hundreds of miles and days or weeks of sailing 'beating into the wind'.
 
The most distinguishing features of the galleon include the long prominent [[Beakhead|beak or beakhead]] followed by a [[mast (sailing)|fore-mast and main-mast]], both noticeably taller than the single or double [[lateen-rigged]] [[mizzen]]masts with their sloped [[lateen-rig]] yards, and below those the square [[quarter gallery]] at the [[stern]]. On average with three masts, in larger galleons, a fourth mast was added, usually another lateen-rigged mizzen, called the [[mast (sailing)|bonaventure mizzen]].

The galleon continued to be used into the 18th century, by which time purpose-built vessels such as the [[fluyt]], the [[brig]] and the [[full rigged ship]], both as a trading vessel and [[ship of the line]], rendered it obsolete for trade and warfare respectively.

==The oldest English drawings==
The oldest known scale drawings in [[Kingdom of England|England]] are in a manuscript called "Fragments of Ancient Shipwrightry" made in about 1586 by [[Mathew Baker]], a [[shipwright|master-shipwright]]. This manuscript, held at the Pepysian Library, Magdalene College, Cambridge, provides an authentic reference for the size and shape of typical English galleons built during this period. Based on these plans, the Science Museum, London has built a 1:48 scale model ship that is an exemplar of galleons of this era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/shiplab/treatisefiles/ttfragments.htm Fragments of Ancient English Shipwrightry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Austria]]''' is a small, predominantly mountainous country in [[Central Europe]], approximately between [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[Hungary]]. It has a total area of 83,879&amp;nbsp;km² (32,385&amp;nbsp;mi²), about twice the size of [[Switzerland]].

The landlocked country shares national borders with Switzerland (a non-[[European Union]] member state, which it borders for 158&amp;nbsp;km, or 98&amp;nbsp;mi) and the principality of [[Liechtenstein]] (also a non-EU member state, of which it borders for 34&amp;nbsp;km or 21&amp;nbsp;mi) to the west, Germany (801&amp;nbsp;km or 497&amp;nbsp;mi) and the [[Czech Republic]] (402&amp;nbsp;km or 249&amp;nbsp;mi) and [[Slovakia]] (105&amp;nbsp;km or 65&amp;nbsp;mi) to the north, Hungary to the east (331&amp;nbsp;km or 205&amp;nbsp;mi), and [[Slovenia]] (299&amp;nbsp;km or 185&amp;nbsp;mi) and Italy (404&amp;nbsp;km or 251&amp;nbsp;mi) to the south (total: 2,534&amp;nbsp;km or 1,574&amp;nbsp;mi).

The westernmost third of the somewhat pear-shaped country consists of a narrow corridor between Germany and Italy that is between 32&amp;nbsp;km (19&amp;nbsp;mi) and 60&amp;nbsp;km (37&amp;nbsp;mi) wide. The rest of Austria lies to the east and has a maximum north–south width of 280&amp;nbsp;km (173&amp;nbsp;mi). The country measures almost 600&amp;nbsp;km (372&amp;nbsp;mi) in length, extending from [[Lake Constance]] (German ''Bodensee'') on the Austrian-Swiss-German border in the west to the [[Neusiedler See]] on the Austrian-Hungarian border in the east. The contrast between these two lakes – one in the Alps and the other a typical [[steppe lake]] on the westernmost fringe of the [[Hungarian Plain]] – illustrates the diversity of Austria's landscape.

Seven of [[States of Austria|Austria's nine provinces]] have long historical traditions predating the establishment of the Republic of Austria in 1918: [[Upper Austria]], [[Lower Austria]], [[Styria]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], and [[Vorarlberg]]. The provinces of [[Burgenland]] and [[Vienna]] were established after [[World War I]]. Most of Burgenland had been part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], but it had a predominantly [[German language|German-speaking]] population and hence became Austrian. Administrative and ideological reasons played a role in the establishment of Vienna as an independent province. Vienna, historically the capital of Lower Austria, was a [[socialism|socialist]] stronghold, whereas Lower Austria was [[Conservatism|conservative]], and both socialists and conservatives wanted to consolidate their influence in their respective provinces. Each province has a provincial capital with the exception of Vienna, which is a province in its own right in addition to being the federal capital. In Vienna, the City Council and the mayor function as a provincial parliament and provincial governor, respectively.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

'''[[Geographic coordinates]]''': {{coord|47|20|N|13|20|E|type:country|name=Austria}}

Austria may be divided into three unequal geographical areas. The largest part of Austria (62%) is occupied by the relatively young mountains of the Alps, but in the east, these give way to a part of the [[Pannonian plain]], and north of the [[Danube River]] lies the [[Bohemian Forest]], an older, but lower, [[granite]] mountain range.

===River Danube===
The [[Danube]] has its source near [[Donaueschingen]] in southwestern Germany and flows through Austria before emptying into the [[Black Sea]]. It is the only major European river that flows eastwards, and its importance as an inland waterway has been enhanced by the completion in 1992 of the [[Rhine-Main-Danube Canal]] in [[Bavaria]], which connects the [[Rhine]] and [[Main (river)|Main]] rivers with the Danube and makes [[barge]] traffic from the [[North Sea]] to the Black Sea possible.

The major rivers north of the watershed of the Austrian Alps (the [[Inn River|Inn]] in Tyrol, the [[Salzach]] in Salzburg, and the [[Enns River|Enns]] in Styria and Upper Austria) are direct tributaries of the Danube and flow north into the Danube valley, whereas the rivers south of the watershed in central and eastern Austria (the [[Gail River|Gail]] and [[Drava|Drau]] rivers in Carinthia and the [[Mürz]] and [[Mur River|Mur]] rivers in Styria) flow south into the drainage system of the Drau, which eventually empties into the Danube in [[Serbia]]. Consequently, central and eastern Austria are geographically oriented away from the watershed of the Alps: the provinces of Upper Austria and Lower Austria toward the Danube and the provinces of Carinthia and Styria toward the Drau.

===The Alps===

Three major ranges of the [[Alps]] – the [[Northern Calcareous Alps]], [[Central Eastern Alps|Central Alps]], and [[Southern Calcareous Alps]] – run west to east through Austria. The Central Alps, which consist largely of a granite base, are the largest and highest ranges in Austria. The Central Alps run from Tyrol to approximately the Styria-Lower Austria border and include areas that are permanently glaciated in the [[Ötztal Alps]] on the Tyrolean&amp;ndash;[[Italy|Italian]] border and the [[High Tauern]] in [[East Tyrol]] and Carinthia. The Northern Calcareous Alps, which run from Vorarlberg through Tyrol into Salzburg along the German border and through Upper Austria and Lower Austria toward Vienna, and the Southern Calcareous Alps, on the Carinthia-Slovenia border, are predominantly [[limestone]] and [[dolomite]]. At 3,797 m, [[Großglockner]] is the highest mountain in Austria. As a general rule, the farther east the Northern and Central Alps run, the lower they become. The altitude of the mountains also drops north and south of the central ranges.

As a geographic feature, the Alps literally overshadow other landform regions. Just over 28% of Austria is moderately hilly or flat: the Northern Alpine Foreland, which includes the Danube Valley; the lowlands and hilly regions in northeastern and eastern Austria, which include the Danube Basin; and the rolling hills and lowlands of the Southeastern Alpine Foreland. The parts of Austria that are most suitable for settlement – that is, arable and climatically favorable – run north of the Alps through the provinces of Upper Austria and Lower Austria in the Danube Valley and then curve east and south of the Alps through Lower Austria, Vienna, Burgenland, and Styria. Austria's least mountainous landscape is southeast of the low [[Leithagebirge]], which forms the southern lip of the [[Viennese Basin]], where the steppe of the Hungarian Plain begins.

===Bohemian Forest (mountain range)===
The [[granite]] massif of the [[Bohemian Forest]] (known in [[German language|German]] as the ''Böhmerwald''), a low mountain range with bare and windswept plateaus and a harsh climate, is located north of the Danube Valley and covers the remaining 10% of Austria's area. Notable is the [[Manhartsberg]] a granite ridge which separates [[Waldviertel]] from [[Weinviertel]].

Land-use patterns in Austria change from Alpine to non-Alpine regions. Approximately one-tenth of Austria is barren or unproductive, that is, extremely Alpine or above the [[tree line]]. Just over 40% of Austria is covered by forests, the majority of which is in Alpine regions. Less than one-fifth of Austria is [[arable land|arable]] and suitable for conventional [[agriculture]]. The percentage of arable land in Austria increases in the East as the country becomes less alpine. More than one-fifth of Austria is pasture and meadow located at varying altitudes. Almost half of this [[grassland]] consists of high Alpine pastures.

Historically, high Alpine pastures have been used during the summer for grazing dairy cattle, thus making space available at lower altitudes for cultivating and harvesting fodder for winter. Many of the high pastures are at altitudes of more than 1,000 m.

Although agriculture in mountainous areas was at one time economically viable, in recent decades it has survived only with the help of extensive subsidies. A concern of farmers in these mountainous regions is that membership of the [[European Union]] might entail a curtailment of these subsidies and the end of Alpine agriculture. If this occurs, many areas will be reclaimed by nature after centuries of cultivation.

Although the Alps are beautiful, they make many areas of Austria uninhabitable. Austria's so-called areas of permanent settlement – regions that are cultivated, continuously inhabited, and used for transportation, but do not include forests, Alpine pastures, or barren land – cover only 40% or 35,000&amp;nbsp;km² of the country. The great majority of the area of permanent settlement is in the Danube valley and the lowlands or hilly regions north, east, and south of the Alps, where approximately two-thirds of the population lives.

In the country's predominantly Alpine provinces, most of the population live in river valleys: Bregenz on the shores of Lake Constance in Vorarlberg; Innsbruck on the Inn River in Tyrol; Salzburg on the Salzach River in Salzburg; and Klagenfurt on the [[Wörthersee]] lake in Carinthia. The higher the Alps are, the less inhabitable they become in terms of soil, microclimate, and vegetation. Conversely, the lower and broader the Alpine valleys are, the more densely populated they become.

Tyrol illustrates most clearly the relationship between Alpine geography and habitation. As the most mountainous province (less than 3% of the land is arable), it is the most sparsely inhabited, with an area of permanent settlement of only 15%.

Because of the Alps, the country as a whole is one of the least densely populated states of Western and Central Europe. With ninety-three inhabitants per square kilometre, Austria has a population density similar to that of the former [[Yugoslavia]].

Austria's national borders and geography have corresponded very little. Since the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], the Alps and the Danube have not served to mark political boundaries. Even within Austria, provincial borders were only occasionally set by the ranges and ridges of the Alps.

Although the Alps did not mark political boundaries, they often separated groups of people from one another. Because in the past the Alps were impassable, inhabitants isolated in valleys or networks of valleys developed distinct regional subcultures. Consequently, the inhabitants of one valley frequently maintained dialects, native or traditional dress, architectural styles, and folklore that substantially differed from those of the next valley. Differences were great enough that the origins of outsiders could easily be identified. However, mass media, mobility, prosperity, and tourism have eroded the distinctness of Alpine regional subcultures to a great extent by reducing the isolation that gave them their particular character.

Despite the Alps, Austria has historically been a land of transit. The Danube valley, for centuries [[Central Europe|Central Europe's]] aquatic link to the [[Balkan Peninsula]] and the "[[Orient]]" in the broadest sense of the word, has always been an avenue of east–west transit. However, Europe's division into two opposing economic and military blocs after [[World War II]] diminished Austria's importance as a place of transit. Since the opening of [[Eastern Europe]] in 1989, the country has begun to re-assume its historical role. By the early 1990s, it had already experienced a substantial increase in the number of people and vehicles crossing its eastern frontiers.

Within the Alps, four passes and the roads that run through them are of particular importance for north–south transit. The [[Semmering Pass]] on the provincial border of Lower Austria and Styria connects the Viennese Basin with the Mürz and Mur valleys, thus providing northeast-southwest access to Styria and Slovenia, and, via Carinthia, to Italy.

The [[Pyrhn Pass]] between the provinces of Upper Austria and Styria and the [[Tauern Pass]] between the [[High Tauern]] range and the [[Lower Tauern]] range of the Central Alps in Salzburg, provide access to the Mur Valley in Styria and the Drau Valley in Carinthia, respectively. The highways that run through these passes are important northwest-southeast lines of communication through the Alps. The Pyrhn highway has been nicknamed the ''Fremdarbeiterweg'' ("foreign workers' route") because millions of ''[[Gastarbeiter]]'' ("guest workers") in Germany use it to return to their homes in the [[Balkans]] and [[Turkey]] for vacation. Many Germans and northern Europeans also use it in the summer months to reach the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic coast]]. After the outbreak of hostilities in Yugoslavia in the summer of 1991, however, a substantial amount of this traffic was re-routed through the Danube Valley and [[Hungary]].

The most important pass in the Austrian Alps is the [[Brenner Pass]], located on the Austrian-Italian border in Tyrol. At 1,370 m, it is one of the lowest Alpine passes. The route up the Inn valley and over the Brenner Pass has been historically an important and convenient route of north–south transit between Germany and Italy, and provides the most direct route between Europe's two most highly industrialized regions: Germany and northern Italy.

==Climate==
[[File:Austria Köppen.svg|thumb|300px|[[Köppen climate classification]] types of Austria]]
[[Image:Alps satellite in winter.jpg|thumb|right|Heralding the oncoming winter, snow dusts the peaks of the Alps on December 11, 2004. North of the Alps, clouds cover France, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, and Slovenia. South of the Alps, clear skies dominate most of the image, leaving the Po River valley and peninsular Italy showing clearly. To the southwest, the Ligurian and Mediterranean Seas are an almost uniform deep blue color; to the southeast, the Adriatic Sea features swirls of blue-green microscopic sea organisms (likely phytoplankton and algae), as well as some green-tan sediment from rivers emptying into the sea.]]

The Alps serve as a [[Water divide|watershed]] for Europe's three major kinds of weather systems that influence Austrian weather. The Atlantic maritime climate from the northwest is characterized by low-pressure fronts, mild air from the [[Gulf Stream]], and precipitation. It has the greatest influence on the northern slopes of the Alps, the Northern Alpine Foreland, and the Danube valley. The continental climate is characterized by low pressure fronts with precipitation in summer and high pressure systems with cold and dry air in winter. It affects mainly eastern Austria. Mediterranean high-pressure systems from the south are characterized by few clouds and warm air, and they influence the weather of the southern slopes of the Alps and that of the Southeastern Alpine Foreland, making them the most temperate part of Austria.

One peculiarity of the Mediterranean weather systems is the [[foehn wind|föhn wind]], a warm air mass that originates in the African [[Sahara]] and moves north rapidly, periodically raising temperatures up to {{convert|10|C-change}} in a short period of time. Many people respond to this rapid weather change with [[headache]]s, [[irritability]], and [[blood circulation|circulatory problems]]. During the winter, the rapid warming that accompanies a föhn can thaw the snow cover in the Alps to such an extent that [[avalanche]]s occur.

Given the importance of Alpine [[skiing]] for the Austrian tourist industry, December is the month during which the weather is watched with the greatest anticipation. As a rule, Atlantic maritime weather systems bring snow, and continental weather systems help keep it. However, a predominance of cold, dry continental systems or warm Mediterranean ones inevitably postpone the beginning of the ski season. In the summer, Mediterranean high-pressure systems bring warm, sunny weather.

==Ecological concerns==
Austrians faced a number of ecological problems in the 1990s. One of the most pressing is the pollution caused by the staggering increase of traffic through the country. Traffic on the superhighway going through the Brenner Pass has, for example, increased from 600,000 vehicles per year in the early 1970s to over 10&amp;nbsp;million per year in the early 1990s. One quarter of the traffic crossing Austria consists of semitrailers used for heavy transport. The opening of Eastern Europe has only exacerbated the problem of transit traffic.

The Alpine valleys through which much of this traffic passes are unusually vulnerable to ecological damage. Narrow valleys are not conducive to dissipation of noise or pollutants caused by motor vehicles. Inversions – cold layers of air that trap warm layers of air or warm layers of air that trap cold layers in the valleys and lowlands – also seasonally contribute to the magnitude of the pollution problem.

Austria has negotiated with the EU to set limits on the amount of commercial transit traffic, especially through Tyrol. Work is also under way to develop a "piggy-back" system of loading semitrailers on to flatbed railroad cars in southern Germany and northern Italy, transporting them through Tyrol by rail. Environmentalists have pushed for measures that are more far-reaching. They advocate, for example, digging a tunnel from [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] in southern Germany to [[Bolzano]] in northern Italy.

Pollution is also brought by the weather systems that determine the country's climate. Atlantic maritime weather systems carry pollution into Austria from northwestern Europe. Austria's proximity to industrialized regions of former Communist states, with negligible or no pollution control policies or equipment, combined with the influence of continental weather systems also have proved to be extremely harmful. Mediterranean weather systems transmit industrial pollutants from northern Italy.

As a result of domestic and foreign pollution, 37% of Austria's forests had been damaged by [[acid rain]] and/or pollutant emissions by 1991. The damage to forests has had dire consequences, including the decimation of forests that for centuries had protected many Alpine communities from avalanches, [[erosion]], [[mudslide]]s, or [[flood]]ing caused by runoff.

The seriousness of the ecological problems confronting the country gave rise in the 1970s to an environmentalist movement. Political parties were formed, and representatives were elected to parliament. A [[referendum]] in 1978 closed down a newly completed [[nuclear power station]] and turned the country away from the exploitation of nuclear energy. Public opposition in 1984 stopped the planned construction of a [[hydroelectric power station]] in a wetlands region.

The country's long-standing commercial use of the Alps for recreational purposes has also come under examination. Extensive tourism places an inordinate amount of pressure on sensitive Alpine ecosystems. Ski runs damage forests, as do summer sports such as off-trail mountain hiking or mountain biking. Many Alpine villages have also grown greatly because of the tourist industry. In extreme cases, they have up to twenty hotel beds for each inhabitant, a ratio that places a disproportionate seasonal burden on communal infrastructures and the environment. For these reasons, efforts have been made to introduce "green" or "soft" forms of tourism that are more compatible with the Alpine environment.

Part of the solution to Austria's ecological problems is being sought in stricter environmental legislation at the domestic level. Ultimately, however, pan-European and global cooperation in the realm of pollution and emission control will be necessary to protect the country's environment.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The [[Seychelles]] is a small [[island nation]] located in the [[Indian Ocean]] northeast of [[Madagascar]] and about {{convert|1600|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} east of [[Kenya]]. Seychelles lies between approximately 4ºS and 10ºS and 46ºE and 54ºE. The nation is an [[archipelago]] of 115 [[Tropics|tropical]] islands, some [[granite]] and some [[coral]]. the majority of which are small and uninhabited. The landmass is only 459&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but the islands are spread over an [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] of 1,374,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. About 90 percent of the population of 90,000 live on [[Mahé, Seychelles|Mahé]], 9 percent on [[Praslin]] and [[La Digue]]. Around a third of the land area is the island of [[Mahé, Seychelles|Mahé]] and a further third the atoll of [[Aldabra]].

There are two distinct regions, the granitic islands, the world's only oceanic islands of granitic rock and the coralline outer islands. The granite islands are the world’s oldest ocean islands, while the outer islands are mainly very young, though the [[Aldabra]] group and St Pierre (Farquhar Group) are unusual, [[Raised coral atoll|raised coral islands]] that have emerged and submerged several times during their long history, the most recent submergence dating from about 125,000 years ago

==Physical features==
The '''Inner Islands''' is the collective term for 45 islands with a total area of 247.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 54% of the Seychelles area but with more than 99% of the population.

The '''Granitic Group''' consists of 45 [[granite]] islands, all within a {{convert|56|km|0|abbr=on}} radius of the main island of [[Mahé, Seychelles|Mahé]]. These islands are rocky, and most have a narrow coastal strip and a central range of hills rising as high as {{convert|914|m|ft|0}}. The most important islands of this group are:
*Mahé is the largest island, with a size of {{convert|156.7|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. [[Victoria, Seychelles|Victoria]], the [[Capital (political)|capital]], is on Mahé.
*[[Praslin Island]],
*[[Silhouette Island]],
*[[La Digue]].
Two '''coralline islands''', at 90&amp;nbsp;km to the north, make up the remainder of the Inner Islands:
*[[Bird Island, Seychelles|Bird Island]]
*[[Denis Island]]

There are also a number of [[artificial island]]s, including [[Romainville Island, Seychelles|Romainville Island]]. 

Millions of years ago, the archipelago was created by a combination of the separation of India from Africa as well as undersea volcanoes similar to those from which [[Mauritius]] and [[Réunion]] were created. Subsequently the vast majority of this huge land area became submerged over time. Seychelles straddles the eastern portion of the [[Somali plate]].

==Outer Islands (also known as Zil Elwannyen Sesel)==
{{main|Outer Islands (Seychelles)}}
The '''Outer Islands''' consist of five groups of coralline islands:
*[[Southern Coral Group]], a collective term for [[Île Platte]] and [[Coëtivy Island]]
*[[Amirante Islands]]
*[[Alphonse Group]] ([[Alphonse Atoll]] and [[St. François Atoll]])
*[[Aldabra Group]] ([[Aldabra]] Atoll, [[Assumption Island]], and the Cosmoledo Group, consisting of [[Cosmoledo]] Atoll and [[Astove Island]])
*[[Farquhar Group]] ([[Farquhar Atoll]], [[Providence Atoll]] and St. Pierre Island)
The Outer Islands comprise 211.3&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (46% of the Seychelles), but less than 1% of the population.

The coral islands are flat with elevated [[coral reefs]] at different stages of formation. They have no [[fresh water]] and can sustain human life only with difficulty.

==Geology==

The Seychelles is part of the granitic [[Mascarene Plateau]] which broke off from the [[Indian Plate]] about 66 [[Mya (unit)|mya]]. This rift formation is associated with the [[Réunion hotspot]] which is also responsible for [[Réunion Island]] and the [[Deccan Traps]] in [[India]]. Because of its long isolation, the Seychelles hosts several unique species including the [[coco de mer]], a [[palm tree|palm]] which has the largest seeds of any plant and the world's largest population of [[giant tortoise]]s.

==Climate==

The climate is equable and healthy, although quite humid, as the islands are small and subject to marine influences. The temperature varies little throughout the year. Temperatures on Mahé vary from {{convert|24|to|30|°C|°F|1}}, and rainfall ranges from {{convert|2900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} annually at [[Victoria, Seychelles|Victoria]] to {{convert|3600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} on the mountain slopes. [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is somewhat less on the other islands. During the coolest months, July and August, it drops to as low as {{convert|24|°C|°F|1}}. The southeast trade winds blow regularly from May to November, and this is the most pleasant time of the year. The hot months are from December to April, with higher humidity (80%). March and April are the hottest months, but the temperature seldom exceeds {{convert|31|°C|°F|1}}. Most of the islands lie outside the cyclone belt, so high winds are rare.

==Flora and fauna==
{{main|Flora and fauna of Seychelles}}
The uniqueness of the Seychelles' ecology is reflected in the US$1.8 million project of the Global Environment Trust Fund of the World Bank (see Glossary) entitled Biodiversity Conservation and Marine Pollution Abatement, that began in 1993. The World Bank study for this project states that the islands contain, out of a total of 1,170 flowering plants, "at least 75 species of flowering plants, 15 of birds, 3 of mammals, 30 of reptiles and amphibians, and several hundred species of snails, insects, spiders and other invertebrates" found nowhere else. The diversity of species in the islands is being assessed by the [[Nature Protection Trust of Seychelles]]. In addition, the waters contain more than 1000 kinds of fish, of which more than one-third are associated with coral reefs. Specific examples of unique birds are the [[Seychelles paradise flycatcher|black paradise flycatcher]], the [[lesser vasa parrot|black parrot]], the brush warbler, and a flightless rail. Most famous of all the Seychelles animals are the [[giant tortoises]] of the genus ''[[Aldabrachelys]]''.

===Environmental threats===
As a result of extensive shipping to Seychelles that brings needed imports and the discharge of commercial [[tuna]] fishing, the waters suffer some pollution. Furthermore, goats brought to Aldabra Islands are destroying much of the vegetation on which giant tortoises feed or seek shade. Rats have reduced biodiversity on many islands. Climate change is also a significant issue; it was recently realised that this has caused the extinction of the endemic snail [[Rhachistia aldabrae]].

Seychelles began addressing the conservation problem in the late 1960s by creating the Nature Conservancy Commission, later renamed the Seychelles National Environment Commission. A system of national parks and animal preserves covering 42% of the land area and about 260&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the surrounding water areas has been set aside. Legislation protects wildlife and bans various destructive practices. In Seychelles' 1990 to 1994 National Development Plan, an effort was made to include in the appropriate economic sectors of the development plan environment and natural resources management aspects.

Also connected with ecology is a World Bank project dealing with the environment and transportation. Launched in 1993 with a loan of US$4.5 million, it is designed to improve the infrastructure of Seychelles with regard to roads and airports or airstrips so as to encourage tourism as a source of income, while simultaneously supporting environmental programs in resource management, conservation, and the elimination of pollution.

Another major project has been funded by Fonds Francais pour l'environnement Mondiale (FFEM) and implemented by [[Island Conservation Society]]. This aims to rehabilitate and enhance islands for the maintenance of native biodiversity in Seychelles through eradication of introduced predator species, rehabilitation of habitats and reintroduction of rare or threatened species. [[Rat]]s have been eliminated from North Island under this project and more schemes are planned, including at Cosmoledo Atoll and on Conception Island.

[[File:Göttingen-Astrolabium.mit.Diopter.und.Kompass.JPG|thumb|A German graphometer in Göttingen, Stadtmuseum.  The instrument is on its side.  At the back, the socket for a [[Jacob's staff]] can be seen.]]
The '''graphometer''', '''semicircle''' or '''semicircumferentor''' is a [[surveying]] instrument used for [[angle]] measurements. It consists of a semicircular [[wiktionary:Limb#Etymology 2|limb]] divided into 180 degrees and sometimes subdivided into minutes. The limb is subtended by the diameter with two [[sight (device)|sights]] at its ends. In the middle of the diameter a "box and needle" ([[compass]]) is fixed. On the same middle the [[alidade]] with two other sights is fitted. The device is mounted on a [[Jacob's staff#Surveying|staff]] via a [[ball and socket]] joint. In effect the device is a half-[[circumferentor]]. For convenience, sometimes another half-circle from 180 to 360 degrees may be [[graduation (instrument)|graduated]] in another line on the limb.&lt;ref name=c1728&gt;{{1728|title=Graphometer}} Pages: vol. 1 p. 179 for "Graphometer", vol. 2 p. 50 for "Semi-Circle"&lt;!-- spelt thusly thence--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The form was introduced in [[Philippe Danfrie]]'s, ''Déclaration de l’usage du graphomètre'' (Paris, 1597) and the term "graphometer" was popular with French geodesists. The preferable English-language terms were semicircle or semicircumferentor. Some 19th-century graphometers had [[telescope|telescopic]] rather than open sights.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Bennett, "The Divided Circle" (Oxford, 1987), pp. 49-50, as quoted in the [http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/surveying/type.cfm?typeid=10 "Graphometer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015125250/http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/surveying/type.cfm?typeid=10 |date=2007-10-15 }} article of the [[Smithsonian]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
[[Image:Open angle with letters.svg|thumb|right|Figure 1: Angle EKG]]
To measure an angle, say, EKG, place the diameter middle C at the angle apex K using the [[Plumb-bob|plummet]] at point C of the instrument. Align the diameter with leg KE of the angle using the sights at the ends of the diameter. Align the alidade with the  leg KG using another pair of sights, and read the angle off the limb as marked by the alidade. Further uses of the graphometer are the same as those of the circumferentor.&lt;ref name=c1728/&gt;

'''Günter Meyer''' (born 25 August 1946) is a German [[Geographer]] and [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]]. He is chairman of the World Congress for Middle Eastern Studies (WOCMES) and director of the Center for Research on the Arab World (CERAW) at the [[University of Mainz]].&lt;ref name="idw-online.de"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://idw-online.de/de/news690414|title=Günter Meyer erneut zum Vorstandsvorsitzenden des Orient-Weltkongresses WOCMES gewählt|website=idw-online.de|language=de|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer focuses mainly on the [[Political Geography]] of the [[Arab World]], and the economic as well as urban development in the [[Middle East]], especially in [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Yemen]] and the [[UAE]], but also in Germany. He became known to a wider German-speaking audience through more than 1100 interviews&lt;ref name="idw-online.de"/&gt; on the [[Iraq War]], the [[Syrian Civil War]] and on the [[Libyan Civil War 2011]] and [[Libyan Civil War (2014–present)|2014]].

==Scientific career==
Meyer studied Geography and English Literature from 1968 to 1973 at the [[University of Erlangen-Nürnberg]] and the [[New University of Ulster]] in Northern Ireland. Back in Erlangen, he took his state exams for higher secondary education in 1973, completed his doctorate in Geography in 1976 and qualified as a university lecturer in 1983 with his post-doctoral thesis and other writings in social geographic studies on developments in rural and nomadic areas.&lt;ref&gt;Ländliche Lebens- und Wirtschaftsformen Syriens im Wandel.  Sozialgeograph. Studien zur Entwicklung im bäuerlichen und nomadischen Lebensraum (= Erlanger geographischen Arbeiten. Sonderband 16). 1984, {{ISBN|3-920405-58-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed Professor in Erlangen. In 1993 he changed to the University of Mainz.

Since the mid-1990s he started an intense networking activity organizing the cooperation of Institutes of Oriental studies and orientalists on a national, European and global level.

He headed the first World Congress on Studies of the Middle East in 2002 (WOCMES) in Mainz. The congress attracted about 2.100 scientists from 68 countries, and 126 journalists from all parts of the world.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allgemeine-zeitung.de/lokales/mainz/nachrichten-mainz/mainzer-geograph-guenter-meyer-bleibt-vorstandsvorsitzender-des-orient-weltkongresses_14312830.htm|title=Mainzer Geograph Günter Meyer bleibt Vorstandsvorsitzender des Orient-Weltkongresses|first=VRM GmbH &amp; Co.|last=KG|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the executive board of WOCMES appointed Meyer again for president. In 2018 he was reelected unanimously for a fifth term of office, until 2022.&lt;ref&gt;://www.allgemeine-zeitung.de/lokales/mainz/nachrichten-mainz/mainzer-geograph-guenter-meyer-bleibt-vorstandsvorsitzender-des-orient-weltkongresses_14312830.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idw-online.de"/&gt;

In 2014 he was awarded the [[Jere L. Bacharach|Jere L. Bacharach Service Award]] by the [[Middle East Studies Association of North America]] (MESA).Meyer was the first European honoured with this award. The award certificate mentioned Meyer's tireless efforts to improve communication and interaction between previously separated, different areas of European scholarship: "This award honors his vision and skill in establishing new institutional networks to the benefit of scholars around the world."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uni-mainz.de/presse/63428.php|title=Günter Meyer erhält Jere L. Bacharach Service Award für Vernetzung der internationalen Orientforschung|first=Johannes Gutenberg-Universität|last=Mainz|website=www.uni-mainz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the chairman of the World Congress of Middle Eastern Studies, Meyer was also in charge of the world congresses in Amman/Jordan, in Barcelona, and in Ankara in August 2014, and is in charge of the congress in Sevilla in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.allgemeine-zeitung.de/lokales/mainz/nachrichten-mainz/guenter-meyer-leitet-an-der-uni-mainz-das-zentrum-der-weltweiten-orientforschung_18634305.htm|title=Günter Meyer leitet an der Uni Mainz das Zentrum der weltweiten Orientforschung|last=KG|first=VRM GmbH &amp; Co.|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions==
=== War in Syria===
As early as 2012 Meyer attracted attention putting forward his view on the external roots of the conflicts within Syria. He saw a massive and abusive outside interference into inner-Syrian affairs. Western powers seemed to be mainly concerned with extinguishing the "Iran-Hezbolla axis". According to Meyer, thousands of mujaheddin had been flown in, because the CIA was intending to initiate a civil war to weaken Syria. The media were ignoring the fact, Meyer said, that the majority of the population was still preferring Assad as head of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU1_7rCUUwk|title=Die Wahrheit über Syrien - Univ. Prof. Dr. Günter Meyer im Bayern2-Interview|first=|last=Peter van Dorren|date=25 January 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the Civil War in Syria Meyer, from the very beginning expressed himself against all endeavors to remove president Bashar al-Assad from office. Before the Russian military intervention, he expressed a rather positive view on the Russian role in the conflict.

Meyer has repeatedly blamed US foreign politics towards Iraq as a main reason for the emergence of Daesh: "Without acting against International Law, without the wrong decision taken by Bremer, and without consciously accepting that a Salafi territory might emerge in Syria's eastern parts, with the CIA even considering giving support, it would have never been possible for ISIS to develop into a global threat."
Giving his view on the consequences of a possible overthrow of president Assad, he referred to a widely known slogan in Syria: „Christians to the Lebanon, the Alawites to the grave". According to Meyer, this slogan indicates the imminent dangers for the regions still controlled by the regime.
In February 2016 Meyer presented his view on plans to depose Assad as early as 2001. In 2006 news had been leaked, that the regime should be "destabilized" by instigating ethnic antagonism. The strategy of supplying weapons the so-called temperate rebel opposition via Libya and Turkey had faltered, because, according to Meyer, those rebels had allied themselves with extremist forces. Turkey was supporting IS willing to do everything possible to prevent the emergence of a Kurdish state. Deposing Assad would cause chaos in Syria, to the sole advantage of extremists. Meyer saw the politics of Russia towards Syria as constructive, he ruled out the possibility of Russia's intentionally intensifying immigration towards Europe. The target of the Russian government was getting back control of part of the country.

In a public debate in June 2016 Meyer expressed doubts about a smooth transition of power in case the Assad regime was dissolved. Two military groups, Al-Nusra and IS, could not have a share in power, also the remaining militias had a salafist or radically islamistic outlook, often hostile against each other, only united temporarily by their common enemity towards Assad.

[[Image:Heihe-tengchong-line.svg|thumb|Heihe-Tengchong Line]]
The '''Heihe–Tengchong Line''' ({{zh|t=黑河–騰衝線|s=黑河–腾冲线|p=Hēihé–Téngchōng xiàn}}), also called the '''[[Aihui District|Aihui]]-Tengchong Line''' (and internationally as the '''Hu line''') is an imaginary line that divides the area of China into two roughly equal parts. It stretches from the city of [[Heihe]] to [[Tengchong]], diagonally across China.

Chinese population geographer [[Hu Huanyong]] imagined the line in 1935 and called it a "geo-demographic demarcation line". As this line was proposed in 1935, the map of China would have included [[Mongolia]] but excluded [[Taiwan]].

This imaginary line divides the territory of China as follows (going by 1935 statistics):

*West of the line: 64% of the area, but only 4% of the population (1935) 
*East of the line: 36% of the area, but 96% of the population (1935)

Despite a large scale urban migration mainly towards coasts but also trending south, 2002 and 2015 statistics remain nearly identical ''vis-à-vis'' the line:

*West of the line: 57% of the area, but only 6% of the population (2002)&lt;ref name="ChineseEconomy"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Chinese Economy: Transitions and Growth |last=Naughton |first=Barry |authorlink=|coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=0-262-14095-0 |pages=18–19  |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;(2015)&lt;ref name="dtc"&gt;http://dtcaijing.baijia.baidu.com/article/473345&lt;/ref&gt; 
*East of the line: 43% of the area, but 94% of the population (2002)&lt;ref name="ChineseEconomy"/&gt;(2015)&lt;ref name="dtc"/&gt;

The minor change in total population percent from 1935 to 2015 is attributed to [[Han Chinese]] migration to urban areas in the autonomous regions of [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]], as well as [[one-child policy]] restrictions on the majority, with exceptions for largely-minority groups west of the line. However, during the 2000-2015 period, population in the west of the line indeed grew faster than the east, but the growth wasn't sufficient to budge the rounded percentages.  Most of this growth was contained in the cities of [[Ürümqi]], [[Lanzhou]], [[Ordos (city)|Ordos]], and [[Yinchuan]], although some tribal non-city areas also registered high growth.  After 80 years, the area west of the Heihe–Tengchong Line remains relatively rural, rugged or inhospitable, underdeveloped and poor as compared to the east.&lt;ref name="dtc"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1396">A '''hreppur''' ({{IPA-is|ˈr̥ɛʰpʏr̥}}) is a rural municipality in [[Iceland]]. These administrative units are primarily made up of rural villages, with few or no towns, and are headed by the "Hreppstjóri".

It is one of the oldest Icelandic administrative units, probably dating back to before 1000&amp;nbsp;AD, when a hreppur had at least twenty [[Freehold (law)|freehold]]ers, although smaller units could be established if the [[Lögrétta]] gave permission. The term ([[Old norse]] ''hreppr'') is mentioned in the [[Gray Goose Laws]] (Grágás) and the [[Law of Iceland]] (Jónsbók).

The "hreppr"  was independent of the chieftain-[[Þing]] structure. It collected and distributed the tithes and mandatory contributions designated for the poor, which were assigned to various households for different lengths of time according to the wealth of the household. The "hreppr" also took charge of an insurance system. A member who lost morethan 1/4 of his herds due to disease was entitled to recover half of the loss.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, William, Bloodtaking and Peacemaking, Feud, Law, and Society in Saga Iceland, University of Chicago Press, 1996, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the term "hreppur" is in decline as urban communities merge into new municipalities.

'''ISO 3166-2:AE''' is the entry for the [[United Arab Emirates]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for the United Arab Emirates, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[emirates of the United Arab Emirates|7 emirates]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|AE}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of the United Arab Emirates. The second part is two letters.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

In [[classical antiquity]], '''Illyria''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|l|ɪər|i|ə}}; {{lang-grc|Ἰλλυρία}}, ''Illyría'' or {{lang|grc|Ἰλλυρίς}}, ''Illyrís'';&lt;ref&gt;''Illyría'' and ''Illyrís'' respectively&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Polybius. ''Histories'', [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0233:book=1:chapter=13 1.13.1]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-la|Illyria}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Charlton T.|last2=Short|first2=Charles|title=A Latin Dictionary|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2321597|chapter=Illyria}}&lt;/ref&gt; see also ''[[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]])'' was a region in the western part of the [[Balkan Peninsula]] inhabited by the [[Illyrians]].  At least most of them spoke [[Illyrian languages]], a group of [[Indo-European languages]], which in ancient times perhaps had speakers in southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;If the [[Messapian language]] was close enough to the Illyrian languages to be considered an Illyrian language, then Illyrian would also have been spoken in southern [[Italy]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prehistory of Southeastern Europe|prehistory]] of Illyria and the [[Illyrians]] is known from archaeological evidence. The [[Roman Republic|Romans]] conquered the region in 168 BC in the aftermath of the [[Illyrian Wars]].

The Roman term '''Illyris''' (distinct from '''''Illyria''''') was sometimes used to define an area north of the [[Aous]] valley, most notably [[Illyris proper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|1982|p=623}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In [[Greek mythology]], the name of Illyria is [[Etiology|aetiologically]] traced to [[Illyrius]], the son of [[Cadmus]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]], who eventually ruled Illyria and became the eponymous ancestor of the Illyrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimal|Maxwell-Hyslop|1996|p=230}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A later version of the myth identifies [[Polyphemus]] and [[Acis and Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]] as parents of [[Celtus]], [[Galas]], and [[Illyrius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimal|Maxwell-Hyslop|1996|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Greek writers used the name "Illyrian" to describe peoples between the [[Liburnians]] and [[Epirus]].{{sfn|Wilkes|1969|p=5}} Fourth-century BC Greek writers clearly separated the people along the Adriatic coast from the Illyrians, and only in the 1st century AD was "Illyrian" used as a general term for all the peoples across the Adriatic.{{sfn|Wilkes|1969|p=161}} Writers also spoke of "Illyrians in the strict sense of the word"; [[Pomponius Mela]] (43 AD) the ''stricto sensu'' Illyrians lived north of the [[Taulantii]] and [[Enchele]], on the Adriatic shore;&lt;ref name="Katicic1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Radoslav Katicic|title=Ancient Languages of the Balkans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSkjAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158|date=1 January 1976|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-156887-4|pages=158–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] used "properly named Illyrians"{{sfn|Wilkes|1969|p=161}} (''Illyrii proprii/proprie dicti'') for a small people{{sfn|Wilkes|1969|p=161}} south of [[Epidaurum]],{{sfn|Wilkes|1969|p=161}} or between [[Epidaurum]] (now [[Cavtat]]) and [[Lissus]] (now [[Lezhë]]).&lt;ref name="Katicic1976"/&gt; In the Roman period, ''Illyricum'' was used for the area between the Adriatic and Danube.{{sfn|Wilkes|1969|p=5}} &lt;ref name="Kos2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marjeta Šašel Kos|title=Appian and Illyricum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=opBpAAAAMAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Narodni Muzej Slovenije|isbn=978-961-6169-36-3|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kingdoms==
{{Main|List of rulers of Illyria|Dardanian Kingdom}}

The earliest recorded Illyrian kingdom was that of the [[Enchele]] in the 8th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stipčević|2002|pages=46–47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The era in which we observe other Illyrian kingdoms begins approximately at 400 BC and ends at 167 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=298}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Autariatae under [[Pleurias]] (337 BC) were considered to have been a kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Boardman|1994|p=785}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingdom of the [[Ardiaei]] began at 230 BC and ended at 167 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1969|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable Illyrian kingdoms and dynasties were those of [[Bardyllis]] of the [[Dardani]] and of [[Agron of Illyria|Agron]] of the [[Ardiaei]] who created the last and best-known Illyrian kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kipfer|2000|p=251}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Agron ruled over the Ardiaei and had extended his rule to other tribes as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1993|p=104}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As for the Dardanians, they always had separate domains from the rest of the [[Illyrians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Papazoglu|1978|p=216}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Illyrian kingdoms were composed of small areas within the region of Illyria. Only the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] ruled the entire region. The internal organization of the south Illyrian kingdoms points to imitation of their neighbouring Greek kingdoms and influence from the Greek and [[Hellenistic]] world in the growth of their [[urban area|urban]] centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=237}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polybius]] gives as an image of society within an Illyrian kingdom as peasant infantry fought under aristocrats which he calls in Greek ''Polydynastae'' (Greek: Πολυδυνάστες) where each one controlled a town within the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The monarchy was established on hereditary lines and Illyrian rulers used marriages as a means of alliance with other powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=167}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (23–79 AD) writes that the people that formed the nucleus of the Illyrian kingdom were 'Illyrians proper' or [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria#Illyrii Proprie Dicti|Illyrii Proprie Dicti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=216}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They were the [[Taulantii]], the [[Pleraei]], the [[Endirudini]], [[Sasaei]], [[Grabaei]] and the [[Labeatae]]. These later joined to form the [[Docleatae]].

==Roman and Byzantine rule==
{{Main|Illyricum (Roman province)|Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum}}

The Romans defeated Gentius, the last king of Illyria, at [[Scodra]] (in present-day Albania) in 168 BC and captured him, bringing him to Rome in 165 BC. Four client-republics were set up, which were in fact ruled by Rome. Later, the region was directly governed by Rome and organized as a [[Roman province|province]], with Scodra as its capital.

[[File:Prefecture of Illyricum map.png|thumb|left|150px|The Prefecture of Illyricum 375-379 (light green).]]

The Roman province of ''Illyricum'' replaced the formerly independent kingdom of Illyria. It stretched from the [[Drin River|Drilon]] river in modern [[Albania]] to [[Istria]] ([[Croatia]]) in the west and to the [[Sava]] river ([[Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina]]) in the north. [[Salona]] (near modern [[Split (city)|Split]] in Croatia) functioned as its capital.

After crushing a [[Great Illyrian Revolt|revolt]] of [[Pannonians]] and [[Daesitiates]], Roman administrators dissolved the province of Illyricum and divided its lands between the new provinces of [[Pannonia]] in the north and [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] in the south. Although this division occurred in 10 AD, the term ''Illyria'' remained in use in [[Late Latin]] and throughout the medieval period. After the [[division of the Roman Empire]], the [[bishops of Thessalonica]] appointed papal vicars for Illyricum. The first of these vicars is said to have been Bishop [[Acholius]] or Ascholius (died 383 or 384), the friend of [[St. Basil]]. In the 5th century, the bishops of Illyria withdrew from communion with Rome, without attaching themselves to Constantinople, and remained for a time independent, but in 515, forty Illyrian bishops renewed their loyalty to Rome by declaring allegiance to [[Pope Hormisdas]]. The patriarchs of Constantinople succeeded in bringing Illyria under their jurisdiction in the 8th century.&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"&gt;{{harvnb|Lins|1910|loc="Illyria"}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Coa Croatia Country Illyria History.svg|thumb|right|135px|Fictional "coat of arms of Illyria" in the 17th-century [[Fojnica Armorial]].]]
The name ''Illyria'' only disappears from the historical record after the [[Ottoman invasion of the Balkans]] in the 15th century, and re-emerges in the 17th century, acquiring a new significance in the [[Ottoman-Habsburg wars|Ottoman–Habsburg Wars]], as [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] designated as the "Illyrian nation" the South Slavs in Hungarian territory.&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"/&gt; Several armorials of the Early modern period, popularly called the "[[Illyrian Armorials]]", depicted fictional coats of arms of Illyria.

The name ''Illyria'' was revived by [[Napoleon]] for the [[Illyrian Provinces]] that were incorporated into the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] from 1809 to 1813, and the [[Kingdom of Illyria (1816–1849)]] was part of [[Austria]] until 1849, after which time it was not used in the reorganised [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].

The [[Illyrian movement]] was a pan-South Slavist ([[Yugoslavism]]) cultural and political campaign by a group of young Croatian and Serbian intellectuals during the first half of the 19th century.

== In popular culture ==

[[William Shakespeare]] chose a fictionalized Illyria as the setting for his play ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (In the modernised film spoof ''[[She's the Man]]'', this function is served by "Illyria High School" in California). An extensive history of Illyria by [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange]], was published by Joseph [[House of Keglević|Keglevich]] in 1746.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|du Fresne|1746|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare also mentioned the region in the [[Henry VI, Part 2|Part 2]] of the play ''[[Henry VI (play)|Henry VI]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry VI, part 2: Entire Play|url=http://shakespeare.mit.edu/2henryvi/full.html|website=shakespeare.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The land of Illyria is the setting for [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[Les Mains Sales]]'' and in [[Lloyd Alexander]]'s ''The Illyrian Adventure''.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

[[John Hawkes (novelist)|John Hawkes]]' 1970 novel ''The Blood Oranges'' is set in a fictionalized Illyria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawkes|first=John|last2=Scholes|first2=Robert|year=1972|title=A Conversation on "The Blood Oranges" between John Hawkes and Robert Scholes |jstor=1345277|journal=NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction|volume=5|issue= 3|pages=203-204, 197-207|doi=10.2307/1345277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the television show ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', Illyria was the name of an Old One (an ancient and powerful demon) who was resurrected in the final season.

In [[Jacqueline Carey]]'s book ''[[Kushiel's Chosen]]'', Illyria is featured as a vassal nation to La Serenissima (Venice).

'''''Jabal An-Nabī Shuʿayb''''' ({{lang-ar|جَبَل ٱلنَّبِي شُعَيْب|lit=Mountain of the Prophet Shu'aib}}) is a mountain of the [[Sarawat Mountains|Sarawat range]] located in [[Sana'a Governorate]], [[Yemen]]. It is the highest mountain of the country and the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. It is one of the most [[prominence|prominent]] peaks in the world and the [[List of Ultras of West Asia|third most prominent peak in the Middle East]].

== Description ==
Its elevation is often reported to be 3,760 metres, but this is not supported by [[SRTM]] data or more recent cartographic sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbase.com/bmcmorrow/image/41334608 Map at pbase.com] Retrieved 2011-11-20&lt;/ref&gt; The height of the mountain is {{convert|3666|m|ft|0}}, and is located near the Yemeni capital city of [[Sana'a]]. Yemen's second highest peak, [[Jabal Tiyal]], is nearly equidistant from the capital as Jabal an-Nabi Shu'aib is. The mountain may seem like a rocky knoll from observation center like the Sana'a-Al Hudayda highway, but from its western face it is a massive mountain rising from about {{convert|1500|–|1600|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This side of the mountain halts clouds burdened with precipitation, causing that side to be relatively fertile. Atop the mountain is a military post with a radar and the shrine of the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic ''Nabī'']] ([[Prophet]]) [[Shuaib|Shu'ayb]]. It is relatively difficult to be allowed to its summit, but restrictions have eased as of late.{{Clarify|date=September 2015}} Although the summit is not snow-capped like its counterparts in northern [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]], there have been reports of snow on the peak and frost in the winter. Wind speeds are very high at the summit.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

'''Juan Olazábal Ramery''' (1860–1937), was a Spanish [[carlism|Carlist]] politician.

==Family and youth==
[[File:1872 nafarroa.jpg|thumbnail|160px|left|1872: a Carlist, a boy, a [[pottok]] and a dog]]
Juan José León Félix Ramón Olazábal Ramery was born to a very distinguished [[Gipuzkoa]]n dynasty,&lt;ref&gt;see Ana Galdós Monfort, Mercedes Tranche Iparraguirre, ''Los Olazábal. Un ejemplo del surgimiento, persistencia y transformación de las élites locales en Irun (Siglos XV-XX)'', [in:] ''Boletín de estudios del Bidasoa'', 26 (2010), pp. 167-183&lt;/ref&gt; much branched and intemarried with a number of other well known local families.&lt;ref&gt;see ''euskalnet'' service available [http://www.euskalnet.net/laviana/gen_bascas/Olazábal.htm here]; see also ''Geni'' genealogical service [http://www.geni.com/people/Juan-Antonio-Olaz%C3%A1bal-Arteaga/6000000018514898052 here], ''Geneanet'' service [http://gw.geneanet.org/sanchiz?lang=en;p=juan+jose+leon+felix+ramon;n=Olazábal+ramery here], and much worse ''Geneallnet'' entry  [http://geneall.net/pt/nome/2167632/juan-de-Olazábal-y-ramery/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Juan Antonio Olazábal Arteaga]], held a number of estates in Eastern part of the province.&lt;ref&gt;Javier Real Cuesta, ''El Carlismo Vasco 1876-1900'', Madrid 1985, {{ISBN|978-84-323-0510-8}}, pp. 117-118, 250&lt;/ref&gt; Following his early death in 1867,&lt;ref&gt;''Juan Antonio Olazábal Arteaga'' entry at ''Geni'' service [http://www.geni.com/people/Juan-Antonio-Olaz%C3%A1bal-Arteaga/6000000018514898052 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Juan and his siblings were raised by their mother, Prudencia Ramery Zuzuarregui.&lt;ref&gt;there seems to be some confusion as to the correct spelling of her segundo apellido. Most sources prefer the “Zuzuarregui” version, see e.g. the ''Ramery y Zuzuarregui, Liborio'' entry at ''Indice Historico de Diputados'' at the official Cortes service available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SDocum/ArchCon/SDHistoDipu/SDIndHistDip?_piref73_1340024_73_1340023_1340023.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXLDA.fmt&amp;DOCS=1-25&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;QUERY=%2893320%29.NDIP. here]. There are authors, however, who prefer the “Zuazarregui” version, see José Antonio Vaca de Osma, ''Los vascos en la historia de España'', Madrid 1995, {{ISBN|8432130958}}, 9788432130953, p. 178. Some sources are inconsistent; the genealogical ''Geni'' service refers to most of the siblings “Zuazarregui”, with the exception of Prudencia, who is named “Zuzuarregui”, see [http://www.geni.com/people/Prudencia-Ramery-Zuzuarregui/6000000018514694730 here]. The contemporary press used "Zuzuarregui", see ''El Siglo Futuro'' 13.01.94 [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000175745&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of the [[Third Carlist War]] the family sought refuge in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Jose Urbano Asarta Epenza, ''Juan de Olazábal Ramery'' entry, [in:] ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia'' online, available [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/116770 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Following their return to Spain Juan was educated in the [[Jesuit]] college in [[Orduña]], where he met and befriended [[Sabino Arana]],&lt;ref&gt;'' Euskera: se empieza inventando un idioma…'' [in:] ''Pais Vasco'' 01.02.05 available [http://nacionalismo.blogs.com/byebyespain/2005/02/euskera_se_empi.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; to proceed with law studies in another Jesuit institute, [[Colegio del Pasaxe]] in the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] [[A Guarda]].&lt;ref&gt;Asarta Epenza, ''Juan de Olazábal Ramery''&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to [[:es:Universidad de Madrid|Universidad Central]] in [[Madrid]],&lt;ref&gt;in an open letter of 1884 he is signed as "estudiante católico de Madrid", ''El Siglo Futuro'' 11.12.84, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000086890&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; to graduate in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;in ''El Siglo Futuro'' 21.03.85 he is already signed as "licenciado", see [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000088877&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the family in some sources is described as Carlist,&lt;ref&gt;Asarta Epenza, ''Juan de Olazábal Ramery''&lt;/ref&gt; in fact its different branches adhered to different political options. Juan’s paternal uncle, [[Ramón Olazábal Arteaga]], as [[Colonel|coronel]] of [[Miquelet (militia)|miqueletes]]&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Apalategui Igarzabal, ''Karlisten eta liberalen gerra-kontaerak'', San Sebastian 2005, {{ISBN|8479074876}}, pp. 41, 43, available [http://www.euskaltzaindia.net/dok/iker_jagon_tegiak/auspoa/59323.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; sided with the [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabelinos]] during the Third Carlist War, growing to commander of the entire formation&lt;ref&gt;Serapio Mugica Zufiria, ''Geografía de Guipúzcoa'', available at Instituto Geografico Vasco site [http://www.ingeba.org/klasikoa/geografi/mug301/g765779.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; and also the civil governor of Irun.&lt;ref&gt;Apalategui 2005, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Juan’s maternal uncle, [[Liborio Ramery Zuzuarregui]],&lt;ref&gt;Asarta Epenza, ''Juan de Olazábal Ramery'', see also ''Liborio Ramery Zuzuarregui'' entry at ''Geni'' service [http://www.geni.com/people/Liborio-Ramery-Zuazarregui/6000000018515995922 here]&lt;/ref&gt; made his name as a Carlist politician, Gipzukoan deputy to the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] and a [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] writer. A distant relative from paternal branch, [[Tirso Olazábal Lardizábal|Tirso de Olazábal y Lardizábal]],&lt;ref&gt;Juan de Olazábal Ramery (b. 1702) and Domingo de Olazábal Ramery (b. 1703) were brothers; Juan Olazábal Ramery was the great-great-great-grandson of the former, while Tirso de Olazábal y Lardizábal was the great-great-grandson of the latter, see euskalnet; for simplified genealogical tree showing relationship between the two, see [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Olazabal.JPG here]&lt;/ref&gt; became head of Gipuzkoan Carlism and one of the national party leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Cortabarria Igartua, ''Tirso de Olazábal Arbelaiz Lardizabal'' entry at ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia'' available [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/116718 here], see also genealogical tree and numerous detailed info pieces at Luis Maria Zavala (ed.), ''La sociedad Vasca del siglo XIX en la correpondencia del archivo de la casa de Zavala'', Lasarte 2008, {{ISBN|9788496288706}}, p. 67 and passim&lt;/ref&gt; It was rather the influence of Juan’s maternal family, especially Liborio, which combined with the Jesuit education formed him as a Carlist. Juan Olazábal has never married and had no children. Some members of the Olazábal family were active as Carlist politicians in the early Francoist era, though they were very distant Juan’s relatives.&lt;ref&gt;the best known is Rafael Olazábal Eulate, active in Carlism between the 1930s and 1950s, see ''euskalnet''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
[[File:Ramón Nocedal, de Manuel Compañy.jpg|thumbnail|170px]]
Already as a student Olazábal engaged in public activity taking part in Carlist-sponsored Catholic initiatives,e.g. protests against [[krausism]]-flavored heterodoxy in education&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 11.12.84 available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000086890&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; or against promotion of figures like [[Giordano Bruno]];&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 21.03.85 available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000088877&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; instead, he advocated Catholic orthodoxy as fundament of public education in Spain. In 1888 both Olazábal Ramery brothers, Juan and Javier,&lt;ref&gt;he was head of public works department in Gipuzkoa, civil engineer specialising in road construction, and head of Integrism in Toledo; died in 1926, see ''El Siglo Futuro'' 21.12.27 available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000431529&amp;page=1 here], ''El Siglo Futuro'' 19.04.28 available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000441126&amp;page=1 here] and ''El Siglo Futuro'' 10.01.89 available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000204504&amp;page=1 here]. His sister Caya was also a Carlist activist, see ''El Siglo Futuro'' 16.05.08, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000274126&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; defected from mainstream Carlism and joined its breakaway branch led by [[Ramón Nocedal Romea|Ramón Nocedal]], known as [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrism]];&lt;ref&gt;in historiography the Integrist secession is interpreted in 4 different ways. Jordi Canal presents 3 of them: as a result of personal conflict between Nocedal and [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Carlos VII]], as a result of ideological conflict within Carlism, as a result of wider European trend - see Jordi Canal i Morell, ''La masonería en el discurso integrista español a finales del siglo XIX: Ramón Nocedal y Romea'', [in:] José Antonio Ferrer Benimeli (ed.), ''Masonería, revolución y reacción'', Alicante 1990, {{ISBN|844047606X}}, p. 774, also his ''Las “muertes” y las “resurrecciones” del carlismo. Reflexiones sobre la escisión integrista de 1888'', [in:] ''Ayer'' 38 (2000), pp. 115-136. Another proposal is advanced by Clemente, who presents Integrism as antidemocratic ideology of the wealthy few who parasitised on popular and democratic Carlism, see Josep Carles Clemente, ''Los días fugaces. El carlismo, de las guerras civiles a la transición'', Cuenca 2013, {{ISBN|9788495414243}}, p. 28, also his ''Breve historia de las guerras carlistas'', Madrid 2011, {{ISBN|8499671691}}, 9788499671697, pp. 7-18&lt;/ref&gt; they followed the example of their uncle Liborio, who entered the Integrist executive as secretario of junta central.&lt;ref&gt;Jordi Canal i Morell, ''Banderas blancas, boinas rojas: una historia política del carlismo, 1876-1939'', Madrid 2006, {{ISBN|8496467341}}, 9788496467347, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889 they were already active in various minor Integrist public initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 17.06.89 available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000134135&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Juan returned to Gipuzkoa, building the party structures and mobilising its popular support in the province, which soon turned out to be a national Integrist stronghold.&lt;ref&gt;detailed account in María Obieta Villalonga, ''Los integristas guipuzcoanos.

In the late 1890s the Gipuzkoan Integrism underwent a major crisis, though its nature remains disputed. One theory highlights the alliance strategy; Nocedal changed his recommendations, suggesting coalitions with parties offering the best deal instead of the most approximate ones. Another theory attributes the conflict to nationalist penchant of the dissenters.&lt;ref&gt;see ''Integrismo'' entry at ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia'', available [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/68615/50253 here]&lt;/ref&gt; As they refused to step in line, the rebels, headed by [[Pedro Grijalba]], [[Ignacio Lardizábal]] and [[Aniceto de Rezola]], were expulsed by the provincial Junta.&lt;ref&gt;Real Cuesta 1985, pp. 122-127&lt;/ref&gt; Since the outcasts&lt;ref&gt;the rebellious group, named Fueristas, tried to consolidate their position on the platform of regionalism and falling short of embracing Basque nationalism. It eventually disintegrated in 1898-1899, Real Cuesta 1985, pp. 122-127&lt;/ref&gt; controlled a provincial Gipuzkoan Integrist daily ''El Fuerista'',&lt;ref&gt;few years earlier, during the crisis within Navarrese Integrism related to the stance taken by Arturo Campion, ''El Fuerista'' remained firmly in line with the party and lambasted the dissenters, see María Obieta Vilallonga, ''La escisión del «Tradicionalista» de Pamplona del seno del Partido Integrista(1893): la actitud de «El Fuerista» de San Sebastián'', [in:] ''Principe de Viana'' 49 (1988), pp. 307-316&lt;/ref&gt; Olazábal was asked to compensate for the loss; in 1897 he set up a new party newspaper, the San Sebastian-based ''[[:es:La Constancia (1897-1936)|La Constancia]]''; initially it appeared with a sub-title ''Diario Integro Fuerista'', later changed to ''Diario Integrista'',&lt;ref&gt;since August 1921&lt;/ref&gt; ''Diario Integro-Tradicionalista''&lt;ref&gt;since September 1930&lt;/ref&gt; and finally, ''Diario Tradicionalista''.&lt;ref&gt;since June 1932&lt;/ref&gt; His personal property,&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo González Calleja, ''La prensa carlista y falangista durante la Segunda República y la Guerra Civil (1931-1937)'', [in:] ''El Argonauta español'' 9 (2012), available [http://argonauta.revues.org/819 here], also Antonio Checa Godoy, ''Prensa y partidos políticos durante la II República'', Salamanca 1989, {{ISBN|8474815215}}, 9788474815214, p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; it was published until 1936 and, apart from being an official paper of Gipuzkoan Integrism for 34 years,&lt;ref&gt;until 1932, when Integrism amalgamated within mainstream Carlism&lt;/ref&gt; until the end it remained sort of Olazábal’s personal political and ideological tribune.&lt;ref&gt;digital ''La Constancia'' archive for 1900-1936 is available [http://liburutegidigitala.donostiakultura.com/Liburutegiak/catalogo_archivo.php?dp_id=113 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last years of the 19th century venomous hostility between Integrists and mainstream Carlists gave way to rapprochement,&lt;ref&gt;Jose María Remirez de Ganuza López, ''Las Elecciones Generales de 1898 y 1899 en Navarra'', [in] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 49 (1988), pp. 384&lt;/ref&gt; commenced in Gipuzkoa. Its result was a provincial electoral alliance. In [[Azpeitia]], where two branches of Traditionalism used to compete, the Carlist candidate [[Teodoro Arana Belaustegui]] was withdrawn&lt;ref&gt;''Teodoro Arana Belaustegui'' entry at ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia'' available [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/2173 here]; during the [[Spanish general election, 1899|1899 elections]] the Carlists, considering another insurgency, did not field official candidates, though individual candidates were allowed ("no habrá diputados carlistas en las próximas elecciones, pero podrá haber carlistas diputados"), Remirez 1988, p. 382, see also Real Cuesta 1985, pp. 189-191&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of the Integrists. Their candidate turned out to be Olazábal,&lt;ref&gt;initially the Integrist candidate was [[Joaquin Pavia]], replaced shortly before the elections for unknown reasons, see Real Cuesta 1985, p. 191, also ''El Siglo Futuro'' 18.04.99 available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000206664&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; elected also by Carlist votes&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 360; mainstream Carlists claimed that victorious Olazábal was their candidate, which, given the alliance concluded, was formally correct, ''El Siglo Futuro'' 18.04.99&lt;/ref&gt; to the Cortes.&lt;ref&gt;see ''Olazabal y Ramery, Juan'' entry at ''Indice Historico de Diputados'' official Cortes service, available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SDocum/ArchCon/SDHistoDipu/SDIndHistDip?_piref73_1340024_73_1340023_1340023.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXLDA.fmt&amp;DOCS=1-25&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;QUERY=%2881670%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt; The years of 1899-1901 were his only term in the parliament; during the successive elections the Azpeitia mandate – virtually ensured for the party – was claimed by other Integrist politicians.

For reasons which remain rather unclear&lt;ref&gt;none of the sources consulted offers any information as to why Olazábal did not prolong his parliamentary career; it appears to be his choice and not the result of electoral defeats, as neither scholarly works nor contemporary press mentions Olazábal running for the Cortes after 1901&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 20th century Olazábal abandoned national politics and dedicated himself to the local Gipuzkoan issues. In 1904-1906 he engaged in a broad coalition&lt;ref&gt;including the Liberals, Conservatives, Integrists, mainstream Carlists and Republicans, but excluding the Nationalists and Socialists, Javier G. Chamorro, ''El Grande Oriente. Episodio Nacional, Madrid, 1821'', Donostia 2009, {{ISBN|8461323955}}, 9788461323951, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; named [[Liga Foral Autonomista de Guipúzcoa]] and became its second vicepresident.&lt;ref&gt;Asarta Epenza, ''Juan de Olazábal Ramery''&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance declared itself dedicated to traditional provincial [[fueros]] and identified fiscal and administrative autonomy as its goals.&lt;ref&gt;see its program at ''gipuzkoa.net'' service available [http://w390w.gipuzkoa.net/WAS/CORP/DBKVisorBibliotecaWEB/visor.do?ver&amp;amicus=178878&amp;amicusArt=321573 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Its immediate objective was negotiating a new [[Concierto económico]] with Madrid and indeed, a contemporary scholar considers the grouping simply a vehicle for pursuing economic goals of local industry tycoons.&lt;ref&gt;Chamorro 2009, p. 207; for detailed account see Luis Castells, ''Fueros y conciertos económicos.

Broad and loose political rapprochement of Gipuzkoan parties pursuing regionalist&lt;ref&gt;i.e. Gipuzkoan, not those covering [[Names of the Basque Country (in Spanish)|Vascongadas]] or the broader Vasco-Navarrese region&lt;/ref&gt; goals produced Olazábal’s success in elections to [[:es:Diputación Foral de Guipúzcoa|Diputación Provincial]]&lt;ref&gt;consisting of 12 members,4 from each of 3 districts: Irun, Tolosa and Sebastian, Antonio Cillán Apalategui, ''Elecciones a diputados provinciales en Guipuzcoa el año 1911'', [in:] ''Historia'' 22 (1977), p. 127, available [http://www.memoriadigitalvasca.es/bitstream/10357/6642/1/na%20276562001.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1907&lt;ref&gt;Asarta Epenza, ''Juan de Olazábal Ramery''&lt;/ref&gt; and 1911,&lt;ref&gt;Cillán Apalategui 1977, p. 123, also Asarta Epenza, ''Juan de Olazábal Ramery''&lt;/ref&gt; in 1914 serving as member of its [[Comisión Provincial]].&lt;ref&gt;''Guia Oficial de España'' 1914, p. 622, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001011466&amp;page=612 here]&lt;/ref&gt; He is noted not only for work promoting traditional local legal establishments,&lt;ref&gt;see numerous references to Olazabal's activity on autonomy in Idioia Estornés Zubizarreta, ''La construction de una nacionalidad Vasca.

==''Jefe''==
[[File:Amara Errondotik urumea.jpg|thumbnail|left|San Sebastian, early 20th century]]
In the early 20th century Olazábal emerged as one of key Integrist politicians.&lt;ref&gt;along [[José Sánchez Marco|José Sanchez Marco]], Juan Antonio Sanchez del Campo, Juan Lamamie de Clairac and Manuel Senante&lt;/ref&gt; His position was ensured as since the death of [[Ramón Zavala Salazar]] in 1899&lt;ref&gt;see ''Ramón Miguel María Julián Severino de Zavala y Salazar'' entry at ''Geni'' service, available [http://www.geni.com/people/Ram%C3%B3n-de-Zavala-y-Salazar/6000000020882273881 here]&lt;/ref&gt; he was heading the party in its national stronghold.&lt;ref&gt;some claim that it was Olazábal who built the party strength in Gipuzkoa after the death of Nocedal, see Ignacio Arana Pérez, ''Historia contemporánea del Pais Vasco'', section 4.45.5. ''La lucha por la autonomia'', Leioa 2008, p. 4, available [http://www.celing.net/ingenieria/=/c1220080425.pdf here]. The issue of Gipuzkoan leadership is not entirely clear; the 1906 organigram of the provincial party structures names Olazábal merely as secretary of the local San Sebastian junta and president of the local Irun junta, see ''El Siglo Futuro'' 22.05.06, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000259954&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of Ramón Nocedal early 1907, leadership of the Integrist organization, [[:es:Partido Católico Nacional|Partido Católico Nacional]], was assumed by a triuumvirate,&lt;ref&gt;José Sanchez Marco, Benito de Guinea and Juan Olazábal, ''El Siglo Futuro'' 11.04.07 available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000266299&amp;page=1 here]; Asarta Epenza, ''Juan de Olazábal Ramery'' claims the triuumvirate consisted of Juan de Olazábal, José Sánchez Marco y Manuel Aznar&lt;/ref&gt; though few months later Olazábal became Presidente del Consejo.&lt;ref&gt;apart from leadership of the Gipuzkoan branch, see ''El Siglo Futuro'' 11.06.07, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000267394&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909&lt;ref&gt;During Asamblea de Zaragoza&lt;/ref&gt; he was elected the official party leader,&lt;ref&gt;Estornés Zubizarreta 1990, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; also nominated honorary president of a number of local Integrist juntas.&lt;ref&gt;like those in Navarre, ''El Siglo Futuro'' 16.07.09, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000282878&amp;page=2 here], in Andalusia, see ''El Siglo Futuro'' 26.07.12, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000306464&amp;page=1 here] or in Murcia, see ''El Siglo Futuro'' 09.01.13, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000310126&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Olazábal's leadership style was rather unobtrusive. Residing in San Sebastian he was away from great national politics; he did not compete for the Cortes and it was minority parliamentarian speaker, [[Manuel Senante Martinez|Manuel Senante]], acting as party representative in Madrid. Though formally the owner of national Integrist daily, ''[[El Siglo Futuro]]'',&lt;ref&gt;González Calleja 2012&lt;/ref&gt; he left Senante to manage the newspaper and seldom contributed as an author, concentrating rather on ''La Constancia''. Finally, during political negotiations with other parties, he authorised the others to represent Partido Católico Nacional.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. during the 1914 talks on forging a broad Catholic alliance with the conservatives and the Jaimistas it was Senante representing Integrismo, Cristóbal Roblez Muñoz, ''Jesuitas e Iglesia Vasca. Los católicos y el partido conservador (1911-1913)'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' (1991), p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of political course Olazábal followed Nocedal closely. The fundamental assumption was that all public activity should be guided by Catholic principles and executed in line with the Roman Catholic teaching. In day-to-day activities it boiled down to opposing [[secularisation]] and defending the Church, as demonstrated during [[:es:Ley del candado|Ley de Candado]] crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Asarta Epenza, ''Juan de Olazábal Ramery''&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary threads were promoting traditional regional establishments&lt;ref&gt;the party sided with the Catalanists in wake of the [[:es:Ley de Jurisdicciones|Ley de Jurisdicciones]] crisis , Asarta Epenza, ''Juan de Olazábal Ramery''&lt;/ref&gt; and fighting democracy, especially parties combining nationalism and socialism.&lt;ref&gt;see Olazábal’s ''Errores nacionalistas y afirmacion Vasca'' (1919), available [http://atzoatzokoa.gipuzkoakultura.net/c34f2/index.php here]. Josep Carles Clemente, ''Historia del carlismo contemporaneo'', Barcelona 1977, p. 15 summarises Integrism as combination of 6 threads: adherence to French traditionalism (reason and natural law marginalised), manicheism, falsification of history, inquisitorial instincts, hostility to freedom of opinion, conservatist and capitalist ideology&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the monarchy Integrism remained ambiguous, with some sections of the party favoring different dynastical visions&lt;ref&gt;it is not unrelated that during the [[First World War]] Olazábal joined [[Liga Neutralista]], a lobbying group acting in favour of the [[Central Powers]], considered closer to traditional model than the democratic [[Entente cordiale|Entente]], see Pedro Barruso Barés, ''San Sebastian en los siglos XIX y XX'', [in:] ''Geografia e historia de Donostia-San Sebastian'', available [http://www.ingeba.org/liburua/donostia/46contem/46contem.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; and some leaning towards accidentalism, prepared to accept a republican project.&lt;ref&gt;"Tres tendencias se van señalando entonces en el integrismo. Una, de acercamiento dinástico,generalmente de católicos procedentes de la aristocracia; otra, más señalada como antidinástica y tendentea pactar con los carlistas, pero sin refundirse con ellos, y una tercera, que partiendo de la accidentalidad delas formas de gobierno, aceptaría incluso una república del tipo de la de García Moreno en el Ecuador. Sin embargo,la unidad del partido integrista no se quebrantó, por la misma accidentalidad de las formas degobierno",  [[Melchor Ferrer Dalmau|Melchor Ferrer]], Historia del tradicionalismo Español, vol. XVIII, Sevilla 1959, pp. 302-303&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrism, conceived by Nocedal as political arm of Spanish Catholicism,&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio Fernández Sarasola, ''Los partidos políticos en el pensamiento español: de la Ilustración a nuestros días'', Barcelona 2009, {{ISBN|8496467953}}, 9788496467958, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; has never gained more than lukewarm support of the bishops, alienated by its belligerent intransigence.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer 1959, pp. 302-303&lt;/ref&gt; During the Olazábal leadership things went from bad to worse, as the party was increasingly out of tune with the new Church policy. In the early 20th century the Spanish hierarchy abandoned its traditional strategy of influencing key individuals within the liberal monarchy,&lt;ref&gt;some scholars claim that the 19th century reluctance of the Church to sponsor its own Catholic political movement might have contributed to persistence of Integrism, see Feliciano Montero García, ''El movimiento católico en la España del siglo XX. Entre el integrismo y el posibilismo'', [in:] María Dolores de la Calle Velasco, Manuel Redero San Román (eds.), ''Movimientos sociales en la España del siglo XX'', Salamanca 2008, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; and switched to mass mobilisation&lt;ref&gt;the process was divided into 4 phases: 1) congresos catolicos of 1890-1903, 2) Lligas Católicas of 1903-1905, 3) malmenorismo of 1905-1910 and 4) targeted campaigns from 1910 onwards, see Rosa Ana Gutiérrez Lloret, ''¡A las urnas. En defensa de la Fe! La movilización política Católica en la España de comienzos del siglo XX'', [in:] ''Pasado y Memoria. Revista de Historia Contemporánea'' 7 (2008), pp. 240-241&lt;/ref&gt; carried by means of broad&lt;ref&gt;in 1906 integrism was disqualified by the Spanish hierarchy as a political option; the church opted for possibilism, Montero Garcia 2008, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; popular structures and party politics.&lt;ref&gt;since Congreso de Burgos (1899) Leon XIII intended to create a common front of Catholic parties, co-ordinated by some sort of Junta central coordinadora and based on a program titled ''Bases y un programa común'', Montero Garcia 2008, p. 178, Gutiérrez Lloret 2008, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; The Integrists were reluctant to be one of many Catholic parties,&lt;ref&gt;though they participated in different Catholic alliances, for 1914 see Roblez Muñoz 1991, p. 224, for 1921 see Orella Martinez 2012, p. 238, also pp. 73, 80, 81&lt;/ref&gt; despised the democratic format of policy-making&lt;ref&gt;Olazábal many times intervened with the primate and even in Vatican against what he perceived as promoting liberalism, see his actions against Gonzalo Coloma (brother of [[Luis Coloma|Padre Coloma]]) by Roblez Muñoz 1991, pp. 208-209, and in conflict with some bishops, see Cristóbal Robles, Cristóbal Robles Muñoz, ''José María de Urquijo e Ybarra: opinión, religión y poder'', Madrid 1997, {{ISBN|8400076680}}, 9788400076689, pp. 329. The Integrists straightforwardly condemned [[Grupo de la Democracia Cristiana]] (Maximiliano Arboleya Martíne, Severino Aznar) in 1919 and maintained anti-modernist stance, Montero Garcia 2008, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; and refused to accept "[[Lesser evil|malmenorismo]]".&lt;ref&gt;papal document ''Inter Catolicos Hispaniae'' advised accidentalism and the politics of lesser evil; it was followed by ''Las Normas para la acción social y política de los católicos españoles'', issued by the primate, Montero Garcia 2008, pp. 179-180; Gutiérrez Lloret 2008, pp. 249-250 presents the document as tailored to avoid divisions among Spanish Catholics, though its advocacy of malmenorismo was anyway rejected by Integrism&lt;/ref&gt; Since Olazábal cultivated traditionalist vision of Catholic political engagement,&lt;ref&gt;confronted by the new christian-democratic strategy as reactionary and outdated, Montero Garcia 2008, pp. 244-5&lt;/ref&gt; in 1910s and 1920s Partido Católico Nacional was dramatically outpaced by new breed of modern christian-democratic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;like [[:es:Asociación Católica Nacional de Propagandistas|Asociación Católica Nacional de Propagandistas]], [[Acción Catolica]], [[Confederación de Estiudantes Católicos]] or [[Juventud Católica Española]]; the new strategy initially fared badly in Gipuzkoa, where the Catholic Lligas were losing to Integrism, see Montero Garcia 2008, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

Refusing to take part in [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|primoderiverista]] structures Olazábal focused on ''La Constancia'';&lt;ref&gt;publishing also separate booklets: ''Historia contemporánea: liquidando cuentas: cuestiones candentes que interesan a todos los vascos'' (1918), ''Errores nacionalistas y afirmación vasca'' (1919), ''El sufragio universal, el nacionalismo y los fueros'' (1919), ''En defensa del propietario rural guipuzcoano: colección de articulos'' (1930), ''Nuestro fuero y reyes de Castilla'' (1932); the most notable is, however, a 650-page ''El [[Manuel Santa Cruz Loidi|cura Santa Cruz]] guerillero'' (1928), intended as polemics with a competitive vision of the famour priest, presented by [[Pío Baroja]] in ''La Voz de Guipúzcoa''; see ''Catálogo del fondo histórico vasco'', Bilbao 2009, {{ISBN|8498308526}}, 9788498308525, p. 251, available [https://books.google.com/books?id=EG7vuC5AloIC&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=la+constancia+san+sebastian&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ypyFVLb0B6fCywOQh4KADw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=la%20constancia%20san%20sebastian&amp;f=false here]&lt;/ref&gt; his 10-hectare&lt;ref&gt;Luisa Utanda Moreno, Francisco Feo Parrondo, ''Propiedad rústica en Guipúzcoa según el registro de la propiedad expropiable (1933)'', [in:] ''Lurralde: Investigación y espacio'', 18 (1995); the authors erroneously claim that [[Rafael Olazábal Eulate]] was Juan’s son&lt;/ref&gt; Mundaiz estate&lt;ref&gt;where he lived together with his senile mother (she died in 1932 at the age of 90, see ''El Siglo Futuro'' 16.04.32) and two sisters&lt;/ref&gt; became an Integrist shrine.&lt;ref&gt;dubbed "alcázar del Integrismo", see Apalategui Igarzabal 2005, p. 57, or "Kremlin del Integrismo", see Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''La continuidad ideológica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil'' [PhD thesis], Valencia 2009, p. 319; in 1956 the Olazábal family sold part of the estate, enabling construction of a Catholic college, see [http://www.mundaiz.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=87 here]; another part of the estate forms a Cristina Enea park, see [http://www.cristinaenea.org/pagina.php?queidioma=1&amp;pg=9 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Though Partido Católico Nacional was suspended, its offshoot organizations continued to function. Controlling them was getting increasingly difficult. In 1927 Olazábal expulsed the entire San Sebastian branch of [[Juventud Integrista]],&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 24.09.27, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000435509&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; a severe loss given its leader, [[:es:Ignacio María Echaide Lizasoain|Ignacio Maria Echaide]], launched the Juventud in 1910-1914.&lt;ref&gt;he left to pursue the independent politics of Basque Christian-Democracy, see ''euskonews'' service available [http://www.euskonews.com/0508zbk/efem50803es.html here], also ''euskaltzaindia'' available [http://www.euskaltzaindia.net/dok/euskera/50603.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 Integrism re-emerged as [[Comunión Tradicionalista-Integrista (Spanish party, 1930-1932)|Comunión Tradicionalista-Integrista]]. Still headed by Olazábal&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 11.04.30 available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000469914&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; it maintained local branches in almost all Spanish provinces&lt;ref&gt;except [[Canary Islands]], see ''El Siglo Futuro'' 20.03.30, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000468968&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and re-affirmed its traditional principles, though with little electoral success.&lt;ref&gt;in the last elections before advent of the Republic, the municipal vote of April 1931, the Integrists, apart from some success in the Vasco-Navarrese area, recorded few seats won also in Catalonia and Andalusia, Blinkhorn 1975, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Republic and war==
[[File:Almanac La Traca 1933.jpg|thumbnail|160px|left|secular propaganda]]
Militant [[Second Spanish Republic|republican]] secularism was acknowledged by the Integrists as a barbarian onslaught against the very foundations of civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;compare ''El Siglo Futuro'' 12.05.31, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000485608&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Overwhelmed be the Leftist sway, Olazábal realized that his party stood little chance of surviving on its own.&lt;ref&gt;there were 3 Integrist politicians elected in the 1931 elections, but they were all running as “agrarian” candidates: Jose Lamamie de Clairac in Salamanca, Ricardo Gómez Roji and Francisco Estévanez Rodrigues in Burgos, Blinkhorn 1975, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The row between traditionalist Integrism and modern [[christian-democratic]] groupings was already too wide and very few in the party considered rapprochement.&lt;ref&gt;there has never been any serious debate whether the Integrists should join any of the Catholic parties instead of Carlism, Montero Garcia 2008, pp. 186-190&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, ultraconservative vision of religion was shared by mainstream Carlists; as a result, Integristas rather unanimously&lt;ref&gt;in some provinces of Spain it was even the Integros leading the way in the unification talks, Blinkhorn 1075, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; decided to swallow their accidentalism. Following 44 years of separate political existence Olazábal led them&lt;ref&gt;he was heading the reunification talks personally, see interview with Manuel Fal Conde by José Carlos Clemente, [in:] ''Tiempo de historia'' 39 (1978), pp. 13-23, referred after 
[http://elcaballerodeltristedestino.blogspot.com/2012_04_01_archive.html this site]
&lt;/ref&gt; to 1932&lt;ref&gt;Olazábal formally resigned as head of the Integrist party in February 1932, Manuel Ferrer Muñoz, ''Los frustrados intentos de colaboración entre el partido nacionalista vasco y la derecha navarra durante la segunda república'', [in:] ''Principe de Viana'' 49 (1988), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; reunification within Carlism, into the party named [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista|Comunión Tradicionalista]].&lt;ref&gt;and dubbed "Guardia Civil de la Iglesia" by an unsympathetic historian, see Fermín Pérez-Nievas Borderas, ''Contra viento y marea'', Estella 1999, {{ISBN|8460589323}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

Within consolidated Carlism the former Integrists remained a very influential group. By means of a new publishing house, [[Editorial Tradicionalista]], they continued to control ''El Siglo Futuro'', which became a semi-official Carlist daily.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial Tradicionalista was set up specifically to neutralize the Integrist influence, but the plan came to nothing as Senante and Lamamie dominated in the board. It was only its new composition, reconstituted in December 1933, which ensured closer amalgamation of ''El Siglo Futuro'' within the Carlist propaganda machinery, Blinkhorn 1975, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; Many former Integros, like a Cantabrian [[José Luis Zamanillo González-Camino|Jose Luis Zamanillo]], Castillano [[José María Lamamié de Clairac|José Lamamie]], Alicantino Manuel Senante or Andalusian [[Manuel Fal Conde|Manuel Fal]] assumed top positions within the party.&lt;ref&gt;Fal became the party leader, Zamanillo head of the Requete section, Lamamie presided over the Secretariat and Senante kept editing ''El Siglo Futuro''&lt;/ref&gt; Olazábal, due to his age hardly involved in day-to-day business, became sort of a mentor and moral authority. The visible Integrist impact on Comunión Tradicionalista triggered some grumblings among Carlists, especially among the [[Navarre]]se.

Olazábal kept lambasting secular republicanism,&lt;ref&gt;he became notorious for explaining floods as God’s punishment, measured against peasants working on Sundays, see William A. Christian, ''Visionaries: The Spanish Republic and the Reign of Christ'', Berkeley 1996, {{ISBN|0520200403}}, 9780520200401, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; which cost ''El Siglo Futuro'' and ''La Constancia'' periodical administrative suspensions (the first one in August 1931) and Olazábal himself a police detention;&lt;ref&gt;Carlist press compared the republican detentions to fascist or soviet measures, see the "como Mussolini! como Lenin!" heading of ''El Siglo Futuro'' 22.08.31 [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000489661&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; he spent three days in jail.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Always championing local traditional establishments, he was profoundly disappointed by turn of the Basque cause.&lt;ref&gt;until 1932 Olazabal hoped that the Basques would return to the Integrist core, see ''Euskera: se empieza inventando un idioma''…&lt;/ref&gt; He denounced the initial autonomy draft&lt;ref&gt;produced by the Academy of Basque Studies, Blinkhorn 1975, pp. 48-9&lt;/ref&gt; as godless, considering also the [[:es:Estatuto Vasco-Navarro|Estella Statute]] version anti-religious&lt;ref&gt;Asarta Epenza, ''Juan de Olazábal Ramery''&lt;/ref&gt; and anti-fuerist.&lt;ref&gt;he criticised the unitarian nature of autonomy, which he deemed to have been against traditional vision of separate provincial laws and institutions&lt;/ref&gt; Within the united Carlist community he and [[Víctor Pradera Larumbe|Victor Pradera]] led the anti-statute group, as opposed to the pro-statute Carlists represented by [[José Luis de Oriol y Urigüen|José Luis Oriol]] and [[Marcelino Oreja Elósegui|Marcelino Oreja]].&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The divided Carlists refrained from taking a clear political stance, which eventually contributed to failure of the autonomy project.&lt;ref&gt;detailed analysis in Santiago de Pablo, ''El carlismo guipuzcoano y el Estatuto Vasco'', [in:] ''Bilduma Rentería'' 2 (1988), p. 193-216, available 
[http://www.errenteria.net/es/ficheros/40_9775es.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|Carlist standard]]
It is not clear whether Olazábal was engaged in Carlist preparations to rebellion and whether he was even aware of the forthcoming insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;he is not named by any of the sources consulted, especially by the most detailed study, Juan Carlos Peñas Bernaldo de Quirós, ''El Carlismo, la República y la Guerra Civil (1936-1937). De la conspiración a la unificación'', Madrid 1996, {{ISBN|8487863523}}, 9788487863523&lt;/ref&gt; Following the outbreak of hostilities he remained in San Sebastian, where the coup failed, and went on editing ''La Constancia''.&lt;ref&gt;Asarta Epenza, ''Juan de Olazábal Ramery''&lt;/ref&gt; He was detained on one of the ships anchored in San Sebastian and later moved to the Bilbao Angeles Custodios prison. Since the Basque government did not deploy autonomous police to protect the building during the unrest,&lt;ref&gt;some sources claim there were no police units available, see José Manuel Azcona Pastor, Julen Lezamiz Lugarezaresti, ''Los asaltos a las cárceles de Bilbao el día 4 de enero de 1937'', [in:] ''Investigaciones históricas'' 32 (2012), pp. 230; some sources claim the Basque government refused to deploy police troops fearing outbreak of hostilities between UGT and PNV, see Jon Juaristi, ''Turbas'' [in:] ''El Imparcial'' 25.06.14, available [http://www.elimparcial.es/noticia/26327/nacional/turbas here]&lt;/ref&gt; caused by the nationalist bombing raid over the city, the prison was entrusted to the [[Unión General de Trabajadores|UGT]] militia unit. On January 4 the socialist militiamen executed around 100 prisoners;&lt;ref&gt;full list in Azcona, Lezamiz 2012, pp. 235-6&lt;/ref&gt; some were killed by hand grenades thrown into the cells, some were shot and some were reportedly slashed with machetes.&lt;ref&gt;Juaristi 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear how exactly Juan Olazábal died.&lt;ref&gt;detailed accounts differ; Pedro Barruso Barés, ''La represión en las zonas republicana y franquista del País Vasco durante la Guerra Civil'', [in:] ''Historia Contemporánea'' 35 (2007), pp. 653-681 identifies the perpetrators as "incontrolados" militants of CNT and UGT, while the anarchists denied any responsibility, see their account ''La manipulación de la Memoria Histórica'', [in:] ''CNT Gipuzkoa'', available [http://gipuzkoa.cnt.es/spip.php?article388 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Georgia (country)}}
A '''municipality''' ({{lang-ka|მუნიციპალიტეტი}}, ''munits'ipaliteti'') is a subdivision of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], consisting of a settlement or a group of settlements, which enjoys [[Local government in Georgia (country)|local self-government]]. There are two types of municipalities—self-governing [[List of cities and towns in Georgia (country)|cities]] (ქალაქი, ''k'alak'i''), 12 in total, and self-governing [[Community (administrative division)|communities]] (თემი, temi), 67 in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mreg.reestri.gov.ge/|title=Registry of Municipalities|publisher=National Agency of Public Registry|accessdate=January 23, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202020853/https://mreg.reestri.gov.ge/|archivedate=February 2, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The municipalities were first established in 2006. Most of them were successors to the earlier subdivisions, known as ''[[raioni]]'' (რაიონი), "districts". In addition, new municipalities were formed to govern those settlements in the disputed entities of [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]] that then remained under Georgia's control. After the [[Russo-Georgian War]] of 2008, Georgia treats these municipalities as parts of its [[Occupied territories (Georgia)|occupied territories]]. The former districts not under Georgia's effective sovereignty at the moment of the local government reform of 2006 were not transformed into municipalities. Rather, the laws of Georgia include a notion that the final mode of subdivision and system of local self-government should be established after the restoration of the state jurisdiction over the occupied territories.&lt;ref name=pres&gt;{{cite web|title=ტერიტორიული მოწყობა და მმართველობა [Territorial Structure and Government]|url=https://president.gov.ge/ge/Georgia/TerritorialStructureAndGovernment|publisher=Administration of the President of Georgia|accessdate=9 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710064058/https://president.gov.ge/ge/Georgia/TerritorialStructureAndGovernment|archivedate=10 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1958-IIს"&gt;{{cite act |title=ადგილობრივი თვითმმართველობის კოდექსი [Code of Local Self-Government] |type=Organic law |number=1958-IIს |language=Georgian |date=5 February 2014 |article= |articletype= |url=https://matsne.gov.ge/ka/document/view/2244429 |accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the system of local government was further reformed and a total number of municipalities were increased at the expense of adding more self-governing cities. Each municipality is divided into administrative units (ადმინისტრაციული ერთეული), which can comprise one or several settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transparency remains a challenge for self-governing cities|url=http://transparency.ge/en/node/4777|publisher=Transarency International Georgia|accessdate=9 July 2015|date=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The municipalities outside the two [[autonomous republic]]s of [[Adjara]] and of [[Abkhazia]] and the capital city of [[Tbilisi]] are grouped, on a provisional basis, into nine regions (''[[mkhare]]''): [[Guria]], [[Imereti]], [[Kakheti]], [[Kvemo Kartli]], [[Mtskheta-Mtianeti]], [[Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti]], [[Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti]], [[Samtskhe-Javakheti]], and [[Shida Kartli]].&lt;ref name=pres/&gt;

==Signed Stories==
Signed Stories was created by ITV SignPost – ITV’s centre of excellence for multi-platform British Sign Language services – as a resource for deaf children and their families, and for teachers of deaf children. The £1.5million initiative was delivered with some of the world’s leading publishers, as part of the company’s corporate and social responsibility plan to give deaf children access to the best children’s books in their native sign language.

The free website www.signedstories.com has grown in popularity with deaf and hearing children, children with special educational needs and those learning English as a second language – it’s now used by hundreds of thousands of children around the world, at school and in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signedstories.com|title=Welcome to Signed Stories|website=www.signedstories.com|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amsterdam red light district 24-7-2003.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|[[De Wallen]] red-light district in [[Amsterdam]]]]
'''Red-light districts''' are areas associated with the [[sex industry]] and sex-oriented businesses (e.g. [[sex shop]]s and [[strip club]]s). In some of these places [[prostitution]] may legally take place. Other [[red-light district]]s are known for their illegal prostitution scene (in countries where prostitution is illegal). In red light districts where prostitution is illegal prostitutes or clients may be arrested or fined if caught by the police (the enforcement of anti-prostitution laws varies by country or place).

Following is a partial list of well known red-light districts around the world, both current and historical.

====England====
Prostitution is not illegal when performed by a person acting alone in private, but public solicitation, brothels and pimping are. The [[Policing and Crime Act 2009]] makes it illegal to pay for sex with a prostitute who has been “subjected to force” and this is a ''[[strict liability offence]]'' (clients can be prosecuted even if they didn’t know the prostitute was forced).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2009/ukpga_20090026_en_4#pt2-pb1-l1g14 |title=Policing and Crime Act 2009 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nodo50.org/Laura_Agustin/unworkable-ways-to-stop-trafficking-uk-law-on-exploitation-and-gain |title=This won't stop trafficking: UK law on exploitation and gain |website=Nodo50.org |date=6 April 2010 |accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Longobardia''' ({{lang-el|Λογγοβαρδία}}, also variously Λογγιβαρδία, ''Longibardia'' and Λαγουβαρδία, ''Lagoubardia'') was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] term for the territories controlled by the [[Lombards]] in [[Italian peninsula|Italy]]. In the 9th-10th centuries, it was also the name of a Byzantine military-civilian province (or ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|thema]]'') known as the '''Theme of Longobardia''' located in southeastern Italy.

==History==
The term was traditionally used for the Lombard possessions, with the chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor]] distinguishing between "Great Longobardia" (Greek: Μεγάλη Λογγοβαρδία; [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''[[Langobardia Major|Longobardia major]]''), namely the [[Lombard kingdom]] in northern Italy, and "Lesser Longobardia" (Latin: ''[[Langobardia Minor|Longobardia minor]]''), which comprised southern Italy, with the Lombard duchies of [[Duchy of Benevento|Benevento]], [[Duchy of Spoleto|Spoleto]], [[Principality of Salerno|Salerno]] and [[Duchy of Capua|Capua]], the Byzantine possessions, and the city-states ([[Duchy of Naples|Naples]], [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]] and [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]]) under Byzantine suzerainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|pp=1249–1250}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pertusi181"&gt;{{harvnb|Pertusi|1952|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its strictest and most technical sense, the name referred to the province (''[[theme (Byzantine district)|thema]]'') which encompassed the modern [[Region of Italy|Italian region]] of [[Apulia]] and parts of [[Basilicata]], with [[Bari]] as its capital.&lt;ref name="ODB1250"&gt;{{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|p=1250}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its exact origin and evolution are not entirely clear.&lt;ref name="ODB1250"/&gt; After a century of almost complete absence from the affairs of the Italian peninsula, Byzantium once more began to intervene actively under [[Basil I the Macedonian]] (reigned 867–886), whose western policy aimed to clear the [[Adriatic Sea]] from [[Saracen]] raiders, re-establish Byzantine dominance over [[Dalmatia]], and extend Byzantine control once more over parts of Italy.{{sfn|Kreutz|1996|pp=41–43}} In this process, [[Otranto]] was taken from the Saracens in 873, and in 876 the Byzantines took over [[Bari]], which had been captured from its [[Emirate of Bari|Saracen rulers]] in 871 by [[Louis II of Italy]].{{sfn|Kreutz|1996|p=57}} It was probably at this juncture that the foundations of the later theme were laid, perhaps in the form of a subordinate division (''[[tourma]]'') of the ''thema'' of [[Cephallenia (theme)|Cephallenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|pp=256, 1250}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaigns of [[Nikephoros Phokas the Elder]] in the mid-880s and of his successors greatly expanded the area under Byzantine control, which came to include all of [[Calabria]], Apulia, and the Basilicata. Even [[Benevento]], the centre of [[Lombards|Lombard]] power in southern Italy, was captured in 891.{{sfn|Kreutz|1996|pp=63–66}} The first reference to Longobardia as a theme dates to precisely this time, but at first it appears that it was administered jointly with other European ''themata'' of the Byzantine Empire:&lt;ref name="ODB1250"/&gt; in 891 the first known ''[[strategos]]'' (military governor) of Longobardia, Symbatikios, was also governor of [[Macedonia (theme)|Macedonia]], [[Thrace (theme)|Thrace]] and Cephallenia, while his successor George administered Longobardia jointly with its parent ''thema'', Cephallenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pertusi|1952|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dedicated ''strategos'' solely for Longobardia is only attested from 911 on.&lt;ref name="ODB1250"/&gt; In 938 and 956, it also appears united with the ''thema'' of [[Calabria]], although the duration of this arrangement is unclear. At any rate, after c. 965, the two ''themata'' were permanently united into the new [[Catepanate of Italy]], with the [[catepan]]'s seat again at Bari.&lt;ref name="Pertusi181"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ODB1250"/&gt;

The [[Varangian Guard]] fought as part of the Byzantine army in several campaigns in the area, known to them as ''Langbardland''; in their [[Scandinavia]]n homleand, their exploits are commemorated in the [[Italy runestones]].

The '''Maestrazgo''' ({{IPA-es|maesˈtɾaðɣo|lang}}) or '''Maestrat''' ({{IPA-ca|maesˈtɾat|langva}}) is a [[natural region|natural]] and [[historical region|historical]] [[mountainous]] region, located at the eastern end of the [[Sistema Ibérico]] mountain range, in [[Spain]]. It encompasses the north of the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Autonomous Community]] of [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], in [[Castellón (province)|Castellón]] province, and parts of the east of the [[Aragon]]ese province of [[Teruel (province)|Teruel]]. The area is mountainous and sparsely populated with a rich mixture of flora and fauna.

The district was under control of [[Military order (society)|military order]]s following the 12th-century Christian reconquest of the area from the [[Moors]]. It also had a significant role in the 19th century [[Carlist Wars]] and the 20th century [[Spanish Civil War]]. After many years of decline the area is undergoing some re-vitalization, helped by funding from the [[European Union]] and tourism.

==History==
[[File:Valltorta Albocàsser.jpg|right|thumb|Cave painting at la Valltorta ravine.]]
The earliest signs of human habitation date back to the [[Pleistocene]] era, 25,000 years ago. Cave paintings have been discovered in many locations and they have been designated by [[UNESCO]] as part of the [[Rock Art of the Mediterranean Basin on the Iberian Peninsula]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;

|accessdate=2009-11-16
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Occupation by the [[Ilercavones]], a tribe of [[Iberians]], [[Ancient Rome#Empire|Roman]]s and the [[Moors]] followed, but the identity of the region was first established following the [[Reconquista]] when the area was dominated by [[Military order (society)|military order]]s. Local stories persist that a group of [[Catharism|Cathars]], led by the [[Cathar Perfect|perfectus]] [[Guillaume Bélibaste]] escaped from Carcassonne and took refuge in the Maestrazgo, living with a small community near [[Morella, Castellon|Morella]] for about ten years, before being betrayed by a spy in the service of the [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]]. Bélibaste was taken to [[Carcassonne]] and burnt at the stake there.&lt;ref name="webster01"&gt;Webster, 198-202&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Maestrazgo is derived from the word ''maestre'' (English meaning - master) as these territories were historically under the jurisdiction of the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Masters]] of the military orders of the [[Knights Templar]], [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|St John of Malta]] and [[Order of Montesa|Montesa]].&lt;ref name=mancomunidad-turisto&gt;

|accessdate=2009-11-16
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, during the [[Carlist Wars]], the military district of ''la Comandancia General del Maestrazgo'' was created by [[Ramón Cabrera y Griñó|Ramón Cabrera]].&lt;ref name=mancomunidad-turisto/&gt;  During the [[Spanish Civil War]] the area was intensively fought over, especially after the [[Battle of Teruel|fall of Teruel]]. [[Spanish Maquis|Republican guerillas]] of the ''Agrupación guerrillera de Levante y Aragón'' held out in the mountains of the Maestrazgo until the 1950s.&lt;ref name="webster02"&gt;Webster, 162-164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The mountains in the Maestrazgo, like the [[Serra de la Creu, Maestrat|Serra de la Creu]], [[Serra d'En Segures]], [[Talaies d'Alcalà]], [[Serra de la Vall d'Àngel]], [[Serra d'en Galceran]], [[Serra d'Esparreguera]], [[Serra de Sant Pere]], [[Serra de Vallivana]], [[Serra d'En Celler]], [[Tossal de la Barbuda]], [[Montegordo]], the [[Cervera Mountains]], [[Serra del Turmell]], [[Serra de l'Espadella]], [[Moles de Xert]] and the [[Benifassà Mountains]], form the Mediterranean end of the [[Sistema Ibérico]]. The highest point is the {{convert|1831|m|ft}} high [[Penyagolosa]], located at the southern end of the region. At the base of the mountain is the important pilgrimage destination of Sant Joan de Penyagolosa.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Castellón province administrative divisions, the Maestrazgo is divided into [[Alt Maestrat]] and [[Baix Maestrat]]. The historical territory does not exactly match these boundaries including also parts of [[Alcalatén]] and [[Plana Alta]]. In [[Aragon]], [[Teruel Province]] there is a [[comarca]] officially called [[Maestrazgo, Aragon|Maestrazgo]] since 1999, but historically locations in other districts were also part of the Maestrazgo. The region has formed a Mancomunidad, a free association for cooperative purposes, between fifty five municipalities.&lt;ref name=mancomunidad-turisto/&gt; Major settlements include [[Vilafranca]], [[Cantavieja]], [[Morella, Castellon|Morella]] and [[Alcañiz]].

The Maestrazgo Cultural Park has been established to protect the regional culture and landscape. The area lies between altitudes of {{convert|480|m|ft}} to {{convert|1997|m|ft}} and is drained by the [[Guadalope]] and [[Turia (river)|Turia]] rivers.&lt;ref&gt;

|publisher=European Geoparks Network
|accessdate=2009-11-16
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
The Maestrazgo supports a diverse section of plants and trees including [[thyme]], [[rosemary]], [[lavender]], [[Lamiaceae|mint]], [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]], [[Sideritis|mountain tea]], [[chamomile]], [[Truffle|black truffles]], [[Populus|poplar]]s, [[elm]]s, [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash]], [[beech]], [[Quercus ilex|holm oak]]s and [[European black pine|black pine]].&lt;ref name=mancomunidad-turisto/&gt;&lt;ref name=webster03&gt;Webster, 327-342&lt;/ref&gt;

Fauna includes [[Spanish ibex|ibex]], [[Mouflon|muflón]], [[wildcat]]s, [[otter]]s, [[European pine marten|pine marten]]s, [[fox]]es, [[Common genet|genets]], [[Northern goshawk|goshawk]]s, [[Bonelli's eagle]]s, [[Eurasian sparrowhawk|sparrowhawk]]s, [[owl]]s, [[vulture]]s, and game and fish such as [[partridge]]s, [[quail]]s, [[hare]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[wild boar]], [[trout]], and [[catfish]].&lt;ref name=mancomunidad-turisto/&gt;

==Today==
Tourism has in recent years brought a halt to economic decline in the region and the injection of [[European Union]] funding has led to the development of heritage centres and cooperatives providing training in practical crafts.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts have been made to halt de-population by attracting immigrants from [[South America]] and [[Romania]].

In 2008 [[Paleontology|palaeontologist]]s discovered an intact specimen of a previously unknown species of [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] [[dinosaur]] at a site near Morella. The animal was believed to have lived in the early [[Cretaceous]] period, approximately 120 million years ago.

'''Mousa Ali''' ({{lang-ar|موسى علي}}) is a {{Convert|2021|m|ft|0|}} [[stratovolcano]] located on the [[tri-point]] of [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]] and [[Djibouti]]. The volcano is the highest point in Djibouti. The volcano's summit is truncated by a [[caldera]], which contains [[rhyolitic]] [[lava dome]]s and [[lava flow]]s.&lt;ref name=gvp/&gt; The last known eruption occurred before the [[Holocene]] era.

Mousa Ali is situated at the tri-point of the [[Tadjourah Region]] of [[Djibouti]], the [[Southern Red Sea Region]] of [[Eritrea]], and the [[Afar Region]] of [[Ethiopia]].

==Geography ==
[[File:Mousa Ali Relief Map.png|thumb|left|Mousa Ali relief map.]]
The mountain has two distinct summits, the higher being the south one with an elevation of 2,021 metres The north summit in Ethiopia has an elevation of 1,871 metres. Both summits are separated by a large caldera, about 1&amp;nbsp;km (0.71&amp;nbsp;mi) wide and 1514 metres deep. Mousa Ali, in the northern part of the [[Great Rift Valley]] region, has Eritrea on its northern flank, Ethiopia on the west, and Djibouti the east and south. The Djiboutian town of [[Dorra]] is 36&amp;nbsp;km to the south-southeast, the Ethiopian volcano Manda-Inakir is 22&amp;nbsp;km to the southwest, and the road from the Ethiopian town of Manda to the Eritrean port of [[Assab]] is 19&amp;nbsp;km to the northwest.

==Wildlife and flora==
The mountain is home to an abundant amount of wildlife, lush vegetation, flowering shrubs and trees and various plants.

==History==
Two sects of [[Afar people|Afar]] live in the area. They are collectively known as Adrúmmi, from 'Adó rum li or "white as Byzantines."
The position of Ali Mousa as the tripoint between [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]] and [[Djibouti]] is not the result of an agreement between the three countries.  In December 1948 the British administering Eritrea refused to attend a meeting with the other two parties to determine the exact location of their tripoint, set in a 1908 treaty as 60&amp;nbsp;km inland from the Red Sea.  British administration of Eritrea ended in 1952, and with increasing Ethiopian administration over the ensuing decade, and incorporation into Ethiopia from 1962 to 1993, the boundary was internal, not international.  In 2002, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission established the tri-point at the Mousa Ali summit;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Climate==
The temperature of Mousa Ali usually ranges from 7&amp;nbsp;°C to 19&amp;nbsp;°C in December and January, and 14&amp;nbsp;°C to 29&amp;nbsp;°C from June to September. 
The weather on the mountain can be very erratic, sometimes severe.

The '''Pan-African Ocean''' is a hypothesized paleo-ocean whose closure created the [[supercontinent]] of [[Pannotia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linnemann|first=Ulf |author2=R.

The ocean closed before the beginning of the [[Phanerozoic]] Eon, when the [[Panthalassa]] ocean expanded, and was eventually replaced by it.

[[File:Periplous of the Erythraean Sea.svg|thumb|450x450px|Names, routes and locations of the ''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'']]
The '''''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea''''' or '''''Periplus of the Red Sea''''' ({{lang-grc-koi|Περίπλους τῆς Ἐρυθράς Θαλάσσης}}, {{lang-la|Periplus Maris Erythraei}}) is a [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] [[periplus]] written in [[Koine Greek]] that describes navigation and [[Roman commerce|trading opportunities]] from [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egyptian]] ports like [[Berenice Troglodytica]] along the coast of the [[Red Sea]], and others along [[Horn of Africa]], the [[Sindh]] region of [[Pakistan]], along with southwestern regions of [[India]]. The text has been ascribed to different dates between the first and third centuries CE, but a mid-first century date is now the most commonly accepted. While the author is unknown, it is clearly a firsthand description by someone familiar with the area and is nearly unique in providing accurate insights into what the ancient European world knew about the lands around the [[Indian Ocean]].

The ''Erythraean Sea'', or in modern spelling, ''Eritrean Sea'' ({{lang-el|Ἐρυθρά Θάλασσα}}) is presently a Greek name for the Red Sea; to the ancient Greeks it included the Indian Ocean in its entirety and the [[Persian Gulf]].

==Synopsis==
[[File:PeriplusAncientMap.jpg|thumb|200px|17th century map depicting the locations of the ''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea''.]]
The work consists of 66 chapters, most of them about the length of a long paragraph in English.  For instance, the short Chapter 9 reads in its entirety:
{{quote|From Malao ([[Berbera]]) it is two courses to the mart of Moundou, where ships anchor more safely by an island lying very close to the land.  The imports to this are as aforesaid [Chapter 8 mentions iron, gold, silver, drinking cups, etc.], and from it likewise are exported the same goods [Chapter 8 mentions myrrh, douaka, makeir, and slaves], and fragrant gum called ''mokrotou'' (cf. [[Sanskrit]] makaranda). The inhabitants who trade here are more stubborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hakluyt Society|title=The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea|date=1980|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpoN9PDYKC4C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=mokrotou&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0r_57MpUJq&amp;sig=vO3j8SnB-6poMNHh2cMs3VF7mHc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBpJ3ar-nWAhUiMJoKHcIIAhMQ6AEIODAC#v=onepage&amp;q=mokrotou&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In many cases, the description of places is sufficiently accurate to identify their present locations; for others, there is considerable debate.  For instance, a "[[Rhapta]]" is mentioned as the farthest market down the African coast of "[[Azania]]", but there are at least five locations matching the description, ranging from [[Tanga, Tanzania|Tanga]] to south of the [[Rufiji River]] delta.  The description of the Indian coast mentions the [[Ganges River]] clearly, yet after that is somewhat garbled, describing China as a "[[Names of China#Sin|great inland city Thina]]" that is a source of raw [[silk]].

The ''Periplus'' says that a direct sailing route from the Red Sea to the Indian peninsula across the open ocean was discovered by [[Hippalus]] (1st century BCE).

Many trade goods are mentioned in the ''Periplus'', but some of the words naming trade goods are seen nowhere else in ancient literature, and so we can only guess as to what they might be. For example, one trade good mentioned is ''"lakkos chromatinos"''. The name ''lakkos'' appears nowhere else in ancient Greek or Roman literature. The name re-surfaces in late medieval Latin as ''lacca'', borrowed from medieval Arabic ''lakk'' in turn borrowed from Sanskritic ''lakh'', meaning [[lac]] i.e. a red-colored resin native to India used as a lacquer and used also as a red colorant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/sinoiranicachine00laufrich#page/476/mode/1up ''Sino-Iranica''] by Berthold Laufer, year 1919, page 476, footnote 9. Also [https://archive.org/stream/hobsonjobsonglos00yulerich#page/499/mode/1up ''A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases''], by Yule and Burnell, year 1903, page 499.&lt;/ref&gt; Some other named trade goods remain obscure.

The ''Periplus'' text derives from a Byzantine 10th-century manuscript in minuscule hand, contained in the collections of the [[University Library Heidelberg]] (CPG 398: 40v-54v), and a copy of it dating from the 14th or 15th century in the British Museum (B.M. Add 19391 9r-12r). In the 10th-century manuscript, the text is attributed to [[Arrian]], probably for no deeper reason than that the manuscript was adjacent to the ''[[Periplus Ponti Euxini]]'' written by him. The ''Periplus'' was edited by [[Sigmund Gelen]] (Zikmund Hruby z Jeleni of [[Prague]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vialibri.net/552display/year_1532_1.html "viaLibri Resources for Bibliophiles"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130222104527/http://www.vialibri.net/552display/year_1532_1.html |date=2013-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and first published in a modern edition by [[Hieronymus Froben]] in 1533. This edition was corrupt and full of errors but served for later editions for three centuries until the rediscovery of the 10th century [[Heidelberg]] manuscript which was taken to Rome during the [[Thirty Years War]] (1618–1648), then to Paris under [[Napoleon]], and finally returned to Heidelberg in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Schoff (1912), pp. 7, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date and authorship==
One historical analysis, published by [[Wilfred Harvey Schoff|Schoff]] in 1912, narrowed the date of the text to 59-62 CE,&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilfred Harvey Schoff|Schoff]] (1912) "Date and Authorship of the Periplus," pages 7-15.&lt;/ref&gt; in agreement with present-day estimates of the middle of the 1st century CE.{{cn|date=December 2016}} Schoff additionally provides an historical analysis as to the text's original authorship,&lt;ref&gt;Schoff (1912), pages 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; and arrives at the conclusion that the author was a "[[Greeks|Greek]] in [[Egypt]], a [[History of Roman Egypt|Roman subject]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilfred Harvey Schoff|Schoff]] (1912) "Introduction," page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; By Schoff's calculations, this would have been during the time of [[Tiberius Claudius Balbilus]] (who coincidentally also was an [[Egypt]]ian [[Greeks|Greek]]).

John Hill maintains that the "Periplus can now be confidently dated to between 40 and 70 AD and, probably, between AD 40 and 50."&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2009), pp. xvi and 244-245, n. 10.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schoff continues by noting that the author could not have been "a highly educated man" as "is evident from his frequent confusion of [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] words and his clumsy and sometimes ungrammatical constructions."&lt;ref name="Schoff 1912, page 16"&gt;Schoff (1912), page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of "the absence of any account of the journey up the [[Nile]] and [[Wadi Hammamat|across the desert]] from [[Coptos]],"&lt;ref name="Schoff 1912, page 16"&gt;Schoff (1912), page 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Schoff prefers to pinpoint the author's residence to "Berenice rather than [[Alexandria]]."&lt;ref name="Schoff 1912, page 16"&gt;Schoff (1912), page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though Schoff is unclear about which of [[Berenice (disambiguation)|several Berenices]] he is referring to, it is actually [[Berenice Troglodytica]] which is documented, discussed at length and vividly described within the periplus text itself.&lt;ref&gt;Please refer to [[Berenice Troglodytica]].&lt;/ref&gt;

One peculiarity noted by Schoff while translating from the original [[Greek language|Greek]] version is that "the text is so vague and uncertain that [the author] seems rather to be quoting from someone else, unless indeed much of this part of the work has been lost in copying."&lt;ref name="Schoff 1912, page 16"/&gt;

[[File:SouthArabianCoin1stCenturyCE.jpg|thumb|Coin of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]], southern coast of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], in which stopped ships between Egypt and India passed. This is an imitation of a coin of [[Augustus]]. First Century CE.]]
Ships from [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyar]] regularly traveled the East African coast. The ''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'' describes the trading empire of Himyar and [[Sabaeans|Saba]], regrouped under a single ruler, "Charibael" (Karab Il Watar Yuhan'em II), who is said to have been on friendly terms with [[Rome]]:

{{quote|23. And after nine days more there is Saphar, the metropolis, in which lives Charibael, lawful king of two tribes, the [[Homerites]] and those living next to them, called the Sabaites; through continual embassies and gifts, he is a friend of the Emperors.|Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, Paragraph 23.&lt;ref name="sourcebook" /&gt;}}

===Frankincense kingdom===
The Frankincense kingdom is described further east along the southern coast of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], with the harbour of Cana (South Arabic ''Qana'', modern [[Bir Ali]] in [[Hadramaut]]). The ruler of this kingdom is named [[Eleazus]], or Eleazar, thought to correspond to King Iliazz Yalit I:

{{quote|27. After Eudaemon Arabia there is a continuous length of coast, and a bay extending two thousand stadia or more, along which there are Nomads and Fish-Eaters living in villages; just beyond the cape projecting from this bay there is another market-town by the shore, Cana, of the Kingdom of Eleazus, the Frankincense Country; and facing it there are two desert islands, one called Island of Birds, the other Dome Island, one hundred and twenty stadia from Cana. Inland from this place lies the metropolis Sabbatha, in which the King lives. All the frankincense produced in the country is brought by camels to that place to be stored, and to Cana on rafts held up by inflated skins after the manner of the country, and in boats. And this place has a trade also with the far-side ports, with [[Barygaza]] and [[Scythia]] and [[Ommana]] and the neighboring coast of [[Persia]].|Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, Chap 27}}

[[Ancient Egypt]]ian, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Persian Gulf]] pottery has been recovered from the site by an [[archaeology|archaeological]] team from the [[University of Michigan]]. Opone is in the thirteenth entry of the ''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'', which in part states:

{{quote|And then, after sailing four hundred [[Ancient Greek weights and measures|stadia]] along a promontory, toward which place the [[ocean current|current]] also draws you, there is another market-town called Opone, into which the same things are imported as those already mentioned, and in it the greatest quantity of [[cinnamon]] is produced, (the arebo and moto), and [[slavery|slave]]s of the better sort, which are brought to Egypt in increasing numbers; and a great quantity of [[tortoiseshell material|tortoiseshell]], better than that found elsewhere.|Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, Chap.13&lt;ref name="sourcebook"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/periplus.html Full text, Schoff's 1912 translation]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ancient times, Opone operated as a port of call for merchants from [[Phoenicia]], [[Egypt]], [[Greece]], [[Persia]], [[Yemen]], [[Nabataea]], [[Azania]], the [[Roman Empire]] and elsewhere, as it possessed a strategic location along the coastal route from Azania to the [[Red Sea]]. Merchants from as far afield as [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] passed through Opone, trading spices, silks and other goods, before departing south for [[Jubaland|Azania]] or north to [[Yemen]] or [[Egypt]] on the [[trade route]]s that spanned the length of the [[Indian Ocean]]'s rim. As early as 50 CE, Opone was well known as a center for the cinnamon trade, along with the trading of [[clove]]s and other [[spice]]s, [[ivory]], exotic animal skins and [[incense]].

====Malao====
{{Main|Malao (ancient)}}
The ancient port city of [[Malao (ancient)|Malao]], situated in present-day [[Berbera]] in northwestern Somalia, is also mentioned in the Periplus:

{{quote|After Avalites there is another market-town, better than this, called Malao, distant a sail of about eight hundred stadia. The anchorage is an open roadstead, sheltered by a spit running out from the east. Here the natives are more peaceable. There are imported into this place the things already mentioned, and many tunics, cloaks from Arsinoe, dressed and dyed; drinking-cups, sheets of soft copper in small quantity, iron, and gold and silver coin, not much. There are exported from these places myrrh, a little frankincense, (that known as far-side), the harder cinnamon, duaca, Indian copal and macir, which are imported into Arabia; and slaves, but rarely.|Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, Chap.8&lt;ref name="sourcebook" /&gt;}}

Aksum is mentioned in the ''Periplus'' as an important market place for ivory, which was exported throughout the ancient world:

{{quote|From that place to the city of the people called Auxumites there is a five days' journey more; to that place all the ivory is brought from the country beyond the Nile through the district called Cyeneum, and thence to Adulis.|Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, Chap.4}}

According to the ''Periplus'', the ruler of Aksum in the 1st century CE was [[Zoscales]], who, besides ruling in Aksum also held under his sway two harbours on the [[Red Sea]]: [[Adulis]] (near [[Massawa]]) and Avalites ([[Assab]]). He is also said to have been familiar with Greek literature:

{{quote|These places, from the Calf-Eaters to the other Berber country, are governed by Zoscales; who is miserly in his ways and always striving for more, but otherwise upright, and acquainted with Greek literature.|Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, Chap.5&lt;ref name="sourcebook" /&gt;}}

Recent research by the [[Tanzania]]n archaeologist Felix Chami has uncovered extensive remains of Roman trade items near the mouth of the [[Rufiji River]] and the nearby [[Mafia Island|Mafia island]], and makes a strong case that the ancient port of [[Rhapta]] was situated on the banks of the Rufiji River just south of [[Dar es Salaam]].

The ''Periplus'' informs us that:

{{quote|1=Two runs beyond this island [Menuthias = [[Zanzibar]]?] comes the very last port of trade on the coast of Azania, called [[Rhapta]] ["sewn"], a name derived from the aforementioned sewn boats, where there are great quantities of ivory and tortoise shell.&lt;ref name="Casson 1989, p. 61"&gt;Casson (1989), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chami summarizes the evidence for Rhapta's location as follows:

{{quote|The actual location of the Azanian capital, Rhapta, remains unknown. However, archaeological indicators reported above suggest that it was located on the coast of Tanzania, in the region of the Rufiji River and Mafia Island. It is in this region where the concentration of Panchaea/Azanian period settlements has been discovered. If the island of Menuthias mentioned in the Periplus was [[Zanzibar]], a short voyage south would land one in the Rufiji region.

The 2nd century geographer, Ptolemy, locates Rhapta at latitude 8° south, which is the exact latitude of the Rufiji Delta and Mafia Island. The metropolis was on the mainland about one degree west of the coast near a large river and a bay with the same name. While the river should be regarded as the modern Rufiji River, the bay should definitely be identified with the calm waters between the island of Mafia and the Rufiji area. The peninsula east of Rhapta would have been the northern tip of Mafia Island. The southern part of the bay is protected from the deep sea by numerous deltaic small islets separated from Mafia Island by shallow and narrow channels. To the north the bay is open to the sea and any sailor entering the waters from that direction would feel as if he were entering a bay. Even today the residents identify these waters as a bay, referring to it as a 'female sea', as opposed to the more violent open sea on the other side of the island of Mafia.&lt;ref&gt;Chami (2002), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In recent years, Felix Chami has found archaeological evidence for extensive Roman trade on Mafia Island and, not far away, on the mainland, near the mouth of the Rufiji River, which he dated to the first few centuries CE. Furthermore, J. Innes Miller points out that Roman coins have been found on [[Pemba Island|Pemba]] island, just north of Rhapta.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. Innes. 1969. Chapter 8: "The Cinnamon Route". In: The Spice Trade of the Roman Empire. Oxford: University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-814264-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Carl Peters has argued that Rhapta was near modern-day Quelimane in Mozambique,&lt;ref&gt;Peters, C., 1902. "The Eldorado of the Ancients", pages 312–319, 347. London: Pearson and Bell&lt;/ref&gt; citing the fact that (according to the ''Periplus'') the coastline there ran down towards the southwest. Peters also suggests that the description of the "Pyralaoi" (i.e., the "Fire people") – "situated at the entry to the [Mozambique] Channel" – indicates that they were the inhabitants of the volcanic Comoro Islands. He also maintains that Menuthias (with its abundance of rivers and crocodiles) cannot have been Zanzibar; i.e., Madagascar seems more likely.

The ''Periplus'' informs us that Rhapta, was under the firm control of a governor appointed by [[Arab]]ian king of Musa, taxes were collected, and it was serviced by "merchant craft that they staff mostly with Arab skippers and agents who, through continual intercourse and intermarriage, are familiar with the area and its language".&lt;ref name="Casson 1989, p. 61"/&gt;

The Periplus explicitly states that Azania (which included Rhapta) was subject to Charibaêl, the king of both the [[Sabaean]]s and Homerites in the southwest corner of Arabia. The kingdom is known to have been a Roman ally at this period. Charibaêl is stated in the Periplus to be "a friend of the (Roman) emperors, thanks to continuous embassies and gifts" and, therefore, Azania could fairly be described as a vassal or dependency of Rome, just as Zesan is described in the 3rd-century Chinese history, the ''[[Weilüe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;William H.

Trade with the Indian harbour of [[Barygaza]] is described extensively in the ''Periplus''. [[Nahapana]], ruler of the [[Indo-Scythian]] [[Western Satraps]] is mentioned under the name ''Nambanus'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://igmlnet.uohyd.ernet.in:8000/gw_44_5/hi-res/hcu_images/G2.pdf "History of the Andhras"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313210732/http://igmlnet.uohyd.ernet.in:8000/gw_44_5/hi-res/hcu_images/G2.pdf |date=2007-03-13 }} by Durga Prasad&lt;/ref&gt; as ruler of the area around [[Barigaza]]:

It is a fertile country, yielding wheat and rice and sesame oil and clarified butter, cotton and the Indian cloths made therefrom, of the coarser sorts. Very many cattle are pastured there, and the men are of great stature and black in color. The metropolis of this country is [[Minnagara]], from which much cotton cloth is brought down to Barygaza.|Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, Chap. 41&lt;ref name="sourcebook" /&gt;}}

Under the Western Satraps, Barigaza was one of the main centers of [[Indo-Roman trade relations|Roman trade in the subcontinent]]. The ''Periplus'' describes the many goods exchanged:

{{quote|49. There are imported into this market-town (Barigaza), wine, Italian preferred, also [[Laodicea ad Mare|Laodicea]]n and [[Arabia]]n; copper, tin, and lead; coral and topaz; thin clothing and inferior sorts of all kinds; bright-colored girdles a cubit wide; storax, sweet clover, flint glass, [[realgar]], [[antimony]], gold and silver coin, on which there is a profit when exchanged for the money of the country; and ointment, but not very costly and not much. And for the King there are brought into those places very costly vessels of silver, singing boys, beautiful maidens for the harem, fine wines, thin clothing of the finest weaves, and the choicest ointments. There are exported from these places [[spikenard]], costus {{bracket|[[Saussurea costus]]}}, [[bdellium]], ivory, agate and [[carnelian]], [[lycium]], cotton cloth of all kinds, silk cloth, mallow cloth, yarn, long pepper and such other things as are brought here from the various market-towns.

Goods were also brought down in quantity from [[Ujjain]], the capital of the Western Satraps:

{{quote|48. Inland from this place and to the east, is the city called Ozene, formerly a royal capital; from this place are brought down all things needed for the welfare of the country about Barygaza, and many things for our trade: agate and carnelian, Indian muslins and mallow cloth, and much ordinary cloth.|Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, Chapter 48.&lt;ref name="sourcebook2" /&gt;}}

The lost port city of [[Muziris]] (Near present day [[Cochin]]) in the [[Chera Dynasty|Chera kingdom]], as well as the [[Early Pandyan Kingdom]] are mentioned in the ''Periplus'' as major centers of trade, pepper and other spices, metal work and [[semiprecious]] stones, between [[Damirica]] and the [[Roman Empire]].

According to the ''Periplus'', numerous Greek seamen managed an intense trade with Muziris:
{{quote|Then come Naura ([[Kannur]]) and [[Tyndis]], the first markets of [[Damirica]] or Limyrike, and then Muziris and Nelcynda, which are now of leading importance. [[Tyndis]] is of the [[Chera dynasty|Kingdom of Cerobothra]]; it is a village in plain sight by the sea. Muziris, of the same kingdom, abounds in ships sent there with cargoes from [[Arabia]], and by the [[Greeks|Greek]]s; it is located on a river (River [[Kaveri River|Periyar]]), distant from Tyndis by river and sea five hundred stadia, and up the river from the shore twenty stadia. Nelcynda is distant from Muziris by river and sea about five hundred stadia, and is of another Kingdom, [[Early Pandyan Kingdom|the Pandian]]. This place also is situated on a river, about one hundred and twenty stadia from the sea&amp;nbsp;...|The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, 53–54}}

Damirica or Limyrike is [[Ancient Tamil country|Tamilagam]] (Tamil தமிழகம்) – the "[[Ancient Tamil country|Tamil country]]". Further, this area served as a hub for trade with the interior, in the Gangetic plain:
{{quote|Besides this there are ex-ported great quantities of fine pearls, ivory, silk cloth, spikenard from the Ganges, malabathrum from the places in the interior, transparent stones of all kinds, diamonds and sapphires, and tortoise-shell; that from Chryse Island, and that taken among the islands along the coast of Damirica (Limyrike). They make the voyage to this place in a favorable season who set out from Egypt about the month of July, that is Epiphi.|The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, 56}}

===Indo-Tibet Border===
The ''Periplus'' also describes the annual fair in present-day Northeast India, on the border with Tibet.
{{quote|Every year there turns up at the border of Thina a certain tribe, short in body and very flat-faced&amp;nbsp;... called Sêsatai&amp;nbsp;... They come with their wives and children bearing great packs resembling mats of green leaves and then remain at some spot on the border between them and those on the Thina side, and they hold a festival for several days, spreading out the mats under them, and then take off for their own homes in the interior.|Periplus, Chap. 65&lt;ref name="cassontext"&gt;{{harv|Casson|1989|pp=51–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sêsatai&lt;ref&gt;''Besatae'' in the Schoff translation and also sometimes used by Ptolemy, they are a people similar to Kirradai and they lived in the region between "Assam and Sichuan" {{harv|Casson|1989|pp=241–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are the source of ''[[malabathron]]''.
{{quote|The [? locals], counting on this, then turn up in the area, collect what the Sêsatai had spread out, extract the fibers from the reeds, which are called ''petroi'', and lightly doubling over the leaves and rolling them into ball-like  shapes, they string them on the fibers from the reeds. There are three grades: what is called big-ball malabathron from the bigger leaves; medium-ball from the lesser leaves; and small-ball from the smaller.

===Remains of the Indo-Greek kingdom===
[[File:MenanderAndReverse.JPG|thumb|The ''Periplus'' explains that coins of the [[Indo-Greek]] king [[Menander I]] were current in Barigaza.]]
The ''Periplus'' claims that Greek buildings and wells exist in [[Bharuch|Barigaza]], falsely attributing them to [[Alexander the Great]], who never went this far south. This account of a kingdom tracing its beginnings to Alexander's campaigns and the Hellenistic [[Seleucid empire]] that followed:
{{quote|The metropolis of this country is Minnagara, from which much cotton cloth is brought down to Barygaza. In these places there remain even to the present time signs of the expedition of Alexander, such as ancient shrines, walls of forts and great wells.|Periplus, Chap. 41}}

The ''Periplus'' further claims to the circulation of Indo-Greek coinage in the region:
{{quote|To the present day ancient drachmae are current in Barygaza, coming from this country, bearing inscriptions in Greek letters, and the devices of those who reigned after Alexander, [[Apollodotus II|Apollodorus]] {{sic}} and [[Menander I|Menander]].|Periplus Chap. 47&lt;ref name="sourcebook" /&gt;}}

The Greek city of [[Alexandria Bucephalous]] on the [[Jhelum River]] is mentioned in the ''Periplus'', as well as in the Roman [[Peutinger Table]]:

{{quote|The country inland of [[Barigaza]] is inhabited by numerous tribes, such as the Arattii, the Arachosii, the Gandaraei and the people of Poclais, in which is Bucephalus Alexandria|Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, 47&lt;ref name="sourcebook" /&gt;}}

'''Philippi Glacier''' ({{lang-de|Philippigletscher}}) is coastal [[glacier]] about 15&amp;nbsp;mi long, flowing N to the E end of the [[West Ice Shelf]], 15&amp;nbsp;mi W of [[Gaussberg]].  Delineated from aerial photographs taken by U.S. Navy (USN) [[OpHjp]], 1946-47.  Named by the ANCA for [[Emil Philippi]], geologist with the German Antarctic Expedition (GerAE) under [[Erich von Drygalski]], 1901–03, who made scientific observations in the vicinity of Gaussberg.

[[File:Venedig-in-Wien-Lageplan.jpg|thumb|250px|Plot plan]]
A '''plot plan''' is an architecture, [[engineering]], and/or [[landscape architecture]] [[Plan (drawing)|plan]] drawing—diagram which shows the [[buildings]], utility runs, and equipment layout, the position of [[roads]],  and other constructions of an existing or proposed project site at a defined scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tutorial Guide to AutoCAD|last=Lockhart|first=Shawna|publisher=SDC|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plot plans are also known more commonly as [[site plan]]s. The plot plan is a 'top-down' orientation.

The specific objects and relations shown are dependent on the purpose for creating the plot plan, but typically contain: retained and proposed  buildings, landscape elements, above ground features and obstructions, major infrastructure routes, and critical legal considerations such as property boundaries, setbacks, and rights of way.

Specific design disciplines' plot plans can be part of a complex project's documents, such as grading, landscape, foundation engineering, and utilities (e.g. in architecture, a plot plan drawing shows all the major features and structures on a piece of property like: buildings, porches, decks, sheds, swimming pool, etc.).

'''Sigerdis''' is a name given by the ancient Greeks to a part of the northwestern [[South Asia]]. It seems to correspond to the ''Sindhu'', the delta of the [[Indus]] river, today's area of [[Sindh]] in southern [[Pakistan]].

Referring to the conquests of the Indo-Greeks in the 2nd century BCE, [[Strabo]] writes that:

:"The Greeks... took possession, not only of [[Patalene|Patalena]], but also, on the rest of the coast, of what is called the kingdom of [[Saraostus]] and '''Sigerdis'''. In short, Apollodorus says that Bactriana is the ornament of Ariana as a whole; and, more than that, they extended their empire even as far as the [[Seres]] and the [[Phryni]]." (Strabo 11.11.1 {{ref|Strabo}})

'''Söderort''' (literally "the southern place", sometimes translated to ''South Stockholm'') is the southern suburban part of the [[Stockholm Municipality]], [[Sweden]]. It is also part of the city of [[Stockholm]]. 

== Geography ==
Söderort is located in the northern part of the [[Södertörn]] peninsula/island. The boroughs of Söderort are: [[Enskede-Årsta-Vantör]], [[Farsta (borough)|Farsta]], [[Hägersten-Liljeholmen]], [[Skärholmen (borough)|Skärholmen]], [[Skarpnäck (borough)|Skarpnäck]] and [[Älvsjö (borough)|Älvsjö]].

== History ==
The main part of Söderort was annexed by the ''City of Stockholm'' in 1913.

Since 2007, Söderort is organized into six ''stadsdelsområden'' (sometimes translated to [[Boroughs of Stockholm|boroughs]]): [[Enskede-Årsta-Vantör]], [[Farsta]], [[Hägersten-Liljeholmen]], [[Skarpnäck (borough)|Skarpnäck]], [[Skärholmen]], and [[Älvsjö]].&lt;ref name="bydistricts"&gt;City of Stockholm: [http://stockholm.se/-/English/Stockholm-by-districts/ "Stockholm by districts"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2007, it was organized into eight ''stadsdelsområden'': [[Enskede-Årsta]], [[Farsta (borough)|Farsta]], [[Hägersten (borough)|Hägersten]], [[Liljeholmen (borough)|Liljeholmen]], [[Skarpnäck (borough)|Skarpnäck]], [[Skärholmen (borough)|Skärholmen]], [[Vantör (borough)|Vantör]] and [[Älvsjö (borough)|Älvsjö]].

'''Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2''', also known as '''Old Brass Brains''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The fall of 'Old Brass Brains'|journal=Product Engineering|date=1970|volume=41|issue=1-6|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a special-purpose mechanical [[analog computer]] that uses [[gear]]s, [[pulley]]s, [[chain]]s, and other mechanical components to compute the height and time of high and low [[tide]]s for specific locations. The machine can perform tide calculations much faster than a person could do with pencil and paper. The [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]] put the machine into operation in 1910. It was used until 1965, when it was replaced by an [[Electronic computers|electronic computer]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/noaa_documents/NOAA_historic_documents/NOAA_historical_brochures/Ocean/Old_brass_brains_1989.pdf|title=Old Brass Brains|last=|first=|date=February 1989|website=|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|access-date=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early U.S. tide-prediction efforts ==
Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of gravitational forces exerted by the [[Moon]], [[Sun]], and [[Earth's rotation|rotation of the Earth]]. In 1867 the United States Coast Survey started printing annual tide tables to support safe and effective maritime, coastal, and defense activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hicks|first=Steacy|date=1967|title=The Tide Prediction Centenary of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey|url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/ihr/article/download/24009/27794|journal=International Hydrographic Review|volume=XLIV|page=|pages=121–131|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before long, these tables showed the times and heights of high and low tides to the nearest minute and tenth of a foot, respectively. Tables were printed for a year at a time and distributed prior to the start of the year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Claudy|first=C. H.|date=March 7, 1914|title=A Great Brass Brain: A Unique Engine, on the Accuracy of Which Depend Millions of Dollars and Thousands of Lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=isoxAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=%22tide%20predicting%20machine%20number%202%22%20usage&amp;pg=PA197#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tide%20predicting%20machine%20number%202%22%20usage&amp;f=false|journal=Scientific American|volume=110|pages=197–198|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prediction of tides is very challenging as it depends on multiple factors–including the alignment of the Sun and Moon, the shape of the coastline, and near-shore [[bathymetry]]. [[Theory of tides|Tide theories]] attempt to account for these factors but lead to complex calculations. Originally, calculations were performed by hand, which was very labor-intensive and error-prone.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ydM3AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Tide+Predicting+Machine+No.+2&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Description of the U.S. Coast and geodetic survey tide-predicting machine, Issue 2|last=|first=|publisher=U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The burden became even larger when the United State Coast and Geodetic Survey (USCGS, the successor to the Coast Survey) started using the more accurate [[Fourier series|harmonic method]] for predictions of tides in 1884.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

To significantly reduce the work required to predict tides, in 1881 [[William Ferrel]] of the USCGS designed a tide-predicting machine. Fauth &amp; Co. Instrument Makers built Tide-Predicting Machine No. 1 and delivered it in 1882. The Survey started using the machine routinely in 1883.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=E. G.|date=May 1912|title=The Coast and Geodetic Survey Tide Predicting Machine No. 2|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1912PA.....20..269F/0000269.000.html|journal=Popular Astronomy|volume=20|issue=5|pages=269–285|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and mechanism ==
In 1895 the USCGS grew concerned because Tide-Predicting Machine No. 1 had developed considerable wear from almost constant use over 12 years. The office decided to construct a new machine that was faster, more accurate, and more reliable. This became Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Rolin Harris and E. G. Fischer of the USCGS led the effort.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The design team studied previous British and U.S. [[tide-predicting machine]]s and incorporated their best attributes in the design of the new machine.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The machine, also known as “Old Brass Brains”, used an intricate arrangement of gears, pulleys, slides, and other components. The design of the new machine was approved in 1895, and construction began in 1896.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2 was the first tide-predicting machine to incorporate both a paper graph of the tides–the approach used by earlier British machines–and dials and scales that showed the tide height and corresponding date and time–used by Tide-Predicting Machine No. 1. The dials and scales made it much easier for an operator to precisely determine the height and time of high and low tides. The paper graph, referred to as a tide curve, was very useful as a record of the computation that could be checked later to confirm the calculations were performed correctly.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A hand [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] turned by the operator provides the power for the machine’s mechanical calculations. [[Battery (electricity)|Battery]]-powered [[Electrical network|electrical circuits]] are used to mark the start of hours and days on the paper graph and to stop the machine when high and low tides were reached so the operator can note the height and time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
[[File:NOAA's Tide Predicting Machine No. 2.jpg|alt=Gears, pulleys, and other components|thumb|This photo shows the largest of the three sections of Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2. The gears on the left transmit power from the hand crank. The components on the right contribute to the computation of the time of high and low tides.]]
Much consideration was given to the mechanical characteristics of the components to ensure reliability and accuracy. For instance, some components that were hard to replace were designed with a 50-year lifetime. Also, the summation chains were moved across gears under tension for a year of work days before being installed in the machine to ensure they were sufficiently flexible and their length would remain constant.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Other work in the USCGS took precedence over construction of the new machine, and a reduction in staff levels precluded all work on the new machine for three years. As a result, Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2 was not functional until 1910.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It was first applied to predicting values for the 1912 and 1913 tide tables. Then the machine was disassembled, polished, plated, lacquered, and reassembled in time to provide predictions for the 1914 tide tables.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Comparisons of the accuracy of the mechanical predictions of tides compared to hand calculations for two challenging locations demonstrated errors in heights of {{convert|0.72|in|cm|2}} or less.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Old Brass Brains is {{convert|10.8|ft|m|1}} long, {{convert|6.2|ft|m|1}} high, {{convert|2|ft|m|1}} wide&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and weighs approximately {{convert|2500|lb|kg|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/predmach.html|title=Tide Predicting Machines - NOAA Tides &amp; Currents|website=www.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
To compute tides for a coastal location, the operator has to configure the machine for that location. This is done by adjusting physical settings on the machine based on up to 37 factors. Those factors are determined empirically by harmonic analysis of a time series of tides at the location,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and represent the influence of the moon, sun, depth of bay, offshore islands, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Once computed the factors for a location can be applied to past and future years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and are shared widely so anyone can perform tide calculations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
[[File:A Tide Formula Component Crank on Tide Predicting Machine No. 2.jpg|thumb|A tide formula component crank on Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2. The mechanical arrangement (a slotted crank yoke) converts circular motion to a vertical motion that traces a sinusoid. The operator adjusts the position of the pin on the crank to represent a component of the tide formula at a specific coastal port before starting computations. The pin position affects the amplitude and phase of the sinusoid.]]
Assuming the factors for a location are known, configuring the machine to compute tides for the location requires 2.5–4 hours. Predictions for a year’s tides at that location can then be produced in 8–15 hours.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The calculations Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2 can perform in 1 day would require a person 125 days to perform by hand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Around 1915, the machine was used to produce annual tide tables for 70 major [[port]]s worldwide.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additional ports were added in later years.

During [[World War II]] the USCGS produced annual tide tables for major ports four years in advance in case Old Brass Brains broke down or was sabotaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of the Sea: Tsunamis, Storm Surges, Rogue Waves, and Our Quest to Predict Disasters|last=Parker|first=Bruce|publisher=Macmillan|year=2012|isbn=978-0-230-12074-7|location=|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USCGS also provided tide predictions for a number of additional locations in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], including potential locations for [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious invasions]]. Obtaining tide observations for those locations to support computation of the factors required for predictions was often a significant challenge.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Around 1960 Old Brass Brains was modified to replace the hand crank with an electric motor and to add an automatic readout of heights and times.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1965, the USCGS retired the Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2, 55 years after it entered service, and started performing its tide calculations with an electronic computer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Current status ==
The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) maintains Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2 in working condition. The machine is at NOAA’s facility in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]]. The public can occasionally view the machine during events such as the NOAA Open House.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://preserveamerica.noaa.gov/hw13.html|title=NOAA Open House|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical basis ==
Tide Predicting Machine No. 2 is based on the first accurate mathematical approach for predicting tides, which was developed around 1867 by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Sir William Thomson]] (who later became Lord Kelvin) and later refined by [[George Darwin|Sir George Darwin]]. This approach, called “harmonic analysis,” approximates tide heights by a summation of cosine terms, each of which has a different [[frequency]]. The [[formula]] for sea height is represented as

: &lt;math&gt;H_0 + A_1 \cos(\omega_1 t+\varphi_1)+A_2 \cos(\omega_2 t+\varphi_2)+A_3 \cos(\omega_3 t+\varphi_3)+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

containing 10, 20 or even more [[Trigonometric functions|trigonometric]] terms. &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is the height of mean sea level. For each term &lt;math&gt;i = 1, \ldots, n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[amplitude]] of the term’s contribution to tide height above mean sea level, &lt;math&gt;\omega_i&lt;/math&gt; determines the frequency of the term, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time, and &lt;math&gt;\phi_i&lt;/math&gt; is the relative phase of the term. This is the equation computed by most tide-predicting machines, including Old Brass Brains which handles 37 such terms.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The frequencies &lt;math&gt;\omega_i&lt;/math&gt; are determined from [[Astronomy|astronomical]] considerations, which were determined by Thomson and Darwin and have been almost universally used. For instance one speed represents the speed of a theoretical moon with a uniform speed in a circular [[orbit]] in the [[Celestial equator|equatorial plane]]. Other components with their own speeds correct for the differences between the orbit of that theoretical moon and the real [[Moon]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The coefficients &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_i&lt;/math&gt; are determined by [[Fourier analysis]] of a [[time series]] of tide heights. This analysis can be performed with a record as short as two weeks but a 369-day sample is standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcarc-tidesii1|title=Fourier Analysis of Ocean Tides II|last=Phillips|first=Tony|date=|website=Feature Column: Monthly Essays on Mathematical Topics|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|access-date=May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longer sample minimizes the errors introduced by wind storms, freshets, and other non-regular influences.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Image:099-tmpshaft.jpg|thumb|mechanism for generating sinusoidal motion component]]
To compute those terms the USCGS designers incorporated the same "[[Slotted link mechanism|slotted yoke crank]]" approach for mechanically computing cosines as Thomson used, shown in the schematic (right). A rotating drive-wheel ("crank") is fitted with an off-center peg.  A shaft with a horizontally-slotted section is free to move vertically up and down. The wheel's off-center peg is located in the slot. As a result, when the peg moves around with the wheel, it makes the shaft move up and down within limits. As a result of this arrangement when the drive-wheel rotates uniformly, say clockwise, the shaft moves sinusoidally up and down. The vertical position of the center of the slot, at any time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, can then be expressed as &lt;math&gt;A_1 \cos(\omega_1 t+\phi_1)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; is the radial distance from the wheel's center to the peg, &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; is the rate at which the wheel turns (in [[radian]]s per unit of time) and is determined by gears, and &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; is the starting phase angle of the peg, measured in radians from the 12 o'clock position to the angular position where the peg was at time zero. An operator adjusted the location of each pin based on the empirically computed parameters for a port’s tides. This arrangement makes a physical analog of just one term in the tide equation. Old Brass Brains computes 37 such terms.
[[File:Slotted Yoke Cranks.jpg|thumb|The slotted yoke cranks at the top and bottom (with the triangular pieces) move vertically in a sinusoidal pattern. The locations of their pins determine their amplitudes and phases, representing factors in the tide equation. The pulleys across the center move with the attached cranks. The summation chain above and below the pulleys sums their influences.]]
The USCGS designers also adopted from the earlier British machines the approach of summing terms by passing a chain over and under pulleys attached to the vertically oscillating yokes. The amount of chain remaining after passing over and under pulleys indicated the sum of the terms. For example, a large value for a term would move its pulley further from a neutral position, deflecting the chain, and reducing the amount of excess chain remaining in system.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

One side of Old Brass Brains is used to compute the height of the tide. A similar arrangement of components on the other side, but with cranks 90 degrees out of phase, represents the derivative with respect to time of the tide height formula. When the derivative is zero the time of high or low tide has been reached. An electrical circuit detects this condition and stops the machine so the operator can record the date, time, and tide height.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The tide prediction formula implemented by the machine includes the addition of a series of cosine terms. The triangular metal pieces are part of slotted yoke cranks which convert circular motion to a vertical motion that traces a sinusoid. Each slotted yoke crank is connected by a shaft to a pulley, which causes the pulley to follow the sinusoidal motion. A chain going over and under pulleys sums each of their deflections to compute the tide. Along the top of the photo, connecting shafts drive slotted yoke cranks on both sides of the machine. One side of the machine computes the height of tides while the other determines the times of high and low tides.

The '''Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt''' ({{lang-es|Eje Volcánico Transversal}}), also known as the '''Transvolcanic Belt''' and locally as the '''{{lang|es|Sierra Nevada}}''' (''Snowy Mountain Range''),&lt;ref name=D&gt;{{cite book |last=Delgado de Cantú |first=Gloria M. |title=México, estructuras, política, económica y social |publisher=Pearson Educación |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZDTWsJGsY8C&amp;pg=PA15 |isbn=978-970-26-0357-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[volcanic belt]] that covers central-southern [[Mexico]]. Several of its highest peaks have snow all year long, and during clear weather, they are visible to a large percentage of those who live on the many high plateaus from which these volcanoes rise.

==History==
The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt spans across Central-Southern [[Mexico]] from the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] between 18°30'N and 21°30'N, resting on the southern edge of the [[North American Plate]].&lt;ref name="FOEMM"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferrari|first1=Luca|last2=Esquivel|first2=Teresa|last3=Manea|first3=Vlad|last4=Manea|first4=Marina|title=The dynamic history of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the Mexico subduction zone|journal=Tectonophysics|doi=10.1016/j.tecto.2011.09.018|volume=522-523|pages=122–149|bibcode=2012Tectp.522..122F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="F"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ferrari|first1=Luca|title=The Geochemical Puzzle of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt: Mantle Plume, Continental Rifting, or Mantle Perturbation Induced by Subduction?|url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/Mexico2.html|website=www.MantlePlumes.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt is a unique volcanic belt; it is not parallel to the Middle American Trench, and many of the main [[stratovolcano]]es are positioned obliquely to the general position of the arc. In addition to the physiographic complexities, igneous compositions vary—dominant subduction related products contrast with intraplate geo-chemical signatures.&lt;ref name="FOEMM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FMM"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manea|first1=Vlad|last2=Manea|first2=Marina|last3=Ferrari|first3=Luca|title=A geodynamical perspective on the subduction of Cocos and Rivera plates beneath Mexico and Central America|journal=Tectonophysics|date=2013|volume=609|pages=56–81|doi=10.1016/j.tecto.2012.12.039|bibcode=2013Tectp.609...56M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The many intriguing aspects of the belt has spurred several hypotheses based on a typical subduction scenario; Intra-plate [[leaky transform fault]]s, [[mantle plume]]s, continental [[rifting]], and jump of the eastward Pacific Rise.&lt;ref name="FOEMM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EA"/&gt; These features are partially related to the reactivation of early fault systems during the Trans-Mexican Volcanic belt's evolution.

Prior to the formation of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, an older, but related volcanic belt, the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] occupied the area. Resuming in the [[Eocene]], post-[[Laramide]] deformation, [[subduction]] related volcanism formed the Sierra Madre Occidental silic volcanic arc at a paleo-subduction zone off the coast of [[Baja California]], before the peninsula [[rift]]ed away.&lt;ref name="F"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FLAC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AVGFEFO"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alva-Valdivia|first1=Luis|last2=Goguitchaichvili|first2=Avto|last3=Ferrari|first3=Luca|last4=Rosas-Elguera|first4=Jose|last5=Fucugauchi|first5=Jaime|last6=Orozco|first6=Jose|title=Paleomagnetic data from the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt: implications for tectonics and volcanic stratigraphy|journal=Society of Geomagnetism and Earth, Planets, Space Sciences|date=2000|volume=52|pages=467–478|doi=10.1186/bf03351651}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
From the [[Late Eocene]] to the [[Middle Miocene]], counterclockwise rotation of the volcanic arc transitioned the once active Sierra Madre Occidental to a now active Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.&lt;ref name="F"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FLAC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferrari|first1=Luca|last2=Lopez-Martinez|first2=Margarita|last3=Aguirre-Díaz|first3=Gerardo|last4=Carrasco-Núñez|first4=Gerardo|title=Space-time patterns of Cenozoic arc volcanism in central Mexico: From the Sierra Madre Occidental to the Mexican Volcanic Belt|journal=GSA|volume=27|pages=303–306|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1999)027&lt;0303:stpoca&gt;2.3.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the Middle Miocene, the transition from the [[silicic]] to more [[mafic]] compositions was complete, and can be considered the beginning of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.&lt;ref name="F"/&gt; Due to the orthogonal orientation of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in relation to the trend of Mexican tectonic provinces, its Pre-[[Cretaceous]] [[Basement rock|basement]] is highly heterogeneous.&lt;ref name="FOEMM"/&gt;  The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt east of 101°W rests upon [[Precambrian]] terranes, assembled into the Oaxaquia [[microcontinent]] and on the [[Paleozoic]] Mixteco [[terrane]]. West of 101°W, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt resides on top of the Guerro composite terrane - a make up of [[Jurassic]] to Cretaceous marine marginal arcs, which are built on [[Triassic]] - Early Jurassic [[siliclastic]] [[turbidite]]s. Assemblage of these basement rocks results with a thickness of 50–55&amp;nbsp;km east of 101°W and 35–40&amp;nbsp;km west of 101°W.&lt;ref name="FOEMM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GZ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guzman|first1=Eduardo|last2=Zoltan|first2=Cserna|title=Tectonic History of Mexico|url=http://archives.datapages.com/data/specpubs/structu1/data/a151/a151/0001/0100/0113.htm|journal=AAPG Special Volumes|date=1963|pages=113–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plate evolution==
The subducting plates originated from the breakup of the [[Farallon Plate]] at approximately 23 Ma, which created two plates at equatorial latitudes, the Cocos Plate and southern [[Nazca Plate]]. The Rivera Plate was the last fragment detached from the Cocos Plate, becoming a microplate at around 10 Ma.&lt;ref name="FOEMM"/&gt; This small plate is bounded by the Rivera fracture zone, the [[East Pacific Rise]], the Tamayo fracture zone, and the Middle American Trench. The larger Cocos Plate is bordered by the North American Plate (NAM) and the [[Caribbean Plate]] to the northeast, the [[Pacific Plate]] to the west, and to the south by the Nazca Plate.&lt;ref name="FOEMM"/&gt;  The Cocos and Rivera are relatively young oceanic plates (25 and 10 Ma) that are subducting along the Middle American Trench at different convergence rates (Rivera = ~30&amp;nbsp;mm/yr and the Cocos = ~ 50–90&amp;nbsp;mm/yr).&lt;ref name="FMM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunch"/&gt; Commonly found subduction related rocks such as [[calc-alkaline]] rocks volumetrically occupy a majority of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt but smaller volumes of intraplate-like lavas, [[potassium]] rich rocks, and [[adakite]]s are associated with the area.&lt;ref name="FMM"/&gt;  Middle Miocene adakitic (more felsic) rocks are found furthest from the trench and along the volcanic front of the central Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt during the [[Pliocene]]-[[Quaternary]]. It has been suggested that slab melting contributed to the adakitic imprint on the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, prompted by the prolonged flat subduction of the Cocos Plate.&lt;ref name="FMM"/&gt;

==Belt evolution==

===Formation===
[[File:Volcanic Evolution of Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.pdf|thumb|530px|Volcanic Evolution and changes in composition over time. 
1) Early to Late Miocene the belt the Cocos and Rivera plate begin subduction beneath Central Mexico.&lt;ref name="FLAC"/&gt;
2) Late Miocene to Early Pliocene the slab tear begins to propagate West to East across the back northern area of the belt, allowing Asthenospheric heat in to generate the Mafic episode.&lt;ref name="LF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FPF"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferrari|first1=Luca|last2=Petrone|first2=Chiara|last3=Francalanci|first3=Lorella|title=Generation of oceanic-island basalt–type volcanism in the western Trans-Mexican volcanic belt by slab rollback, asthenosphere infiltration, and variable flux melting|journal=GSA|volume=29|pages=507–510|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(2001)029&lt;0507:gooibt&gt;2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
3)Latest Miocene - Early Pliocene was the onset of more silic volcanics generated by [[Flat Slab Subduction]] which pushed the belt further inland to the north.&lt;ref name="Bunch"/&gt; 
4)Late Pliocene to Holocene is characterized by slab rollback sending the volcanic arc trenchward to the present day position]]
* 1) From the early  to mid Miocene ~20 to 8 Ma, the initial Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt volcanic arc consisted of intermediate effusive volcanism, producing [[andesitic]] and [[dacitic]] [[Polygenetic volcanic field|polygenetic volcanoes]] extending from western [[Michoacan]] (longitude 102°W) to the Palma Sola area (longitude 98°30'). The plate boundary geometry and sub-horizontal subducting slab's thermal structure are the controlling factors for initial arc volcanism.&lt;ref name="FLAC"/&gt; Magmatism migrated away from the trench, moving northeast towards the Gulf of Mexico—giving the arc its characteristic E-W orientation, the inland push of the arc showed progressively drier melting, and eventually [[Slab (geology)|slab]] melting began to occur—suggesting flattening of the subducted slab.&lt;ref name="FOEMM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F"/&gt;  The oldest rocks of this age may be exposed near the modern volcanic front, in Central Mexico.&lt;ref name="AGL"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gómez-Tuena|first1=A|last2=Ferrari|first2=L.|last3=Orozco-Esquivel|first3=Ma.T.|title=Igneous Petrogenesis of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt,'|journal=Geological Society of America Special Paper|date=2007|volume=422|issue=Ch 5|pages=129–182|doi=10.1130/2007.2422(05)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2) A Late Miocene ~11 Ma eastward traveling pulse of mafic volcanism swept across the whole of Central [[Mexico]], north of the previously formed arc, ending ~ 3 Ma. The onset of the mafic lavas indicates lateral propagation of slab tear, prompted by the end of subduction beneath Baja California, allowing the influx of [[asthenosphere]] into the [[mantle wedge]].&lt;ref name="LF"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferrari|first1=Luca|title=Slab detachment control on mafic volcanic pulse and mantle heterogeneity in central Mexico|journal=GSA|volume=32|pages=77–80|doi=10.1130/g19887.1|bibcode=2004Geo....32...77F}}&lt;/ref&gt; This volcanism created basaltic plateaus through fissures, or less commonly, small shield volcanoes and lava cones, with diminishing lava volume eastward.&lt;ref name="FOEMM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FPF"/&gt;
* 3) West of 103°W, silicic volcanism between 7.5 and 3.0 Ma became [[Bimodal volcanism|bimodal]] (mafic-silicic) in the early Pliocene, creating large dome complexes and [[ignimbrite]]s, and marked the beginning of trenchward migration of volcanism. East of 101°W dome complexes, lava flows, and large calderas that produced significant quantities of ignimbrites (&gt;50&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of [[Dacite|dacitic]] to [[Rhyolite|rhyolitic]] composition can be found dating between 7.5 and 6 Ma. There is an absence of silicic volcanism between these regions during the whole Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt history. Since the late Miocene, silicic volcanism migrated trenchward over 200&amp;nbsp;km in the eastern sector (east of 101°W) and 100&amp;nbsp;km in the western sector (West of 103°W).&lt;ref name="FOEMM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FPF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AGL"/&gt;
* 4) Since the late Pliocene, the style and composition of volcanism in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt became more diverse. In several areas, volumetrically dominant calc-alkaline rocks are associated with modest volumes of intraplate-like lavas or other potassium rich rocks, accompanied by Quaternary rhyolitic [[peralkaline rock]]s. This modern arc consists of a frontal belt dominated by [[Flux melting|flux]] and slab melting and a rear belt characterized by the [[Igneous differentiation|differentiated]] rocks stated previously.&lt;ref name="FOEMM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FMM"/&gt; Absent since ~9 Ma, [[stratovolcano]]es began to be created in the last 1 Ma ~100&amp;nbsp;km behind the volcanic front in the Western Sector, oriented West - Northwest and East - Southeast. In the eastern sector, all stratovolcanoes are found within the volcanic front. One exception to the location of these stratovolcanoes is the [[Volcán de Colima|Colima volcanic complex]], which is positioned south of the southern tip of the Cocos and Rivera slab tear and is the largest volcanic edifice in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.&lt;ref name="FOEMM"/&gt; In addition to stratovolcanoes, monogenetic volcanic fields are also characteristic for this episode, the most prominent being the [[Michoacán–Guanajuato volcanic field]].

===Cause of flat slab subduction===
[[Flat slab subduction]] can commonly be explained by [[oceanic plateau]] subduction and a fast overriding plate. Central Mexico's flat subduction is not evident. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic belt's flat slab is confined between ~101°W and 96°W; this region may be explained by thicker [[continental crust]]. Existence of thick strong crust combined with decreasing fluid input contributed to narrowing the asthenospheric wedge, increasing viscosity and suction forces, which led to flat subduction—preventing the [[oceanic plate]] from entering the mantle.&lt;ref name="FOEMM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pérez-Campos|first1=Xyoli|last2=Kim|first2=YoungHee|last3=Huske|first3=Allen|last4=Davis|first4=Paul|last5=Clayton|first5=Robert|last6=Iglesias|first6=Arturo|last7=Pacheco|first7=Javier|last8=Singh|first8=Shri|last9=Manea|first9=Vlad|last10=Gurnis|first10=Michael|title=Horizontal subduction and truncation of the Cocos Plate beneath central Mexico|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=35|doi=10.1029/2008GL035127|bibcode=2008GeoRL..3518303P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

===Region===
From the west, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt runs from  [[Colima]] and [[Jalisco]] east through northern [[Michoacán]], southern [[Guanajuato]], southern [[Querétaro]], [[Mexico (state)|México State]], southern [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]], the [[Mexico City|Distrito Federal]], northern [[Morelos]], [[Puebla]], and [[Tlaxcala]], to central [[Veracruz]].

The [[Mexican Plateau]] lies to the north, bounded by the  [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] to the west and [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] to the east. The [[Cofre de Perote]] and [[Pico de Orizaba]] volcanoes, in Puebla and Veracruz, mark the meeting of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt with the Sierra Madre Oriental. To the south, the basin of the [[Balsas River]] lies between the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]]. This area is also a distinct physiographic province of the larger Sierra Madre System physiographic division.&lt;ref name=D/&gt;

===Peaks===
[[File:Pico de Orizaba 1 Zoom.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pico de Orizaba]]]]
The highest point, also the highest point in Mexico, is [[Pico de Orizaba]] ({{Convert|5636|m|ft}}) also known as Citlaltépetl, located at {{coord|19|01|N|97|16|W|}}. This, and several of the other high peaks, are active or dormant [[volcano]]es.

Other notable volcanoes in the range include (from west to east) [[Colima (volcano)|Nevado de Colima]] ({{Convert|4339|m|ft}}), [[Parícutin]] ({{Convert|2774|m|ft}}), [[Nevado de Toluca]] ({{Convert|4577|m|ft}}), [[Popocatépetl]] ({{Convert|5452|m|ft}}), [[Iztaccíhuatl]] ({{Convert|5286|m|ft}}), [[Matlalcueitl (volcano)|Matlalcueitl]] ({{Convert|4461|m|ft}}) [[Cofre de Perote]] ({{Convert|4282|m|ft}}) and [[Sierra Negra]], a companion of the Pico de Orizaba ({{Convert|4580|m|ft}}).&lt;ref name=D/&gt;

==Ecology==
The mountains are home to the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests]], one of the [[Mesoamerican pine-oak forests]] sub-[[ecoregion]]s.

The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt has many endemic species, including the [[Transvolcanic jay]] (''Aphelocoma ultramarina'').&lt;ref name=D/&gt;

'''Zogam''' (or '''Land of Zo People''') known as '''Chin State''',&lt;ref&gt;"Chin Hills (Approved)" {{GEOnet2|32FA8845BB2B3774E0440003BA962ED3}}, [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Lushai Hills''',&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 Fine Print|See Colonel T. H. Lewin, ''Wild Races of N.E. India'' (1870); ''Lushai Hills'' Gazetteer'' (Calcutta, 1906).}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Kuki Hills''',  lies in the northwest corner of the Mainland Southeast Asia landmass. This is the traditional homeland of the [[Zo people]] or [[Zomi]] who lived in this area before the colonial period under British rulership.

== Geography ==

=== Physical ===

Zogam is bounded in the East by Burma, North by India and in the West and South by Bangladesh. The country is made up of many hill ranges, and is known for its rich bio-diversity. Its territory, approximately {{convert|60000|sqmi|km2|disp=flip}} in size, in [[Myanmar]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]].

It does not include [[Asho]] settlements in Lower Burma and Masho settlements in the [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] (Burma). The area extends from latitude 25° 30' North in the Somra tracts facing [[Mount Saramati]], and in [[Nagaland]] across the Namtakik River and the North Cachar Hills, to about 20° 30' North Latitude. The longitudinal extension is between 92° 10' East and 94° 20' east. The North-South length of the Zoram is roughly {{convert|560|km|mi}} and East-West is generally about {{convert|190|km|mi}} wide.

The land occupied by the majority of the [[Zo people]] extends from a latitude of about 25 degrees 30 minutes North in the Somra Tracts facing Mt. Saramati, and in Nagaland across the Namtaleik River and the North Cachar Hills, to about 20 degrees 30 minutes North.

The Asho live further south of the Arakan Yomas, Irrawaddy valleys and Pegu Yomas (below Procne and Sandaway). All these areas fall between 92 degrees 10 minutes East and 94 degrees 20 minutes East. The north-south length of the Zo country is roughly
{{convert|350|mi|km|disp=flip}} and it is generally about {{convert|120|mi|km|disp=flip}} wide.

The majority of the people occupy the Indo-Burman ranges, a series of parallel mountain chains trending north-south along the India-Burma boundary. The mountain ranges are a continuation of the Naga and Patkoi hills, extending as far south as Arakan Yomas.

Fast Zogam lies in the eastern part of these mountains and is higher than the western mountains (West Zogam or Mizoram).

The highest peaks in these ranges are Ngulluvum, Innbuk. Thuamvum (Kennedy peak), Lentlang, Kharantlang, Rungtlang, and Arterawttlang (Mt. Victoria), which is the highest peak in Zo country at {{convert|3412|m|ft}}. The other peaks are in average about {{convert|2854|m|ft}} high. In West Zogam the highest peak is Phawngpui (Blue Mountain), which is {{convert|2164|m|ft}}. At the north and south ends of Zo country the land is less rugged and rises from {{convert|2000|to|4000|ft|m|disp=flip}}.

The capital of West Zogam, Aizawl, lies at {{convert|1214|m|ft}} above sea level, whereas Tiddim ([[Tedim]]), the capital of East Zogam, is at {{convert|2460|m|ft}}. The valleys between ranges are mostly v-shaped gorges, and there are very few flat areas to serve as, agricultural land. Because the elevations can vary quite extensively temperatures also vary greatly. In the valleys of the larger rivers, such as the Run or Manipur Rivers, the climate is sub-tropical.

== Climate ==

{{convert|16|km|mi}} away, however, at an elevation of {{convert|6000|ft|m|disp=flip}} and at the top of mountain ranges, the climate is rather moderate. The climate is "monsoon" and rain falls from May to October. Average rainfall for the year is between {{convert|70|and|170|in|cm|disp=flip|abbr=on}}. Average yearly rain in Aizawl is {{convert|208|cm|in}}, Lunglei {{convert|350|cm|in}}, Tedim {{convert|228|cm|in}}, and Kanpetlet {{convert|276|cm|in}}. In one year Tedim had 118 rainy days and Kanpetlet 127 days. Summer temperatures range between 17 and 29&amp;nbsp;°C, and winter temperatures are between 3 and 24&amp;nbsp;°C. Some places, like the town of Tedim, are chilly in winter and temperatures can drop below the freezing point in the night and frost form on the grass. Snow falls very rarely, and when it does the people call "the mountain has vomited".


== Culture ==

One Zo folksong delineates the area of Zogam as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
:''&amp;#8220;Penlehpi leh Kangtui minthang,
:''A tua tong Zota kual sung chi ua;
:''Khang Vaimang leh tuan a pupa
:''Tongchiamna Kangtui minthang aw&amp;#8221;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Translation:
:(The famous Penlehpi and Kangtui
:Between the two is the Zomi country
:The Southern King and our forefathers
:Made an agreement at the famous Kangtui)

This old folk song tells of the area of the Zomi ancestral homeland, for Penlehpi is a Burmese word for the [[Bay of Bengal]] and Kangtui is identified with Tuikang (Chindwin River).&lt;ref&gt;ST Hau Go, 'Our People, Our Language, and Our Culture', Rangoon University Chin Cultural and Literature Sub-Committee by the Mizo Union, Aizawl, 26 April 1947, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

Preferred book: "The Untold Story of Zomi" (T. Zokhai, 2018).

Zogam is within the land inhabited by the [[Chin State|Zo State]] in Myanmar and further the land inhabited by the Zomi in India and Bangladesh. Chinland is the founding name for the whole Zomi inhabited areas of land spread across three political and separate country/international boundaries. Lairam is another name used by the townships the Southern Chin State in Myanmar. Zogam tributary tribes who too called their land according to their own dialects. And all of them put together makes up a Greater Chinmi or Zomi(i.e. Zo People). Zogam covers
# the Whole [[Chin State]], 
# Plain chins (lower lands), 
# Some part of Bangladesh until it reaches to the Bay of Zogam (Bay of Bengal), 
# [[Mizoram]]
# [[Manipur]] (Churachanpur).
Therefore, Zogam is an indigenous identity of the Chin peoples together with the Kukis (Thado), Lushai (Lusei or [[Mizo people|Mizo]]), Pawi, Khalkha, Phalam and all Chinmi. Chinland (Zoram) thus equals to all the lands inhabited by these hill tribes collectively known as Chin people (Zomi), and they comprise the Laimi, Tedimmi, Mara, Khumi, Zophei, Senthang, Lautu, Zotung, Manipur, Thado, the [[Zou people|Zou]], Simte, Paite, Milhiem and other [[tributary]] tribes.
