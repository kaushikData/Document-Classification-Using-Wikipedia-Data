{{Egyptian crisis (2011–14)}}

The '''2012–13 Egyptian protests''' were part of a large scale popular uprising in Egypt against then-President Mohamed Morsi.  On 22 November 2012, millions of protesters began protesting against Morsi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptians take anti-Morsi protests to presidential palace|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/egyptians-take-antimorsi-protests-to-presidential-palace-8385721.html|last1=McCrumen|first1=Stephanie|last2=Hauslohner|first2=Abigail|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=5 December 2012|accessdate=5 December 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; after his government announced a temporary constitutional declaration that in effect granted the president unlimited powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/morsy-issues-new-constitutional-declaration |title=Morsy issues new constitutional declaration |publisher=Egypt Independent |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Story of the Egyptian Revolution 2011–2013 |medium=Documentary |language=English, Arabic |url=https://archive.org/details/EgyptRevolution |date=15 November 2013 |minutes=10 |publisher=[[Internet Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morsi deemed the decree necessary to protect the elected constituent assembly from a planned dissolution by judges appointed during the Mubarak era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David D.

On 8 December 2012, Morsi annulled his temporary decree which had expanded his presidential authority and removed judicial review of his decrees, an Islamist official said, but added that the results of the temporary declaration would still stand.&lt;ref name="alarab912"&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt's Mursi annuls controversial decree, opposition says not enough|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/12/09/254059.html|accessdate=9 December 2012|publisher=Al Arabiya|date=9 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209000212/http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/12/09/254059.html|archive-date=9 December 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the anti-government protests in Egypt, Morsi supporters gathered in Rabaa el-Adaweya to celebrate the one-year anniversary of Morsi's inauguration.

However, on 30 June 2013, the first anniversary of the election of Morsi, thousands of Morsi opponents [[June 2013 Egyptian protests|massed]] in Tahrir Square and outside the main presidential palace in the [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]] suburb demanding Morsi's resignation.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23122191|title=BBC in Egypt: 'People were not expecting this'|date=30 June 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations were also reported in 18 locations across Cairo&lt;ref name="TheAtlanticJune30" /&gt; and in other different locations across the country including Alexandria, El-Mahalla and cities in the Suez Canal region.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/30/us-egypt-protests-idUSBRE95Q0NO20130630|title=Millions flood Egypt's streets to demand Mursi quit|date=30 June 2013|work=Reuters|first=Asma|last=Alsharif}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="menasolidaritynetwork.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://menasolidaritynetwork.com/2013/06/28/egypt-mahalla-workers-join-rebellion-reject-privatisation-plans/|title=Egypt: Mahalla workers join rebellion, reject privatization plans|date=28 June 2013|work=MENA Solidarity Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various political organizations supported the demonstrations, including the [[Tamarod]] movement formed by members of the [[Kefaya|Egyptian Movement for Change]], which claimed to have collected 22 million signatures calling for Morsi's resignation.&lt;ref name="AlArabiya30June" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AlArabiya29June"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/06/29/-Rebel-campaign-receives-more-than-22-million-signatures-in-anti-Mursi-petition.html|title=Anti-Mursi 'Rebel' campaign receives more than 22 million signatures|date=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On 22 November 2012, Morsi issued a constitutional declaration purporting to protect the [[Constituent Assembly of Egypt]] from judicial interference. The declaration stated that it only applies until [[2012 Draft Constitution of Egypt|a new constitution]] is ratified.&lt;ref name="nullandvoid"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/world/middleeast/morsi-urged-to-retract-edict-to-bypass-judges-in-egypt.html |title=Morsi Urged to Retract Edict to Bypass Judges |last=Kirkpatrick |first=David |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=24 November 2012 |archivedate=25 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CRTUGdn8?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/world/middleeast/morsi-urged-to-retract-edict-to-bypass-judges-in-egypt.html?_r=0 |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 November 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration also requires new trials for people acquitted of Mubarak-era killings of protesters, and extends the mandate of the constituent assembly by two months. Additionally, the declaration authorizes Morsi to take all measures necessary to these ends.&lt;ref name="abcnews1" /&gt;

In effect, the declaration makes all constitutional declarations, laws and decrees made since Morsi assumed power immune to appeal by any individual, political or governmental body.&lt;ref name="BBC20121122"&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt's President Mursi assumes sweeping powers|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20451208|publisher=BBC News Middle East|accessdate=30 November 2012|date=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stack"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stack|first=Liam|title=Anger in Egypt Over Power Grab by President Morsi|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/23/anger-in-egypt-over-power-grab-by-president-morsi/?src=recg|accessdate=30 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kareem Fahim and David D.

==Timeline==

===July 2012===

On 8 July, Mohamed Morsi issued a decree calling back into session the [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011–2012#Dissolution, reinstatement decree|dissolved parliament]] for 10 July 2012. Morsi's decree also called for [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2013|new parliamentary elections]] to be held within 60 days of the adoption of a [[Egyptian constitutional referendum, 2012|new constitution]] for the country, which is tentatively expected for late 2012. [[Constituent of Egypt|A constitutional assembly]] selected by the erstwhile parliament has been formed and has begun the work of drafting the constitution. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) hold an emergency meeting in response to the decree, but adjourn the meeting without making an announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptian parliament to convene Tuesday, official says|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/08/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html?hpt=hp_t3|publisher=CNN|accessdate=12 July 2012|author=Mohamed Fadel Fahmy|date=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt's Morsi makes bid to reinstate Islamist parliament|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/egypts-morsi-makes-bid-to-reinstate-islamist-parliament/2012/07/08/gJQAQTnDWW_story.html|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=8 July 2012|author1=Steve Hendrix |author2=Ernesto Londoño }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptian President Mursi reverses parliament dissolution|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18761403|publisher=BBC News Middle East|accessdate=12 July 2012|date=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt's President Orders Return of Parliament|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/09/world/middleeast/egypts-president-orders-return-of-dissolved-parliament.html?_r=2|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 July 2012|author1=Kareem Fahim |author2=Mayy El Sheikh }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt's Morsi orders parliament to reconvene|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/07/201278153339685112.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=12 July 2012|date=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July, Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi's order to reconvene parliament was rejected by Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court which said after meeting on 9 July 2012 that all its rulings and decisions, including its judgement that part of the election for parliament was unconstitutional and which led in return to the assembly's dissolution by the SCAF, are final, not subject to appeal and binding for all state institutions. With its ruling the court asserted that Morsi had no right to reconvene parliament after the court ordered it dissolved in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt court challenges Mursi's reopening of parliament|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18765947|publisher=BBC News Middle East|accessdate=12 July 2012|date=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120710" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Watson|first=Ivan|title=Court overrules Egypt's president on parliament|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/10/world/meast/egypt-politics/index.html?hpt=iaf_c2|publisher=CNN|accessdate=12 July 2012|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the constituent assembly tasked with drawing up Egypt's new constitution is currently functioning, after being selected by the dissolved parliament, the SCAF also gave itself the power to choose a new assembly if the current one runs into any problems according to Al Jazeera.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120710"&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt's top court rebukes president's decree|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/07/201279124421528560.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=12 July 2012|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 9 July statement the military council said its constitutional declaration which gave it broad powers "came as a result of the political, legal and constitutional circumstances that the country was facing" and added that the declaration "ensures the continuity of state institutions and the [military council] until a new constitution is drafted". The military said it was "confident" that all state institutions will respect constitutional declarations.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120710"/&gt;

On 10 July, Egypt's parliament convened despite dissolution, but the session was adjourned by Speaker Saad al-Katatni after the members of parliament approved Katatni's proposal that the parliament seek legal advice from the Court of Cassation on how to implement the supreme court's ruling. Thousands gathered in Cairo in protest of a ruling by Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court to freeze the decree issued by President Mohamed Morsi to reinstate the Islamist-led parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt's parliament convenes despite dissolution|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18777150|publisher=BBC News Middle East|accessdate=13 July 2012|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt parliament meets in defiance of court|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/07/201271054440593307.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=13 July 2012|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thousands in Cairo protest high court ruling|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/07/20127101852134809.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=13 July 2012|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN20120712"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt court overturns President Mursi parliament order|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18789992|publisher=BBC News Middle East|accessdate=13 July 2012|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP20120710"&gt;{{cite news|title=Morsi convenes Egypt's parliament in defiance of court and military|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/morsi-convenes-egypts-parliament-in-defiance-of-court-and-military/2012/07/10/gJQAGHr9ZW_story_1.html/2012/07/10/gJQAGHr9ZW_story.html|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=10 July 2012|author1=Ernesto Londoño |author2=Steve Hendrix }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Supreme Constitutional Court ruled that Morsi did not have the right to reconstitute the body,&lt;ref name="WP20120710"/&gt; it also threatened the new president with the equivalent of contempt of court if he continued to reject its decisions.&lt;ref name="NYT20120710"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirkpatrick|first=David D.|title=Egyptian Leaders Meet in Defiance of Court and Military|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/world/middleeast/egyptian-parliamentary-deputies-defy-court-and-military.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament asked Egypt's Court of Cassation to essentially overrule the aspect of the Supreme Constitutional Court's decision holding that the whole Parliament must be immediately dissolved because of flaws in the electoral system used to fill a third of the seats.

On 14 July, the parliament's request to examine Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court ruling that dissolved the Islamist-led assembly was rebuffed by the Court of Cassation.

On 16 July, more than 20000 workers at Egypt's largest textiles manufacturing company, which saw major strikes in [[2006 El-Mahalla El-Kubra strike|2006]] and [[2008 Egyptian general strike|2008]], began their first day of strikes demanding an increase in wages and more government investment in their sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/egyworkers-strike-mahalla-0022286 |title=Egyworkers strike in Mahalla |publisher=Stream.aljazeera.com |date=16 July 2012 |accessdate=8 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029030355/http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/egyworkers-strike-mahalla-0022286 |archive-date=29 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 July, the Administrative Judiciary Court of the State Council put on hold all appeals against the formulation of the Constituent Assembly, tasked with drafting a new constitution, until the court decides on 30 July 2012 on suits calling for a change of the judge presiding over the case.

On 11 September, a protest was organized by [[Wesam Abdel-Wareth]], a [[Salafi]]st leader and president of Egypt's [[Hekma (TV station)|Hekma television channel]], who called for a gathering at 5&amp;nbsp;pm in front of the United States Embassy, to protest against a film that he thought was named ''Muhammad's Trial'', which is actually called [[Innocence of Muslims]].&lt;ref name="ahram"&gt;[http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/0/52567/Egypt/Egypt-army-intervenes-to-pacify-Salafist-protest-a.aspx Egypt army intervenes to pacify Salafist protest at U.S. embassy], Ahram Online, 11 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sfgate0914"&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/business/bloomberg/article/Egyptian-Protesters-Scale-U-S-Embassy-Walls-Rip-3865961.php "Egyptian Protesters Scale U.S. Embassy Walls, Rip Down Flag"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 14 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; After the trailer for the film began circulating, [https://twitter.com/naderbakkar Nader Bakkar], the Egyptian Salafist [[Nour Party]]'s spokesman, and [[Muhammad al-Zawahiri]], the brother of al-Qaeda leader [[Zawahiri|Ayman al Zawihiri]], called for Egyptians to assemble outside of the American embassy.&lt;ref name="Blind sheikh motive"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2012/09/12/libyan-officials-us-ambassador-killed-in-attack/57752828/1| title=Deadly embassy attacks were days in the making|work=USA Today|date=13 September 2012|accessdate=16 September 2012|author1=Lynch, Sara |author2=Dorell, Oren }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 3,000 demonstrators, many of them from the ultraconservative [[Salafi]]st movement, responded to his call.

Some of the protesters also wrote "There is no God but Allah" on the compound walls. According to [[Sherine Tadros]] of ''[[Al Jazeera]]'', the protestors demanded that the film be taken "out of circulation" and that some of the protestors would stay at the site until that happens. Thousands of Egyptian riot police were at the embassy following the breach of the walls; they eventually persuaded the trespassers to leave the compound without the use of force. After that, only a few hundred protesters remained outside the compound.&lt;ref name="aljaz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/09/20129112108737726.html|title=US envoy dies in Benghazi consulate attack|date=12 September 2012|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the entry into the embassy grounds [[Marine Security Guard|United States Marines]] were not allowed to carry live ammunition by the State Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reports: Marines Not Permitted Live Ammo|author=Adam Kredo|url=http://freebeacon.com/reports-marines-not-permitted-live-ammo/|newspaper=Free Beacon|publisher=Center for American Freedom|date=13 September 2012|accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt's prime minister [[Hesham Kandil]] said "a number" of protesters later confessed to getting paid to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/15/world/meast/egypt-us-embassy-protests/index.html|title=Amid uneasy calm in Cairo, prime minister says some were paid to protest|date=15 September 2012|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September, Egypt's Supreme Administrative Court upheld an earlier Supreme Constitutional Court ruling, which had ordered the dissolution of the lower house of Egypt's parliament (People's Assembly) based on the unconstitutionality of some of the parliamentary elections law. The administrative court said that since the electoral laws on which the People's Assembly was elected were found to be unconstitutional, the entire composition of the assembly is invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egyptian court rules parliament's lower house "null"|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-09/23/c_131867235.htm|publisher=[[Xinhua]]|accessdate=24 September 2012|date=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt court upholds dissolution of house|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-68809-Egypt-court-upholds-dissolution-of-house|accessdate=24 September 2012|newspaper=[[The News International]]|date=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Administrative court upholds ruling to dissolve Parliament|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/administrative-court-upholds-ruling-dissolve-parliament|accessdate=24 September 2012|newspaper=Egypt Independent|date=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt Islamists slam parliament's death knell, liberals celebrate|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/53609/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-Islamists-slam-parliaments-death-knell,-libe.aspx|accessdate=24 September 2012|newspaper=Al-Ahram|date=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 October, Egyptian president Morsi has ordered pardon for all persons who already have convictions and those who are still under investigation or are on trial for deeds "committed with the aim of supporting the revolution and bringing about its objectives." The decree included felonies, misdemeanors committed to support the uprising to achieve its goals from 25 January 2011 until 30 June 2012 except crimes of first degree murder and abides the general prosecutor and the military attorney general, each one in his field to publish a list for those given amnesty in the official newspaper. The persons missed can submit a complaint in a month from the date of publication, and one or more committees will be formed to consider the complaints under the presidency of the head of court of cessation within thirty days of the date of the complaints.&lt;ref name="XinhuaChinaDaily20121009"&gt;{{cite web|title=Morsi orders amnesty for convicted criminals during Egypt's uprising|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2012-10/09/content_15802937.htm|work=Xinhua|publisher=China Daily|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC20121009"&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt's President Mursi pardons 'revolutionaries'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19877428|publisher=BBC News Middle East|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gayathri|first=Amrutha|title=Egypt's President Pardons Prisoners of Revolution|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/egypts-president-pardons-prisoners-revolution-843225|newspaper=International Business Times|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt's President pardons revolutionaries of 2011–2012|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2012_10_09/Egypt-s-President-pardons-revolutionaries-of-2011-2012/|publisher=The Voice of Russia|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt's President pardons all political prisoners|url=http://www.euronews.com/2012/10/09/egypt-s-president-pardons-all-political-prisoners/|publisher=Euronews|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt's President pardons 'revolutionaries'|url=http://www.ptinews.com/news/3035296_Egypt-s-President-pardons--revolutionaries--|publisher=Press Trust of India|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Areeb Hasni|title=Egypt: President Mursi pardons all ‘revolution’ detainees|url=http://www.thenewstribe.com/2012/10/09/egypt-president-mursi-pardons-all-revolution-detainees/|publisher=The News Tribe|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mursi pardons those convicted over 'revolution'|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/10/09/242632.html|publisher=Al Arabiya|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Marwa Awad|title=Egypt's Mursi pardons political prisoners|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-egypt-president-pardonbre89711k-20121008,0,394341.story|work=Reuters|publisher=The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=9 October 2012|date= October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October, Egypt's prosecutor general Abdel-Maguid Mahmoud failed to win a conviction of two dozen Mubarak allies charged with orchestrating an attack by thugs on the protesters who ousted Mubarak. Some of the thugs were mounted, and the resulting melee became known as 2 February 2011 Battle of the Camels where men riding horses and camels charged into crowds on Cairo's Tahrir Square, setting off two days of clashes that ended with killing of nearly a dozen people.&lt;ref name="APBoston20121011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT20121011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirkpatrick|first=David D.|title=Egypt's Chief Prosecutor Resists President's Effort to Oust Him|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/12/world/middleeast/egypts-chief-prosecutor-refuses-morsis-effort-to-oust-him.html?_r=1&amp;|accessdate=14 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activist groups and political parties called for a nationwide protest on 12 October 2011 after a court acquitted all 24 people charged with involvement in the Battle of Camels.&lt;ref name="WP20121011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hauslohner|first=Abigail|title=Egypt's Morsi moves to dismiss top prosecutor after 'camel battle' acquittals|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egypts-morsi-moves-to-dismiss-top-prosecutor-after-camel-battle-acquittals/2012/10/11/d761795c-13e5-11e2-be82-c3411b7680a9_story.html|accessdate=14 October 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October, despite the fact that Egyptian law protects the prosecutor general from being ousted by the president, President Morsi ordered Egypt's prosecutor general Abdel-Maguid Mahmoud to leave his position to defuse public anger over acquittals in the Battle of the Camels case. Mahmoud, however, refused to step down and become Egypt's ambassador to the Vatican.&lt;ref name="APBoston20121011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Michael|first=Maggie|title=Egypt's prosecutor general refuses to resign|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middle-east/2012/10/11/egypt-president-removes-prosecutor-general-acquittals-regime-loyalists-spark-anger/nbpqGsoWlJGvDeXMKy7YqK/story.html|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Boston.com|date=11 October 2012|accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT20121011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WP20121011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="APHP20121012"/&gt;

On 12 October, critics and supporters of President Morsi clashed in Cairo's Tahrir Square during a rally, as liberal and secular activists erupted with anger accusing the Muslim Brotherhood of trying to take over the country.

The secular camp accused the Brotherhood of holding the gathering to "hijack" the square from their anti-Morsi protest. The violence erupted when Morsi supporters stormed a stage set up by the rival camp, angered by chants they perceived as insults to the president.&lt;ref name="APHP20121012"/&gt;

On 13 October, Morsi backed down on 13 October 2012 from his decision to remove the country's top prosecutor Abdel-Maguid Mahmoud, keeping him in his post and sidestepping a potential clash with the country's powerful judiciary. The two-day standoff between Morsi and Prosecutor General Mahmoud escalated with a backlash from a powerful group of judges who said Morsi's move had infringed upon their authority and on the judiciary's independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=El Deeb|first=Sarah|title=Egypt standoff between president, prosecutor ends|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Top-Egypt-prosecutor-defies-sacking-by-president-3945251.php|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Seattle Pi|accessdate=14 October 2012|date=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt leader Mursi backs down in row with prosecutor|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19935961|work=BBC News Middle East|publisher=BBC News Middle East|accessdate=14 October 2012|date=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt's Vice President Mahmoud Mekki told reporters after meeting the prosecutor that the president agreed to suspend the decision to make Mahmoud Egypt's ambassador to the Vatican following a request from the country's Supreme Judicial Council.

On 23 November, protests erupted in Cairo, the port city of Alexandria and elsewhere around Egypt, as opponents of Morsi clashed with his supporters over his 22 November declaration.

On 24 November, the Supreme Judicial Council  lambasted the president's constitutional declaration and called it an "unprecedented attack on the independence of the judicial branch". The leadership of the [[Egypt Judges Club]], an association of judges from across the country, called for a nationwide strike in all courts and prosecution offices to protest the president's declaration. State news media reported that judges and prosecutors had already declared a strike in Alexandria. MENA news agency reported that Egyptian human rights agencies filed a lawsuit at the Court of Administrative Justice calling for the declaration to be annulled.

On 25 November, shares on Egypt's stock market plunged almost 10%. Trading was suspended for 30 minutes as shares slumped in the first session since the president's 22 November constitutional declaration.

On 27 November, tens of thousands of people held protests in Cairo against  Morsi demanding that their first freely elected leader respect their wishes either to roll back his 22 November constitutional declaration or to resign. At least one demonstrator died in early clashes with authorities before Tuesday night's massive rally. The opposition Popular Alliance Party said the protester died after inhaling excessive amounts of tear gas, which police used in numerous scuffles with rock-throwing protesters on the side streets leading to the square. And in the Nile Delta city of Mahalla, police reported dozens of injuries when demonstrators stormed and destroyed the headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood. Protests were also held in Alexandria and other cities.

The clashes took the lives of five peoples, including two policemen and three civilians.

On 16 May, seven Egyptian soldiers were kidnapped by unknown militants in the Sinai demanding the release of members of an Islamist group detained for almost two years. One week later, they were reportedly released and handed over to the army in an area south of [[Rafah]] after talks mediated by tribal chiefs in the region with president Morsi greeting them upon their arrival at Cairo's airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/militants-release-seven-egyptians-kidnapped-sinai|title=Militants release seven Egyptians kidnapped in Sinai|date=22 May 2013|publisher=Egypt Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real issue though is Morsi's way of dealing with the crisis with most actions taken by the government to solve the problem receiving wide criticism. Such reactions include Morsi's call for a national dialogue instead of either fighting or negotiating with the kidnappers and for also appearing as being concerned for the safety of the kidnapped soldiers and their kidnappers equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/05/20/regarding-the-kidnapped-soldiers/|title=Regarding the kidnapped Soldiers|date=20 May 2013|publisher=Daily News Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohamed Sayed Abu-Shaqra, a security officer, was assassinated more than a week later by suspected jihadists near El-Arish while investigating the identity of the kidnappers and their location. During his funeral, relatives and colleagues started chanting against the president forcing the Interior minister to leave the military ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/police-blame-sinai-jihadis-officer-s-murder|title=Police blame Sinai jihadis for officer's murder|date=10 June 2013|publisher=Egypt Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContentPrint/1/0/73635/Egypt/0/Egypt-interior-minister-forced-to-leave-security-o.aspx|title=Egypt interior minister forced to leave security officer's funeral|date=10 June 2013|publisher=Ahram Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===June 2013===
On 17 June, Morsi appointed Adel el-Khayat, an Islamist possibly linked to the [[Luxor massacre]] where at least 58 tourists were brutally killed by [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]] gunmen, as governor of Luxor with 17 other provincial governors. The move sparked protests by tourism workers and activists in Luxor outside el-Khayat's office forcing him to finally resign a week later in order to prevent bloodshed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/17/morsi-appoints-islamist-governor-luxor|title=Egypt's Mohamed Morsi appoints hardline Islamist to govern Luxor|date=17 June 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|first=Patrick|last=Kingsley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/egypt-morsi-appointed-luxor-governor-resigns-114403748.html|title=Egypt: Morsi-appointed Luxor governor resigns|date=23 June 2013|work=Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June, four [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]] [[Abu Musallam incident|were attacked]] by an angry mob led by Salafist preachers. The attackers numbering at least several hundred surrounded the house and demanded [[Hassan Shehata (Shia cleric)|Hassan Shehata]], a local Shia leader, and his followers who were attending a worshiping ceremony to leave the house before storming it with molotov cocktails.

During the conference, Sheikh Mohamed Hassan and al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya's Mohamed Abdel-Maqsoud used sectarian speech against the Shias. Morsi was present during the event so he was heavily criticized by the media for not reacting against the hate and sectarianism used by both clerics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContentPrint/1/0/74899/Egypt/0/Amnesty-urges-Morsi-to-protect-Egypt%E2%80%99s-Shias.aspx|title=Amnesty urges Morsi to protect Egypt's Shias|date=25 June 2013|work=Ahram Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June, Morsi delivered a two-hour-and-forty-minute speech to the nation. It was supposed to be a re-conciliatory speech but was widely viewed as provocative and full of threats and accusations targeted against his opponents including media presenters and [[Ahmed Shafik]], his former rival in the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2012|2012 Egyptian presidential elections]].

===July 2013 (ousting of Morsi)===

On the morning of 1 July, anti-Morsi protesters ransacked the national headquarters of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in Cairo. Protesters threw objects at windows and looted the building, making off with office equipment and documents. The [[Ministry of Health and Population (Egypt)|health ministry]] confirmed the deaths of eight people who had been killed in clashes around the headquarters in [[Mokattam]].&lt;ref name="BBC News #2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt protesters storm Muslim Brotherhood headquarters|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23125387|accessdate=1 July 2013|work=BBC News|date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hours later, the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]] issued a 48-hour ultimatum which gave the country's political parties until 3 July to meet the demands of the Egyptian people. The  military also threatened to intervene if the dispute is not resolved by then.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|last=Abdelaziz|first=Salma|title=Egyptian military issues warning over protests|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/01/world/meast/egypt-protests/index.html?hpt=hp_t1|accessdate=1 July 2013|work=[[CNN]]|date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four Ministers also resigned on the same day: [[Ministry of Tourism (Egypt)|Tourism Minister]] [[Hisham Zazou]] (who previously offered to resign a few months ago after Morsi appointed an Islamist linked to the group that attacked tourists as governor of Luxor), [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (Egypt)|Communication and IT Minister]] [[Atef Helmi]], State Minister for Legal and Parliamentary Affairs [[Hatem Bagato]] and State Minister for Environmental Affairs [[Khaled Abdel Aal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Patrick Werr|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/01/us-egypt-protests-ministers-idUSBRE9600IE20130701|accessdate=1 July 2013|title=Four Egyptian ministers resign after protests: cabinet official|work=Reuters|date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the government with members of the [[Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt)|Freedom and Justice Party]].

Incidentally the [[Court of Cassation (Egypt)|Court of Cassation]] ordered the reinstatement of former general prosecutor [[Abdel Meguid Mahmoud|Abdel Maguid Mahmoud]] who was replaced with [[Talaat Abdallah]] following the constitutional declaration on 22 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court orders return of Meguid Mahmoud as prosecutor general|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/court-orders-return-meguid-mahmoud-prosecutor-general|accessdate=2 July 2013|newspaper=[[Egypt Independent]]|date=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Presidency spokesman and the spokesman for the cabinet resigned as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/latest-wave-resignations-cabinet-presidency-spokesmen-quit|date = 2 July 2013|title = Latest wave of resignations as Cabinet, Presidency spokesmen quit |publisher = Egypt Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' reported that if there was no resolution the military would suspend the [[constitution of Egypt]] and appoint a new council of experts to draft a new one, institute a three-person executive council and appoint a prime minister from the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirkpatrick|first=David D.|title=Morsi Defies Egypt Army's Ultimatum to Bend to Protest|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/03/world/middleeast/egypt-protests.html|accessdate=3 July 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 July 2013|author2=Hubbard, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morsi's military advisor, [[Sami Hafez Anan]], also resigned and said that the army would not "abandon the will of the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/07/20137215593626253.html |title=Morsi tells Egypt army to withdraw ultimatum – Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morsi declared, in a late-night television address, that he would "defend the legitimacy of his elected office with his life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23154233|title=Egypt's Mohammed Morsi vows to stay in office|date=3 July 2013|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that "there is no substitute for legitimacy" as he vowed not to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/07/20137222343142718.html |title=Egypt's Morsi says he will not step down – Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morsi accused supporters of Hosni Mubarak of exploiting the wave of protests to topple the government and fight democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/egypt-protesters-mass-after-morsi-snub/story-fn3dxix6-1226673461184 | work=The Australian | title=Egypt military chiefs hold crisis talks | date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces|SCAF]] leaders also issued a statement entitled "The Final Hours" in which they said that the military is willing to shed its blood "to protect the people against terrorists and fools" following Morsi's refusal to step down from his elected office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt's President Mohammed Morsi, Army Chiefs Prepare For Showdown Hours Ahead of Ultimatum|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/03/egypt-president-morsi-army-showdown_n_3539548.html?ref=topbar|publisher=Huffington Post | first=Eline|last=Gordts|date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July, unknown gunmen opened fire on a pro-Morsi rally in Cairo, killing 16 and wounding 200.&lt;ref name="dawn"&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://dawn.com/news/1022322/gun-attack-on-cairo-pro-morsi-rally-kills-16-ministry|title=Gun attack on Cairo pro-Morsi rally kills 16: ministry}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 16:35 deadline set by the army approached, military leaders met for emergency talks with the army expected to issue a statement when the deadline passes. [[Mohamed El-Baradei]], who was chosen to represent the [[National Salvation Front (Egypt)|National Salvation Front]], was also said to have met army chief General [[Abdul Fatah al-Sisi]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/07/20137394753443155.html |title=Egypt's Morsi offers consensus government – Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 July, just before the deadline approached, Morsi offered to form a consensus government. An army statement read: "The General Command of the Armed Forces is currently meeting with a number of religious, national, political and youth icons...There will be a statement issued from the General Command as soon as they are done." At the same time the Freedom and Justice Party's senior leader, [[Waleed al-Haddad]], said: "We do not go to invitations (meetings) with anyone. We have a president and that's it."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The head of the Egyptian Armed Forces and Defense Minister Abdul Fatah al-Sisi spoke at night from Cairo and said that the army was standing apart from the political process but was using its vision as the Egyptian people were calling for help and discharged its responsibility. Morsi was removed from power, the draft constitution was suspended and Chief Justice [[Adli Mansour]] was named interim president. Mohammed el-Baradei says the roadmap was to rectify the issues of the revolution. The [[Grand Imam of al-Azhar|Grand Sheikh of Al Azhar]] [[Ahmed el-Tayeb]], the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Pope]] [[Pope Tawadros II of Alexandria|Tawadros II]] as well as opposition leader [[Mohamed ElBaradei|Mohamed El Baradei]] and a youth member of the [[Rebel (movement)|Tamarod]] movement, who were present during the statement, spoke in support of the 3 July coup. The move led to continuous [[Post-coup unrest in Egypt (2013–14)|civil unrest]] in Egypt until the present day.

'''9ice''' (born '''Abolore Ajifolajifaola Adegbola Akande''', on 17 January 1980){{citation needed|date=April 2013}} is a Nigerian musician. He is a south-westerner from [[Ogbomoso]] in [[Oyo State]] but he grew up in the district of [[Bariga]] in [[Lagos]].

9ice won the award for Best Hip Hop Artist at the [[MTV Africa Music Awards 2008#Best Hip-Hop|MTV Africa Music Awards]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigerians sweep MTV Africa awards|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7744492.stm|accessdate=13 February 2016|work=BBC News|date=23 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[The Headies 2008|third edition of the Hip Hop World Awards]] held in Nigeria, he won the [[The Headies Award for Hip Hop World Revelation of the Year|Revelation of the Year award]] and  [[The Headies Award for Best Vocal Performance (Male)|Best Male Vocal Performer]]. A month later at the first SoundCity Music Video Awards, he was nominated in the category of Best New Artist. 9ice's biggest single is titled "Gongo Aso". He is the founder of [[Alapomeji Records]].

In 2014, 9ice revealed that he was going to contest for a political office in his native Ogbomosho in Oyo state. He joined the All Progressive Congress (APC) and declared his interest to contest for a seat at the Federal House of Representatives. He lost out during the primaries. 9ice was  named as a Special Adviser to the Oyo state Governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi.

==Growing up==
9ice attended Abule Okuta Primary School and [[CMS Grammar School, Lagos|CMS Grammar School]], and dropped out from his law course at the [[Lagos State University]] to concentrate on music. He grew up in a [[Polygamy|polygamous]] home of five wives and nine children. His parents found about his singing career a year after it started around 2000. Before then, 9ice wrote his own songs, beginning at age 14. As a big fan of Pasuma Wonder, he kick-started his singing career with [[Fuji music]].  He derives his inspiration from his environment, and music from the likes of [[Ebenezer Obey]], [[King Sunny Adé]], Tatalo Alamu, the late Alhaji Ayinla Omowura, and the late Alhaji Haruna Ishola.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Early career==
After recording his first demo, 9ice joined the group Mysterious Boys, with whom he did a couple of tracks before going on to form his own, now defunct, group, Abinibi. Having recorded his first demo, titled ''Risi De Alagbaja'', in 1996, and his first solo song, "Little Money" in 2000, 9ice had to wait until 2005 before gaining recognition in the [[Nigerian music]] market.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The first major break for 9ice came from his first single, "Little Money". Soon after this, he did collaborations with different Nigerian artists that  prompted the release of another hit single, "Ganja Man". ID Cabasa produced this single,  which was released with other songs in March 2006. The [[reggae]] tone and playful style of the song made it an instant hit. 9ice later founded his own record company and released all other albums under that label, Alapomeji Records.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Solo album and sophomore break==
9ice's first album did well, and included the songs "Little Money", "Ganja Man", "Make Dem Talk" and "Music Daddy". ''Gongo Aso'', his second album, included songs covering success, originality, partying and women, as well as themes on the institution of marriage and gratitude. He has eight studio albums to his name which includes; Certificate (2007), Gongo Aso  (2008), Tradition (2009), Versus (2011) Bashorun Gaa (2011), Deluxe Version Versus &amp; Bashorun Gaa (2011), CNN/GRA (2014) and ID Cabasa (2016).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pulse.ng/buzz/9ice-singer-releases-8th-studio-album-titled-id-cabasa-id5792433.html&lt;/ref&gt;
He is recognized to be the first Nigerian hip-hop artist to release two albums in a year which are C.N.N (Canceling Numerous Negativity) and G.R.A (Galvanizing Right Ahead).

==Live shows==
Since late 2007 9ice has featured prominently across Nigerian campuses in the Soundcity/MTN Campus Blast tours; Lets Go There Tour With Ariya Entertainment in NY, LA, Chicago, Houston, Maryland in 2008; [[Star Mega Jam]] in 2007-2010; and London [[Troxy]] in 2008 and 2010. 9ice performed at the [[Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute]] concert (singing "Gongo Aso") in London on 27 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7475962.stm |title=Reporter's log, Mandela concert |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=1 July 2008 |date=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these shows and concerts were sold-out events. He also headlined sold-out shows in the Netherlands and Malaysia in October 2010 to mark his country's 50-year anniversary of independence. In 2010, 9ice embarked on a European tour through parts of Italy, Spain and Switzerland. He also performed live in [[Cyprus]] at Lions Garden, where many  Nigerian students were in attendance.

==His style==
9ice is known for his use of the [[Yoruba language]] in his music, and he sometimes mixes Yoruba proverbs with English, broken English, Hausa and Igbo. 9ice compares himself to [[Youssou N'Dour]], who has won a couple of [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] awards  with music recorded in his mother tongue, and [[Yvonne Chaka Chaka]], whose music has also embraced her language. 9ice has been quoted as saying, "English language has been imposed on us but God graciously gave Yoruba language to us."

In January 2014, 9ice announced plans to run for a political office in 2015 as a House of Representatives member representing the Ogbomoso North Constituency, Oyo state in the National Assembly. He contested for the seat under the umbrella of the APC but lost at the party primaries.

In April 2015, the “Gongo Aso” singer was appointed a special adviser to the governor of Oyo state, Abiola Ajimobi.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

{{nihongo|'''''A Note to a Certain Old Friend'''''|或旧友へ送る手記|Aru Kyūyū he Okuru Shuki}} is the title of the suicide note left by the famed Japanese short story writer, [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]]. This was the last thing Akutagawa wrote before he committed suicide at the age of 35 in 1927. The letter was addressed to his close friend and fellow writer [[Masao Kume]].

Akutagawa begins the note by stating his reason for his decision. He mentions that the author Reigner wrote in one of his short stories that no one who commits suicide fully knows why they do. “A vague sense of anxiety about my own future” is the reason Akutagawa gives.

Next, he goes on to write that he had been thinking about death for the last two years with a specific interest in the process of death itself. He writes that ''A Fool's Life'' describes his thoughts completely except for the “social factor” which he purposely omitted from the story. “I think I analyzed it all in "A Fool's Life," except for a social factor, namely the shadow of feudalism cast over my life"

Akutagawa then writes his thought process on how he came to decide on his manner of his death. He does this in a straightforward calculated fashion.  He states that he does not believe, unlike “the Westerners”, that suicide is a sin. He decides to commit the act in the least painful way possible and researches each manner of death to find the best way. He dismissed a variety of ways to commit suicide  “for aesthetic and practical reasons”. Finally he concludes that death by drugs in his house is the best option, despite the hassle it might cause his family. He writes that He feels that he has enough courage to do it alone, without a partner. This whole process, he writes, took him several months to prepare.

Akutagawa then writes that he feels that humans have an animal fear of death and that his fear has been drained out of his body, so much so that he cannot enjoy food or women.

Lastly, he reassures his friend that he does not want to elevate himself to the status of a god, but that he is no more than an ordinary man. He remembers a conversation about "[[Empedocles]] on [[Mount Etna|Etna]]" Kume and he had twenty years prior, in which he stated that he, at that time, did wish to be a god.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2523">'''Abu Bakr Muhammad''' (died 941) was the first [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler of [[Chaghaniyan]] (10th-century&amp;ndash;939) and governor of [[Samanid]] [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]] (933&amp;ndash;939). He was the son of a certain Muzaffar ibn Muhtaj.

== Origins ==
The origin of the Muhtajids is unknown; the name has been given by modern historians after their presumed forebear Muhtaj ({{lang-ar|محتاج}} ''Muḥtāj''). They may have been descended from the [[Principality of Chaghaniyan|Chaghan Khudahs]], who ruled Chaghaniyan during the early [[Middle Ages]]; another possibility is that their ancestors were [[Arabs]] who migrated to the region and were Iranicized. In any case, by the early 10th century Chaghaniyan had become a vassal to the [[Samanids]] of [[Bukhara]].

== Biography ==
He is the first ruler fully attested in sources. Under the Samanids, he was the governor of [[Ferghana]]. When in 929 the Samanid amir [[Nasr II]] was temporarily expelled from power by his brothers, Muhammad remained loyal to him. As a result, when Nasr managed to restore himself he rewarded Muhammad with the governorship of [[Balkh]], and then in 933 made him governor of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]]. During his time as governor of Khurasan, Muhammad battled various [[Dailamite]] bands in northern Iran. In 939 he fell ill and was replaced from his post by his son [[Abu 'Ali Chaghani]]; he died in 941.

'''''Beloved''''' is a 1987 novel by the American writer [[Toni Morrison]]. Set after the [[American Civil War]] (1861–65), it is inspired by the story of an [[African Americans|African-American]] [[Slavery in the United States|slave]], [[Margaret Garner]], who escaped slavery in [[Kentucky]] late January 1856 by fleeing to [[Ohio]], a [[Slave and free states|free state]]. Morrison had come across the story "A Visit to the Slave Mother who Killed Her Child" in an 1856 newspaper article published in the ''American Baptist'' and reproduced in ''The Black Book'', a miscellaneous compilation of black history and culture that Morrison edited in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Goulimar, Pelagia, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aiupAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=beloved+%22A+Visit+to+the+Slave+Mother+who+Killed+Her+Child%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bM7ORKGzWo&amp;sig=wGCkpURViaM6Os7t3cp7FcUoBAA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZhqWk65DXAhUGaVAKHdAiDx8Q6AEIMzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20black%20book%201974%20toni%20morrison%20beloved%20%22A%20Visit%20to%20the%20Slave%20Mother%20who%20Killed%20Her%20Child%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false "Beloved (1987)"], in ''Toni Morrison'', Routledge, 2011, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Beloved'' begins in 1873 in Cincinnati, Ohio, where the protagonist Sethe, a former slave,  has been living with her eighteen-year-old daughter Denver. Sethe's mother-in-law, Baby Suggs lived with them until her death eight years earlier. Just before Baby Suggs' death, Sethe's two sons, Howard and Buglar, run away. Sethe believes they fled because of the malevolent presence of an abusive ghost that haunted their house at 124 Bluestone Road for years. The story opens with an introduction to the ghost: "124 was spiteful. Full of a baby's venom."&lt;ref name=Schapiro&gt;{{cite journal

==Plot summary==
The book is the story of Sethe and her youngest daughter Denver after their escape from slavery. Their home in [[Cincinnati]] is haunted by a [[revenant (folklore)|revenant]], whom they believe to be the ghost of Sethe's eldest daughter. Because of the haunting—which often involves objects being thrown around the room—Sethe's youngest daughter Denver is shy, friendless, and housebound, and her sons, Howard and Buglar, have run away from home by the age of 13. Baby Suggs, the mother of Sethe's husband Halle, dies in her bed soon afterwards.

Paul D, one of the slaves from Sweet Home—the [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] where Baby Suggs, Sethe, Halle, and several other slaves once worked—arrives at Sethe's home and tries to bring a sense of reality into the house. In attempting to make the family forget the past, he forces out the spirit. He seems successful at first; he even brings housebound Denver out of the house for the first time in years. But on the way back, they encounter a young woman sitting in front of the house, calling herself Beloved. Paul D is suspicious and warns Sethe, but she is charmed by the young woman and ignores him. 

When made to sleep outside in a shed, Paul D is cornered by Beloved. While they have sex, his mind is filled with horrific memories from his past. Overwhelmed with guilt, Paul D tries to tell Sethe about it but cannot, and instead says he wants her pregnant. Sethe is elated, and Paul D resists Beloved and her influence over him. But when he tells friends at work about his plans to start a new family, they react fearfully. Stamp Paid reveals the reason for the community's rejection of Sethe.

When Paul D asks Sethe about it, she tells him what happened: After escaping from Sweet Home and reaching her waiting children at her mother-in-law's home, Sethe was found by her master, who attempted to reclaim her and her children. Sethe grabbed her children, ran into the tool shed, and tried to kill them all. She succeeded only in killing her eldest daughter, then two years old, by running a saw along her neck. Sethe claims that she was "trying to put my babies where they would be safe." The revelation is too much for Paul D and he leaves. Without him, sense of reality and time moving forward disappears.

Sethe comes to believe that Beloved is the two-year-old daughter she murdered, whose tombstone reads only "Beloved". Sethe begins to spend carelessly and spoil Beloved out of guilt. Beloved becomes angry and more demanding, throwing tantrums when she doesn't get her way. Beloved's presence consumes Sethe's life to the point where she becomes depleted and sacrifices her own need for eating, while Beloved grows bigger and bigger.

In the novel's climax, youngest daughter Denver reaches out and searches for help from the black community, and some of the village women arrive at the house to exorcise Beloved. At the same time, a white man comes into view, the same man that helped Halle's mother, Baby Suggs, by offering her the house as a place to stay after Halle bought her from their owner. He has come for Denver, who asked him for a job, but Denver has not shared this information with Sethe. Unaware of the situation, Sethe attacks the white man with an ice pick and is brought down by the village women. While Sethe is confused and has a "re-memory" of her master coming again, Beloved disappears. The novel resolves with Denver becoming a working member of the community and Paul D returning to Sethe and pledging his love.

==Major themes==

===Mother-daughter relationships===
The maternal bonds between Sethe and her children inhibit her own individuation and prevent the development of her self. Sethe develops a dangerous maternal passion that results in the murder of one daughter, her own "best self", and the estrangement of the surviving daughter from the black community, both in an attempt to salvage her "fantasy of the future", her children, from a life in slavery. However, Sethe fails to recognize her daughter Denver's need for interaction with this community in order to enter into womanhood. Denver finally succeeds at the end of the novel in establishing her own self and embarking on her individuation with the help of Beloved. Contrary to Denver, Sethe only becomes individuated after Beloved's exorcism, at which point Sethe can fully accept the first relationship that is completely "for her", her relationship with Paul D. This relationship relieves Sethe from the ensuing destruction of herself that resulted from the maternal bonds controlling her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beloved and Sethe are both very much emotionally impaired as a result of Sethe's previous enslavement. Slavery creates a situation where a mother is separated from her child, which has devastating consequences for both parties. Furthermore, the earliest need a child has is related to the mother: the baby needs milk from the mother. Sethe is traumatized by the experience of having her milk stolen because it means she cannot form the symbolic bond between herself and her daughter.&lt;ref name="Schapiro" /&gt;

===Psychological impact of slavery===
{{Slavery}}
Because of the experiences of slavery, most slaves repressed these memories in an attempt to forget the past.  This repression and dissociation from the past causes a fragmentation of the self and a loss of true identity. Sethe, Paul D. and Denver all experience this loss of self, which could only be remedied by the acceptance of the past and the memory of their original identities. Beloved serves to remind these characters of their repressed memories, eventually causing the reintegration of their selves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Slavery splits a person into a fragmented figure.&lt;ref name=Fulton&gt;Fulton, Lara Mary (1997). [http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/4/ "An unblinking gaze: Readerly response-ability and racial reconstructions in Toni Morrison's ''The Bluest Eye'' and ''Beloved''"] (M.A. thesis). Waterloo, Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University&lt;/ref&gt; The identity, consisting of painful memories and unspeakable past, denied and kept at bay, becomes a "self that is no self." To heal and humanize, one must constitute it in a language, reorganize the painful events and retell the painful memories. As a result of suffering, the "self" becomes subject to a violent practice of making and unmaking, once acknowledged by an audience becomes real. Sethe, Paul D, and Baby Suggs who all fall short of such realization, are unable to remake their selves by trying to keep their pasts at bay. The 'self' is located in a word, defined by others. The power lies in the audience, or more precisely, in the word – once the word changes, so does the identity. All of the characters in Beloved face the challenge of an unmade self, composed of their "rememories" and defined by perceptions and language. The barrier that keeps them from remaking of the self is the desire for an "uncomplicated past" and the fear that remembering will lead them to "a place they couldn't get back from."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Definition of Manhood ===
The discussion of manhood and masculinity is foreshadowed by the dominant meaning of Sethe's story. ''Beloved'' depicts slavery in two main emotions: Love and Self-Preservation, however, Morrison does more than depict emotions.

The Author dramatizes Paul D's enslavement to speak of his morals of manhood. In fact, it also distorts him from himself.  Morrison expanded on this idea indirectly by revealing different pathways to the meaning of manhood by her stylistic devices. She established new information for understanding the legacy of slavery best depicted through stylistic devices. To understand Paul D's story on manhood, Morrison puts his half- formed words and thoughts to give the audience a “taste” of what is going on inside his mind.
Throughout the novel, Paul D's depiction of manhood was being challenged by the values of the white culture. The Author demonstrates the distinctions between “Western” and “African” values and how the dialogue between the two values is heard through juxtaposition and allusions. She had to maneuver her “message” though the social atmosphere of her words. She did this by character's motives and actions acquire.&lt;ref name="Sitter 1992 17–29"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sitter|first=Deborah Ayer|date=1992|title=The Making of a Man: Dialogic Meaning in Beloved|jstor=3042073|journal=African American Review|volume=26|issue=1|pages=17–29|doi=10.2307/3042073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul D's is a victim of racial inferiority in that his dreams and goals are so high that he will never be able to achieve them because of the color of his skin. However, Paul D does not see color; he sees himself as the same status as his white counterparts even though, during this time, that was never possible. He thought he earned his right to reach each of his goals because of his sacrifices and what he has been through previously in that society will pay him back and allow him to do what his heart desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ng|first=Andrew Hock Soon|date=2011|title=Toni Morrison's Beloved: Space, Architecture, Trauma|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/463494|journal=symploke|language=en|volume=19|issue=1|pages=231–245|issn=1534-0627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction Era]], Jim Crow laws were put in place to limit the movement and involvement of African-Americans in the white-dominant society. Black men during this time had to establish their own identity, which may seem impossible due to all the limitations put upon them. Many black men, like Paul D, struggled to find their meaning in their society and achieving their goals because of the “disabilities” that constrained them to a certain part of the social hierarchy.

In ''Beloved,'' Sethe observes Paul D sitting on the base of the church steps “… liquor bottle in hand, stripped of the very maleness that enables him to caress and love the wounded Sethe…” (132). Throughout the novel, Paul D is sitting on a base of some sort or a foundation like a tree stub or the steps, for instance. This exemplifies his place in society. Black men are the foundation of society because without their hard labor, the white men would not profit. They were coerced into the society where they were deemed “lower-status” because of the color of their skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=7&amp;sid=11511f54-5dcd-4a48-8584-36f62da57212@sessionmgr4010|title=Jim Crow's Disabilities: Racial Injury, Immobility, and the 'Terrible Handi...: at USF Libraries.|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Emancipation Proclamation, September 22, 1862 (1919), by E.G. Renesch.png|thumb|This photo visualizes the Emancipation Proclamation.]]
In the novel, Sethe's child, Beloved, who was murdered by the hands of her mother haunts her. For example, Sethe, Denver, and Paul D go to the neighborhood carnival, which happens to be Sethe's first social outing since killing her daughter. When they return home, that is when Beloved appears at the house. Throughout the novel, Sethe believes that the person claiming to be “Beloved” is her daughter that she killed 18 years prior.

=== Family relationships ===
Family relationships is an instrumental element of ''Beloved.'' These family relationships help visualize the stress and the dismantlement of African-American families in this era. The slavery system did not allow African-Americans to have rights to themselves, to their family, belongings, and even their children. So, Sethe killing Beloved was deemed a peaceful act because Sethe believed that killing her daughter was saving them.&lt;ref name="Sitter 1992 17–29"/&gt; And by doing this, their family is divided and fragmented, much like the time they were living in. After the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, ex-slave's families were broken and bruised because of the hardships they faced as slaves.

Since slaves could not participate in societal events, they put their faith and trust in the supernatural. They did rituals and pray to their God and most of them believed in a God, or multiple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gorn|first=Elliott J.|date=1984|title=Black Spirits: The Ghostlore of Afro-American Slaves|jstor=2712750|journal=American Quarterly|volume=36|issue=4|pages=549–565|doi=10.2307/2712750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pain ===
The pain throughout this novel is universal because everyone involved in slavery was heavily scarred, whether that be physically, mentally, sociologically, or psychologically. Some of the characters tend to “romanticize” their pain, in a way that each experience is a turning point in one's life. This concept is played throughout history in early Christian contemplative tradition and [[African-American music|African American blues tradition]].

''Beloved'' is a book of the systematic torture that ex-slaves had to deal with after the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. Therefore, in this novel, the narrative is like a complex labyrinth because all the characters have been “stripped away” from their voice, their narrative, their language in a way that their sense of self is diminished. Also, all the characters have had different experiences with slavery, which is why their stories and their narrative are distinct from each other.

In addition to the pain, many major characters try to beautify pain in a way that diminishes what was done. For example, Sethe keeps repeating what a white girl said about her scars on her back, calling them “a Choke-cherry tree. Trunk, branches, and even leaves” (16). She repeats this to everyone, suggesting she is trying to find the beauty in her scar, even when they caused her extreme pain. Paul D and Baby Suggs both look away in disgust and deny that description of Sethe's scars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boudreau|first=Kristin|date=1995|title=Pain and the Unmaking of Self in Toni Morrison's "Beloved"|jstor=1208829|journal=Contemporary Literature|volume=36|issue=3|pages=447–465|doi=10.2307/1208829}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Sethe does the same thing with Beloved. The memory of her ghost-like daughter plays a role of memory, grief and spite that separates Sethe and her late daughter. For instance, Beloved stays in the house with Paul D and Sethe. A home is a place of vulnerability, where the heart lies. Paul D and Baby Suggs both suggest that Beloved is not invited into the home, but Sethe says otherwise because she sees Beloved, all grown and alive, instead of the pain of when Sethe murdered her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jesser|first=Nancy|date=1999|title=Violence, Home, and Community in Toni Morrison's Beloved|jstor=2901282|journal=African American Review|volume=33|issue=2|pages=325–345|doi=10.2307/2901282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major characters ==

=== Sethe ===
Sethe is the protagonist of the novel. She is a freed slave from a plantation called Sweet Home. She lives in the house named 124 (a house on 124 Bluestone Rd. but referred to only as "124") which is believed to be haunted because she killed her infant child. Her two sons have fled because of the haunting and she resides in the house with her daughter Denver. She is motherly and will do anything to protect her children from suffering the same abuses she had as a slave. Sethe is greatly influenced by her repression of the trauma she endured, she lives with "a tree on her back", scars from being whipped. Her character is resilient, yet defined by her traumatic past.

=== Beloved ===
The opaque understanding of Beloved is central to the novel. She is a young woman who mysteriously appears from a body of water near Sethe's house and is discovered soaking wet on the doorstep by Sethe, Paul D, and Denver, on their return from visiting the fair; they take her in. It is widely believed that she is the murdered baby who haunted 124, as the haunting ends when she arrives, and in many ways she behaves like a child. The murdered baby was unnamed, her name is derived from the engraving on Sethe's murdered baby's tombstone, which simply read "Beloved" because Sethe could not afford to engrave the word "Dearly" or anything else. Beloved becomes a catalyst to bring repressed trauma of the family to the surface, but also creates madness in the house and slowly depletes Sethe.

=== Paul D ===
Paul D retains his slave name. All the male slaves at Sweet Home were named Paul, yet he also retains many painful memories of his time as a slave and being forced to live in a [[chain gang]].&lt;ref name="sparknotes.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/beloved/characters.html|title=SparkNotes: Beloved: Character List|website=www.sparknotes.com|language=en|access-date=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that his heart is kept in a "tobacco tin", as he continuously represses his painful memories. Many years after their time together at Sweet Home, Paul D and Sethe reunite and begin a romantic relationship.

=== Denver ===
Denver is the only child of Sethe who is truly present in the novel. She is isolated by other young girls in the community because they fear the haunting of her house. Over the course of the novel Denver fights for her personal independence.

=== Baby Suggs ===
Baby Suggs is the elderly mother of Halle. Halle works to buy her freedom, after which she travels to Cincinnati and establishes herself as a respected leader in the community. She lived in 124 where the majority of the novel takes place in the present time. After Sethe's act of [[infanticide]] Baby Suggs retires to her death bed where she develops an obsession with colors and Sethe inherits the house after her death.

=== Halle ===
Halle is the son of Baby Suggs, the husband of Sethe and father of her children. He and Sethe were married in Sweet Home, yet they got separated during her escape. He is not in the present of the novel, but is mentioned in flashbacks. Paul D was the last to see Halle, churning butter at Sweet Home. It is presumed he went mad after seeing residents of Sweet Home violating Sethe and raping her of her breast milk.

=== schoolteacher ===
schoolteacher is the primary discipliner of the slaves in Sweet Home. His name is intentionally not capitalized throughout the novel. He is the most violent and abusive to the slaves at Sweet Home and eventually comes after Sethe following her escape but is unsuccessful in his attempt to recapture her and her children.&lt;ref name="sparknotes.com"/&gt;

=== Amy Denver ===
Amy Denver is a compassionate, young white girl who finds Sethe desperately trying to make her way to safety after her escape from Sweet Home. Sethe is extremely pregnant at the time, and her feet are bleeding badly from the travel. Amy saves Sethe's life nurturing her back to health. Later, Amy delivers Sethe's daughter on a small boat, and Sethe names the child Denver after her.

==Adaptations==
In 1998, the novel was made into a [[Beloved (1998 film)|film]] directed by [[Jonathan Demme]] and produced by and starring [[Oprah Winfrey]].

In January 2016, ''Beloved'' was broadcast in 10 episodes by [[BBC Radio 4]] as part of its ''[[15 Minute Drama]]'' programme. The radio series was adapted by [[Patricia Cumper]].&lt;ref name="BBC Online"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06tr5t3|title= 15 Minute Drama, Beloved Episode 1 of 10|author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | website= [[BBC Online]] |publisher= | accessdate= January 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Beloved'' received the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120107140306/http://uua.org/giving/awardsscholarships/fredericg./index.shtml Frederic G. Melcher Book Award], which is named for an editor of ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''. In accepting the award on October 12, 1988, Morrison said, "that 'there is no suitable memorial or plaque or wreath or wall or park or skyscraper lobby'" honoring the memory of the human beings forced into slavery and brought to the United States. 'There's no small bench by the road,' she continued. 'And because such a place doesn’t exist (that I know of), the book had to.' Inspired by her remarks, the Toni Morrison Society began to install benches at significant sites in the history of slavery in America. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the first 'bench by the road' was dedicated on July 26, 2008, on [[Sullivan's Island, South Carolina]], the place of entry for some 40 percent of the enslaved Africans brought to the United States. Morrison said she was extremely moved by the memorial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uuworld.org/articles/a-bench-by-road?n= "A bench by the road"], ''UU World'', August 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Felicia R., [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/28/arts/design/28benc.html?st=cse&amp;oref=slogin&amp;scp=2&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin "Bench of Memory at Slavery’s Gateway"], ''The New York Times'', July 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the 21st bench was placed at the [[Library of Congress]]. It is dedicated to [[Daniel Alexander Payne Murray]] (1852–1925), the first African-American assistant librarian of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/nwtonight/item/103447-toni-morrison-to-receive-a-bench-by-the-road-at-the-library-of-congress?linktype=hp_nwt|title=Another 'Bench by the Road' marks African-American history — NewsWorks|last=Heller|first=Dave|website=Newsworks.org|language=en-gb|access-date=April 28, 2017}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel received the seventh annual [[Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights#Book Award|Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights Book Award]] in 1988, given to a novelist who "most faithfully and forcefully reflects Robert Kennedy's purposes - his concern for the poor and the powerless, his struggle for honest and even-handed justice, his conviction that a decent society must assure all young people a fair chance, and his faith that a free democracy can act to remedy disparities of power and opportunity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://rfkcenter.org/who-we-are/awards/rfk-book-awards/book-award-winners/|publisher = Robert F.

===Critical reception===
The publication of ''Beloved'' in 1987 resulted in the greatest acclaim yet for Morrison. Although nominated for the National Book Award, it did not win, and 48 African-American writers and critics — including [[Maya Angelou]], [[Amiri Baraka]], [[Jayne Cortez]], [[Angela Davis]], [[Ernest J. Gaines]], [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]], [[Rosa Guy]], [[June Jordan]], [[Paule Marshall]], [[Louise Meriwether]], [[Eugene Redmond]], [[Sonia Sanchez]], [[Quincy Troupe]], [[John Edgar Wideman]], and [[John A. Williams]] — signed a letter of protest that was published in ''The New York Times Book Review'' on January 24, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, Edwin, [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/19/books/48-black-writers-protest-by-praising-morrison.html "48 Black Writers Protest By Praising Morrison"], ''The New York Times'', January 19, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Troy, [https://aalbc.com/tc/topic/1615-writers-demand-recognition-for-toni-morrison-1988/ "Writers Demand Recognition for Toni Morrison (1988)"], AALBC.com, July 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet later in 1988 ''Beloved'' did receive the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction,&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Randolph, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1988/04/01/morrison-novel-beloved-wins-pulitzer-prize/d3b9e319-1011-4060-9f05-54bba52ed54c/ "Morrison Novel 'Beloved' Wins Pulitzer Prize"], ''The Washington Post'', April 1, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Book Award, the Melcher Book Award, the Lyndhurst Foundation Award, and the Elmer Holmes Bobst Award.&lt;ref name="giroux261"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giroux|first=Christopher|author2=Brigham Narins|title=Beloved by Toni Morrison|journal=Contemporary Literary Criticism|date=1995|volume=87|pages=261–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its popularity and status as one of Morrison's most accomplished novels, ''Beloved'' has never been universally hailed as a success. Some reviewers have excoriated the novel for what they consider its excessive sentimentality and sensationalistic depiction of the horrors of slavery, including its characterization of the slave trade as a Holocaust-like genocide. Others, while concurring that ''Beloved'' is at times overwritten, have lauded the novel as a profound and extraordinary act of imagination. Noting the work's mythic dimensions and political focus, these commentators have treated the novel as an exploration of family, trauma, and the repression of memory as well as an attempt to restore the historical record and give voice to the collective memory of African Americans. Indeed, critics and Morrison herself have indicated that the controversial epigraph to ''Beloved'', "sixty million and more", is drawn from a number of studies on the African slave trade which estimate that approximately half of each ship's "cargo" perished in transit to America.

Scholars have additionally debated the nature of the character Beloved, arguing whether she is actually a ghost or a real person. Numerous reviews, assuming Beloved to be a supernatural incarnation of Sethe's daughter, have subsequently faulted ''Beloved'' as an unconvincing and confusing ghost story. Elizabeth B. House, however, has argued that Beloved is not a ghost, and the novel is actually a story of two probable instances of mistaken identity. Beloved is haunted by the loss of her African parents and thus comes to believe that Sethe is her mother. Sethe longs for her dead daughter and is rather easily convinced that Beloved is the child she has lost. Such an interpretation, House contends, clears up many puzzling aspects of the novel and emphasizes Morrison's concern with familial ties.&lt;ref name="giroux261"/&gt;

Since the late 1970s, there has been a strong focus on Morrison's representation of African-American experience and history. The idea that writing acts as a means of healing or recovery is a strain in many of these studies. Timothy Powell, for instance, argues that Morrison's recovery of a black logos rewrites blackness as "affirmation, presence, and good",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powell|first=Timothy|author2=David Middleton|title=Toni Morrison: The Struggle to Depict the Black Figure on the White Page|journal=Toni Morrison's Fiction: Contemporary Criticism|date=1997|pages=45–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Theodore O. Mason, Jr., suggests that Morrison's stories unite communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mason|first=Theodore O., Jr.|chapter=The Novelist as Conservator: Stories and Comprehension in Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon|editor=Harold Bloom|title=Modern Critical Views Toni Morrison|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|location=New York|date=1990|pages=171–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many critics explore memory, or what ''Beloved''’s Sethe calls "rememory", in this light. Susan Bowers places Morrison in a "long tradition of African American apocalyptic writing" that looks back in time, "unveiling" the horrors of the past in order to "transform" them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowers|first=Susan|title=Beloved and the New Apocalypse|journal=Toni Morrison's Fiction: Contemporary Criticism|date=1997|pages=209–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several critics have interpreted Morrison's representations of trauma and memory through a psychoanalytic framework. Ashraf H. A. Rushdy explores how "primal scenes" in Morrison's novels are "an opportunity and affective agency for self-discovery through memory" and "rememory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rushdy|first=Ashraf|title='Rememory': Primal Scense and Constructions in Toni Morrison's Novels|journal=Toni Morrison's Fiction: Contemporary Criticism|date=1997|pages=135–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Jill Matus argues, however, Morrison's representations of trauma are “never simply curative”: in raising the ghosts of the past in order to banish or memorialize them, the texts potentially “provoke readers to the vicarious experience of trauma and act as a means of transmission".&lt;ref name=Matus&gt;{{cite book|last=Matus|first=Jill|title=Toni Morrison|publisher=Manchester University Press|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ann Snitow's reaction to ''Beloved'' neatly illustrates how Morrison criticism began to evolve and move toward new modes of interpretation. In her 1987 review of ''Beloved'', Snitow argues that Beloved, the ghost at the center of the narrative, is "too light" and "hollow", rendering the entire novel "airless". Snitow changed her position after reading criticism that interpreted ''Beloved'' in a different way, seeing something more complicated and burdened than a literal ghost, something requiring different forms of creative expression and critical interpretation. The conflicts at work here are ideological as well as critical: they concern the definition and evaluation of American and African-American literature, the relationship between art and politics, and the tension between recognition and appropriation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snitow|first=Ann|title=Death Duties: Toni Morrison Looks Back in Sorrow|journal=Toni Morrison: Critical Perspectives Past and Present|date=1993|pages=26–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In defining Morrison's texts as African-American literature, critics have become more attentive to historical and social context and to the way Morrison's fiction engages with specific places and moments in time. As Jennings observes, many of Morrison's novels are set in isolated black communities where African practices and belief systems are not marginalized by a dominant white culture but rather remain active, if perhaps subconscious, forces shaping the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jennings|first=La Vinia Delois|title=Toni Morrison and the Idea of Africa|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matus comments that Morrison's later novels "have been even more thoroughly focused on specific historical moments"; "through their engagement with the history of slavery and early twentieth-century Harlem, [they] have imagined and memorialized aspects of black history that have been forgotten or inadequately remembered".&lt;ref name=Matus /&gt;

===Banning and Controversy===
Beloved has been banned from five U.S. schools since 2007. In 2017, Beloved was considered for removal from the Fairfax County (VA) senior English reading list due to a parent's complaint that “the book includes scenes of violent sex, including a gang rape, and was too graphic and extreme for teenagers”. &lt;ref&gt;Titus, Ron, [http://www.marshall.edu/library/bannedbooks/books/beloved.asp] "Banned Books By Year", July 20, 2017, &lt;/ref&gt; Other common reasons for censorship include bestiality and infanticide. Parental concern about Beloved's content inspired the “Beloved Bill”, legislation that would require Virginia public schools to notify parents of any “sexually explicit content” and provide an alternative assignment if requested.&lt;ref&gt;American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression, [https://ncac.org/incident/coalition-to-virginia-governor-veto-the-beloved-bill] "Coalition to Virginia Governor: Veto the 'Beloved' Bill", March 9, 2016, &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9949">'''Biomimetic antifouling coating'''s are special coatings that prevent the accumulation of marine organisms on a surface.  Typical antifouling coatings are not [[Biomimicry|biomimetic]] but are based on synthetic [[chemical compound]]s that can have deleterious effects on the environment.  Prime examples are [[tributyltin]] compounds, which are components in paints to prevent [[biofouling]] of ship hulls.  Although highly effective at combatting the accumulation of barnacles and other problematic organisms, [[organotin compound|organotin-containing]] paints are damaging to many organisms and have been shown to interrupt marine food chains.&lt;ref&gt;Salta, M., Wharton, J.

==Chemical methods==
Most antifouling coatings are based upon [[chemical compound]]s that inhibit fouling. When incorporated into marine coatings, these [[biocide]]s leech into the immediate surroundings and minimize fouling. The classic synthetic antifouling agent is [[tributyltin]] (TBT).  Natural biocides typically show lower environmental impact but variable effectiveness.

Natural biocides are found in a variety of sources, including [[sponge]]s, algae, [[coral]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, bacteria, and [[tunicate|sea-squirts]],&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chambers |first1=LD |last2=Stokes |first2=KR |last3=Walsh |first3=FC |last4=Wood |first4 =RJK |year=2006 |title=Modern approaches to marine antifouling coatings |journal=Surface and Coatings Technology |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=3642–3652 |doi=10.1016/j.surfcoat.2006.08.129|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0257897206009364 |accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and include toxins, [[anaesthetic]]s, and growth/attachment/[[metamorphosis]]-inhibiting molecules.&lt;ref name=Omae&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Omae |first=Iwao |title=General Aspects of Tin-Free Antifouling Paints |journal=[[Chemical Reviews]] |publisher=[[American Chemical Society]] |year=2003 |volume=103 |issue=9 |pages=3431–3448 |doi=10.1021/cr030669z |url=http://web.centre.edu/workmanj/che%20454%20stuff/antifouling.pdf |accessdate=May 23, 2012|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Natural biocides are typically divided into two categories: [[terpenes]] (often containing unsaturated [[ligand]] groups and electronegative oxygen functional groups) and nonterpenes.

Various [[tannins]] (nonterpene), naturally synthesized by a variety of plants, are effective biocides when combined with copper and zinc salts.&lt;ref name=Bellotti&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bellotti |first1=N |last2=Deya|first2=C |last3=del Amo |first3=B |last4=Romagnoli |first4=R |year=2010 |title=Antifouling Paints with Zinc "Tannate" |journal=Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. |volume=49 |issue=7 |pages=3386–3390 |doi=10.1021/ie9010518 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tannins are able to flocculate with a variety of cations, which then exhibit antiseptic properties. The most effective natural biocide is 3,4-dihydroxybufa-20,22 dienolide, or [[bufalin]] (a steroid of [[bufotoxin|toad poison]] from ''Bufo vulgaris''), which is over 100 times more effective than TBT at preventing biofouling.&lt;ref name=Omae/&gt; Bufalin is however expensive.  A few natural compounds with simpler synthetic routes, such as [[nicotinamide]] or 2,5,6-tribromo-1-methylgramine (from ''Zoobotryon pellucidum''), have been incorporated into patented antifouling paints.&lt;ref name=Omae/&gt;

A significant drawback to biomimetic chemical agents is their modest service life. Since the natural biocides must leech out of the coating to be effective, the rate of leeching is a key parameter.&lt;ref name=leech_rate&gt;{{cite web|title=Emission Scenario Document on Antifouling Products Annex|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/33/37/34707347.pdf|work=Biocides Publications|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \text{Total biocide release} = {  L_\text{a} \times a \times W_\text{a} \times 100 \over\ SVR \times SPG \times DFT}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Where '''L&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the fraction of the biocide actually released (typically around 0.7), '''a''' is the weight fraction of the active ingredient in the biocide, '''DFT''' is the dry film thickness, '''W&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the concentration of the natural biocide in the wet paint, '''SPG''' is the specific gravity of the wet paint, and '''SVR''' is the percentage of dry paint to wet paint by volume.

==Shark skin mimetics==
One class of biomimetic antifouling coatings is inspired by the surface of shark skin, which consists of nanoscale overlapping plates that exhibit parallel ridges that effectively prevent sharks from becoming fouled even when moving at slow speeds.  The antifouling qualities of the shark skin-inspired designs appear highly dependent upon the engineered roughness index (ERI).&lt;ref name=Long&gt;{{cite journal|last=Long|first=C|title=A model that predicts the attachment behavior of Ulva linza zoospores on surface topography|journal=Biofouling|year=2010|volume=26|issue=4|pages=411–419|doi=10.1080/08927011003628849|pmid=20191401|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a919515111&amp;fulltext=713240928|accessdate=6 June 2011|last2=Schumacher|first2=James F.|last3=Robinson|first3=Paul A.C.|last4=Finlay|first4=John A.|last5=Callow|first5=Maureen E.|last6=Callow|first6=James A.|last7=Brennan|first7=Anthony B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; ERI = { r \times n \over 1 - \phi}  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Where '''r''' is the Wenzel roughness ratio, '''n''' is the number of distinct surface features in the design of the surface, and φ is the area fraction of the tops of the distinct surface features. A completely smooth surface would have an ERI = 0.

Using this equation, the amount of microfouling spores per mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be modeled.  Similar to actual shark skin, the patterned nature of Sharklet AF shows microstructural differences in three dimensions with a corresponding ERI of 9.5. This three-dimensional patterned difference imparts a 77% reduction in microfouling settlement.&lt;ref name=Schumacher_1/&gt; Other artificial nonpatterned nanoscale rough surfaces such as 2-μm-diameter circular pillars (ERI = 5.0) or 2-μm-wide ridges (ERI = 6.1) reduce fouling settlement by 36% and 31%, respectively, while a more patterned surface composed of 2-μm-diameter circular pillars and 10-μm equilateral triangles (ERI = 8.7) reduces spore settlement by 58%.&lt;ref name=Schumacher_1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schumacher|first=J|title=Engineered antifouling microtopographies - effect of feature size, geometry, and roughness on settlement of zoospores of the green alga Ulva|journal=Biofouling|year=2007|volume=23|issue=1|pages=55–62|doi=10.1080/08927010601136957|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a776600187|accessdate=7 June 2011|last2=Carman|first2=Michelle L.|last3=Estes|first3=Thomas G.|last4=Feinberg|first4=Adam W.|last5=Wilson|first5=Leslie H.|last6=Callow|first6=Maureen E.|last7=Callow|first7=James A.|last8=Finlay|first8=John A.|last9=Brennan|first9=Anthony B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[contact angle]]s obtained for hydrophobic surfaces are directly related to surface roughnesses by the [[Wenzel]] equation.&lt;ref name = Lotus&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheng |first1=Y |last2=Rodak |first2=D |last3=Wong |first3=C |last4= Hayden|first4=C|title = Effect of micro- and nano-structure on the self-cleaning behaviour of lotus leaves |journal= Nanotechnology| year=2006 |pages=1359–1362 |volume = 17 |issue=5 |doi=10.1088/0957-4484/17/5/032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusions==
Biomimetic antifouling coatings are highly lucrative because of their low environmental impact and demonstrated success. Some properties of a biomimetic antifouling coating can be predicted from the contact angles obtained from the Wenzel equation, and the calculated ERI. Natural materials such as shark skin continue to provide inspiration for scientists to improve the coatings currently on the market.

[[Image:ChimericMouseWithPups.jpg|thumb|A chimeric mouse with its [[offspring]]]]
A '''genetic chimerism''' or '''chimera''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/kɪˈmɪərə/]] or [[Help:IPA/English|/kaɪˈmɪərə/]], also '''chimaera''' (c''himæra'') is a single organism composed of cells with distinct [[genotype]]s. In animals, this means an individual derived from two or more [[zygote]]s, which can include possessing [[blood cell]]s of different [[blood type]]s, subtle variations in form ([[phenotype]]) and, if the zygotes were of differing sexes, then even the possession of both female and male [[sex organs]]&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt; (this is just one of many different ways that may result in [[intersexuality]]). Animal chimeras are produced by the merger of multiple fertilized eggs. In plant chimeras, however, the distinct types of tissue may originate from the same [[zygote]], and the difference is often due to [[mutation]] during ordinary [[cell division]]. Normally, genetic chimerism is not visible on casual inspection; however, it has been detected in the course of proving parentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1=Friedman| first1=Lauren| title=The Stranger-Than-Fiction Story Of A Woman Who Was Her Own Twin| url=http://www.businessinsider.com/lydia-fairchild-is-her-own-twin-2014-2| accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way that chimerism can occur in animals is by [[organ (biology)|organ]] transplantation, giving one individual tissues that developed from a different genome. For example, transplantation of [[bone marrow]] often determines the recipient's ensuing [[blood type]].

==Animals==
An animal chimera is a single [[organism]] that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct [[cell (biology)|cells]] that originated from different [[zygote]]s involved in [[sexual reproduction]]. If the different cells have emerged from the same zygote, the organism is called a [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]]. Chimeras are formed from at least four parent cells (two fertilised eggs or early embryos fused together). Each population of cells keeps its own character and the resulting organism is a mixture of tissues. Cases of human chimerism have been documented.&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt;

This condition is either inherited or it is acquired through the infusion of [[allogeneic]] [[hematopoietic cell]]s during [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] or [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]]. In nonidentical twins, chimerism occurs by means of blood-vessel [[anastomose]]s. The likelihood of offspring being a chimera is increased if it is created via [[in vitro fertilization|in vitro fertilisation]].&lt;ref name="Strain" /&gt; Chimeras can often breed, but the fertility and type of offspring depends on which cell line gave rise to the ovaries or testes; varying degrees of [[intersex]] differences may result if one set of cells is genetically female and another genetically male.

===Tetragametic chimerism===
Tetragametic chimerism is a form of congenital chimerism. This condition occurs through the fertilisation of two separate ova by two sperm, followed by aggregation of the two at the [[blastocyst]] or zygote stages. This results in the development of an organism with intermingled cell lines. Put another way, the chimera is formed from the merging of two [[twin|nonidentical twins]] (a similar merging presumably occurs with identical twins, but as their genotypes are not significantly distinct, the resulting individual would not be considered a chimera). As such, they can be male, female, or have mixed intersex characteristics.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As the organism develops, it can come to possess [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s that have different sets of [[chromosome]]s. For example, the chimera may have a [[liver]] composed of cells with one set of chromosomes and have a [[kidney]] composed of cells with a second set of chromosomes. This has occurred in humans, and at one time was thought to be extremely rare, though more recent evidence suggests that it is not the case.&lt;ref name=Norton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=Aaron|author2=Ozzie Zehner|title=Which Half Is Mommy?: Tetragametic Chimerism and Trans-Subjectivity|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|year=2008|volume=Fall/Winter|pages=106–127|url=https://ucdavis.academia.edu/AaronTNorton/Papers/126923/Which_Half_Is_Mommy_Tetragametic_Chimerism_and_Trans-Subjectivity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boklage, C.E. How New Humans Are Made. Hackensack, NJ; London: World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd; 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

This is particularly true for the [[marmoset]]. Recent research shows most marmosets are chimeras, sharing DNA with their [[fraternal twin]]s.&lt;ref name="Ross2007" /&gt; 95% of marmoset fraternal twins trade blood through [[chorionic]] fusions, making them [[hematopoietic]] chimeras.&lt;ref name="Masahito Tachibana, Michelle Sparman and Shoukhrat Mitalipov"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=cell|title=Generation of Chimeric Rhesus Monkeys| author=Masahito Tachibana, Michelle Sparman and [[Shoukhrat Mitalipov]]| date=January 2012| pmc=3264685| pmid=22225614| doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.12.007| volume=148| pages=285–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=N.| last1=Gengozian| last2=Batson| first2=JS| first3=P.| last3=Eide| title=Hematologic and Cytogenetic Evidence for Hematopoietic Chimerism in the Marmoset, Tamarinus Nigricollis| journal=Cytogenetics| year=1964| volume=10| pages=384–393.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most chimeras will go through life without realizing they are chimeras. The difference in phenotypes may be subtle (''e.g.'', having a [[Thumb#Variations|hitchhiker's thumb]] and a straight thumb, eyes of slightly different colors, differential hair growth on opposite sides of the body, etc.) or completely undetectable. Chimeras may also show, under a certain spectrum of UV light, distinctive marks on the back resembling that of arrow points pointing downwards from the shoulders down to the lower back; this is one expression of pigment unevenness called [[Blaschko's lines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=75| title=2 ) In the chimera episode, the fact that the [subject] was a chimera was first established through a camera flash on the skin illuminating skin anomalies...| work=Ask a Geneticist| publisher=[[Stanford University School of Medicine|Stanford School of Medicine]]| author= Barry Starr | deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724035334/http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=75 |archivedate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affected persons may be identified by the finding of two populations of red cells or, if the zygotes are of opposite sex, [[ambiguous genitalia]] and intersex alone or in combination; such persons sometimes also have patchy skin, hair, or [[eye pigmentation]] ([[heterochromia]]). If the blastocysts are of opposite sex, [[Sex organ#Genitals|genitals]] of both sexes may be formed: either [[ovary]] and [[testis]], or combined [[ovotestes]], in one rare form of intersex, a condition previously known as ''[[true hermaphroditism]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Note that the frequency of this condition does ''not'' indicate the true prevalence of chimerism. Most chimeras composed of both male and female cells probably do not have an intersex condition, as might be expected if the two cell populations were evenly blended throughout the body. Often, most or all of the cells of a single cell type will be composed of a single cell line, i.e. the blood may be composed predominantly of one cell line, and the internal organs of the other cell line. Genitalia produce the hormones responsible for other sex characteristics. 

Natural chimeras are almost never detected unless they exhibit abnormalities such as male/female or hermaphrodite characteristics or uneven skin pigmentation. The most noticeable are some male [[tortoiseshell cat|tortoiseshell]]s and [[calico cat|calico]]s (although most male tortoiseshells have an extra X chromosome responsible for the colouration) or animals with ambiguous sex organs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The existence of chimerism is problematic for DNA testing, a fact with implications for family and criminal law. The [[Lydia Fairchild]] case, for example, was brought to court after DNA testing apparently showed that her children could not be hers. Fraud charges were filed against her and her custody of her children was challenged. The charge against her was dismissed when it became clear that Lydia was a chimera, with the matching DNA being found in her cervical tissue.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Another case was that of '''Karen Keegan''', who was also suspected (initially) of not being her children's biological mother, after DNA tests on her adult sons for a kidney transplant she needed seemed to show she was not their mother.&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.five.tv/programmes/extraordinarypeople/twininside/ |title=The Twin Inside Me: Extraordinary People |publisher=[[Five (TV channel) |Channel 5 TV, UK]] |date=9 March 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526105634/http://www.five.tv/programmes/extraordinarypeople/twininside/ |archivedate=May 26, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tetragametic state has important implications for organ or [[stem cell]] transplantation. Chimeras typically have [[immunologic tolerance]] to both cell lines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Microchimerism===
{{Main| Microchimerism}}

Microchimerism is the presence of a small number of cells that are genetically distinct from those of the host individual. Most people are born with a few cells genetically identical to their mothers' and the proportion of these cells goes down in healthy individuals as they get older. People who retain higher numbers of cells genetically identical to their mothers' have been observed to have higher rates of some autoimmune diseases, presumably because the immune system is responsible for destroying these cells and a common immune defect prevents it from doing so and also causes autoimmune problems.
The higher rates of autoimmune diseases due to the presence of maternally-derived cells is why in a 2010 study of a 40-year-old man with scleroderma-like disease (an autoimmune rheumatic disease), the female cells detected in his blood stream via FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) were thought to be maternally-derived. However, his form of microchimerism was found to be due to a vanished twin, and whether or not microchimerism from a vanished twin might predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases as well is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bellefon | first1 = L. | last2 = Heiman | first2 = P. | last3 = Kanaan | first3 = S. | last4 = Azzouz | first4 = D. | last5 = Rak | first5 = J. | last6 = Martin | first6 = M. | last7 = Roudier | first7 = J. | last8 = Roufosse | first8 = F. | last9 = Lambert | first9 = C. | year = 2010 | title = Cells from a vanished twin as a source of microchimerism 40 years later | url = | journal = Chimerism | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 56–60 | doi=10.4161/chim.1.2.14294| pmc = 3023624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women often also have a few cells genetically identical to that of their children, and some people also have some cells genetically identical to that of their siblings (maternal siblings only, since these cells are passed to them because their mother retained them).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Symbiotic chimerism in anglerfish===
Chimerism occurs naturally in adult [[Ceratiidae|Ceratioid]] [[anglerfish]] and is in fact a natural and essential part of their life cycle. Once the male achieves adulthood, it begins its search for a female. Using strong [[olfactory|olfactory (or smell)]] receptors, the male searches until it locates a female anglerfish. The male, less than an inch in length, bites into her skin and releases an enzyme that digests the skin of both his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. While this attachment has become necessary for the male's survival, it will eventually consume him, as both anglerfish fuse into a single [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] individual. Sometimes in this process more than one male will attach to a single female as a symbiote. They will all be consumed into the body of the larger female angler. Once fused to a female, the males will reach sexual maturity, developing large [[testicle]]s as their other organs [[atrophy]]. This process allows for sperm to be in constant supply when the female produces an egg, so that the chimeric fish is able to have a greater number of offspring.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ceratiidae]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germline chimerism===
Germline chimerism occurs when the germ cells (for example, [[sperm]] and [[ovum|egg]] cells) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own. It has recently been discovered that [[marmoset]]s can carry the reproductive cells of their (fraternal) twin siblings, because of placental fusion during development. (Marmosets almost always give birth to fraternal twins.)&lt;ref name="Ross2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ross| first=C. N.|author2=J. A. French | author3=G.

===Research===
In biological research, chimeras are artificially produced by selectively transplanting embryonic cells from one organism onto the embryo of another, and allowing the resultant blastocyst to develop. Chimeras are not [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], which form from the fusion of [[gametes]] from two species that form a single [[zygote]] with a combined genetic makeup. Nor are they [[Hybridoma technology|Hybridomas]], which, as with hybrids, result from the fusion of two species' cells into a single cell and artificial propagation of this cell in the laboratory. Essentially, in a chimera, each cell is from either of the parent species, whereas in a hybrid and hybridoma, each cell is derived from both parent species. "Chimera" is a broad term and is often applied to many different mechanisms of the mixing of cells from two different species.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As with cloning, the process of creating and implanting a chimera is imprecise, with the majority of embryos spontaneously terminating. Successes, however, have led to major advancements in the field of embryology, as creating chimeras of one species with different physical traits, such as colour, has allowed researchers to trace the differentiation of embryonic cells through the formation of organ systems in the adult individual.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The first known primate chimeras are the rhesus monkey twins, Roku and Hex, with each having six genomes. They were created by mixing cells from [[totipotent]] four cell blastocysts; although the cells never fused they worked together to form organs. It was discovered that one of these primates, Roku, was a sexual chimera; as four percent of Roku's blood cells contained two x chromosomes.&lt;ref name="Masahito Tachibana, Michelle Sparman and Shoukhrat Mitalipov"/&gt;

A major milestone in chimera experimentation occurred in 1984, when a chimeric [[sheep-goat chimera|geep]] was produced by combining [[embryo]]s from a [[goat]] and a [[sheep]], and survived to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921546,00.html | title = It's a Geep | publisher = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 27 February 1984 | accessdate = 4 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the "geep" revealed several complexities to chimera development. In implanting a goat embryo for gestation in a sheep, the sheep's immune system would reject the developing goat embryo, whereas a "geep" embryo (sharing markers of immunity with both sheep and goats) was able to survive implantation in either of its parent species.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In August 2003, researchers at the [[Shanghai Second Medical University]] in China reported that they had successfully fused human skin cells and [[rabbit]] ova to create the first human chimeric embryos. The embryos were allowed to develop for several days in a laboratory setting, then destroyed to harvest the resulting [[stem cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/01/0125_050125_chimeras.html| title=Animal-Human Hybrids Spark Controversy| last=Mott| first=Maryann| date=January 25, 2005| work=National Geographic News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, scientists at the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] School of Medicine created a sheep whose blood contained 15% human cells and 85% sheep cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=3995&amp;sectionid=3510208 |title=Iranian scientist creates sheep with half-human organs |date=27 Mar 2007 |work=[[Press TV]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114210217/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=3995&amp;sectionid=3510208 |archivedate=November 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mice===
Chimeric mice are important animals in biological research, as they allow the investigation of a variety of biological questions in an animal that has two distinct genetic pools within it. These include insights into such problems as the tissue specific requirements of a gene, cell lineage, and cell potential.
The general methods for creating chimeric mice can be summarized either by injection or aggregation of embryonic cells from different origins. The first chimeric mouse was made by Beatrice Mintz in the 1960s through the aggregation of eight-cell-stage embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mintz | first1 = B. | last2 = Silvers | first2 = W. K. | title = "Intrinsic" Immunological Tolerance in Allophenic Mice | journal = Science | volume = 158 | issue = 3807 | pages = 1484–6 | year = 1967 | doi = 10.1126/science.158.3807.1484 |pmid=6058691 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Injection on the other hand was pioneered by Richard Gardner and Ralph Brinster who injected cells into blastocysts to create chimeric mice with germ lines fully derived from injected [[embryonic stem cells]] (ES cells).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0168-9525(86)90161-7 | last1 = Robertson | first1 = EJ | year = 1986 | title = Pluripotential stem cell lines as a route into the mouse germ line | url = | journal = Trends Genet | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 9–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chimeras can be derived from mouse embryos that have not yet implanted in the uterus as well as from implanted embryos. ES cells from the inner cell mass of an implanted blastocyst can contribute to all cell lineages of a mouse including the germ line. ES cells are a useful tool in chimeras because genes can be mutated in them through the use of [[homologous recombination]], thus allowing [[gene targeting]]. Since this discovery occurred in 1988, ES cells have become a key tool in the generation of specific chimeric mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.85.22.8583 | last1 = Doetschman | first1 = T. | last2 = Maeda | first2 = N. | last3 = Smithies | first3 = O. | year = 1988 | title = Targeted mutation of the Hp gene in mouse embryonic stem cells | url = | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. | volume = 85 | issue = 22| pages = 8583–8587 | pmid = 3186749 | pmc = 282503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Underlying biology====
The ability to make mouse chimeras comes from an understanding of early mouse development. Between the stages of fertilization of the egg and the implantation of a blastocyst into the uterus, different parts of the mouse embryo retain the ability to give rise to a variety of cell lineages. Once the embryo has reached the blastocyst stage, it is composed of several parts, mainly the [[trophectoderm]], the [[inner cell mass]], and the [[primitive endoderm]]. Each of these parts of the blastocyst gives rise to different parts of the embryo; the inner cell mass gives rise to the embryo proper, while the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm give rise to extra embryonic structures that support growth of the embryo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0004.2005.00478.x | last1 = Ralston | first1 = A | last2 = Rossant | first2 = J | year = 2005 | title = Genetic regulation of stem cell origins in the mouse embryo | url = | journal = Clin Genet | volume = 68 | issue = 2| pages = 106–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two- to eight-cell-stage embryos are competent for making chimeras, since at these stages of development, the cells in the embryos are not yet committed to give rise to any particular cell lineage, and could give rise to the inner cell mass or the trophectoderm. In the case where two diploid eight-cell-stage embryos are used to make a chimera, chimerism can be later found in the [[epiblast]], primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm of the mouse [[blastocyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1242/dev.00893 | last1 = Tam | first1 = P.L. | last2 = Rossant | first2 = J. | year = 2003 | title = Mouse embryonic chimeras: tools for studying mammalian development | url = | journal = Development | volume = 130 | issue = 25| pages = 6155–6163 | pmid = 14623817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rossant | first1 = J. | year = 1976 | title = Postimplantation development of blastomeres isolated from 4- and 8-cell mouse eggs | url = | journal = J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 283–290 | pmid = 1033982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to dissect the embryo at other stages so as to accordingly give rise to one lineage of cells from an embryo selectively and not the other. For example, subsets of blastomeres can be used to give rise to chimera with specified cell lineage from one embryo. The Inner Cell Mass of a diploid blastocyst for example can be used to make a chimera with another blastocyst of eight-cell diploid embryo; the cells taken from the inner cell mass will give rise to the primitive endoderm and to the epiblast in the chimera mouse.&lt;ref&gt;Pappaioannou, V., R. Johnson. (1993). Production of chimeras and genetically defined offspring from targeted ES cells. In Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach (ed. A.Joyner) IRL Press at Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
From this knowledge, [[ES cell]] contributions to chimeras have been developed. ES cells can be used in combination with eight-cell-and two-cell-stage embryos to make chimeras and exclusively give rise to the embryo proper. Embryos that are to be used in chimeras can further be genetically altered in order to specifically contribute to only one part of chimera. An example is the chimera built off of ES cells and tetraploid embryos, which are artificially made by electrofusion of two two-cell diploid embryos. The tetraploid embryo will exclusively give rise to the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm in the chimera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0014-4827(85)90143-0 | last1 = Kubiak | first1 = J | last2 = Tarkowski | first2 = A. | year = 1985 | title = Electrofusion of mouse blastomeres.

Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach (Joyner, A, ed.) IRL Press at Oxford University, Oxford, UK&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methods of production====
There are a variety of combinations that can give rise to a successful chimera mouse and — according to the goal of the experiment — an appropriate cell and embryo combination can be picked; they are generally but not limited to diploid embryo and ES cells, diploid embryo and diploid embryo, ES cell and tetraploid embryo, diploid embryo and tetraploid embryo, ES cells and ES cells. The combination of embryonic stem cell and diploid embryo is a common technique used for the making of chimeric mice, since gene targeting can be done in the embryonic stem cell. These kinds of chimeras can be made through either aggregation of stem cells and the diploid embryo or injection of the stem cells into the diploid embryo. If embryonic stem cells are to be used for gene targeting to make a chimera, the following procedure is common: a construct for homologous recombination for the gene targeted will be introduced into cultured mouse embryonic stem cells from the donor mouse, by way of electroporation; cells positive for the recombination event will have antibiotic resistance, provided by the insertion cassette used in the gene targeting; and be able to be positively selected for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.17.8804 | last1 = Jasin | first1 = M | last2 = Moynahan | first2 = ME | last3 = Richardson | first3 = C | year = 1996 | title = Targeted transgenesis | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 93 | issue = 17| pages = 8804–8808 | pmid = 8799106 | pmc = 38547 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0958067000021059 | last1 = Ledermann | first1 = B | year = 2000 | title = Embryonic Stem Cell and Gene Targeting | url = | journal = Experimental Physiology | volume = 85 | issue = 6| pages = 603–613 | pmid = 11187956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ES cells with the correct targeted gene are then injected into a diploid host mouse blastocyst. These injected blastocysts are then implanted into a pseudo pregnant female surrogate mouse, which will bring the embryos to term and give birth to a mouse whose germline is derived from the donor mouse's ES cells.&lt;ref&gt;Chimera Mouse production by blastocyst injection, Wellcome trust Sanger Institute, http://www.eucomm.org/docs/protocols/mouse_protocol_1_Sanger.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This same procedure can be achieved through aggregation of ES cells and diploid embryos, diploid embryos are cultured in aggregation plates in wells where single embryos can fit, to these wells ES cells are added the aggregates are cultured until a single embryo is formed and has progressed to the blastocyst stage, and can then be transferred to the surrogate mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tanaka | first1 = M | last2 = Hadjantonakis | first2 = AK | last3 = Nagy | first3 = A | title = Aggregation chimeras.

==Plants==

===Structure===
The distinction between sectorial, mericlinal and periclinal '''plant chimeras''' are widely used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z5LwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+plastids:+their+chemistry,+structure,+growth+and+inheritance&amp;dq=The+plastids:+their+chemistry,+structure,+growth+and+inheritance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=38m0Tee4O8ns0gHR0JGWCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA '' The plastids: their chemistry, structure, growth and inheritance''], 2nd edition,1978, Elsevier/ North-Holland, Amsterdam, {{ISBN|0-444-80022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=c0JLPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Mutation+breeding+techniques+and+behavior+of+irradiated+shoot+apices+of+potato&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=18q0TYacDajg0gGp9b31CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA '' Mutation breeding techniques and behavior of irradiated shoot apices of potato''], 1978, Pudoc, Wageingen&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graft chimeras===
{{Main|Graft-chimaera}}
[[File:Taxus-mosaic1.JPG|thumb| [[Taxus]] mosaic.]]
These are produced by grafting genetically different parents, different [[cultivar]]s or different species (which may belong to different genera). The tissues may be partially fused together following [[grafting]] to form a single growing organism that preserves both types of tissue in a single shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Norris, R. |author2=Smith, R.H. |author3=Vaughn, K.C. |last-author-amp=yes| title=Plant chimeras used to establish de novo origin of shoots | journal=Science | year=1983 | pages=75–76 | volume=220 | doi=10.1126/science.220.4592.75 | issue=4592 | pmid=17736164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the constituent species are likely to differ in a wide range of features, so the behavior of their [[periclinal]] chimeras is like to be highly variable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9rxMGwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Plant+Chimeras&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fCO6Te3DEoKutweGpaC3AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ ''Plant Chimeras''], 1st edition, 1992, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-42787-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first such known chimera was probably the [[Bizzaria]], which is a fusion of the [[Florentine citron]] and the [[sour orange]]. Well-known examples of a graft-chimera are [[+Laburnocytisus 'Adamii'|''Laburnocytisus'' 'Adamii']], caused by a fusion of a ''[[Laburnum]]'' and a [[Broom (shrub)|broom]], and "Family" trees, where multiple varieties of apple or pear are grafted onto the same tree. Many fruit trees are cultivated by grafting the body of a sapling onto a [[rootstock]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Chromosomal chimeras===
These are chimeras in which the layers differ in their [[chromosome]] constitution. Occasionally chimeras arise from loss or gain of individual chromosomes or chromosome fragments owing to [[cell division|misdivision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thompson, J.D. |author2=Herre, E.A. |author3=Hamrick, J.L. |author4=Stone, J.L. |last-author-amp=yes| title= Genetic Mosaics in strangler Fig Trees: Implication for Tropical Conservation | journal=Science | year=1991 | pages=1214–1216 | volume=254 | issue=5035 | doi= 10.1126/science.254.5035.1214 | pmid=17776412}}&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly cytochimeras have simple multiple of the normal chromosome complement in the changed layer. There are various effects on cell size and growth characteristics.

===Nuclear gene-differential chimeras===
These chimeras arise by spontaneous or induced mutation of a nuclear gene to a dominant or recessive allele. As a rule one character is affected at a time in the leaf, flower, fruit, or other parts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Plastid gene-differential chimeras===
These chimeras arise by spontaneous or induced mutation of a plastid gene, followed by the sorting-out of two kinds of plastid during vegetative growth. Alternatively, after selfing or [[nucleic acid thermodynamics]], plastids may sort-out from a mixed egg or mixed zygote respectively. This type of chimera is recognized at the time of origin by the sorting-out pattern in the leaves. After sorting-out is complete, periclinal chimeras are distinguished from similar looking nuclear gene-differential chimeras by their [[mendelian inheritance|non-mendelian inheritance]]. The majority of variegated-leaf chimeras are of this kind.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

All plastid gene- and some nuclear gene-differential chimeras affect the color of the plasmids within the leaves, and these are grouped together as [[chlorophyll]] chimeras, or preferably as variegated leaf chimeras. For most variegation, the mutation involved is the loss of the [[chloroplast]]s in the mutated tissue, so that part of the plant tissue has no green pigment and no [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] ability. This mutated tissue is unable to survive on its own but is kept alive by its partnership with normal photosynthetic tissue. Sometimes chimeras are also found with layers differing in respect of both their nuclear and their plastid genes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Origins===
There are multiple reasons to explain the occurrence of plant chimera during plant recovery stage:

(1) The process of shoot [[organogenesis]] starts form the multicellular origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhu, X. |author2=Zhao, M. |author3=Ma, S. |author4=Ge, Y. |author5=Zhang, M. |author6=Chen, L. |last-author-amp=yes| title=Induction and origin of adventitious shoots from chimeras of Brassica juncea and Brassica oleracea | journal=Plant Cell Rep | year=2007 | pages=1727–1732 | volume=26 | issue=10 | doi=10.1007/s00299-007-0398-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(2) The endogenous tolerance leads to the ineffectiveness of the weak selective agents.

(3) A self-protection mechanism (cross protection). Transformed cells serve as guards to protect the untransformed ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Park SH, Rose SC, Zapata C, Srivatanakul M | title= Cross-protection and selectable marker genes in plant transformation. | journal= In Vitro Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology - Plant| year=1998 | pages=117–121 | volume=34 | issue=2 | doi= 10.1007/BF02822775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

(4) The observable characteristic of transgenic cells may be a transient expression of the marker gene. Or it may due to the presence of agrobacterium cells.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Detection===
Untransformed cells should be easy to detect and remove to avoid chimeras. Because it’s extremely important to maintain the stable ability of the transgenic plants across different generations. Reporter genes such as [[GUS reporter system|GUS]] and [[Green Fluorescent Protein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rakosy-Tican, E. |author2=Aurori, C.M. |author3=Dijkstra, C. |author4=Thieme, R. |author5=Aurori, A. |author6=Davey, M.R. |last-author-amp=yes | title=The usefulness of the gfp reporter gene for monitoring Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of potato dihaploid and tetraploid genotypes | journal=Plant Cell Rep | year=2007 | pages=661–671 | volume=26 | issue=5 | doi=10.1007/s00299-006-0273-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;(GFP) are utilized in combination with plant selective markers (herbicide, antibody etc.) However, GUS expression depends on the plant development stage and GFP may be influenced by the green tissue autofluorescence. [[Quantitative PCR]] could be an alternative method for chimera detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Faize, M., Faize, L. and Burgos, L. | title=Using quantitative real-time PCR to detect chimeras in transgenic tobacco and apricot and to monitor their dissociation | journal=BMC Biotechnology | year=2010 | pages=53 | volume=10 | issue=1 | doi=10.1186/1472-6750-10-53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and legislation==
{{See also|Bioethics}}

===Ethics===
The US and Western Europe have strict codes of ethics and regulations in place that expressly forbid certain subsets of experimentation using human cells, though there is a vast difference in the regulatory framework.&lt;ref&gt;Futehally, Ilmas, Beyond Biology, [[Strategic Foresight Group]] [http://www.strategicforesight.com/inner-articles.php?id=77#.UyZHJ1GSxv0]&lt;/ref&gt; Through the creation of human-chimera comes the question: where does society now draw the line of humanity? This question poses serious legal and moral issues, along with creating controversy. Chimpanzees, for example, are not offered any legal standing, and are put down if they pose a threat to humans. If a chimpanzee is genetically altered to be more similar to a human, it may blur the ethical line between animal and man. Legal debate would be the next step in the process to determine whether certain chimera should be granted legal rights.&lt;ref name="Defining Humanity"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Bruch| first1=Quinton| title=Defining Humanity: The Ethics of Chimeric Animals and Organ Growing |url=http://triplehelixblog.com/2014/02/defining-humanity-the-ethics-of-chimeric-animals-and-organ-growing/| website=The Triple Helix Online| accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with issues regarding the rights of chimera, individuals have expressed concern whether or not creating human-chimera diminishes the dignity of being human.&lt;ref name="Human Chimera Prohibition Act"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Brownback| first1=Samuel| title=S.659 – Human Chimera Prohibition Act of 2005 (Introduced in Senate - IS)| url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:S.659:| website=The Library of Congress THOMAS| accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
{{anchor|Chimera_(genetics)#Legislation}}&lt;!-- linked from [[Human Chimera Prohibition Act]] --&gt;In May 2008, a robust debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] on the ethics of creating chimeras with human stem cells led to the decision that embryos would be allowed to be made in laboratories, given that they would be destroyed within the first 14 days.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

On 11 July 2005, a bill, The Human Chimera Prohibition Act, was introduced into the [[United States Congress]] by Senator 
[[Samuel Brownback]]; however, it died in Congress sometime in the next year. The bill was introduced based on the findings that science has progressed to the point where the human and nonhuman species can be merged to create new forms of life. Because of this, serious ethical issues arise as this blurs the line between humans and other animals, and according to the bill with this blurring of the lines comes a show of disrespect for human dignity. The final claim brought up in The Human Chimera Prohibition Act was that there is an increasing amount of zoonotic diseases and the creation of human-animal chimeras can allow these diseases to reach humans.&lt;ref name="Human Chimera Prohibition Act"/&gt; Since the bill's death in congress, there has not been another attempt at setting regulations on chimera research in the United States.

{{Campaignbox Coal Wars}}

The '''Columbine Mine massacre''', sometimes called the '''Columbine massacre''', occurred in 1927, in the town of [[Serene, Colorado]]. A fight broke out between Colorado [[State police (United States)|state police]] and a group of [[strike action|striking]] [[coal mine]]rs, during which the unarmed [[miner]]s were attacked with firearms. The miners testified that [[machine gun]]s were fired at them, which the state police disputed.  Six strikers were killed, and dozens were injured.

== Background ==
The [[company town]] of [[Serene, Colorado]], nestled on a rolling hillside, was the home of the Columbine mine. The [[Strike action|strike]] was five weeks old and strikers had been conducting morning rallies at Serene for two weeks, for the Columbine was one of the few coal mines in the state to remain in operation. On November 21, 1927, five hundred miners, some accompanied by their wives and children, arrived at the north gate just before dawn. They carried three 
[[Flag of the United States|Flags of the United States]]. At the direction of [[Josephine Roche]], daughter of the recently- deceased owner of the [[Rocky Mountain Fuel Company]], the picketers had been served [[coffee]] and [[doughnut]]s on previous mornings.

That morning, the recently-disbanded state police, also known as the [[Colorado Rangers]], were recalled to duty and would meet the picketers  and bar their path.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The miners were surprised to see men dressed in civilian clothes, but armed with [[machine pistol]]s, [[rifle]]s, [[riot gun]]s and [[tear gas]] grenades. The Rangers were backed up by rifle-toting mine guards stationed on the mine dump. The Head of the Rangers, [[Louis Scherf]], shouted to the strikers, "Who are your leaders?" "We're all leaders!" came the reply. Scherf announced that the strikers would not be allowed into the town, and for a few moments the strikers hesitated outside the fence. There was discussion, with many of the strikers asserting their right to proceed. Serene had a public post office, they argued, and some of their children were enrolled in the school in Serene. One of the Rangers was reported to have taunted, "If you want to come in here, come ahead, but we'll carry you out."

Strike leader Adam Bell stepped forward and asked for the gate to be unlocked. As he put his hand on the gate, one of the Rangers struck him with a [[Club (weapon)|club]]. A sixteen-year-old boy stood nearby and was holding one of the flags. The banner was snatched from him, and in the [[tug of war]] that followed, the [[Flag#Flagpoles|flagpole]] broke over the fence. The miners rushed toward the gate, and suddenly the air was filled with tear gas launched by the police. A tear gas grenade hit Mrs. Kubic in the back, as she tried to get away. Some of the miners threw the tear gas grenades back.

The miners in the front of the group scaled the gate, led by Adam Bell's call of "Come on!" Bell was pulled down by three policemen. Viciously clubbed on the head, he fell unconscious to the ground. A battle raged over his prostrate form, the miners shielding him from the Rangers. Mrs. Elizabeth Beranek, mother of 16 children and one of the flag-bearers, tried to protect him by thrusting her flag in front of his attackers. The police turned on her, bruising her severely. Rangers reportedly seized Mrs. Beranek's flag too.

Police admitted to using clubs in the skirmish. In Scherf's words, "We knocked them down as fast as they came over the gate." Miners would later say that the clubs were lengths of gas pipe. A striker belted one Ranger in the face, [[Nasal fracture|breaking his nose]]. A [[pocketknife]]-wielding miner cut another on the hand, while other strikers [[Stone throwing|pelted the Rangers with rocks]]. Blood gushed from a cut above one Ranger's eye, when a rock found its mark. The police then retreated.

==Massacre==
Enraged, the strikers forced their way through the wooden gate. Jerry Davis grabbed one of the fallen flags, as hundreds of angry miners surged through the entrance. Others scaled the fence east of the gate. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The police retreated, forming two lines at the water tank; {{convert|120|yard|metres}} inside the fence. Louis Scherf fired two .45 caliber rounds over the heads of the strikers. His men responded with deadly fire directly into the crowd. The miners scattered. Twelve remained on the ground: some dead, some injured. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

At least two, and possibly three [[machine gun]]s were available at the mine. Miners later claimed that their ranks were decimated by a withering crossfire from the mine tipple &amp;ndash; a structure where coal was loaded onto railroad cars &amp;ndash; and from a gun on a truck near the water tank. John Eastenes, 34, of Lafayette, married and father of six children, died instantly. Nick Spanudakhis, 34, of Lafayette, lived only a few minutes. Frank Kovich of Erie, Rene Jacques, 26, of Louisville and 21-year-old Jerry Davis died hours later in the hospital. The Flag of the United States Davis carried was riddled with seventeen bullet holes and stained with blood. Mike Vidovich of Erie, 35, died a week later of his injuries. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Aftermath==
The state police later testified that they had not used machine guns in the fight. The miners and some witnesses testified that machine guns were used. Some witnesses identified a mine guard who had climbed the tipple and may have operated the machine gun mounted there, providing one possible explanation for the discrepancy in testimony. However, the machine gun near the watertank was reportedly manned by one of Scherf's men.&lt;ref&gt;''Once A Coalminer...

(2018). Suppress to feel and remember less: Neural correlates of explicit and implicit emotional suppression on perception and memory. ''Neuropsychologia'', {{doi|10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.02.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coping planning interventions are effective when people are supported in the process of forming coping plans.&lt;ref&gt;Kwasnicka, D., Presseau, J., White, M., &amp; Sniehotta, F. F. (2013). Does planning how to cope with anticipated barriers facilitate health-related behaviour change?

==Approach==
Coping planning aims to meet the needs of people who ask for help with distress, including suicidal ideation.&lt;ref name="stallman 2017"/&gt; By addressing ''why'' someone asks for help, the focus stays on what the person needs rather than on what the helper wants to do. It provides an alternative to the widely used, but non-evidence-based risk-assessment approach to [[suicide prevention]].&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, J. C., Ribeiro, J. D., Fox, K. R., Bentley, K. H., Kleiman, E. M., Huang, X., et al. (2017). Risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors: A meta-analysis of 50 years of research. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 143(2), 187–232 {{doi|10.1037/bul0000084}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Needs assessment]] and support focuses on the individual needs of each person. They are rated as low (coping independently), moderate (may need additional low-intensity professional support), or high (needs immediate high-intensity professional support).&lt;ref name="stallman 2017" /&gt;

==Applications==
In addition to suicide prevention training for health professionals, coping planning has been used to train journalists, and to help a range of people cope better, including carers, university students, and with children to improve [[emotional regulation]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===In suicide prevention===
Coping planning is designed to contribute to [[suicide prevention]] in a number of ways. Firstly, it provides a framework to support people whenever they [[Help-seeking|seek help]], rather than waiting until they are considered high-risk for death by suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Stallman, H. M. (2017). Meeting the needs of patients who have suicidal thoughts presenting to Emergency Departments. ''Emergency Medicine Australasia'', 29(6), 749. {{doi|10.1111/1742-6723.12867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, it aims to focus on helping people to cope, rather than to stay safe from suicide, which, according to [[ironic process theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Wegner, Daniel M. (1989). ''White Bears and Other Unwanted Thoughts: Suppression, Obsession, and the Psychology of Mental Control''. Viking. {{ISBN|978-0670825226}}.&lt;/ref&gt; makes it more likely that people will think about suicide. Healthy coping strategies improve overall wellbeing&lt;ref&gt;Stallman, H. M., Ohan, J. L., &amp; Chiera, B. (2018). The role of social support, being present, and self-kindness in university student wellbeing. ''British Journal of Guidance and Counselling'', 46(4), 365–374. {{doi|10.1080/03069885.2017.1343458}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reduce distress.&lt;ref&gt;Stallman, H. M., Ohan, J. L., &amp; Chiera, B. (2018). The role of social support, being present, and self-kindness in university student psychological distress. ''Australian Psychologist'', 53(1), 52–59. {{doi|10.1111/ap.12271}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach is designed for use in both low (e.g., [[psychological first aid]]ers or [[Telephone counseling|telephone helplines]]) and high intensity services (e.g., [[emergency department]]s or [[inpatient care]] units).

{{Disability}}
'''Disability hate crime''' is a form of [[hate crime]] arising from the hostility of the perpetrator towards the [[disability]], or perceived disability, of the victim, or because of their perceived connection to disability. It is often viewed politically as a logical extreme of [[ableism]] (sometimes known in the UK by the disputed word "disablism"), carried through into criminal acts against the person. This phenomenon can take many forms, from [[verbal abuse]] and [[intimidation|intimidatory behaviour]] to [[vandalism]], [[assault]], or even [[murder]]. Disability hate crimes may take the form of one-off incidents, or may represent systematic abuse which continues over periods of weeks, months or even years.

Disability hate crime may occur between strangers who have never met, between acquaintances or within the family. The two key requirements for an act to be called a "disability hate crime" are that it is motivated in part or whole by prejudice against someone because of disability; and second, that the act is actually a crime.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sherry (2010) "Disability Hate Crimes: Does Anyone Really Hate Disabled People?" Ashgate, London&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition==
[[Ken Macdonald|Sir Ken Macdonald, QC]], the then [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales]] stated in a speech to the [[Bar Council]] in October 2008 that "I am on record as saying that it is my sense that disability hate crime is very widespread. I have said that it is my view that at the lower end of the spectrum there is a vast amount not being picked up. I have also expressed the view that the more serious disability hate crimes are not always being prosecuted as they should be. This is a scar on the conscience of criminal justice. And all bodies and all institutions involved in the delivery of justice, including my own, share the responsibility." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/disability_hate_crime_/#a16|title=Error 404 (page not found): The Crown Prosecution Service|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal status==
In the [[United States of America|United States]], the ''[[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]]'' of 2009 expanded the [[Hate crimes in the United States#Federal prosecution of hate crimes|1969 United States federal hate-crime law]] to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived disability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/10/28/obama-signs-billion-defense-policy/ Obama Signs Defense Policy Bill That Includes 'Hate Crime' Legislation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030123045/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/10/28/obama-signs-billion-defense-policy/ |date=2009-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], disability hate crime is regarded as an aggravating factor under Section 146 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], allowing a heavier tariff to be used in sentencing than the crime might draw without the hate elements. Section 146 states that the sentencing provisions apply if:
:(a) that, at the time of committing the offence, or immediately before or after doing so, the offender demonstrated towards the victim of the offence hostility based on—
::(i) the sexual orientation (or presumed sexual orientation) of the victim, or
::(ii) a disability (or presumed disability) of the victim, or
:(b) that the offence is motivated (wholly or partly)—
::(i) by hostility towards persons who are of a particular sexual orientation, or
::(ii) by hostility towards persons who have a disability or a particular disability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030044_en_14#pt12-ch1-pb1-l1g145 Sections 145 and 146 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003].&lt;/ref&gt;

The test in Section 146 is deliberately one for evidence of 'hostility' rather than 'hatred' as the seriousness of the offence was considered to justify the application of a less-strict test.

== Crime recording ==
The historical failure of police forces, prosecutors and some social care organizations to treat disability hate crime as a serious issue, an echo of previous failures over other forms of hate crime, particularly racial and [[Violence against LGBT  people|LGBT-focused hate crimes]], has led to chronic under-reporting. This under-reporting is both pre-emptive, through a widespread belief within the disabled community that they will not be treated seriously by law enforcement, and post-facto, where police forces investigate the crime as non hate-based and record it as such.

The UK [[Crown Prosecution Service]]'s Annual Hate Crime Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/disability.html|title=The CPS : Disability hate crime|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that 11,624 cases of racial or religious hate crime were prosecuted in England and Wales in 2009 with 10,690 leading to successful convictions. By contrast only 363 prosecutions and 299 convictions were for disability hate crimes.

The UK charity [[Scope (charity)|Scope]] has conducted research into the prevalence and experience of disability hate crime, summarizing their findings and those of other disability groups in the report ''Getting Away With Murder'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.scope.org.uk/About-Us/Research-and-Policy/Publication-directory/Getting-away-with-murder&lt;/ref&gt;  Katharine Quarmby, who wrote the report and was the first British journalist to investigate disability hate crime, has also written a book on the matter.&lt;ref name=Quarmby&gt;Quarmby, Katharine. "Scapegoat: Why we are failing disabled people." ''Portobello'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perceived vulnerability ==
The treatment of disability hate crimes has been affected by the perception of disabled people as inherently [[vulnerability|vulnerable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-16/young-victim-blaming-at-its-very-worst/5745346|title=Disability and murder: victim blaming at its very worst|work=ABC News|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a multi-faceted issue. Unfounded application of the 'vulnerable' label to a disabled person is considered a form of infantilization, a type of ableism in which disabled people are regarded as childlike, rather than as functioning adults.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} 

Perceptions of [[social vulnerability|vulnerability]] can also lead to the perception that the victim is partially or entirely responsible for the crime. For example, a disabled person may be perceived as having been at fault due to being alone after dark, i.e. engaged in risky behaviour. This pattern of [[victim blaming]] has also appeared in the prosecution of rape and other sexual crimes.

On the other hand, it has been suggested that the vulnerability of victims is a key factor in all crimes. It has been applied to wide variety of scenarios, including people working at night or handling large amounts of money.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sherry (2010) Disability Hate Crimes: Does anyone really hate disabled people? Ashgate, London&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown Prosecution Service has issued guidance to its prosecutors reminding them that 'vulnerable' should only be used as a description of a person within the precise legal meaning of the term - for instance, as defined in section 16 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/disability_hate_crime_ Guidance on the distinction between vulnerability and hostility in the context of crimes committed against disabled people&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernesto Balmaceda Bello''' (1887 – February 24, 1906) was a Chilean diplomat, who was murdered in Belgium in a celebrated case that came to define diplomatic privileges and immunities for the retinue and families of diplomatic staff. He was of [[Basque people|Basque]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;http://html.rincondelvago.com/historia-de-chile_6.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], the son of [[José Rafael Balmaceda|José Rafael Balmaceda Fernández]] and of Ana Bello Codesido. By birth, he was the son of a former [[Ministry of the Interior (Chile)|Minister of the Interior]], great-grandson of [[Andrés Bello]] and nephew to President [[José Manuel Balmaceda]]. After completing his secondary studies, he joined the Chilean Foreign Service and in 1905 was appointed secretary of the Chilean consulate to Belgium.

==The murder==
His immediate superior at the consulate in [[Brussels]] was [[charge d'affaires]] Don Luis Waddington, who had two children: Adelaida and [[Carlos Waddington|Carlos]]. Soon after his arrival, Balmaceda started to court Adelaide and shortly thereafter, the parents of the bride-to-be found out that the young couple already had had sexual intercourse. They then demanded that 19-year-old Ernesto become engaged to Adelaide and "redress the wrong done" to her.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1907/06/25/archives/diplomats-son-on-trial-for-murder-justification-for-killing-by.html ''The New York Times'', June 25, 1907]&lt;/ref&gt; He admitted his error and accepted the engagement for the time being.

Balmaceda did not want to get married, so he wrote to his family to have himself immediately transferred to another embassy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1907/06/30/archives/diplomats-son-defends-crime-waddington-pleads-unwritten-law-in.html ''The New York Times'', June 30, 1907]&lt;/ref&gt; His family connections managed his transfer to the embassy in the United States, but before he could depart the news leaked, and 16-year-old Carlos Waddington, brother of his bride-to-be started to practice target-shooting in the embassy gardens under his window. Ernesto Balmaceda panicked and on February 24, 1906, the day when the engagement was to be publicly announced at an embassy banquet, he hid in his rooming-house, with his friend Javier Rengifo. Carlos visited him and demanded that he honor his word. When Balmaceda refused, he shot him three times: once in the heart, once in the chest and once in the head.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1907/07/03/archives/waddington-case-ready-for-jury-evidence-closed-and-the-prosecutor.html ''The New York Times'', July 3, 1907]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carlos_Waddington.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;small&gt;[[Carlos Waddington]] during his trial in 1907&lt;/small&gt;]]
After the murder, Carlos Waddington fled to the Chilean embassy and claimed [[diplomatic immunity]] and [[extraterritoriality]]. The Belgian people were incensed at this behavior and surrounded the embassy, bent on capturing Waddington. The police had to establish a constant cordon in order to prevent the mob from violating the building and [[lynching]] him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1906/02/26/archives/lynchers-besiege-legation-brussels-mobs-threaten-the-chilean.html ''The New York Times'', February 26, 1906]&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2, Chile waived its rights and ordered Waddington to be handed over to the Belgian police to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1906/03/03/archives/gives-up-diplomats-son-chile-waives-her-rights-in-the-brussels.html ''The New York Times'', March 3, 1906]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the trial happened, public opinion had shifted in Waddington's favor, and he was viewed as the avenger of his sister's honor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1907/07/05/archives/sympathy-for-waddington-people-demand-his-acquittal-trial-may.html ''The New York Times'', July 5, 1907]&lt;/ref&gt; After a very short trial, he was acquitted on July 6, 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1907/07/06/archives/waddington-acquitted-women-kiss-the-avenger-of-his-sister-as-he.html ''The New York Times'', July 6, 1907]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5576">The '''gargoyle''' is a [[fantasy]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[monster]] inspired by the [[gargoyle]] architectural element. While they were believed in mythology to frighten away evil spirits, the idea of such statues physically coming to life was a more recent notion. Like [[golem]]s, they are usually made of [[Magic in fiction|magically]] animated or transformed stone, but have animal or [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]] traits, and are often guardians of a place such as a [[cathedral]] or [[castle]].&lt;ref name="Kythera of Anevern 2009 p. 24" /&gt; They can also be depicted as vessels for demonic possession, or as a living species resembling statues.&lt;ref name="Weinstock 2016" /&gt;

== Description ==

=== Evil constructs ===
The notion of gargoyles as supernatural constructs brought to life by evil was introduced in ''Maker of Gargoyles'' (1932) by [[Clark Ashton Smith]], where Reynard, a medieval [[Stonemasonry|stonemason]], unconsciously infuses his hate and lust into two gargoyles that attack the town of Vyones and later kill him when he attempts to destroy them.&lt;ref name="Weinstock 2016" /&gt; In the novelette ''[[Conjure Wife]]'' (1943) by [[Fritz Leiber|Fritz Lieber]], a dragon sculpture is animated by a witch and sent to kill an archaeology professor.&lt;ref name="Weinstock 2016" /&gt;

Such gargoyles also entered science fiction, such as in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode [[The Dæmons|''The Daemons'']] (1971).&lt;ref name="Weinstock 2016" /&gt;

=== Demonic vessels ===
The notion of gargoyles as demonic vessels was introduced in ''The Horn of Vapula'' (1932), where a demon familiar is bound into a horned and goatlike gargoyle.&lt;ref name="Weinstock 2016" /&gt; Gargoyles appear as horned canine statues in ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984), where they are possessed by the demonic spirits of Zuul and Vinz Klortho.&lt;ref name="Weinstock 2016" /&gt; Gargoyles also appear as vessels for formerly human souls, such as the [[Marvel Comics]] hero [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]], who later becomes able to transform back into a human.&lt;ref name="Weinstock 2016" /&gt;

=== Fictional races ===
The movie ''Gargoyles'' (1972) was the first to present gargoyles as a fictional race as opposed to solitary creatures, depicting them as being created by [[Satan]] to harry mankind.&lt;ref name="Sipos 2010 p. 127" /&gt; A species of [[Gargoyle (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Gargoyles]] also exists in ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''.&lt;ref name="Slavicsek Baker 2005 p. 307" /&gt; Movies featuring races of gargoyle-like creatures include ''Gargoyle'' (2004) and ''[[Rise of the Gargoyles]]'' (2009), where the creatures can lay eggs and turn into statues to blend in.&lt;ref name="Weinstock 2016" /&gt;

=== Friendly gargoyles ===
The notion of a friendly gargoyle was created by the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] show ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' (1994–1997), in which gargoyles battle monsters to protect humanity. It originates from the folk belief of gargoyles as protectors.&lt;ref name="Weinstock 2016" /&gt; Friendly gargoyles also appear in the [[Discworld (world)|''Discworld'' universe]], such as [[Constable Downspout]] in ''[[Feet of Clay (novel)|Feet of Clay]]'' (1996), and in Disney's ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1996), as Hugo, Victor and Laverne, who embody [[Quasimodo]]'s subconscious.&lt;ref name="Weinstock 2016" /&gt;

== In popular culture ==
* [[Animatronics|Animatronic]] gargoyle statues are a popular [[Halloween]] or [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted attraction]] commodity.&lt;ref name="Camille 2008 p. 343" /&gt;

==Objectives==
Gemini 10 established that radiation at high altitude was not a problem. After docking with their [[Agena target vehicle|Agena]] booster in low orbit, Young and Collins used it to climb temporarily to {{convert|763.8|km|nmi|disp=flip}}. After leaving the first Agena, they then met with the dead, drifting Agena left over from the aborted [[Gemini 8]] flight—thus executing the program's first double rendezvous. With no electricity on board the second Agena, the rendezvous was accomplished with eyes only—no radar. After the rendezvous, Collins spacewalked over to the dormant Agena at the end of a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} tether, making Collins the first person to meet another spacecraft in orbit. He retrieved a cosmic dust-collecting panel from the side of the Agena, but was not able to take any pictures; in the complicated business of keeping his tether clear of the Gemini and Agena, his Hasselblad camera worked itself free and drifted away.

Gemini 10 was designed to achieve the objectives planned for the last two missions—[[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]], docking and [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]]. As well as this it was also hoped to dock with the [[Agena Target Vehicle]] from the Gemini 8 mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1966-066A|title=Gemini 10|publisher=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Agena's battery power had failed many months earlier and this would demonstrate the ability to rendezvous with a passive object. It would be also the first mission to fire the Agena's own rocket, allowing them to reach higher orbits.

==Flight==
The Agena launched perfectly for the second time, after problems had occurred with the targets for Gemini 6 and 9. Gemini 10 followed 100 minutes later and entered a {{convert|159.9|by|268.9|km|nmi|adj=on|sp=us|disp=flip}} orbit. They were {{convert|1800|km|nmi|sp=us|disp=flip}} behind the Agena. Two anomalous events occurred during the launch. At liftoff, a propellant fill umbilical became snared with its release lanyard. It ripped out of the LC-19 service tower and remained attached to the second stage during ascent. Tracking camera footage also showed that the first stage oxidizer tank dome ruptured after staging and released a cloud of [[nitrogen tetroxide]]. The telemetry package on the first stage had been disabled at staging, so visual evidence was the only data available. Film review of Titan II ICBM launches found at least seven other instances of post-staging tank rupture, most likely caused by flying debris, second stage engine exhaust, or structural bending. NASA finally decided that this phenomenon did not pose any safety risk to the astronauts and no corrective action had to be taken.

===First rendezvous===
Collins discovered that he was unable to use the sextant for navigation as it did not seem to work as expected. At first he mistook airglow as the real horizon when trying to make some fixes on stars. Then the image didn't seem right. He tried another instrument that they had on board but this was not practical to use as it had a very small field of view.

They had a backup in the form of the computers on the ground. They made their first burn to put them into a {{convert|265|by|272|km|nmi|adj=on|sp=us|disp=flip}} orbit. However Young didn't realize that during the next burn, he had the spacecraft turned slightly, which meant that they introduced an out-of-plane error. This meant two extra burns were necessary, and by the time they had docked with the Agena, 60% of their fuel had been consumed. It was decided to keep the Gemini docked to the Agena as long as possible, as this would mean that they could use the fuel on board the Agena for attitude control.

The first burn of the Agena engine lasted 80 seconds and put them in a {{convert|294|by|763|km|nmi|adj=on|sp=us|disp=flip}} orbit. This was the highest a person had ever been, although the record was soon surpassed by [[Gemini 11]], which went to over {{convert|1000|km|nmi|sp=us|disp=flip}}. This burn was quite a ride for the crew. Because the Gemini and Agena docked nose-to-nose, the forces experienced were "eyeballs out" as opposed to "eyeballs in" for a launch from Earth. The crew took a couple of pictures when they reached [[apogee]] but were more interested in what was going on in the spacecraft &amp;mdash; checking the systems and watching the radiation dosage meter.

After this they had their sleep period which lasted for eight hours and then they were ready for another busy day. The crew's first order of business was to make a second burn with the Agena engine to put them into the same orbit as the Gemini 8 Agena. This was at 20:58 UTC on July 19 and lasted 78 seconds and took {{convert|105|m/s|ft/s|sp=us|disp=flip}} off their speed, putting them into a {{convert|294|by|382|km|nmi|adj=on|sp=us|disp=flip}} orbit. They made one more burn of the Agena to circularize their orbit to {{convert|377.6|km|nmi|sp=us|disp=flip}}.

===EVA 1===
It was now time for the first of two EVAs on Gemini 10. This was to be just a standup EVA, where Collins would stand in the open hatch and take some photographs of stars as part of experiment S-13. They used a 70&amp;nbsp;mm general purpose camera to image the southern [[Milky Way Galaxy|Milky Way]] in ultraviolet. After orbital sunrise, Collins then photographed a color plate on the side of the spacecraft (MSC-8) to see whether film reproduced colors accurately in space. They reentered the spacecraft six minutes early when they both found their eyes were irritated, which was caused by a minor leak of [[lithium hydroxide]] in the astronauts' oxygen supply.&lt;ref name=collins&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Michael|title=Carrying the Fire: An Astronaut's Journeys|date=1974|publisher=Cooper Square Press|isbn=9781461660880|type=ebook|chapter=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After repressurizing the cabin, they ran the oxygen at high rates and flushed the environment system.

After the exercise of the EVA Young and Collins slept in their second 'night' in space. The next 'morning' they started preparing for the second rendezvous and another EVA.

===Second rendezvous===
After undocking from their Agena, the crew thought they sighted the Gemini 8 Agena. It however turned out to be their own Agena {{convert|5.5|km|nmi|sp=us|disp=flip}} away, while their target was {{convert|176|km|nmi|sp=us|disp=flip}} away. It wasn't until just over {{convert|30|km|nmi|disp=flip}} away that they saw it as a faint star. After a few more correction burns, they were station-keeping {{convert|10|ft|m|sp=us}} away from the Gemini 8 Agena. They found the Agena to be very stable and in good condition.

===EVA 2===
At 48 hours and 41 minutes into the mission, the second EVA began. Collins' first task was to retrieve a Micrometeorite Collector (S-12) from the side of the spacecraft. This he accomplished with some difficulty (similar to that encountered by [[Eugene Cernan]] on [[Gemini 9A]]). However, the collector floated out of the cabin some time later during the EVA and was lost.

He next traveled over to the Agena and tried to grab onto the docking cone but found this impossible as it was smooth and had no grip. Collins used a [[nitrogen]]-propelled [[Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit]] (HHMU) to move himself towards the Gemini and then back to the Agena. This time he was able to grab hold of some wire bundles and retrieved the Micrometeorite Collector (S-10) from the Agena. He decided against replacing it as he could lose the one he had just retrieved.

His last task on this EVA was to test out the HHMU. However this stopped working and meant they finished the EVA after only 39 minutes. During this time, it took the crew eight minutes to close the hatch as they had some difficulty with the {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} umbilical. It was jettisoned along with the chestpack used by Collins an hour later when they opened the hatch for the third and final time.

===Experiments===
There were ten other experiments that the crew performed during the mission. Three were interested in radiation: MSC-3 was the Tri-Axis Magnetometer which measured levels in the [[South Atlantic Anomaly]]. There was also MSC-6, a [[Beta particle|beta]] [[spectrometer]], which measured potential radiation doses for Apollo missions, and MSC-7, a [[bremsstrahlung]] spectrometer which detected [[radiation flux]] as a function of energy when the spacecraft passed through the South Atlantic Anomaly.

S-26 investigated the ion and electron wake of the spacecraft. This provided limited results due to the lack of fuel for attitude control, but found that electron and ion temperatures were higher than expected and it registered shock effects during docking and undocking.

The S-5 and S-6 experiments were performed, which were previously carried on Gemini 9A; these were Synoptic Terrain and Synoptic Weather photography respectively. There was also S-1 which was intended to image the [[Zodiacal light]]. All of these experiments were of little use as the film used was only half as sensitive as Gemini 9A and the dirty windows lowered the transmission of light by a factor of six.

The crew also tried to perform D-5, a navigation experiment. They were only able to track five stars, with six needed for accurate measurements. The last experiment, D-10, was to investigate an ion-sensing attitude control system. This experiment measured the attitude of the spacecraft from the flow of ions and electrons around the spacecraft in orbit. The results from this experiment showed the system to be accurate and responsive.

===Re-entry===
[[File:Gemini 10 Splashdown - GPN-2000-000995.jpg|thumb|left|Splashdown of Gemini 10.]]

The last day of the mission was short and retrofire came at 70 hours and 10 minutes into the mission. They landed only {{convert|5.6|km|nmi|sp=us|disp=flip}} away from the intended landing site and were recovered by {{USS|Guadalcanal|LPH-7|6}}.

The Gemini 10 mission was supported by the following U.S. Department of Defense resources; 9,067 personnel, 78 aircraft and 13 ships.

The patch is simple in design but highly symbolic. The main feature is a large X with a Gemini and Agena orbiting around it. The two stars have a variety of meanings: the two rendezvous attempts, Castor and Pollux in Gemini or the two crew members. This is one of the few crew patches without the crew's name. It is able to be displayed "upside down" but is correctly shown with the spacecraft to the right. It was designed by Young's first wife, Barbara.

==Spacecraft location==
For many years the spacecraft was the centerpiece of a space exhibition at [[Norsk Teknisk Museum]], [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]. It was returned on request in 2002.

The spacecraft is currently on display at the [[Cosmosphere]] in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]].

'''Gertrude Bleiberg''' was an American visual artist. Encouraged by [[Jay DeFeo]], who recognized her talent, Bleiberg started working as an artist at the age of 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/16249/late-blooming-artist-gertrude-bleiberg-dies-in-palo-alto/ | title=Late-blooming artist Gertrude Bleiberg dies in Palo Alto | work=Jweekly.com | date=24 August 2001 | accessdate=23 July 2015 | author=Goldsmith, Aleza}}&lt;/ref&gt; She earned a BFA and MFA degrees from the [[San Francisco Art Institute]] and developed a unique expressionist style, most notable for monumental depiction of the details of her domestic life: family, home, and friends. In a 25-year retrospective catalog of her work, Fred Martin, former Dean of the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], noted that Bleiberg shows "that the direct experience of seeing may itself be alive, vivid, and recreated to amuse, to baffle, to give-yes-joy."

== Early life ==

Gertrude Bleiberg was born in New York City in 1921. In 1937 her family moved to Los Angeles. After marrying Donald J. Bleiberg, MD in 1942, she moved to [[Quincy, California]], where Gertrude was a teacher and Donald was a [[family practitioner]] and operated the Plumas Industrial Hospital. The Bleibergs raised four daughters in Quincy.

In 1965, Bleiberg moved to [[Palo Alto, California]], where Donald practiced [[emergency medicine]] with [[Kaiser Permanente]] in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]]. The Bleibergs began to travel widely, and Gertrude journaled and sketched during the trips.

In 1969 Bleiberg enrolled in a [[continuing education]] art class, taught by Jay DeFeo, who recognized her innate talent and insisted that Bleiberg pursue professional art training. She went on to get a BFA (1975) and MFA (1977) degrees from the San Francisco Art Institute, where she was the oldest student among the young [[bohemianism|bohemian]] crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last3=Boyle|first3=Prill|title=Defying Gravity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qk4B6EMtaI4C&amp;pg=PA246&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=gertrude+bleiberg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u527rxJpO3&amp;sig=DlgUTOSEphl-bzkaDwWR4UAdOhU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCWoVChMI_4iJkLf0xgIViFuICh3vnw6x#v=onepage&amp;q=gertrude%20bleiberg&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|publisher=Emmis Books|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her teachers were [[Manuel Neri]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], and [[Robert Colescott]].

== Career ==

Bleiberg's prints and paintings have been exhibited in numerous museums and corporate collections, including the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Oakland Museum of California]], the [[San Jose Museum of Art]], Mills College Art Museum,  the [[Brooklyn Museum]], and the [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] Archives Collection. In 1996, a 25-year retrospective of her work was held at four galleries in the [[Bay Area]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gertrude-Bleiberg-Retrospective-1970-1996/dp/B00DF87IHW|title=Gertrude Bleiberg: Retrospective 1970-1996|last=Bleiberg|first=Gertrude}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1992, she was given the Women's Caucus for Art, South Bay Chapter, Lifetime Achievement award.

Bleiberg's drawings, prints, and paintings reference the self-taught artist practices. Eccentric line quality, active surfaces, and distorted figures playfully engage with the "naïve" and "primitive" styles. Yet her unique style is consciously cultivated through many years of outstanding professional training and studio work. Her style most closely compares in the history of post-war American art to that of [[Alice Neel]].

'''Gregory Duncan''' "'''Don'''" '''Cameron''' ({{circa|1894}} – July 11, 1952) was an [[United States|American]] [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse trainer]] who trained [[Count Fleet]], who won the [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|U.S. Triple Crown]] in 1943.

A native of [[California]], Don Cameron served as an aviator in the [[United States Military]] during [[World War I]]. Working in the Thoroughbred horse racing industry, he trained for various owners including the prominent stables of Vera S. Bragg  and J. Shirley Riley. However, he is best known for his time with [[Stoner Creek Stud]] training the horses for its owners, [[John D. Hertz|John &amp; Fannie Hertz]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,772138,00.html?promoid=googlep&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in September 1940 Don Cameron trained [[Challedon]] for owner [[William L. Brann]] and won the [[Pimlico Special]] and [[Havre de Grace Handicap]]. He left Brann's employ in February 1941 and the horse's training was taken over by L. T. (Whitey) Whitehill.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1941/02/05/archives/challedon-works-for-new-trainer-whitehill-supplants-cameron-in.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Count Fleet and the Triple Crown==
In 1939, he hired jockey [[Johnny Longden]] to ride the horses owned by Vera S. Bragg  and Fannie Hertz. With Longden riding [[Count Fleet]] in all his races, in 1942 Don Cameron conditioned Mrs. Hertz's two-year-old colt to [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding 2-Year-Old Male Horse|U.S. Champion 2-Yr-Old Colt]] honors. The following year the colt won the [[Kentucky Derby]], [[Preakness Stakes]] and [[Belmont Stakes]] to become only the 6th U.S. Triple Crown Champion in the history of the [[American Classic Races]]. Cameron would see his colt voted the 1943 [[American Horse of the Year]], the most prestigious honor for Thoroughbred runners in the United States.

Among Cameron's other important horses was [[Vulcan's Forge (horse)|Vulcan's Forge]], whose conditioning he took over in 1949 from [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|U.S. Racing Hall of fame]] trainer, [[Syl Veitch]]. That year, Cameron saddled Vulcan's Forge to major wins in California's richest race, the [[Santa Anita Handicap]] and on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], the [[Suburban Handicap]] at [[New York (state)|New York's]] [[Belmont Park]].

In 1950, Don Cameron's trainee, [[Miche (horse)|Miche]], notably won the La Sorpresa Handicap at [[Santa Anita Park]], ending [[Citation (horse)|Citation's]] sixteen-race win streak

Don Cameron died on July 11, 1952 at age fifty-eight from a [[coronary thrombosis]].

{{Anabaptist vertical}}
'''Hans Hut''' (c. 1490{{snd}}6 December 1527) was a very active [[Anabaptist]] in [[southern Germany]] and [[Austria]].

==Life==
Hut was born in [[Haina, Hildburghausen|Haina]] near [[Römhild]], south [[Thuringia]] and became a travelling bookseller. Hut was for some years [[sacristan]] in [[Bibra, Schmalkalden-Meiningen|Bibra]] to the knight Hans [[Bibra family|von Bibra]] (the brother of Bishop [[Lorenz von Bibra]]).  He early came under the influence of [[Thomas Müntzer]] and, refusing to have his child baptized, was driven from the community in 1524.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Henry Newman . ''A manual of Church history ''. American Baptist Publication Society, 1903, page 161&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in the decisive battle of Thuringia during the [[German Peasants' War]] on 15 May 1525 at [[Bad Frankenhausen]]. About a week later at Bibra, Hut preached "subjects should murder all the authorities, for the opportune time has arrived." In his later years Hut distanced himself from Müntzer, saying that he (himself) "had clearly erred" and that he "had not understood him (Müntzer)."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, George Huntston. The Radical Reformation, 3rd Edition. Truman State Univ Press, 2000. p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; After the battle he managed to flee and traveled throughout the region.

On [[Pentecost]] 1526 he was [[Believer's baptism|baptized]] in Augsburg by [[Hans Denck]], who had previously been baptized by [[Balthasar Hubmaier]]. Some feel that Hut and Denck taught [[Universal salvation]],&lt;ref&gt;Charles Steven Seymour. ''A Theodicy of Hell''. Springer. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; but others question whether this was so.&lt;ref&gt;[[Morwenna Ludlow]], The Journal of Ecclesiastical History (2004), Cambridge University Press – "Why Was Hans Denck Thought to Be a Universalist?&lt;/ref&gt;  He expected the 1528 coming of the [[Kingdom of God]] in the form of a violent [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] imposition of the rule of [[Christ]]. Therefore he curtailed his extensive missionary activity to await Pentecost 1528 and be among the [[144,000|144,000 elect]]. He baptised not only with water, but sealed the baptism with a sign of the cross on the forehead.

His mission activity extended from the Thuringian-French border in the north to [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and [[Moravia]] and in his mission journeys he often seemed to seek former Peasants' War participants. His preaching was strongly influenced by [[Thomas Muentzer|Thomas Muentzer's]] mysticism. Gottfried Sebaß, an expert on Hut's biography and theology, calls him simply "Muentzer's heir."  

In May 1527, [[Hans Schlaffer]] and others joined Hut in a notable theological controversy taking place in [[Mikulov]] (Czech) [[:de:Mikulov|Nikolsburg]] (German), in [[Moravia]], present day Czech Republic.  Unfortunately, the exact subject of the debate has been lost to history, but it may have involved the question of whether or not a committed Christian could hold a job, e.g. as a soldier, in which he would be required to use violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Nicolsburg Articles: A Problem of Early Anabaptist History | author = Robert Friedmann | journal = Church History | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | date = December 1967 | pages = 391–409 | doi=10.2307/3163068}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 1527 Hans Hut was a key participant at the [[Martyrs' Synod]] in [[Augsburg]], a gathering of 60 Anabatists from the surrounding region, trying to come to a common understanding about various teachings. When the Augsburg town council learned of the meeting, they attempted to arrest the group. Hut was arrested along with the major Augsburg Anabaptists. Though the arrest did not end Hut's teaching, after a trial he and the others were sentenced to indefinite imprisonment. Hans Hut was tortured horribly, and accidentally died as a result of a fire which caused his [[asphyxiation]] in the Augsburg prison on 6 December 1527. The next day, the authorities sentenced his dead body to death and burned him.

Hut is the author of [[Ausbund]] no. 8, “O Thou Almighty Lord and God” (O Allmächtiger Herr Gott) which is still in the hymnal used today by North American [[Amish]] congregations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anabaptistvision.org/Songs/Ausbund_8.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henhenet''' was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian queen consort, a lower ranking wife of Pharaoh [[Mentuhotep II]] of the [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|11th dynasty]]. Her tomb (DBXI.11) and small decorated chapel were found in her husband's [[Deir el-Bahari]] temple complex,&lt;ref name="D88"&gt;Dodson, Aidan, Hilton, Dyan. The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-05128-3}} (2004), p.88&lt;/ref&gt; behind the main building, along with the tombs of five other ladies, [[Ashayet]], [[Kawit (queen)|Kawit]], [[Kemsit]], [[Sadeh (queen)|Sadeh]] and [[Mayet (ancient Egypt)|Mayet]]. Most of them were priestesses of [[Hathor]], so it is possible that they were buried there as part of the goddess's cult, but it is also possible that they were the daughters of nobles the king wanted to keep an eye upon.

Unlike the sarcophagi of the other queens, hers was not decorated, only a single line of inscription runs on both sides. Her mummy shows that she died in childbirth.&lt;ref name="G30"&gt;Grajetzki, Wolfram. Ancient Egyptian Queens: A Hieroglyphic Dictionary. London: Golden House Publications. {{ISBN|0-9547218-9-6}} (2005), p.30&lt;/ref&gt; Her mummy is now in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]], her sarcophagus is in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="D88" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/544207 Sarcophagus of the Hathor Priestess Henhenet].

Metropolitan Museum of Arts, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her titles were: King's Beloved Wife ''(ḥmt-nỉswt mrỉỉ.t=f ),'' King's Ornament ''(ẖkr.t-nỉswt),'' King's Sole Ornament ''(ẖkr.t-nỉswt wˁtỉ.t),'' Priestess of Hathor ''(ḥm.t-nṯr ḥwt-ḥrw).''&lt;ref name="G30" /&gt;

==Definition==

Home invasion as such is not defined as a crime in most countries other than the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Home Invasion (definition in Australia) |url=http://www.ocsar.sa.gov.au/docs/information_bulletins/IB11.pdf |date=c. 2000 |accessdate=December 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with offenders being charged according to the actual crimes committed once inside the building, such as [[armed robbery]], [[rape]] or [[murder]]. In English law, offenders who commit burglary while carrying a weapon can be convicted of the offence of [[Burglary_in_English_law#Aggravated_burglary|aggravated burglary]] even if the weapon is not actually brandished or used.

Home invasion differs from [[burglary]] in that its perpetrators have a violent intent apart from the unlawful entry itself, specific or general, much the same way as aggravated robbery—personally taking from someone by force—is differentiated from mere [[larceny]] (theft alone).

==Incidence==
Few statistics are available on the crime of home invasion as such, because it is not defined as a crime in its own right in most jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;Byron, Reginald; William Molidor; Andrew Cantu (2018). "US Newspapers' Portrayals of Home Invasion Crime". The Howard Journal of Crime and Justice. 57(2): 250-277.  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hojo.12257 &lt;/ref&gt; Statistics about home invasion found on the Internet are often false or  misleading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeinvasionnews.com/?p=797 |title=If You See These Home Invasion Statistics, Don’t Look. |publisher=Home Invasion News |date=June 29, 2011 |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persons arrested for what the police or media may refer to as "home invasion" are actually charged with crimes such as robbery, [[kidnapping]], [[homicide]], rape, or assault.

==Terminology and home invasion as a crime==
The first published use of the term "home invasion" recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is an article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on 1 February 1912,&lt;ref&gt;OED, 4th ed 2004: 1912 Washington Post 1 Feb. 4/3 (heading) Child Bureau wins. Senate passes bill after prohibiting home invasion.&lt;/ref&gt; with an article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on 18 March 1925 clearly indicating the modern meaning.&lt;ref&gt;OED, 4th ed 2004: 1925 Los Angeles Times 18 Mar.  ii. 11/1 (heading) Trio hunted in home invasion. Woman reports attack on twin daughters.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Home-invasion robberies" were highlighted in June 1995, when the term appeared in the cover story of ''The [[FBI]] Law Enforcement Bulletin'' in an article written by Police Chief James T. Hurley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbfl.us/index.aspx?NID=153 |title=Fernandina Beach, FL – Official Website – Home Invasion |publisher=Fbfl.us |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, area, later republished on bNet, the online blog posted by Harvard Business School. Hurley posited that, at the time, the crime could be considered an alternative to bank or convenience store robberies, which were becoming more difficult to carry out due to technological advances in security. In the same article Hurley recommended educating the public about home invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2194/is_n6_v64/ai_17312586/?tag=mantle_skin;content |title=Violent crime hits home: home invasion robbery &amp;#124; FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin,The &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |accessdate=November 20, 2011 |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the term "home invasion" came in use, the term "hot burglary" was often used in the literature. Early references also use "burglary of occupied homes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lawrence, Jr. |last=Southwick |title=Guns and Justifiable Homicide: Deterrence and Defense |volume=18 |journal=St. Louis U Pub Law Rev |pages=217 [p. 227] |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "burglar striking an occupied residence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Wright |first2=Peter |last2=Rossi |first3=Kathleen |last3=Daly |title=Under the Gun |location=New York |publisher=Aldine |year=1983 |page=15 |isbn=0-202-30305-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Connecticut]] Congressman [[Chris Murphy (Connecticut politician)|Chris Murphy]] proposed in 2008 making home invasion a [[federal crime]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Chris Murphy |url=http://projects.wsj.com/campaign2012/candidates/view/chris-murphy--CT-S |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chrismurphy.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=44&amp;Itemid=55 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326104354/http://www.chrismurphy.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=44&amp;Itemid=55 |archivedate=March 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
The ''[[Chauffeurs de la Drome]]'' (The Heaters of Drôme) were a gang of four men who carried out a series of attacks on remote dwellings in the [[Drôme|Department of  Drôme]] in south-west France between 1905 and 1908. They became notorious for roasting the feet of householders against the fireplace, to torture them into revealing the hiding places of valuables.&lt;ref name="romanshistorique"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.romanshistorique.fr/romans-sur-isere-la-maison-des-chauffeurs-de-la-drome-rue-pecherie | title=La maison des Chauffeurs de la Drôme, rue Pêcherie | publisher=Romans Historique | language=French | date=26 May 2010 | accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson2011" /&gt; Responsible for as many as 18 murders,&lt;ref name="Anderson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm Anderson|title=In Thrall to Political Change: Police and Gendarmerie in France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CYqKByxmueEC&amp;pg=PA53|date=25 August 2011|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-969364-1|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; three of the gang were guillotined on September 22, 1909. The fourth died on the penal colony at [[Devil's Island]].&lt;ref name="Histoires de bourreaux"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://histoiresdebourreaux.blogspot.co.uk/2009/09/22-septembre-1909-lexecution-des.html | title=Histoires de bourreaux | language=French | date=22 September 2009 | accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One well-known home invasion is the November 15, 1959, quadruple murder of the Clutter family by [[Richard Hickock|Richard "Dick" Hickock]] and [[Perry Smith (murderer)|Perry Edward Smith]] during a home-invasion robbery in rural [[Holcomb, Kansas|Holcomb]], Kansas. The murders were detailed in [[Truman Capote]]'s "nonfiction novel" ''[[In Cold Blood]]''. However, the perpetrators were convicted of murder, not home invasion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/family/clutter/4.html Crime library article on Clutter family murders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403063659/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/family/clutter/4.html |date=April 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, two paroled criminals were each charged with three counts of capital murder during a [[Cheshire, Connecticut, home invasion murders|home invasion into the Petit family home]] in [[Cheshire, Connecticut]], on July 23, 2007. During the invasion, the mother died of asphyxiation due to strangulation and the two daughters died of smoke inhalation after the suspects set the house on fire. The men were charged with first-degree sexual assault, murder of a kidnapped person, and murder of two or more people at the same time. The state attorney sought the death penalty against the suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfsb.com/cheshirecase/13762474/detail.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808182554/http://www.wfsb.com/cheshirecase/13762474/detail.html |archivedate=August 8, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first defendant, Steven Hayes, was found guilty of 16 of 17 counts including capital murder on October 5, 2010, and on November 8, 2010, was sentenced to death. His co-defendant, Joshua Komisarjevsky, was convicted of all 17 counts against him in October 2011, and was also sentenced to death. Both men later had their sentences commuted to life without parole when Connecticut abolished the death penalty in 2015.

Another home invasion occurred on November 26, 2007, when [[Washington Redskins]] star [[Sean Taylor]] was murdered during an overnight home invasion of his suburban [[Miami]] home. Four defendants were charged with this crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SEAN TAYLOR MURDER: Men arrested held without bond |url=http://www.winknews.com/news/local/11995026.html |publisher=WINK News |date=December 1, 2007 |accessdate=April 4, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201190807/http://www.winknews.com/news/local/11995026.html |archivedate=February 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many U.S. states (particularly those that endorse the [[Castle Doctrine]]) include defending oneself against forcible entry of one's home as part of their definition of justifiable [[homicide]] without any [[Duty to retreat|obligation to retreat]].&lt;ref&gt;K.

The '''Human Brain Project''' ('''HBP''') is a large ten-year scientific research project, based on [[Exascale computing|exascale supercomputers]], that aims to build a collaborative [[Information and communications technology|ICT]]-based scientific research infrastructure to allow researchers across Europe to advance knowledge in the fields of neuroscience, computing, and brain-related medicine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Human Brain Project, Framework Partnership Agreement https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/documents/10180/538356/FPA++Annex+1+Part+B/41c4da2e-0e69-4295-8e98-3484677d661f&lt;/ref&gt; The Project, which started on 1 October 2013, is a [[European Commission]]  [[Future and Emerging Technologies]] Flagship. The HBP is coordinated by the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]] and is largely funded by the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/fet-flagships&lt;/ref&gt; The project coordination office is in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Human Brain Project relocates to Geneva|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/science_technology/Human_Brain_Project_relocates_to_Geneva.html?cid=37219978|accessdate=29 October 2013|newspaper=SwissInfo|date=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic goals and organisation==
[[File:Rolex Learning center.jpg|thumb|The 2013 HBP Summit–the inauguration of the Project–took place in the [[EPFL Learning Centre]] in October 2013. It brought together scientists from over 100 Partner Institutions.]]

Fundamental to the HBP approach is to investigate the brain on different spatial and temporal scales (i.e. from the molecular to the large networks underlying higher cognitive processes, and from milliseconds to years). To achieve this goal, the HBP relies on the collaboration of scientists from diverse disciplines, including neuroscience, philosophy and computer science, to take advantage of the loop of experimental data, modelling theories and simulations. The idea is that empirical results are used to develop theories, which then foster modelling and simulations which result in predictions that are in turn verified by empirical results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2016.10.046 |pmid=27809997 |title=The Human Brain Project: Creating a European Research Infrastructure to Decode the Human Brain |journal=Neuron |volume=92 |issue=3 |pages=574–581 |year=2016 |last1=Amunts |first1=Katrin |last2=Ebell |first2=Christoph |last3=Muller |first3=Jeff |last4=Telefont |first4=Martin |last5=Knoll |first5=Alois |last6=Lippert |first6=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary objective of the HBP is to create an ICT-based research infrastructure for brain research, cognitive neuroscience and brain-inspired computing, which can be used by researchers world-wide.

The Project is divided into 12 Subprojects. Six of these develop ICT-based platforms (Subprojects 5-10), which consist of prototype hardware, software, databases, and programming interfaces. These tools are available to researchers worldwide via the HBP [[Collaboratory]]. Three Subprojects gather data on empirical neuroscience and establish theoretical foundations (Subprojects 1-4) and one is responsible for ethics and society (Subproject 12). Subproject 11 coordinates the project.

* SP2 Human Brain Organisation: Understanding the structure of the human brain, and its electrical and chemical functions
* SP3 Systems and Cognitive Neuroscience: Understanding how the brain performs its systems-level and cognitive functional activities
* SP4 Theoretical Neuroscience: Deriving high-level mathematical models to synthesize conclusions from research data
* SP5 [[Neuroinformatics]] Platform: Gathering, organising and making available brain data

* SP7 [[High-performance computing|High-performance Analytics and Computing]] Platform: Providing the ICT capability to map the brain in unprecedented detail, construct complex models, run large simulations, and analyse large volumes of data
* SP8 [[Medical informatics|Medical Informatics]] Platform: Developing the infrastructure to share hospital and medical research data for the purpose of understanding disease clusters and their respective disease signatures
* SP9 [[Neuromorphic engineering|Neuromorphic Computing]] Platform: Developing and applying brain-inspired computing technology
* SP10 [[Neurorobotics]] Platform: Developing virtual and real robots and environments for testing brain simulations
* SP11 Management and Coordination: General coordination of the project
* SP12 Ethics and Society: Exploring the ethical and societal impact of HBP’s work

The HBP is coordinated by the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne and involves researchers from over 117 partner institutions in 19 countries across Europe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Notable Partner Institutions include the [[University of Heidelberg]], [[Forschungszentrum Jülich]], and the [[University Hospital of Lausanne]].

The scientific direction is provided by representatives from each of the HBP's Subprojects, which form the Science and Infrastructure Board (SIB). Katrin Amunts from Forschungszentrum Jülich is the Chair of the SIB. Alois Knoll from TU Munich is Vice Chair of the SIB for software. The Directorate steers the daily work of the HBP – it is led by Andreas Mortensen from EPFL. 

==Funding==
The HBP is funded by the European Commission Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT) under the Horizon 2020 framework, an EU Research and Innovation funding programme. It was one of the two initial Future Emerging Technologies (FET) Flagship projects.

The project is split into five phases, each supplied with separate funding. The call for funding for the Project's initial two-and-a-half-year 'Ramp-Up Phase' of  EUR 54 million closed in November 2013 and the results were announced in March 2014. Twenty-two projects from thirty-two organisations were selected for the initial funding of EUR 8.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Human Brain Project just got bigger |url=https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/documents/10180/538356/HBP+Competitive+Calls+Programme+-+Press+Release/e98a279e-6e08-4ad5-bd07-b125c9d63cd3?version=1.1 |accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ramp-Up Phase ended on 31 March 2016. Funding is reassessed every two years using Specific Grant Agreements (SGA); the first of which began in April 2016 (ending in April 2018), and the second with a total EU funding of 88 Million Euro starting in April 2018 (ending in March 2020). The HBP's total costs are estimated at EUR 1.019 billion, of which EUR 500 million will be provided by the European Commission, EUR 500 million by national, public and private organisations, and EUR 19 million by the Core Project Ramp-Up Phase Partners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Obstacles==
One of the Project's primary hurdles is the unsystematic nature of the information collected from previous brain research. Neurological research data varies by biological organisation schemes, species studied, and by developmental stages, making it difficult to collectively use the data to replicate the brain in a model that acts as a single system.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;[http://tierra.aslab.upm.es/documents/projects/HBP_flagship_report_for_Europe.pdf "A Report to the European Commission" ] The Human Brain Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other obstacles include engineering problems involving power consumption, memory, and storage.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/discover/the-project/overview&lt;/ref&gt; For example, detailed neuron representations are very computationally expensive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/s12868-015-0162-6 |title=Simulation of alcohol action upon a detailed Purkinje neuron model and a simpler surrogate model that runs &gt;400 times faster |journal=BMC Neuroscience |volume=16 |year=2015 |last1=Forrest |first1=Michael D }}&lt;/ref&gt; and whole brain simulation is at the leading edge of our computational capability.

==Implications==
[[File:01337LOW HQ MERCK SERONO.jpg|thumb|The Human Brain Project moved to [[Campus Biotech]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/sci-tech/surprise-move_human-brain-project-relocates-to-geneva/37219978|title=Human Brain Project relocates to Geneva - SWI swissinfo.ch|website=SWI swissinfo.ch|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Technologies generated by the HBP and other similar projects offer several possibilities to other fields of research. For instance, a brain model can be used to investigate signatures of disease in the brain and the impact of certain drugs, enabling the development of better diagnosis and treatment methods. Ultimately, these technologies will likely lead to more advanced medical options available to patients at a lower cost.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

In addition, detailed brain simulation requires significant computing power, leading to developments in supercomputing and energy-efficient, brain-inspired computing techniques. Computational developments can be extended into areas such as data mining, telecommunications, appliances, and other industrial uses.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

The long-term ethical consequences of the Project are also considered. The Project follows a policy of Responsible Research and Innovation, and its Ethics Advisory Board is responsible for monitoring the use of human volunteers, animal subjects, and the data collected. Implications on European society, industry, and economy are investigated by the HBP Ethics and Society Programme's Foresight Lab.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/ethics-and-society Human Brain Project-Ethics and Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829141728/http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/ethics-and-society |date=29 August 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
An open letter was sent on 7 July 2014 to the European Commission by 154 European researchers (750 signatures as of 3 September 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/513027a |pmid=25186884 |title=Neuroscience: Where is the brain in the Human Brain Project? |journal=Nature |volume=513 |issue=7516 |pages=27–9 |year=2014 |last1=Frégnac |first1=Yves |last2=Laurent |first2=Gilles |bibcode=2014Natur.513...27F }}&lt;/ref&gt; complaining of the HBP's overly narrow approach, and threatening to boycott the Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open message to the European Commission concerning the Human Brain Project|url=http://www.neurofuture.eu/|accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to this controversy was an internal dispute about funding for cognitive scientists who study high level brain functions, such as thought and behaviour. However, the HBP stated that there is “no question that cognition and behaviour are vital to the HBP”, explaining that cognitive neuroscience research was repositioned in the Project to allow the Core Project to focus on building the Platforms. In addition, The Open Letter called on the EC to “reallocate the funding currently allocated to the HBP core and partnering projects to broad neuroscience-directed funding to meet the original goals of the HBP—understanding brain function and its effect on society”. In its response, the HBP said that “while [neuroscience research] generates a vast amount of valuable data, there is currently no technology for sharing, organising, analysing or integrating this information, beyond papers and even databases. The HBP will provide the critical missing layer to move towards a multi-level reconstruction and simulation of the brain”. It added that “cognitive and behavioural neuroscience will become the most significant component of neuroscience in HBP over the course of the Project. However, for this to happen the Platforms have to be in place first”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/documents/10180/17646/HBP-Statement.090614.pdf|title=The Vital Role of Neuroscience in the Human Brain Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=11 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823003843/https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/documents/10180/17646/HBP-Statement.090614.pdf|archivedate=23 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Dayan]], director of computational neuroscience at [[University College London]], argued that the goal of a large-scale simulation of the brain is radically premature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientists threaten to boycott €1.2bn Human Brain Project|publisher=The Guardian|date=7 July 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/07/human-brain-project-researchers-threaten-boycott|accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Geoffrey Hinton]] said that "[t]he real problem with that project is they have no clue how to get a large system like that to learn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brean |first=Joseph |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com/2014/07/08/a-billion-dollar-european-effort-to-model-the-human-brain-in-a-supercomputer-is-in-danger-of-collapsing |title=A billion-dollar European effort to model the brain in a supercomputer is in danger of collapsing |work=[[National Post]] |date=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns as to the project's methodology were raised by [[Robert Epstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer|title=Your brain does not process information and it is not a computer – Robert Epstein {{!}} Aeon Essays|website=Aeon|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HBP has said that its members share the uncertainty surrounding large-scale simulation, but that “reconstructing and simulating the human brain is a vision, a target; the benefits will come from the technology needed to get there. That technology, developed by the HBP, will benefit all of neuroscience as well as related fields”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2015 the project underwent a review process and the three-member executive committee, led by Markram, was dissolved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1015-36 |title=Trouble in Mind |journal=Scientific American |volume=313 |issue=4 |pages=36–42 |year=2015 |last1=Theil |first1=Stefan |bibcode=2015SciAm.313d..36T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced by a 22-member governing board.&lt;ref&gt;http://sciencebusiness.net/news/77294/%E2%82%AC1B-Human-Brain-Project-back-on-track-after-Commission-signs-new-contract{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''internally displaced person''' ('''IDP''') is someone who is [[forced displacement|forced to flee]] his or her home but who remains within his or her country's borders. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Internally Displaced Persons|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/internally-displaced-people.html|website=UNHCR|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often referred to as [[refugees]], although they do not fall within the [[Refugee#Legal definition|legal definitions]] of a refugee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=IJR Center|title=Who is a Refugee|url=http://www.ijrcenter.org/refugee-law/#Who_Is_a_Refugee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2014, it was estimated there were 38.2 million IDPs worldwide, the highest level since 1989, the first year for which global statistics on IDPs are available.  The countries with the largest IDP populations were [[Syria]] (7.6 million), [[Colombia]] (6 million), [[Iraq]] (3.6 million), the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (2.8 million), [[Sudan]] (2.2 million), [[South Sudan]] (1.6 million), [[Pakistan]] (1.4 million), [[Nigeria]] (1.2 million) and [[Somalia]] (1.1 million).&lt;ref name="UNHCRtrends"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unhcr.org/556725e69.html |title=UNHCR – Global Trends –Forced Displacement in 2014 |publisher=UNHCR |date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] and [[UNHCR]] support monitoring and analysis of worldwide IDPs through the Geneva-based [[Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/publisher/IDMC.html IDMC at the UNHCR website]: "At the request of the United Nations, the Geneva-based IDMC runs an online database providing comprehensive information and analysis on internal displacement in some 50 countries."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Whereas '[[refugee]]' has an authoritative definition under the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]], there is no universal legal definition of internally displaced persons (IDP); only a regional treaty for African countries (see [[Kampala Convention]]). However, a United Nations report, ''Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement'' uses the definition of: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border."&lt;ref name="Deng 1998"&gt;{{Cite book| first=Francis | last=Deng| contribution=The guiding principles on internal displacement| title=E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.l, February 11. New York, NY: United Nations| editor-first=| editor-last=| coeditors=| publisher=United Nations| place=New York| pages=| date=| year=| id= | contribution-url=http://www.reliefweb.int/ocha_ol/pub/idp_gp/idp.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the above stresses two important elements of internal displacement (coercion and the domestic/internal movement), it is important to note that, rather than a strict definition, the Guiding Principles offer "a descriptive identification of the category of persons whose needs are the concern of the Guiding Principles".&lt;ref&gt;KALIN, G. "Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. Annotations." The American Society of International Law &amp; The Brookings Institution Project on Internal Displacement. Studies in Transnational Legal Policy, No. 32, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the document "intentionally steers
toward flexibility rather than legal precision"&lt;ref&gt;VINCENT, M, "IDPs: rights and status", Forced Migration Review, August 2000, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; as the words "in particular" indicate that the list of reasons for displacement is not exhaustive. However, as Erin Mooney has pointed out, "global statistics on internal displacement generally count only IDPs uprooted by conflict and human rights violations. Moreover, a recent study has recommended that the IDP concept should be defined even more narrowly, to be limited to persons displaced by violence."&lt;ref&gt;MOONEY, E. "The Concept of Internal Displacement and the Case for Internally Displaced Persons as a Category of Concern." Refugee Survey Quarterly. (24) 3, 2005, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, despite the non-exhaustive reasons of internal displacement, many consider IDPs as those who would be defined as refugees if they were to cross an international border, hence, the term refugees in all but name is often applied to IDPs.

==IDP populations==
It is very difficult to get accurate figures for internally displaced persons because populations aren't constant. IDPs may be returning home while others are fleeing, others may periodically return to IDP camps to take advantage of humanitarian aid. While the case of IDPs in large camps such as those in Darfur, western Sudan, are relatively well-reported, it is very difficult to assess those IDPs who flee to larger towns and cities. It is necessary in many instances to supplement official figures with additional information obtained from operational humanitarian organizations on the ground.  Thus, the 24.5 million figure must be treated as an estimate.&lt;ref name='IDMC 2006'&gt;{{cite book | last = IDMC | first = | authorlink = | title = INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT Global Overview of Trends and Developments in 2006 | publisher = Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, Norwegian Refugee Council |date=April 2006 | location = Geneva | pages = | url = http://www.internal-displacement.org/assets/publications/2007/2007-global-overview2006-global-en.pdf  |format=PDF}}p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, most official figures only include those displaced by conflict or natural disasters.  [[Development-induced displacement|Development-induced]] IDPs often are not included in assessments. It has been estimated that between 70 and 80% of all IDPs are women and children.&lt;ref name="internal-displacement.org"&gt;{{cite book | last = IDMC | first = | authorlink = | title = INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT Global Overview of Trends and Developments in 2006 | publisher = Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, Norwegian Refugee Council |date=April 2006 | location = Geneva | pages = | url = http://www.internal-displacement.org/assets/publications/2007/2007-global-overview2006-global-en.pdf  |format=PDF}}p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

50% of internally displaced people and refugees were thought to be in urban areas in 2010, many of them in protracted displacement with little likelihood of ever returning home. A 2013 study found that these protracted urban displacements had not been given due weight by international aid and governance as historically they had focused on rural cam displacement responses.&lt;ref name="odi.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|first=Simone |last=Haysom|title= Sanctuary in the city? Reframing responses to protracted urban displacement, HPG Policy Briefs|url= http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/7533-sanctuary-city-responses-protracted-urban-displacement|website=odi.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study argues that this protracted urban displacement needs a fundamental change in the approach to those who are displaced and their host societies. They note that re-framing responses to urban displacement will also involve [[human rights and development]] actors and local and national governments. They call for a change in the narrative around the issue is needed to reflect ingenuity and fortitude displayed by displaced populations, the opportunities for self-sufficiency and safety represented by urban areas, and that the displaced can make a contribution to their host societies.&lt;ref name="odi.org.uk"/&gt;

===Notable IDP camps===
* There are many [[List of internally displaced persons camps in Nigeria|IDP camps in Nigeria]] and especially many [[Internally Displaced Person Camps in Borno|IDP camps in Borno State]].
* Until recently there were many [[Internally displaced persons in Sri Lanka#The camps|IDP camps in Sri Lanka]].

==Protection and assistance==
The problem of protecting and assisting IDPs is not a new issue.  In international law it is the responsibility of the government concerned to provide assistance and protection for the IDPs in their country.  However, as many of the displaced are a result of civil conflict and violence or where the authority of the central state is in doubt, there is no local authority willing to provide assistance and protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Goodwin-Gill, Guy S. |title=The refugee in international law |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1996 |pages= |isbn=0-19-826019-9 |oclc= |doi=}}p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that some 5 million IDPs in 11 countries are "without any significant humanitarian assistance from their governments."&lt;ref name="internal-displacement.org"/&gt; Under these circumstances rehabilitation policies on humanitarian grounds should be aimed at reducing inequality of opportunity among these vulnerable groups by integrating them into local social services and allowing them access to jobs, education, and healthcare opportunities; otherwise new conflicts might break out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Das|first1=Tuhin K.|last2=Haldar|first2=Sushil K.|last3=Das Gupta|first3=Ivy|last4=Kundu|first4=Sangeeta|title=Deprivation of Internally Displaced Persons: Case Studies in India|date=August 2016|publisher=Power Publishers|location=India|isbn=978-93-85892-71-4|pages=130|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the case of refugees, there is no international humanitarian institution which has the overall responsibility of protecting and assisting the refugees as well as the internally displaced. A number of  organizations have stepped into the breach in specific circumstances.

===UNHCR===
The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) was mandated by General Assembly Resolution 428 (V) of 14 December 1950 to "lead and coordinate international action for the worldwide protection
of refugees and the resolution of refugee problems....guided by the 1951 United Nations [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] and its 1967 Protocol."&lt;ref name='UNHCR Mission`'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/publ/PUBL/4565a5742.pdf |title=Mission Statement |accessdate=2007-10-24 |publisher=UNHCR |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UNHCR has traditionally argued that it does not have a "general competence for IDPs" even though at least since 1972 it had relief and rehabillatation programs for those displaced within a country.  However, in cases where there is a specific request by the UN Secretary General and with the consent of the State concerned it has been willing to respond by assisting IDPs in a given instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Goodwin-Gill, Guy S. |title=The refugee in international law |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1996 |pages= |isbn=0-19-826019-9 |oclc= |doi=}}p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 it was helping some 5.6 million IDPs (out of over 25 million), but only about 1.1 million in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Cohen in {{cite book |author=Marsella, Anthony J. |title=Fear of Persecution: Global Human Rights, International Law, and Human Well-Being |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lexington, Mass |year= 2007|pages= |url= https://www.google.com/books?id=YeSKaWWGGAAC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;vq=cohen&amp;sig=0nKLpuljq26B7RAl6qZqbYEvZ8Q#PPA15,M1|isbn=0-7391-1566-9 |oclc= |doi=}}p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Strengthening Protection of IDPs: The UN's Role|journal=Georgetown Journal of International Affairs|date=Winter–Spring 2006|first=Roberta|last=Cohen|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/articles/2006/winter_humanrights_cohen/Cohen_2006_GJIA.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-10-23 }} p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2005, the UNHCR signed an agreement with other humanitarian agencies. "Under this agreement, UNHCR will assume the lead responsibility for protection, emergency shelter and camp management for internally displaced people."&lt;ref name='UNHCR and IDPs'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/basics/BASICS/405ef8c64.pdf |title=Internally Displaced People Q&amp;A |accessdate=2007-10-24 |publisher=UNHCR |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ICRC===
The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] has a mandate of ensuring the application of [[International Humanitarian Law]] as it affects civilians in the midst of armed conflict.  They have traditionally not distinguished between civilians who are internally displaced and those who remain in their homes.  In a 2006 policy statement, the ICRC stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ICRC's overall objective is to alleviate the suffering of people who are caught up in armed conflict and other situations of violence. To that end, the organization strives to provide effective and efficient assistance and protection for such persons, be they displaced or not, while taking into consideration the action of other humanitarian organizations.
On the basis of its long experience in different parts of the world, the ICRC has defined an operational approach towards the civilian population as a whole that is designed to meet the most urgent humanitarian needs of both displaced persons and local and host communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/idp-icrc-position-030706/$File/2006_IDPs_EN_ICRCExternalPosition.pdf |format=PDF|title= ICRC Position on Internally Displaced Persons|accessdate=2007-10-23 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, its Director of Operations has earlier recognized that IDPs "deprived of shelter and their habitual sources of food, water, medicine and money, they have different, and often more urgent, material needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jean-Daniel |last=Tauxe |title=We Should Have Humanitarian Access to Displaced Civilians |date=2000-03-01 |publisher= |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2000/03/01/edtauxe.t.php |work=International Herald Tribune |pages= |accessdate=2007-10-24 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125150508/http://www.iht.com/articles/2000/03/01/edtauxe.t.php |archivedate=November 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaborative approach===
The previous system set up internationally to address the needs of IDPs was referred to as the collaborative approach as the responsibility  for protecting and assisting IDPs was shared among the UN agencies, i.e. UNHCR, [[Unicef]], [[WFP]], [[UNDP]], [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], the International Organization for Migration [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]], the ICRC and International [[NGOs]]. Coordination is the responsibility of the UN [[Emergency Relief Coordinator]] and the [[Humanitarian Coordinator]] in the country  concerned.&lt;ref name='IASC 2003'&gt;{{cite book| last =IASC| first =| authorlink =| title =Implementing the Collaborative Response to Situations of Internal Displacement| publisher =United Nations| date =September 2004| location =New York| pages =| url =http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004BE3B1/(httpInfoFiles)/9251510E3E5B6FC3C12572BF0029C267/$file/Global_Overview_2006.pdf| doi =| id =| isbn =| format =PDF| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071029221242/http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004BE3B1/(httpInfoFiles)/9251510E3E5B6FC3C12572BF0029C267/$file/Global_Overview_2006.pdf| archivedate =2007-10-29| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are assisted by the Inter-Agency Displacement Division, which was created in 2004 and is housed in the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ([[OCHA]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reliefweb.int/idp/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The original collaborative approach has come under increasing criticism. Roberta Cohen reports: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nearly every UN and independent evaluation has found the collaborative approach deficient when it comes to IDPs. To begin with, there is no real focus of responsibility in the field for assisting and protecting...There is also no predictability of action, as the different agencies are free to pick and choose the situations in which they wish to become involved on the basis of their respective mandates, resources, and interests. In every new emergency, no one knows for sure which agency or combination thereof will become involved.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Strengthening Protection of IDPs: The UN's Role|journal=Georgetown Journal of International Affairs|date=Winter–Spring 2006|first=Roberta|last=Cohen|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/articles/2006/winter_humanrights_cohen/Cohen_2006_GJIA.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-10-24 }}p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2005 there was an attempt to fix the problem by giving sectoral responsibilities to different humanitarian agencies, most notably with the UNHCR taking on the responsibility for protection and the management of camps and emergency shelters.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2006"/&gt; The ''Forced Migration Review" stated that the "abnegation of responsibility is possible because there is no formal responsibility apportioned to agencies under the Collaborative Response, and thus no accountability when agencies renege on their promises."&lt;ref&gt;DAVIES, A. and MURRAY, M.W., "Implementation of the Collaborative Response in Liberia", Forced Migration Review. IDP Supplement. October 2005, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cluster approach==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
The cluster approach designates individual agencies as ‘sector leaders’ to coordinate operations in specific areas to try to plug those newly identified gaps. The cluster approach was conceived amid concerns about coordination and capacity that arose from the weak operational response to the crisis in Darfur in 2004 and 2005, and the critical findings of the Humanitarian Response Review (HRR) commissioned by the then ERC, Jan Egeland. Egeland called for strengthening leadership of the sectors, and introduced the concept of "clusters" at different levels (headquarters, regional, country and operational)’.

The cluster approach operates on the global and local levels. At the global level, the approach is meant to build up capacity in eleven key ‘gap’ areas by developing better surge capacity, ensuring consistent access to appropriately trained technical expertise and enhanced material stockpiles, and securing the increased engagement of all relevant humanitarian partners. At the field level, the cluster approach strengthens the coordination and response capacity by mobilizing clusters of humanitarian agencies (UN/Red Cross-Red Crescent/IOs/NGOs) to respond in particular sectors or areas of activity, each cluster having a clearly designated and accountable lead, as agreed by the HC and the Country Team. Designated lead agencies at the global level both participate directly in operations, but also coordinate with and oversee other organizations within their specific spheres, reporting the results up through a designated chain of command to the ERC at the summit. However, lead agencies are responsible as ‘providers of last resort’, which represents the commitment of cluster leads to do their utmost to ensure an adequate and appropriate response in their respective areas of responsibility. The cluster approach was part of a package of reforms accepted by the IASC in December 2005 and subsequently applied in eight chronic humanitarian crises and six sudden-onset emergencies. However, the reform was originally rolled out and evaluated in four countries: DRC, Liberia, Somalia and Uganda.

The clusters were originally concentrated on nine areas: 
# Logistics (WFP)
# [[Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC)|Emergency Telecommunications Cluster]] (WFP)
# Camp coordination and management (UNHCR for conflict-generated IDPs and IOM for natural disaster-generated IDPs)
# [[Shelter Cluster|Shelter]] ([[IFRC]] for natural disasters; UNHCR for conflict situations)
# Health (WHO)
# Nutrition (UNICEF)
# Water, sanitation, and hygiene promotion (UNICEF)
# Early recovery (UNDP); and
# Protection (UNHCR for conflict-generated IDPs, UNHCR, UNICEF, and OHCHR for natural disaster generated IDPs).

IASC Principles deemed it unnecessary to apply the cluster approach to four sectors where no significant gaps were detected: a) food, led by WFP; b) refugees, led by UNHCR; c) education, led by UNICEF; and d) agriculture, led by FAO.

The original nine clusters were later expanded to include agriculture and education.

==International law==
Unlike the case of refugees, there is no international universal treaty which applies specifically to IDPs. Only a regional treaty for African countries has been established (see [[Kampala Convention]]). Some other countries have advocated re-thinking the definitions and protections for refugees to apply to IDPs, but so far no solid actions have come to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Celik|first1=Ayse Betul|title=Transnationalization of Human Rights Norms and Its Impact on Internally Displaced Kurds|journal=Human Rights Quarterly|date=August 2005|volume=27|issue=3|pages=969–997|jstor=20069817|doi=10.1353/hrq.2005.0032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2617336|title=The New Refugees and the Old Treaty: Persecutors and Persecuted in the Twenty-First Century|first=Andrew I.|last=Schoenholtz|date=11 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing the gap, the UN Secretary-General, Boutros-Ghali appointed [[Francis Deng]] in 1992 as his representative for internally displaced persons.  Besides acting as an advocate for IDPs, Deng set out in 1994, at the request of the UN General Assembly to examine and bring together existing international laws which relating to the protection of IDPs.&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Cohen in {{cite book |author=Marsella, Anthony J. |title=Fear of Persecution: Global Human Rights, International Law, and Human Well-Being |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lexington, Mass |year= 2007|pages= |url= https://www.google.com/books?id=YeSKaWWGGAAC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;vq=cohen&amp;sig=0nKLpuljq26B7RAl6qZqbYEvZ8Q#PPA15,M1|isbn=0-7391-1566-9 |oclc= |doi=}}p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  The result of this work was the document, ''Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement''.&lt;ref name="Deng 1998"/&gt;

The Guiding Principles lay out the responsibilities of states before displacement – that is, to prevent displacement – during and after displacement. They have been endorsed by the UN General Assembly, the African Commission on Human and People's Rights (ACHPR) and by the signatories to the 2006 [[Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region]], which include Sudan, DRC and Uganda.

The Guiding Principles, however, are non-binding. As Bahame Tom Nyanduga, Special Rapporteur on Refugees, IDPs and Asylum Seekers in Africa for the ACHPR has stated, "the absence of a binding international legal regime on internal displacement is a grave lacuna in international law."&lt;ref name='African IDPs'&gt;{{cite journal|title=The challenge of internal displacement in Africa|journal=Forced Migration Review|date=September 2004|first=Bahame Tom|last=Nyanduga|volume=21|issue=|pages=|id= |url=http://www.fmreview.org/FMRpdfs/FMR21/FMR21full.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2004 the Secretary-General of the UN showed the continuing concern of his office by  appointing Walter Kälin as his Representative on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons.  Part of his mandate includes the promoting of the Guiding Principles.&lt;ref name='IDP Representative'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/idp/mandate.htm |title=Mandate |accessdate=2007-10-24 |publisher=UNHCHR |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070807075712/http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/idp/mandate.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Right of return ==
In so-called "post-conflict" situations, there has traditionally been an emphasis in the international community to seek to return to the pre-war status-quo.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Sara Pantuliano (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4409&amp;title=uncharted-territory-land-conflict-humanitarian-action Uncharted Territory: Land, Conflict and Humanitarian Action] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, opinions are gradually changing, because violent conflict destroys political, economic and social structures and new structures develop as a result, quite often irreversibly.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Furthermore, returning to the pre-war status-quo may actually be undesirable if pre-war structures led to the conflict in the first place, or prevented its early resolution. IDPs' and [[refugees]]' right of return can represent one of the most complex aspects of this issue.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

Normally, pressure is applied by the [[international community]] and [[humanitarian organization]] to ensure displaced people are able to return to their areas of origin and the same property.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; The UN Principles for Housing and Property Restitution for Refugees and IDPs, otherwise known as the Pinheiro Principles, provides guidance on the management of the technical and legal aspects of housing, land and property (HLP) restitution.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; [[Restitution]] rights are of key importance to IDPs and refugees around the world, and important to try preventing aggressors benefiting from conflict.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; However, without a clear understanding of each local context, full restitution rights can be unworkable and fail to protect the people it is designed to protect for the following reasons, refugees and IDPs:&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
* may never have had property (e.g. in Afghanistan);
* cannot access what property they have (Colombia, Guatemala, South Africa and Sudan);
* ownership is unclear as families have expanded or split and division of the land becomes an issue;
* death of owner may leave dependents without clear claim to the land;
* people settled on the land know it is not theirs but have nowhere else to go (as in Colombia, Rwanda and Timor-Leste); and
* have competing claims with others, including the state and its foreign or local business partners (as in Aceh, Angola, Colombia, Liberia and Sudan)

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] stress the need for [[humanitarian organization]] to develop a greater expertise in these issues, using experts who have a knowledge in both humanitarian and land and property issues and so provide better advice to state actors seeking to resolve these issues.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; The ODI calls on humanitarian agencies to develop an awareness of sustainable reintegration as part of their emphasis on returning IDPs and refugees home.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Legal advice needs to be provided to all parties involved even if a framework is created in which to resolve these issues.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

'''Isogamy''' is a form of [[sexual reproduction]] that involves [[gamete]]s of similar [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] (similar shape and size), differing in general only in [[allele]] [[Gene expression|expression]] in one or more [[mating-type region]]s. Because both gametes look alike, they cannot be classified as "[[male]]" or "[[female]]". Instead, organisms undergoing isogamy are said to have different [[mating type]]s, most commonly noted as "+" and "&amp;minus;" strains, although in some species of [[Basidiomycota]] there are more than two mating types (designated by numbers or letters). In all cases, [[fertilization]] occurs when gametes of two different mating types fuse to form a [[zygote]].

==Evolution==
It appears that isogamy was the first stage of [[sexual reproduction]]. In several lineages (plants, animals), this form of reproduction independently evolved to [[anisogamy|anisogamous]] species with [[gamete]]s of male and [[female]] types to [[oogamy|oogamous]] species in which the female gamete is very much larger than the male and has no ability to move. There is a good argument that this pattern was driven by the physical constraints on the mechanisms by which two gametes get together as required for [[sexual reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Dusenbery, David B. (2009). ''Living at Micro Scale'', Chapter 20. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts {{ISBN|978-0-674-03116-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ascomycetes]], anisogamy (sexes) evolved from isogamy before mating types.&lt;ref&gt;Beukeboom, L. and Perrin, N. (2014). ''The Evolution of Sex Determination''. Oxford University Press, p. 10 [https://books.google.com/books?id=d4cLBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Online resources, [http://www.oup.co.uk/companion/beukeboom].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2017|reason=Page number appears wrong. Someone should find the right page}}

==Biological types==

===With motile cells===
There are several types of isogamy. Both gametes may be [[Flagellum|flagellated]] and thus [[Motility|motile]]. This type occurs for example in [[algae]] such as some but not all species of ''[[Chlamydomonas]]''.

===With non-motile cells===
In another type, neither of the gametes is flagellated. This is the case for example in the [[mating of yeast]]. Yeast mating types are commonly noted as "a" and "α" (alpha) instead of "+" and "-".

===Conjugation===
Another, more complex form, is conjugation (similar to the exchange of genetic material through a bridge in [[bacterial conjugation]], but involving reproduction). This occurs in some the green algae, the [[Zygnematophyceae]], e.g., ''[[Spirogyra]]''. These algae grow as filaments of cells. When two filaments of opposing mating types come close together, the cells form conjugation tubes between the filaments. Once the tubes are formed, one cell balls up and crawls through the tube into the other cell to fuse with it, forming a zygote.

In [[ciliates]], cell fission may follow self-fertilization ([[autogamy]]), or it may follow conjugation (exchange of nuclei).

In [[zygomycete]]s fungi, two [[hyphae]] of opposing mating types form special structures called [[gametangia]] where the hyphae touch. The gametangia then fuse into a [[zygospore|zygosporangium]]. In other fungi, cells from two hyphae with opposing mating types fuse, but only the cytoplasm is fused ([[plasmogamy]]). The two nuclei do not fuse, leading to the formation of a [[dikaryon]] cell that gives rise to a [[mycelium]] consisting of dikaryons. [[Karyogamy]] (fusion of nuclei) then eventually occurs in [[sporangia]], and leads to the formation of diploid cells (zygotes) that immediately undergo [[meiosis]] to form [[spore]]s.
[[File:SpirogyraConjugation100x.jpg|thumb|Spirogyra conjugation]]
In many cases, isogamous fertilization is used by organisms that can also reproduce asexually through [[binary fission]], [[budding]], or asexual [[spore formation]]. The switch to [[sexual reproduction]] mode is often triggered by a change from favorable to unfavorable growing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernstein |first=H |last2=Bernstein |first2=C |last3=Michod |first3=RE |year=2011 |chapter=Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair |title=DNA Repair |editor=Inna Kruman |isbn=978-953-307-697-3 |publisher=InTech |url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/dna-repair/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fertilization often leads to the formation of a thick-walled zygotic [[resting spore]] that can withstand harsh environments and will germinate once growing conditions turn favorable again.

'''Józef Klemens Piłsudski'''{{Ref label|a|a|none}}, &lt;small&gt;[[Order of the Tower and Sword|GCTE]]&lt;/small&gt; ({{IPA-pl|ˈjuzɛf ˈklɛmɛns pʲiwˈsutskʲi|lang|Pl-Józef_Piłsudski.ogg}}; 5 December 1867&amp;nbsp;– 12 May 1935) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Politician|statesman]] who served as the [[Naczelnik państwa|Chief of State]] (1918–22) and [[Marshal of Poland|First Marshal]] of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (from 1920). He was considered the ''[[de facto]]'' leader (1926–35) of the Second Polish Republic as the [[Ministry of National Defence (Poland)|Minister of Military Affairs]]. From World War I he had great power in [[Politics of Poland|Polish politics]] and was a distinguished figure on the international scene.{{sfn|Plach|2006|p=14}} He is viewed as a father of the Second Polish Republic re-established in 1918, 123 years after the 1795 [[Partitions of Poland]] by [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]], [[Prussia]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]].{{r|DroSzwa95_911|Lieven94_159}}{{sfn|Lerski|1996|loc=[https://books.google.com/?id=QTUTqE2difgC&amp;pg=PA441 p. 441]}}{{sfn|Held|1992|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5O5NkwX-NnYC&amp;pg=PA249 p. 249]}}

Deeming himself a descendant of the culture and traditions of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]],{{r|Davies05_10}} Piłsudski believed in a multi-ethnic Poland—"a home of nations" including indigenous ethnic and religious minorities that he hoped would establish a robust union with the independent states of [[Lithuania]] and [[Ukraine]].{{r|Davies05_10}} His principal political antagonist, [[Roman Dmowski]], leader of the [[National Democrats (Poland)|National Democrat party]], by contrast, called for a Poland limited to the pre-Partitions [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Polish Crown]] and based mainly on a homogeneous ethnically Polish population and [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] identity.

Early in his political career, Piłsudski became a leader of the [[Polish Socialist Party]].  Concluding that Poland's independence would have to be won  militarily, he formed the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]]. In 1914 he correctly predicted the outbreak of a major war, the [[Russian Empire]]'s defeat by the [[Central Powers]], and the Central Powers' defeat by the [[Allies of World War I|western Allies]].{{r|Roos+Rothschild}} When [[World War I]] began in 1914, Piłsudski's Legions fought alongside [[Austria-Hungary]] against Russia. In 1917, with [[Imperial Russia|Imperalist Russia]] faring poorly in the war, he withdrew his support for the Central Powers and was imprisoned in [[Magdeburg]] by the Germans.

From November 1918, when Poland regained its independence, until 1922, Piłsudski was Poland's [[Naczelnik Państwa|Chief of State]]. In 1919–21 he commanded Polish forces in six border wars that re-defined the country's borders.  His forces seemed on the verge of defeat in the [[Polish–Soviet War]] when, in the August 1920 [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]], they threw back the invading Soviet Russian forces.  In 1923, with the government dominated by his opponents, in particular the [[National Democracy|National Democrats]], Piłsudski retired from active politics. Three years later he returned to power in the [[May Coup (Poland)|May 1926 ''coup d'état'']] and became Poland's [[Strongman (politics)|strongman]]. From then on until his death in 1935, he concerned himself primarily with military and foreign affairs.

In international affairs, Piłsudski pursued two complementary strategies meant to secure Poland's independence and to enhance her national security: "[[Prometheism]]", aimed at achieving the disintegration of [[Imperial Russia|Imperialist Russia]] and later the [[Soviet Union]] into their constituent nations; and the creation of an [[Intermarium]] federation of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an states lying between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Black Sea]]s; serving as a bridge between Germany and Russia. The proposed Intermarium's central purpose was to secure its peoples against [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Eastern Europe]]an [[imperialism]]s.{{sfn|Davies|2005|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=9Tbed6iMNLEC&amp;pg=PA55 55]}}

Historian [[Piotr S. Wandycz|Piotr Wandycz]] characterizes Piłsudski as "an ardent Polish patriot who on occasion would castigate the Poles for their stupidity, cowardice, or servility. He described himself as a [[Polish-Lithuanian identity|Polish-Lithuanian]], and was stubborn and reserved, loath to show his emotions."{{sfn|Wandycz|1990|p=452}} Though some aspects of Piłsudski's administration remain controversial, he is highly esteemed in Polish memory and is regarded, together with his chief antagonist [[Roman Dmowski]], as a founder of the modern independent Poland.

==Early life==
[[File:Piludski w szkole.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Piłsudski as a schoolboy]]
He was born 5 December 1867 to the [[szlachta|noble]] [[Piłsudski family|family Piłsudski]], at their manor named ''Zułów'', near the village of Zułowo  (now [[Zalavas]], [[Švenčionys district municipality]],{{sfn|Jędrzejewicz|1990|p=3}} [[Lithuania]]),{{sfn|Hetherington|2012|p=92}} in the Russian Empire since 1795 on the territory of the former [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The estate was part of the dowry brought by his mother, Maria, a member of the wealthy Billewicz family.{{sfn|Hetherington|2012|p=95}} The Piłsudski family, although pauperized,{{r|POleksa04}} cherished Polish patriotic traditions{{r|PolandGov|Urbank97_13-5}} and has been characterized either as Polish{{r|Lerski96_439|Davies05_40}} or as [[Polonized]]-[[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]].{{r|POleksa04|BidJef98_186}}{{Ref label|b|b|none}} Józef was the second son born to the family.
Józef, when he attended the Russian ''[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' in ''Wilno'' (now [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]), was not an especially diligent student.{{sfn|Roshwald|2001|p=36}} One of the younger Polish students at this gymnasium was the future Russian communist leader [[Felix Dzerzhinsky|Feliks Dzierżyński]], who later would become Piłsudski's arch-enemy.{{sfn|Blobaum|1984|p=30}} Along with his brothers [[Bronisław Piłsudski|Bronisław]], [[Adam Piłsudski|Adam]] and [[Jan Piłsudski|Jan]], Józef was introduced by his mother Maria, ''née'' Billewicz, to Polish history and literature, which were suppressed by the Russian authorities.{{r|McM03_208}} His father, likewise named Józef, had fought in the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] against Russian rule of Poland.{{r|PolandGov}}

[[File:Jozef Pilsudski in 1899.jpg|thumb|125px|upright|Piłsudski in 1899]]
The family resented the Russian government's [[Russification]] policies. Young Józef profoundly disliked having to attend [[Russian Orthodox Church]] service{{r|McM03_208}} and left school with an aversion not only for the [[Russian Tsar]] and the Russian Empire, but for the culture, which he knew well.{{r|POleksa04}}

In 1885 Piłsudski started [[medical school|medical studies]] at [[Kharkov University]] (now [[Kharkiv]], [[Ukraine]]), where he became involved with ''[[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]]'', part of the Russian ''[[Narodnik]]i'' revolutionary movement.{{r|PWN}} In 1886, he was suspended for participating in student demonstrations.{{r|PolandGov}} He was rejected by the [[University of Dorpat]] (now [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]]), whose authorities had been informed of his political affiliation.{{r|PolandGov}} On 22 March 1887, he was arrested by Tsarist authorities on a charge of plotting with [[Vilnius]] socialists to assassinate [[Tsar]] [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]. In fact, Piłsudski's main connection to the plot was the involvement of his elder brother [[Bronisław Piłsudski|Bronisław]], who was sentenced to fifteen years of [[hard labor]] (''[[katorga]]'') in eastern Siberia.{{r|ICRAP|Urbank97_50}}

Józef received a milder sentence: five years' exile in [[Siberia]], first at [[Kirensk]] on the [[Lena River]], then at [[Tunka]].{{r|PolandGov|Urbank97_50}} While being transported in a prisoners' convoy to Siberia, Piłsudski was held for several weeks at a prison in [[Irkutsk]].{{r|LandauDunlop30_30}} There, he took part in what the authorities viewed as a revolt. After one of the inmates had insulted a guard and refused to apologize, he and other political prisoners were beaten by the guards for their defiance;{{r|Urbank97_62-6}} Piłsudski lost two teeth and took part in a subsequent hunger strike until the authorities reinstated political prisoners' privileges that had been suspended after the incident.{{r|Urbank97_62-6}} For his involvement, he was sentenced in 1888 to six months' imprisonment.{{r|Urbank97_68-9}} He had to spend the first night of his incarceration in 40-degree-below-zero Siberian cold; this led to an illness that nearly killed him and to health problems that would plague him throughout life.{{r|Urbank97_68-9}}

During his years of exile in Siberia, Piłsudski met many ''[[Sybiraks]]'', including [[Bronisław Szwarce]], who had almost become a leader of the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]].{{r|Urbank97_74–7}} He was allowed to work in an occupation of his own choosing, and earned his living tutoring local children in mathematics and foreign languages{{r|POleksa04}} (he knew French, German and Lithuanian in addition to Russian and his native Polish; he would later learn English).{{sfn|Jędrzejewicz|Cisek|1994|p=13}} Local officials decided that as a Polish noble he was not entitled to the 10-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] pension received by most other exiles.{{r|Urbank97_71}}

In 1892 Piłsudski returned from exile and settled in Adomavas Manor near Teneniai (now in [[Šilalė district]]). In 1893 he joined the [[Polish Socialist Party]] (''PPS''){{r|PolandGov}} and helped organize its Lithuanian branch.{{r|Urbank97_88}} Initially he sided with the Socialists' more radical wing, but despite the socialist movement's ostensible [[proletarian internationalism|internationalism]] he remained a Polish nationalist.{{r|McM03_209}} In 1894, as its [[chief editor]], he began publishing an [[bibuła|underground]] socialist newspaper, ''[[Robotnik (1894–1939)|Robotnik]]'' (The Worker); he would also be one of its chief writers, and, initially, a [[typesetter]].{{r|PolandGov|PWN|Urbank97_93}}{{sfn|Piłsudski|1989|p=12}} In 1895, he became a PPS leader and took the position that doctrinal issues were of minor importance and that socialist ideology should be merged with nationalist ideology, since that combination offered the greatest chance of restoring Polish independence.{{r|PWN}}

On 15 July 1899, while an underground organizer, Piłsudski married a fellow socialist organizer, [[Maria Piłsudska|Maria Juszkiewiczowa, ''née'' Koplewska]].{{r|Alabrud99_99|Garlicki195_63|Pobog-Ma90_7}} According to his chief biographer, Wacław Jędrzejewicz, the marriage was less romantic than pragmatic in nature. Both were very involved in the socialist and independence movements. The printing press of "Robotnik" was in their apartment first in [[Vilnius|Wilno]], then in [[Łódź]]. Having a pretext of regular family life made them less subject to suspicion. Russian law also protected a wife from prosecution for the illegal activities of her husband.{{sfn|Jędrzejewicz|1990|loc=pp. 27-8 (1982 ed.)}} The marriage deteriorated when, several years later, Piłsudski began an affair with a younger socialist,{{r|McM03_209}} [[Aleksandra Piłsudska|Aleksandra Szczerbińska]]. Maria died in 1921, and in October that year Piłsudski married Aleksandra. By then the couple had two daughters, [[Wanda Piłsudska|Wanda]] and [[Jadwiga Piłsudska|Jadwiga]].

[[File:Lingwood 1898.jpg|thumb|left|"Lingwood", [[Leytonstone]], where Piłsudski stayed in 1900]]
In February 1900, after Russian authorities found ''Robotnik'''s underground printing press in [[Łódź]], Piłsudski was imprisoned at the [[Warsaw Citadel]]. But, after feigning mental illness in May 1901, he managed to escape from a mental hospital at [[Saint Petersburg]] with the help of a Polish physician, [[Władysław Mazurkiewicz (physician)|Władysław Mazurkiewicz]], and others, fleeing to [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]] and thence to [[Leytonstone]] in London where he stayed with [[Leon Wasilewski]] and his family.{{r|PolandGov}}

At the time, when almost all parties in Russian Poland and Lithuania took a conciliatory position toward the Russian Empire and aimed at negotiating within it a limited autonomy for Poland, Piłsudski's PPS was the only political force that was prepared to fight the Empire for Polish independence and to resort to violence in order to achieve that goal.{{r|POleksa04}}

On the outbreak of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–1905), in the summer of 1904, Piłsudski traveled to [[Tokyo]], Japan, where he tried unsuccessfully to obtain that country's assistance for an uprising in Poland. He offered to supply Japan with [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] in support of its war with Russia, and proposed the creation of a Polish Legion from Poles,{{r|Urbank97_109–11}} conscripted into the Russian Army, who had been captured by Japan. He also suggested a [[Prometheism#Sources of Prometheism|"Promethean" project]] directed at breaking up the Russian Empire, a goal that he later continued to pursue.{{sfn|Charaszkiewicz|2000|p=56}} Meeting with [[Yamagata Aritomo]], he suggested that starting a [[guerrilla war]] in Poland would distract Russia and asked for Japan to supply him with weapons. Although the Japanese diplomat [[Hayashi Tadasu]] supported the plan, the Japanese government, including Yamagata, was more skeptical.{{sfn|Kowner|2006|p=285}}

Piłsudski's arch-rival [[Roman Dmowski]] travelled to Japan, where he argued against Piłsudski's plan, endeavoring to discourage the Japanese government from supporting a Polish revolution, which Dmowski felt would then be doomed to failure.{{r|Urbank97_109–11|Zamo87_330}} Dmowski, himself a Polish patriot, would remain Piłsudski's political archenemy to the end of Piłsudski's life.{{r|Zamo87_332}} In the end, the Japanese offered Piłsudski much less than he had hoped for; he received Japan's help in purchasing weapons and ammunition for the PPS and its combat organisation, and the Japanese declined the Legion proposal.{{r|PolandGov|Urbank97_109–11}}

In the fall of 1904, Piłsudski formed a paramilitary unit (the [[Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party]], or ''bojówki'') aiming to create an armed [[resistance movement]] against the Russian authorities.{{r|Zamo87_330}} The PPS organized an increasing numbers of demonstrations, mainly in [[Warsaw]]; on 28 October 1904, Russian [[Cossack]] [[cavalry]] attacked a demonstration, and in reprisal, during a demonstration on 13 November Piłsudski's paramilitary opened fire on Russian police and military.{{r|Zamo87_330|Urbank97_113–6}} Initially concentrating their attention on spies and informers, in March 1905 the paramilitary began using bombs to assassinate selected Russian police officers.{{r|Urbank97_117–8}}

During the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], Piłsudski played a leading role in events in [[Congress Poland]]. In early 1905 he ordered the PPS to launch a general strike there; it involved some 400,000 workers and lasted two months until it was broken by the Russian authorities.{{r|Zamo87_330}} In June 1905, Piłsudski sent paramilitary aid to an uprising in [[Łódź]]. During the "[[Łódź insurrection (1905)|June Days]]", as the Łódź uprising came to be known, armed clashes broke out between Piłsudski's paramilitaries and gunmen loyal to Dmowski and his [[National Democracy|National Democrats]].{{r|Zamo87_330}} On 22 December 1905, Piłsudski called for all Polish workers to rise up; the call went largely unheeded.{{r|Zamo87_330}}

Unlike the National Democrats, Piłsudski instructed the PPS to boycott the elections to the [[First Duma]].{{r|Zamo87_330}} The decision and his resolve to try to win Polish independence through uprisings caused tensions within the PPS, and in November 1906, the party fractured over Piłsudski's leadership.{{r|Zamo87_332}} His faction came to be called the "Old Faction" or "Revolutionary Faction" ("''Starzy''" or "''[[Polish Socialist Party – Revolutionary Faction|Frakcja Rewolucyjna]]''"), while their opponents were known as the "Young Faction", "Moderate Faction" or "Left Wing" ("''Młodzi''", "''Frakcja Umiarkowana''", "''[[Polish Socialist Party – Left|Lewica]]''"). The "Young" sympathized with the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania|Social Democrats of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] and believed that priority should be given to co-operation with Russian revolutionaries in toppling the tsarist regime and creating a socialist [[utopia]] that would facilitate negotiations for independence.{{r|PWN}}

Piłsudski and his supporters in the Revolutionary Faction continued to plot a revolution against Tsarist Russia that would secure Polish independence.{{r|PolandGov}} By 1909, his faction would again be the majority in the PPS, and Piłsudski would remain one of the most important PPS leaders until the outbreak of the First World War.{{r|Urbank97_131}}

Piłsudski anticipated a coming European war{{r|Roos+Rothschild}} and the need to organize the nucleus of a future Polish Army, which could help win Poland's independence from the three empires that had partitioned it out of political existence in the late 18th century. In 1906 Piłsudski, with the connivance of the Austrian authorities, founded a military school in [[Kraków]] for the training of paramilitary units.{{r|Zamo87_332}} In 1906 alone, the 800-strong paramilitaries, operating in five-man teams in Congress Poland, killed 336 Russian officials; in subsequent years, the number of their casualties declined, and the paramilitaries' numbers increased to some 2,000 in 1908.{{r|Zamo87_332|Urbank97_121–2}}

The paramilitaries also held up Russian currency transports that were leaving Polish territories. On the night of 26/27 September 1908, they robbed a Russian mail train that was carrying tax revenues from Warsaw to Saint Petersburg.{{r|Zamo87_332}} Piłsudski, who took part in this [[Bezdany raid]] near Vilnius, used the funds thus "expropriated" to finance his secret military organization.{{r|EBritannica_JP}} The take from that single raid (200,812 rubles) was a fortune for the time and equaled the paramilitaries' entire takes of the two preceding years.{{r|Urbank97_121–2}}

[[File:Józef Piłsudski with Supreme Command of Polish Military Organisation in 1917.PNG|266px|thumb|right|Józef Piłsudski with Supreme Command of [[Polish Military Organisation]] in 1917]]

In 1908, Piłsudski transformed his paramilitary units into an "Association for Active Struggle" (''[[Związek Walki Czynnej]]'', or ''ZWC''), headed by three of his associates, [[Władysław Sikorski]], [[Marian Kukiel]] and [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]].{{r|Zamo87_332}} One of the ''ZWC'''s main purposes was to train officers and [[noncommissioned officer]]s for a future Polish Army.{{r|PWN}}

In 1910, two legal paramilitary organizations were created in the Austrian zone of Poland, one in Lwów (now [[Lviv]], Ukraine) and one in [[Kraków]], to conduct training in [[military science]]. With the permission of the Austrian authorities, Piłsudski founded a series of "sporting clubs", then the [[Związek Strzelecki|Riflemen's Association]], which served as cover to train a Polish military force. In 1912 Piłsudski (using the ''[[nom de guerre]]'', "''Mieczysław''") became commander-in-chief of a Riflemen's Association (''Związek Strzelecki'') that grew by 1914 to 12,000 men.{{r|PolandGov|Zamo87_332}} In 1914, Piłsudski declared, "Only the sword now carries any weight in the balance for the destiny of a nation."{{r|Zamo87_332}}

==World War I==
[[File:Jozef Pilsudski3.jpg|thumb|right|Piłsudski in uniform]]
{{Main|World War I}}
At a meeting in Paris in 1914, Piłsudski presciently declared that in the impending war, for Poland to regain independence, Russia must be beaten by the Central Powers (the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires), and the latter powers must in their turn be beaten by [[French Third Republic|France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and the United States.{{r|Roos+Rothschild}} By contrast, [[Roman Dmowski]], Piłsudski's rival, believed that the best way to achieve a unified and independent Poland was to support the [[Triple Entente]] against the Central Powers.{{r|Zamo87_333}}
[[File:Jozef  Pilsudski2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Piłsudski in World War I (1914)]]
At the outbreak of the war on 3 August in [[Kraków]], Piłsudski formed a small [[En cadre|cadre]] military unit, the [[First Cadre Company]], from members of the [[Riflemen's Association]] and [[Polish Rifle Squads]].{{r|Urbank97_171–2}} That same day, [[The Seven Lancers of Belina|a cavalry unit]] under [[Władysław Belina-Prażmowski]] was sent to [[reconnoitre]] across the Russian border even before the official [[declaration of war]] between Austria-Hungary and Russia, which ensued on 6 August.{{r|Urbank97_168}}

Piłsudski's strategy was to send his forces north across the border into [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]] into an area that the [[Military history of Imperial Russia|Russian Army]] had evacuated in the hope of breaking through to Warsaw and sparking a national uprising.{{r|PWN|Cienciala02}} Using his limited forces in those early days, he backed his orders with the sanction of a fictitious "National Government in Warsaw",{{r|Urbank97_174–5}} and he bent and stretched Austrian orders to the utmost, taking initiatives, moving forward and establishing Polish institutions in liberated towns while the Austrians saw his forces as good only for scouting or for supporting main Austrian formations.{{r|Urbank97_178–9}} On 12 August 1914, Piłsudski's forces took the town of [[Kielce]], of [[Kielce Governorate]], but Piłsudski found the populace less supportive than he had expected.{{r|Urbank97_170–1_180–2}}

Soon afterward he officially established the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]], taking personal command of their [[I Brigade of the Polish Legions|First Brigade]],{{r|PolandGov}} which he would lead successfully into several victorious battles.{{r|PWN}} He also secretly informed the British government in the fall of 1914 that his Legions would never fight France or Britain, only Russia.{{r|Cienciala02}}
[[File:Pilsudski and officers 1915.jpg|thumb|left|Piłsudski and his officers, 1915]]
Piłsudski decreed that Legions' personnel were to be addressed by the [[French Revolution]]-inspired "Citizen" (''Obywatel''), and he was referred to as "the Commandant" ("''Komendant''").{{r|Zamo87_333}} Piłsudski enjoyed extreme respect and loyalty from his men,{{r|Zamo87_333}} which would remain for years to come. The Polish Legions fought against Russia, at the side of the Central Powers, until 1917.

Soon after forming the Legions, also in 1914, Piłsudski set up another organization, the [[Polish Military Organisation]] (''Polska Organizacja Wojskowa''), which served as a precursor [[Polish intelligence]] agency and was designed to perform espionage and sabotage missions.{{r|PWN|Cienciala02}}
[[File:Jacek Malczewski, Portret brygadiera Józefa Piłsudskiego.jpg|thumb|Piłsudski. Painting by [[Jacek Malczewski]], 1916]]
In mid-1916, after the [[Battle of Kostiuchnówka]] (4–6 July 1916), in which the Polish Legions delayed a Russian offensive at a cost of over 2,000 casualties,{{sfn|Rąkowski|2005|pp=109-11}} Piłsudski demanded for the Central Powers to issue a guarantee of independence for Poland. He backed that demand with his own proffered [[resignation]] and that of many of the Legions' officers.{{r|Urbank97_251–2}} On 5 November 1916 the Central Powers proclaimed the "independence" of Poland, hoping to increase the number of Polish troops that could be sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] against Russia, thereby relieving German forces to bolster the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].{{r|EBritannica_JP|Biskupski2000}}

Piłsudski agreed to serve in the [[Kingdom of Poland (1916–1918)|Regency Kingdom of Poland]], created by the Central Powers, and acted as [[minister of war]] in the newly formed [[Polish Regency government]]; as such, he was responsible for the [[Polnische Wehrmacht]].{{r|Zamo87_333}} After the [[February Revolution|Russian Revolution in early 1917]], and in view of the worsening situation of the Central Powers, Piłsudski took an increasingly uncompromising stance, insisting that his men no longer be treated as "German [[colonial troops]]" and but be used to fight only Russia. Anticipating the Central Powers' defeat in the war, he did not wish to be allied with the losing side.{{r|Rothschild90_45|Urbank97_253}} In the aftermath of a July 1917 "[[Oath Crisis]]" when Piłsudski forbade Polish soldiers to swear a [[loyalty oath]] to the Central Powers, he was arrested and imprisoned at [[Magdeburg]]; the Polish units were disbanded and the men were incorporated into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]{{r|PolandGov|Cienciala02}} while the [[Polish Military Organization]] began attacking German targets.{{r|PWN}} Piłsudski's arrest greatly enhanced his reputation among Poles, many of whom began to see him as the most determined Polish leader, who was willing to take on  all the partitioning powers.{{r|PWN}}

On 8 November 1918, three days before the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice]], Piłsudski and his colleague, Colonel [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]], were released by the Germans from Magdeburg and soon, like [[Vladimir Lenin]] before them, placed on a private train, bound for their national capital, as the collapsing Germans hoped that Piłsudski would create a force that was friendly to them.{{r|Cienciala02}}

==Rebuilding Poland==

[[File:Polski automobil pancerny z obrony Lwowa 1918-19.JPG|thumb|''Piłsudski'' improvised armored car, 1919, named after Piłsudski]]
On 11 November 1918 in Warsaw, Piłsudski was appointed [[Commander in Chief]] of Polish forces by the [[Regency Council (Poland)|Regency Council]] and was entrusted with creating a national government for the newly independent country. On that very day, which would become [[Poland's Independence Day]], he proclaimed an independent Polish state.{{r|Cienciala02}}

That week too, Piłsudski also negotiated the evacuation of the German garrison from Warsaw and of other German troops from the "[[Ober Ost]]" authority. Over 55,000 Germans would peacefully depart Poland, leaving their weapons to the Poles. In coming months, over 400,000 total would depart Polish territories.{{r|Cienciala02|Urbank97_256_277–8}}

On 14 November 1918, Piłsudski was asked to supervise provisionally the running of the country. On 22 November he officially received, from the new government of [[Jędrzej Moraczewski]], the title of Provisional Chief of State (''Naczelnik Państwa'') of renascent Poland.{{r|PolandGov}}

Various Polish military organizations and provisional governments (the [[Regency Council (Poland)|Regency Council]] in Warsaw; [[Ignacy Daszyński]]'s government in [[Lublin]]; and the [[Polish Liquidation Committee]] in [[Kraków]]) bowed to Piłsudski, who set about forming a new coalition government. It was predominantly socialist and introduced many reforms long proclaimed as necessary by the Polish Socialist Party, such as the [[eight-hour day]], free school education and [[women's suffrage]], to avoid major unrest.

However, Piłsudski believed that as head of state, he must be above partisan politics.{{r|PWN|Cienciala02}} The day after his arrival in Warsaw, he met with old colleagues from underground days, who addressed him socialist-style as "[[Comrade]]" ("''Towarzysz''") and asked for his support for their revolutionary policies; he refused it and answered: "Comrades, I took the red [[tram]] of socialism to the stop called Independence, and that's where I got off. You may keep on to the final stop if you wish, but from now on let's address each other as '[[Slavic honorifics|Mister']] [rather than continue using the socialist term of address, 'Comrade']!"{{r|PolandGov}} He declined to support any party and did not form any political organization of his own; instead, he advocated creating a coalition government.{{r|PWN|Suleja04_202}} He also set about organizing a Polish army out of Polish veterans of the German, Russian and Austrian armies.

In the days immediately after the war, Piłsudski attempted to build a government in a shattered country. Much of former Russian Poland had been destroyed in the war, and systematic looting by the Germans had reduced the region's wealth by at least 10%.{{r|McM03_210}} A British diplomat who visited Warsaw in January 1919 reported: "I have nowhere seen anything like the evidences of extreme poverty and wretchedness that meet one's eye at almost every turn."{{r|McM03_210}}

In addition, the country had to unify the disparate systems of law, economics, and [[administration (government)|administration]] in the former German, Austrian, and Russian sectors of Poland. There were nine legal systems, five currencies, and 66 types of rail systems (with 165 models of locomotives), which all had to be consolidated on an expedited basis.{{r|McM03_210}}
[[File:Warszawaid4.jpg|thumb|Statue of Piłsudski before Warsaw's [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]], Piłsudski's official residence during his years in power]]

[[Wacław Jędrzejewicz]], in ''Piłsudski: A Life for Poland'', described Piłsudski as very deliberate in his decision-making:  Piłsudski collected all available pertinent information, then took his time weighing it before arriving at a final decision.  He drove himself hard, working all day and all night.{{r|McM03_210}} He maintained a simple lifestyle, eating plain meals alone at an inexpensive restaurant.{{r|McM03_210}} Though he was popular with much of the Polish public, his reputation as a loner (the result of many years' underground work) and as a man who distrusted almost everyone led to strained relations with other Polish politicians.{{r|McM03_209}}

Piłsudski and the first Polish government were distrusted in the West because he had co-operated with the Central Powers in 1914 to 1917 and because the governments of Daszyński and Jędrzej Moraczewski were primarily socialist.{{r|Cienciala02}} It was not until January 1919, when the world-famous pianist and composer [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] became [[Prime Minister of Poland]] and foreign minister of a new government, that it was recognized in the West.{{r|Cienciala02}}

That still left two separate governments claiming to be Poland's legitimate government: Piłsudski's in Warsaw and Dmowski's in Paris.{{r|McM03_210}} To ensure that Poland had a single government and to avert civil war, Paderewski met with Dmowski and Piłsudski and persuaded them to join forces, with Piłsudski acting as Provisional Chief of State and [[Commander-in-Chief]] while Dmowski and Paderewski represented Poland at the [[Paris Peace Conference of 1919|Paris Peace Conference]].{{r|McM03_213-4}} Articles 87–93 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]{{r|VersaillesTreaty1919_87-93}} and the [[Little Treaty of Versailles]], signed on 28 June 1919, formally established Poland as an independent and sovereign state in the international arena.{{r|Grant99_114}}

[[File:PL Turek Pilsudski Monument 11.jpg|thumb|[[Józef Piłsudski monument, Turek|Piłsudski monument]], [[Turek]] (designed in 1936)]]
Piłsudski often clashed with Dmowski for viewing the Poles as the dominant nationality in renascent Poland, and attempting to send the [[Blue Army (Poland)|Blue Army]] to Poland through Danzig, Germany (now [[Gdańsk]], Poland).{{r|McM03_211-214|Boemeke98_314}} On 5 January 1919, some of Dmowski's supporters ([[Marian Januszajtis-Żegota]] and [[Eustachy Sapieha]]) attempted [[Polish Coup (1919)|a coup]] against Piłsudski and Prime Minister Moraczewski, but they failed.{{r|Urbank97_499–501}}

On 20 February 1919, Piłsudski declared that he would return his powers to the newly elected Polish parliament (''[[Sejm]]''). However, the ''Sejm'' reinstated his office in the [[Little Constitution of 1919]]. The word "Provisional" was struck from his title, and Piłsudski would hold the office until 9 December 1922, when [[Gabriel Narutowicz]] was elected as the first [[president of Poland]].{{r|PolandGov}}

Piłsudski's major foreign policy initiative was then a proposed federation (to be called ''"[[Międzymorze]]"'' ([[Polish language|Polish]] for "Between-Seas"), and also known from the [[Latin]] as ''[[Intermarium]]'', stretching from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Black Sea]]). It was to consist of Poland, the independent [[Baltic states]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]],{{r|Cienciala02}} somewhat in emulation of the [[partitions of Poland|pre-partition]] [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].{{r|PWN}}{{sfn|Jędrzejewicz|1990|p=93}}

Piłsudski's plan met with opposition from most of the prospective member states, which refused to relinquish any of their hard-won independence, as well as from the Allied powers, who thought it to be too bold a change to the existing [[balance of power in international relations|balance-of-power]] structure.{{r|HistNet_01}} According to historian [[George Sanford (scholar)|George Sanford]], it was around 1920 that Piłsudski came to realize the infeasibility of that version of his Intermarium project.{{sfn|Sanford|2002|pp=5-6}}

Instead of a Central and Eastern European alliance, there soon appeared a series of border conflicts, including the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]] (1918–19), the [[Polish-Lithuanian War]] (1920, culminating in [[Żeligowski's Mutiny]]), [[Polish-Czechoslovak border conflicts]] (beginning in 1918), and most notably the Polish-Soviet War (1919–21).{{r|PWN}} [[Winston Churchill]] commented, "The war of giants has ended, the wars of the pygmies begun."{{r|HydeP01_75}}

==Polish–Soviet War==
[[File:Josef Pilsudski cph.3b35372.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Piłsudski around 1919]]
{{Main|Polish–Soviet War}}
[[File:Jozef Pilsudski w Poznaniu.jpg|thumb|right|Piłsudski in [[Poznań]]]]
In the [[aftermath of World War I]], there was unrest on all Polish borders. Regarding Poland's future frontiers, Piłsudski said, "All that we can gain in the west depends on the Entente—on the extent to which it may wish to squeeze Germany". In the east, "there are doors that open and close, and it depends on who forces them open and how far".{{r|McM03_211}} In 1918 in the east, Polish forces clashed with Ukrainian forces in the Polish–Ukrainian War, and Piłsudski's first orders as Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army, on 12 November 1918, were to provide support for the [[Battle of Lwów (1918)|Polish struggle in Lviv]].{{r|Urbank97_281}}

Piłsudski was aware that the Bolsheviks were no friends of independent Poland and that war with them was inevitable.{{r|Urbank97_2_90}} He viewed their advance west as a major problem, but he also considered the Bolsheviks less dangerous for Poland than their [[White movement|White opponents]].{{r|Kenez99_37}} The "White Russians",  representatives of the old Russian Empire, were willing to accept only limited independence for Poland, probably within borders similar to those of the former [[Congress Poland]], and they clearly objected to Polish control of Ukraine, which was crucial for Piłsudski's Intermarium project.{{r|Urbank97_2_83}}

That was in contrast to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void.{{r|Urbank97_291}} Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire.{{r|Kenez99_37|Urbank97_2_45}} By ignoring the strong pressures from the [[Entente Cordiale]] to join the attack on Lenin's struggling Bolshevik government, Piłsudski probably saved it in the summer and the fall of 1919.{{r|Urbank97_2_92}}

[[File:Jozef Pilsudski.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In March 1920, Piłsudski was made "First [[Marshal of Poland]]".]]
In the wake of the [[Russian westward offensive of 1918–1919]] and of a series of escalating battles that resulted in the Poles advancing eastward, on 21 April 1920, [[Marshal]] Piłsudski (as his rank had been since March 1920) signed a military alliance (the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]]) with Ukrainian leader [[Symon Petliura]] to conduct joint operations against [[Soviet Russia]]. The goal of the Polish-Ukrainian Treaty was to establish an independent Ukraine and independent Poland in alliance, resembling that once existing within [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]{{r|Davies03_95ff}} In return, Petliura gave up Ukrainian claims to western lands of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] being a historical part of the [[Crown of Poland]] for which he was denounced by Ukrainian nationalist leaders.{{r|Cienciala02}}

The Polish and the Ukrainian Armies, under Piłsudski's command, launched [[1920 Kiev Offensive|a successful offensive]] against the Russian forces in Ukraine. On 7 May 1920, with remarkably little fighting, they captured [[Kiev]].{{r|Davies03_00}}
[[File:Pilsudski and Rydz-Smigly.jpg|thumb|right|Piłsudski ''(left)'' and [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]] ''(right)'', 1920, during Polish-Soviet War]]
The Bolshevik leadership framed the Polish actions as an invasion; in response, thousands of officers and deserters joined the Red Army, and thousands of civilians volunteered for war work.{{r|Figes96_699}} The Soviets launched a counter-offensive from [[Belarus]] and [[counterattack]]ed in Ukraine, advancing into Poland{{r|Davies03_00}} in a drive toward Germany to encourage the [[Communist Party of Germany]] in its struggle to take power. Soviet confidence soared.{{r|Lenin1920}} The Soviets announced their plans to invade Western Europe; Soviet communist theoretician [[Nikolai Bukharin]], writing in ''[[Pravda]]'', hoped for the resources to carry the campaign beyond Warsaw "straight to London and Paris".{{r|CohenS80_101}} Soviet commander [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]]'s order of the day for 2 July 1920 read: "To the West! Over the corpse of White Poland lies the road to worldwide conflagration. March upon [[Vilnius]], [[Minsk]], Warsaw!"{{r|Lawrynowicz}} and "onward to Berlin over the corpse of Poland!"{{r|Cienciala02}}

On 1 July 1920, in view of the rapidly advancing Soviet offensive, Poland's parliament, the ''[[Sejm]]'', formed a [[Council for Defense of the Nation]],  chaired by Piłsudski, to provide expeditious decision-making as a temporary supplanting of the fractious [[Sejm]].{{r|Urbank97_341–6_357–8}} The [[National Democracy|National Democrats]], however, contended that the string of Bolshevik victories had been Piłsudski's fault{{r|Suleja04_265}} and demanded that for him to resign; some even accused him of treason.{{r|Urbank97_341–6}} Their 19 July failure to carry a [[vote of no-confidence]] in the council led to Dmowski's withdrawal from it.{{r|Urbank97_341–6}} On 12 August, Piłsudski tendered his resignation to Prime Minister [[Wincenty Witos]], offering to be the scapegoat if the military solution failed, but Witos refused to accept his resignation.{{r|Urbank97_341–6}} The Entente pressured Poland to surrender and enter into negotiations with the Bolsheviks. Piłsudski, however, was a staunch advocate of continuing the fight.{{r|Urbank97_341–6}} As [[Norman Davies]] noted, at that time, especially abroad, "Piłsudski had nothing of his later prestige. As a pre-war revolutionary he led his party to splits and quarrels; as a general in World War I he led his legions to internment and disbanding; as a marshal of the Polish Army he led it to Kiev and Vilnius, both now lost to Poles. He left the Polish Socialist Party and his Austro-German allies; refused to ally himself with Entente. In France and England he was considered a treasonous ally who leads Poland into destruction; in Russia he was seen as a false servant of the allies, who will lead imperialism to ruin. All&amp;nbsp;– from Lenin to [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]], from ''[[Pravda]]'' to ''[[Morning Star (UK newspaper)|Morning Star]]''&amp;nbsp;– considered him a military and political failure. In August 1920 all were in agreement that his catastrophic career will be crowned with the fall of Warsaw".{{r|Davies03_225}}
[[File:Piłsudski nad Nidą (22-132).jpg|thumb|left|Piłsudski with his favorite horse, ''[[Kasztanka|Chestnut]]'' (''Kasztanka'')]]
However, over the next few weeks, Poland's risky, unconventional strategy at the August 1920 [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]] halted the Soviet advance.{{r|Davies03_00}} The Polish plan was developed by Piłsudski and others, including [[Tadeusz Rozwadowski]].{{r|Erickson01_95}} Later, some supporters of Piłsudski would seek to portray him as the sole author of the Polish strategy, but opponents would seek to minimize his role.{{r|LönnrothEt94_230}} In the West for a long time a myth persisted that it was General [[Maxime Weygand]] of the [[French Military Mission to Poland]] who had saved Poland; modern scholars, however, are in agreement that Weygand's role was minimal, at best.{{r|Cienciala02|LönnrothEt94_230|Szczep}}

Piłsudski's plan called for Polish forces to withdraw across the [[Vistula River]] and to defend the bridgeheads at Warsaw and on the [[Wieprz River]] while some 25% of the available [[division (military)|divisions]] concentrated to the south for a strategic counteroffensive. The plan next required two armies under General [[Józef Haller de Hallenburg|Józef Haller]], facing Soviet frontal attack on Warsaw from the east, to hold their [[trench|entrenched]] positions at all costs. At the same time, an army under General [[Władysław Sikorski]] was to strike north from outside Warsaw, cutting off Soviet forces that sought to envelope the Polish capital from that direction. The most important role, however, was assigned to a relatively small, approximately 20,000-man, newly assembled "Reserve Army" (also known as the "Strike Group", "''Grupa Uderzeniowa''"), comprising the most determined, battle-hardened Polish units that were commanded personally by Piłsudski. Their task was to spearhead a lightning northward offensive, from the Vistula-Wieprz triangle south of Warsaw, through a weak spot that had been identified by Polish intelligence between the Soviet Western and Southwestern [[Front (Soviet Army)|Fronts]]. That offensive would separate the Soviet Western Front from its reserves and disorganize its movements. Eventually, the gap between Sikorski's army and the "Strike Group" would close near the [[East Prussia]]n border, bringing about the destruction of the encircled Soviet forces.{{r|Cisek02_1401|Urbank97_346-441_357-8}}

At the time, Piłsudski's plan was strongly criticized, and only the desperate situation of the Polish forces persuaded other commanders to go along with it. Though based on reliable intelligence, including [[decryption|decrypted]] Soviet radio communications, the plan was termed "amateurish" by high-ranking army officers and military experts, who were quick to point out Piłsudski's lack of formal military education. When a copy of the plan fell into Soviet hands, Western Front commander [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] thought it to be a ruse and disregarded it.{{sfn|Davies|2003|p=197}} Days later, the Soviets paid dearly for that when, during the Battle of Warsaw, the overconfident [[Red Army]] suffered one of its greatest defeats ever.{{r|Davies03_00|Urbank97_346-441_357-8}}

A National Democrat ''[[Sejm]]'' deputy, [[Stanisław Stroński]], coined the phrase, "Miracle at the Vistula" ("''Cud nad Wisłą''"),{{r|Głos05}} to express his disapproval of Piłsudski's "Ukrainian adventure". Stroński's phrase was adopted as praise for Piłsudski by some patriotically- or piously-minded Poles, who were unaware of Stroński's ironic intent. A junior member of the French military mission, [[Charles de Gaulle]], would later adopt some lessons from the Polish-Soviet War as well as from Piłsudski's career.{{r|Urbank97_346-441_357-8}}{{sfn|Davies|1998|p=935}}

In February 1921, Piłsudski visited Paris, where, in negotiations with French President [[Alexandre Millerand]], he laid the foundations for the [[Franco-Polish Military Alliance]], which would be signed later that year.{{r|Urbank97_484}} The [[Treaty of Riga]], which ended the Polish-Soviet War in March 1921, partitioned [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]] between Poland and Russia. Piłsudski called the treaty an "act of cowardice".{{sfn|Davies|2005|loc=p. 399 (1982 ed. Columbia Univ. Press - ISBN 978-0-231-05352-5)}} The treaty and his secret approval of General [[Lucjan Żeligowski]]'s [[Żeligowski's Mutiny|capture of Vilnius]] from the Lithuanians marked an end to this incarnation of Piłsudski's federalist [[Intermarium]] plan.{{r|PWN}}

On 25 September 1921, when Piłsudski visited Lwów (now [[Lviv]]) for the opening of the first [[Eastern Trade Fair]] (''Targi Wschodnie''), he was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt by [[Stepan Fedak]], acting on behalf of Ukrainian-independence organizations, including the [[Ukrainian Military Organization]].{{r|Urbank97_485}}

==Retirement and coup==

After the Polish [[March Constitution (Poland)|Constitution of March 1921]] severely limited the powers of the [[presidency]] intentionally, to prevent a President Piłsudski from waging war. He declined to run for the office.{{r|PWN}} On 9 December 1922, the Polish [[National Assembly of the Republic of Poland|National Assembly]] elected [[Gabriel Narutowicz]] of [[Polish People's Party "Wyzwolenie"]]; his election, opposed by the right-wing parties, caused public unrest.{{r|Urbank97_487-8}} On 14 December at the [[Belweder]] Palace, Piłsudski officially transferred his powers as Chief of State to his friend Narutowicz; the ''Naczelnik'' was replaced by the President.{{r|Urbank97_488|EBritannica_JP}}
[[File:Pilsudski in Bristol.jpg|thumb|right|At Warsaw's [[Hotel Bristol, Warsaw|Hotel Bristol]], 3 July 1923, Piłsudski announced his retirement from active politics.]]
Two days later, on 16 December 1922, Narutowicz was shot dead by a right-wing painter and art critic, [[Eligiusz Niewiadomski]], who had originally wanted to kill Piłsudski but had changed his target, influenced by National Democrat anti-Narutowicz propaganda.{{r|Urbank97_489}}

For Piłsudski, that was a major shock, which shook his belief that Poland could function as a democracy{{r|Suleja04_300}} and made him support government by a strong hand.{{sfn|Davies|1986|p=140}} He became [[Chief of the General Staff (Poland)|Chief of the General Staff]] and, together with [[Polish Minister of Military Affairs|Minister of Military Affairs]] [[Władysław Sikorski]], managed to stabilize the situation, quelling unrest with a brief [[state of emergency]].{{r|Urbank97_489–90}}

[[Stanisław Wojciechowski]] of [[Polish People's Party "Piast" (1913–31)|Polish People's Party "Piast"]] (PSL Piast), another of Piłsudski's old colleagues, was elected the new president, and [[Wincenty Witos]], also of PSL Piast, became prime minister. However, the new government, pursuant to the [[Lanckorona Pact]], an alliance among the centrist PSL Piast and the right-wing [[Popular National Union]] and [[Polskie Stronnictwo Chrześcijańskiej Demokracji|Christian Democrat]] parties, contained right-wing enemies of Piłsudski, people whom he held morally responsible for Narutowicz's death and with whom he found it impossible to work.{{r|Urbank97_490–1}} On 30 May 1923, Piłsudski resigned as Chief of the General Staff.
[[File:Dworek w Sulejówku.jpg|thumb|right|Piłsudski in front of his [[Sulejówek]] house, with his former soldiers, before the 1926 coup]]
After General [[Stanisław Szeptycki]] proposed that the military should be more closely supervised by civilian authorities, Piłsudski criticized that as an attempt to politicize the army, and on 28 June, he resigned his last political appointment. The same day, the Sejm's left-wing deputies voted a resolution, thanking him for his past work.{{r|Urbank97_490}} Piłsudski went into retirement in [[Sulejówek]], outside Warsaw, at his country manor, ''"Milusin"'', which had been presented to him by his former soldiers.{{sfn|Watt|1979|p=210}} There, he settled down to supporting his family by writing a series of political and military memoirs, including ''Rok 1920'' (The Year 1920).{{r|PolandGov}}

Meanwhile, Poland's economy was in shambles. [[Hyperinflation]] fueled public unrest, and the government was unable to find a quick solution to the mounting unemployment and economic crisis.{{r|Urbank97_502}} Piłsudski's allies and supporters repeatedly asked him to return to politics, and he began to create a new power base, centred on former members of the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]] and the [[Polish Military Organization]] as well as some left-wing and [[intelligentsia]] parties. In 1925, after several governments had resigned in short order and the political scene was becoming increasingly chaotic, Piłsudski became more and more critical of the government and eventually issued statements demanding the resignation of the Witos cabinet.{{r|PolandGov|PWN}}

When the [[Chjeno-Piast]] coalition, which Piłsudski had strongly criticized, formed a new government,{{r|PWN}} on 12–14 May 1926, Piłsudski returned to power in a ''coup d'état'' (the [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]]), supported by the Polish Socialist Party, [[Polish People's Party "Wyzwolenie"|Liberation]], the [[Stronnictwo Chłopskie|Peasant Party]] and even the [[Communist Party of Poland|Polish Communist Party]].{{r|Urbank97_515}} Piłsudski had hoped for a bloodless coup, but the government had refused to back down;{{r|Suleja04_343}} 215 soldiers and 164 civilians had been killed, and over 900 persons had been wounded.{{sfn|Roszkowski|1992|loc= p. 53, section 5.1}}

==In government==
On 31 May, the ''[[Sejm]]'' elected Piłsudski president of the Republic. Piłsudski, however, aware of the presidency's limited powers, refused the office. Another of his old friends, [[Ignacy Mościcki]], was elected in his stead. Mościcki then appointed Piłsudski as [[Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Poland|Minister of Military Affairs]] (defence minister), a post that he would hold for the rest of his life in 11 successive governments, two of which he headed himself from 1926 to 1928 and for a brief period in 1930. He also served as [[General Inspector of the Armed Forces]], and Chairman of The War Council.{{r|PolandGov}}

Piłsudski had no plans for major reforms; he quickly distanced himself from the most radical of his left-wing supporters and declared that his coup was to be a "revolution without revolutionary consequences".{{r|PWN}} His goals were to stabilize the country; reduce the influence of political parties, which he blamed for corruption and inefficiency; and strengthen the army.{{r|PWN|Urbank97_528–9}} His role in the Polish government over the subsequent years has been called a dictatorship or a "quasi-dictatorship".&lt;{{sfn|Biskupski|2012|p=46}}

===Internal politics===
[[File:5 Warszawa 083.jpg|thumb|right|[[Belweder|Belweder Palace]], Warsaw, Piłsudski's official residence during his years in power]]

In internal politics, Piłsudski's coup entailed sweeping limitations on parliamentary government, as his [[Sanacja|Sanation]] regime (1926–1939), at times employing authoritarian methods, sought to "restore public life to moral health". From 1928, the Sanation authorities were represented in the sphere of practical politics by the [[Non-partisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government]] (''BBWR''). Popular support and an effective propaganda apparatus allowed Piłsudski to maintain his authoritarian powers, which could not be overruled either by the president, who was appointed by Piłsudski, or by the ''[[Sejm]]''.{{r|PolandGov}} The powers of the ''Sejm'' were curtailed by [[August Novelization|constitutional amendments]] that were introduced soon after the coup, on 2 August 1926.{{r|PolandGov}} From 1926 to 1930, Piłsudski relied chiefly on propaganda to weaken the influence of opposition leaders.{{r|PWN}}

The culmination of his dictatorial and supralegal policies came in the 1930s, with the imprisonment and trial of certain political opponents (the [[Brest trial]]s) on the eve of the 1930 [[Polish legislative election, 1930|legislative elections]] and with the 1934 establishment of a [[Bereza Kartuska Detention Camp|prison]] for political prisoners at Bereza Kartuska (today [[Biaroza]]),{{r|PWN}} where some prisoners were brutally mistreated.{{r|Śleszyński03}} After the ''[[Non-partisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government|BBWR]]''{{'}}s 1930 victory, Piłsudski left most internal matters in the hands of [[Piłsudski's colonels|his "colonels"]] while he concentrated on military and foreign affairs.{{r|PWN}} He came under considerable criticism for his treatment of political opponents and their 1930 arrest and imprisonment was internationally condemned and damaged Poland's reputation.{{r|Biskupski2000}}
[[File:Aleksandra Piłsudska.JPG|thumb|left|The Marshal and his second wife, [[Aleksandra Piłsudska]], in later life]]
Piłsudski became increasingly disillusioned with democracy in Poland.{{r|CohenY89_65}} His intemperate public utterances (he called the ''[[Sejm]]'' a "prostitute") and his sending of 90 armed officers into the ''Sejm'' building in response to an impending [[vote of no-confidence]] caused concern in contemporary and modern observers who have seen his actions as setting precedents for authoritarian responses to political challenges.{{r|Times7Apr1930|Times11Nov1929|NYT12091993_Perlez}}

One of his main goals was to transform the [[parliamentary system]] into a [[presidential system]]; however, he opposed the introduction of [[totalitarianism]].{{r|PWN}} The adoption of a new Polish constitution in April 1935 that was tailored by Piłsudski's supporters to his specifications, providing for a strong presidency, came too late for Piłsudski to seek that office; but the [[April Constitution]] would serve Poland up to the outbreak of World War II and would carry its [[Polish Government in Exile|Government in Exile]] until the end of the war and beyond.

Nonetheless, Piłsudski's government depended more on his [[charismatic authority]] than on [[rational-legal authority]].{{r|PWN}} None of his followers could claim to be his legitimate heir, and after his death, the [[Sanacja|Sanation]] structure would quickly fracture, returning Poland to the pre-Piłsudski era of parliamentary political contention.{{r|PWN}}
[[File:Józef Piłsudski homaging at John III Sobieski tomb, commemorating 250 anniversary of battle of Vienna.PNG|thumb|In 1933, Piłsudski paid homage at the tomb of [[John III Sobieski]] in commemoration of the 250th anniversary of [[Battle of Vienna]].]]
Piłsudski's regime began a period of national stabilization and of improvement in the situation of [[ethnic minorities]], which formed about a third of the Second Republic's population.{{r|Stachura04_79|ColuEncyclPoland}} Piłsudski replaced the [[National Democracy|National Democrats]]' "[[polonization|ethnic-assimilation]]" with a "state-assimilation" policy: citizens were judged not by their ethnicity but by their loyalty to the state.{{r|Snyder04_144|Zimm04_166}} Widely recognized for his opposition to the National Democrats' anti-Semitic policies,{{r|Vital99_788|Payne95_141|Lieven94_163|Engelking01_75|Flannery05_200|Zimm03_19}} he extended his policy of "state-assimilation" to [[Polish Jews]].{{r|Snyder04_144|Zimm04_166|Prizel98_61|Wein90_292}} The years 1926 to 1935 and Piłsudski himself were favorably viewed by many [[Polish Jews]] whose situation improved especially under Piłsudski-appointed Prime Minister [[Kazimierz Bartel]].{{r|Cieplinski02|Paulsson03_37}} Many Jews saw Piłsudski as their only hope for restraining antisemitic currents in Poland and for maintaining public order; he was seen as a guarantor of stability and a friend of the Jewish people, who voted for him and actively participated in his political bloc.{{r|Snyder07_66}} Piłsudski's death in 1935 brought a deterioration in the quality of life of Poland's Jews.{{r|Zimm03_19}}

During the 1930s, a combination of developments, from the [[Great Depression]]{{r|Snyder04_144}} to the [[vicious spiral]] of ''[[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]'' terrorist attacks and government pacifications, caused government relations with the national minorities to deteriorate.{{r|Snyder04_144}}{{sfn|Davies|2005|loc=p. 407 (1982 ed. Columbia Univ. Press - ISBN 978-0-231-05352-5 }} Unrest among national minorities was also related to foreign policy. Troubles followed repressions in the largely-Ukrainian eastern Galicia, where nearly 1,800 persons were arrested. Tension also arose between the government and Poland's German minority, particularly in [[Upper Silesia]]. The government did not yield to calls for antisemitic measures; but the Jews (8.6% of Poland's population) grew discontented for economic reasons that were connected with the Depression. Overall, by the end of Piłsudski's life, his government's relations with national minorities were increasingly problematic.{{sfn|Leslie|1983|p=182}}

In the military sphere, Piłsudski, who had shown himself an accomplished military strategist in engineering the "[[Miracle at the Vistula]]", has been criticized by some for subsequently concentrating on personnel management and allegedly neglecting modernization of military strategy and equipment.{{r|PWN|Garlicki195_178}} His experiences in the Polish-Soviet War (1919–1921) may have led him to overestimate the importance of cavalry and to neglect the development of armoured and air forces.{{r|Garlicki195_178}} Others, however, contend that, particularly from the late 1920s, he had supported the development of these military branches.{{r|Urbank97_2_330-7}} The limitations on Poland's military modernization in this period may have been less doctrinal than financial.

===Foreign policy===
[[File:Kossak Józef Piłsudski.jpg|thumb|upright|Marshal Piłsudski, painted by [[Wojciech Kossak]], 1928]]
Under Piłsudski, Poland maintained good relations with neighboring [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], Hungary and [[Latvia]]. Relations were strained with [[Czechoslovakia]], however, and even worse with [[Lithuania]].{{sfn|Goldstein|2002|p=29}} Relations with [[Weimar Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] varied over time, but during Piłsudski's tenure could, for the most part, be described as neutral.{{r|Urbank97_538-40|Prizel98_71}}

Piłsudski's Promethean programme to weaken the Russian Empire and its [[successor state]], the Soviet Union, by supporting nationalist independence movements of major non-Russian peoples dwelling in Russia and the Soviet Union, was co-ordinated from 1927 to the 1939 outbreak of World War II in Europe by the [[military intelligence]] officer, [[Edmund Charaszkiewicz]]. In the [[interbellum]], but it yielded few tangible results.{{sfn|Charaszkiewicz|2000|pp=56-87}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B0527-0001-293, Warschau, Empfang Goebbels bei Marschall Pilsudski.jpg|thumb|left|270px|German ambassador, [[Hans-Adolf von Moltke]], Piłsudski, [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Józef Beck]], Polish Foreign minister, in [[Warsaw]] on 15 June 1934, five months after the [[German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact]]]]
Piłsudski sought to maintain his country's independence in the international arena. Assisted by his protégé, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs|Foreign Minister]] [[Józef Beck]], he sought support for Poland in alliances with western powers, such as France and the United Kingdom, and with friendly, if less powerful, neighbours, such as Romania and Hungary.{{r|Urbank97_539–40}}

A supporter of the Franco-Polish Military Alliance and the [[Polish-Romanian Alliance]], part of the [[Little Entente]], Piłsudski was disappointed by the French and British policy of [[appeasement]] evident in their signing of the [[Locarno Treaties]].{{r|Prizel98_71|Lukacs01_30|Jordan02_23}} Piłsudski, therefore, aimed also to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union and Germany and so Poland signed [[non-aggression pact]]s with both of its powerful neighbours: the 1932 [[Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]] and the 1934 [[German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]].{{r|Urbank97_539–40}} Both were meant to strengthen Poland's position in the eyes of its allies and neighbours.{{r|PolandGov}}

Piłsudski himself was acutely aware of the shakiness of the pacts, and he commented: "Having these pacts, we are straddling two stools. This cannot last long. We have to know from which stool we will tumble first, and when that will be".{{r|Kipp93_95}} Critics of the two non-aggression pacts have accused Piłsudski of underestimating Hitler's aggressiveness,{{r|Hehn05_76}} of giving Germany time to rearm{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=237}}{{r|Davidson04_25}} and of allowing Stalin to eliminate opposition, primarily in Ukraine, which had been supported by Piłsudski's [[Prometheism|Promethean]] program.{{sfn|Charaszkiewicz|2000|p=64}}

After [[Adolf Hitler]] [[Machtergreifung|came to power]] in Germany in January 1933, Piłsudski is rumored to have proposed to France a [[preventive war]] against Germany. It has been argued that Piłsudski may have been sounding out France regarding possible joint military action against Germany.{{r|Urbank97_2_317-26}} Lack of French interest may have been a reason for Poland signing the [[German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact|Non-Aggression Pact of January 1934]].{{r|Urbank97_539–40}}&lt;ref name="TT_NGP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GQH"/&gt;{{r|EBritannica_JP}} Little evidence has, however, been found in French or Polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal for preventive war was ever actually advanced.&lt;ref name="Bel"/&gt;

Hitler repeatedly suggested a German-Polish alliance against the Soviet Union, but Piłsudski declined, instead seeking precious time to prepare for potential war with either Germany or the Soviet Union.{{r|EBritannica_JP}}&lt;ref name="Hildebrand"/&gt; Just before his death, Piłsudski told [[Józef Beck]] that it must be Poland's policy to maintain neutral relations with Germany, keep up the Polish alliance with France and improve relations with the United Kingdom.{{r|Urbank97_539–40}}

==Religious views==
Piłsudski's religious views are a matter of debate. He was baptised on 15 December 1867 in the church of Powiewiórka (then [[Švenčionys|Sventsiany]] deanery) by the priest, Thomas Valinsky. His godparents were Joseph and Constance Martsinkovsky Ragalskaya.&lt;ref&gt;[Adam Borkiewicz: Źródła do biografii Józefa Piłsudskiego the z lat 1867-1892, Niepodległość. T. XIX. Warszawa: 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt;

He periodically changed his religious affiliation from [[Roman Catholicism]] to [[Lutheranism]], and back.

On 15 July 1899, at the village of Paproć Duża, near [[Łomża]], he married [[Maria Piłsudska]], a divorcée.  As the [[Catholic Church]] did not recognise divorces, she and Piłsudski had converted to [[Protestantism]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrzej Garlicki, ''Józef Piłsudski: 1867–1935'', [[Warsaw]], [[Czytelnik]], 1988,  {{ISBN|8307017157}}, pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In connection with marrying, Piłsudski had converted to the Evangelical-Augsburg Church.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilsudski later returned to the Catholic Church in order to marry [[Aleksandra Piłsudska]]. Piłsudski and Aleksandra could not get married as Piłsudski's wife Maria refused to divorce him. It was only after Maria's death in 1921 that they were married, on 25 October of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Adviser Daria and Thomas, ''Jozef Pilsudski: Legends and Facts'', Warsaw 1987, {{ISBN|83-203-1967-6}}, p. 132.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suleja Vladimir, ''Jozef Pilsudski'', Wroclaw - Warsaw - Kraków 2005, {{ISBN|83-04-04706-3}}, pp. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[May Coup (Poland)|May coup]], Piłsudski considered himself a Roman Catholic, but he did not appear to be religious and often used religion as a public tool. Piłsudski was quoted saying:
{{cquote|Religion is for brainless people.}} 
After the coup and Piłsudski's reign as dictator, he often clashed with Catholic leaders but nevertheless enjoyed a good working relationship with Cardinal [[Aleksander Kakowski]], who subsequently led his funeral mass. In 1937, Archbishop of Kraków, [[Adam Stefan Sapieha]], ordered to move Piłsudski's coffin from [[St. Leonard's Crypt]] to Royal Tombs at [[Wawel]]. This led to open conflict with the church and the government, which threatened to step down.

==Death==
[[File:Rossa-MATKA I SERCE SYNA.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Piłsudski's mother in [[Vilnius]], Lithuania. The huge black tombstone is inscribed: "''Matka i serce syna''"&lt;br/&gt; ("A mother and the heart of [her] son") and bears evocative lines from a poem by [[Juliusz Słowacki|Słowacki]].]]
By 1935, unbeknownst to the public, Piłsudski had for several years been in declining health. On 12 May 1935, he died of [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] at Warsaw's [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]]. The celebration of his life began spontaneously within half an hour of the announcement of his death.{{sfn|Drozdowski|Szwankowska|1995|p=5}} It was led by military personnel — former [[Polish Legions in World War I|Legionnaires]], members of the [[Polish Military Organization]], veterans of the wars of 1919–21 — and by his political collaborators from his service as Chief of State and, later, Prime Minister and Inspector-General.{{r|DroSzwa95_911}}

The [[Communist Party of Poland|Polish Communist Party]] immediately attacked Piłsudski as a fascist and capitalist,{{r|DroSzwa95_911}} though fascists themselves did not see him as one of them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SwMOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=%22a+liberal+democrat+in+the+clothes+of+an+old-world+knight.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wwxy3WRgEl&amp;sig=Ok3awKVR6URUy-YX_7C3M14ENXw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PvVrTPeCM4GsOJTuqZ0B&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20liberal%20democrat%20in%20the%20clothes%20of%20an%20old-world%20knight.%22&amp;f=false ''Ideas into Politics: Aspects of European History, 1880–1950''] R. J. Bullen, Hartmut Pogge von Strandmann, A. B. Polonsky, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1984, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Other opponents of the [[sanacja|Sanation]] regime, however, were more civil; socialists (such as [[Ignacy Daszyński]] and [[Tomasz Arciszewski]]) and [[Polish Christian Democratic Party|Christian Democrats]] (represented by Ignacy Paderewski, [[Stanisław Wojciechowski]] and [[Władysław Grabski]]) expressed condolences. The peasant parties split in their reactions ([[Wincenty Witos]] voicing criticism of Piłsudski, but [[Maciej Rataj]] and [[Stanisław Thugutt]] being supportive), while [[Roman Dmowski]]'s [[National Democracy|National Democrats]] expressed a toned-down criticism.{{r|DroSzwa95_911}}

Condolences were expressed by the clergy, including [[primate of Poland|Poland's Primate]] [[August Hlond]], as well as by [[Pope Pius XI]], who called himself a "personal friend" of Piłsudski. Notable appreciation for Piłsudski was expressed by Poland's ethnic and religious minorities. [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Greek Orthodox]], Protestant, [[Judaism|Judaic]] and Islamic organizations expressed condolences, praising Piłsudski for his policies of religious tolerance.{{r|DroSzwa95_911}} His death was a shock to members of the Jewish minority, who even years after remembered him as a "very good man" who "protected Jews".&lt;ref name="Dov Weissberg, I remember, page 116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview with Holocaust survivor Cyla Wiener"/&gt;

Mainstream organizations of ethnic minorities similarly expressed their support for his policies of ethnic tolerance, though he was criticized by, in addition to the Polish communists, the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|Jewish Labour Bund]], and Ukrainian, German and Lithuanian extremists.{{r|DroSzwa95_911}}

On the international scene, Pope Pius XI held a special ceremony 18 May in the [[Holy See]], a commemoration was conducted at [[League of Nations]] [[Geneva]] headquarters, and dozens of messages of condolence arrived in Poland from [[head of state|heads of state]] across the world, including Germany's Adolf Hitler, the Soviet Union's [[Joseph Stalin]], Italy's [[Benito Mussolini]] and King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]], France's [[Albert Lebrun]] and [[Pierre-Étienne Flandin]], Austria's [[Wilhelm Miklas]], Japan's Emperor [[Hirohito]], and Britain's King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]].{{r|DroSzwa95_911}}

Ceremonies, [[mass (liturgy)|masses]] and an enormous funeral were held; a [[funeral train]] toured Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHumphrey1936|Humphrey 1936]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=BNkwAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Pi%C5%82sudski+%22funeral+train%22&amp;dq=Pi%C5%82sudski+%22funeral+train%22&amp;hl=pl&amp;pgis=1 p. 295].&lt;/ref&gt; A series of postcards, stamps and postmarks was also released. In 1937, after a two-year display at [[St. Leonard's Crypt]] in [[Kraków]]'s [[Wawel Cathedral]], Piłsudski's body was laid to rest in the Cathedral's Crypt under the Silver Bells, except for his brain, which he had willed for study to [[Vilnius University|Stefan Batory University]], and his heart, which was interred in his mother's grave at [[Vilnius]]' [[Rasos Cemetery]], where it remains.{{r|PolandGov}}{{sfn|Watt|1979|p=338}}

The 1937 relocation of his remains, made by his long-standing adversary [[Adam Stefan Sapieha|Adam Sapieha]], then [[Archbishop of Krakow]], incited widespread protests that included calls for Sapieha's removal.&lt;ref name="Crowds urge Poland to banish Archbishop; Pilsudski Legionnaires also Assail Catholic Church on the Removal of Marshal's Body"/&gt;{{sfn|Lerski|1996|loc=[https://books.google.com/?id=QTUTqE2difgC&amp;pg=PA525 p. 525]}}

==Legacy==
{{rquote|right|I am not going to dictate to you what you write about my life and work. I only ask that you not make me out to be a 'whiner and sentimentalist.'|author=Piłsudski, 1908{{r|Urbank97_133–41}}}}

On 13 May 1935, in accordance with Piłsudski's last wishes, [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]] was named by Poland's president and government to be [[Inspector-General]] of the [[Polish Armed Forces]], and on 10 November 1936, he was elevated to [[Marshal of Poland]].{{sfn|Jabłonowski|Stawecki|1998|p=13}} Rydz was now one of the most powerful people in Poland, the "second man in the state after the President".{{sfn|Jabłonowski|Stawecki|1998|p=5}} While many saw Rydz-Śmigły as a successor to Piłsudski, he never became as influential.{{r|JabStaw98_14}}

As the Polish government became increasingly [[authoritarian]] and conservative, the Rydz-Śmigły faction was opposed by that of the more moderate [[Ignacy Mościcki]], who remained President.{{r|JabStaw98_14}} After 1938 Rydz-Śmigły reconciled with the President, but the ruling group remained divided into the "President's Men", mostly civilians (the "Castle Group", after the President's official residence, Warsaw's [[Royal Castle (Warsaw)|Royal Castle]]), and the "Marshal's Men" ("[[Piłsudski's colonels|Piłsudski's Colonels]]"), professional military officers and old comrades-in-arms of Piłsudski's. After the German [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, some of this political division would survive within the [[Polish government in exile]].

[[File:Piłsudski statue and honour guards.jpg|thumb|right|[[Józef Piłsudski Monument in Warsaw (Piłsudski Square)|Statue of Piłsudski]] on Warsaw's [[Piłsudski Square]]—one of many [[statuary]] tributes throughout Poland]]
Piłsudski had given Poland something akin to what [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]'s [[Onufry Zagłoba]] had mused about: a Polish [[Oliver Cromwell]]. As such, the Marshal had inevitably drawn both intense loyalty and intense vilification.&lt;ref name="TT_NGP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldfarb"/&gt;{{sfn|Drozdowski|Szwankowska|1995|p=6}}

In 1935, at Piłsudski's funeral, President Mościcki [[eulogy|eulogized]] the Marshal: "He was the king of our hearts and the sovereign of our will. During a half-century of his life's travails, he captured heart after heart, soul after soul, until he had drawn the whole of Poland within the purple of his royal spirit&amp;nbsp;... He gave Poland freedom, boundaries, power and respect."&lt;ref name="Mość"&gt;Translation of Mościcki's speech from 1935.

After World War II, little of Piłsudski's thought influenced the policies of the [[Polish People's Republic]], a ''de facto'' [[satellite state|satellite]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. In particular, Poland was in no position to resume Piłsudski's effort to build an ''Intermarium'' federation of Poland and some of its neighbors; and a "[[Prometheism|Promethean]]" endeavor to "break up the Russian state into its main constituents and emancipate the countries that have been forcibly incorporated into that empire."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|Charaszkiewicz|2000|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a decade after World War II, Piłsudski was either ignored or condemned by Poland's communist government, along with the entire interwar [[Second Polish Republic]]. This began to change, however, particularly after [[de-Stalinization]] and the [[Polish October]] (1956), and historiography in Poland gradually moved away from a purely negative view of Piłsudski toward a more balanced and neutral assessment.{{r|Władyka+Żuławnik}}

After the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] and the 1991 disintegration of the [[Soviet Union]], Piłsudski once again came to be publicly acknowledged as a Polish national hero.&lt;ref name="Roshwald"/&gt; On the sixtieth anniversary of his death, on 12 May 1995, Poland's ''[[Sejm]]'' adopted a resolution: "Józef Piłsudski will remain, in our nation's memory, the founder of its independence and the victorious leader who fended off a foreign assault that threatened the whole of Europe and its civilization. Józef Piłsudski served his country well and has entered our history forever."&lt;ref name="Sejm1995"/&gt;

While some of Piłsudski's political moves remain controversial—particularly the May 1926 Coup d'état, the [[Brest trial]]s (1931–32), the 1934 establishment of the [[Bereza Kartuska detention camp]], and successive Polish governments' failure to formulate consistent, constructive policies toward the [[national minorities]]{{sfn|Charaszkiewicz|2000|pp=66–67}}—Piłsudski continues to be viewed by most Poles as a providential figure in the country's 20th-century history.

[[File:Pilsudski carricature by Szwajcer.PNG|thumb|upright|Contemporary [[caricature]] of Józef Piłsudski by [[Jerzy Szwajcer]]]]
Piłsudski has lent his name to several military units, including the [[Polish 1st Legions Infantry Division|1st Legions Infantry Division]] and [[armored train]] No. 51 ("''I Marszałek''"—"the First Marshal").&lt;ref name="PIBWL"/&gt;

Also named for Piłsudski have been [[Piłsudski's Mound]], one of four man-made [[mound]]s in [[Kraków]];&lt;ref name="mound"/&gt; the [[Józef Piłsudski Institute of America]], a New York City research center and museum on the modern [[history of Poland]];&lt;ref name="Institute"/&gt; the [[Józef Piłsudski University of Physical Education in Warsaw]];&lt;ref name="MON"/&gt; a passenger ship, {{MS|Piłsudski}}; a gunboat, {{ORP|Komendant Piłsudski}}; and a racehorse, ''[[Pilsudski (horse)|Pilsudski]]''. Virtually every Polish city has its "Piłsudski Street". (There are, by contrast, few if any streets named after Piłsudski's [[National Democracy|National-Democrat]] arch-rival, [[Roman Dmowski]], even in Dmowski's old [[Greater Poland|Greater-Poland]] political stronghold). There are statues of Piłsudski in many Polish cities; the highest density of such [[statuary]] memorials is found in Warsaw, which has three in little more than a mile between the [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]], Piłsudski's residence, and [[Piłsudski Square]].

He was the subject of paintings by renowned artists such as [[Jacek Malczewski]] (1916) and [[Wojciech Kossak]] (leaning on his sword, 1928; and astride his horse, ''[[Kasztanka]]'', 1928), as well as of numerous caricatures and photos.

Piłsudski has been a character in numerous works of fiction, such as the 1922 novel ''Generał Barcz'' (General Barcz) by [[Juliusz Kaden-Bandrowski]] and the 2007 novel ''[[Ice (Dukaj novel)|Ice]]'' (''Lód'') by [[Jacek Dukaj]].

Both daughters of Marshal Piłsudski returned to Poland in 1990, after the fall of the Communist system. Jadwiga Piłsudska's daughter Joanna Jaraczewska returned to Poland in 1979. She married a Polish [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|"Solidarity"]] activist [[Janusz Onyszkiewicz]] in a political prison in 1983.

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} Józef Klemens Piłsudski was commonly referred to without his middle name, as "Józef Piłsudski". A few English sources translate his first name as "Joseph", but this is not the common practice. As a young man, he belonged to underground organizations and used various pseudonyms, including "''Wiktor''", "''Mieczysław''" and "''Ziuk''" (the latter also being his family nickname). Later he was often affectionately called "''Dziadek''" ("Grandpa" or "the Old Man") and "''Marszałek''" ("the Marshal"). His ex-soldiers from the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Legions]] also referred to him as "''Komendant''" ("the Commandant").

'''b.''' {{Note label|b|b|none}}Piłsudski sometimes spoke of being a Lithuanian of Polish culture.{{sfn|Davies|1986|p=139}} For several centuries, declaring both Lithuanian and Polish identity was not self-excluding alike in case of master of Polish poetry [[Adam Mickiewicz]]. The question of Piłsudski's ethnicity and culture simply does not match contemporary templates, the more the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] which Piłsudski regarded as his spiritual ''patria'' failed to reborn itself and finally ceased to exist in the wake of arising modern nationalisms. [[Timothy Snyder]], who calls him a "Polish-Lithuanian", notes that Piłsudski did not think in terms of 20th-century nationalisms and [[ethnicity|ethnicities]]; he considered himself ''both'' a Pole and a Lithuanian, and his homeland was the historic [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].{{sfn|Snyder|2004|p=70}}

In [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] and [[Roman law]], the '''legitime''' (''legitima portio''), also known as a [[forced_heirship|forced share]] or legal right share, of a decedent's [[estate (law)|estate]] is that portion of the estate from which he cannot disinherit his children, or his parents, without sufficient legal cause. The word comes from [[French language|French]] ''héritier légitime'', meaning "rightful heir."

The legitime is usually a [[statute|statutory]] fraction of the decedent's gross estate and passes as joint property to the decedent's [[next-of-kin]] in equal undivided shares. The legitime cannot be infringed in order to give a spouse or other beneficiary a greater share of the estate. Therefore, when a decedent has children and leaves a [[will_(law)|will]], it is unlawful for the [[testator]] to override the legitime by special gift which exhausts the estate or by designating his spouse or other person as sole beneficiary. This is known as ''preterition'' when arising by omission and ''disinheritance'' when heirs are expressly deprived.

==English Common law==
In English [[common law]], there is no legitime; the [[Statute of Wills]], 32 [[Henry VIII of England|Hen. VIII]] c. 1, provided for the unfettered distribution of a decedent's entire estate; a [[testator]] is entitled to disinherit any and all of his children, for any reason and for no reason.  Most jurisdictions in the [[United States]] have enacted statutes that prohibit a testator from disinheriting a spouse, or provided that in the event of such a will the spouse may [[elective share|elect to "take against the will"]] and claim a statutory share of a decedent's estate.  This is done as a substitute for the common law rights of [[dower]] and [[curtesy]].

== In certain jurisdictions ==

=== Brazil ===

In [[Brazil]], the descendants (alternatively, the parents or grandparents) and the spouse must receive at least 50% of it among themselves.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Czech Republic ===

In the [[Czech Republic]], the nearest descendants can require 1/4 of their intestacy portion if they are of age or 3/4 of their intestacy portion if they are under age. (If a child of the deceased died before him, his children can claim forced share instead of him etc.)

=== Louisiana ===

In [[Louisiana]], until the passing of Act No. 788 of 1989, the situation was different. Formerly, in Louisiana the legitime operated to prevent a parent from wholly disinheriting his children, who were and are still called [[forced heirship|forced heirs]].  If the decedent left issue in the form of one child, that issue must receive at least 25% of the decedent's estate.  If there were two or more children, they must receive at least 50% of it among themselves.  Similar provisions prevented a decedent with living parents from disinheriting them.

Post-1989 [[Louisiana law]] provides for a forced share only if the decedent's children are under 24 years of age, or are permanently unable to take care of themselves, referred to as interdicted or subject to interdiction. Otherwise, a decedent's issue may be wholly disinherited. This change is essentially the importation of the common law doctrine of freedom of testation, but stops short of fully abolishing forced heirship because that is expressly forbidden by [[Louisiana Constitution]] Article XII, Section 5.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Shaw Spaht, Kathryn Venturatos Lorio, Cynthia Picou, Cynthia Samuel, and Frederick W. Swaim Jr., “The New Forced Heirship Legislation: A Regrettable ‘Revolution’”, in: ''Louisiana Law Review'' 50-3 (January 1990): 409-99. [http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5224&amp;context=lalrev].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scotland ===

In [[Scotland]], ''legitim'' is the right of the issue (including adult issue) to not less than a defined share of the value of the moveable estate of the deceased. The share is one half, if the deceased left no relict (widow or widower), or one third if there was a relict. For example, if a testator has two children, and no spouse, and in her/his testament leaves everything to one of them, the other would be entitled to half of the legitim fund, which means a half of a half of the total net value of the moveable estate. (Or half of a third if there were a spouse.)  Legitim is also called the '''bairn’s pairt''' or '''part of gear''' ([[Scots language|Scots]] ''bairn'' ‘child’).&lt;ref&gt;D. R. Macdonald, ''Succession'', 3rd edn (2001); Hilary Hiram, ''The Scots Law of Succession'', 2nd edn (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philippines ===

Under the [[Civil Code of the Philippines]], the legitime is given to and/or shared by the compulsory heirs of the decedent. This is also called ''compulsory succession'' because the law has reserved it for the compulsory heirs and thus, the testator has no power to give it away to anyone of his liking. The compulsory heirs include the children, or descendants (this class includes the adopted children and legitimated children), legitimate or illegitimate; in their default, the legitimate parents, or legitimate ascendants; the surviving spouse, which concurs with the foregoing classes; and the illegitimate parents.

Thus, legitimate children always get one half of the estate, divided equally between them. The surviving spouse gets a share equal to that of a legitimate child, except when there is only one legitimate child, in which case he or she gets one fourth of the estate. Illegitimate children get one half of the share given to legitimate children.

The legitimate parents or ascendants are excluded by legitimate children or descendants, but not by illegitimate children, and get one half of the estate in such cases. The surviving spouse or illegitimate children, when either concur with the parents or ascendants, get one fourth of the estate. If all concur, the share of the surviving spouse is reduced to one eighth of the estate.

The surviving spouse gets one half of the estate when there are no other heirs, and in certain cases, when the marriage is ''in articulo mortis'', he or she gets one third. The surviving spouse also gets one third of the estate when concurring with illegitimate children, who also get the same share. However, the surviving spouse gets one fourth when concurring with illegitimate parents, who also get one fourth of the estate.

The illegitimate children, in default of everyone, gets one half of the estate. The illegitimate parents, who are excluded by everyone except the surviving spouse, also get one half in default of everyone.

This section of the [[list of rampage killers]] contains those cases that occurred in [[Europe]].

This section does '''not''' include [[List of rampage killers#School massacres|school massacres]]; [[List of rampage killers#Workplace killings|workplace killings]]; [[List of rampage killers#Religious, political or racial crimes|religious, political, or racial crimes]]; or mass murders that took place primarily in a [[List of rampage killers#Domestic violence|domestic environment]], like familicides, which are covered in their own categories. Cases where the primary motive for the murders was to facilitate or cover up another [[felony]], like robbery, are also excluded.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) [https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461455257 School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention]; Springer, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.

All abbreviations used in the table are explained [[#Abbreviations and footnotes|below]].

'''Mark Bell''' was a British DJ and record producer of [[house music]] who, as well as being a member of the pioneering electronic music group [[LFO (British band)|LFO]]&lt;ref name="HawkinsScott2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawkins|first1=Stan|last2=Scott|first2=Derek B.|title=Critical Musicological Reflections: Essays in Honour of Derek B. Scott|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3UrMpU2v8u8C&amp;pg=PA99|accessdate=5 September 2014|year=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=9781409425618|pages=99–}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Warp Records]], collaborated with a wide range of artists such as [[Björk]] and [[Depeche Mode]], for whom he took on the production duties for the entire ''[[Exciter (album)|Exciter]]'' album.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Mark Bell's early musical influences came from three specific sources.&lt;ref name="warp-bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warp.net/news/2003-biography-by-bill-brewster/|publisher=[[Warp (record label)|Warp]]|title=LFO|first=Bill|last=Brewster|date=16 December 2008|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One was an art teacher in school who taught art and played music by [[Jean-Michel Jarre]] and [[Kraftwerk]], an older sister who played [[disco music|disco]], [[funk music]] and [[Electro (music)|electro]] from her bedroom, and a music shop in [[Leeds]] Mark described as having "arcade games like ''[[Tempest (video game)|Tempest]]'' and ''[[Defender (video game)|Defender]]''" and that it would play "loads of early hip hop like [[Schoolly D]]. I remember feeling this is mine and my friend’s place".&lt;ref name="warp-bio" /&gt; Bell first experiments in electronic music involved him making a deal with his girlfriend's father who made his musical ballads listened to despite disliking them.&lt;ref name="warp-bio" /&gt; Bell convinced him he required a real backing band and purchased his drum machine from him.&lt;ref name="warp-bio" /&gt;

Bell went to college to study photography and graphic design, where he met the West Yorkshire DJ Martin Williams and [[Gez Varley]].&lt;ref name="warp-bio" /&gt; With money from Varley's grandmother, Bell had access to a bedroom full of equipment.&lt;ref name="warp-bio" /&gt; In 1988, Varley, Bell and Martin began to play gigs as [[LFO (British band)|LFO]], named after the [[Low-frequency oscillation|low frequency oscillator]], a function of many synthesizers.&lt;ref name="warp-bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rs-death"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bjork-depeche-mode-producer-mark-bell-dead-20141013|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|title=Bjork, Depeche Mode Producer Mark Bell Dead|accessdate=8 February 2018|last=Kreps|first=Daneil|date=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LFO===
LFO were performing at the Warehouse, a club in [[Leeds]], when Steve Beckett and Rob Mitchell arrived and noticed the positive reception club goers had to the track "LFO".&lt;ref name="warp-bio" /&gt; Beckett and Mitchell were the original creators of the [[Warp (record label)|Warp]] record label, but had not officially created the label yet.&lt;ref name="warp-bio" /&gt; Despite this, Beckett and Mitchell offered to put out a 12-inch single,&lt;ref name="warp-bio" /&gt; which was expected to sell about 2,000 copies but eventually became a Top 20 hit.&lt;ref name="rs-death" /&gt; The label released their first studio album ''[[Frequencies (album)|Frequencies]]'' in 1991.&lt;ref name="warp-bio" /&gt; Following the album's release, Bell continued to release singles for other independent labels such as [[Carl Craig]]'s [[Planet E]].&lt;ref name="warp-bio" /&gt; 
[[File:Björk at Cannes.jpg|thumb|Mark Bell would perform production duties on all of Björk's albums between ''Homogenic'' and ''Biophilia''.]]
While working on a follow-up album, Bell began his partnership with [[Björk]] before the release of her album ''[[Post (Björk album)|Post]]''.{{sfn|Pytlik|2003|p=181}} Bell gave her a cassette of LFO demo material allowing her to use what she wanted for a future release.{{sfn|Pytlik|2003|p=181}} Björk chose a track that would later become her song "I Go Humble", which would show up again in instrumental form as "Shove Piggy Shove" on the LFO album ''[[Advance (album)|Advance]]'' in 1996.&lt;ref name="warp-bio" /&gt;{{sfn|Pytlik|2003|p=181}} When asked about the long gap between records, Bell stated “It’s not intentional...It's easy doing your first album as you have all the first part of your life to express. The second one is harder unless you're going to repeat yourself... and repetition bores me a bit, it's a complete wasted opportunity to be creative."&lt;ref name="warp-bio" /&gt; After the release of ''Advance'', Bell and Varley parted ways, with Bell retaining rights to the name LFO.&lt;ref name="warp-bio" /&gt; Bell continued to perform under the LFO moniker.&lt;ref name="warp-bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rs-death" /&gt;

===Production work and final LFO album===

Björk had initially wanted Bell to contribute to her albums ''Debut'' and ''Post'' and started a real collaboration with her on the album ''[[Homogenic]]''.&lt;ref name="rs-death" /&gt;&lt;ref name=milkfactory&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Bell / LFO Interview |work=The Milk Factory |url=http://www.themilkfactory.co.uk/interviews/lfoiw.htm |accessdate=2009-07-05 |date=June 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015020932/http://www.themilkfactory.co.uk/interviews/lfoiw.htm |archivedate=2009-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell was credited for the majority of the album's production, including the songs "[[Pluto (song)|Pluto]]", "[[Alarm Call]]", and the bassline in "[[Jóga]]".{{sfn|Pytlik|2003|p=124}} Björk stated that she "trusts and respects what [Bell] does for me. If I were to say who has influenced me most it would be [[Stockhausen]], Kraftwerk, [[Brian Eno]] and Mark Bell".{{sfn|Pytlik|2003|p=124}}

Bell would also produce Björk's ''[[Selmasongs]]'', the soundtrack to the [[Lars von Trier]]'s film ''[[Dancer in the Dark]]''.&lt;ref name="warp-bio" /&gt; Outside Björk, Bell produced [[Depeche Mode]]'s ''[[Exciter (album)|Exciter]]''.&lt;ref name="warp-bio" /&gt; Bell commented on working the group was fun but strange, stating he had listened to the group when he was 12 and found the band asking him for days off or "what they should eat".&lt;ref name="warp-bio" /&gt;

===Later works and death===
Bell released one more LFO album, ''[[Sheath (album)|Sheath]]'' in 2003.&lt;ref name="warp-bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rs-death" /&gt; Other collaborations included contributing to [[Deltron 3030]]'s [[Deltron 3030 (album)|self-titled album]] and working on every Björk album until ''[[Biophilia (album)|Biophilia]]'' in 2011.&lt;ref name="rs-death" /&gt;

Bell died on 8 October 2014 at the age of 43. His death was reported on 13 October 2014 due to complications after surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Bell of LFO has passed away|url=http://www.mixmag.net/news/mark-bell-of-lfo-has-passed-away|website=Mixmag|accessdate=13 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222203035/http://www.mixmag.net/news/mark-bell-of-lfo-has-passed-away|archivedate=22 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RIP Mark Bell"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Glen|title=RIP Mark Bell|url=http://www.xlr8r.com/news/2014/10/rip-mark-bell|website=XLR8R|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://announce.jpress.co.uk/yorkshire-weekly-newspaper-group/obituary/mark-bell/39409975|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301095953/http://announce.jpress.co.uk/yorkshire-weekly-newspaper-group/obituary/mark-bell/39409975|archive-date=1 March 2017|accessdate=7 February 2018|title=Mark Bell : Obituary|work=Yorkshire Weekly Newspaper Group|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[developmental biology]] of the early twentieth century, a '''morphogenetic field''' is a group of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s able to respond to discrete, localized [[biochemical]] signals leading to the [[morphogenesis|development of specific morphological structures]] or [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s.&lt;ref name=MBOC&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P | title=Universal Mechanisms of Animal Development.

== Historical development ==
The concept of the morphogenetic field, fundamental in the early twentieth century to the study of embryological development, was first introduced in 1910 by [[Alexander Gurvich|Alexander G. Gurwitsch]].&lt;ref name="Beloussov_1997"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Life of Alexander G. Gurwitsch and his relevant contribution to the theory of morphogenetic fields | first=LV | last=Beloussov | journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology | volume=41 | issue=6 | year=1997 | pages=771&amp;ndash;779 | url=http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/contents.php?vol=41&amp;issue=6&amp;doi=9449452 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, with comment by SF Gilbert and JM Optiz.&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental support was provided by [[Ross Granville Harrison]]'s experiments transplanting fragments of a newt embryo into different locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/112/3/669.pdf | title=Gradient fields and homeobox genes | first1=EM | last1=de Robertis | first2=EA | last2=Morita | first3=KWY | last3=Cho | journal=Development | year=1991 | volume=112 | pages=669&amp;ndash;678 | pmid=1682124 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison was able to identify "fields" of cells producing organs such as limbs, tail and gills and to show that these fields could be fragmented or have undifferentiated cells added and a complete normal final structure would still result. It was thus considered that it was the "field" of cells, rather than individual cells, that were patterned for subsequent development of particular organs. The field concept was developed further by Harrison's friend [[Hans Spemann]], and then by [[Paul Alfred Weiss|Paul Weiss]] and others.&lt;ref name="Gilbert_1996"/&gt; The concept was similar to the meaning of the term [[entelechy]] of vitalists like [[Hans Adolf Eduard Driesch]] (1867-1941).

By the 1930s, however, the work of geneticists, especially [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], revealed the importance of chromosomes and genes for controlling development, and the rise of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|new synthesis]] in evolutionary biology lessened the perceived importance of the field hypothesis. Morgan was a particularly harsh critic of fields since the gene and the field were perceived as competitors for recognition as the basic unit of [[ontogeny]].&lt;ref name="Gilbert_1996"/&gt; With the discovery and mapping of master control genes, such as the [[homeobox]] genes the pre-eminence of genes seemed assured. But in the late twentieth century the field concept was "rediscovered" as a useful part of developmental biology. It was found, for example, that different mutations could cause the same malformations, suggesting that the mutations were affecting a complex of structures as a unit, a unit that might correspond to the field of early 20th century embryology.

Scott Gilbert proposed that the morphogenetic field is a middle ground between genes and evolution.&lt;ref name="Gilbert_1996"/&gt; That is, genes act upon fields, which then act upon the developing organism.&lt;ref name="Gilbert_1996"/&gt; Jessica Bolker described morphogenetic fields not merely as incipient structures or organs, but as dynamic entities with their own localized development processes, which are central to the emerging field of [[Evolutionary developmental biology]] ("evo-devo").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Modularity in Development and Why It Matters to Evo-Devo | first=JA | last=Bolker | journal=American Zoologist | volume=40| issue=5 | pages=770–776 | year=2000 | url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/40/5/770| doi=10.1668/0003-1569(2000)040[0770:MIDAWI]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Sean B. Carroll]] and colleagues mention morphogenetic fields only as a concept proposed by early embryologists to explain the finding that a forelimb bud could be transplanted and still give rise to a forelimb; they define "field" simply as "a discrete region" in an embryo.&lt;ref name="CGW"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carroll |first1=Sean B. |last2=Grenier |first2=Jennifer K. |last3=Weatherbee |first3=Scott D. |authorlink1=Sean B.

'''Brian Lee Draper''' (born 1990) and '''Torey Michael Adamcik''' (born June 14, 1990)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://triedasadults.org/torey.html |title= About Torey Adamcik |accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; are American men who were convicted in Idaho as juveniles of the first-degree '''murder of Cassie Jo Stoddart''' on September 22, 2006. Each aged 16 when they committed the crime against their high school classmate, they received mandatory sentences of life in prison without parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mydeathspace.com/article/2008/01/19/Brian_Draper_(17)_and_Torey_Adamcik_(17)_stabbed_Cassie_Jo_Stoddart_(16)_to_death |title=Brian Draper (17) and Torey Adamcik (17) stabbed Cassie Jo Stoddart (16) to death |accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Montgomery v. Louisiana]]'' (2016), the United States Supreme Court ruled that such a mandatory sentence for a crime committed as a juvenile was unconstitutional, even for a person who committed murder, as it did not allow for what is scientifically known about juvenile brains, nor for mitigating factors, and cut off the possibility of reform that might lead to freedom. It directed state courts to review sentences for all persons covered under this ruling, an estimated 1200 to 1800 nationwide.&lt;ref name="ussc"/&gt; Draper and Adamcik are among the inmates whose sentences will be reviewed by state courts under this ruling.

Because of their youth and the premeditation of their crime, the two young men have been studied during and since their convictions. They were covered in the 2013 documentary ''Lost for Life'', about persons convicted and imprisoned as juveniles who are serving mandatory life sentences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nancy-doyle-palmer-/lost-for-life-resolution-_b_3558941.html], ''Huffington Post''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idahostatejournal.com/members/relief-hearing-postponed-for-youth-convicted-of-murdering-cassie-jo/article_9d05a8cc-3667-11e4-99d3-001a4bcf887a.html|title=Relief hearing postponed for youth convicted of murdering Cassie Jo Stoddart|work=Idaho State Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/going-out-guide/wp/2014/08/22/watch-online-cuban-fury-lost-for-life-and-coherence/], ''Washington Post''&lt;/ref&gt; Their stories have been featured on [[BBC Three]]'s ''Teen Killers: Life without Parole'', originally shown on April 21, 2014. The pair of young men were also featured on Investigation Discovery's ''Your Worst Nightmare'', which premiered in October 2014. Adamcik was interviewed as a potential suspect in a separate murder as part of the ''Cold Justice'' episode, "Still of the Night", which aired in January 2015. They are featured in a documentary entitled ''CopyCat Killers'', shown on the Reelz channel. They are also featured on Investigation Discovery's ''Murder Among Friends,'' which premiered July 20, 2017 and ''Unmasked'' which premiered on October 15, 2018.

==Background==
Brian Draper spent most of his childhood living with his family in the state of Utah. He and his family moved to [[Pocatello, Idaho]]. He attended local schools and met Idaho native Torey Adamcik when they were both students at [[Pocatello High School]]. They were both interested in films and started recording their own.

'''Cassie Jo Stoddart''' (December 21, 1989 - September 22, 2006) also attended Pocatello High School; she and both boys were juniors. Cassie had an older sister and a younger brother.

==The murder==
On the night of September 22, 2006, Cassie was house sitting for Allison and Frank Contreras, her aunt and uncle who had moved from California with their children the year before.&lt;ref name="bryce"&gt;[http://idahostatejournal.com/members/house-where-murder-of-cassie-jo-stoddart-took-place-proving/article_57694590-5cdb-11e4-876d-270a4ac0f093.html Debbie Bryce, "House where murder of Cassie Jo Stoddart took place proving hard to sell"], ''Idaho State Journal'', October 2014; accessed 9 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; She was visited that evening by her boyfriend Matt. Later, Draper and Adamcik showed up. The four decided to watch a film together, until Draper and Adamcik said they would prefer to go to a film at a local [[movie theater]], leaving Cassie and Matt at the home. At one point when Cassie and Matt were alone, the electricity suddenly went out. It was restored before Matt was picked up by his mother.

Unbeknownst to Stoddart or Matt, Draper and Adamcik had returned to the house before Matt's departure (roughly 10:30 p.m). Having never gone to the theater, they were both lying in wait. They later confessed to purposely shutting the power off. They entered the house and stabbed Stoddart approximately 30 times; 12 wounds were potentially fatal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20IDCO%2020110913153 STATE v. DRAPER], Leagle&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the investigation of the murder, police found that Draper and Adamcik had recorded their plan to murder Stoddart in advance on video tape while they were at school.&lt;ref name=News8&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.localnews8.com/news/23327536/detail.html |title=Cassie Stoddart Documentary To Air Sunday Night |publisher= Local News 8 Pocatello Bureau |author=Genevieve Judge |date=2010-04-30 |accessdate=2011-07-27 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814194702/http://www.localnews8.com/news/23327536/detail.html |archive-date=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was shown at their trials.

==Arrest and interrogations==
Draper and Adamcik were arrested on September 27, 2006 and charged with [[first degree murder]] and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder.&lt;ref name=adults&gt;{{cite web |url=http://triedasadults.org/case.html |title=Torey's Story - Case History |accessdate=2011-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130416032636/http://triedasadults.org/case.html |archivedate=2013-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the interrogations, each teen blamed the other. Draper claimed he was in the same room with Adamcik when Stoddart was killed but denied stabbing her. He later admitted stabbing her allegedly under commands from Adamcik. He led the investigators to Black Rock Canyon where the youths had disposed of the clothing, masks, and knives they used for the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teenkillers.org/index.php/juvenile-lifers/offenders-cases-state/idaho-offenders/ |title=Idaho offenders.

==Trial and sentencing==
At the trial, the prosecution revealed that Draper had said he was inspired by [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], who committed the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. Later Adamcik was said to have been inspired by the ''[[Scream (franchise)|Scream]]'' horror film franchise. On April 17, 2007, Draper was found guilty. Adamcik's trial started on May 31, 2007; he was convicted on June 8, 2007. On August 21, 2007, based on being convicted of first-degree murder, each received a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility for parole, and 30 years-to-life for being convicted of conspiracy to commit murder.&lt;ref name=News8/&gt;
Adamcik and Draper are both serving their time at [[Idaho State Correctional Institution]]. It is located in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Ada County, Idaho]], near [[Kuna, Idaho|Kuna]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.idoc.idaho.gov/content/locations Locations]." [[Idaho Department of Correction]]. Retrieved on June 4, 2011. "Idaho State Correctional Institution (ISCI), 13500 S. Pleasant Valley Rd, Kuna, ID 83634"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeals==
Their attorneys filed separate appeals at the State Supreme Court in September 2010 for Adamcik&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.idahostatejournal.com/news/local/article_0524ce06-c82b-11df-b164-001cc4c03286.html |title=Supreme Court hears Adamcik appeal |publisher=Idaho State Journal |date=2010-09-24 |accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in April 2011 for Draper. Draper was seeking to have his conviction vacated or to be given a limited life sentence that would allow for his release on parole (if approved) after 30 years.&lt;ref name=adults/&gt;&lt;ref name=Journal&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.idahostatejournal.com/news/local/article_7dd7272a-6620-11e0-a3c4-001cc4c002e0.html |title=Convicted Idaho killer Brian Draper asks justices for new trial |publisher=Idaho State Journal |author=John Miller |date=2011-04-13 |accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isc.idaho.gov/ISC_PressRelease_04.13.11.pdf |title=IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF IDAHO. STATE OF IDAHO vs BRIAN L. DRAPER |accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first appeal for both Adamcik and Draper was denied in a 3/2 decision. The high court vacated Draper's conviction on conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, saying that jurors were given erroneous instructions on that charge, but they affirmed his conviction for first-degree murder and life sentence without parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700206022/Idaho-court-upholds-conviction-sentence-in-stabbing.html |title= Idaho court upholds conviction, sentence in stabbing |publisher=AP |date=2011-12-10 |accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015 Adamcik gained a hearing for post-conviction relief with state Sixth District Magistrate Judge Mitchell W. Brown. He claimed that testimony from character witnesses could have changed the outcome of the sentencing, but that his former attorney, against Adamcik's parents' wishes, chose not to call upon these witnesses. Adamcik said that his attorney believed that the prosecution would have submitted even more damaging evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.kpvi.com/news/local_news/day-one-of-adamcik-s-post-conviction-relief-hearing/article_95ef6978-08ec-5c23-8e2f-231810e1cf27.html |title=Day One of Adamcik's Post-Conviction Relief Hearing |publisher=KPVI News 6 |date=2015-07-22 |accessdate=2018-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016 Judge Brown denied his request for post-conviction relief.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;[http://idahostatejournal.com/members/remembering-cassie-jo-brother-opens-up-on-th-anniversary-of/article_b160f34d-1f1e-5a9c-a585-bc49422a78b7.html Shelbie Harris, "Remembering Cassie Jo — Brother opens up on 10th anniversary of grisly murder"], ''Idaho State Journal'', 25 Sep 2016; accessed 9 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Adamcik appealed Judge Brown's decision to the Idaho Supreme Court. A hearing was held on November 9, 2017, and on December 26, 2017, the Idaho Supreme Court rejected Adamcik's appeal for post-conviction relief, upholding the district court decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

==Civil suit by Stoddart family==
In 2010 the Stoddart family filed a civil lawsuit against the Idaho School District. They claimed that the school was negligent and should have known that Draper and Adamcik posed a threat to others. Both the civil court and the State Supreme Court dismissed the case, saying the actions of the killers were not foreseeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nwcn.com/news/idaho/Supreme-Court-tosses-civil-case-in-student-slaying-103472194.html |title=Supreme Court tosses civil case in Pocatello student slaying |publisher=Idaho News |date=2010-09-21 |accessdate=2011-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927154603/http://www.nwcn.com/news/idaho/Supreme-Court-tosses-civil-case-in-student-slaying-103472194.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==US Supreme Court and mandatory life sentences==
In ''[[Miller v. Alabama]]'', {{Ussc|567|460|2012|el=no}}, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruled that mandatory sentences of life without the possibility of parole are unconstitutional for juvenile offenders, even in cases of murder.&lt;ref name="LATimes20120625"&gt;{{cite news|last=Savage|first=David G.|title=Supreme Court rules mandatory juvenile life without parole cruel and unusual|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-supreme-court-rules-juvenile-life-without-parole-cruel-and-unusual-20120625,0,601985.story|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ruled that the youth of the convict had to be considered.

In 2016 the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Montgomery v. Louisiana]]'' that this doctrine had to be applied to cases retroactively, and directed a review of all such cases, potentially 1200 to 1500 nationwide. Given juveniles' brain immaturity, the Supreme Court ruled that there had to be an opportunity to consider mitigating factors, as well as for later review of the sentences of such inmates, with possible relief for persons who had reformed. It said that "children who commit even heinous crimes are capable of change."&lt;ref name="ussc"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-juveniles-sentenced-to-life-have-option-for-new-reviews/2016/01/25/06e3dfc2-c378-11e5-8965-0607e0e265ce_story.html "Supreme Court: Life sentences on juveniles open for later reviews"], ''Washington Post'', 25 January 2016; accessed 9 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Draper and Adamcik are among the cases that the state courts will review under this ruling.

[[File:Oil Slick in the Timor Sea September-2009.jpg|thumb|Oil slick from the [[Montara oil spill]] in the Timor Sea, September 2009]]

An '''oil spill''' is the release of a [[liquid]] [[petroleum]] [[hydrocarbon]] into the environment, especially the marine ecosystem, due to human activity, and is a form of [[pollution]].  The term is usually given to [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] oil spills, where oil is released into the [[ocean]] or [[coastal waters]], but spills may also occur on land.  Oil spills may be due to releases of [[crude oil]] from [[oil tanker|tankers]], [[Oil platform|offshore platforms]], [[drilling rig]]s and [[Oil well|wells]], as well as spills of [[Oil refinery|refined petroleum products]] (such as [[gasoline]], [[diesel fuel|diesel]]) and their by-products, heavier fuels used by large ships such as [[bunker fuel]], or the spill of any oily refuse or [[waste oil]].

Solby's academically accelerated class took off on a mass journey to discover the advanced reasoning behind such science of oil and water. Below is the research they concluded. 

Oil spills penetrate into the structure of the [[plumage]] of birds and the [[fur]] of mammals, reducing its insulating ability, and making them more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and much less [[buoyancy|buoyant]] in the water. Cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water (affecting evaporation and biodegradation), and the types of shorelines and beaches involved.&lt;ref name="common dreams 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0322-04.htm |title=Lingering Lessons of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill |publisher=Commondreams.org |date=2004-03-22 |accessdate=2012-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613042140/http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0322-04.htm |archivedate=June 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spills may take weeks, months or even years to clean up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://vimeo.com/10216588 |title=Hindsight and Foresight, 20 Years After the Exxon Valdez Spill| accessdate=2010-04-30  |first=NOAA Ocean Media Center| date=2010-03-16 |publisher=NOAA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil spills can have disastrous consequences for society; economically, environmentally, and socially. As a result, oil spill accidents have initiated intense media attention and political uproar, bringing many together in a political struggle concerning government response to oil spills and what actions can best prevent them from happening.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wout Broekema | title= Crisis-induced learning and issue politicization in the EU | publisher=Public Administration| url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/padm.12170/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false| date=April 2015 | doi=10.1111/padm.12170 | journal=Public Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|List of oil spills}}
Crude oil and refined fuel spills from [[tanker (ship)|tanker ship]] accidents have damaged vulnerable [[ecosystem]]s in [[Alaska]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the [[Galapagos Islands]], [[France]], the [[Sundarbans]], Ogoniland, and many other places. The quantity of oil spilled during accidents has ranged from a few hundred tons to several hundred thousand tons (e.g., [[Bp oil spill|''Deepwater Horizon'' Oil Spill]], ''[[Atlantic Empress]]'', ''[[Amoco Cadiz]]''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-bp-s-blowout-ranks-among-top-5-oil-spills-in-1-graphic www.scientificamerican.com 20150-04-20 How BP's Blowout Ranks among Top 5 Oil Spills in 1 Graphic]&lt;/ref&gt; but volume is a limited measure of damage or impact. Smaller spills have already proven to have a great impact on ecosystems, such as the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill]] because of the remoteness of the site or the difficulty of an emergency environmental response.

Since 2004, between 300 and 700 barrels of oil per day have been leaking from the site of an oil-production platform 12 miles off the [[Louisiana]] coast which sank in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Ivan]]. The oil spill, which officials estimate could continue throughout the 21st century, will eventually overtake the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizion disaster as the largest ever, but there are currently no efforts to cap the many leaking well heads. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/a-14-year-long-oil-spill-in-the-gulf-of-mexico-verges-on-becoming-one-of-the-worst-in-us-history/2018/10/20/f9a66fd0-9045-11e8-bcd5-9d911c784c38_story.html?utm_term=.7f32147b7dc5| Washington Post, October 21, 2018] &lt;/ref&gt;

Oil spills at sea are generally much more damaging than those on land, since they can spread for hundreds of nautical miles in a thin [[oil slick]] which can cover beaches with a thin coating of oil. These can kill seabirds, mammals, shellfish and other organisms they coat. Oil spills on land are more readily containable if a makeshift earth dam can be rapidly [[bulldozed]] around the spill site before most of the oil escapes, and land animals can avoid the oil more easily.

==Human impact==
An oil spill represents an immediate fire hazard.  The [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] produced [[air pollution]] that caused respiratory distress.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}  The [[Deepwater Horizon explosion|''Deepwater Horizon'' explosion]] killed eleven oil rig workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-05-25-oil-spill-victims-memorial_N.htm | work=USA Today | first1=William M. | last1=Welch | first2=Chris | last2=Joyner | title=Memorial service honors 11 dead oil rig workers | date=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fire resulting from the [[Lac-Mégantic derailment]] killed 47 and destroyed half of the town's centre.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Spilled oil can also contaminate drinking water supplies.  For example, in 2013 two different oil spills contaminated water supplies for 300,000 in [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]], [[Malaysia]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2012/03/05/Oil-spill-disrupts-water-supply.aspx|title=Oil spill disrupts water supply - Nation - The Star Online|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 80,000 people in [[Coca, Ecuador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/352087|title=Ecuador oil spill threatens Brazilian water supply|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, springs were contaminated by an oil spill in [[Clark County, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=002Uxd|title=Kentucky Crude Oil Spill may reach river, contaminate drinking water|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contamination can have an economic impact on tourism and marine resource extraction industries.  For example, the ''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill impacted beach tourism and fishing along the Gulf Coast, and the responsible parties were required to compensate economic victims.

Animals who rely on scent to find their babies or mothers cannot due to the strong scent of the oil. This causes a baby to be rejected and abandoned, leaving the babies to starve and eventually die. Oil can impair a bird's ability to fly, preventing it from foraging or escaping from predators.  As they [[Personal grooming#In animals|preen]], birds may ingest the oil coating their feathers, irritating the [[digestive tract]], altering [[liver]] function, and causing [[kidney]] damage.  Together with their diminished foraging capacity, this can rapidly result in [[dehydration]] and [[metabolism|metabolic]] imbalance.  Some birds exposed to petroleum also experience changes in their hormonal balance, including changes in their [[luteinizing]] protein.&lt;ref&gt;C.

Heavily furred {{nowrap|[[marine mammal]]s}} exposed to oil spills are affected in similar ways.  Oil coats the fur of [[sea otters]] and [[Pinniped|seals]], reducing its insulating effect, and leading to fluctuations in [[body temperature]] and [[hypothermia]].  Oil can also blind an animal, leaving it defenseless.  The ingestion of oil causes dehydration and impairs the digestive process.  Animals can be poisoned, and may die from oil entering the lungs or liver.

There are three kinds of oil-consuming bacteria. [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria]] (SRB) and acid-producing bacteria are [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]], while general aerobic bacteria (GAB) are [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]]. These bacteria occur naturally and will act to remove oil from an ecosystem, and their biomass will tend to replace other populations in the food chain. The chemicals from the oil which dissolve in water, and hence are available to bacteria, are those in the [[water associated fraction]] of the oil.

In addition, oil spills can also harm air quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Middlebrook|first1=A. M.|last2=Murphy|first2=D. M.|last3=Ahmadov|first3=R.|last4=Atlas|first4=E.

Burning surface oil can also be a source for pollution such as soot particles.

==Sources and rate of occurrence==
A [[VLCC]] tanker can carry {{convert|2|Moilbbl|m3}} of crude oil. This is about eight times the amount spilled in the widely known [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill]]. In this spill, the ship ran aground and dumped {{convert|260000|oilbbl|m3}} of oil into the ocean in March 1989. Despite efforts of scientists, managers, and volunteers over 400,000 [[seabirds]], about 1,000 [[sea otters]], and immense numbers of fish were killed.&lt;ref name="Panetta"&gt;Panetta, L. E. (Chair) (2003). America's living oceans: charting a course for sea change [Electronic Version, CD] Pew Oceans Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the volume of oil carried by sea, however, tanker owners' organisations often argue that the industry's safety record is excellent, with only a tiny fraction of a percentage of oil cargoes carried ever being spilled. The [[International Association of Independent Tanker Owners]] has observed that "accidental oil spills this decade have been at record low levels—one third of the previous decade and one tenth of the 1970s—at a time when oil transported has more than doubled since the mid 1980s."

Oil tankers are just one of the many sources of oil spills. According to the [[United States Coast Guard]], 35.7% of the volume of oil spilled in the United States from 1991 to 2004 came from tank vessels (ships/barges), 27.6% from facilities and other non-vessels, 19.9% from non-tank vessels, and 9.3% from pipelines; 7.4% from mystery spills.&lt;ref name="csd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-m/nmc/response/stats/Summary.htm |title=Cumulative Spill Data and Graphics |accessdate=2008-04-10 |author=United States Coast Guard |authorlink=United States Coast Guard |date= |year=2007 |month= |work= |publisher=United States Coast Guard |location= |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl=http://www.allcountries.org/uscensus/390_oil_spills_in_u_s_water.html |archivedate=2008-10-08 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, only 5% of the actual spills came from oil tankers, while 51.8% came from other kinds of vessels.&lt;ref name="csd"/&gt;

The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation has tracked 9,351 accidental spills that have occurred since 1974.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itopf.com/information-services/data-and-statistics/statistics/ |title= Oil Tanker Spill Information Pack |accessdate=2008-10-08 |author=International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation |authorlink=International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation |date= |year=2008 |month= |work= |publisher=International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation |location=London |pages= |language= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this study, most spills result from routine operations such as loading cargo, discharging cargo, and taking on fuel oil.&lt;ref name="itopf"/&gt; 91% of the operational oil spills are small, resulting in less than 7 metric tons per spill.&lt;ref name="itopf"/&gt; On the other hand, spills resulting from accidents like collisions, groundings, hull failures, and explosions are much larger, with 84% of these involving losses of over 700 metric tons.&lt;ref name="itopf"/&gt;

==Cleanup and recovery==

Cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water (affecting evaporation and biodegradation), and the types of shorelines and beaches involved.&lt;ref name="common dreams 1" /&gt; Physical cleanups of oil spills are also very expensive. However, microorganisms such as [[Fusobacteria]] species demonstrate an innovative potential for future oil spill cleanup because of their ability to colonize and degrade oil slicks on the sea surface.&lt;ref name="pmid27681918"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Gutierrez T, Berry D, Teske A, Aitken MD| title=Enrichment of Fusobacteria in Sea Surface Oil Slicks from the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. | journal=Microorganisms | year= 2016 | volume= 4 | issue= 3 | pages=  | pmid=27681918 | doi=10.3390/microorganisms4030024 | pmc=5039584 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=27681918  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Bioremediation Accelerator: Oleophilic, hydrophobic chemical, containing no bacteria, which chemically and physically bonds to both soluble and insoluble hydrocarbons. The bioremediation accelerator acts as a herding agent in water and on the surface, floating molecules to the surface of the water, including solubles such as phenols and BTEX, forming gel-like agglomerations. Undetectable levels of hydrocarbons can be obtained in produced water and manageable water columns. By overspraying sheen with bioremediation accelerator, sheen is eliminated within minutes. Whether applied on land or on water, the nutrient-rich emulsion creates a bloom of local, indigenous, pre-existing, hydrocarbon-consuming bacteria. Those specific bacteria break down the hydrocarbons into water and carbon dioxide, with EPA tests showing 98% of alkanes biodegraded in 28 days; and aromatics being biodegraded 200 times faster than in nature they also sometimes use the hydrofireboom to clean the oil up by taking it away from most of the oil and burning it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/emergencies/content/ncp/products/s200.htm |title=S-200 &amp;#124; NCP Product Schedule &amp;#124; Emergency Management &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the components of oil washed up along a shoreline can be broken down by bacteria and other microorganisms into harmless substances such as fatty acids and carbon dioxide.

The natural process can be speeded up by the addition of fertilizing nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous, which stimulate growth of the microorganisms concerned.

&lt;!-- Unsourced addition could possibly be integrated into or added to above paragraph: "Use dispersants to break up the oil and speed its natural biodegradation. Dispersants act by reducing the surface tension that stops oil and water from mixing. Small droplets of oil are then formed, which helps promote rapid dilution of the oil by water movements. The formation of droplets also increases the oil surface area, thus increasing the exposure to natural evaporation and bacterial action. Dispersants are most effective when used within an hour or two of the initial spill. However, they are not appropriate for all oils and all locations. Successful dispersion of oil through the water column can affect marine organisms like deep-water corals and sea grass. It can also cause oil to be temporarily accumulated by subtidal seafood. Decisions on whether or not to use dispersants to combat an oil spill must be made in each individual case. The decision will take into account the time since the spill, the weather conditions, the particular environment involved, and the type of oil that has been spilt." --&gt;

They clean up oil spills by changing the physical state of spilled oil from liquid to a solid, semi-solid or a rubber-like material that floats on water.&lt;ref name="Sarbatly R. 2016 8–16"/&gt; Solidifiers are [[insoluble]] in water, therefore the removal of the solidified oil is easy and the oil will not leach out. Solidifiers have been proven to be relatively non-toxic to aquatic and wild life and have been proven to suppress harmful vapors commonly associated with hydrocarbons such as [[benzene]], [[xylene]] and [[naphtha]]. The reaction time for solidification of oil is controlled by the surface area or size of the polymer or dry pellets as well as the viscosity and thickness of the oil layer. Some solidifier product manufactures claim the solidified oil can be thawed and used if frozen with dry ice or disposed of in landfills, recycled as an additive in asphalt or rubber products, or burned as a low ash fuel. A solidifier called C.I.Agent (manufactured by [[C.I.Agent Solutions]] of [[Louisville, Kentucky]]) is being used by [[BP]] in granular form, as well as in Marine and Sheen Booms at [[Dauphin Island, Alabama|Dauphin Island]] and [[Fort Morgan, Alabama]], to aid in the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] cleanup.
* Vacuum and [[centrifuge]]:  oil can be sucked up along with the water, and then a centrifuge can be used to separate the oil from the water - allowing a tanker to be filled with near pure oil.  Usually, the water is returned to the sea, making the process more efficient, but allowing small amounts of oil to go back as well. This issue has hampered the use of centrifuges due to a United States regulation limiting the amount of oil in water returned to the sea.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20100624&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/25/us/25clean.html |title=Advances in Oil Spill Cleanup Lag Since Valdez |publisher=New York Times |first=Henry |last=Fountain |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Beach Raking:  coagulated oil that is left on the beach can be picked up by machinery.

* Vacuums: remove oil from beaches and water surface
* [[Shovel]]s and other road equipment: typically used to clean up oil on beaches

===Prevention===
{{Further|Offshore oil spill prevention and response}}
* Secondary containment - methods to prevent releases of oil or hydrocarbons into environment.
* Oil Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) program by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]].
* Double-hulling - build [[double hull]]s into vessels, which reduces the risk and severity of a spill in case of a collision or grounding. Existing single-hull vessels can also be rebuilt to have a double hull.
* Thick-hulled railroad transport tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/07/09/quebec-tragedy-unlikely-slow-oil-shipments-via-rail/KGKrxeEe84Rixz3R47DFvJ/story.html|title=Quebec tragedy unlikely to slow oil shipments via rail|work=BostonGlobe.com|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spill response procedures should include elements such as; 
* A listing of appropriate protective clothing, safety equipment, and cleanup materials required 
for spill cleanup (gloves, respirators, etc.) and an explanation of their proper use; 
* Appropriate evacuation zones and procedures; 
* Availability of fire suppression equipment; 
* Disposal containers for spill cleanup materials; and 
* The first aid procedures that might be required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemstore.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Guide-for-Chemical-Spill-Response-Planning1.pdf |title=Oil Spill Response Procedure |publisher=Chemstore UK |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) mapping==
Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) maps are used to identify sensitive shoreline resources prior to an oil spill event in order to set priorities for protection and plan cleanup strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/maps-and-spatial-data/environmental-sensitivity-index-esi-maps.html|title=Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) Maps|accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/ |title=NOAA's Ocean Service Office of Response and Restoration |publisher=Response.restoration.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; By planning spill response ahead of time, the impact on the environment can be minimized or prevented.  Environmental sensitivity index maps are basically made up of information within the following three categories:  shoreline type, and biological and human-use resources.&lt;ref name="NOAA 2002"&gt;NOAA (2002).  Environmental Sensitivity Index Guidelines, version 3.0. NOAA Technical Memorandum NOS OR&amp;R 11. Seattle:  Hazardous Response and Assessment Division, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 129p.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shoreline type===
[[Shoreline]] type is classified by rank depending on how easy the target site would be to clean up, how long the oil would persist, and how sensitive the shoreline is.&lt;ref&gt;Gundlach, E.R. and M.O. Hayes (1978). Vulnerability of Coastal Environments to Oil Spill Impacts. Marine Technology Society.  12 (4): 18-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  The floating oil slicks put the shoreline at particular risk when they eventually come ashore, covering the [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]] with oil.  The differing substrates between shoreline types vary in their response to oiling, and influence the type of cleanup that will be required to effectively decontaminate the shoreline.  In 1995, the US [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] extended ESI maps to lakes, rivers, and estuary shoreline types.&lt;ref name="NOAA 2002"/&gt;  The exposure the shoreline has to wave energy and tides, substrate type, and slope of the shoreline are also taken into account—in addition to biological productivity and sensitivity.  The productivity of the shoreline habitat is also taken into account when determining ESI ranking.&lt;ref name="NOAA 2008"&gt;NOAA (2008).  Introduction to Environmental Sensitivity Index maps.  NOAA Technical Manual.  Seattle:  Hazardous Response and Assessment Division, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 56p.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mangroves]] and marshes tend to have higher ESI rankings due to the potentially long-lasting and damaging effects of both the oil contamination and cleanup actions.  Impermeable and exposed surfaces with high wave action are ranked lower due to the reflecting waves keeping oil from coming onshore, and the speed at which natural processes will remove the oil.

===Biological resources===
Habitats of plants and animals that may be at risk from oil spills are referred to as "elements" and are divided by functional group.  Further classification divides each element into species groups with similar life histories and behaviors relative to their vulnerability to oil spills.  There are eight element groups:  Birds, Reptiles, Amphibians, Fish, Invertebrates, Habitats and Plants, Wetlands, and Marine Mammals and Terrestrial Mammals.  Element groups are further divided into sub-groups, for example, the ‘marine mammals’ element group is divided into [[dolphins]], manatees, [[pinnipeds]] (seals, sea lions &amp; walruses), [[polar bears]], [[sea otters]] and [[whales]].&lt;ref name="NOAA 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOAA 2008"/&gt;  Problems taken into consideration when ranking biological resources include the observance of a large number of individuals in a small area, whether special life stages occur ashore (nesting or molting), and whether there are species present that are threatened, endangered or rare.&lt;ref name="IPIECA 1994"&gt;[[International Maritime Organization|IMO]]/[[IPIECA]] (1994). Sensitivity Mapping for Oil Spill Response. International Maritime Organization/ International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association Report Series, Volume 1. 22p.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human-use resources===
Human use resources are divided into four major classifications; [[archaeological]] importance or cultural resource site, high-use recreational areas or shoreline access points, important protected management areas, or resource origins.&lt;ref name="NOAA 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPIECA 1994"/&gt; Some examples include airports, diving sites, popular beach sites, marinas, natural reserves or marine sanctuaries.

==Estimating the volume of a spill==
By observing the thickness of the film of oil and its appearance on the surface of the water, it is possible to estimate the quantity of oil spilled. If the surface area of the spill is also known, the total volume of the oil can be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;''Metcalf &amp; Eddy. Wastewater Engineering, Treatment and Reuse. 4th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2003. 98.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil spill model systems are used by industry and government to assist in planning and emergency decision making. Of critical importance for the skill of the oil spill model prediction is the adequate description of the wind and current fields. There is a worldwide oil spill modelling (WOSM) program.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, E.L., E. Howlett, K. Jayko, V. Kolluru, M. Reed, and M. Spaulding. 1993. The worldwide oil spill model (WOSM): an overview. Pp. 627–646 in Proceedings of the 16th Arctic and Marine Oil Spill Program, Technical Seminar. Ottawa, Ontario: Environment Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tracking the scope of an oil spill may also involve verifying that hydrocarbons collected during an ongoing spill are derived from the active spill or some other source.  This can involve sophisticated analytical chemistry focused on finger printing an oil source based on the complex mixture of substances present.  Largely, these will be various hydrocarbons, among the most useful being [[polyaromatic hydrocarbons]].  In addition, both oxygen and nitrogen heterocyclic hydrocarbons, such as parent and alkyl homologues of [[carbazole]], [[quinoline]], and [[pyridine]], are present in many crude oils.  As a result, these compounds have great potential to supplement the existing suite of hydrocarbons targets to fine-tune source tracking of petroleum spills.  Such analysis can also be used to follow weathering and degradation of crude spills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Z. | last2 = Fingas | first2 = M. | last3 = Page | first3 = D.S. | year = 1999 | title = Oil spill identification | url = | journal = Journal of Chromatography A | volume = 843 | issue = | pages = 369–411 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9673(99)00120-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pelicar''', also written '''Pellicar''' or '''Belicar''' was a [[Guanches|Guanche]] [[mencey]] king of [[Menceyato of Icode]] in times of the conquest of [[Tenerife]] in the fifteenth century.

Pelicar joined the king of [[Menceyato de Taoro]], [[Bencomo]], to repel the [[Spain|Spanish]] invasion in 1494, including its menceyato in war camps. However, some historians as [[Viera y Clavijo]] indicate that Pelicar not allied with Bencomo, as wary of the ambitions of this. Finally, after successive defeats and the loss of key Guanche kings ([[Bencomo]], [[Tinguaro]] and [[Bentor]]), the mencey of Icode surrendered in 1496, subject to the conquerors in the act known as [[Paz de Los Realejos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdc.ulpgc.es/cdm/singleitem/collection/MDC/id/44128/rec/1 La Conquista de Tenerife (1494-1496)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pelicar was taken to the court of the [[Catholic Monarchs]] by [[Alonso Fernández de Lugo]] along with six other menceyes to be presented to the monarchs. And in court, Pelicar was sold into slavery unfairly by the royal butler [[Pedro Patiño]], who had been delivered to be his guardian, being released by royal command soon after. The ultimate fate of mencey except possibly ending his days in [[Seville]] as a free man is not known.

'''Phi Tai Hong''' ({{lang-th|ผีตายโหง}}) is a [[ghost]] of [[Thai folklore]]. It is the [[Vengeful ghost|vengeful]] and restless [[spirit]] of a person who suffered a violent or cruel death.

==Legends==
''Phi Tai Hong'' usually has its origin in a man or a woman who died suddenly, often without the observance of proper [[Funeral (Buddhism)|funerary ritual]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaiworldview.com/bouddha/animism5.htm Spirits]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Royal Institute Dictionary|Royal Institute Dictionary 1999]]'', the official dictionary of Thai words, ''tai hong'' means "to die an unnatural and violent death, such as being murdered or drowning" and ''Phi Tai Hong'' means the ghost of a person who died in such manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | script-title = th:พจนานุกรม ฉบับราชบัณฑิตยสถาน พ.ศ. 2542 | trans-title = Royal Institute Dictionary 1999 | quote = ผีตายโหง : น. คนที่ตายผิดธรรมดาโดยอาการร้ายเช่นถูกฆ่าตาย ตกน้ำตาย. โหง ๑ : น. ผี; เรียกการตายผิดธรรมดาโดยอาการร้าย เช่นถูกฆ่าตาย ตกนํ้าตาย ว่า ตายโหง. | publisher = [[Royal Institute of Thailand]] | date = 2007 | accessdate = 2014-04-09 | language = Thai | url = http://rirs3.royin.go.th/dictionary.asp | location = Bangkok | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090303000030/http://rirs3.royin.go.th/dictionary.asp | archivedate = 2009-03-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thai [[oral tradition]] ''Phi Tai Hong'' are very dangerous for they are usually full of resentment and may easily kill people. The spirit of a person who was assassinated will seek retribution and will eventually threaten and seek to kill the murderers, as well as people that may be close to them when the spirit is active. As a consequence ''Phi Tai Hong'' are among the most feared ghosts, especially in the form known as ''Tai Thang Klom'' (ตายทั้งกลม) or  ''Tai Thong Klom'' (ตายท้องกลม),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimbio.com/Thailand/articles/DAe64TBCLLk/Introduction+Ghost+Thai+Culture Ghosts in Thai Culture]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEQ0tBTmEH4 ผีตายท้องกลม]&lt;/ref&gt; which is the ghost of a woman who died together with her child in her womb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | script-title = th:พจนานุกรม ฉบับราชบัณฑิตยสถาน พ.ศ. 2542 | trans-title = Royal Institute Dictionary 1999 | quote = ทั้งกลม : ว. ทั้งปวง, ทั้งหมด, ทั้งสิ้น; เรียกหญิงที่ตายพร้อมกับลูก ที่อยู่ในท้องด้วยว่า ตายทั้งกลม คือ ตายทั้งหมด. ผีตายทั้งกลม : น. หญิงที่ตายในขณะที่ลูกยังอยู่ในท้อง. | publisher = [[Royal Institute of Thailand]] | date = 2007 | accessdate = 2014-04-09 | language = Thai | url = http://rirs3.royin.go.th/dictionary.asp | location = Bangkok | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090303000030/http://rirs3.royin.go.th/dictionary.asp | archivedate = 2009-03-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many instances in Thailand in which people claim that such spirits are real.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NadDzqXEkzY เรื่องจริงผ่านจอ ผีตายทั้งกลม - Tai Thong Klom real story]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.sanook.com/player/394224/%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B7%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%9C%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%AD-:-%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%8D%E0%B8%8D%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%93%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%97%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%A1 เรื่องจริงผ่านจอ : วิญญาณตายท้องกลม]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thai culture blames this lethal spirit as one of the ghosts that [[Haunted house|haunt houses]] and one of the most difficult to [[exorcise]]. Exorcisms can be very complicated, involving arcane ceremonies. Stories about this kind of spirit and the exorcism ceremonies that are needed to be free from them are popular in Thai publications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookinthai.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/product_full/9786165312530_s.gif ''Phi Tai Hong'' book]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern adaptations==
''Phi tai hong'' is a ghost that has been featured in many movies of different types, such as  2003 [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai]] comedy-horror film ''[[Buppah Rahtree]]'' and the 2010  film ''[[Tai Hong (film)|Tai Hong]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaiworldview.com/tv/act.php?myChoice=1&amp;mySearch=6 Tai Hong]&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears in many other movies, but in a role less central to the theme. In its ''Tai thang klom'' variant this ghost is featured in the 2010 film ''[[Tai Thang Klom (film)|Tai Thang Klom]]'' ("The Snow White").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tlcthai.com/vdoclip/22364/%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B1%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%A1-%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B9%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%A5/ ''Tai Thong Klom'' movie]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Phi tai hong'' is also a recurring theme in [[Thai television soap opera]]s ''(lakhon)'' such as ''The Sixth Sense'' (สื่อรักสัมผัสหัวใจ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.truelife.com/content/2015931 The Sixth Sense ''Lakhon'']&lt;/ref&gt; the highly successful ''[[Raeng Ngao]]'' (แรงเงา), and in ''[[Fai Huan]]'' (ไฟหวน),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcXVYqTeQnU ไฟหวน Fai Huan ''Lakhon'']&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the more recent [[Nang Chada]] (นางชฎา) with [[Davika Hoorne]] as the [[vengeful ghost]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://asianfuse.net/discuzz/topic/55755-ch7-nang-chada-polyplus/page-3 Ch7 - Nang Chada (PolyPlus)]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Waen Sawat]] (แหวนสวาท) starring 'Pancake' [[Khemanit Jamikorn]] in a [[dual role]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/lakornvideos/posts/415500235288377 Waen Sawat - Ch7 Facebook]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Posterior Circulation Infarct''' ('''POCI''') is a type of [[cerebral infarction]] affecting the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] [[circulatory system|circulation]] supplying one side of the [[brain]].

'''Posterior Circulation Stroke Syndrome''' ('''POCS''') refers to the symptoms of a patient who clinically appears to have had a posterior circulation infarct, but who has not yet had any diagnostic imaging (e.g. [[CT Scan]]) to confirm the diagnosis.

It can cause the following symptoms:
* Cranial nerve palsy AND [[contralateral]] motor/sensory defect
* [[wikt:bilateral|Bilateral]] motor or sensory defect
* Eye movement problems (e.g.[[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]])
* [[Cerebellar]] dysfunction
* Isolated [[homonymous hemianopia]]

It has also been associated with [[deafness]].&lt;ref name="pmid18408371"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee H |title=Sudden deafness related to posterior circulation infarction in the territory of the nonanterior inferior cerebellar artery: frequency, origin, and vascular topographical pattern |journal=Eur.

'''Postmortem caloricity''' is a phenomenon where the body temperature of a [[Cadaver|corpse]] rises or remains unusually high for up to 2 hours after [[death]] instead of falling.

== Cause ==
Postmortem caloricity may (more frequently) be observed in deaths resulting from [[asphyxia]]{{Citation needed|reason=This information was already present in the article, however no source was provided &amp; no source could be found to back up the claim.|date=January 2018}}, poisonings (e.g. with [[datura]]{{Citation needed|reason=This information was already present in the article, however no source was provided &amp; no source could be found to back up the claim.|date=January 2018}}, [[Alcohol intoxication|alcohol]], [[Strychnine poisoning|strychnine]]), [[septicemia]], [[Bacteremia|bactaeremia]], and infectious diseases ([[yellow fever]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1845-08-06|title=Post-Mortem Caloricity of Yellow Fever|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJM184508060330104|journal=The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal|volume=33|issue=1|pages=14–17|doi=10.1056/nejm184508060330104|issn=0096-6762}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[rabies]], [[rheumatic fever]], [[cholera]], [[tetanus]], [[smallpox]]), [[meningitis]], [[peritonitis]], [[nephritis]], brain stem haemorrhages (especially pontine haemorrhages), [[Intracranial injury|intracranial injuries]], [[liver abscess]]es, [[Heat stroke|sunstroke]], etc.

== Mechanism ==
Postmortem heat production is caused by biochemical and microbial activity in the dead body. The cause of postmortem caloricity varies depending on the cause of death:
* Postmortem [[glycogenolysis]] – a phenomenon beginning soon after death observed in nearly all cadavers. In an average adult, postmortem glycogenolysis can produce up to 140 calories of heat which can raise the temperature of the body by up to 2&amp;nbsp;°C.
* Bactaeremia, septicemia, and infectious causes – heat production may be attributed to postmortem microbial activity.
* Sunstroke, and pontine haemorrhages – disruption of thermoregulation prior to death. 
* Tetanus, and strychnine – heat is produced by muscular contractions.
The corpse may also absorb heat from the environment when environmental temperature exceeds that of the body.

A '''punch''' is a [[strike (attack)|striking]] blow with the fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/punch |title=Punch &amp;#124; Define Punch at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in most [[martial art]]s and [[combat sport]]s, most notably [[Boxing]], where it is the only type of offensive technique allowed. In sports, [[hand wrap]]s or other padding such as gloves may be used to protect athletes and practitioners from injuring themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Ringside.com | url = http://www.ringside.com/WrapYourHands.aspx | title = The Proper Way to Wrap Your Hands | accessdate = 2007-07-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070426032249/http://www.ringside.com/WrapYourHands.aspx &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, Willie L. "[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5295269.html Portable Hand Wrap]" Mar 22. 1994. Retrieved on June 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of punches varies between different martial arts and combat sports. Styles such as Boxing, [[Suntukan]] or [[Russian fist fighting]] use punches alone, while others such as [[Kickboxing]], [[Muay Thai]], [[Lethwei]] or [[Karate]] may use both punches and [[kick]]s. Others such as [[wrestling]] and [[judo]] (punches and other striking techniques, [[atemi]], are present in judo kata, but are forbidden in competitions) do not use punches at all. There are many types of punches and as a result, different styles encompass varying types of punching techniques.

|Backfist
|A backfist is performed by forming a fist and striking with the backside of the fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oyama|first=Masutatsu|title=Mas Oyama's Classic Karate|year=2004|publisher=Sterling; Chrysalis (distributor)|location=New York: London|isbn=1-4027-1287-1|others=Translated by Tomoko Murakami|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''spinning backfist'' is performed when the attacker swivels 360 degrees before landing the punch, adding extra momentum to the attack. The fighter will lunge and begin spinning toward the side of the opponent of which fist he or she will attack with. Simpler terms, go to the left, spin to the left and connect with the left fist and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifafitness.com/kickbox/upper/backfist.htm |title=IFA Kickboxing Library |at=Spinning Backfist |website=International Fitness Association |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629174843/http://www.ifafitness.com/kickbox/upper/backfist.htm |archive-date=2016-06-29 |dead-url=yes |first=Tony |last=Carr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Chambered Punch
|A strike commonly performed in karate, kung fu, and tae kwon do, originating from a "chambered" position.
|-
|[[Cross (boxing)|Cross]] or straight
|A direct straight punch similar to the jab, except delivered with the rear hand. Power is generated through the rotation of the hips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scully|first=John|title=Learn To Box|url=http://www.saddoboxing.com/learn.html|publisher=Saddo Boxing|accessdate=25 June 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68h3dmJIF|archivedate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Difference between a cross and a straight punch|url=http://heavyfists.com/right-cross-straight-right-difference|accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Jab]]
|The jab is a straight blow delivered (generally from a distance) with the arm above the lead foot ... The punch is quick and explosive. This punch must land from the very tips of the knuckles and not from a flat fist. " It is generally used for distraction, keeping distance, setting up, and defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jab Punch|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/art-71117|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=29 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013145009/http://www.britannica.com/eb/art-71117/Jab-The-jab-is-a-straight-blow-delivered-with-the|archivedate=13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jab punch|url=http://www.all-karate.com/140/jab-punch-kizami-zuki|publisher=All-Karate.com|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Leopard Blow|Long Fist]]
|By tucking the fingertips against the bottom knuckle of each finger, a long fist is formed. They offer decreased strength but increased reach. The striking surface is also narrower, which allows the fist to dig between ribs and other soft target areas.
|-
|[[Hammer Fist]]
|A compacted fist is brought down upon the target, usually using the outside area of the fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oyama|first=Masutatsu|title=Mas Oyama's Classic Karate|year=2004|publisher=Sterling; Chrysalis (distributor)|location=New York: London|isbn=1-4027-1287-1|others=Translated by Tomoko Murakami|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|Haymaker
|A punch in which the arm is whipped sideways from the shoulder joint with minimal elbow bend. The name is derived from the motion, which mimics the action of manually cutting hay by swinging a [[scythe]]. The haymaker is considered an imperfect/impure punch, as the angle of approach is unsupported by the remainder of the forearm. Since a haymaker's power is derived completely from weight transfer and momentum instead of muscle contraction, a long windup is required to generate sufficient force. Haymakers, in the form of shoulder punches, are frequently used from a [[Mount (grappling)|mounted position]] in [[mixed martial arts]] as part of the "[[ground and pound]]" method, as the legs cannot be used to generate power. When thrown from standing, these punches leave the person vulnerable to a counter punch during the wind up, if blocked, or if the haymaker misses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mongold|first=Brian|title=How to Throw a Punch|url=http://www.eazycheezy.net/2010/04/how-to-throw-a-punch-by-guest-author-the-wolf.html|publisher=Eazycheezy.net|accessdate=25 June 2012|author2=The Wolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Hook (boxing)|Hook]]
|A punch involving the use of turning to aim toward the side of the head or body. This punch must land from the very tips of the knuckles and not from a flat fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hook Punch Technique|url=http://www.physical-arts.com/training/techniques/mn_hook_punch.html|publisher=Physical-Arts.com|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Drop (boxing)|Overhand]]
|A semi-circular and vertical punch thrown with the rear hand. It is usually when the opponent is [[Bobbing (boxing)|bobbing]] or [[slipping]]. The strategic utility of the drop relying on body weight can deliver a great deal of power. This punch must land from the very tips of the knuckles and not from a flat fist.
|-
|Shovel Hook
|A close range punch that is halfway between a hook and an uppercut. Shovel hooks are most commonly used to strike the body at a 45 degree angle. For example, a liver shot can be done using a shovel hook. This punch must land from the very tips of the knuckles and not from a flat fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shovel Hook|url=http://www.boxing4free.com/punches/38-shovel-hook.html|publisher=Boxing4Free.com|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Uppercut]]
|The fist is raised vertically towards the target, usually the head or upper body. Since most guards are held with the arms in a vertical position, the uppercut can be used to avoid the opponent's attempts at blocking. This punch must land from the very tips of the knuckles and not from a flat fist.
|-
|Upset Punch
|Starts with the fist in the chambered position, with the palm facing downwards, delivered to the abdomen or solar plexus.
|-
|Casting Punch
|This is a punch used in [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] and [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] that starts with a forward motion of the shoulders, which causes the bent arm to whip forward to the opponent. This punch can often cause the opponent to be put in a clinch if it misses at close range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaplowitz|first=Matthew|title=How to Throw the Fedor Punch|url=http://www.thefightnerd.com/casting-punch-aka-fedor-punch/|publisher=TheFightNerd.com|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
|- 
|[[Superman punch|Superman Punch]]
|A '''superman punch''' or '''diving punch''' is a technique used in [[Muay Thai]], ITF-style [[Taekwon-Do]], full contact [[karate]] and [[mixed martial arts]] fighting. The striker will lunge toward the opponent pushing off with the back foot punching with the opposite arm of the leg used to push off with although there may be variations in the name and technique, depending on the fighting style. The pose should resemble that of Superman flying through the air, hence the name.

|[[Sucker punch]]
| A punch that takes the enemy by surprise, possibly knocking them out or otherwise incapacitating them. Could be an unexpected blow to the stomach or a strike from behind that the victim did not see coming.

{{main|Boxing punches}}
In boxing, punches are classified according to the motion and direction of the strike; contact is always made with the knuckles. There are four primary punches in boxing: the [[jab]], [[Cross (boxing)|cross]], [[Hook (boxing)|hook]], and [[uppercut]].  
[[Image:JJS Karate Kids on Training.jpg|left|200px|thumb|A karateka performing a 'reverse punch' or [[gyaku zuki]] being performed by two young boys.]]

=== Karate ===
[[File:Seiken.png|thumb|Seiken]]
Punching techniques in [[Karate]] are called ''[[tsuki]]'' or ''zuki''. Contact is made with the first two knuckles (''seiken'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oyama|first=Masutatsu|title=Mas Oyama's Classic Karate|year=2004|publisher=Sterling; Chrysalis (distributor)|location=New York: London|isbn=1-4027-1287-1|others=Translated by Tomoko Murakami|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; If any other part of the hand is used to strike with, such as the back of the fist (''uraken'') or the bottom of the fist (''tetsui''), then the blow is classified as a [[strike (attack)|strike]] (uchi).

Karate punches include the thrust punch ''[[Oi zuki|oi-zuki]]'' made using the lead-hand, straight punch ''[[choku-zuki]]'', reverse punch ''[[gyaku-zuki]]'', made from the opposite (lead) hand, and many other variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Funakoshi|first=Gichin|title=Karate-dō Nyūmon: The Master Introductory Text|year=1994|publisher=Kodansha International|location=Tokyo|isbn=4-7700-1891-6|others=Translated by John Teramoto|pages=51–52, 64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rewilding''' is large-scale conservation aimed at restoring and protecting natural processes and core wilderness areas, providing connectivity between such areas, and protecting or reintroducing [[apex predator]]s and [[keystone species]]. Rewilding projects may require ecological restoration or wilderness engineering, particularly to restore connectivity between fragmented protected areas, and reintroduction of predators and keystone species where extirpated. The ultimate goal of rewilding efforts is to create ecosystems requiring passive management by limiting human control of ecosystems. Successful long term rewilding projects should be considered to have little to no human-based ecological management, as successful reintroduction of [[keystone species]] creates a self-regulatory and self-sustaining  stable [[ecosystem]], with near pre-human levels of biodiversity.

==Origin==
The word ''rewilding'' was coined by conservationist and activist [[David Foreman|Dave Foreman]], one of the founders of the group [[Earth First!]] who went on to help establish both the [[Wildlands Project|Wildlands Project (now the Wildlands Network)]] and the [[Rewilding Institute]].&lt;ref name=fraser3/&gt; The term first occurred in print in 1990&lt;ref name=NW900205/&gt; and was refined by conservation biologists [[Michael E. Soulé|Michael Soulé]] and [[Reed Noss]] in a paper published in 1998.&lt;ref name=MSRN1998/&gt; According to Soulé and Noss, rewilding is a conservation method based on "cores, corridors, and carnivores."&lt;ref name=MSRN2/&gt; The concepts of cores, corridors, and carnivores were developed further in 1999.&lt;ref name=CCSF1999/&gt; Dave Foreman subsequently wrote the first full-length exegesis of rewilding as a conservation strategy.&lt;ref name=foreman2004/&gt;

More recently, anthropologist [[Layla AbdelRahim]] offered a new definition of rewilding: "Wilderness is ... a cumulative topos of diversity, movement, and chaos, while wildness is a characteristic that refers to socio-environmental relationships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = AbdelRahim | first = Layla | authorlink=Layla AbdelRahim | title = Children’s Literature, Domestication, and Social Foundation: Narratives of Civilization and Wilderness | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 978-0-415-66110-2 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her, because civilization is a constantly growing enterprise, it has completely colonized the earth and imperiled life on the planet. Therefore, rewilding can start only with a revolution in the anthropology that constructs the human as predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = AbdelRahim | first = Layla | authorlink=Layla AbdelRahim | title = Children’s Literature, Domestication, and Social Foundation: Narratives of Civilization and Wilderness | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 978-0-415-66110-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Rewilding was developed as a method to preserve functional ecosystems and reduce [[Holocene extinction|biodiversity loss]], incorporating research in [[island biogeography]] and the ecological role of large carnivores.&lt;ref name=stolzenburg2008/&gt; In 1967, ''The Theory of Island Biogeography'' by [[Robert H. MacArthur]] and [[Edward O. Wilson]] established the importance of considering the size and isolation of wildlife conservation areas, stating that protected areas remained vulnerable to extinctions if small and isolated.&lt;ref name=RMEW1967/&gt; In 1987, William D. Newmark's study of extinctions in national parks in North America added weight to the theory.&lt;ref name=newmark1987/&gt; The publications intensified debates on conservation approaches.&lt;ref name=DQ1996/&gt; With the creation of the [[Society for Conservation Biology]] in 1985, conservationists began to focus on reducing habitat loss and fragmentation.&lt;ref name=quammen2/&gt;

==Major rewilding projects==
[[File:Koniks4.JPG|thumb|Between 800 and 1150 wild [[konik]]s live in the [[Oostvaardersplassen]], a 56 km² rewilding project in the [[Netherlands]]]]

Both [[grassroots]] groups and major international conservation organizations have incorporated rewilding into projects to protect and restore [[Edge effects|large-scale core wilderness areas]], [[Wildlife corridor|corridors]] (or connectivity) between them, and apex predators, carnivores, or keystone species (species which interact strongly with the environment, such as elephant and beaver).&lt;ref name=fraser2/&gt; Projects include the [[Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative]] in North America (also known as Y2Y) and the [[European Green Belt]], built along the former Iron Curtain; transboundary projects, including those in southern Africa funded by the [http://www.peaceparks.org/Home.htm Peace Parks Foundation]; community-conservation projects, such as the wildlife conservancies of Namibia and Kenya; and projects organized around ecological restoration, including [[Gondwana Link]], regrowing native bush in a hotspot of endemism in southwest Australia, and the [[Area de Conservacion Guanacaste]], restoring dry tropical forest and rainforest in Costa Rica.&lt;ref name=fraser2009/&gt; [[European Wildlife]], established in 2008, advocates the establishment of a ''European Centre of Biodiversity'' at the German–Austrian–Czech borders.

In North America, another major project aims to restore the [[Prairie|prairie grasslands of the Great Plains]].&lt;ref name=manning2009/&gt; The [http://www.americanprairie.org/ American Prairie Foundation] is reintroducing [[bison]] on private land in the [[Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument|Missouri Breaks]] region of north-central Montana, with the goal of creating a prairie preserve larger than [[Yellowstone National Park]].&lt;ref name=manning2/&gt;

An organization called [[Rewilding Australia]] has formed which intends to restore various marsupials and other Australian animals which have been extirpated from the mainland, such as [[Eastern quoll|Eastern quolls]] and [[Tasmanian devil|Tasmanian devils]].[http://rewildaustralia.org/]

=== Projects in Europe ===
[[File:Bison bonasus (Linnaeus 1758).jpg|thumb|[[European bison]] (''Bison bonasus''); Europe's largest living land animal. The European bison was driven to extinction in the wild in 1927; in the mid-20th century and early 21st century, the bison has been re-introduced into the wild. The bison stands nearly 2 metres tall and weighs as much as 1,000 kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/21/-sp-european-bison-europe-romania-carpathian-mountains|title=Return of the European Bison|publisher=The Guardian|access-date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the 1980s, the Dutch government began introducing proxy species in the [[Oostvaardersplassen]] nature reserve in order to recreate a grassland ecology.&lt;ref name=TS140501/&gt;&lt;ref name=TNY1212/&gt; Though not explicitly referred to as rewilding, nevertheless many of the goals and intentions of the project were in line with those of rewilding. The reserve is considered somewhat controversial due to the lack of predators and other native megafauna such as [[grey wolf|wolves]], [[Brown bear|bears]], [[lynx]], [[Moose|elke]], [[Wild boar|boar]], and [[wisent]].

In 2011, the '[[Rewilding Europe]]' initiative was established with the aim of rewilding 1 million hectares of land in ten areas including the western [[Iberian Peninsula]], [[Velebit]], the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] and the [[Danube]] delta by 2020, mostly abandoned farmland among other identified candidate site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rewildingeurope.com/about-us/the-foundation/&lt;/ref&gt; The present project considers only species that are still present in Europe, such as the [[Iberian lynx]], [[Eurasian lynx]], [[wolf]], [[European jackal]], [[Brown bear]], [[chamois]], [[Spanish ibex]], [[European bison]], [[red deer]], [[griffon vulture]], [[cinereous vulture]], [[Egyptian vulture]], [[Great white pelican]] and [[Vipera ammodytes|horned viper]], along with a few primitive breeds of [[domestic horse]] and [[cattle]] as proxies for the extinct [[tarpan]] and [[aurochs]]. Since 2012, Rewilding Europe is heavily involved in the [[Tauros Programme]], which seeks to recreate the [[phenotype]] of the aurochs, the wild ancestors of domestic cattle by selectively breeding existing breeds of cattle.&lt;ref name=RWE121108/&gt; Many projects also employ domestic water buffalo as a grazing proxy for the extinct European water buffal.

In 2010 and 2011, an unrelated initiative in the village of San Cebrián de Mudá (190 inhabitants) in [[Province of Palencia|Palencia]], northern [[Spain]] released 18 [[European bison]]s (a species extinct in Spain since the [[Middle Ages]]) in a natural area already inhabited by [[roe deer]], [[wild boar]], [[red fox]] and [[grey wolf]], as part of the creation of a 240-hectare "Quaternary Park". Three [[Przewalski horse]]s from a breeding center in Le Villaret, [[France]] were added to the park in October 2012.&lt;ref name=DP121025/&gt; [[Asian Wild Ass|Onager]]s and "aurochs" were planned to follow.&lt;ref name=SCDM111120/&gt;

On 11 April 2013, eight European bison (one male, five females and two calves) were released into the wild in the Bad Berleburg region of [[Germany]], after 300 years of absence from the region.&lt;ref name=MB130418/&gt;

==Pleistocene rewilding==
{{main|Pleistocene rewilding}}

Pleistocene rewilding was proposed by the Brazilian ecologist [[Mauro Galetti]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=galetti2004/&gt; He suggested the introduction of elephants (and other proxies of extinct megafauna) from circuses and zoos to private lands in the Brazilian cerrado. In 2005, stating that much of the original megafauna of North America—including mammoths, ground sloths, and sabre-toothed cats—became extinct after the arrival of humans, [[Paul S. Martin]] proposed restoring the ecological balance by replacing them with species which have similar ecological roles, such as Asian or African elephants.&lt;ref name=martin2005/&gt;

A reserve now exists for formerly captive elephants on the Brazilian Cerrado [https://globalelephants.org/]

A controversial 2005 editorial in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', signed by a number of conservation biologists, took up the argument, urging that elephants, lions, and cheetahs could be reintroduced in protected areas in the Great Plains.&lt;ref name="nature050818" /&gt; The [[Bolson tortoise]], discovered in 1959 in Durango, Mexico, was the first species proposed for this restoration effort, and in 2006 the species was reintroduced to two ranches in New Mexico owned by media mogul [[Ted Turner]]. Other proposed species include various camelids, equids, and peccaries.

In 1988, researcher [[Sergey Zimov|Sergey A. Zimov]] established the [[Pleistocene Park]] in northeastern Siberia to test the possibility of restoring a full range of grazers and predators, with the aim of recreating an ecosystem similar to the one in which mammoths lived.&lt;ref name=science050506/&gt; Yakutian horses, reindeer, snow sheep, elk, yak and moose were reintroduced, and reintroduction is also planned for bactrian camels, red deer, and Siberian tigers. The wood bison, a close relative of the ancient bison that died out in Siberia 1000 or 2000 years ago, is also an important species for the ecology of Siberia. In 2006, 30 bison calves were flown from Edmonton, Alberta to Yakutsk and placed in the government-run reserve of Ust'-Buotama. This project remains controversial — a letter published in ''[[Conservation Biology (journal)|Conservation Biology]]'' accused the Pleistocene camp of promoting "Frankenstein ecosystems," stating that "the biggest problem is not the possibility of failing to restore lost interactions, but rather the risk of getting new, unwanted interactions instead."&lt;ref name=CB24/&gt; The authors proposed that—rather than trying to restore a lost megafauna—conservationists should dedicate themselves to restoring existing species to their original habitats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35886">{{Ancient Roman religion}}

'''Roman funerary practices''' include the [[Classical antiquity|Ancient]] [[Ancient Romans|Romans]]' [[Ancient Roman religion|religious rituals]] concerning [[funeral]]s, [[cremation]]s, and [[burial]]s. They were part of the [[mos maiorum|Tradition]] ({{lang-la|mos maiorum}}), the unwritten code from which Romans derived their social norms.{{refn|Literally, the "way of the greater ones" but understood as "the way of the ancestors".}}

Roman [[cemetery|cemeteries]] were located outside the [[pomerium|sacred boundary]] of its cities (''{{lang|la|pomerium}}''). They were visited regularly with offerings of food and wine, and special observances during [[Roman festivals]] in honor of the dead. Funeral monuments appear throughout the [[Roman Empire]], and their [[inscription]]s are an important source of information for otherwise unknown individuals and [[history of the Roman Empire|history]]. A Roman [[sarcophagus]] could be an elaborately crafted art work, decorated with [[relief]] [[Roman sculpture|sculpture]] depicting a scene that was [[allegory|allegorical]], [[classical mythology|mythological]], or historical, or a scene from everyday life.

Although funerals were primarily a concern of the family, which was of paramount importance in Roman society, those who lacked the support of an extended family usually belonged to guilds or ''[[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegia]]'' which provided funeral services for members.

==Care of the dead== &lt;!--linked--&gt;
In [[classical antiquity|Greco-Roman antiquity]], the bodies of the dead were regarded as polluting.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Renee Salzman, "Religious ''koine'' and Religious Dissent," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[pietas (virtue)|loving duty toward one's ancestors]] (''{{lang|la|pietas}}'') was a fundamental part of [[Culture of ancient Rome|ancient Roman culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Heid, "The Romanness of Roman Christianity," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; The care of the dead negotiated these two emotionally opposed attitudes.

===Preparation of the body===
When a person died at home, family members and intimate friends gathered around the death bed. In accordance with a belief that equated the soul with the breath, the closest relative sealed the passing of spirit from the body with a last kiss, and closed the eyes. The relatives began [[lament]]ations, calling on the deceased by name. The body was then placed on the ground, washed, and [[Anointing|anointed]]. The placing of the body on the ground is a doublet of birth ritual, when the infant was placed on the bare earth.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Corbeill, ''Nature Embodied: Gesture in Ancient Rome'' (Princeton University Press, 2004), p. 90, with a table of other parallels between birth and death rituals on p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mourners were expected to wear the dress appropriate to the occasion, and to their station; an elite male citizen might wear a ''[[Toga#Varieties|toga pulla]]'' (a "dark" toga, reserved for funerals).&lt;ref&gt;A plain white toga was also acceptable; those with a ''toga praetexta'' could turn it inside out, to conceal its purple stripe; see Flower, Harriet F., ''Ancestor Masks and Aristocratic Power in Roman Culture'', Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heskel, J., ''in'' Sebesta, Judith Lynn, and Bonfante, Larissa (Editors) ''The World of Roman Costume: Wisconsin Studies in Classics'', The University of Wisconsin Press, 1994, pp. 141-142, citing Cicero, ''In P. Vatinium testem oratio'' for the etiquette associated with the ''toga pulla''.&lt;/ref&gt; If the deceased was a male citizen, he was dressed in his toga; if he had [[Roman military decorations and punishments#Crowns|earned a wreath]] in life, he wore one in death.&lt;ref&gt;J.M.C. Toynbee, ''Death and Burial in the Roman World'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1971, 1996), pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Wreaths also are found in burials of initiates into [[mystery religions]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Minucius Felix]], ''Octavius'' 28.3–4; Mark J. Johnson, “Pagan-Christian Burial Practices of the Fourth Century: Shared Tombs?” ''Journal of Early Christian Studies'' 5 (1997), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; After the body was prepared, it lay in state in the atrium of the [[domus|family home]] (''{{lang|la|domus}}''), with the feet pointed toward the door.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, ''Death and Burial'', p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Other circumstances pertained to those who lived, as most Romans did, in [[insulae|apartment buildings]] (''{{lang|la|insulae}}''), but elite practices are better documented.

Although [[embalming]] was unusual and regarded as mainly an Egyptian practice, it is mentioned in [[Latin literature]], with a few instances documented by archaeology in Rome and throughout the Empire where no Egyptian influence can be assumed.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, ''Death and Burial'', pp. 39, 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Since elite funerals required complex arrangements, the body had to be preserved in the mean time.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, L. John, Burial Customs of the Romans, (Washington: Classical Association of the Atlantic States, 1932), 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other customs====
"[[Charon's obol]]" was a coin placed in or on the mouth&lt;ref&gt;No ancient Greek or Latin source says that coins were placed on the eyes; the archaeological evidence points overwhelming to placement in or on the mouth, in or near the hand, or loosely in the grave. Coins that could be interpreted as placement on the eyes is relatively rare.&lt;/ref&gt; of the deceased. The custom is recorded in literary sources and attested by archaeology, and sometimes occurs in contexts that suggest it may have been imported to Rome as were the mystery religions that promised initiates salvation or special passage in the afterlife. The custom was explained by the myth of [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], the ferryman who conveyed the souls of the newly dead across the water — a lake, river, or swamp — that separated the world of the living from the [[Greek underworld|underworld]]. The coin was rationalized as his payment; the satirist [[Lucian]] remarks that in order to avoid death, one should simply not pay the fee. In [[Apuleius]]'s tale of "[[Cupid and Psyche]]" in his ''[[The Golden Ass|Metamorphoses]]'', framed by Lucius's quest for salvation ending with initiation into the [[mysteries of Isis]], Psyche ("Soul") carries two coins in her [[descent to the underworld|journey to the underworld]], the second to enable her return or symbolic rebirth. Evidence of "Charon's obol" appears throughout the Western Roman Empire well into the Christian era, but at no time and place was it practiced consistently and by all.

===Disposal of the body===
[[File:Sepolcro degli Scipioni 001 Entrata.jpg|thumb| [[Tomb of the Scipios]], in use from the 3rd century BC to the 1st century AD]]
Although [[inhumation]] was practiced regularly in archaic Rome, [[cremation]] was the most common burial practice in the [[Roman Republic#Mid-Republic (274 BC - 148 BC)|Mid-]] to [[Roman Republic#Late Republic (147 BC - 30 BC)|Late Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] into the 1st and 2nd centuries. Crematory images appear in Latin poetry on the theme of the dead and mourning. In one of the best-known classical Latin poems of mourning, [[Catullus]] writes of his long journey to attend to the funeral rites of his brother, who died abroad, and expresses his grief at addressing only silent ash.&lt;ref&gt;Catullus, [[Catullus 101|''Carmen'' 101]], line 4 ''(mutam … cinerem)''.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Propertius]] describes his dead lover Cynthia visiting him in a dream, the revenant's dress is scorched down the side and the fire of the pyre has corroded the familiar ring she wears.&lt;ref&gt;Propertius 4.7.8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, [[inhumation]] would replace cremation; a variety of factors, including decreasing levels of urbanization and changes in attitudes to the [[#Afterlife|afterlife]], would contribute to this marked shift in popular burial practices. 

The care and cultivation of the dead did not end with the funeral and formal period of mourning, but was a perpetual obligation. [[Libation]]s were brought to the grave, and some tombs were even equipped with "feeding tubes" to facilitate delivery. ([[#Commemorations|See below]].)

==== Arpagi ====
The Romans referred to infants who died in the cradle as ''arpagi'' (singular ''arpagus''). The Romans did not hold funerals for ''arpagi.'' Their bodies were not cremated, or interred, and no monuments or epitaphs were made for them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0187&amp;id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&amp;isize=M|title=History of Science: Cyclopædia, or, An universal dictionary of arts and sciences: Arboreus - artery|last=|first=|date=|website=digicoll.library.wisc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, infants who had lived 40 or more days and had cut teeth before their deaths were distinguished from the ''arpagi''; they were referred to as ''rapti,'' and they were cremated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Funeral rites==
Funeral rites took place at home and at the place of burial,&lt;ref&gt;Frances Hickson Hahn, "Performing the Sacred: Prayers and Hymns," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; which was located outside the city to avoid the pollution of the living.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Salzman, "Religious ''koine'' and Religious Dissent," p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral procession ''(pompa funebris)'' transited the distance between the two.

A [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|professional guild]] (''{{lang|la|collegium}}'') of musicians specialized in funeral music.&lt;ref&gt;Friederike Fless and Katja Moede, "Music and Dance: Forms of Representation in Pictorial and Written Sources," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace]] mentions the ''[[Roman tuba|tuba]]'' and the ''[[Cornu (horn)|cornu]]'', two bronze trumpet-like instruments, at funerals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace]] ''Satire'' 1.6.45.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Laudatio|Laudatio funebris}}

===Eulogy===
{{See also|Funeral oration (ancient Greece)}}
[[File:Sarcophagus Crotone Musei Capitolini MC2783.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Fragment of a relief from a sarcophagus depicting stages of the deceased's life: religious initiation, military service, and wedding ''(mid-2nd century AD)'']]

The [[eulogy]] (''{{lang|la|laudatio funebris}}'') was a formal [[oration]] or [[panegyric]] in praise of the dead. It was one of two forms of [[discourse]] at a Roman funeral, the other being the chant (''{{lang|la|nenia}}'').&lt;ref&gt;Ann Suter, ''Lament: Studies in the Ancient Mediterranean and Beyond'' (Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is associated with [[nobiles|noble families]], and the conventions for words spoken at an ordinary person's funeral go unrecorded. While oratory was practiced in Rome only by men, an elite woman might also be honored with a eulogy.

For socially prominent individuals, the funeral procession stopped at the [[Roman Forum|forum]] for the public delivery of the eulogy from the [[Rostra]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey S. Sumi, "Power and Ritual: The Crowd at Clodius' Funeral," ''Historia'' 46.1 (1997), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a well-delivered funeral oration could be a way for a young politician to publicize himself.&lt;ref&gt;Brendon Reay, "Agriculture, Writing, and Cato's Aristocratic Self-Fashioning," ''Classical Antiquity'' 24.2 (2005), p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laudatio Iuliae amitae|Aunt Julia's Eulogy]] (''{{lang|la|Laudatio Juliae Amitae}}''), a speech made by the young [[Julius Caesar]] in honor of [[Julia (wife of Marius)|his aunt]], the widow of [[Gaius Marius]], helped launch his political career as a [[populares|populist]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerard B. Lavery, "Cicero's ''Philarchia'' and Marius," ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 18.2 (1971), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman funerals and burial#Epitaphs|epitaph]] of the deceased in effect was a digest of the eulogy made visible and permanent,&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Lewis, ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' (1993), p. 658.&lt;/ref&gt; and might include the [[cursus honorum|career]] (''[[cursus honorum]]'') of a man who had held public offices. In commemorating past deeds, the eulogy was a precursor to [[Roman historiography]].

===Sacrifices===
After the body was carried to the cemetery, a sacrifice was performed in the presence of the corpse. Until the time of [[Cicero]], it was customary to offer a sow to [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], a sow also being a characteristic offering to [[chthonic]] deities. The [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victima|sacrificial victim]] was then allotted for consumption among the participants. The portion for the deceased was put on a spit and cremated with the body. Ceres' portion was burned on an altar. The family ate the portion that was due the living. A family of lesser means offered a [[libation]] of wine, incense, produce or grain; the allocation of these offerings is not recorded.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Scheid]], "Sacrifices to Gods and Ancestors," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', pp. 264, 270.&lt;/ref&gt; After this apportioning, the deceased had transitioned and could no longer share in the meals of the living and the domestic gods; he now partook of what was appropriate for the spirits of the dead, the [[Manes]].&lt;ref&gt;Scheid, "Sacrifices to Gods and Ancestors," p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Togatus Barberini 2392.PNG|thumb|upright|left|The so-called ''[[Togatus Barberini]]'' in the [[Capitoline Museums]] may represent a senator holding two ancestral funerary portraits ''([[#Imagines|imagines]])'']]

===Novendialis===
On the ninth day after the person died, the funeral feast and rites called the ''novendialis'' or ''novemdialis'' were held.&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, "Religious ''koine'' and Religious Dissent," p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; A libation to the Manes was poured onto the grave. This concluded the period of full mourning.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, ''Death and Burial in the Roman World'', p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Mourning dress was put aside, and a feast was given.&lt;ref&gt;To wear mourning dress at the feast was considered an insult to the host, suggesting that he had somehow [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#vitium|vitiated the funeral rites]]; see Heskel, J., ''in'' Sebesta, Judith Lynn, and Bonfante, Larissa (Editors) ''The World of Roman Costume: Wisconsin Studies in Classics'', The University of Wisconsin Press, 1994, pp. 141-142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemorations==
===Festivals of the dead===
In February, the last month of the original [[Roman calendar]] when March 1 was New Year's Day, the dead were honored at a nine-day festival called the [[Parentalia]], followed by the [[Feralia]] on February 21, when the potentially malign spirits of the dead were propitiated. During the Parentalia, families gathered at cemeteries to offer meals to the ancestors, and then shared wine and cakes among themselves (compare [[veneration of the dead]] in other cultures). Tombs for wealthy, prominent families were constructed as "houses", with a decorated room for these banqueting festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Regina Gee, "From Corpse to Ancestor: The Role of Tombside Dining in the Transformation of the Body in Ancient Rome," in ''The Materiality of Death: Bodies, Burials, Beliefs'', Bar International Series 1768 (Oxford, 2008), p. 59ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epitaphs===
[[Epitaph]]s are one of the major classes of [[inscription]]s. An epitaph usually noted the person's day of birth and lifespan.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Information varies, but collectively they offer information on family relationships, political offices,&lt;ref&gt;Jack N. Lightstone, "Roman Diaspora Judaism," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; and Roman values, in choosing what aspects of the deceased's life to praise.

Philosophical beliefs may also be in evidence. The epitaphs of [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] often expressed some form of the sentiment ''non fui, fui, non sum, non desidero'', "I did not exist, I have existed, I do not exist, I feel no desire,"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 8.3463; Attilio Mastrocinque, "Creating One's Own Religion: Intellectual Choice," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''non fui, non sum, non curo'', "I did not exist, I do not exist, I'm not concerned about it."&lt;ref&gt;These became such standard sentiments that abbreviations came into inscriptional usage, for this last example ''NF NS NC''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nobiles|Noble Roman families]] often displayed a series of "images" ({{abbr|sing.|Singular}}&amp;nbsp;''{{lang|la|imago}}'', {{abbr|pl.|Latin plural}}&amp;nbsp;''{{lang|la|imagines}}'') in the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] of their [[domus|family home]]. {{refn|A supposed ''ius imaginis'' ("right of the image") has sometimes been thought to restrict this privilege to the ''[[nobiles]]'' based on a single passage by [[Cicero]],{{which|date=February 2015}} but scholars now are more likely to see the display of ancestral images as a social convention or product of affluence. See, for instance, [[Susan Walker (historian)|Walker]] and [[Andrew Burnett|Burnett]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Susan &amp;&amp;nbsp;al. ''The Image of Augustus'', p.&amp;nbsp;9. British Museum Publications, 1981. {{ISBN|0714112704}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pTZMCKs0tWUC&amp;pg=PA255|title=Death and Renewal: Volume 2: Sociological Studies in Roman History|first=Keith|last=Hopkins|date=27 June 1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=23 January 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VdVMMTGDzK4C&amp;pg=PA24|title=Roman Portraits in Context|first=Jane|last=Fejfer|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|accessdate=23 January 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} There is some uncertainty about whether these "images" were [[funeral mask]]s, [[Roman portraiture|busts]], or both together. The "images" could be arranged in a [[family tree]], with a [[Titulus (inscription)|title]] (''{{lang|la|titulus}}'') summarizing the individual's [[cursus honorum|offices held]] (''{{lang|la|honores}}'') and accomplishments (''{{lang|la|res gestae}}''),&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Lewis, "Imperial Autobiography, Augustus to Hadrian," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.34.1 (1993), p. 658.&lt;/ref&gt; a practice that might be facilitated by hanging masks.&lt;ref&gt;Rabun Taylor, "Roman Oscilla: An Assessment," ''RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics'' 48 (2005) 83–105.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, portrait busts of family members in stone or bronze were displayed in the home as well.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, "Imperial Autobiography," p. 658.&lt;/ref&gt;

Funeral masks were most likely made of wax and possibly molded as [[death mask]]s directly from the deceased. They were worn in the funeral procession either by actors who were professional mourners, or by appropriate members of the family. Practice may have varied by period or by family, since sources give no consistent account.&lt;ref&gt;Walker &amp; Burnett, pp. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

The display of ancestral images in aristocratic houses of the Republic and the public funerals are described by Pliny, Natural History 35, 4-11.&lt;ref&gt;Winkes, Rolf: Imago Clipeata, Studien zu einer römischen Bildnisform, Bonn 1969. Winkes, Rolf: Pliny's chapter on Roman funeral customs (American Journal of Archaeology 83, 1979, 481-484)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since references to "images" often fail to distinguish between commemorative portrait busts, extant examples of which are abundant, or funeral masks made of more perishable materials, none can be identified with certainty as having survived. The [[verism|veristic]] tradition of funerary likenesses, however, contributed to the development of [[realism (arts)|realistic]] [[Roman portraiture]]. In [[Roman Egypt]], the [[Fayum mummy portraits]] reflect traditions of Egyptian and Roman funerary portraiture and the techniques of Hellenistic painting.

====Sarcophagi====
{{Main|Ancient Roman sarcophagi}}

The funerary urns in which the ashes of the cremated were placed were gradually overtaken in popularity by the [[sarcophagus]] as inhumation became more common. Particularly in the 2nd–4th centuries, these were often decorated with [[relief]]s that became an important vehicle for Late [[Roman sculpture]]. The scenes depicted were drawn from [[classical mythology|mythology]], religious beliefs pertaining to the mysteries, [[allegory|allegories]], history, or scenes of hunting or feasting. Many sarcophagi depict [[Nereids]], fantastical sea creatures, and other marine imagery that may allude to the location of the [[Isles of the Blessed]] across the sea, with a portrait of the deceased on a seashell.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Strong, ''Roman Art'' (Yale University Press, 1995, 3rd edition, originally published 1976), pp. 125-126, 231.&lt;/ref&gt; The sarcophagus of a child may show tender representations of family life, [[Cupid]]s, or children playing.

[[File:Sarcophagus four seasons Musei Capitolini MC1185.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|[[Relief]] panel from a 3rd-century marble sarcophagus depicting the [[Horae|Four Seasons]] (''{{lang|la|Horae}}'') and smaller attendants around a door to the afterlife&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Barden Dowling, "A Time to Regender: The Transformation of Roman Time," in ''Time and Uncertainty'' (Brill, 2004), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Some sarcophagi may have been ordered during the person's life and custom-made to express their beliefs or aesthetics. Most were mass-produced, and if they contained a portrait of the deceased, as many did, with the face of the figure left unfinished until purchase.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, ''Roman Art'', p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;  The carved sarcophagus survived the transition to Christianity, and became the first common location for Christian sculpture, in works like the mid 4th-century [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong, ''Roman Art'', pp. 287-291&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tombs===

====Wealthy vs. Commoners====
Ancient Rome has become an excavation site known for its rather extravagant cemeteries. All in all, the commoners and wealthy families of Rome were buried in the same cemeteries; the wealthy, however, had more elaborate tombs. The tombs of the wealthy were typically cut out of bedrock and rectangular in shape.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, M. Andrea, ''Power and Its Afterlife: Tombs in Hellenistic Palestine, (Boston: The American Schools of Oriental Research,'' 2002), 138.&lt;/ref&gt; These rectangular tombs resembled the Ancient Roman's house structure, having doors, and many different chambers.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Themos, Athanasios, ''The Southwest Cemetery of Roman Sparta: A preliminary account of the results of three rescue excavations,'' (London: The British School at Athens, 2009), 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these chambers, one of them was used to hold the dead's memorial ceremony. During this ceremony, the family of the deceased would get together and have dinner. Other chambers were used to house anything thought necessary for the person laid to rest – including portraits of the deceased and any paraphernalia needed for the memorial ceremony that had yet to come.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, L. John, ''Burial Customs of the Romans,'' (Washington: Classical Association of the Atlantic States, 1932), 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wealthy and prominent families had large, sometimes enormous, [[mausoleum]]s.  The [[Castel Sant'Angelo]] by the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], originally the mausoleum of [[Hadrian]], is the best preserved, as it was converted to a fortress.&lt;ref&gt;Blagg, Thomas, in Henig, Martin (ed), ''A Handbook of Roman Art'', pp. 64-65, Phaidon, 1983, {{ISBN|0714822140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tomb of the Scipios]] was the family tomb of the [[Cornelia (gens)#Cornelii Scipiones|Scipios]], located in an aristocratic cemetery, and in use from the 3rd century BC to the 1st century AD. A grand mausoleum might include bedrooms and kitchens for family visits which would include feasts.  For the wealthy middle class, smaller mausolea lined the roads from cities, many of which still remain in the [[Tombs of Via Latina]], along the [[Appian Way]], and elsewhere.  The [[Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker]] is a famous and originally very ostentatious tomb in a prime spot just outside the [[Porta Maggiore]], erected for a rich [[freedman]] baker around 50-20 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, ''Roman Art'', p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; The tombs at [[Petra]], in the far east of the Empire are cut into cliffs, some with elaborate facades in the "baroque" style of the Imperial period.  The less wealthy made do with smaller tombs, often featuring [[relief]] busts over a lengthy inscription.  Cheaper still were the [[Catacombs of Rome]], famously used by Christians, but also by all religions, with some specialization, such as special Jewish sections.  These were large systems of narrow tunnels in the soft rock below Rome, where niches were sold to the families of the deceased in a very profitable, if rather smelly, trade.  Decoration included paintings, many of which have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, ''Roman Art'', pp. 291-296&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior of the tomb resembled that of a garden. Beautiful flowers and plants decked the outside of the tombs and made them more flattering to the eye. This was probably were the tradition of bringing flowers to a loved one’s grave site began. Other items were also added to the outside of the wealthy’s tombs to make it more decorative. The burial chamber of the deceased was above ground and stocked with relics that were important to the deceased Roman.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Lack of relics found in excavated tombs was most probably due to grave robbing.

In the Christian period, it became desirable to be buried near the grave of a famous [[martyr]], and large funeral halls were opened over such graves, which were often in a catacomb underneath.  These contained rows of tombs, but also space for meals for the family, now probably to be seen as [[agape feast]]s.  Many of the large Roman churches began as funeral halls, which were originally private enterprises; the family of [[Constantine I|Constantine]] owned the one over the grave of Saint [[Agnes of Rome]], whose ruins are next to [[Santa Costanza]], originally a Constantinian family mausoleum forming an [[apse]] to the hall.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Matilda. [https://books.google.com/books?id=hUN1K78QMskC&amp;pg=PA249 ''The churches and catacombs of early Christian Rome: a comprehensive guide'', pp. 249-252].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blagg, ''Handbook'', p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military funerals and burial==
[[File:Gravestone Reburrus Xanten 230.jpg|thumb|Tombstone of a [[auxilia|Germanic cavalryman]] (1st century AD, [[Xanten]])]]
"The cult of the dead," it has been noted,&lt;ref&gt;[[Yann Le Bohec]], ''The Imperial Roman Army'' (Routledge, 2001, originally published 1989 in French), p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; "was particularly important to men whose profession exposed them to a premature demise." The Roman value of ''pietas'' encompassed the desire of soldiers to honor their fallen comrades, though the conditions of war might interfere with the timely performance of traditional rites.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Bohec, ''The Imperial Roman Army'', p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers killed in battle on foreign soil with ongoing hostilities were probably given a mass cremation or burial.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Toynbee, ''Death and Burial'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Under less urgent circumstances, they might be cremated individually, and their ashes placed in a vessel for transport to a permanent burial site.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army of the First and Second Centuries A.D.'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1985, 1998, 3rd edition), pp. 280–281.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Roman army]] under the command of [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] suffered their disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|Battle of Teutoburg Forest]] in 9 AD, they remained uncommemorated until [[Germanicus]] and his troops located the battlefield a few years later and made a funeral mound for their remains.&lt;ref&gt;Pat Southern, ''The Roman Army: A Social and Institutional History'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the permanent garrisons of the Empire, a portion of each soldier's pay was set aside and pooled for funeral expenses, including the ritual meal, the burial, and commemoration.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', pp. 267, 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers who died of illness or an accident during the normal routines of life would have been given the same rites as in civilian life.&lt;ref&gt;Le Bohec, ''The Imperial Roman Army,''  p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; The first burial clubs for soldiers were formed under [[Augustus]]; [[burial society|burial societies]] had existed for civilians long before. Veterans might pay into a fund upon leaving the service, insuring a decent burial by membership in [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sodalitas|an association]] for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Le Bohec, ''The Imperial Roman Army'', p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tombstones and monuments throughout the Empire document military personnel and units stationed at particular camps ''([[castra]])''. If the body could not be recovered, the death could be commemorated with a [[cenotaph]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Epitaphs on [[Roman military tombstones]] usually give the soldier's name, his birthplace, rank and unit, age and years of service, and sometimes other information such as the names of his heirs. Some more elaborate monuments depict the deceased, either in his parade regalia&lt;ref&gt;Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p.280.&lt;/ref&gt; or in civilian dress to emphasize his citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Le Bohec, ''The Imperial Roman Army'', p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman cavalry|Cavalrymen]] are often shown riding over the body of a downtrodden foe, an image interpreted as a symbolic victory over death.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Military funeral monuments from [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]] take progressively more substantial forms: [[stele]]s in the 1st century, altars in the 2nd, and cupulas (mounds) in the 3rd. Tombs were often grouped in military cemeteries along the roads that led out of the camp. A [[centurion]] might be well-off enough to have a [[mausoleum]] built.&lt;ref&gt;Bohec, ''The Imperial Roman Army'', p.251.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a commander was killed in action, the men rode or marched around his pyre, or in some circumstances a cenotaph.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

The [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]] continued under Rome and seem to have promised immortality only for the initiated. Known forms of esoteric religion combined Roman, [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]], and [[Mesopotamian mythology|Middle Eastern mythology]] and [[astrology]], describing the progress of its initiates through the regions of the moon, sun, and stars. The uninitiated or virtueless were then left behind, the underworld becoming solely a place of torment. Common depictions of the afterlife of the bless include rest, a celestial banquet, and the vision of [[God]] (''{{lang|la|Deus}}'' or [[Jupiter]]).&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

===Philosophy===
{{main|Roman philosophy}}
The mainstream of [[Roman philosophy]], such as the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], advocated contemplation and acceptance of the inevitability of death of all mortals. "It is necessary for some to stay and for others to go, all the while rejoicing with those who are with us, yet not grieving for those departing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Epictetus]], ''Disc.'', III.xxiv.11.&lt;/ref&gt; To grieve bitterly is to fail to perceive and accept the nature of things. Famously, [[Epictetus]] encouraged contemplation of one's loved ones as a "jar" or "crystal cup" which might break and be remembered without troubling the spirit, since "you love a mortal, something not your own. It has been given to you for the present, not inseparably nor forever, but like a fig... at a fixed season of the year. If you yearn for it in the winter, you are a fool."&lt;ref&gt;[[Epictetus]], ''Disc.'', III.xxiv.84–87.&lt;/ref&gt;
There was no real consensus, at least among surviving Roman texts and epitaphs, of what happened to a person after death or the existence of an afterlife. [[Pliny the Elder]] in his [[Naturalis Historia]] claims that most people are of the opinion that after death one returns to the non-sensing state that occurred before birth but admits, however scornfully, that there are people who believe in the immortality of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Post sepulturam vanae manium ambages, omnibus a supremo die eadem quae ante primum, nec magis a morte sensus ullus aut corpori aut animae quam ante natalem. eadem enim vanitas in futurum etiam se propagat et in mortis quoque tempora ipsa sibi vitam mentitur, alias inmortalitatem animae, alias transfigurationem – VII.188&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the Younger]] seems to be less consistent, arguing both sides, indicating that death brings about utter annihilation while also talking about some survival of the spirit after it escapes from the prison of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Motto, A. L. (1995, January). Seneca on Death and Immortality. The Classical Journal, 50(4), 187-189.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tacitus]] at the end of Agricola takes the opposite opinion to Pliny, and claims that the wise believe the spirit does not die with the body, although he may be specifically referring to the pious &lt;ref&gt;Si quis piorum minibus locus, si, ut sapientibus placet, non cum corpore extiguuntur magnae animae - XLVI&lt;/ref&gt;  – which harkens to the mythological idea of [[Elysium]]. It is important to keep in mind that these are the opinions of a select few well-educated elite males and may not be characteristic of all of Roman views.

[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Man of Sorrows with Hands Bound - WGA7346.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''[[Man of sorrows|Schmerzensmann]]'', [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]
'''Scapegoating''' is the practice of singling out a person or group for unmerited [[blame]] and consequent negative treatment. Scapegoating may be conducted by individuals against individuals (e.g. "he did it, not me!"), individuals against groups (e.g., "I couldn't see anything because of all the tall people"), groups against individuals (e.g., "Jane was the reason our team didn't win"), and groups against groups.

A [[scapegoat]] may be an adult, child, sibling, employee, peer, ethnic, political or religious group, or country. A [[whipping boy]], [[identified patient]] or "[[fall guy]]" are forms of scapegoat.

==At the individual level==

A medical definition of scapegoating is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?scapegoating |title=scapegoating - Definition |publisher=Mondofacto.com |date=1998-12-12 |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Process in which the mechanisms of [[Psychological projection|projection]] or [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]] are utilized in focusing feelings of [[aggression]], [[hostility]], [[frustration]], etc., upon another individual or group; the amount of [[blame]] being unwarranted." Scapegoating is a hostile tactic often employed to characterize an entire group of individuals according to the unethical or immoral conduct of a small number of individuals belonging to that group. Scapegoating relates to [[guilt by association]] and [[stereotyping]].

Scapegoated groups throughout history have included almost every imaginable group of people: genders, religions, people of different races, nations, or sexual orientations, people with different political beliefs, or people differing in behaviour from the majority. However, scapegoating may also be applied to organizations, such as governments, corporations, or various political groups.

===Its archetype===
Jungian analysist [[Sylvia Brinton Perera]] situates its mythology of [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] and [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]].&lt;ref&gt;Perera, ''The Scapegoat Complex'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals experience it at the [[Jungian archetype|archetypal]] level. As an ancient social process to rid a community of its past evil deeds and reconnect it to the sacred realm, the [[scapegoat]] appeared in a biblical rite,&lt;ref&gt;[[Acharei Mot|Book of ''Leviticus'', Chapter 16]], per the holy day of [[Yom Kippur]].&lt;/ref&gt; which involved two goats and the pre-Judaic, [[chthonic]] god [[Azazel]].&lt;ref&gt;Perera (1986), p.17: the Hebrews "later considered Azazel a fallen angel". Perera at p.112 n.28, citing to [[Louis Ginzberg]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern scapegoat complex, however, "the energy field has been radically broken apart" and the libido "split off from consciousness". Azazel's role is deformed into an accuser of the scapegoated victim.&lt;ref&gt;Perera (1986), p.18 (two quotes re modern secular culture, Azazel's role debased).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Blame for breaking a perfectionist moral code, for instance, might be measured out by aggressive scapegoaters. Themselves often wounded, the scapegoaters can be sadistic, [[superego]] accusers with brittle [[Persona (psychology)|persona]]s, who have driven their own shadows [[Unconscious mind|underground]] from where such are [[Psychological projection|projected]] onto the victim. The scapegoated victim may then live in a hell of felt unworthiness, retreating from consciousness, burdened by shadow and transpersonal guilt,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[C. G. Jung]], "A psychological view of conscience" in his ''Collected Works'' (Princeton: Bollingen 1953-1979), vol. 10, cited by Perera (1986), re pp. 11-12 n.8, 14 n.21, 33 n.45.&lt;/ref&gt; and hiding from the pain of self-understanding. [[Psychotherapy|Therapy]] includes modeling self-protective skills for the victim's battered ego, and guidance in the search for inner integrity, to find the victim's own [[voice]].&lt;ref&gt;Perera (1986): archetype (pp. 9-10, 16, 18, 48-49, 73, 77, 83, 98); ancient rite (pp. 8, 11-25, two goats 16-17, 88-97); modern complex (18-29, 30, 98, quotes at 18); accusers (9, 18-21, blames victim 20, superego 21, 28-29, 30-33, shadow 30, projected 31, also wounded 32, 55); victims (11-12, 15-16, hiding 24, 26-28, hell 26, ego 28, 33, 34-35, 43-72, burden 98); within families (30-33, 35, 53-54, 73, 76, 99); therapy (18, 22, 24-25, 26-29, voice 29, 33, 41-43, 47, 69-72, 86-97).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Projection===
{{Main article|Psychological projection}}
Unwanted thoughts and feelings can be unconsciously projected onto another who becomes a scapegoat for one's own problems. This concept can be extended to projection by groups. In this case the chosen individual, or group, becomes the scapegoat for the group's problems. "Political agitation in all countries is full of such projections, just as much as the backyard gossip of little groups and individuals."&lt;ref&gt;M.-L. von Franz, in C. G. Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1964) p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]] considered indeed that "there must be some people who behave in the wrong way; they act as scapegoats and objects of interest for the normal ones".&lt;ref&gt;C. G Jung, ''Analytical Psychology'' (London 1976) p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scapegoat theory of intergroup conflict&lt;!--'Scapegoat theory of intergroup conflict' redirects here--&gt;==

The '''scapegoat theory of intergroup conflict'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; provides an explanation for the correlation between times of relative economic despair and increases in prejudice and violence toward [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poppe|first=Edwin|title=Effects of changes in GNP and perceived group characteristics on national and ethnic stereotypes in central and eastern Europe.|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|year=2001|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1689–1708|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2001.tb02746.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of [[Anti-black racism|anti-black]] violence ([[racist]] violence) in the southern United States between 1882 and 1930 show a correlation between poor economic conditions and outbreaks of violence (e.g., lynchings) against blacks. The correlation between the price of cotton (the principal product of the area at that time) and the number of lynchings of black men by whites ranged from -0.63 to -0.72, suggesting that a poor economy induced white people to take out their frustrations by attacking an outgroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hovland|first=C. I.|last2=Sears| first2=R. R. |title=Minor studies of aggression: VI. Correlation of lynchings with economic indices|journal=Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied|year=1940|volume=9|issue=2|pages=301–310|doi=10.1080/00223980.1940.9917696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scapegoating as a group necessitates that [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]] members settle on one specific target to blame for their problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1002/9780470773963.ch15|chapter=Choice of Scapegoats|title=On the Nature of Prejudice: Fifty Years after Allport|pages=244–261|year=2005|last1=Glick|first1=Peter|isbn=9780470773963|editor-last1=Dovidio|editor-first1=John F.|editor-last2=Glick|editor-first2=Peter|editor-last3=Rudman|editor-first3=Laurie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDSyHPt98E0C&amp;pg=PA244|publisher=Blackwell Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scapegoating is also more likely to appear when a group has experienced difficult, prolonged negative experiences (as opposed to minor annoyances). When negative conditions frustrate a group's attempts at successful acquisition of its most essential needs (e.g., food, shelter), groups develop a compelling, shared ideology that - when combined with social and political pressures - may lead to the most extreme form of scapegoating: [[genocide]].

Scapegoating can also cause oppressed groups to lash out at other oppressed groups. Even when injustices are committed against a minority group by the majority group, minorities sometimes lash out against a different [[minority group]] in lieu of confronting the more powerful majority.

In management, scapegoating is a known practice in which a lower staff employee is blamed for the mistakes of senior executives. This is often due to lack of [[accountability]] in upper management.&lt;ref name="it-scapegoat"&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/the-art-of-scapegoating-in-it-projects The Art of Scapegoating in IT Projects] PM Hut, 15 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scapegoat mechanism&lt;!--'Scapegoat theory of intergroup conflict' redirects here--&gt;==

Literary critic and philosopher [[Kenneth Burke]] first coined and described the expression '''scapegoat mechanism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; in his books ''Permanence and Change'' (1935),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=99056219|title=Permanence and Change: An Anatomy of Purpose - 1935 by Kenneth Burke. 99056219 - Online Research Library: Questia|website=www.questia.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Grammar of Motives'' (1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=72433755|title=A Grammar of Motives - 1945, Page iii by Kenneth Burke. - Online Research Library: Questia|website=www.questia.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These works influenced some [[philosophical anthropology|philosophical anthropologists]], such as [[Ernest Becker]] and [[René Girard]]. Girard developed the concept much more extensively as an interpretation of human culture. In Girard's view, it is humankind, not God, who has need for various forms of atoning violence. Humans are driven by desire for that which another has or wants ([[mimetic desire]]). This causes a triangulation of desire and results in conflict between the desiring parties. This mimetic ''contagion'' increases to a point where society is at risk; it is at this point that the ''scapegoat mechanism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dumont.typepad.com/publications/Mimesis_Jean-Baptiste_Dumont.pdf Mimesis - The Scapegoat Model], Jean-Baptiste Dumont&lt;/ref&gt; is triggered. This is the point where one person is singled out as the cause of the trouble and is expelled or killed by the group. This person is the scapegoat. Social order is restored as people are contented that they have solved the cause of their problems by removing the scapegoated individual, and the cycle begins again. The keyword here is "content". Scapegoating serves as a psychological relief for a group of people. Girard contends that this is what happened in the narrative of [[Jesus]] of Nazareth, the central figure in Christianity. The difference between the scapegoating of Jesus and others, Girard believes, is that in the [[resurrection of Jesus]] from the dead, he is shown to be an innocent victim; humanity is thus made aware of its violent tendencies and the cycle is broken.  Thus Girard's work is significant as a reconstruction of the ''[[Christus Victor]]'' [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] theory.

The '''sterile fungi''', or ''mycelia sterilia'' are a group of [[fungi]] that do not produce any known [[spores]], either [[sex]]ual or [[asexual reproduction|asexual]]. This is considered a form group, not a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic division]], and is used as a matter of convenience. Because these fungi do not produce spores, it is impossible to use traditional methods of [[morphology (biology)|morphological comparison]] to classify them. However, [[molecular]] techniques can be applied to determine their [[evolution|evolutionary history]].

== History ==
The fox died of natural causes. It was stuffed in 2012 by [[Wales|Welsh]] artist [[Adele Morse]] (originally from [[Blackwood, Caerphilly]], now based in [[Dalston]], East London), who at the time was taking a Masters course at the [[Royal Academy of London]] and made it as part of a school project. The results weren't good. She put the finished work on eBay where it surprisingly gained lots of attention.&lt;ref name="Mail Online 2013-03-11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crappy Taxidermy 2014-06-30"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crappytaxidermy.com/post/90420823835/interview-with-adele-morse-creator-of-stoner-fox|title=Interview with Adele Morse, creator of Stoner Fox|work=Crappy Taxidermy|date=2014-06-30|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wales Online 2012-12-09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC Radio National (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) 2016-05-27"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/radiotonic/deadfox/7448326|title=The Adventures of a Dead Fox - Radiotonic|publisher=ABC Radio National (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)|date=2016-05-27|accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet meme ==
At the end of 2012 in [[Russia]] the fox quickly became an [[Internet meme]]. It is edited into famous paintings, photographs, videos, and other visual media.&lt;ref name="Mail Online 2013-03-11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPost UK 2013-04-04" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18278">'''Technosignature''' or '''technomarker''' is any measurable property or effect that provides [[scientific evidence]] of past or present technology.&lt;ref name="tarter-2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UT-2018" /&gt;
Technosignatures are analogous to the [[biosignatures]] that signal the presence of life, whether or not intelligent.&lt;ref name=tarter-2018 /&gt;  Some authors prefer to exclude radio transmissions from the definition,&lt;ref name=almar-2011&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2011.05.036|author=Almár, Iván|volume=69|date=2011|pages=899–904|title=SETI and astrobiology: The Rio Scale and the London Scale|journal=Acta Astronautica|issue=9–10|bibcode = 2011AcAau..69..899A }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; but such restrictive usage is not widespread.
[[Jill Tarter]] has proposed that the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI) be renamed "the search for technosignatures".&lt;ref name="tarter-2018" /&gt;
Various types of technosignatures, such as [[radiation leakage]] from [[megascale engineering|megascale]] [[astroengineering]] installations such as [[Dyson sphere]]s, the light from an extraterrestrial [[ecumenopolis]], or [[Shkadov thrusters]] with the power to alter the orbits of stars around the [[Galactic Center]], may be detectable with [[hypertelescope]]s.  Some examples of technosignatures are described in [[Paul Davies]]'s 2010 book ''[[The Eerie Silence]]'', although the terms "technosignature" and "technomarker" do not appear in the book.

==Astroengineering projects==
A Dyson sphere, constructed by life forms dwelling in proximity to a [[Solar analog|Sun-like star]], would cause an increase in the amount of infrared radiation in the star system's emitted spectrum. Hence, [[Freeman Dyson]] selected the title "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation" for his 1960 paper on the subject.&lt;ref name="search"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date= 1960|url=http://www.islandone.org/LEOBiblio/SETI1.HTM|title=Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation|author= Freemann J.

From 2005, [[Fermilab]] has conducted an ongoing survey for such spectra, analyzing data from the [[Infrared Astronomical Satellite]].&lt;ref name=carrigan&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| title=Fermilab Dyson Sphere search program| date=2006| accessdate=2006-03-02| first=Dick| last=Carrigan| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306222359/http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| archivedate=2006-03-06| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shostak |first=Seth |date=Spring 2009 |journal=Engineering &amp; Science |title=When Will We Find the Extraterrestrials? |volume=72 |pages=12–21 |issn=0013-7812 |url=http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf &lt;!-- permalink to official source with abstract &amp; alternate PDF link: http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechES:72.1.Extraterrestrials --&gt; |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415115307/http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identifying one of the many infra-red sources as a Dyson sphere would require improved techniques for discriminating between a Dyson sphere and natural sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Dyson_sphere |title='&amp;#39;Dyson sphere'&amp;#39; at Scholarpedia |publisher=Scholarpedia.org |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermilab discovered 17 "ambiguous" candidates, of which four have been named "amusing but still questionable".&lt;ref name="Carrigan 2012"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| title=Fermilab Dyson Sphere search program| date=2012| accessdate=2012-01-15| first=D.| last=Carrigan| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306222359/http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| archivedate=2006-03-06| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other searches also resulted in several candidates, which remain unconfirmed.&lt;ref name=carrigan /&gt; In October 2012, astronomer [[Geoff Marcy]], one of the pioneers of the search for [[extrasolar planets]], was given a research grant to search data from the ''[[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]'' telescope, with the aim of detecting possible signs of Dyson spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanders |first=Robert |url=http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2012/10/05/grants-help-scientists-explore-border-between-science-science-fiction/ |title=Grants help scientists explore boundary between science &amp; science fiction |publisher=Newscenter.berkeley.edu |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shkadov thrusters, with the hypothetical ability to change the orbital paths of stars in order to avoid various dangers to life such as [[molecular cloud|cold molecular cloud]]s or [[impact event|cometary impact]]s, would also be detectable in a similar fashion to the [[transit method|transiting]] extrasolar planets searched by ''Kepler''. Unlike planets, though, the thrusters would appear to abruptly stop over the surface of a star rather than crossing it completely, revealing their technological origin.&lt;ref name=Villard2013&gt;{{Cite web | title = Alien 'Star Engine' Detectable in Exoplanet Data? | url = http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/planet-searches-might-stumble-across-an-alien-stellar-engine-130625.htm | date = 2013 | author = Villard, Ray | accessdate = 2013-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, evidence of targeted extrasolar [[asteroid mining]] may also reveal extraterrestrial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1103.5369|author1=Duncan Forgan|author2=Martin Elvis|title=Extrasolar Asteroid Mining as Forensic Evidence for Extraterrestrial Intelligence|date=2011|doi=10.1017/S1473550411000127|volume=10|issue=4|journal=International Journal of Astrobiology|pages=307–313|bibcode=2011IJAsB..10..307F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planetary analysis==

===Artificial heat and light===
Various astronomers, including [[Avi Loeb]] of the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] and [[Edwin Turner]] of [[Princeton University]] have proposed that artificial light from extraterrestrial planets, such as that originating from cities, industries, and transport networks, could be detected and signal the presence of an advanced civilization. Such approaches, though, make the assumption that the radiant energy generated by civilization would be relatively clustered and can therefore be detected easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2011/11/03/SETI-search-urged-to-look-for-city-lights/UPI-89301320361336/#ixzz2HRkOcctY |title=SETI search urged to look for city lights |publisher=UPI.com |date=2011-11-03 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Extrasolar Planets: Formation, Detection and Dynamics Rudolf Dvorak, page 14 John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Light and heat detected from planets must be distinguished from natural sources to conclusively prove the existence of intelligent life on a planet.&lt;ref name=almar-2011 /&gt; For example, NASA's 2012 ''Black Marble'' experiment showed that significant stable light and heat sources on Earth, such as chronic wildfires in arid [[Western Australia]], originate from uninhabited areas and are naturally occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/news/aus-fires.html |title=Wildfires Light Up Western Australia |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2012-12-07 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atmospheric analysis===
Atmospheric analysis of planetary atmospheres, as is already done on various Solar System bodies and in a rudimentary fashion on several [[hot Jupiter]] extrasolar planets, may reveal the presence of chemicals produced by technological civilizations.&lt;ref name=choi-2012 /&gt; For example, atmospheric emissions from industry on Earth, including [[nitrogen dioxide]] and [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s, are detectable from space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Satellite_sniffs_out_chemical_traces_of_atmospheric_pollution |title=Satellite sniffs out chemical traces of atmospheric pollution / Observing the Earth / Our Activities / ESA |publisher=Esa.int |date=2000-12-18 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artificial pollution may therefore be detectable on extrasolar planets. However, there remains a possibility of mis-detection; for example, the [[atmosphere of Titan]] has detectable signatures of complex chemicals that are similar to what on Earth are industrial pollutants, though obviously not the byproduct of civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/21470-saturn-moon-titan-haze-cassini.html |title=Haze on Saturn's Moon Titan Is Similar to Earth's Pollution |publisher=Space.com |date=2013-06-06 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some SETI scientists have proposed searching for artificial atmospheres created by planetary engineering to produce habitable environments for colonisation by an ETI.&lt;ref name=choi-2012&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.space.com/18624-alien-life-search-hairspray.html |title=Alien Hairspray May Help Us Find E.T. |publisher=Space.com |date=2012-11-26 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraterrestrial artifacts and spacecraft==
{{see also|Potential cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact#Extraterrestrial artifacts}}

=== Spacecraft ===
[[Interstellar spacecraft]] may be detectable from hundreds to thousands of [[light-year]]s away through various forms of radiation, such as the [[photon]]s emitted by an [[antimatter rocket]] or [[cyclotron radiation]] from the interaction of a magnetic sail with the [[interstellar medium]]. Such a signal would be easily distinguishable from a natural signal and could hence firmly establish the existence of extraterrestrial life were it to be detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=Detection of Extraterrestrial Civilizations via the Spectral Signature of Advanced Interstellar Spacecraft | publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific | author=Zubrin, Robert | editor=Shostak, Seth | booktitle=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series | date=1995 | conference=Progress in the Search for Extraterrestrial Life | pages=487–496 | bibcode=1995ASPC...74..487Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, smaller [[Bracewell probe]]s within the Solar System itself may also be detectable by means of optical or radio searches.&lt;ref name=freitas-1983&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|title=The Case for Interstellar Probes|volume=36|date=November 1983|pages=490–495|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/TheCaseForInterstellarProbes1983.htm|author=Freitas, Robert|bibcode = 1983JBIS...36..490F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tough-1998-2&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|title=Small Smart Interstellar Probes|author=Tough, Allen|volume=51|pages=167–174|date=1998
|url=http://www.ieti.org/tough/articles/jbis51.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Satellites ===
A less advanced technology, and one closer to humanity's current technological level, is the Clarke Exobelt proposed by Astrophysicist Hector Socas-Navarro of the [[Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dorminey |first1=Bruce |title=NASA's TESS Telescope May Spot Alien Geo-Satellites, Say Astronomers |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2018/02/24/nasas-tess-telescope-could-detect-belt-of-alien-geo-satellites-says-new-paper/#36256f8e4eb4 |website=Forbes |accessdate=12 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothetical belt would be formed by all the artificial [[satellite]]s occupying [[geostationary]]/[[geosynchronous]] orbits around an [[exoplanet]]. Simulations suggest that a very dense satellite belt (requiring only a moderately more-advanced civilization than ours) would be detectable with existing technology in the [[Light curve|light curves]] from [[Methods of detecting exoplanets#Transit photometry|transiting]] exoplanets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Possible Photometric Signatures of Moderately Advanced Civilizations: The Clarke Exobelt|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=855|issue=2|pages=110|arxiv=1802.07723|author=Hector Socas-Navarro|date=2018-02-21|doi=10.3847/1538-4357/aaae66|bibcode=2018ApJ...855..110S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific projects searching for technosignatures==
One of the first attempts to search for Dyson Spheres was made by Vyacheslav Slysh from the Space Research Institute in Moscow in 1985 using data from the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS)]].&lt;ref&gt;Alien megaprojects: The hunt has begun New Scientist 09 April 2013 by Stephen Battersby&lt;/ref&gt;

Another search for technosignatures, circa 2001, involved an analysis of data from the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] for traces of anti-matter, which, besides one "intriguing spectrum probably not related to SETI", came up empty.&lt;ref name="harris-2001" /&gt;

In 2005, [[Fermilab]] had an ongoing survey for such spectra by analyzing data from IRAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| title=Fermilab Dyson Sphere search program| date=2006| accessdate=2006-03-02| first=D.| last=Carrigan| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306222359/http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| archivedate=2006-03-06| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shostak |first=Seth |date=Spring 2009 |journal=Engineering &amp; Science |title=When Will We Find the Extraterrestrials? |volume=72 |number=1 |pages=12–21 |issn=0013-7812 |url=http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf &lt;!-- permalink to official source with abstract &amp; alternate PDF link: http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechES:72.1.Extraterrestrials --&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415115307/http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying one of the many infra-red sources as a Dyson Sphere would require improved techniques for discriminating between a Dyson Sphere and natural sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Dyson_sphere ''Dyson sphere'' at Scholarpedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Fermilab discovered 17 potential "ambiguous" candidates of which four have been named "amusing but still questionable".&lt;ref name="Carrigan 2012"/&gt; Other searches also resulted in several candidates, which are, however, unconfirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dick Carrigan |url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/infrared_astronomy/Other_searches.htm |title=Dyson Sphere Searches |publisher=Home.fnal.gov |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 paper, Luc Arnold proposed a means of detecting planetary-sized artifacts from their distinctive transit light curve signature. He showed that such technosignature was within the reach of space missions aimed at detecting exoplanets by the [[transit method]], as were ''Corot'' or ''Kepler'' projects at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Luc F. A. Arnold, 2005, Transit Light-Curve Signatures of Artificial Objects http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/abs/2005ApJ...627..534A&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of the detection remains applicable for the future exoplanets missions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite TESS.] NASA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CHEOPS CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite http://cheops.unibe.ch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sci.esa.int/plato/ PLATO PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars]. ESA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a trio of astronomers led by Jason Wright started a two-year search for Dyson Spheres, aided by grants from the [[Templeton Foundation]].&lt;ref name="UT-2013" /&gt;

In 2013, Geoff Marcy received funding to use data from the [[Kepler Telescope]] to search for Dyson Spheres and interstellar communication using lasers,&lt;ref name="SMH-2013" /&gt; and [[Lucianne Walkowicz]] received funding to detect artificial signatures in stellar photometry.[https://web.archive.org/web/20131022101358/http://scienceblogs.com/catdynamics/2012/10/04/new-frontiers-in-astronomy-the-research-grant-winners/]

Starting in 2016, astronomer [[Jean-Luc Margot]] of [[UCLA]] has been searching for technosignatures with large radio telescopes.&lt;ref name="UT-2018" /&gt;

==Description==
Troglodytes are described as being shorter than a [[Human (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|human]], with spindly but muscular arms and squat legs. It also has some [[lizardfolk|lizardman]]-like traits with a reptilian head and forearms, a spinal crest, and a long, slender tail.

A troglodyte is usually [[Alignment (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)#Chaotic Evil|chaotic evil]] in alignment; they are considered mostly hostile towards humans and other races.

Troglodytes primarily worship their patron, a disgusting toad-lizard called [[Laogzed]]. Some worship [[Ogrémoch]], prince of evil earth creatures. In ancient times, many worshiped [[Demogorgon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Demogorgon]].

Troglodytes carry a repulsive odor which causes harm to those around them.

The spoken troglodyte language is apparently derived from a simplified version of the [[lizardfolk]] tongue, but this is accompanied by a vast, full vocabulary consisting of smells generated by troglodyte scent glands. This olfactory language was apparently their original means of communication, and they adopted words from the lizardfolk dialect of Draconic purely to make themselves comprehensible to outsiders. Their olfactory language takes precedence over all others.

Troglodytes are fairly intelligent. They are not as intelligent as most humans, but their fear towards their deities allows them to be easily fooled. Showing god-like power, saving them from harm, or offering them shiny objects has a chance of taming them. Troglodytes do not enjoy captivity and can generally be influenced to become a companion by releasing them.

==Campaign settings==

===Greyhawk===
Thousands of years in the past, the ancestors of the troglodytes dominated much of the [[Oerth]] before they were struck mad by the demon gods they worshiped. Some few secluded groups managed to hold on to some vestige of their civilization. Near modern [[Irongate (Greyhawk)|Irongate]], a group dominated the local [[Flan (Greyhawk)|Flan]] tribes until the rise of the Flan kingdom of [[Ahlissa]], when the Hradikar warriors of that land threatened the reptiles' rule. Rather than confronting the humans directly, the troglodytes put themselves into a magical sleep.

====Descent into the Depths of the Earth====
A band of troglodytes serving a [[Lich (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|lich]] are featured in the 1978 module ''[[Descent into the Depths of the Earth]]'', as well as in the 2000 novelization, written by [[Paul Kidd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kidd|first1=Paul|title=[[Descent into the Depths of the Earth]]|date=2000|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|isbn=0786916354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''D&amp;D'' Miniatures==
The troglodyte is featured in the ''D&amp;D'' Miniatures: Dragoneye set #60 (2004).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1459">'''Walter IV of Enghien''' (died 1381), [[County of Hainaut|Hainault]] nobleman and soldier, was the son of [[Sohier of Enghien]]. He was [[Count of Brienne]] as '''Walter VII''' and Lord of Enghien in 1364–1381.

Appointed Marshal of Flanders by [[Louis II of Flanders]], he energetically prosecuted the war against the rebellious [[Ghent]]ois. He is notorious for his sack of the city of [[Geraardsbergen]] on July 7, 1381, wherein his troops burned and destroyed the town, killing many of its inhabitants.

Rejoining the Flemish army besieging Ghent, he and a handful of companions were trapped by an ambush laid by the Ghentois, perhaps composed of survivors of Geraardsbergen. He and his illegitimate half-brother John were both cut down in the fighting.

He was succeeded by his heir in [[proximity of blood]], his uncle [[Louis of Enghien]].

Kapitänleutnant '''Walther Schwieger''' (7 April 1885 – 5 September 1917) was a [[U-boat]] [[commander]] in the [[Imperial German Navy]] (''Kaiserliche Marine'') during [[First World War]]. In 1915, he sank the passenger liner {{RMS|Lusitania}} with the loss of 1,198 lives.

==Military career==
[[File:Schwieger gruppe 1906.jpg|thumb|left|Schwieger (''bottom right'') in a 1906 group photograph of torpedo division students]]
In 1903 he joined the Imperial German Navy and from 1911 onwards he served with the U-boat Service. In 1912 he took over the command of the {{SMU|U-14|Germany|2}}. After the outbreak of World War I in 1914 he was promoted to ''[[Captain lieutenant#Germany and other European navies|Kapitänleutnant]]'' and given command of the {{SMU|U-20|Germany|2}}.

On 7 May 1915, Schwieger was responsible for ''U-20's'' sinking passenger liner {{RMS|Lusitania}} leading to the deaths of 1,198 people, an event that played a role in the United States' later entry into [[World War I]]. He also torpedoed [[Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers|SS ''Hesperian'']] on 4 September and {{SS|Cymric}} on 8 May 1916. On 31 May 1917, his U-boat {{SMU|U-88||2}} sank the ''[[Miyazaki Maru]]'' during that ship's voyage from Yokohama to London, causing the loss of eight lives.

Schwieger was [[killed in action]] on 5 September 1917. His U-boat {{SMU|U-88||2}} hit a British mine while being chased by {{HMS|Stonecrop}}. It sank north of [[Terschelling]] at {{nowrap|{{coord|53|57|N|4|55|E|scale:5000000|display=title, inline}}}} with a loss of all hands.

During his wartime career, Schwieger captained three different submarines, on a total of 34 missions. He sank 49 ships, measuring {{GRT|183883|disp=long}}. He was the [[List of successful U-boat commanders|sixth most successful submarine commander]] of [[World War I]].

==Plot==
Maya is a U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] analyst tasked with finding the [[al-Qaeda]] leader [[Osama bin Laden]]. In 2003 she is stationed at the [[Embassy of the United States, Islamabad|U.S. embassy in Pakistan]]. She and officer Dan attend the [[black site]] interrogations of [[Ammar al-Baluchi|Ammar]], a detainee with suspected links to several of the 2001 [[hijackers in the September 11 attacks]] who is subjected to [[Enhanced interrogation techniques|approved torture interrogation techniques]]. Ammar provides unreliable information on a suspected attack in [[Saudi Arabia]], but reveals to Maya the name of the personal courier for bin Laden, [[Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti]]. Other detainee intelligence connects courier traffic by Abu Ahmed between [[Abu Faraj al-Libbi]] (Yoav Levi) and bin Laden. In 2005, Faraj denies knowing about a courier named Abu Ahmed; Maya interprets this as an attempt by Faraj to conceal the importance of Abu Ahmed.

In 2009, during the [[Camp Chapman attack]], Maya's fellow officer and friend Jessica ([[Jennifer Ehle]]) is killed. A case manager that likes the Abu Ahmed lead shares with her an interrogation with a Jordanian detainee claiming to have buried Abu Ahmed in 2001. Maya learns what the CIA was told five years earlier: that [[Morocco]] caught Ibrihim Sayeed traveling under the name of Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Realizing her lead may be alive, Maya contacts Dan, now a senior officer at the [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|CIA headquarters]]. She speculates that the CIA's photograph of Ahmed is that of his brother, Habeeb, who was killed in Afghanistan. Maya says that their beards and native clothes make the brothers look alike, explaining Ammar's account of Ahmed's "death" in 2001.

A Kuwaiti prince trades the phone number of Sayeed's mother for a [[Lamborghini]]. CIA operatives use electronic methods to pinpoint a caller in a vehicle who exhibits [[tradecraft]] behaviors that delay confirmation of his identity. They track the vehicle to a large urban compound in [[Abbottabad]], Pakistan, near the [[Pakistan Military Academy]]. After gunmen attack Maya while she is in her vehicle, she is recalled to Washington, D.C.

The CIA puts the compound under surveillance, but obtains no conclusive identification of bin Laden. The President's [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] tasks the CIA with creating a plan to capture or kill bin Laden. Before briefing President [[Barack Obama]], the CIA director ([[James Gandolfini]]) holds a meeting of his senior officers, who estimate that bin Laden is 60-80% likely to be in the compound. Maya, also in the meeting, places her confidence at 100%.

On May 2, 2011, the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment]] flies two [[stealth helicopter]]s from Afghanistan into Pakistan with members of [[United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group|DEVGRU]] and the CIA's [[Special Activities Division|SAD/SOG]] to raid the compound. One helicopter crashes, but the SEALs gain entry and kill a number of people in the compound, including a man they believe is bin Laden. At a U.S. base in [[Jalalabad]], Afghanistan, Maya confirms the identity of the corpse. She boards a military transport back to the U.S., the sole passenger. The pilot asks her destination and she begins to cry.

===Writing===
Bigelow and Boal had initially worked on and finished a screenplay centered on the December 2001 [[Battle of Tora Bora]], and the long, unsuccessful efforts to find Osama bin Laden in the region. The two were about to begin filming when news broke that bin Laden had been killed.

They immediately shelved the film they had been working on and redirected their focus, essentially starting from scratch. "But a lot of the homework I'd done for the first script and a lot of the contacts I made, carried over," Boal remarked during an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. He added, "The years I had spent talking to military and intelligence operators involved in [[counter-terrorism]] was helpful in both projects. Some of the sourcing I had developed long, long ago continued to be helpful for this version."&lt;ref name="EW1"/&gt;

Along with painstakingly recreating the historic night-vision raid on the Abbottabad compound, the script and the film stress the little-reported role of the tenacious young female CIA officer who tracked down Osama bin Laden. Screenwriter Boal said that while researching for the film, "I heard through the grapevine that women played a big role in the CIA in general and in this team. I heard that a woman was there on the night of the raid as one of the CIA's liaison officers on the ground – and that was the start of it." He then turned up stories about a young case officer who was recruited out of college, who had spent her entire career chasing bin Laden. Maya's tough-minded, monomaniacal persona, Boal said, is "based on a real person, but she also represents the work of a lot of other women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/secrets-of-zero-dark-thirty-20130111 |author=Hill, Logan |title=Secrets of 'Zero Dark Thirty' |work=Rolling Stone |date=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014 [[Jane Mayer]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote that "Maya" was modeled in part after CIA officer [[Alfreda Frances Bikowsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/unidentified-queen-torture |last=Mayer |first=Jane |title=The Unidentified Queen of Torture |publisher=The New Yorker |date=December 18, 2014 |accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Manohla Dargis]], who designated the film a ''New York Times'' critics' pick, said that the film "shows the dark side of that war. It shows the unspeakable and lets us decide if the death of Bin Laden was worth the price we paid." Continued Dargis: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is much else to say about the movie, which ends with the harrowing siege of Bin Laden's hideaway by the Navy SEALs (played by, among others, Joel Edgerton and Chris Pratt), much of it shot to approximate the queasy, weirdly unreal green of night-vision goggles. Ms. Bigelow's direction here is unexpectedly stunning, at once bold and intimate: she has a genius for infusing even large-scale action set pieces with the human element. One of the most significant images is of a pool of blood on a floor. It's pitiful, really, and as the movie heads toward its emphatically non-triumphant finish, it is impossible not to realize with anguish that all that came before&amp;nbsp;– the pain, the suffering and the compromised ideals&amp;nbsp;– has led to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|title=By Any Means Necessary: Jessica Chastain in 'Zero Dark Thirty'|work=The New York Times|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2012/12/18/movies/jessica-chastain-in-zero-dark-thirty.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|date=December 17, 2012|accessdate=December 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Richard Corliss]]' review in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called it "a fine" movie and "a police procedural on the grand scale", saying it "blows ''[[Argo (2012 film)|Argo]]'' out of the water".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/11/25/zero-dark-thirty-the-girl-who-got-bin-laden/#ixzz2DHtkIabH|title=Zero Dark Thirty: The Girl Who Got bin Laden|accessdate=November 25, 2012 | work=Time|date=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd McCarthy of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said, "it could well be the most impressive film Bigelow has made, as well as possibly her most personal." Peter Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said: "The ultra-professional result may be easier to respect than enjoy, but there's no denying its power." Critic Katey Rich of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said: "Telling a nearly three-hour story with an ending everyone knows, Bigelow and Boal have managed to craft one of the most intense and intellectually challenging films of the year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/04/zero-dark-thirty-review-kathryn-bigelow|title=Zero Dark Thirty: First Look |work=The Guardian |date=December 4, 2012 |accessdate=December 5, 2012 |location=London |first=Katey |last=Rich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling ''Zero Dark Thirty'' "a milestone in post-Sept. 11 cinema", critic [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' listed the film at number six of the top 10 films of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott|first=A. O.|title=25 Favorites from a Year When 10 Aren't Enough|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/movies/a-o-scotts-25-best-films-of-2012.html?pagewanted=all|date=December 14, 2012|accessdate=December 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New Yorker]]'' film critic [[David Denby (film critic)|David Denby]] lauded the filmmakers for their approach. "The virtue of ''Zero Dark Thirty''," wrote Denby, "is that it pays close attention to the way life does work; it combines ruthlessness and humanity in a manner that is paradoxical and disconcerting yet satisfying as art." But Denby faulted the filmmakers for getting lodged on the divide between fact and fiction.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yet, in attempting to show, in a mainstream movie, the reprehensibility of torture, and what was done in our name, the filmmakers seem to have conflated events, and in this they have generated a sore controversy: the chairs of two Senate committees have said that the information used to find bin Laden was not uncovered through [[waterboarding]]. Do such scenes hurt the movie? Not as art; they are expertly done, without flinching from the horror of the acts and without exploitation. But they damage the movie as an alleged authentic account. Bigelow and Boal&amp;nbsp;– the team behind ''[[The Hurt Locker]]''&amp;nbsp;– want to claim the authority of fact and the freedom of fiction at the same time, and the contradiction mars an ambitious project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Denby|first=David|title='Dead Reckoning'|work=[[The New Yorker]]|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2012/12/24/121224crci_cinema_denby|date=December 24, 2012|accessdate=December 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Steve Coll criticized the early claims for "journalism" with the use of composite characters. He took issue with the film's using the names of historical figures and details of their lives for characters, such as using details for "Ammar" to suggest that he was [[Ali Abdul Aziz Ali]], whose ''[[nom de guerre]]'' was [[Ammar al-Baluchi]]. Coll said the facts about him were different from what was portrayed in the film, which suggests the detainee will never leave the [[black site]]. Al-Baluchi was transferred to Guantanamo in 2006 for a military tribunal. Coll writes: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;He has been an active, defiant participant in Guantánamo court proceedings and his lawyers have sought permission from military judges to introduce evidence in his defense that he was tortured while in CIA custody, and to pursue information about the identities of the agency officers who interrogated him.&lt;ref name="coll"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/feb/07/disturbing-misleading-zero-dark-thirty/?page=1|title='Disturbing' &amp; 'Misleading'|last=Coll|first=Steve|work=[[The New York Review of Books]]|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'''s critic Ann Hornaday, who named ''Zero Dark Thirty'' as the year's best film, noted the divergent takes on the film: "As Boal and Bigelow gather critics' plaudits and awards, the movie itself has entered a fascinating parallel conversation&amp;nbsp;– part food fight for cable-news channels desperate for post-election fodder, part valuable (if belated) civic debate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hornaday|first=Ann|title='Zero Dark Thirty' and the new reality of reported filmmaking|work=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/zero-dark-thirty-and-the-new-reality-of-reported-filmmaking/2012/12/13/3630ce2c-4548-11e2-8e70-e1993528222d_story.html?wprss&amp;google_editors_picks=true'|date=December 13, 2012|accessdate=December 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', critic [[Kenneth Turan]] singled out actress Chastain for her performance. "Her single-minded ferocity and stubbornness not only prove essential in the hunt, but also make up the emotional through line that engages us in the story of ''Zero Dark Thirty''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|title=Review: 'Zero Dark Thirty' tracks Bin Laden's dramatic takedown|work=The Los Angeles Times|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-zero-dark-thirty-review-20121219,0,252655.story|date=December 18, 2012|accessdate=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', film critic [[Joe Morgenstern]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the work of a commanding filmmaker who is willing, as well as able, to confront a full spectrum of moral ambiguity. [ ... ] Others will debate the facts, but I can tell you that ''Zero Dark Thirty'' does not apologize for torture, any more than it denounces it. What it does in the course of telling a seminal story of our time is what contemporary films so rarely do, serve as brilliant provocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morgenstern|first=Joe|title=In 'Zero Dark Thirty,' Zealotry in Pursuit of Zealots|work=The Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323723104578187241515517594?mod=WSJ_LifeStyle_Lifestyle_6|date=December 18, 2012|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three stars out of four and said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The film's opening scenes are not great filmmaking. They're heavy on jargon and impenetrable calculation, murky and heavy on theory. [ ... ] My guess is that much of the fascination with this film is inspired by the unveiling of facts, unclearly seen. There isn't a whole lot of plot&amp;nbsp;– basically, just that Maya thinks she is right, and she is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130102/REVIEWS/130109998|title=Zero Dark Thirty|work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Ebert, Roger|date=January 2, 2013|accessdate=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Edelstein]] said that "[a]s a moral statement, ''Zero Dark Thirty'' is borderline fascistic", but "[a]s a piece of cinema, it's phenomenally gripping&amp;nbsp;– an unholy masterwork."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/12/edelstein-zero-dark-thirty-unholy-masterwork.html|title=Edelstein: ''Zero Dark Thirty'' Is Borderline Fascistic ... and a Masterpiece|last=Edelstein|first=David|date=December 10, 2012|publisher=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist [[Matt Taibbi]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The real problem is what this movie says about us. When those [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib pictures]] came out years ago, at least half of America was horrified. The national consensus (albeit by a frighteningly slim margin) was that this wasn't who we, as a people, wanted to be. But now, four years later, Zero Dark Thirty comes out, and it seems that that we've become so blunted to the horror of what we did and/or are doing at Abu Ghraib and [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo]] and [[Bagram torture and prisoner abuse|Bagram]] and other places that we can accept it, provided we get a boffo movie out of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/taibblog/zero-dark-thirty-is-osama-bin-ladens-last-victory-over-america-20130116|title='Zero Dark Thirty' Is Osama bin Laden's Last Victory Over America|last=Taibbi|first=Matt|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=January 16, 2013|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The film was met with a few negative reviews including the ''[[Daily Mail]]''{{'}}s Chris Tookey remarking, in a 1/5 star review, that Chastain's character was "a cold, opaque, one-dimensional figure, as involving as a pre-programmed cyborg." while adding that "There was the opportunity here to examine a complex, important subject central to the history of our time. However, complexity, depth and character are not Ms Bigelow's forte."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/reviews/article-2267854/Zero-Dark-Thirty-review-Oscar-favourite-torture-watch--subtle-Die-Hard.html |location=London |work=Daily Mail |first=Chris |last=Tookey |title=Zero Dark Thirty: Oscar favourite is torture to watch - and about as subtle as die hard |date=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was also criticized for its factual inaccuracies and its stereotypical portrayal of Pakistan, with dismay being expressed at the botched depiction of, among other things, languages Pakistani nationals speak ([[Arabic]] instead of [[Urdu]] and other regional languages) and the obsolete headgear they wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/782648/zero-iq-thirty|title=Zero IQ Thirty|author=Nadeem F.

==Prequel==
Writer Boal has stated his interest in making the original film on the 2001 [[Tora Bora]] hunt for bin Laden that he and Bigelow conceived. That finished screenplay had been set aside after bin Laden was killed in 2011 to focus on what became ''Zero Dark Thirty.'' "I love reporting, so being on a big story is really exciting to me," said Boal, a former war journalist, of his scramble to write a new script after the event. "But nobody likes to throw out two years of work."&lt;ref&gt;[http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/11/21/zero-dark-thirty-bin-laden-movie/ "'Zero Dark Thirty' Bin Laden Movie"], ''Inside Movies'', 21 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accuracy==
{{further|Search for Osama bin Laden|Death of Osama bin Laden}}

''Zero Dark Thirty'' has received criticism for historical inaccuracy. Former Assistant Secretary of Defense [[Graham T. Allison]] has opined that the film is inaccurate in three important regards: the overstatement of the positive role of enhanced interrogation methods, the understatement of the role of the Obama administration, and the portrayal of the efforts as being driven by one agent battling against the CIA "system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2013/0222/Zero-Dark-Thirty-has-the-facts-wrong-and-that-s-a-problem-not-just-for-the-Oscars |title='Zero Dark Thirty' has the facts wrong – and that's a problem, not just for the Oscars|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |first=Graham |last=Allison |date=February 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, 2015, journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] reported that the Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) had kept bin Laden under house arrest at Abbottabad since 2006, and that Pakistani Army chief [[Pervez Kayani]] and ISI director [[Ahmad Shuja Pasha]] aided the U.S. mission to kill, not capture bin Laden.&lt;ref name=hersh&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hersh|first1=Seymour|title=The Killing of Osama bin Laden|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n10/seymour-m-hersh/the-killing-of-osama-bin-laden|accessdate=11 May 2015|agency=The London Review of Books|publisher=The London Review of Books|date=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Osama Bin Laden was an unarmed elderly 'invalid' when Navy Seals killed him and Barack Obama lied about the mission, report claims|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/osama-bin-laden-was-an-unarmed-elderly-invalid-when-navy-seals-killed-him-and-barack-obama-lied-about-the-mission-report-claims-10241635.html|accessdate=11 May 2015|publisher=The Independent|date=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hersh's U.S. and Pakistani intelligence sources stated that the U.S. had learned of bin Laden's location through an ISI walk-in seeking the $25 million reward and not through tracking a courier; this had been previously reported by R.J.

==Controversy==

===Allegations of partisanship===
Partisan political controversy arose related to the film before shooting began.&lt;ref name="EW1"&gt;[http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/08/06/zero-dark-thirty-first-look/ "Obama not in 'Zero Dark Thirty' thriller about hunt for Osama bin Laden"]; ''Entertainment Weekly;'' August 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama Administration]] charged that ''Zero Dark Thirty'' was scheduled for an October release just before the November [[United States presidential election, 2012|presidential election]] to support his re-election, as Bin Laden's killing is regarded as a success for President Obama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WH leaks for propaganda film |first=Glenn |last=Greenwald |authorlink=Glenn Greenwald |url=http://www.salon.com/2012/05/23/wh_leaks_for_propaganda_film/singleton |newspaper=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=May 23, 2012 |accessdate=May 24, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67tYMTV9h?url=http://www.salon.com/2012/05/23/wh_leaks_for_propaganda_film/singleton/# |archivedate=May 24, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Barack Obama campaigns in Hollywood style |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-05-02/people/31537670_1_michelle-obama-obama-victory-fund-barack-obama |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |date=May 2, 2012 |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony denied that politics was a factor in release scheduling and said the date was the best available spot for an action-thriller in a crowded lineup. The film's screenwriter added, "the president is not depicted in the movie. He's just not in the movie."&lt;ref name="Firstlook"&gt;[http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/07/first-look-at-the-osama-bin-laden-movie/ "First look at the Osama bin Laden movie"]; CNN; August 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The distributor Columbia Pictures, sensitive to political perceptions, considered rescheduling the film release for as late as early 2013. It set a limited-release date for December 19, 2012, well after the election and rendering [[wikt:moot point|moot]] any alleged political conflict.&lt;ref name="EW2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Is Harvey Weinstein Plotting an October Surprise for Obama? |first=John |last=Hudson |url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/05/harvey-weinstein-plotting-october-surprise-obama/52469 |newspaper=The Atlantic Wire |date=May 17, 2012 |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lang1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/10/20/bin-laden-movie-gets-pushed-back "Bin Laden Movie Gets Pushed Back"]; IGN Entertainment; October 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/release-date-of-bin-laden-film-may-change/ "Release Date of Bin Laden Film May Change"]; ''New York Times''; October 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The nationwide release date was pushed back to January 11, 2013, moving it out of the crowded Christmas period and closer to the [[Academy Award]]s.&lt;ref name=2013Release&gt;{{cite news |last=Shaw |first=Lucas |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-rt-us-zerodarkthirty-delaybre8a01rs-20121101,0,4141357.story |title=Kathryn Bigelow's 'Zero Dark Thirty' wide release delayed |date=November 1, 2012 |accessdate=November 2, 2012 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the film's limited release, given the controversy related to the film's depiction of torture and its role in gaining critical information, ''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[Frank Bruni]] concluded that the film is "a far, far cry from the rousing piece of pro-Obama propaganda that some conservatives feared it would be".&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/opinion/sunday/bruni-bin-laden-torture-and-hollywood.html|title=Bin Laden, Torture and Hollywood|last=Bruni|first=Frank|date=December 8, 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, the paper's columnist [[Roger Cohen]] wrote that the film was "a courageous work that is disturbing in the way that art should be". Cohen disagreed with Steve Coll's critique of the screenwriter's stated effort not to "play fast and loose with history", writing that "Boal has honored those words". Cohen ended with a note about a [[Timothy Garton Ash]] analysis of [[George Orwell]] mixing fact and "invented" stories in ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]'' – as further support for Boal's method.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Roger, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/opinion/global/roger-cohen-why-zero-dark-thirty-works.html?_r=0 "Why 'Zero Dark Thirty' Works"], ''New York Times'', February 11, 2013. Retrieved 2013-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of improper access to classified information===
Several Republican sources charged the Obama Administration of improperly providing Bigelow and her team access to classified information during their research for the film. These charges, along with charges of other leaks to the media, became a prevalent election season talking point by conservatives. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] national convention party platform even claimed Obama "has tolerated publicizing the details of the operation to kill the leader of Al Qaeda."&lt;ref name="Lang1"/&gt; No release of these details has been proven.&lt;ref name="APNews"&gt;[http://www.navytimes.com/news/2012/08/ap-special-operators-tell-anti-obama-groups-zip-it-082112/ "Special Operators to Anti-Obama Groups: Zip It"]; AP News, ''Navy Times''; August 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican congressman [[Peter T. King]] requested that the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the [[United States Defense Department|U.S. Defense Department]] investigate if classified information was inappropriately released; both departments said they would look into it.&lt;ref name="Investigate"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/movies/film-on-bin-laden-hunt-leads-to-pentagon-investigation.html?_r=1&amp;ref=petertking |title=Film About the Hunt for Bin Laden Leads to a Pentagon Investigation |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Michael |last=Cieply |date=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA responded to Congressman King writing, "the protection of national security equities&amp;nbsp;– including the preservation of our ability to conduct effective counterterrorism operations&amp;nbsp;– is the decisive factor in determining how the CIA engages with filmmakers and the media as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;[http://homeland.house.gov/sites/homeland.house.gov/files/documents/pdf/110811_CIA_Letter.pdf "Letter from the CIA to King re: possible leaks"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916174246/http://homeland.house.gov/sites/homeland.house.gov/files/documents/pdf/110811_CIA_Letter.pdf |date=September 16, 2012 }}; House website; November 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservative watchdog group [[Judicial Watch]] publicized CIA and U.S. Defense Department documents obtained through a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request, and alleged that "unusual access to agency information" was granted to the filmmakers. But, an examination of the documents showed no evidence that classified information was leaked to the filmmakers. In addition, CIA records did not show any involvement by the White House in relation to the filmmakers.&lt;ref name="EW2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lang1"&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-rt-us-zerodarkthirty-ciabre87s1et-20120829,0,5339438.story "Government communicated with "Zero Dark Thirty" makers"]; ''Chicago Tribune''; August 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The filmmakers have said they were not given access to classified details about Osama bin Laden's killing.&lt;ref name="Child"/&gt;

In January 2013, [[Reuters]] reported that the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] will review the contacts between the CIA and the filmmakers to find out whether Bigelow and Boal had inappropriate access to classified information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/03/us-usa-ciafilm-idUSBRE90200420130103 |title=Senate panel to examine CIA contacts with 'Zero Dark Thirty' filmmakers |publisher=[[Reuters]] |author=Hosenball, Mark |date=January 2, 2013 |accessdate=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February, Reuters reported that the inquiry was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/25/entertainment-us-usa-congress-cia-film-idUSBRE91O19F20130225 |title=Senate Intelligence Committee drops bin Laden film probe |publisher=[[Reuters]] |author=Hosenball, Mark |date=February 25, 2013 |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, an unreleased [[U.S. Defense Department Inspector General]]'s office report stated that former CIA Director Leon Panetta, while giving a presentation at a private awards ceremony, disclosed information classified as "Secret" and "Top Secret" regarding personnel involved in the raid on the Bin Laden compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pogo.org/our-work/articles/2013/unreleased-probe-finds-cia-disclosed-secret-info.html |title=Report: Panetta disclosed top secret info to "Zero Dark Thirty" filmmaker |publisher=[[Project on Government Oversight|POGO]] |author=Zagorin, Adam, Hilzenrath, David S. |date=June 4, 2013 |accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of pro-torture stance===
{{anchor|Torture}}
The film has been both criticized and praised for its handling of subject matter, including the portrayal of harsh interrogation techniques, commonly classified as torture. The use of these techniques was long kept secret by the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]. (See [[Torture Memos]].) [[Glenn Greenwald]], in ''[[The Guardian]]'', stated that the film takes a pro-torture stance, describing it as "pernicious propaganda" and stating that it "presents torture as its CIA proponents and administrators see it: as a dirty, ugly business that is necessary to protect America."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Critic [[Frank Bruni]] concluded that the film appears to suggest "No waterboarding, no Bin Laden".&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Jesse David Fox writes that the film "doesn't explicitly say that torture caught bin Laden, but in portraying torture as one part of the successful search, it can be read that way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/12/does-zero-dark-thirty-endorse-torture.html|title=Does ''Zero Dark Thirty'' Endorse Torture?|last=Fox|first=Jesse David|date=December 10, 2012|publisher=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Bazelon]] said, "The filmmakers didn't set out to be Bush-Cheney apologists", but "they adopted a close-to-the-ground point of view, and perhaps they're in denial about how far down the path to condoning torture this led them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2012/12/zero_dark_thirty_and_torture_does_kathryn_bigelow_s_bin_laden_movie_make.2.html|title=Does ''Zero Dark Thirty'' Advocate Torture?|last=Bazelon|first=Emily|date=December 11, 2012|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Michael Wolff (journalist)|Michael Wolff]] slammed the film as a "nasty piece of pulp and propaganda" and Bigelow as a "fetishist and sadist" for distorting history with a pro-torture viewpoint. Wolff disputed the efficacy of torture and the claim that it contributed to the discovery of bin Laden.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In an open letter, social critic and feminist [[Naomi Wolf]] criticized Bigelow for claiming the film was "part documentary" and speculated over the reasons for Bigelow's "amoral compromising" of film-making, suggesting that the more pro-military a film, the easier it is to acquire Pentagon support for scenes involving expensive, futuristic military equipment. Wolf likened Bigelow to the acclaimed director and propagandist for the [[Nazi regime]], [[Leni Riefenstahl]], saying: "Like Riefenstahl, you are a great artist. But now you will be remembered forever as torture's handmaiden."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Author [[Karen J. Greenberg]] wrote that "Bigelow has bought in, hook, line, and sinker, to the ethos of the Bush administration and its apologists" and called the film "the perfect piece of propaganda, with all the appeal that naked brutality, fear, and revenge can bring".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; [[Peter Maass]] of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' said the film "represents a troubling new frontier of government-embedded filmmaking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/12/dont-trust-zero-dark-thirty/266253/#|title=Don't Trust 'Zero Dark Thirty'|last=Maass|first=Peter|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jane Mayer]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'', who has published ''[[The Dark Side (book)|The Dark Side]]'', a book about the use of torture during the Bush administration, criticized the film, saying that Bigelow was

&lt;blockquote&gt;milk[ing] the U.S. torture program for drama while sidestepping the political and ethical debate that it provoked ... [By] excising the moral debate that raged over the interrogation program during the Bush years, the film also seems to accept almost without question that the CIA's '[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]' played a key role in enabling the agency to identify the courier who unwittingly led them to bin Laden.&lt;ref name="Mayer1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2012/12/torture-in-kathryn-bigelows-zero-dark-thirty.html#ixzz2FEv7RPBo|title=ZERO CONSCIENCE IN "ZERO DARK THIRTY"|last=Mayer|first=Jane|date=December 14, 2012|work=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author [[Greg Mitchell]] wrote that "the film's depiction of torture helping to get bin Laden is muddled at best&amp;nbsp;– but the overall impression by the end, for most viewers, probably will be: Yes, torture played an important (if not the key) role."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/171735/my-view-zero-dark-thirty-shows-torture-playing-key-role-getting-bin-laden#|title=My View: 'Zero Dark Thirty' Shows Torture Playing Key Role in Getting bin Laden|last=Mitchell|first=Greg|date=December 12, 2012|work=[[The Nation]]|accessdate=December 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filmmaker [[Alex Gibney]] called the film a "stylistic masterwork" but criticized the "irresponsible and inaccurate" depiction of torture, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;there is no cinematic evidence in the film that [[Enhanced interrogation techniques|EITs]] led to false information&amp;nbsp;– lies that were swallowed whole because of the misplaced confidence in the efficacy of torture. Most students of this subject admit that torture can lead to the truth. But what Boal/Bigelow fail to show is how often the CIA deluded itself into believing that torture was a magic bullet, with disastrous results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alex-gibney/zero-dark-thirty-torture_b_2345589.html|title=Zero Dark Thirty's Wrong and Dangerous Conclusion |last=Gibney|first=Alex|date=December 21, 2012|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]], in an article for ''The Guardian'', criticized what he perceived a "normalization" of torture in the film, arguing that the mere neutrality on an issue many see as revolting is already a type of endorsement ''per se''. Žižek proposed that if a similar film was made about a brutal rape or the [[Holocaust]], such a movie would "embody a deeply immoral fascination with its topic, or it would count on the obscene neutrality of its style to engender dismay and horror in spectators." Žižek further panned Bigelow's stance of coldly presenting the issue in a rational manner, instead of being dogmatically rejected as a repulsive, unethical proposition.&lt;ref name="zizek"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/25/zero-dark-thirty-normalises-torture-unjustifiable|title=''Zero Dark Thirty'': Hollywood's gift to American power |author=Slavoj Žižek |work=The Guardian |date=January 25, 2013 |accessdate=18 March 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Steve Coll]], who has written on foreign policy, national security and the bin Laden family, criticized the filmmakers for saying the film was "journalistic", which implies that it is based in fact. At the same time, they claimed [[artistic license]], which he described "as an excuse for shoddy reporting about a subject as important as whether torture had a vital part in the search for bin Laden".&lt;ref name="coll"/&gt; Coll wrote that "arguably, the film's degree of emphasis on torture's significance goes beyond what even the most die-hard defenders of the CIA interrogation regime [...] have argued", as he said it was shown as critical at several points.&lt;ref name="coll"/&gt;

U.S. Senator [[John McCain]], who was tortured during [[Early life and military career of John McCain#Prisoner of war|his time as a prisoner of war]] in [[North Vietnam]], said that the film left him sick&amp;nbsp;– "because it's wrong". In a speech in the Senate, he said, "Not only did the use of enhanced interrogation techniques on [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] not provide us with key leads on bin Laden's courier, Abu Ahmed, it actually produced false and misleading information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/12/18/sen-mccain-rejects-torture-scene-in-zero-dark-thirty/|title=Sen.

You have a social and moral obligation to get the facts right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/senators-call-zero-dark-thirty-405613 |title=Senators Call 'Zero Dark Thirty' 'Grossly Inaccurate' in Letter to Sony Pictures |work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=December 19, 2012 |accessdate=December 20, 2012 |author=Daunt, Tina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Morell]], the CIA's acting director, sent a public letter on December 21, 2012 to the agency's employees, which said that ''Zero Dark Thirty''

&lt;blockquote&gt;takes significant artistic license, while portraying itself as being historically accurate ... [The film] creates the strong impression that the enhanced interrogation techniques that were part of our former detention and interrogation program were the key to finding {{Not a typo|Bin Ladin}}. That impression is false. ( ... ) [T]he truth is that multiple streams of intelligence led CIA analysts to conclude that {{Not a typo|Bin Ladin}} was hiding in Abbottabad. Some came from detainees subjected to enhanced techniques, but there were many other sources as well. And, importantly, whether enhanced interrogation techniques were the only timely and effective way to obtain information from those detainees, as the film suggests, is a matter of debate that cannot and never will be definitively resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/acting-cia-director-disputes-zero-406258 |title=Acting CIA Director Disputes 'Zero Dark Thirty' Accuracy in Rare Public Statement|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=December 21, 2012 |accessdate=December 22, 2012 |author=Daunt, Tina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[The Huffington Post]]'' writer, [[G. Roger Denson]], countered this, saying that the filmmakers were being made scapegoats for information openly admitted by government and intelligence officials. Denson said that [[Leon Panetta]], three days after Osama bin Laden's death, seemed to say that waterboarding was a means of extracting reliable and crucial information in the hunt for bin Laden.&lt;ref name="Denson, G. Roger"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/g-roger-denson/zero-dark-thirty-torture-scenes_b_2379609.html |title=Zero Dark Thirty Account of Torture Verified by Media Record of Legislators and CIA Officials |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=December 31, 2012 |accessdate=January 17, 2013 |author=Denson, G. Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denson noted Panetta speaking as the CIA chief in May 2011, saying that "enhanced interrogation techniques were used to extract information that led to the mission's success". Panetta said waterboarding was among the techniques used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/g-roger-denson/zero-dark-thirty-defendin_b_2357702.html |title=Zero Dark Thirty: Why the Film's Makers Should Be Defended And What Deeper bin Laden Controversy Has Been Stirred |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=December 25, 2012 |accessdate=December 28, 2012 |author=Denson, G. Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''Huffington Post'' article written a week later, Denson cited other statements from Bush government officials saying that torture had yielded information to locate bin Laden.&lt;ref name="Denson, G. Roger"/&gt;

National security reporter [[Spencer Ackerman]] said the film "does not present torture as a silver bullet that led to bin Laden; it presents torture as the ignorant alternative to that silver bullet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/12/zero-dark-thirty/|title=Two Cheers for 'Zero Dark Thirty's' Torture Scenes|last=Ackerman|first=Spencer|date=December 10, 2012|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Glenn Kenny]] said that he "saw a movie that subverted a lot of expectations concerning viewer identification and empathy" and that "rather than endorsing the barbarity, the picture makes the viewer in a sense complicit with it", which is "[a] whole other can of worms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://somecamerunning.typepad.com/some_came_running/2012/12/anti-torture-anti-art.html|title="Zero Dark Thirty:" Perception, reality, perception again, and "the art defense"|last=Kenny|first=Glenn|date=December 17, 2012|work=Some Come Running|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Andrew Sullivan]] said, "the movie is not an apology for torture, as so many have said, and as I have worried about. It is an ''exposure'' of torture. It removes any doubt that war criminals ran this country for seven years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/12/the-torture-narrative.html|title=Kathryn Bigelow: Not A Torture Apologist|last=Sullivan|first=Andrew|date=December 14, 2012|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] similarly said, "I left the movie thinking it made an incredible statement against torture", and noted that the film showed the abject brutality of torture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/25/michael-moore-zero-dark-thirty-torture_n_2552123.html Michael Moore On 'Zero Dark Thirty' &amp; Torture: Movie Doesn't Condone Enhanced Interrogation]; Huffington Post; January 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Andrew O'Hehir said that the filmmaker's position on torture in the film is ambiguous, and creative choices were made and the film poses "excellent questions for us to ask ourselves, arguably defining questions of the age, and I think the longer you look at them the thornier they get".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/12/01/is_feminism_worth_defending_with_torture/|title=Is feminism worth defending with torture? |last=O'Hehir|first=Andrew|date=December 1, 2012|publisher=Salon|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Screenwriter Boal described the pro-torture accusations as "preposterous", stating that "it's just misreading the film to say that it shows torture leading to the information about bin Laden", while director Bigelow added: "Do I wish [torture] was not part of that history? Yes. But it was."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/awards/column-post/zero-dark-thirty-steps-line-fire-answers-critics-68781?page=0,0|title='Zero Dark Thirty' Steps into the Line of Fire, Answers Critics|last=Pond|first=Steve|work=The Warp|accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013 in the ''Wall Street Journal'', Boal responded to the Senate critics, being quoted as saying "[D]oes that mean they can use the movie as a political platform to talk about what they've been wanting to talk about for years and years and years? Do I think that Feinstein used the movie as a publicity tool to get a conversation going about her report? I believe it, ... " referring to the intelligence committee's report on enhanced interrogations. He also said the senators' letter showed they were still concerned about public opinion supporting the effectiveness of torture and didn't want the movie reinforcing that. Boal said, though, "I don't think that [effectiveness] issue has really been resolved" if there is a suspect with possible knowledge of imminent attack who will not talk.&lt;ref&gt;Kaminsky, Matthew, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324162304578306292338216514?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_opinion "The Art and Politics of 'Zero Dark Thirty'"], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', February 15, 2013. Retrieved 2013-02-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Mark Bowden]] argued that the film is neither pro- nor anti-torture: "[P]ure storytelling is not always about making an argument, no matter how worthy. It can be simply about telling the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/01/zero-dark-thirty-is-not-pro-torture/266759/|title='Zero Dark Thirty' Is Not Pro-Torture|last=Bowden|first=Mark|date=January 3, 2013|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Bigelow said: "I'm proud of the movie, and I stand behind it completely. I think that it's a deeply moral movie that questions the use of force. It questions what was done in the name of finding bin Laden."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/01/24/cover-story-kathryn-bigelows-art-of-darkness/|title=Cover Story: Kathryn Bigelow's Art of Darkness|last=Winter|first=Jessica|date=January 24, 2013|work=Time|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 interview on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', Bigelow said the film showed many techniques of intelligence gathering used to find bin Laden, such as electronic surveillance, troops at the ground level, and "good, old-fashioned, boots-on-the-ground sleuthing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/423116/january-22-2013/kathryn-bigelow|title=Kathryn Bigelow|work=The Colbert Report|date=January 22, 2013|accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objections over the unattributed and unauthorized use of recordings of 9/11 victims===
An extensive clip of the phone call to headquarters from [[Betty Ong]], a flight attendant on one of the hijacked American Airlines planes, was used in the beginning of the film without attribution.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2013-02-24&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/movies/9-11-victims-family-raises-objection-to-zero-dark-thirty.html|title=9-11 victim's family raises objection to Zero Dark Thirty|work=[[New York Times]]|author=Michael Cieply|date=2013-02-23|archivedate=2013-02-24|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2013%2F02%2F23%2Fmovies%2F9-11-victims-family-raises-objection-to-zero-dark-thirty.html&amp;date=2013-02-24|deadurl=No|quote=The Ong family is also asking that the filmmakers donate to a charitable foundation that was set up in Ms. Ong's name. Further, they want Sony Pictures Entertainment, which is distributing ''Zero Dark Thirty'' in the United States, to include a credit for Ms. Ong and a statement on both its Web site and on home entertainment versions of the film making clear that the Ong family does not endorse torture, which is depicted in the film, an account of the search for Osama bin Laden.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ong's family requested that, if the film won any awards, the filmmakers apologize at the Academy Awards ceremony for using the clip without getting her heirs' consent. Her family also asked that the film's U.S. distributors make a charitable donation in Ong's name, and should go on record that the Ong family does not endorse the use of torture, which is depicted in the film during the search for Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2013-02-24/&gt;

Mary and Frank Fetchet, parents of Brad Fetchet, who worked on the 89th floor of the World Trade Center's south tower, criticized the filmmakers for using a recording of their son's voicemail without permission. The recording has previously been heard in broadcast TV news reports and in testimony for the [[9/11 Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57571228/9-11-families-upset-over-zero-dark-thirty-recordings/|title=9/11 families upset over "Zero Dark Thirty" recordings|publisher=CBS News|date=February 25, 2013|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
