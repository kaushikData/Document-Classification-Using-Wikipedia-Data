'''Alma Marie Sullivan Reed''' (1889–1966) was a US journalist.  While working in [[Mexico]] in the 1920s, she fell in love with the governor of Yucatán, [[Felipe Carrillo Puerto]]; however, he was assassinated while she was home in San Francisco preparing for their wedding. Reed was a promoter of the career of [[Mexican muralism|Mexican muralist]] [[José Clemente Orozco]]&lt;ref&gt;Helen Delpar, ''The Enormous Vogue of Things Mexican: Cultural Relations between the United States and Mexico, 1920-1935''. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press 1992, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote a biography of him&lt;ref&gt;Alma M. Reed ''Orozco''. New York: Oxford University Press 1956&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a work on Mexican muralists generally.&lt;ref&gt;Alma M. Reed, ''The Mexican Muralists''. New York: Crown 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

A San Francisco native, Reed was born Alma Sullivan into an Irish Catholic family in 1889. Her marriage to businessman Samuel Payne Reed ended in annulment after he became ill. Outspoken, adventurous and bohemian, she carried what one observer described as the "mystic ailments that sometimes befall the people" of California.

==Journalism career==

She rose to fame as a journalist while writing for the ''San Francisco Call''. An advocate for the disenfranchised, she was responsible for helping change the state's death penalty laws after she wrote a series of articles in 1921 about the death sentence given to a 17-year-old Mexican boy convicted of murder. Her articles led to the state commuting his sentence.
Her writing won her an invitation by Mexican President [[Alvaro Obregón]] to be his guest in Mexico City. While traveling through the Yucatán, she wrote another series of articles on the thefts of Mayan artifacts for the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] at [[Harvard University]] by US explorer and archaeologist Edward Thompson. The articles led the museum to return some of the objects to Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Delpar, ''The Enormous Vogue'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art Patron==

The ''New York Times'' took notice of the young journalist and hired her to continue reporting from Mexico and later the Middle East. By 1928, she settled in New York City and dubbed her apartment "the Ashram" to honor the Hindu hermitage where sages lived in peace among nature and to pay homage to [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s pacifism. Reed was a lifelong supporter and patron of [[José Clemente Orozco]]. Early after establishing the studio, Reed was introduced to Orozco by [[Anita Brenner]].&lt;ref&gt;Delpar, ''The Enormous Vogue'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Orozco had been living in Manhattan and doing poorly in making a living. She immediately fell in love with his work and gave him a one-man show in September 1928. The financial arrangements with Reed were fraught, with Orozco believing that Reed "was not giving him an adequate share of the proceeds from the sale of his works."&lt;ref&gt;Delpar, ''The Enormous Vogue'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; She nonetheless continued to support his career.

Her studio became a gathering place for Mexican artists especially those living in New York. She became friends with Jose L. Gutierrez who was a WPA fresco supervisor and was experimenting at [[Sherwin-Williams]] laboratories with plastic resins, which led to plastic paint formulas developed in 1953 as the first acrylic artist paint called "[[Politec]]."

Not long after the exhibition, she rented a portion of the top floor of the building on East 57th Street and established a formal gallery called "Delphic Studios". She promoted many Mexican artists but she remained the principal patron for Orozco. She also exhibited the Mexican-themed watercolors and oils of Los Angeles artist [[Leo Politi]] in 1937. The one-man exhibit helped launch Politi's career as an author and illustrator of children's books.

The '''B612 Foundation''' is a private [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[Private foundation (United States)|foundation]] headquartered in [[Mill Valley, California]], United States, dedicated to [[Asteroid impact avoidance|planetary defense]] against [[asteroid]]s and other  [[Impact event|near-Earth object (NEO) impacts]]. It is led mainly by scientists, former astronauts and engineers from the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], [[Southwest Research Institute]], [[Stanford University]], [[NASA]] and the [[space industry]].

As a [[non-governmental organization]] it has conducted two lines of related research to help detect NEOs that could one day strike the [[Earth]], and find the technological means to divert their path to avoid such collisions. The organization has publicized the true rate of "city-killer" type impacts of the same magnitude as the explosive [[Tunguska event|1908 Tunguska event]], a rate which is from three to ten times greater than previously believed, or about every century on average. {{citation needed|date=September 2018}} It also assisted the [[Association of Space Explorers]] in helping the [[United Nations]] establish the [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space#Near-Earth object deflection and disaster response|International Asteroid Warning Network]], as well as a  Space Missions Planning Advisory Group to provide oversight on proposed [[Asteroid impact avoidance#Collision avoidance strategies|asteroid deflection]] missions.

In 2012, the foundation announced it would design and build a privately financed asteroid-finding [[space observatory]], the [[Sentinel Space Telescope]], to be launched in 2017–2018. Once stationed in a [[heliocentric orbit]] around the Sun similar to that of [[Venus]], Sentinel's supercooled [[infrared detector]] will help identify dangerous asteroids and other NEOs that pose a risk of collision with Earth. In the absence of substantive planetary defense provided by governments worldwide, B612 is conducting a fundraising campaign to cover the Sentinel Mission, estimated at $450 million for 10 years of operation.
Fund raising has been very slow—raising only {{USD|3 million}} in 2012 and 2013—and, as of June 2015, NASA is re-examining its reliance on private sector approach to space-based NEO survey missions.&lt;ref name=nature20150619/&gt;

== Background ==
{{main|Impact events|Asteroid impact avoidance}}
When an [[asteroid]] enters the planet's atmosphere it becomes known as a '[[meteor]]'; those that survive and fall to the Earth's surface are then called '[[meteorite]]s'. While basketball-sized meteors occur almost daily, and compact car-sized ones about yearly, they usually burn up or explode high above the Earth as [[bolide]]s, (fireballs), often with little notice.  During an average 24-hour period, the Earth sweeps through some 100 million particles of interplanetary dust and pieces of cosmic debris, only a very minor amount of which arrives on the ground as meteorites.&lt;ref name="USA Today-2013.10.06" /&gt;

[[File:Meteor Crater (crop-tight).jpg|thumb|left|The 1,200 meter-wide [[Meteor Crater]] in [[Arizona]], United States, created by a 46 meter-diameter asteroid impact. A visitors centre is visible beyond the far rim.]]

The larger in size asteroids or other [[near-Earth object]]s (NEOs) are, the less frequently they impact the planet's atmosphere — large meteors seen in the skies are extremely rare, while medium-sized ones are less so, and much smaller ones are more commonplace. Although stony asteroids often explode high in the atmosphere, some objects, especially [[iron meteorite|iron-nickel meteors]] and other types descending at a steep angle,&lt;ref name="Atlantic-2008.06.01" /&gt; can explode close to ground level or even directly impact onto land or sea. In the U.S. [[Arizona|State of Arizona]], the {{Convert|1200|m}}-wide [[Meteor Crater]] (officially named Barringer Crater) formed in a fraction of a second as nearly 160 million tonnes of limestone and bedrock were uplifted, creating its crater rim on formerly flat terrain. The asteroid that produced the Barringer Crater was only about 46 meters (150&amp;nbsp;ft.) in size; however it impacted the ground at a velocity of 12.8 kilometers per second (28,600&amp;nbsp;mph) and struck with an impact energy equivalent to a 10 megaton ([[TNT equivalent]]) nuclear bomb — about 625 times greater than the [[Little Boy|bomb that destroyed the city of Hiroshima]] during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="Melosh, Collins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schaber" /&gt; [[Tsunami]]s can also occur after a medium-sized or larger asteroid impacts an ocean surface or other large body of water.&lt;ref name="Paine" /&gt;

[[Image:Toutatis.jpg|thumb|right|A radar image of the almost 2 km wide [[4179 Toutatis|Asteroid 4179 Toutatis]], one of many objects that [[potentially hazardous asteroid|could pose a severe catastrophic threat]]]]

The probability of a mid-sized asteroid (similar to the one that [[Tunguska event|destroyed the Tunguska River area of Russia in 1908]]) hitting Earth during the 21st century has been estimated at about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez, Vittorio. [http://www.ibtimes.com.au/former-nasa-astronaut-predicts-30-chance-near-earth-asteroid-hit-within-century-1306747 Former NASA Astronaut Predicts 30% Chance of Near-Earth Asteroid Hit Within Century], ''[[International Business Times]]'', March 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the Earth is currently more populated than in previous eras, there is a greater risk of large casualties arising from a mid-sized asteroid impact.&lt;ref name="Ashbury Park Press-2013.03.27" /&gt;  However, as of the early 2010s, only about a half of one per cent of Tunguska-type NEOs had been located by astronomers using ground-based telescope surveys.&lt;ref name="New York Times-2013.11.06" /&gt;

The need for an asteroid detection program has been compared to the need for monsoon, typhoon, and hurricane preparedness.&lt;ref name="USA Today-2013.10.06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired-2014.04" /&gt; As the B612 Foundation and other organizations have publicly noted, of the different types of [[Disaster|natural catastrophes]] that can occur on our planet, asteroid strikes are the only one that the world now has the technical capability to prevent.

B612 is one of several organizations to propose detailed dynamic surveys of NEOs and preventative measures such as asteroid deflection.&lt;ref name="Discover-2013.10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist-2013.07.03" /&gt; Other groups include Chinese researchers, [[NASA]] in the United States, [[NEOShield]] in Europe, as well as the international [[The Spaceguard Foundation|Spaceguard Foundation]].  In December 2009 [[Russian Federal Space Agency|Roscosmos Russian Federal Space Agency]] director [[Anatoly Perminov]] proposed a deflection mission to the 325 metres (1,066&amp;nbsp;ft) wide asteroid [[99942 Apophis]], which at the time had been thought to pose a risk of collision with Earth.&lt;ref name="New York Times-2009.12.30" /&gt;&lt;ref name="World Post-2009.12.30" /&gt;

=== Asteroid deflection workshop ===
The Foundation evolved from an informal one-day workshop on [[Asteroid impact avoidance#Collision avoidance strategies|asteroid deflection]] strategies during October 2001, organized by Dutch [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] [[Piet Hut]] along with physicist and then-U.S. astronaut [[Ed Lu]], presented at [[NASA Johnson Space Center|NASA's Johnson Space Center]] in Houston, Texas.  Twenty researchers participated, principally from various NASA facilities plus the non-profit [[Southwest Research Institute]], but as well from the University of California, University of Michigan, and the Institute for Independent Study. All were interested in contributing to the proposed creation of an asteroid deflection capability.&lt;ref name="B612-Foundation History-2004.03.22" /&gt; The seminar participants included [[Rusty Schweickart]], a former [[List of Apollo astronauts|Apollo astronaut]], and [[Clark Chapman]], a [[Planetary science|planetary scientist]].&lt;ref name="B612 Foundation History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Universe Today-2005.06.07" /&gt;

Among the proposed experimental research missions discussed were the alteration of an asteroid's spin rate, as well as changing the orbit of one part of a binary asteroid pair.&lt;ref name="B612 Foundation History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Universe Today-2005.06.07" /&gt; Following the seminar's round-table discussions the workshop generally agreed that the vehicle of choice (needed to deflect an asteroid) would be powered by a low-thrust ion plasma engine. Landing a nuclear-powered [[Plasma propulsion engine|plasma engined]] pusher vehicle on the asteroid's surface was seen as promising, an early proposal that would later encounter a number of technical obstacles.&lt;ref name="NPR-2005.11.10" /&gt;  Nuclear explosives were seen as "too risky and unpredictable" for several reasons,&lt;ref name="NPR-2005.11.10" /&gt; warranting the view that gently altering an asteroid's trajectory was the safest approach—but also a method requiring years of advance warning to successfully accomplish.&lt;ref name="B612-Foundation History-2004.03.22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Universe Today-2005.06.07" /&gt;

== B612 Project and Foundation ==
The October 2001 asteroid deflection workshop participants created the "B612 Project" to further their research. Schweickart, along with Drs. Hut, Lu and Chapman, then formed the B612 Foundation on October 7, 2002,&lt;ref name="B612 Foundation History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Universe Today-2005.06.07" /&gt; with its first goal being to "significantly alter the orbit of an asteroid in a controlled manner".&lt;ref name="Institute for Advanced Study-Piet Hut" /&gt; Schweickart became an early public face of the foundation and served as [[board of directors|Chair on its board of directors]].&lt;ref name="Universe Today-2010.10.14" /&gt; In 2010, as part of an ''ad hoc'' task force on planetary defense, he advocated increasing NASA's annual budget by $250M–$300 million over a 10-year period (with an operational maintenance budget of up to $75 million per year after that) in order to more fully catalog the [[near-Earth object]]s (NEOs) that can poise a threat to Earth, and to also fully develop impact avoidance capabilities.  That recommended level of budgetary support would permit up to 10–20 years of advance warning in order to create a sufficient window for the required trajectory deflection.&lt;ref name="NASA-Task Force Planetary Defense-2010.10.06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times-2010.10.25" /&gt;

Their recommendations were made to a NASA Advisory Council, but were ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining Congressional funding due to NASA, lacking a legislated mandate for [[Asteroid impact avoidance|planetary protection]],&lt;ref name="Atlantic-2008.06.01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Popular Mechanics-2006.12" /&gt; not being permitted to request it.&lt;ref name="Discover-2013.09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="National Geographic-2004.03.08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific American-2013.10.28" /&gt; Feeling it would be imprudent to continue waiting for substantive government or United Nations action,&lt;ref name="RIA Novosti-2014.08.14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR-2013.11.03" /&gt; B612 began a fundraising campaign in 2012 to cover the approximate US$450 million cost for the development, launch and operations of an asteroid-finding [[Space observatory|space telescope]],&lt;ref name="Discovery.com-2013.10.28" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B612-Media Release-2012.09.19" /&gt; to be called [[Sentinel Space Telescope|Sentinel]], with a goal of raising $30 to $40 million per year.&lt;ref name="Aviation Week-2013.04.09" /&gt; The [[space observatory]]'s objective would be to accurately survey NEOs from an orbit similar to that Venus, creating a large dynamic catalog of such objects that would help identify dangerous Earth-impactors, deemed a necessary precursor to mounting any asteroid deflection mission.

[[File:2013 Senate testimony Ed Lu.webm|thumb|"Assessing the Risks, Impacts and Solutions for Space Threats"; testimony before a U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Science &amp; Space, March 2013&lt;ref name="SpacePolicyOnline.com-2013.04.04" /&gt; (video)]]

In March and April 2013, several weeks after the [[Chelyabinsk meteor]] explosion injured some 1,500 people, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] held hearings for "...the Risks, Impacts and Solutions for Space Threats". They received testimony from B612 head Ed Lu (see video at right), as well as Dr. Donald K. Yeomans, head of NASA's NEO Program Office, Dr. [[Michael A'Hearn]] of the University of Maryland and co-chair of a 2009 U.S. National Research Council study on asteroid  threats, plus others.&lt;ref name="SpacePolicyOnline.com-2013.04.04" /&gt; The difficulty of quickly intercepting an imminent asteroid threat to Earth was made apparent during the testimony:

{{quote|REP. STEWART: ... are we technologically capable of launching something that could intercept [an asteroid with 2 years of advance warning]? ... &lt;br&gt;DR. A'HEARN: No. If we had spacecraft plans on the books already, that would take a year ... I mean a typical small mission ... takes four years from approval to start to launch ... | author=[[Chris Stewart (politician)|Rep. Chris Stewart (R–UT)]] and Dr. Michael F. A'Hearn, April 10, 2013 | source=United States Congress&lt;ref name="US Congress-2013.04.10" /&gt;}}

As a result of a set of hearings by the NASA Advisory Committee following the Chelyabinsk explosion in 2013, in conjunction with a White House request to double its budget, NASA's Near Earth Object Program funding was increased to $40.5 M/year in its FY2014 (Fiscal Year 2014) budget.  It had previously been increased to $20.5 M/year in FY2012 (about 0.1% of NASA's annual budget at the time),&lt;ref name="Discover-2013.09" /&gt; from an average of about $4 M/year between 2002 and 2010.&lt;ref name="NASA HQ-NEOOP-2014.02.28" /&gt;

=== Asteroid hazard reassessment ===
On [[Earth Day]], April 22, 2014, the B612 Foundation formally presented a revised assessment on the frequency of "city-killer" type impact events, based on research led by Canadian planetary scientist Peter Brown of the [[University of Western Ontario]]'s (UWO) [[CPSX|Centre for Planetary Science and Exploration]].&lt;ref name="Christian Science Monitor-2014.04.23" /&gt; Dr. Brown's analysis, "A 500-Kiloton Airburst Over Chelyabinsk and An Enhanced Hazard from Small Impactors", published in the journals [[Science (journal)|Science]] and [[Nature (journal)|Nature]],&lt;ref name="New York Times-2013.11.06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature-2013.11.06" /&gt; was used to produce a short computer-animated video that was presented to the media at the [[Museum of Flight|Seattle Museum of Flight]].&lt;ref name="Aviation Week-2014.04.23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B612-Impact video media release 2014.04.17" /&gt;

The nearly one and a half minute video displayed a rotating globe with the impact points of about 25 asteroids measuring more than one, and up to 600 kilotons of blast force, that struck the Earth from 2000–2013 (for comparison, the [[Little Boy|nuclear bomb that destroyed Hiroshima]] was equivalent to about [[TNT equivalent|16 kilotons of TNT]] blast force).&lt;ref name="Christian Science Monitor-2014.04.23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B612-impact video" /&gt; Of those impacts between 2000 and 2013, eight of them were as large, or larger, than the Hiroshima bomb.&lt;ref name="Wired-2014.04" /&gt; Only one of the asteroids, [[2008 TC3|2008 TC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], was [[Asteroid impact prediction|detected in advance]], some 19 hours before exploding in the atmosphere. As was the case with the [[Chelyabinsk meteor|2013 Chelyabinsk meteor]], no warnings were issued for any of the other impacts.&lt;ref name="BBC News-2014.04.22" /&gt;{{#tag:ref|

[[2008 TC3|2008 TC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], an 80-tonne,  4.1-meter (13 ft)  diameter asteroid,&lt;ref name="Nature-2009.Iss.7237" /&gt; entered Earth's atmosphere on October 7, 2008,&lt;ref name="Discover Magazine-2008.10.06" /&gt; and exploded over the [[Nubian Desert]] in [[Sudan]].  It was the first time an asteroid impact had been predicted prior to its entry into the atmosphere as a meteor, and its discovery and impact prediction were considered a "remarkable feat" considering its small four meter size.&lt;ref name="Roylance2008" /&gt; The asteroid was identified about 19 hours before impact by [[Richard A. Kowalski|Richard Kowalski]] of the [[Catalina Sky Survey]] near Tucson, Arizona, in the United States.&lt;ref name="Williams-2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jplneo" /&gt; Although officials in the U.S. Government were advised of the impending impact, no warning was provided to the Sudanese Government. According to Donald Yeomans, head of NASA's Near Earth Objects Program at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], "NASA alerted the White House, the National Security Council, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the Department of Homeland Security... But no one from the United States alerted Sudan because the two countries did not have diplomatic relations".&lt;ref name="Christian Science Monitor-2013.02.16"&gt;Spotts, Pete.

Retrieved August 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

|group="Note"|}}

At the presentation, alongside former NASA astronauts [[B612 Foundation#Tom Jones, Strategic Adviser|Dr. Tom Jones]] and [[Apollo 8]] astronaut [[William Anders|Bill Anders]],&lt;ref name="Aviation Week-2014.04.23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B612-Impact video media release 2014.04.17" /&gt; Foundation head [[Ed Lu]] explained that the frequency of dangerous [[impact event|asteroid impacts]] hitting Earth was from three to ten times greater than previously believed a dozen or so years ago (earlier estimates had pegged the odds as one per 300,000 years).&lt;ref name="Atlantic-2008.06.01" /&gt;  The latest reassessment is based on worldwide [[infrasound]] signatures recorded under the auspices of the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]], which monitors the planet for nuclear explosions.  Dr.  Brown's UWO study used infrasound signals generated by asteroids that released more than a kiloton of TNT explosive force. The study suggested that "city-killer" type impact events similar to the [[Tunguska event]] of 1908 actually occur on average about once a century instead of every thousand years, as was once previously believed. The 1908 event occurred in the remote, sparsely populated [[Podkamennaya Tunguska River|Tunguska area]] of [[Siberia]], Russia, and is attributed to the likely airburst explosion of an asteroid or comet that destroyed some 80 million trees over 2,150 square kilometres (830 sq mi) of forests. The higher frequency of these types of events is interpreted as meaning that "blind luck" has mainly prevented a catastrophic impact over an inhabited area that could kill millions, a point made near the video's end.&lt;ref name="Christian Science Monitor-2014.04.23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aviation Week-2014.04.23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B612-impact video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC Nightly News-2014.04.22" /&gt;

=== 99942 Apophis ===
During the first decade of the 2000s, there were serious concerns the 325 metres (1,066&amp;nbsp;ft) wide asteroid [[99942 Apophis]] posed a risk of impacting Earth in 2036. Preliminary, incomplete data by astronomers using ground-based sky surveys resulted in the calculation of a Level 4 risk on the [[Torino Scale|Torino Scale impact hazard chart]]. In July 2005, B612 formally asked NASA to investigate the possibility that the asteroid's post-2029 orbit could be in [[orbital resonance]] with Earth, which would increase the likelihood of a future impact. The Foundation also asked NASA to investigate whether a [[transponder]] should be placed on the asteroid to enable more accurate tracking of how its orbit would be changed by the [[Yarkovsky effect]].&lt;ref name="Morrison-2005" /&gt;

By 2008, B612 had provided estimates on a 30 kilometers-wide corridor, called a "path of risk", that would extend across the Earth's surface if an impact were to occur, as part of its effort to develop viable [[Asteroid deflection strategies|deflection strategies]].&lt;ref name="Schweickart et al-2006" /&gt; The calculated risk-path extended from [[Kazakhstan]] across southern Russia through Siberia, across the Pacific, then right between [[Nicaragua]] and [[Costa Rica]], crossing northern [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]], and ending in the Atlantic just before reaching Africa.&lt;ref name="Gennery-2007" /&gt; At that time, a computer simulation estimated Apophis's hypothetical impact in countries, such as Colombia and Venezuela, could have resulted in more than 10 million casualties.&lt;ref name="Baileya-2006" /&gt; Alternately, an impact in the Atlantic or Pacific oceans could produce a deadly [[tsunami]] over 240 metres (about 800&amp;nbsp;ft) in height, capable of destroying many coastal areas and cities.&lt;ref name="Popular Mechanics-2006.12" /&gt;

A series of later, more accurate observations of 99942 Apophis, combined with the recovery of previously unseen data, revised the odds of a collision in 2036 as being virtually nil, and effectively ruled it out.&lt;ref name="Farnocchia" /&gt;

=== International involvement ===
B612 Foundation members assisted the [[Association of Space Explorers]] (ASE) in helping obtain United Nations (UN) oversight of NEO tracking and deflection missions through the UN's [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space|Committee On the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]] (UN COPUOS) along with COPUOS's Action Team 14 (AT-14) expert group. Several members of B612, also members of the ASE, worked with COPUOS since 2001 to establish international involvement for both impact disaster responses, and on deflection missions to prevent impact events.&lt;ref name="Earth &amp; Sky-2013.10.28" /&gt; According to Foundation ''Chair Emeritus'' Rusty Schweickart in 2013, "No government in the world today has explicitly assigned the responsibility for planetary protection to any of its agencies".&lt;ref name="Discovery.com-2013.10.28" /&gt;

In October 2013, COPUOS's Scientific and Technical Subcommittee approved several measures,&lt;ref name="NPR-2013.11.03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlantic-2014.08.09" /&gt; later approved by the UN General Assembly in December,&lt;ref name="ESA-2014.08.10" /&gt; to deal with terrestrial asteroid impacts, including the creation of an International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) plus two advisory groups: the Space Missions Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG), and the Impact Disaster Planning Advisory Group (IDPAG).&lt;ref name="UNOOSA-press-2013.02.20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Air &amp; Space-2013.02.21" /&gt; The IAWN warning network will act as a clearinghouse for shared information on dangerous asteroids and for any future terrestrial impact events that are identified. The Space Missions Planning Advisory Group will coordinate joint studies of the technologies for deflection missions,&lt;ref name="Telegraph-2013.10.30" /&gt; and as well provide oversight of actual missions. This is due to deflection missions typically involving a progressive movement of an asteroid's predicted impact point across the surface of the Earth (and also across the territories of uninvolved countries) until the NEO is deflected either ahead of, or behind the planet at the point their orbits intersect.&lt;ref name="NPR-2013.11.03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New Scientist-2013.10.28" /&gt; An initial framework of international cooperation at the UN is needed, said Schweickart, to guide the policymakers of its member nations on several important NEO-related aspects. However, as asserted by the Foundation, the new UN measures only constitute a starting point. To be effective they will need to be enhanced by further policies and resources implemented at both the national and supernational levels.&lt;ref name="New York Times-2013.11.06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times-2013.10.28" /&gt;

At the time of the UN's policy adoption in New York City, Schweickart and four other ASE members, including B612 head [[Ed Lu]] and strategic advisers [[Dumitru Prunariu]] and [[Thomas David Jones|Tom Jones]] participated in a public forum moderated by [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] not far from the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations Headquarters]]. The panel urged the global community to adopt further important steps for planetary defense against NEO impacts. Their recommendations included:&lt;ref name="Earth &amp; Sky-2013.10.28" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times-2013.10.28" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC News-2013.10.25" /&gt;
* UN delegates briefing their home countries' policymakers on the UN's newest roles;
* having each country's government create detailed asteroid disaster response plans, assigning fiscal resources to deal with asteroid impacts, and delegating a lead agency to handle its disaster response in order to create clear lines of communication from the IAWN to the affected countries;
* having their governments support the ASE's and B612's efforts to identify the estimated one million "city-killer" NEOs capable of impacting Earth,&lt;ref name="Discovery.com-2013.10.28" /&gt; by deploying a [[Space observatory|space-based asteroid telescope]], and
* committing member states to launching an international test deflection mission within 10 years.

== Sentinel Mission ==
{{Main|Sentinel Space Telescope}}
[[File:Sentinel Space Telescope illustration.jpg|thumb|A depiction of the [[Sentinel (space telescope)|Sentinel Space Telescope]], planned to be built by [[Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies|Ball Aerospace]]]]
The [[Sentinel (space telescope)|Sentinel Mission]] program was the cornerstone of the B612 Foundation's earlier efforts, with its [[preliminary design review|preliminary design]] and [[Systems architecture|system architecture level]] reviews planned for 2014,&lt;ref name="Aviation Week-2013.04.09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aviation Week-2014.04.23" /&gt; and its [[Design review (U.S. government)|critical design review]] to be conducted in 2015.&lt;ref name="Aviation Week-2013.04.09" /&gt; The [[infrared telescope]] would be launched atop a [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9]] rocket, to be placed into a [[Venus]]-trailing [[Heliocentric orbit]] around the Sun. Orbiting between the Sun and Earth, the Sun's rays would always be behind the telescope's lens and thus never inhibit the [[space observatory]]'s ability to detect asteroids or other [[near-Earth object]]s (NEOs).&lt;ref name="Atlantic-2008.06.01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B612-Impact video" /&gt; From the vantage of its inner-solar system orbit around the Sun, Sentinel would be able to "pick up objects that are currently difficult, if not impossible, to see in advance from Earth",&lt;ref name="Aviation Week-2013.04.09" /&gt; such as occurred with the [[Chelyabinsk meteor]] of 2013 that went undetected until its explosion over [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]], [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="New York Times-2013.03.20" /&gt; The Sentinel Mission was planned to provide an accurate dynamic catalog of asteroids and other NEOs made available to scientists worldwide from the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s [[Minor Planet Center]], the data collected would calculate the risk of [[impact events]] with our planet, allowing for asteroid deflection by the use of [[gravity tractor]]s to divert their trajectories away from Earth.&lt;ref name="Discover-2013.10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B612-2002" /&gt;

In order to communicate with the spacecraft while it is orbiting the Sun (at about the same distance as Venus), which can be at times as far as 270 million kilometres (170 million miles) from Earth, the B612 Foundation entered into a [[Space Act Agreement]] with NASA for the use of their [[Deep Space Network|deep space telecommunication network]].&lt;ref name="Aviation Week-2014.04.23" /&gt;

=== Design and operation ===
Sentinel was designed to perform continuous observation and analysis during its planned {{frac|6|1|2}}-year operational life,&lt;ref name="B612 Factsheet-2" /&gt; although B612 anticipates it may continue to function for up to 10 years.  Using its {{convert|51|cm}} telescope mirror with sensors built by [[Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies|Ball Aerospace]] (makers of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]'s instruments),&lt;ref name="New York Times-2013.02.16" /&gt; its mission would be to catalog 90% of asteroids with diameters larger than {{convert|140|m}}. There were also plans to catalog smaller Solar System objects as well.&lt;ref name="Discover-2013.09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B612-Sentinel Mission" /&gt;

The [[space observatory]] would measure {{convert|7.7|m}} by {{convert|3.2|m}} with a mass of {{convert|1500|kg}} and would orbit the Sun at a distance of {{convert|0.6|to|0.8|AU|}} approximately the same orbital distance as [[Venus (planet)|Venus]], employing [[infrared astronomy]] to identify asteroids against the [[Space environment|cold]] of outer space. Sentinel would scan in the 7- to 15-micron [[wavelength]] band across a 5.5 by 2-degree field of view. Its sensor array would consist of 16 detectors with coverage scanning "a 200-degree, full-angle field of regard".&lt;ref name="Aviation Week-2013.04.09" /&gt; B612, working in partnership with Ball Aerospace, was constructing Sentinel's 51&amp;nbsp;cm aluminum mirror, designed for a large field of view with its infrared sensors cooled to {{convert|40|K|C|lk=on}} using Ball's two-stage, [[Stirling-cycle|closed-Stirling-cycle]] [[cryocooler]].&lt;ref name="Ball Aerospace-2013" /&gt;

B612 aimed to produce its space telescope at a significantly lower cost than traditional space science programs by making use of space hardware systems previously developed for earlier programs, rather than designing a brand new observatory. Schweickart stated that about  "80% of what we're dealing with in Sentinel is [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]], 15% [[Spitzer Space Telescope|Spitzer]], 5% new, higher-performance [[Thermographic camera|infrared sensors]]", thus concentrating its R&amp;D funds on the critical area of cryogenically-cooled image sensor technology, producing what it terms will be the most sensitive type of asteroid-finding telescope ever built.&lt;ref name="Discover-2013.09" /&gt;

Data gathered by Sentinel would be provided through existing scientific data-sharing networks that include [[NASA]] and academic institutions such as the [[Minor Planet Center]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Given the satellite's telescopic accuracy, Sentinel's data may have proven valuable for other possible future missions, such as [[asteroid mining]].&lt;ref name="New York Times-2013.02.16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B612-Sentinel Mission" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Space.com-2012.07.10" /&gt;

=== Mission funding ===
B612 was attempting to raise approximately $450M to fund the development, launch and operational costs of the telescope,&lt;ref name="Aviation Week-2013.04.09" /&gt; about the cost of a complex [[Controlled-access highway|freeway]] [[Stack interchange#Five-level stack|interchange]], or approximately $100M less than a single Air Force [[Next-Generation Bomber]].&lt;ref name="California-2014.06" /&gt; The $450 million cost estimate is composed of $250 million to create Sentinel, plus another $200 million for 10 years of operations.&lt;ref name="New York Times-2013.11.06" /&gt; In explaining the Foundation's bypassing of possible governmental grants for such a mission,&lt;ref name="New York Times-2013.03.20" /&gt; Dr. Lu stated their public fundraising appeal is being driven by "[t]he tragedy of the commons: When it's everybody's problem, it's nobody's problem", referring to a lack of ownership, priority and funding that governments have assigned to asteroid threats,&lt;ref name="Atlantic-2008.06.01" /&gt; also stating on a different occasion "We're the only ones taking it seriously."&lt;ref name="California-2014.06" /&gt; According to another B612 board member, Rusty Schweickart,  "The good news is, you can prevent it — not just get ready for it! The bad news is, it's hard to get anybody to pay attention to it when there are potholes in the road."&lt;ref name="New York Times-2011.03.13" /&gt; After providing earlier Congressional testimony on the issue Schweickart was dismayed to hear from congressional staff members that, while [[United States congressional hearing|U.S. lawmakers involved in the hearing]] understood the seriousness of the threat, they would likely not legislate funding for planetary defense as "making the deflection of asteroids a priority might backfire in [their] reelection campaigns".&lt;ref name="New York Times-2008.06.30" /&gt;

The Foundation intended to launch Sentinel in 2017–2018,&lt;ref name="B612-Impact video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific American-2013.10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miami Herald-2014.06.15" /&gt; with initiation of data transfer for on-[[Earth]] processing anticipated no later than 6 months afterwards.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="B612 Factsheet" /&gt;  [ed. note: document no longer available -Z]  --&gt;

In the aftermath of the February 2013 [[Chelyabinsk meteor|Chelyabinsk meteor explosion]]—where an approximate {{convert|20|m}} asteroid entered the atmosphere undetected at about [[Mach number|Mach 60]], becoming a brilliant [[superbolide]] [[meteor]] before exploding over Chelyabinsk, Russia&lt;ref name="New York Times-2013.03.20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-2013.02.15" /&gt; —the B612 foundation experienced a "surge of interest" in its project to detect asteroids, with a corresponding increase in funding donations.&lt;ref name="Denver Business Journal-2013.04.09" /&gt; After providing Congressional testimony Dr. Lu noted that the many online videos recorded of the asteroid's explosion over Chelyabinsk made a significant impact on millions of viewers worldwide, saying "There's nothing like a hundred YouTube videos to do that."&lt;ref name="New York Times-2013.03.25" /&gt;

== Deflection methods ==
{{Main|Asteroid impact avoidance#Collision avoidance strategies|l1=Asteroid impact avoidance –Collision avoidance strategies}}
A number of methods have been devised to 'deflect' an asteroid or other NEO away from an Earth-impacting trajectory, so that it can entirely avoid entering the Earth's atmosphere.  Given sufficient advance lead time, a change to the body's velocity of as little as one centimetre per second will allow it to avoid hitting the Earth.&lt;ref name="Scientific American-2003.11" /&gt;  Proposed and experimental deflection methods include [[Ion Beam Shepherd|ion beam shepherds]], focused [[solar energy]] and the use of [[mass driver]]s or [[solar sail]]s.

Initiating a [[nuclear explosive]] device above, on, or slightly beneath, the surface of a threatening NEO is a potential deflection option, with the optimal detonation height dependent upon the NEO's composition and size.  In the case of a threatening "rubble pile", the stand off, or detonation height above the surface configuration has been put forth as a means to prevent the potential fracturing of the rubble pile.&lt;ref name="Physics.nist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FlightGlobal-2007.08.03" /&gt; However, given sufficient advance warning of an asteroid's impact, most scientists avoid endorsing explosive deflection due to the number of potential issues involved.&lt;ref name="NPR-2005.11.10" /&gt; Other methods that can accomplish NEO deflections include:

=== Gravity tractor ===
{{main|Gravity tractor}}
An alternative to an explosive deflection is to move a dangerous asteroid slowly and consistently over time. The effect of a tiny constant thrust can accumulate to deviate an object sufficiently from its predicted course. In 2005 Drs. [[Ed Lu]] and [[Stanley G. Love]] proposed using a large, heavy unmanned spacecraft hovering over an asteroid to gravitationally pull the latter into a non-threatening orbit. The method will function due to the spacecraft's and asteroid's mutually [[Gravitation|gravitational attraction]].&lt;ref name="NPR-2005.11.10" /&gt; When the spacecraft counters the gravitational attraction towards the asteroid by the use of, for example, an [[nuclear electric rocket|ion thruster engine]], the net effect is that the asteroid is accelerated, or moved, towards the spacecraft and thus slowly deflected from the orbital path that will lead it to a collision with Earth.&lt;ref name="BBC News-2012.01.20" /&gt;

While slow, this method has the advantage of working irrespective of an asteroid's composition.  It would even be effective on a [[comet]], loose [[rubble pile]], or an object spinning at a high rate.  However, a gravity tractor would likely have to spend several years stationed beside and tugging on the body to be effective. The [[Sentinel Space Telescope]]'s mission is designed to provide the required advance lead time.

According to Rusty Schweickart, the [[gravitational tractor]] method also has a controversial aspect because during the process of changing an asteroid's trajectory, the point on Earth where it would most likely hit would slowly be shifted temporarily across the face of the planet. It means the threat for the entire planet might be minimized at a temporary cost of some specific states' security. Schweickart recognizes that choosing the manner and direction the asteroid should be "dragged" may be a difficult international decision, and one that should be made through the United Nations.&lt;ref name="Wired-2009.12" /&gt;

An early [[NASA]] analysis of deflection alternatives in 2007, stated: "'Slow push' mitigation techniques are the most expensive, have the lowest level of technical readiness, and their ability to both travel to and divert a threatening NEO would be limited unless mission durations of many years to decades are possible."&lt;ref name="NASA-Deflection Analysis" /&gt; But a year later in 2008 the B612 Foundation released a technical evaluation of the gravity tractor concept, produced on contract to NASA.  Their report confirmed that a transponder-equipped tractor  "with a simple and robust spacecraft design" can provide the needed towing service for a 140-meters-diameter equivalent, Hayabusa-shaped asteroid or other NEO.&lt;ref name="B612-Gravity Tractor Report" /&gt;

=== Kinetic impact ===
[[File:Art1 deepimpact.jpg|thumb|An artist's rendering of NASA's [[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|Deep Impact]] spacecraft next to [[Tempel 1|Comet Tempel 1]]]]
[[File:Deep Impact HRI.jpeg|thumb|Deep Impact being crashed into Comet Tempel 1 in July 2005 (photographed from a companion spacecraft), an example of a technique that can alter a NEO's trajectory.]]
:''See also: [[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|Deep Impact]], [[Lightweight Exo-Atmospheric Projectile]] and [[AIDA (spacecraft)|AIDA]].''
When the asteroid is still far from Earth, a means of deflecting the asteroid is to directly alter its [[momentum]] by colliding a spacecraft with the asteroid. The further away from the Earth, the smaller the required impact force becomes.  Conversely, the closer a dangerous [[near-Earth Object]] (NEO) is to Earth at the time of its discovery, the greater the force that is required to make it deviate from its collision trajectory with the Earth.  Closer to Earth, the impact of a massive spacecraft is a possible solution to a pending NEO impact.

In 2005, in the wake of the successful U.S. mission that crashed its [[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|Deep Impact]] probe into [[Tempel 1|Comet Tempel 1]], China announced its plan for a more advanced version: the landing of a spacecraft probe on a small NEO in order to push it off course.&lt;ref name="Economic Times-2005.07.07" /&gt; In the 2000s the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) began studying the design of a space mission named [[Don Quijote (space probe)|Don Quijote]], which, if flown, would have been the first intentional asteroid deflection mission ever designed. ESA's [[Advanced Concepts Team]] also demonstrated theoretically that a deflection of [[99942 Apophis]] could be achieved by sending a spacecraft weighing less than a tonne to impact against the asteroid.

ESA had originally identified two NEOs as possible targets for its Quijote mission: {{mpl|2002 AT|4}} and [[(10302) 1989 ML]].&lt;ref name="ESA.int-Don Quijote" /&gt; Neither asteroid represents a threat to Earth. In a subsequent study, two different possibilities were selected: the [[Amor asteroid]] [[2003 SM84]] and [[99942 Apophis]]; the latter is of particular significance to Earth as it will make a close approach in 2029 and 2036. In 2005, ESA announced at the 44th annual [[Lunar and Planetary Science Conference]] that its mission would be combined into a joint ESA-NASA [[AIDA (spacecraft)|Asteroid Impact &amp; Deflection Assessment]] (AIDA) mission, proposed for 2019–2022. The target selected for AIDA will be a [[binary asteroid]], so that the deflection effect could also be observed from Earth by timing the rotation period of the binary pair.&lt;ref name="BBC News-2012.01.20" /&gt; AIDA's new target, a component of binary asteroid [[65803 Didymos]], will be impacted at a velocity of 22,530&amp;nbsp;km/h (14,000&amp;nbsp;mph)&lt;ref name="ESA.int-AIDA study" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ESA.int-NEO.2013.01.15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huffington Post-2013.03.25" /&gt;

A [[NASA]] analysis of deflection alternatives, conducted in 2007, stated: "Non-nuclear kinetic impactors are the [[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|most mature approach]] and could be used in some deflection/mitigation scenarios, especially for NEOs that consist of a single small, solid body."&lt;ref name="NASA-Deflection Analysis" /&gt;

== Funding status ==
The B612 Foundation is a California [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit, private foundation. Financial contributions to the B612 Foundation are tax-exempt in the United States.  Its principal offices are in [[Mountain View, California]];&lt;ref name="B612-TF" /&gt; they were previously located in [[Tiburon, California]].&lt;ref name="Mone" /&gt;

Fund raising has not gone well for B612 as of June 2015.  With an overall goal to raise {{USD|450 million}} for the project, the foundation raised only approximately {{USD|1.2 million}} in 2012 and {{USD|1.6 million}} in 2013.&lt;ref name=nature20150619&gt;

== Foundation name ==
{{Main|The Little Prince}}
The B612 Foundation is named in tribute to the home asteroid of the [[eponym]]ous hero of [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]'s best-selling philosophical fable of ''Le Petit Prince'' (''[[The Little Prince]]'').&lt;ref name="NPR-2005.11.10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Institute for Advanced Study-Piet Hut" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Discover-2013.09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pacific Sun-2004.07.07" /&gt; In aviation's early pioneer years of the 1920s, Saint-Exupéry made an emergency landing on top of an African [[mesa]] covered with crushed white limestone seashells.  Walking around in the moonlight he kicked a black rock and soon deduced it was a meteorite that had fallen from space.&lt;ref name="Post Road Magazine-Iss.8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times-2014.06.21" /&gt;

That experience later contributed, in 1943, to his literary creation of Asteroid B-612&lt;!-- do not wikilink: now goes to an Australian hard rock band --&gt; in his philosophical fable of a little prince fallen to Earth,&lt;ref name="New York Times-2014.06.21" /&gt; with the home [[Minor planet|planetoid]]'s name having been adapted from one of the mail planes Saint-Exupéry once flew, bearing the registration marking A-612.

Also inspired by the story is an asteroid discovered in 1993, though not identified as posing any threat to Earth, named ''[[46610 Bésixdouze]]'' (the numerical part of its designation represented in [[hexadecimal]] as 'B612', while the textual part is French for "B six twelve"). As well, a small [[Minor-planet moon|asteroid moon]], [[Petit-Prince (moon)|''Petit-Prince'']], discovered in 1998 is named in part after ''The Little Prince''.&lt;ref name="B612-Bésixdouze" /&gt;&lt;ref name="William" /&gt;

'''Bede Griffiths''' [[Camaldolese|OSB Cam]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osb.org/new/2001-2005/0504new.html Order of St Benedict website]&lt;/ref&gt; (17 December 1906 – 13 May 1993), born '''Alan Richard Griffiths''' and also known by the end of his life as '''Swami Dayananda''' ("bliss of compassion"), was a British-born [[Benedictine]] [[monk]] and priest who lived in [[ashram]]s in South India and became a noted [[yogi]]. He became a leading thinker in the development of the dialogue between Christianity and [[Hinduism]]. Griffiths was a part of the [[Christian Ashram Movement]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Griffiths was born in [[Walton-on-Thames]], Surrey, England, at the end of 1906, the youngest of three children of a middle-class family. Shortly after Griffiths' birth, his father was betrayed by a business partner and was left penniless. His mother took the children and established residence in a smaller home which she maintained, though she had to find work to support herself and the children. At age 12, Griffiths was sent to [[Christ's Hospital]], a school for poor boys.&lt;ref name="Bede"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fastiggi|first1=Robert|last2=Pereira|first2=Jose|title=The Sawmi from Oxford|url=http://www.bedegriffiths.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/The-Swami-from-Oxford.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2017|work=Crisis|issue=March 1991|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students of this school were nicknamed "bluecoats". He excelled in his studies and earned a scholarship to the [[University of Oxford]] where, in 1925, he began his studies in English literature and philosophy at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]]. In his third year at university he came under the tutelage of [[C. S. Lewis]], who became a lifelong friend. Griffiths graduated from Oxford in 1929 with a degree in journalism.

Shortly after graduation Griffiths, with fellow Oxford alumni [[Martyn Skinner]] and Hugh Waterman, settled in a cottage in the [[Cotswold]]s and began what they called an "experiment in common living".&lt;ref&gt;The golden string. 1954&lt;/ref&gt; They followed a lifestyle attuned to nature, milking cows and selling the milk to support themselves. They would read the Bible together as a form of literature. Griffiths noted a strong connection between the teachings of [[Scripture]] and the rhythm of the nature around them. The experiment lasted less than a year, as one of the friends found the life too demanding. Nevertheless, the experience had a strong effect on Griffiths.

As a result of this experience, Griffiths decided to seek [[Holy Orders]] in the [[Church of England]]. He was advised, however, to gain some experience in the slums of London. This advice was so contrary to what Griffiths felt to be his [[vocation]] that it drove him to a crisis of faith, which nearly drove him to an emotional breakdown.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Guided by the writings of [[Cardinal Newman]], he reached a point in this struggle where he had a spiritual breakthrough. He recounts the story of his conversion in his autobiography ''The Golden String''.

In November 1931, Griffiths went to stay at the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] [[monastery]] of [[Prinknash Abbey]] where he was impressed by the life. Despite the strong anti-Roman Catholic sentiments of his mother, he was received into the Roman Catholic Church and made his [[First Communion]] at Christmas Eve [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] at the abbey.

===Benedictine monastic life===
Griffiths was received by the abbey as a [[postulant]] a month after his reception into the Catholic Church. On 29 December 1932, he entered the [[novitiate]] and was given the monastic name of "Bede". He made his solemn [[profession]] in 1937 (a year before the death of his mother in a car accident) and was [[ordained]] to the [[Catholic priesthood]] in 1940.

In 1947 the abbey sent a group of 25 monks to give support to two monasteries in the United Kingdom which had been founded by monks from France. Griffiths was chosen to be the [[prior|obedientiary prior]] for the monastery at [[St Michael's Abbey, Farnborough|Farnborough]] in Hampshire. He led that house for four years, but was unable to generate sufficient financial support to keep the community going. The abbot then sent him to the other monastery, [[Pluscarden Abbey]] in Scotland. It was there that he wrote his autobiography.

During Griffiths' time at Farnborough, he had come to know Father Benedict Alapatt, a European-born monk of Indian descent who was greatly interested in establishing a monastery in his homeland. Griffiths had already been introduced to Eastern thought, [[yoga]] and the [[Vedas]] and took interest in this proposed project. The abbot at first refused permission, but later changed his mind and authorised Griffiths to go to India with the Indian member of the community. There was one condition, though: Griffiths was not to be there as a member of the abbey, but as a priest subject to a local bishop, which meant that he would be giving up his vows.

===Christian yogi===
After some painful inner debate, Griffiths agreed to this and, in 1955, he embarked for India with Alapatt. At the time, he wrote to a friend: "I am going to discover the other half of my soul."{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} After arriving and visiting some spiritual centres in the country, they settled in [[Kengeri]] in [[Bangalore, India|Bangalore]], considered{{by whom|date=November 2011}} the garden spot of India, with the goal of building a monastery there. That project was eventually unsuccessful as Griffiths left the location in 1958, saying that he found it "too Western".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Man, monk, mystic|first=Sister Pascaline, OSB|last=Coff|work=The Bede Griffiths Trust|url=http://www.bedegriffiths.com/bede-griffiths/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffiths then joined with a [[Belgian people|Belgian]] monk, Father [[Francis Acharya]], [[Trappists|OCSO]], to establish [[Kristiya Sanyasa Samaj,Kurisumala Ashram|Kristiya Sanyasa Samaj, Kurisumala Ashram]] ("Mountain of the Cross"), a [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Rite]] monastery of the [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]] in Kerala. They sought to develop a form of monastic life based in the Indian tradition, adopting the [[saffron]] garments of an Indian ''[[sannyasi]]'' (an [[ascetic]] or monk). At that point, Griffiths took the [[Sanskrit]] name "'''Dayananda'''" ("bliss of compassion"). During that time he continued his studies in the religions and cultures of India, writing ''Christ in India'' while there. He also visited the United States during the period, giving a number of talks about East–West dialogue and being interviewed by [[CBS]] television.

Later, in 1968, Griffiths moved to the [[Saccidananda Ashram]] (also known as ''Shantivanam''; [[Tamil language|Tamil]] for "forest of peace") in [[Tamil Nadu]], South India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bedegriffiths.com/ashrams/ |work=The Bede Griffiths Trust |title=Saccidananda Ashram |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613061415/http://www.bedegriffiths.com/ashrams/ |archivedate=13 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been founded in 1950 by the French Benedictine monk [[Abhishiktananda]] (Dom Henri Le&amp;nbsp;Saux, OSB), from the [[Abbey of Kergonan]], along with another Frenchman, the [[Abbé]] Jules Monchanin. The two had developed a religious lifestyle which was completely expressed in authentic Indian fashion, using English, Sanskrit and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] in their religious services. They had built the ashram buildings by hand in the style of the poor of the country. Monchanin had died in 1957 and Le&amp;nbsp;Saux wanted to devote himself to a [[hermit]]'s life. Griffiths came with two other monks to assume life there and to allow Le&amp;nbsp;Saux his wish.

Griffiths resumed his studies of Indian thought, trying to relate it to Christian theology. At this point, he became known as "'''Swami Dayananda'''" ("bliss of compassion"). He wrote 12 books on [[Hindu]]–Christian dialogue. During this period, Griffiths desired to reconnect himself with the Benedictine order and sought a monastic [[congregation (Catholic)|congregation]] which would accept him in the way of life he had developed over the decades. He was welcomed by the [[Camaldolese]] monks, and he and the ashram became a part of their congregation.

===Final years===
In January 1990, Griffiths suffered a stroke in his room at the ashram. A month later, to the day, he was declared healed. The following year, he began a period of extensive travel, making annual visits to the United States, then later to Europe, where he met the [[Dalai Lama]]. He noted to a friend, "I do believe that he liked me."&lt;ref&gt;"Bede Griffiths:Meeting the Dalai Lama" by  Meath Conlin on his website, Diverse Journeys, 22 June 2010 [http://diversejourneys.com/?p=1214]&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his journey, giving lectures in Germany and England. He arrived back at the ashram in October 1992, where an Australian film crew were awaiting him to make a documentary about his life, which was released as ''A Human Search''.

Three days after the completion of filming, on his 86th birthday, Griffiths had a major stroke. The following month, he had a further series of strokes. He died at Shantivanam on 13 May 1993, aged 86.

==Legacy==
The archives of the Bede Griffiths Trust are located at the [[Graduate Theological Union]] in [[Berkeley, California]]. His contributions are promoted and developed by the Bede Griffiths Trust and by the Camaldolese Institute for East–West Dialogue based at the American Camaldolese hermitage of [[New Camaldoli]], located in [[Big Sur]], California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedegriffiths.com/camaldolese-institute/ Bede Griffiths' Trust website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CellCognition''' is a free [[Open-source software|open-source]] computational framework for quantitative analysis of high-throughput [[Fluorescence microscope|fluorescence microscopy]] ([[Time-lapse microscopy|time-lapse]]) images in the field of [[bioimage informatics]] and systems microscopy. The CellCognition framework uses [[image processing]], [[computer vision]] and [[machine learning]] techniques for single-cell tracking and classification of cell morphologies. This enables measurements of temporal progression of cell phases, modeling of cellular dynamics and generation of [[phenotype]] map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Held M, Schmitz MH, Fischer B, Walter T, Neumann B, Olma MH, Peter M, Ellenberg J, Gerlich DW |title=CellCognition: time-resolved phenotype annotation in high-throughput live cell imaging |journal=Nature Methods |volume=7|issue=9 |pages=747–54 |year=2010 |pmid=20693996 |doi=10.1038/nmeth.1486}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmitz MH, Held M, Janssens V, Hutchins JR, Hudecz O, Ivanova E, Goris J, Trinkle-Mulcahy L, Lamond AI, Poser I, Hyman AA, Mechtler K, Peters JM, Gerlich DW |title=Live-cell imaging RNAi screen identifies PP2A-B55alpha and importin-beta1 as key mitotic exit regulators in human cells |journal=Nature Cell Biology |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=886–93 |year= 2010 |pmid=20711181 |doi=10.1038/ncb2092|pmc=3839080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
CellCognition uses a computational pipeline which includes image [[Segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]], [[object detection]], [[feature extraction]], [[statistical classification]], [[Video tracking|tracking]] of individual cells over time, detection of class-transition motifs (e.g. cells entering mitosis), and [[Hidden Markov model|HMM]] correction of classification errors on class labels.

The software is written in Python 2.7 and binaries are available for Windows and Mac OS X.

==History==
CellCognition (Version 1.0.1) was first released in December 2009 by scientists from the Gerlich Lab and the Buhmann group at the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich]] and the Ellenberg Lab at the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] Heidelberg. The latest release is 1.6.1 and the software is developed and maintained by the Gerlich Lab at the [[Institute of Molecular Biotechnology]].

==Application==

'''Clinical vampirism''', more commonly known as '''Renfield's syndrome''' or '''Renfield syndrome''', is an obsession with drinking [[blood]]. The earliest formal presentation of clinical vampirism to appear in the psychiatric literature, with the psychoanalytic interpretation of two cases, was contributed by Richard L. Vanden Bergh and John F. Kelley in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vanden Bergh|first=Richard L.|author2=Kelley, John F.|title=Vampirism -- A review with new observations|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|year=1964|volume=11|pages=543–547|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1964.01720290085012|pmid=14208658}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the authors point out, brief and sporadic reports of blood-drinking behaviors associated with sexual pleasure have appeared in the psychiatric literature at least since 1892 with the work of Austrian forensic psychiatrist [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]. Many medical publications concerning clinical vampirism can be found in the literature of forensic psychiatry, with the unusual behavior reported as one of many aspects of extraordinary violent crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hemphill|first=R.E.|author2=Zabow, T.|title=Clinical vampirism: A presentation of 3 cases and a reevaluation of Haigh, the "Acid-Bath Murderer"|journal=South African Medical Journal|year=1983|volume=63|pages=278–281.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jaffe|first=PD|author2=DiCataldo, F.|title=Clinical vampirism: blending myth and reality|journal=Bulletin of the American Academy of Psychiatry and Law|year=1994|volume=22|issue=4|pages=533–544}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramsland|first=Katharine|title=The Vampire Killers|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/vampires/1.html|publisher=Crime Library|accessdate=3 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210092523/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/vampires/1.html|archive-date=10 December 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The syndrome is named after [[Dracula]]'s human zoophagous follower, [[Renfield|R. M. Renfield]], in the 1897 novel by [[Bram Stoker]]. According to an interview conducted by psychology professor [[Katherine Ramsland]] with clinical psychologist [[Richard Noll]], who coined the eponymous term in a 1992 book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Richard Noll]] | title=Vampires, Werewolves and Demons: twentieth century reports in the psychiatric literature | publisher=Brunner/Mazel Publications | year=1992 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tVkfHgAACAAJ&amp;dq |isbn=0-87630-632-6}},https://www.academia.edu/6793535/Vampires_Werewolves_and_Demons_Twentieth_Century_Case_Reports_in_the_Psychiatric_Literature_1991_&lt;/ref&gt; he invented the term and its purported diagnostic criteria as a whimsical parody of the "new DSM-speak" of the psychiatry of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramsland|first=Katharine|title=Vampire Personality Disorder|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/shadow-boxing/201211/vampire-personality-disorder|publisher=Psychology Today (21 November 2012)|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a public lecture hosted by Penn State University's Institute for the Arts and Humanities on 7 October 2013, Noll traced the 20-year trajectory of his unintentionally created "monster" from the moment of its creation as a parody of DSM mental disorders to the cultural popularity of Renfield's syndrome today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Penn State University Institute for the Arts and Humanities|title=Events Schedule, October 2013|url=http://www.iah.psu.edu/archive/allevents.shtml|accessdate=10 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914194410/http://iah.psu.edu/archive/allevents.shtml|archive-date=14 September 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268278489_Renfield's_Syndrome_or_How_I_(Unintentionally)_Created_a_Monster?ev=prf_pub|title=Renfield's Syndrome, or, How I (Unintentionally) Created a Monster|website=ResearchGate|date=October 2013|author=Richard Noll|access-date=2017-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032407/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268278489_Renfield's_Syndrome_or_How_I_(Unintentionally)_Created_a_Monster?ev=prf_pub|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Noll's book appeared in the year 1992 clinical vampirism has usually been referred to as Renfield's syndrome. In an NBC pre-Halloween special hosted by actor Peter Graves entitled "The Unexplained: Witches, Werewolves and Vampires" that aired on 23 October 1994 (and is available on YouTube, with the 34:11 mark beginning the segment), pages from Noll's book were shown on camera as Canadian psychologist [[Leonard George]] summarized Renfield's syndrome for a wide television audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unexplained: Witches, Werewolves and Demons|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sQN7VpdX4s|publisher=You Tube|accessdate=2 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609000940/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sQN7VpdX4s|archive-date=9 June 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Elias|first=Thomas D.|title=Television: "The Unexplained" Just the Latest Chapter in Peter Graves' Career|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-10-22/entertainment/9410220048_1_show-business-strange-stories-fun|publisher=Chicago Tribune, 22 October 1994|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=22 October 1994|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610205331/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-10-22/entertainment/9410220048_1_show-business-strange-stories-fun|archive-date=10 June 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characters suffering from Renfield's Syndrome have appeared on television. The first appeared in a 2005 episode of ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' titled "Committed" (Season 5, Episode 21).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CSI:Committed |url=http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/episodes/520 |quote=Kenny Valdez is in the Seclusion Room, strapped to a bed in a five-point restraint system, claiming he can "smell it!"

In 2010 an 11-episode Canadian television series, ''The Renfield Syndrome'', was filmed in Vancouver, B.C., but does not seem to have been aired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Renfield Syndrome (2010)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1764036/|accessdate=1 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406092302/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1764036/|archive-date=6 April 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 August 2012 Renfield's syndrome was the subject of a video segment on ''The Huffington Post'' by Cara Santa Maria which again relied heavily on Noll's work and a recent scholarly article on the (pseudo-)syndrome published in the ''Journal of the History of the Neurosciences''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Santa Maria|first=Cara|authorlink=Cara Santa Maria|title=Renfield's Syndrome: A Mysterious Case of Real-Life Vampirism|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/15/renfields-syndrome-vampirism_n_1765799.html|publisher=The Huffington Post (15 August 2012)|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=15 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325171428/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/15/renfields-syndrome-vampirism_n_1765799.html|archive-date=25 March 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olry|first=Regis|author2=Duane E.

In addition to references to Renfield's syndrome in the psychiatric literature and mass media, the horror writer Chelsea Quinn Yarbro published a story entitled "Renfield's Syndrome" in July 2002, which was then reprinted in an anthology that appeared the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yarbro|first=chelsea Quinn|title=Apprehensions and Other Delusions|year=2003|publisher=Five Star|location=Waterville, Maine}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the title of a novel by J.A.

The twenty-year evolution of a farcical 3-page book section that shot through the mass media and then—uncritically—into the pages of a peer-reviewed scholarly journal should serve as a cautionary tale about the purported validity of other "mental disorders." Philosopher of science Ian Hacking refers to this process as "making up people" and critiques medical and psychiatric elites for the untoward effects of their "dynamic nominalism" on individual lives. Such arbitrary categories create new natural "kinds" of people (e.g., perverts, multiple personalities and so on) that serve larger political, cultural and moral purposes and change with historical contingencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hacking|first=Ian|title=Making Up People|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n16/ian-hacking/making-up-people|publisher=London Review of Books, 28 (16): 23-26, 17 August 2006|accessdate=3 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609150150/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n16/ian-hacking/making-up-people|archive-date=9 June 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hacking|first=Ian|title=Making Up People (full text)|url=http://generation-online.org/c/fcbiopolitics2.htm|accessdate=3 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306133122/http://www.generation-online.org/c/fcbiopolitics2.htm|archive-date=6 March 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the case history reports in the older psychiatric literature that formed the basis of Noll's parody, the condition starts with a key event in [[childhood]] that causes the experience of blood injury or the ingestion of blood to be exciting. After [[puberty]], the excitement is experienced as [[sexual arousal]]. Throughout [[adolescence]] and [[adulthood]], blood, its presence, and its consumption can also stimulate a sense of power and control. Noll speculated that Renfield's syndrome begins with [[autovampirism]] and then progresses to the consumption of the blood of other creatures.&lt;ref name=cl&gt;{{cite news |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |authorlink=Katherine Ramsland |title=Renfield's Syndrome |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/vampires/7.html |quote=Psychiatrists are aware that there exists a behavior known as "clinical vampirism," which is a syndrome involving the delusion of actually being a vampire and feeling the need for blood. This arises not from fiction and film but from the erotic attraction to blood and the idea that it conveys certain powers, although the actual manifestation of the fantasy may be influenced by fiction. It develops through fantasies involving sexual excitement. |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |accessdate=2007-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218202138/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/vampires/7.html |archive-date=2007-12-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usefulness of this diagnostic label remains in question.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Very few cases of the syndrome have been described, and the published reports that do exist refer to what has been proposed as Renfield's syndrome through the use of official psychiatric diagnostic categories such as [[schizophrenia]] or as a variety of [[paraphilia]].

== Psychiatric and forensic contexts ==
Very few cases of the syndrome have been described, and the published reports that do exist describe clinical vampirism as behaviors that are subsumed under more conventional psychiatric diagnostic categories such as [[schizophrenia]] or [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jensen|first=HM|author2=Poulsen, HD|title=Auto-vampirism in schizophrenia|journal=Nordic Journal of Psychiatry|year=2002|volume=56|issue=1|pages=47–48|doi=10.1080/08039480252803918}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A case of vampirism in Turkey reported in 2012 was discussed as an unusual feature of a patient diagnosed with [[dissociative identity disorder]] and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sakarya|first=Direne|title="Vampirism" in a case of dissociative identity disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder|journal=Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics|year=2012|volume=81|issue=5|pages=322–323|doi=10.1159/000335930|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not referencing the literature on Renfield's syndrome, two Irish psychiatrists surveyed the psychiatric literature on vampirism as evidence of a changing discourse in psychiatry from the narrative of case studies to the depersonalized discourse of checklist diagnostic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacSuibhne, Seamus|first=Seamus|author2=Kelly, Brendan d.|title=Vampirism as Mental Illness: Myth, Madness and the Loss of Meaning in Psychiatry|journal=Social History of Medicine|year=2010|volume=24|issue=2|pages=445–460|doi=10.1093/shm/hkq055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of murderers have performed seemingly vampiric rituals upon their victims. [[Serial killer]]s [[Peter Kürten]] and [[Richard Trenton Chase]] were both called "[[vampires]]" in the [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]s after they were discovered drinking the blood of the people they murdered.

{{no footnotes|date=May 2015}}
In [[astronomy|astronomical]] and [[geodesy|geodetic]] calculations, '''Cracovians''' are a clerical convenience introduced in the 1930s by [[Tadeusz Banachiewicz]] for solving systems of [[linear equation]]s by hand. Such systems can be written as ''Ax''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'' in [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] notation where ''x'' and ''b'' are column vectors and the evaluation of ''b'' requires the multiplication of the rows of ''A'' by the vector ''x''.

Cracovians introduced the idea of using the [[matrix transpose|transpose]] of ''A'', ''A''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;, and multiplying the columns of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; by the column ''x''. This amounts to the definition of a new type of [[matrix multiplication]] denoted here by '∧'. Thus ''x'' ∧ ''A''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Ax''. The Cracovian product of two matrices, say ''A'' and ''B'', is defined by ''A''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;''A'', where ''B''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; and ''A'' are assumed compatible for the common ([[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]]) type of matrix multiplication.  

Since (''AB'')&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;''A''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;, the products (''A''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''B'')&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''C'' and ''A''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;(''B''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''C'') will generally be different; thus, Cracovian multiplication is non-[[associativity|associative]]. Cracovians are an example of a [[quasigroup]].

Cracovians adopted a column-row convention for designating individual elements as opposed to the standard row-column convention of matrix analysis. This made manual multiplication easier, as one needed to follow two parallel columns (instead of a vertical column and a horizontal row in the matrix notation.) It also sped up computer calculations, because both factors' elements were used in a similar order, which was more compatible with the [[sequential access]] memory in computers of those times — mostly [[magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape memory]] and [[drum memory]]. Use of Cracovians in astronomy faded as computers with bigger [[random access memory]] came into general use. Any modern reference to them is in connection with their non-associative multiplication.

==Programming implementation==
In [[R programming language|R]] the desired effect can be achieved via the &lt;code&gt;crossprod()&lt;/code&gt; function. Specifically, the Cracovian product of matrices ''A'' and ''B'' can be obtained as &lt;code&gt;crossprod(B, A)&lt;/code&gt;.

Critical geography is one variant of&amp;nbsp;[[Critical theory|critical social science and humanities]]&amp;nbsp;that adopt&amp;nbsp;[[Karl Marx|Marx]]’s thesis to interpret and change the world. Fay (1987) defines contemporary critical science as the effort to understand the&amp;nbsp;[[oppression]]&amp;nbsp;in a society and use this understanding to promote societal change and liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Critical_social_science.html?id=5K98AAAAIAAJ|title=Critical social science: liberation and its limits|last=Fay|first=Brian|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1987|isbn=9780801494581|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agger (1998) identifies a number of features of critical social theory practiced in fields like geography, which include: a rejection of&amp;nbsp;[[positivism]]; an endorsement of the possibility of progress; a claim for the structural dynamics of&amp;nbsp;[[Social dominance theory|domination]]; an argument that dominance derived from forms of false consciousness, ideology, and myth; a faith in the agency of everyday change and self-transformation and an attendant rejection of&amp;nbsp;[[determinism]]; and a rejection of revolutionary expediency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Critical_Social_Theories.html?id=eB-B6XercZoC|title=Critical Social Theories: An Introduction|last=Agger|first=Ben|publisher=Avalon Publishing|year=1988|isbn=9780813321745|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Critical geography in the Anglo-American world rooted in the&amp;nbsp;'''radical geography'''&amp;nbsp;that emerged in the early 1970s. Peet (2000) provides an overview of the evolution of radical and critical geography.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peet|first=Richard|year=2000|title=Celebrating Thirty Years of Radical Geography|journal=Environment and Planning A|language=en|volume=32|issue=6|pages=951–953|doi=10.1068/a32202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, radical geographers tried to transform the scope of the discipline of geography by responding to the great issues of the time - civil rights, environmental pollution, and war. From the mid- to late-1970s saw ascending critiques of the&amp;nbsp;[[quantitative revolution]]&amp;nbsp;and the adoption of&amp;nbsp;[[Marxism|Marxist]]&amp;nbsp;approach. The 1980s is marked by fissures between humanistic, feminist and Marxist streams, and a reversal of structural excess. In the late 1980s, critical geography emerged and gradually became a self-identified field.

Although closely related, critical geography and radical geography are not interchangeable. Critical geography has two crucial departures from radical geography: (1) a rejection of the structural excess of&amp;nbsp;[[Marxism]], in accordance with the&amp;nbsp;[[Postmodernism|post-modern turn]]; and (2) an increasing interest in culture and&amp;nbsp;[[Social representation|representation]], in contrast to radical geography’s focus on the economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Peet (2000) notices a rapprochement between critical and radical geography after heated debate in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Nevertheless, Castree (2000) posits that critical and radical geography entail different commitments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He contends that the eclipse of radical geography indicates the professionalization and academicization of Left geography, and therefore worries about the loss of the "radical" tradition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Common themes ==
As a consequence of the&amp;nbsp;[[Postmodernism|post-modern turn]], critical geography doesn’t have a unified commitment. Hubbard, Kitchin, Bartley, and Fuller (2002) asserts that critical geography has a diverse&amp;nbsp;[[epistemology]],&amp;nbsp;[[ontology]], and&amp;nbsp;[[methodology]], and does not have a distinctive theoretical identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=71SvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=thinking+geographically#v=onepage&amp;q=thinking%20geographically&amp;f=false|title=Thinking Geographically: Space, Theory and Contemporary Human Geography|last=Hubbard|first=Phil|last2=Bartley|first2=Brendan|last3=Fuller|first3=Duncan|last4=Kitchin|first4=Rob|publisher=A&amp;C Black|year=2002|isbn=9780567259882|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Blomley (2006) identifies six common themes of critical geography,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blomley|first=Nicholas|year=2006|title=Uncritical critical geography?|journal=Progress in Human Geography|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=87–94|doi=10.1191/0309132506ph593pr}}&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing:
# '''A commitment to theory and a rejection of&amp;nbsp;[[empiricism]].'''&amp;nbsp;Critical geographers consciously deploy theories of some form, but they draw from a variety of theoretical wells, such as&amp;nbsp;[[political economy]],&amp;nbsp;[[governmentality]],&amp;nbsp;[[feminism]],&amp;nbsp;[[anti-racism]], and&amp;nbsp;[[anti-imperialism]].
# '''A commitment to reveal the processes that produce&amp;nbsp;[[Social inequality|inequalities]]'''. Critical geographers seek to unveil&amp;nbsp;[[Power (social and political)|power]], uncover&amp;nbsp;[[Social inequality|inequality]], expose resistance, and cultivate liberating politics and&amp;nbsp;[[social change]]s.
# '''An emphasis on&amp;nbsp;[[Social representation|representation]]&amp;nbsp;as a means of domination and resistance'''. A common focus of critical geography is to study how representations of space sustain power; or on the contrary, how representations of space can be used to challenge power.
# '''An optimistic faith in the power of critical scholarship'''. Critical geographers believe that scholarship can be used to resist the dominant representations, and scholar can undo power domination and free the oppressed. There exists an implicit confidence in the power of critical scholarship to reach the ignorant, and in the capacities of people to defeat alienation by means of reflexive self-education.
# '''A commitment to progressive practices'''. Critical geographers want to make a difference. They claim to be united with&amp;nbsp;[[social movement]]s&amp;nbsp;and activists with commitments to&amp;nbsp;[[social justice]]. The relationship between critical geography and&amp;nbsp;[[activism]]&amp;nbsp;has been much debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Radical_Theory_critical_Praxis.html?id=zGabDAEACAAJ|title=Radical Theory/critical Praxis: Making a Difference Beyond the Academy?|last=Fuller|first=Duncan|last2=Kitchin|first2=Rob|publisher=Praxis (e)Press|year=2004|isbn=9780973456103|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''An understanding of&amp;nbsp;[[space]]&amp;nbsp;as a critical tool.'''&amp;nbsp;Critical geographers pay special attention to how spatial arrangements and representations can be used to produce&amp;nbsp;[[oppression]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Social inequality|inequality]]. Critical geographers identify to varying degrees how space can be used as both a veil and tool of power.

== Critiques ==
A few important questions remain unsolved in critical geography.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first one is that there has been relatively limited discussion over the shared commitments of critical geographers, with a few exceptions such as Harvey (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Spaces_of_Hope.html?id=W00VHZg3u2MC|title=Spaces of Hope|last=Harvey|first=David|publisher=University of California Press|year=2000|isbn=9780520225787|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question such as "what are geographers critical of", and "to what end" needs to be answered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Barnes (2002) comments that critical geographers are better at providing explanatory diagnoses than offering anticipatory-utopian imaginations to reconfigure the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Trevor J.|year=2002|title=Critical notes on economic geography from an aging radical. Or radical notes on economic geography from a critical age|url=https://ojs.unbc.ca/index.php/acme/article/view/687|journal=ACME: An International Journal for Critical Geographies|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=8–14|issn=1492-9732|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second question concerns the institutionalization of critical geography. Even though critical geographers conceive themselves as rebels and outsiders, critical thinking has become prevalent in geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/arts/maps-and-chaps-7142744|title=Maps and Chaps|last=Byles|first=Jeff|date=2001-07-31|work=Village Voice|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical geography is now situated at the very heart of the discipline of geography.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some see institutionalization as a natural result of the analytical strength and insights of critical geography, while others fear that institutionalization has entailed cooperation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The question is whether critical geography still holds its commitment to political change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lastly, as critical geography is practiced across the world, the insights of critical geographers outside the Anglophone world should be better acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bialasiewicz|first=Luiza|year=2003|title=The Many Wor(l)ds of Difference and Dissent|journal=Antipode|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=14–23|doi=10.1111/1467-8330.00299|issn=1467-8330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, Mizuoka et al. (2005) offered an overview of Japanese critical geography praxis since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mizuoka|first=Fujio|last2=Mizuuchi|first2=Toshio|last3=Hisatake|first3=Tetsuya|last4=Tsutsumi|first4=Kenji|last5=Fujita|first5=Tetsushi|year=2005|title=The Critical Heritage of Japanese Geography: Its Tortured Trajectory for Eight Decades|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=453–473|doi=10.1068/d2204r}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, critical geography should also forge stronger linkage with critical scholars in other disciplines.

'''Development of the nervous system''' refers to the processes that generate, shape, and reshape the nervous system of animals, from the earliest stages of [[embryogenesis]] to adulthood.  The field of neural development draws on both [[neuroscience]] and [[developmental biology]] to describe and provide insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which complex [[nervous system]]s develop, from the [[nematode]] and [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] to [[mammals]]. Defects in neural development can lead to malformations and a wide variety of sensory, motor, and cognitive impairments, including [[holoprosencephaly]] and other [[neurological disorders]] such as [[Rett syndrome]], [[Down syndrome]] and [[intellectual disability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neural Tube Defects|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/neuraltubedefects.html|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of brain development==
The [[mammalian]] [[central nervous system]] (CNS) is derived from the [[ectoderm]]—the outermost tissue layer—of the embryo.  In the third week of human development the [[neuroectoderm]] appears and forms the [[neural plate]] along the dorsal side of the embryo.  The neural plate is the source of the majority of neurons and glial cells of the CNS.  A groove forms along the long axis of the neural plate and, by week four of development, the neural plate wraps in on itself to give rise to the [[neural tube]], which is filled with [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saladin|first=Kenneth|title=Anatomy &amp; Physiology The Unity of Form and Function|year=2011|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|isbn= 9780073378251|pages=514}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the embryo develops, the anterior part of the neural tube forms a series of bulges called vesicles, which become the primary anatomical regions of the brain: the [[forebrain]] ([[prosencephalon]]), [[midbrain]] ([[mesencephalon]]), and [[hindbrain]] ([[rhombencephalon]]).  These simple, early vesicles enlarge and further divide into the [[telencephalon]] (future [[cerebral cortex]] and [[basal ganglia]]), [[diencephalon]] (future [[thalamus]] and [[hypothalamus]]), [[mesencephalon]] (future [[Inferior colliculus|colliculi]]), [[metencephalon]] (future [[pons]] and [[cerebellum]]), and [[myelencephalon]] (future [[medulla oblongata|medulla]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Scott|title=Developmental Biology.|date=2013|publisher=Sinauer Associates Inc|isbn=978-1605351926|edition=Tenth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CSF-filled central chamber is continuous from the telencephalon to the spinal cord, and constitutes the developing [[ventricular system]] of the CNS.  Because the neural tube gives rise to the brain and spinal cord any mutations at this stage in development can lead to lethal deformities like [[anencephaly]] or lifelong disabilities like [[spina bifida]].  During this time, the walls of the neural tube contain [[neural stem cells]], which drive brain growth as they divide many times.  Gradually some of the cells stop dividing and differentiate into [[neurons]] and [[glial cells]], which are the main cellular components of the CNS. The newly generated neurons migrate to different parts of the developing brain to self-organize into different brain structures. Once the neurons have reached their regional positions, they extend [[axons]] and [[dendrites]], which allow them to communicate with other neurons via [[synapses]]. Synaptic communication between neurons leads to the establishment of functional neural circuits that mediate sensory and motor processing, and underlie behavior.&lt;ref name="Principles of neural science"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Eric R.| last1=Kandel|title=Principles of neural science|date=2006|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=Appleton and Lange|isbn=978-0071390118|edition=5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:development of nervous system.svg|thumbnail|750px|center|Flowchart of human brain development.]]

==Aspects==
Some landmarks of neural development include the birth and [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of [[neuron]]s from [[stem cells|stem cell]] precursors, the [[cellular migration|migration]] of immature neurons from their birthplaces in the embryo to their final positions, outgrowth of [[axon]]s and [[dendrite]]s from neurons, [[axon guidance|guidance]] of the motile [[growth cone]] through the embryo towards postsynaptic partners, the generation of [[synapse]]s between these axons and their postsynaptic partners, and finally the lifelong [[synaptic plasticity|changes]] in synapses, which are thought to underlie learning and memory.

Typically, these neurodevelopmental processes can be broadly divided into two classes: activity-independent mechanisms and activity-dependent mechanisms.  Activity-independent mechanisms are generally believed to occur as hardwired processes determined by genetic programs played out within individual neurons. These include [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]], [[cellular migration|migration]] and [[axon guidance]] to their initial target areas.  These processes are thought of as being independent of neural activity and sensory experience.   Once [[axon]]s reach their target areas, activity-dependent mechanisms come into play.  Although synapse formation is an activity-independent event, modification of synapses and synapse elimination requires neural activity.

Developmental neuroscience uses a variety of animal models including mice ''[[Mus musculus]]'', the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', the zebrafish ''[[Danio rerio]]'', ''[[Xenopus laevis]]'' tadpoles and the worm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', among others.

[[Myelination]], formation of the lipid myelin bilayer around neuronal axons, is a process that is essential for normal brain function. The myelin sheath provides insulation for the nerve impulse when communicating between neural systems. Without it, the impulse would be disrupted and the signal would not reach its target, thus impairing normal functioning. Because so much of brain development occurs in the prenatal stage and infancy, it is crucial that myelination, along with cortical development occur properly. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive technique used to investigate myelination and cortical maturation (the cortex is the outer layer of the brain composed of [[gray matter]]). Rather than showing the actual myelin, the MRI picks up on the myelin water fraction (MWF), a measure of myelin content. Multicomponent relaxometry (MCR) allow visualization and quantification of myelin content. MCR is also useful for tracking white matter maturation, which plays an important role in cognitive development. It has been discovered that in infancy, myelination occurs in a posterior-to-anterior pattern. Because there is little evidence of a relationship between myelination and cortical thickness, it was revealed that cortical thickness is independent of white matter MWF. This allows various aspects of the brain to grow simultaneously, leading to a more fully developed brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Croteau-Chonka|first1=Elise C. |last2=Dean |first2=Douglas C., III |last3=Remer |first3=Justin |last4=Dirks |first4=Holly |last5=O'Muircheartaigh |first5=Jonathan |last6=Deoni |first6=Sean C.L.|title=Examining the relationships between cortical maturation and white matter myelination throughout early childhoold|journal=NeuroImage|date=15 October 2015|volume=125|pages=413–421|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.10.038 |pmid=26499814 |pmc=4691410}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neural induction==
During early embryonic development the ectoderm becomes specified to give rise to the epidermis (skin) and the neural plate.  The conversion of undifferentiated ectoderm to neuro-ectoderm requires signals from the mesoderm.  At the onset of gastrulation presumptive mesodermal cells move through the dorsal blastopore  lip and form a layer in between the endoderm and the ectoderm.  These mesodermal cells that migrate along the dorsal midline give rise to a structure called the notochord.  Ectodermal cells overlying the notochord develop into the neural plate  in response to a diffusible signal produced by the notochord.  The remainder of the ectoderm gives rise to the epidermis (skin).  The ability of the mesoderm to convert the overlying ectoderm into neural tissue is called neural induction.

The neural plate folds outwards during the third week of gestation to form the [[neural groove]].  Beginning in the future neck region, the [[neural folds]] of this groove close to create the [[neural tube]].  The formation of the neural tube from the ectoderm is called neurulation. The ventral part of the neural tube is called the [[basal plate (neural tube)|basal plate]]; the dorsal part is called the [[alar plate]].  The hollow interior is called the [[neural canal]].  By the end of the fourth week of gestation, the open ends of the neural tube, called the neuropores, close off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Estomih Mtui |author2=Gregory Gruener |title=Clinical Neuroanatomy and Neuroscience  |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |pages=1 |year=2006 |isbn=1-4160-3445-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A transplanted blastopore lip can convert ectoderm into neural tissue and is said to have an inductive effect. Neural inducers are molecules that can induce the expression of neural genes in ectoderm explants without inducing mesodermal genes as well. Neural induction is often studied in xenopus embryos since they have a simple body pattern and there are good markers to distinguish between neural and non-neural tissue. Examples of neural inducers are the molecules [[Noggin (protein)|noggin]] and [[chordin]].

When embryonic ectodermal cells are cultured at low density in the absence of mesodermal cells they undergo neural differentiation (express neural genes), suggesting that neural differentiation is the default fate of ectodermal cells.  In explant cultures (which allow direct cell-cell interactions) the same cells differentiate into epidermis.  This is due to the action of [[BMP4]] (a [[TGF beta|TGF-β]]  family protein) that induces ectodermal cultures to differentiate into epidermis.  During neural induction, noggin and chordin are produced by the dorsal mesoderm (notochord) and diffuse into the overlying ectoderm to inhibit the activity of BMP4.  This inhibition of BMP4 causes the cells to differentiate into neural cells.  Inhibition of TGF-β  and BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) signaling can efficiently induce neural tissue from human [[pluripotent stem cells]],&lt;ref name="Chambers 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Regionalization==
Late in the fourth week, the superior part of the neural tube flexes at the level of the future midbrain&amp;mdash;the [[mesencephalon]].  Above the [[mesencephalon]] is the [[prosencephalon]] (future forebrain) and beneath it is the [[rhombencephalon]] (future hindbrain).

The [[optical vesicle]] (which eventually become the optic nerve, retina and iris) forms at the basal plate of the prosencephalon.  The alar plate of the prosencephalon expands to form the cerebral hemispheres (the [[telencephalon]]) whilst its basal plate becomes the [[diencephalon]].  Finally, the optic vesicle grows to form an optic outgrowth.

==Patterning of the nervous system==
In [[chordates]], dorsal ectoderm forms all neural tissue and the nervous system. Patterning occurs due to specific environmental conditions -  different concentrations of signaling molecules

===Dorsoventral axis===
The ventral half of the [[neural plate]] is controlled by the [[notochord]], which acts as the 'organiser'. The dorsal half is controlled by the [[ectoderm]] plate, which flanks either side of the neural plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jessell, Thomas M. |author2=Kandel, Eric R. |author3=Schwartz, James H. |title=Principles of neural science |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2000 |pages=|isbn=0838577016|edition=4th |chapter=Chapter 55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ectoderm follows a default pathway to become neural tissue. Evidence for this comes from single, cultured cells of ectoderm, which go on to form neural tissue. This is postulated to be because of a lack of [[Bone morphogenetic protein|BMP]]s, which are blocked by the organiser. The organiser may produce molecules such as [[follistatin]], [[noggin (protein)|noggin]] and [[chordin]] that inhibit BMPs.

The ventral neural tube is patterned by [[sonic hedgehog]] (Shh) from the notochord, which acts as the inducing tissue. Notochord-derived Shh signals to the [[floor plate]], and induces Shh expression in the floor plate.  Floor plate-derived Shh subsequently signals to other cells in the neural tube, and is essential for proper specification of ventral neuron progenitor domains.  Loss of Shh from the notochord and/or floor plate prevents proper specification of these progenitor domains.  Shh binds [[Patched1]], relieving Patched-mediated inhibition of [[Smoothened]], leading to activation of [[Gli]] family of transcription factors (Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3) [[transcription factors]].

In this context Shh acts as a [[morphogen]] - it induces cell differentiation dependent on its concentration. At low concentrations it forms ventral interneurones, at higher concentrations it induces motor neuron development, and at highest concentrations it induces floor plate differentiation. Failure of Shh-modulated differentiation causes holoprosencephaly.

The dorsal neural tube is patterned by BMPs from the epidermal ectoderm flanking the neural plate. These induce sensory interneurones by activating Sr/Thr kinases and altering [[SMAD (protein)|SMAD]] transcription factor levels.

===Rostrocaudal (Anteroposterior) axis===
Signals that control anteroposterior neural development include FGF and [[retinoic acid]], which act in the hindbrain and spinal cord.&lt;ref name="Duester"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duester |first1=G |title=Retinoic acid synthesis and signaling during early organogenesis |journal=Cell |volume=134 |issue=6 |pages=921–31 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18805086 |pmc=2632951 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2008.09.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hindbrain, for example, is patterned by [[Hox genes]], which are expressed in overlapping domains along the anteroposterior axis under the control of retinoic acid. The 3' genes in the Hox cluster are induced by retinoic acid in the hindbrain, whereas the 5' Hox genes are not induced by retinoic acid and are expressed more posteriorly in the spinal cord. Hoxb-1 is expressed in rhombomere 4 and gives rise to the [[facial nerve]]. Without this Hoxb-1 expression, a nerve similar to the [[trigeminal nerve]] arises.

==Neurogenesis==
[[Neurogenesis]] is the process by which neurons are generated from [[neural stem cells]] and [[progenitor cells]].  Neurons are 'post-mitotic', meaning that they will never divide again for the lifetime of the organism.&lt;ref name="Principles of neural science"/&gt;

==Neuronal migration== &lt;!--Neuronal migration redirects here--&gt;

Neuronal [[Cellular migration|migration]] is the method by which neurons travel from their origin or birthplace to their final position in the brain. There are several ways they can do this, e.g. by radial migration or tangential migration. This [http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v4/n2/extref/nn0201-143-S1.mpg time lapse] displays sequences of radial migration (also known as glial guidance) and somal translocation.&lt;ref name=Nadar1&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nadarajah B, Brunstrom J, Grutzendler J, Wong R, Pearlman A |title=Two modes of radial migration in early development of the cerebral cortex |journal=Nat Neurosci |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=143–50 |year=2001 |pmid=11175874 |doi=10.1038/83967 |url=http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v4/n2/full/nn0201_143.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radial migration===
Neuronal precursor cells proliferate in the [[ventricular zone]] of the developing [[neocortex]], where the principal neural stem cell is the [[radial glial cell]].  The first [[mitosis|postmitotic]] cells must leave the stem cell niche and migrate outward to form the preplate, which is destined to become [[Cajal-Retzius cells]] and [[subplate]] neurons. These cells do so by somal translocation. Neurons migrating with this mode of locomotion are bipolar and attach the leading edge of the process to the [[pia mater|pia]]. The [[soma (biology)|soma]] is then transported to the pial surface by [[nucleokinesis]], a process by which a [[microtubules|microtubule]] "cage" around the nucleus elongates and contracts in association with the [[centrosome]] to guide the nucleus to its final destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Samuels B, Tsai L |title=Nucleokinesis illuminated |journal=Nat Neurosci |volume=7 |issue=11 |pages=1169–70 |year=2004 |pmid=15508010 |doi=10.1038/nn1104-1169 |url=http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v7/n11/full/nn1104-1169.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radial glial cell]]s, whose fibers serve as a scaffolding for migrating cells and a means of radial communication mediated by calcium dynamic activity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rakic|first1=P|title=Mode of cell migration to the superficial layers of fetal monkey neocortex.|journal=The Journal of Comparative Neurology|date=May 1972|volume=145|issue=1|pages=61–83|pmid=4624784|doi=10.1002/cne.901450105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rash|first1=BG|last2=Ackman|first2=JB|last3=Rakic|first3=P|title=Bidirectional radial Ca(2+) activity regulates neurogenesis and migration during early cortical column formation.|journal=Science Advances|date=February 2016|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e1501733|pmid=26933693|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1501733|pmc=4771444|bibcode=2016SciA....2E1733R}}&lt;/ref&gt; act as the main excitatory neuronal stem cell of the cerebral cortex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noctor|first1=SC|last2=Flint|first2=AC|last3=Weissman|first3=TA|last4=Dammerman|first4=RS|last5=Kriegstein|first5=AR|title=Neurons derived from radial glial cells establish radial units in neocortex.|journal=Nature|date=8 February 2001|volume=409|issue=6821|pages=714–20|pmid=11217860|doi=10.1038/35055553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid11535293&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tamamaki N, Nakamura K, Okamoto K, Kaneko T |title=Radial glia is a progenitor of neocortical neurons in the developing cerebral cortex |journal=[[Neurosci.

===Tangential migration===
Most interneurons migrate tangentially through multiple modes of migration to reach their appropriate location in the cortex. An example of tangential migration is the movement of interneurons from the [[ganglionic eminence]] to the cerebral cortex. One example of ongoing tangential migration in a mature organism, observed in some animals, is the [[rostral migratory stream]] connecting [[subventricular zone]] and [[olfactory bulb]].

===Axophilic migration===
Many neurons migrating along the anterior-posterior axis of the body use existing axon tracts to migrate along; this is called axophilic migration. An example of this mode of migration is in [[GnRH Neuron|GnRH-expressing neurons]], which make a long journey from their birthplace in the nose, through the forebrain, and into the hypothalamus.&lt;ref name=Wray10&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wray S |title=From nose to brain: development of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone-1 neurones. |journal=J Neuroendocrinol |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=743–753 |year=2010 |pmid=20646175 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2826.2010.02034.x |pmc=2919238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the mechanisms of this migration have been worked out, starting with the extracellular guidance cues&lt;ref name=Giacobini07&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Giacobini P, Messina A, Wray S, Giampietro C, Crepaldi T, Carmeliet P, Fasolo A |title=Hepatocyte growth factor acts as a motogen and guidance signal for gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone-1 neuronal migration. |journal=J Neurosci |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=431–445 |year=2007 |pmid=17215404 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4979-06.2007 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/27/2/431.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; that trigger intracellular signaling.

===Other modes of migration===
There is also a method of neuronal migration called '''multipolar migration'''.&lt;ref name=Tabata03&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tabata H, Nakajima K |title=Multipolar migration: the third mode of radial neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex |journal=J Neurosci |volume=23 |issue=31 |pages=9996–10001 |date=5 November 2003|pmid=14602813 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/23/31/9996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nadarajah B, Alifragis P, Wong R, Parnavelas J |title=Neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex: observations based on real-time imaging |journal=Cereb Cortex |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=607–11 |year=2003 |pmid=12764035 |doi=10.1093/cercor/13.6.607 |url=http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/13/6/607}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen in  multipolar cells, which are abundantly present in the [[cortical intermediate zone]]. They do not resemble the cells migrating by locomotion or somal translocation. Instead these multipolar cells express neuronal markers and extend multiple thin processes in various directions independently of the radial glial fibers.&lt;ref name=Tabata03/&gt;

==Neurotrophic factors==
The survival of neurons is regulated by survival factors, called trophic factors. The neurotrophic hypothesis was formulated by Victor Hamburger and [[Rita Levi Montalcini]] based on studies of the developing nervous system.  Victor Hamburger discovered that implanting an extra limb in the developing chick led to an increase in the number of spinal motor neurons. Initially he thought that the extra limb was inducing proliferation of motor neurons, but he and his colleagues later showed that there was a great deal of motor neuron death during normal development, and the extra limb prevented this cell death. According to the neurotrophic hypothesis, growing axons compete for limiting amounts of target-derived trophic factors and axons that fail to receive sufficient trophic support die by apoptosis. It is now clear that factors produced by a number of sources contribute to neuronal survival.
* [[Nerve Growth Factor]] (NGF): Rita Levi Montalcini and Stanley Cohen purified the first trophic factor, Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), for which they received the Nobel Prize.  There are three NGF-related trophic factors: BDNF, NT3, and NT4, which regulate survival of various neuronal populations. The Trk proteins act as receptors for NGF and related factors. Trk is a receptor tyrosine kinase. Trk dimerization and phosphorylation leads to activation of various intracellular signaling pathways including the MAP kinase, Akt, and PKC pathways.
* CNTF: Ciliary neurotrophic factor is another protein that acts as a survival factor for motor neurons.  CNTF acts via a receptor complex that includes CNTFRα, GP130, and LIFRβ.  Activation of the receptor leads to phosphorylation and recruitment of the JAK kinase, which in turn phosphorylates [[LIFR]]β. LIFRβ acts as a docking site for the STAT transcription factors. JAK kinase phosphorylates STAT proteins, which dissociate from the receptor and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression.
* GDNF: Glial derived neurotrophic factor is a member of the [[TGFb]] family of proteins, and is a potent trophic factor for striatal neurons. The functional receptor is a heterodimer, composed of type 1 and type 2 receptors. Activation of the type 1 receptor leads to phosphorylation of Smad proteins, which translocate to the nucleus to activate gene expression.

==Synapse formation==

===Neuromuscular junction===
{{main article|Neuromuscular junction}}
Much of our understanding of synapse formation comes from studies at the neuromuscular junction.  The transmitter at this synapse is acetylcholine. The acetylcholine receptor (AchR) is present at the surface of muscle cells before synapse formation. The arrival of the nerve induces clustering of the receptors at the synapse. McMahan and Sanes showed that the synaptogenic signal is concentrated at the [[basal lamina]]. They also showed that the synaptogenic signal is produced by the nerve, and they identified the factor as [[Agrin]]. Agrin induces clustering of AchRs on the muscle surface and synapse formation is disrupted in agrin knockout mice. Agrin transduces the signal via MuSK receptor to [[rapsyn]]. Fischbach and colleagues showed that receptor subunits are selectively transcribed from nuclei next to the synaptic site. This is mediated by neuregulins.

In the mature synapse each muscle fiber is innervated by one motor neuron. However, during development many of the fibers are innervated by multiple axons. Lichtman and colleagues have studied the process of synapses elimination. This is an activity-dependent event.  Partial blockage of the receptor leads to retraction of corresponding presynaptic terminals.

===CNS synapses===
Agrin appears not to be a central mediator of CNS synapse formation and there is active interest in identifying signals that mediate CNS synaptogenesis.  Neurons in culture develop synapses that are similar to those that form in vivo, suggesting that synaptogenic signals can function properly in vitro. CNS synaptogenesis studies have focused mainly on glutamatergic synapses. Imaging experiments show that dendrites are highly dynamic during development and often initiate contact with axons. This is followed by recruitment of postsynaptic proteins to the site of contact. Stephen Smith and colleagues have shown that contact initiated by [[Dendritic Filopodia|dendritic filopodia]] can develop into synapses.

Induction of synapse formation by glial factors: Barres and colleagues made the observation that factors in glial conditioned media induce synapse formation in retinal ganglion cell cultures.  Synapse formation in the CNS is correlated with astrocyte differentiation suggesting that astrocytes might provide a synaptogenic factor. The identity of the astrocytic factors is not yet known.

Neuroligins and SynCAM as synaptogenic signals: Sudhof, Serafini, Scheiffele and colleagues have shown that neuroligins and SynCAM can act as factors that induce presynaptic differentiation. Neuroligins are concentrated at the postsynaptic site and act via neurexins concentrated in the presynaptic axons.  SynCAM is a cell adhesion molecule that is present in both pre- and post-synaptic membranes.

===Activity dependent mechanisms in the assembly of neural circuits===

The processes of [[neuronal migration]], differentiation and [[axon guidance]] are generally believed to be activity-independent mechanisms and rely on hard-wired genetic programs in the neurons themselves. New research findings however have implicated a role for activity-dependent mechanisms in mediating some aspects of the aforementioned processes such as the rate of [[neuronal migration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Komuro|first1=H|last2=Rakic|first2=P|title=Intracellular Ca2+ fluctuations modulate the rate of neuronal migration|journal=Neuron|date=1996|volume=17|pages=275–285|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(00)80159-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; aspects of neuronal differentiation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gu|first1=X|last2=Olson|first2=E.C|last3=Spitzer|first3=N.C|title=Spontaneous neuronal calcium spikes and waves during early differentiation|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|date=1994|volume=14|issue=11|pages=6325–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; and axon pathfinding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanson|first1=M.G|last2=Milner|first2=L.D|last3=Landmesser|first3=L.T|title=Spontaneous early activity in the chick spinal cord influences distinct motor axon pathfinding decisions|journal=Brain Res.

Contemporary diffusion-weigthted [[MRI]] techniques may also uncover the macroscopic process of axonal development. The [[connectome]] can be constructed from [[diffusion MRI]] data: the vertices of the graph correspond to anatomically labelled gray matter areas, and two such vertices, say ''u'' and ''v'', are connected by an edge if the [[tractography]] phase of the data processing finds an axonal fiber that connects the two areas, corresponding to ''u'' and ''v''. [[File:Ossz forog.webm|thumb|left|Consensus Connectome Dynamics]] Numerous braingraphs, computed from the [[Human Connectome Project]] can be downloaded from the http://braingraph.org site. The Consensus Connectome Dynamics (CCD) is a remarkable phenomenon that was discovered by continuously decreasing the minimum confidence-parameter at the graphical interface of the [[Budapest Reference Connectome]] Server.&lt;ref name="connectome"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Budapest Reference Connectome Server (http://connectome.pitgroup.org) depicts the cerebral connections of n=418 subjects with a frequency-parameter k: For any k=1,2,...,n one can view the graph of the edges that are present in at least k connectomes. If parameter k is decreased one-by-one from k=n through k=1 then more and more edges appear in the graph, since the inclusion condition is relaxed. The surprising observation is that the appearance of the edges is far from random: it resembles a growing, complex structure, like a tree or a shrub (visualized on the animation on the left).
It is hypothesized in &lt;ref name="Kerepesi2016"&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 11| issue = 6| pages =e0158680| last1 = Kerepesi| first1 = Csaba|last2 = Szalkai| first2 = Balazs|last3 = Varga| first3 = Balint|last4 = Grolmusz| first4 = Vince| title = How to Direct the Edges of the Connectomes: Dynamics of the Consensus Connectomes and the Development of the Connections in the Human Brain| journal = PLOS One| year = 2016| pmc=4928947| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0158680| pmid=27362431| arxiv = 1509.05703| bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1158680K}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the growing structure copies the axonal [[development of the human brain]]: the earliest developing connections (axonal fibers) are common at most of the subjects, and the subsequently developing connections have larger and larger variance, because their variances are accumulated in the process of axonal development.

==Synapse elimination==
{{main article|Synaptic pruning}}
Several motorneurons compete for each neuromuscular junction, but only one survives until adulthood. Competition ''in vitro'' has been shown to involve a limited neurotrophic substance that is released, or that neural activity infers advantage to strong post-synaptic connections by giving resistance to a toxin also released upon nerve stimulation. ''In vivo'', it is suggested that muscle fibres select the strongest neuron through a retrograde signal.

==Adult neurogenesis==
{{main article|Adult neurogenesis}}

Contrary to popular belief, [[neurogenesis]] also occurs in specific parts of the adult brain.

'''Dolichol''' refers to any of a group of long-chain mostly [[unsaturated compound|unsaturated]] [[organic compound]]s that are made up of varying numbers of [[isoprene]] units terminating in an α-saturated isoprenoid group, containing an [[alcohol]] functional group.

==Functions==
Dolichols play a role in the co-translational modification of proteins known as [[glycosylation|''N''-glycosylation]] in the form of dolichol [[phosphate]].  Dolichols function as a membrane anchor for the formation of the [[oligosaccharide]] Glc3-Man9-GlcNAc2 (where Glc is [[glucose]], Man is [[mannose]], and GlcNAc is [[N-acetylglucosamine]]).  This oligosaccharide is transferred from the dolichol donor onto certain [[asparagine]] residues (onto a specific sequence that is "Asn-X-Ser/Thr") of newly forming polypeptide chains.  Dolichol is also involved in transfer of the monosaccharides to the forming Glc3-Man9-GlcNAc2-Dolichol carrier.

In addition, dolichols can be adducted to [[protein]]s as a [[posttranslational modification]], a process in which branched carbohydrate trees are formed on a dolichol moiety and then transferred to an assembly of proteins to form a large [[glycoprotein]] in the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]].

Dolichols are the major lipid component (14% by mass) of human substantia nigra (SN) [[neuromelanin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fedorow|first1=Heidi|last2=Pickford|first2=Russell|last3=Hook|first3=James M.|last4=Double|first4=Kay L.|last5=Halliday|first5=Glenda M.|last6=Gerlach|first6=Manfred|last7=Riederer|first7=Peter|last8=Garner|first8=Brett|title=Dolichol is the major lipid component of human substantia nigra neuromelanin|journal=Journal of Neurochemistry|date=February 2005|volume=92|issue=4|pages=990–995|doi=10.1111/j.1471-4159.2004.02975.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dolichol phosphate was discovered at the University of Liverpool in the 1960s, although researchers did not know its function at the time of discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chojnacki|first1=T|last2=Dallner|first2=G|title=The biological role of dolichol.|journal=The Biochemical Journal|date=1 April 1988|volume=251|issue=1|pages=1–9|pmid=3291859|doi=10.1042/bj2510001|pmc=1148956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in aging==
Dolichol has been suggested to be used as a [[Biomarkers of aging|biomarker for aging]].&lt;ref&gt;"J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci. 2005 Jan;60(1):39-43".&lt;/ref&gt; During aging, the [[human brain]] shows a progressive increase in levels of dolichol, a reduction in levels of [[ubiquinone]], but relatively unchanged concentrations of [[cholesterol]] and dolichyl phosphate. In the [[neurodegenerative disease]] [[Alzheimer's disease]], the situation is reversed, with decreased levels of dolichol and increased levels of [[ubiquinone]]. The concentrations of dolichyl phosphate are also increased, while [[cholesterol]] remains unchanged. This study [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7950967] shows that the [[isoprenoid]] changes in [[Alzheimer's disease]] differ from those occurring during normal aging, and, therefore, this disease cannot be regarded as a result of [[premature aging]]. The increase in the sugar carrier dolichyl phosphate may reflect an increased rate of [[glycosylation]] in the diseased brain, and the increase in the endogenous [[anti-oxidant]] [[ubiquinone]] an attempt to protect the brain from [[oxidative stress]], for instance, induced by [[lipid peroxidation]].&lt;ref&gt;"Edlund C, Söderberg M, Kristensson K. Neurochem Int, 1994 Jul,25(1), 35-8."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==
Dolichol is a product of the [[HMG-CoA reductase pathway]] (also known as the [[mevalonate]] pathway), and as such their creation and availability are affected by [[mevalonate inhibition]]. First, a cis (or Z) -prenyltransferase catalyzes the condensation of [[farnesyl diphosphate]] (FPP) with a varying number (dependent on the particular cis-prenyltransferase) of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) molecules, resulting in the formation of a polyprenyl diphosphate (also known as dehydrodolichyl diphosphate). This subsequently undergoes loss of both phosphate groups, resulting in a polyprenol (dehydrodolichol). Lastly, the α isoprenoid unit is saturated by α-saturase (still a hypothetical enzyme), and this α-saturated polyprenyl alcohol is known as dolichol.&lt;ref&gt;"Schenk, B.; Fernandez, F.; Waechter, C. J. ''Glycobiology'', 2001, 11(5), 61R-70R."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other ==
Dolichols are found in eukaryotes and in archaea,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Benjamin H.|last2=Albers|first2=Sonja-Verena|date=2013-02-01|title=Hot and sweet: protein glycosylation in Crenarchaeota|url=http://www.biochemsoctrans.org/content/41/1/384|journal=Biochemical Society Transactions|language=en|volume=41|issue=1|pages=384–392|doi=10.1042/BST20120296|issn=0300-5127|pmid=23356316}}&lt;/ref&gt; although similar [[polyprenol]]s molecules are found in bacteria.  Polyprenols in bacteria do not contain an α-saturated isoprenoid and are typically smaller in terms of isoprenoid units or carbon length.  Polyprenols perform similar functions within bacteria; that is, they function as glycosyl carrier lipids involved in formation of complex branched polysaccharide.  However, the cellular process they are involved in is not glycosylation, but instead cell wall biosynthesis. Statins decrease dolichol levels in the body.&lt;ref name="pmid19534648"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bełtowski J, Wójcicka G, Jamroz-Wiśniewska A |title=Adverse effects of statins - mechanisms and consequences |journal=Curr Drug Saf |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=209–28 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19534648 |doi=10.2174/157488609789006949 |url=http://www.benthamdirect.org/pages/content.php?CDS/2009/00000004/00000003/0009CDS.SGM |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190654/http://www.benthamdirect.org/pages/content.php?CDS%2F2009%2F00000004%2F00000003%2F0009CDS.SGM |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical Significance==
The Australian pharmaceutical company [[Solagran]] has been investigating the medical significance of [[polyprenol]]s and their substitution with dolichols when ingested where there is a deficiency. Trials of Ropren (already pharmaceutically registered as a hepatoprotector) in relation to neurodegenerative diseases (including Alzheimer's disease) in both Russia [http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20050920/pdf/3sd7g0mczqbnc.pdf] and Australia [http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20070221/pdf/3111ztwcbqzkk9.pdf] indicate considerable potential as a safe and effective treatment.

'''Education about the Holocaust''' or Holocaust education refers to efforts, in formal and non-formal settings, to teach about the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. Teaching and Learning about the Holocaust (TLH) addresses didactics and learning, under the larger umbrella of education about the Holocaust, which also comprises curricula and textbooks studies. The expression “Teaching and Learning about the Holocaust” is used by the [[International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002480/248071E.pdf|title=Education about the Holocaust and preventing genocide|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100221-2|location=|pages=18, 23–24, 27–28, 30, 38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most Holocaust education centers have focused on the genocide committed against Jews by the Nazis, a growing number have expanded their mission and programming to include the murder of other groups by the Nazi and Stalinist regimes, the [[Armenian Genocide|Armenian genocide]], the [[Rwandan genocide]], [[Kurdish genocide (disambiguation)|Kurdish genocide]], [[Croatian Genocide|Croatian genocide]], [[Bosnian genocide]], indigenous genocide due to colonization&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Little Matter of Genocide: Holocaust and Denial in the Americas 1492 to the Present|last=Churchill|first=Ward|publisher=City Lights Books|year=1997|isbn=9780872863231|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and other mass exterminations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Bystanders: Educational Leadership for a Humane Culture in a Globalizing Reality|last=Auron|first=Yair|last2=|first2=|publisher=SensePublishers|year=2017|isbn=978-94-6351-026-4|editor-last=Aloni|editor-first=Nimrod|location=Rotterdam, The Netherlands|pages=169-180|chapter=The Obligation to Teach About the Holocaust and Genocide, and the Obligation to Educate Against Racism|editor-last2=Weintrob|editor-first2=Lori}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These centers also address [[racism]], [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]], [[Islamophobia]], [[homophobia]], [[lesbophobia]], [[biphobia]], and [[transphobia]].

== Contexts for teaching about the Holocaust ==
Multiple opportunities exist for teaching about the Holocaust. The text that follows explores the role that teaching and learning about the Holocaust can play in three specific contexts: the prevention of genocide, the promotion of human rights and dealing with traumatic pasts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== The prevention of genocide ===
To teach about the particularity of the Holocaust is an opportunity to teach about the nature and dynamics of mass atrocity crimes, i.e. [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crime]]s. The United Nations Framework of Analysis of Atrocity Crimes states “atrocity crimes are considered to be the most serious crimes against humankind. Their status as international crimes is based on the belief that the acts associated with them affect the core dignity of human beings.” From a human perspective, but also from social, political and economic perspectives, the costs and consequences of these crimes are immeasurable and extend far beyond the limits of territories where they were perpetrated. Prevention has, therefore, been identified by the international community as a necessity for international peace and stability. Prevention requires continuous efforts and awareness in both the short and long term at the local, national and global levels. Such measures may include institutional initiatives that strengthen the rule of law and protect human rights, ensure a better management of diverse societies and reinforce civil society and independent media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Education about the Holocaust, as well as [[Genocide education|education more broadly about genocide]] and mass atrocities, provides the opportunity to help build critical thinking skills, to augment resilient and effective responses to extreme and exclusionary ideologies, and to illuminate for students how they see themselves in the context of their country’s past, present and future.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The promotion of human rights ===
The Holocaust began with abuses of power and gross [[human rights]] violations by [[Nazi Germany]] that over time escalated into war and genocide. While not all human rights violations result in genocide, the Holocaust presents an important case to be explored in a human rights context. The discriminatory policies and practices that dehumanized and marginalized Jews and other minority or political groups (such as depriving individuals of their citizenship) illuminate how human rights violations when combined with factors such as the abuse of power and/or exclusionary ideology can become normalized in a society – even one framed by the rule of law. That these policies escalated over time to a state-sponsored system for murder underlines the dangerous environment that can result when human rights are disavowed. In the aftermath of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and the Holocaust, a number of international norms promoting human rights were formulated, including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide. Examining this outcome represents a crucial phase in understanding the evolution of human rights concepts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Still, education about the Holocaust and [[human rights education]] are two distinct fields. How educators can create the space for students to examine the history in a manner that respects the tenets of each field requires some thought. A number of organizations have considered these points of intersection, including the [[Fundamental Rights Agency|European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights]] (FRA), in partnership with [[Yad Vashem]],&lt;ref&gt;European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights. 2011. Toolkit on the Holocaust and Human Rights education in the EU. &lt;/ref&gt; and the German Foundation “Remembrance, Responsibility and Future” (EVZ). Thoughtfully integrating examination of the Holocaust into a human rights framework can be an important dimension of education that promotes critical thinking about the roles and responsibilities of members of society and their leaders in the context of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Eckmann, M. 2015. Is Teaching and Learning about the Holocaust Relevant for Human Rights Education? Gross, Z. and Stevic, E.D. (eds.), ''As the Witnesses Fall Silent: 21st Century Holocaust Education in Curriculum, Policy and Practice'', UNESCO IBE/Springer International, pp. 65-53. &lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Dealing with the past ===
Educating about the Holocaust is primarily a duty for European countries, in which considerable segments of societies either collaborated with Nazi Germany or stood by. After an initial period of silence and/or minimization, many countries have developed an understanding of the need to educate about the Holocaust and the obligation to investigate and face their national past. Nevertheless, national, professional or individual responsibilities remain heavily debated within and among countries where the Holocaust took place. Even more than 70 years after the events, a self-critical vision of history that accounts for the range of responsibilities in the murder of Jews and other groups such as the [[Romani people|Roma]] has yet to emerge in many places. Nationalistic ideologies continue to influence the ways in which history is remembered and taught.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Many post-atrocity communities throughout the world struggle with divided societies. Social cohesion remains fractured and progress is blocked by the country’s refusal to deal with its national history of genocide and mass atrocities and the long-term trauma such crimes cause. This challenge increases when con icting parties or survivors and their tormentors must co-exist in the same society in the aftermaths of atrocity crimes. While some societies opt for an approach of silence, others have found that as a society transitions towards non-violent and humane ways to handle conflict, facing the past can become an important element of the national narrative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Teaching about a contested history involving atrocities that still affect the present is a particularly challenging task, all the more so because history education is one of the most difficult segments of education systems to reform. Moreover, dealing with the history of past abuses through education often requires a minimal consensus within the society, and therefore institutional support, before new historical narratives accounting for crimes perpetrated can be integrated in curricula and textbooks or tackled by teachers in formal education settings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such a process is happening in [[Lithuania]], where the Holocaust and the [[history of the Jews in Lithuania]] has not been taught adequately until fairly recently.&lt;ref&gt;Gerdziunas, Benas.  [http://www.politico.eu/interactive/decades-after-soviet-terror-lithuania-confronts-holocaust/ "Decades after Soviet terror, Lithuania confronts its Holocaust."] ''Politico''.  30 August 2017.  6 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educating about genocide ==
{{Main|Genocide education}}

“Genocide education” deals with the phenomenon of genocide, while education about the Holocaust focuses above all on the causes and dynamics of the genocide of the Jewish people and responses to it. However, both fields are increasingly interconnected. To date, the Holocaust has been the most researched, documented and widely taught case of genocide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

[http://www.ihgjlm.com The Institute on the Holocaust &amp; Genocide in Jerusalem] established in 1979, believes that it may be the first holocaust education center to address the genocide of all peoples&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ihgjlm.com|title=Institute on the Holocaust &amp; Genocide in Jerusalem : Taking the side of protecting all human life.|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Institute on the Holocaust &amp; Genocide in Jerusalem|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing number of holocaust education centers include [[genocide]], intolerance, [[hatred]], and [[human rights]] within their mission, programming, and curriculum.  

== The Holocaust in curricula and textbooks ==
{{Main|The Holocaust in curricula|The Holocaust in textbooks}}The Holocaust in [[Curriculum|curricula]] and [[textbook]]s discusses the ways in which the Holocaust is presented in secondary school level history and social studies [[Curriculum|curricula]] worldwide, and conceptualized and narrated in [[textbook]]s. The status of the Holocaust in curricula and textbooks varies considerably worldwide.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002287/228776e.pdf|title=The International status of education about the Holocaust: a global mapping of textbooks and curricula|last=Carrier|first=Peter|last2=Fuchs|first2=Eckhardt|last3=Messinger|first3=Torben|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100033-1|location=|pages=4, 12, 19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curricula and textbooks, in particular those designed for history teaching, provide both a space for the formation of a condensed canon of knowledge which is considered to be relevant to a specific society, and a means by which claims to social legitimacy may be made. The study of curricula and textbooks enables the reconstruction of patterns of perception and interpretation, or the standards and values which hold sway at any given time. Moreover, they offer insights into the variety of ways in which national identities are conceived of and constructed. They are ideal sources for the following reasons:
# Curricula and textbooks strive towards the construction of a socially cohesive understanding of history. They not only determine which historical events are considered relevant and thus worth incorporating into a shared inventory of historical understanding, but also prescribe the interpretative framework in which such events may be classified.
# Textbooks share a relatively homogeneous function across a wide geographical space. They thus meet a prerequisite for the analysis of ways in which concepts of identity change from place to place and of processes of convergence and divergence to which concepts of the Holocaust are subjected.
# Curricula and textbooks continue to provide reasonably reliable points of reference for educators. The complexity of the Holocaust and the sensitivity towards the social and political consequences of this event which continues to be felt in the present day mean that teachers are often uncertain about how they should teach the Holocaust. As a result, curricula and in particular textbooks are held by educators to provide secure sources of information and of methods to which teachers refer on the assumption that they provide accurate content and reliable didactic and methodological guidelines, which have been compiled by experienced historians, educational experts and authors.
# Although television, the [[internet]] and family stories generally represent the primary sources of knowledge about the Holocaust, curricula and textbooks tell the contemporary formation of historical knowledge because they fix in words the conceptual and narrative categories in which events of the past are to be learnt in a given society. One of the central concerns when comparing both curricula and textbooks, is therefore to ensure that linguistic variations be given due attention. The absence of the words ‘Holocaust’ or ‘Shoah’ (or their equivalents in each language), for example, does not mean that this event is not taught, because alternative words or paraphrases may also convey knowledge of the event in unexpected ways.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Contribution to Global Citizenship Education (GCED) ==
[[Global citizenship education|Global Citizenship Education]] (GCED) aims to develop students to be informed and critically literate, socially connected, respectful of diversity, and ethically responsible and engaged. There exist strong opportunities for aligning education about the Holocaust with the goals of GCED. Indeed, understanding how and why the Holocaust happened can help learners reflect on their role as global citizens, develop skills in historical understanding regarding why individuals and states acted the way they did in their given circumstances, and possibly take action on civic issues important for their school and society. Teaching about the Holocaust can, therefore, be expected to provide opportunities for contemporary skill-building, decision-making, and critical self-reflection on one’s own role in society. The study of the Holocaust is highly compatible with GCED for at least three key reasons:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The Holocaust addresses themes that are central concerns of GCED, including human rights and discrimination.
* The Holocaust forms the historical backdrop that informed the development of the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which can be understood concretely by linking them to specific violations before and during the Second World War.
* A review of research about teaching and learning about the Holocaust demonstrates that some approaches can have outcomes that are sought by the GCED framework.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
[[UNESCO]] has stated that holocaust and genocide education is part of its efforts to promote Global Citizenship Education and a priority within its Education 2030 agenda&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/holocaust-genocide-education|title=Education about the Holocaust and Genocide|last=|first=|date=|website=UNESCO: Education about the Holocaust and Genocide|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Federal University of Agriculture, [[Abeokuta]]''', [[Ogun State]], or '''FUNAAB''', ([http://www.unaab.edu.ng FUNAAB]) was established on 1st of January, 1988 by the Federal Government when four universities of technology, earlier merged in 1984, were demerged. This led to the creation of the first two universities of agriculture in Abeokuta and [[Makurdi]].

On the same date, Professor Nurudeen Olorun-Nimbe Adedipe was appointed the pioneer Vice-Chancellor of the university.  Professor Adedipe officially assumed duty on 28th of January, 1988. For many years the date which Professor Adedipe assumed duty was wrongly adopted as the foundation day.  Following a revisit to the instrument setting up the university, a council decision at its 53rd statutory meeting in June 2010 reverted the foundation date to 1st, January 1988 as prescribed by the law which established the university.

Prior to the emergence of [http://www.unaab.edu.ng FUNAAB], the Federal Government had established [[Federal Government of Nigeria|Federal]] [[University]] of [[Technology]], [[Abeokuta]] (FUTAB) in 1983. Then, in 1984, it was merged with the University of Lagos and had its name changed to the College of Science and Technology, Abeokuta (COSTAB), before the demerger of January, 1988.

The university started off from the old campus of [[Abeokuta Grammar School]], Isale-Igbein near the city centre. It completed its movement to its permanent site along Alabata Road in 1997.

At the initial stage, five colleges were introduced in the university in October 1988 as follows:
*    College of Agricultural Management, [[Rural development]] and Communication Studies (COLAMRUCS), which name was later changed to COLAMRUD (College Of Agriculture Management and Rural Development)
*    [https://web.archive.org/web/20110907150444/http://www.unaab.edu.ng/colanim.html College of Animal Science and Livestock Production] (COLANIM)
*    [https://web.archive.org/web/20110902141612/http://www.unaab.edu.ng/colerm.html College of Environmental Resources Management] (COLERM)
*    [https://web.archive.org/web/20110908052118/http://www.unaab.edu.ng/colnas.html College of Natural Sciences] (COLNAS)

College of Natural Science was reformed and redrafted into 2 colleges which are College of Physical Sciences (COLPHYS) and College of Biological Science (COLBIOS)
*    [https://web.archive.org/web/20110909005025/http://www.unaab.edu.ng/colplant.html College of Plant Science and Crop Production] (COLPLANT)

Two additional Colleges, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110904022211/http://www.unaab.edu.ng/coleng.html College of Engineering] (COLENG) and [https://web.archive.org/web/20111006174137/http://www.unaab.edu.ng/colvet.html College of Veterinary Medicine] (COLVET) were introduced in March, 2002. During the 2008/2009 session, the College of Agricultural Management, Rural Development and Communication Studies was split into two, with two new colleges emerging as follows:
*    [https://web.archive.org/web/20110908070629/http://www.unaab.edu.ng/colfhec.html College of Food Science and Human Ecology] (COLFHEC)
*    [https://web.archive.org/web/20110909033604/http://www.unaab.edu.ng/c.html College of Agricultural Management and Rural Development] (COLAMRUD)
The newest college is [https://web.archive.org/web/20121123192138/http://www.unaab.edu.ng/colleges/management-sciences-.html College of Management Sciences] (COLMAS)

The university is one of the three universities of agriculture in [[Nigeria]], the other being in [[Makurdi]] (Benue State) and [[Umudike]] (Abia State). The university started at its mini-campus in Isale-Igbein in the heart of [[Abeokuta]], the capital of [[Ogun State]].

==Governing council==
The first council was constituted on 18 May 1989 under the chairmanship of Alhaji Muhammadu Jega, former Head of Service and Secretary to the Sokoto State Government. On 1 September 1990, the council was reconstituted with some changes for five years with Alhaji Muhammadu Jega retained as Chairman. The second governing council was constituted in 2000 for five years, with Alhaji Sanni Bagiwa Idris as Chairman. The third council came on board in 2005 and was dissolved in November, 2007 by the Federal Government. Elder Brigadier General (Rtd.) Bassey Asuquo, a one-time Military Administrator of Kogi, Edo and Delta States respectively, was the Chairman.

‘Nimbe Adedipe Library' was named in honour of the first Vice-Chancellor of the University, Professor Nurudeen Olorunnimbe Adedipe. The library building can accommodate 1000 users at a time.  The total collection of books at present is 54,000 titles.

The library started its automation programme in 1994 when it acquired through a [[World Bank Project]], an IBM personal computer and the [[TINLIB]] library software designed for four work stations. This was later upgraded to ten work stations. The library has since migrated from the DOS based TINLIB software to a more versatile windows based [[GLAS]] (Graphical Library Automated System) software with the capability to operate 50 work stations within the library. OPAC is fully functional making it possible to catalogue books on line and for library clients to access such books immediately.

[[File:Views of a Foetus in the Womb.jpg|thumb|right|"Views of a Fetus in the Womb", [[Leonardo da Vinci]], ca. 1510–1512.]]
'''Fetal position''' ([[British English]]: also foetal) is the [[position (Obstetrics)|position]]ing of the [[Human body|body]] of a prenatal [[fetus]] as it [[pregnancy|develops]]. In this position, the back is curved, the head is bowed, and the [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] are bent and drawn up to the torso. 

This position is used in the medical profession to minimize injury to the neck and chest. 

Sometimes, when a person has suffered extreme [[physical trauma|physical]] or [[psychological trauma]] (including massive [[stress (medicine)|stress]]), they will assume the fetal position or a similar position in which the back is curved forward, the legs are brought up as tightly against the abdomen as possible, the head is bowed as close to the abdomen as possible, and the arms are wrapped around the head to prevent further [[Physical trauma|trauma]]. This position provides better protection to the brain and vital organs than simply lying spread out on the ground, so it is clear as to why it is an instinctual reaction to extreme stress or trauma when the brain is no longer able to cope with the surrounding environment, and in essence "shuts down" temporarily.

The fetal position has been observed in [[drug addiction|drug addicts]], who enter the position when experiencing withdrawal. Sufferers of anxiety are also known to assume the fetal position during panic attacks.

Many people assume this position when [[sleep]]ing, especially when the body becomes cold.

A study by Professor Chris Idzikowski, director of the Sleep Assessment and Advisory Service found that people who consistently sleep in the fetal position tend to have a shy and sensitive personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | date = 16 September 2003
  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3112170.stm
  | accessdate = 10 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming this position and playing dead is often recommended as a strategy to end a [[bear attack]].&lt;ref&gt;"Bear Attacks Their Causes and Avoidance" by [[Stephen Herrero]], pg 24 {{ISBN|0-941130-82-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many baby [[mammal]]s, especially [[rodent]]s, remain in the fetal position well after being born.

The fetal position is also one of the most comfortable and familiar positions to the human, as they remain in the position for the last two trimesters of pregnancy.{{citation needed|reason=There is no scientific evidence that fetal position is comfortable or familiar to humans. Relating comfortability to the last two trimesters of pregnancy is invalid unless there is a study proving the two things are related.|date=June 2016}} Babies are most often found stretched out, however, because they do not have full control of their limbs, resulting in flailing and twitching.

'''Frame semantics''' is a theory of [[Linguistics|linguistic]] [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] developed by [[Charles J. Fillmore]] that extends his earlier [[case grammar]]. It relates [[natural language|linguistic]] [[semantics]] to encyclopedic knowledge.
The basic idea is that one cannot understand the meaning of a single word without access to all the essential knowledge that relates to that word. For example, one would not be able to understand the word "sell" without knowing anything about the situation of commercial transfer, which also involves, among other things, a seller, a buyer, goods, money, the relation between the money and the goods, the relations between the seller and the goods and the money, the relation between the buyer and the goods and the money and so on.

Thus, a word activates, or evokes, a frame of semantic knowledge relating to the specific concept to which it refers (or highlights, in frame semantic terminology).

A '''semantic frame''' is a collection of facts that specify "characteristic features, attributes, and functions of a denotatum, and its characteristic interactions with things necessarily or typically associated with it." &lt;ref&gt;Keith Alan (2001, p. 251), Natural Language Semantics, Blackwell Publishers Ltd, Oxford, {{ISBN|0-631-19296-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
A semantic frame can also be defined as a [[Coherentism|coherent structure]] of related concepts that are related such that without knowledge of all of them, one does not have complete knowledge of any one; they are in that sense types of [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]]&lt;ref&gt; needed &lt;/ref&gt;. Frames are based on recurring experiences. So the commercial transaction frame is based on recurring experiences of commercial transactions.

Words not only highlight individual concepts, but also specify a certain perspective from which the frame is viewed. For example "sell" views the situation from the perspective of the seller and "buy" from the perspective of the buyer. This, according to Fillmore, explains the observed asymmetries in many [[lexical semantics|lexical relations]].

While originally only being applied to [[lexeme]]s, frame semantics has now been expanded to [[grammatical construction]]s and other larger and more complex linguistic units and has more or less been integrated into [[construction grammar]] as the main semantic principle. Semantic frames are also becoming used in [[information model]]ing, for example in [[Gellish]], especially in the form of 'definition models' and 'knowledge models'.

Frame semantics has much in common with the semantic principle of profiling from [[Ronald Langacker|Ronald W. Langacker]]'s [[Cognitive Grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cruse (2004, p. 137f.), Meaning in Language. An Introduction to Semantics and Pragmatics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16939">A '''fundamental ephemeris''' of the [[Solar System]] is a [[Computer simulation|model]] of the objects of the system in space, with all of their positions and motions accurately represented. It is intended to be a high-precision primary reference for prediction and observation of those positions and motions, and which provides a basis for further refinement of the model. It is generally not intended to cover the entire life of the Solar System; usually a short-duration time span, perhaps a few centuries, is represented to high accuracy. Some long ephemerides cover several millennia to medium accuracy.

They are published by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris|Development Ephemeris]]. The latest releases include DE430 which covers planetary and lunar ephemeris from Dec 21, 1549 to Jan 25, 2650 with high precision and is intended for general use for modern time periods . DE431 was created to cover a longer time period Aug 15, -13200 to March 15, 17191 with slightly less precision for use with historic observations and far reaching forecasted positions.  DE432 was released as a minor update to DE430 with improvements to the Pluto barycenter in support of the [[New Horizons]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/de432.pdf|title=JPL Memo IOM 392R-14-003|last=Folkner|first=|date=April 30, 2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The set of physical laws and numerical constants used in the calculation of the ephemeris must be self-consistent and precisely specified. The ephemeris must be calculated strictly in accordance with this set, which represents the most current knowledge of all relevant physical forces and effects. Current fundamental ephemerides are typically released with exact descriptions of all mathematical models, methods of computation, observational data, and adjustment to the observations at the time of their announcement.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, {{cite web|url=http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/de405iom/de405iom.pdf |title=JPL Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides DE405/LE405 |author=Standish |date=1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220062549/http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/de405iom/de405iom.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-20 |df= }}; {{cite web|url=http://www.imcce.fr/inpop/inpop10a.pdf |title=INPOP10a |author=Fienga |display-authors=etal |date=2010 }}; {{cite web|url=http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/EPM2004.pdf |title=High-Precision Ephemerides of Planets—EPM and Determination of Some Astronomical Constants |author=Pitjeva |date=2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031065523/http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/EPM2004.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may not have been the case in the past, as fundamental ephemerides were then computed from a collection of methods derived over a span of decades by many researchers.&lt;ref name="sandw"&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/ioms/ExplSupplChap8.pdf |author=Standish and Williams |title=CHAPTER 8: Orbital Ephemerides of the Sun, Moon, and Planets |date=2010}} A chapter from an as-yet-unpublished (Feb 2012) version of the ''Explanatory Supplement'' (see [[#Sources|Sources]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The independent variable of the ephemeris is always time. In the case of the most current ephemerides, it is a [[Coordinate time|relativistic coordinate time]] scale equivalent to the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] definition of [[Barycentric Coordinate Time|TCB]].&lt;ref name="sandw" /&gt; In the past, [[Solar time|mean solar time]] (before the discovery of the non-uniform [[rotation of the Earth]]) and [[ephemeris time]] (before the implementation of [[Post-Newtonian expansion|relativistic gravitational equations]]) were used. The remainder of the ephemeris can consist of either the mathematical equations and initial conditions which describe the motions of the bodies of the Solar System, of tabulated data calculated from those equations and conditions, or of condensed mathematical representations of the tabulated data.

A fundamental ephemeris is the basis from which apparent ephemerides, phenomena, and orbital elements are computed for astronomical, nautical, and surveyors' almanacs. Apparent ephemerides give positions and motions of Solar System bodies as seen by observers from the surface of Earth, and are useful for astronomers, navigators, and surveyors in planning observations and in reducing the data acquired, although much of the work of latter two has been supplanted by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] technology. Phenomena are events related to the configurations of Solar System bodies, for instance [[Sunrise|rise]] and [[Sunset|set]] times, [[Lunar phase|phases]], [[eclipse]]s and [[occultation]]s, and have many civil and scientific applications. [[Orbital elements]] are descriptions of the motion of a body at a particular instant, used for further short-time-span calculation of the body's position when high accuracy is not required.

==History==
Astronomers have been tasked with computing accurate ephemerides, originally for purposes of sea navigation, from at least the 18th century. In England, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] founded the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] in 1675,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rmg.co.uk/royal-observatory/history/ |title=History of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began publishing ''[[The Nautical Almanac]]'' in 1766.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/na_history.php |title=History of The Nautical Almanac}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the ''[[Bureau des Longitudes]]'' was founded in 1795 to publish the ''[[Connaissance des Temps]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imcce.fr/en/presentation/histoire_imcce.php |title=History of the IMCCE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early fundamental ephemerides of these publications came from many different sources and authors as the science of [[celestial mechanics]] matured.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Explanatory Supplement'' (1961), chap. 7 or ''Explanatory Supplement'' (1992), chap. 13 for extensive lists of sources of the early fundamental ephemerides of the ''Nautical Almanac''. (see [[#Sources|Sources]])&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 19th century, the analytical methods of [[Perturbation (astronomy)|general perturbations]] reached the probable limits of what could be accomplished by hand calculation.

From the mid 20th century, work began on [[numerical integration]] of the [[equations of motion]] on [[IBM SSEC|early computing machines]] for purposes of producing fundamental ephemerides for the ''Astronomical Almanac''. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto were based on the work of Eckert, ''et al''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Eckert |author2=Brouwer |author3=Clemence |date=1951 |title=Coordinates of the Five Outer Planets 1953–2060 |series=Astronom.

Papers American Ephem. |volume=XIII |issue=Part V}}&lt;/ref&gt; through 1983. The fundamental ephemeris of the Moon, always a difficult problem in celestial mechanics, remained a work-in-progress through the early 1980s. It was based originally on the work of Brown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nBFLAAAAYAAJ |author=Brown |date=1919 |title=Tables of the Motion of the Moon |publisher=Yale University Press, New Haven, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt; with updates and corrections by Clemence, ''et al''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1952 |title=Aberration in the Lunar Ephemeris |journal=Astronomical Journal |volume=57 |pages=46–47|bibcode=1952AJ.....57...46C |doi=10.1086/106703 |last1=Clemence |first1=G.

Starting in 1984, a revolution in the methods of producing fundamental ephemerides began.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |date=1983 |bibcode=1983A&amp;A...125..150N |title=DE 102 – A numerically integrated ephemeris of the moon and planets spanning forty-four centuries |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=125 |issue=1|pages=150 |author1=Newhall |first1=X.

From 2003 onward (as of Feb 2012), [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris|JPL's DE405/LE405]], an integrated ephemeris referred to the [[International Celestial Reference Frame]], has been used.&lt;ref name="sandw" /&gt; In France, the ''Bureau des Longitudes'' began using their machine-generated semi-analytical theory VSOP82 in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1982A&amp;A...114..278B |title=Théorie du mouvement de l'ensemble des planètes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5251">'''Gary Alfred Tomlinson''' (born December 4, 1951) is an American [[musicologist]] and the John Hay Whitney Professor of Music and Humanities at [[Yale University]]. He was formerly the Annenberg Professor in the Humanities at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sas.upenn.edu/music/faculty/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], with a Ph.D., in 1979 with thesis titled ''Rinuccini, Peri, Monteverdi, and the humanist heritage of opera''.

Tomlinson became Director of the Whitney Humanities Center, Yale University, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musicologist and cultural theorist Tomlinson named director of Whitney Humanities Center|url=http://news.yale.edu/2012/04/23/musicologist-and-cultural-theorist-tomlinson-named-director-whitney-humanities-center|website=YaleNews|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomlinson's research has ranged across diverse fields, including the history of opera, early-modern European musical thought and practice, the musical cultures of indigenous American societies, and the philosophy of history and critical theory.  His latest research concerns music, culture, and human evolution.  Here he is concerned to reshape the relations of evolutionary theory, archaeology, and humanistic theory so as to offer a novel model of the emergence of human modernity.  The chief ingredients of his model are the niche-construction theory of biologists' extended evolutionary synthesis, a growing systematization of culture evident in the archaeological record, and an extended semiotics indebted to Charles Sanders Peirce.

'''Henry''' '''(Jindřich, Heinrich) Kulka'''&lt;ref&gt;Like Adolf Loos Henry Kulka was an Anglophile and adopted the preferred name of Henry Kulka since before his emigration to New Zealand. Kulka was a native Czech speaker. German was his second language.&lt;/ref&gt; (29 March 1900 – 9 May 1971) was a Moravian (Czechoslovak) modern architect who was a key figure in the development of ‘Raumplan’ architecture in central Europe between 1919 and 1938. Kulka brought this approach to spatial planning and the Loosian traditions of natural material craftsmanship to modern building in New Zealand (1940–1971) where he was a pioneer of modern architecture.

== Life ==
Henry Kulka was born on 29 March 1900 into a Jewish family in the town of [[Litovel]] near [[Olomouc]] in the Czech Republic (then [[Austria-Hungary]]). His father Moritz owned and ran the village drapery shop. He was the youngest of three children, having two older sisters. Young Henry was sent to Vienna to complete his secondary education after which he studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna. As he found his studies uninspiring he did not complete his degree but preferred to continue his architectural development as a pupil of the pioneer modern architect and ideologue Adolf Loos. He became Loos’s assistant in 1919 and by the end of 1927 ran a joint architectural practice with Loos as full collaborating partner. In 1927 he married Hilda Beran and they had two children, Richard and Elizabeth (Maru). The young couple was active in the rich intellectual life of Vienna of that time.  After Loos died Kulka continued his work in Vienna.  When the Nazis occupied Austria in 1938 Kulka and his family fled to Czechoslovakia where his wife’s family lived. When the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia he managed to travel to England, being forced to leave his family behind. Thanks to warm letters of recommendation from [[Jan Masaryk]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Karin Michaëlis|Karen Michaelis]] he obtained visas for his family and himself to emigrate to New Zealand. After travelling by separate routes he was united with his family in New Zealand. He settled in Auckland where he found employment with the Fletcher Construction Company. He was chief architect at Fletcher’s, designing numerous commercial buildings as well as private residences, until his retirement in 1960. From 1960 to his death in 1971 he designed and realised private houses prolifically. He died in Auckland in 1971 aged 71.

== Career ==

=== Early work ===
In 1919 after a brief period at the Technical University in Vienna, Henry Kulka began his studies at the Building School of the pioneer modern architect Adolf Loos.

Loos emphasized that all architecture should be related to human activity and evolve from it: form follows function. Loos was opposed to unnecessary ornamentation in architecture. He advocated the use of natural unadulterated materials and a respect for skilled craftsmanship. His designs included specifications of internal lining of quality materials such as stone marble and wood. The unique feature of Loos’s design was three dimensional planning later named Raumplan by Kulka and described in Kulka’s words;  “The rooms of his houses are situated on various levels, inter-related in harmonious proportions, space flowing into space, but forming a compact unit. The levels are not bound to a special floor (ground floor, first floor, etc.) and are not the result simply dividing a high room into mezzanine parts. The floors are inter-related rooms with open vistas, the levels connected by steps”&lt;ref&gt;Kulka, Henry ‘Adolf Loos: 1870-1933’, in Architects’ year book 9, ed. by Trevor Dannatt (London: Elek, 1957), pp. 7-29 (p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

As Kulka had an affinity for Loos’s thinking and had an aptitude to three dimensional planning, he became Loos’s assistant and later became his partner, further developing the Raumplan concept.

In 1922 Kulka assisted Loos on the realisation of the first cubic Raumplan house, the [[Rufer House|Villa Rufer]] in Hietzing Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Weissenbacher, Gerhard, ''In Hietzing gebaut'' vol. II (Vienna: Verlag Holzhausen, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1922 and 1923 Kulka designed, autonomously, a cubic Raumplan in smaller cubic dimensions than the Villa Rufer. Kulka's autonomously designed prototype became subsequently known as the Cubic, Dice or Würfelhaus, and was realised in Vienna by Kulka a decade later at 55 Künniglbergasse.&lt;ref&gt;Risselada, Max, ed., ''Raumplan versus Plan Libre'', 2nd English edn. (New York: Rizzoli,1988, repr. Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period 1923–1927 Kulka worked between Stuttgart, Vienna and Paris. Loos was based in Paris during this period. Kulka collaborated with Ernst Otto Oswald on the winning entry of the competition to design the Stuttgart Tagblatt Tower, which was built in 1927. In 1927 Kulka spent the year heading Loos’s office in Paris, leading the design of the Villa Moller Raumplan (after Loos and Kulka's colleague Zlatko Neuman had returned to Zagreb), the Paris Knize fashion botique and other unrealised projects such as the famous Raumplan Villa for [[Josephine Baker]]. 
In 1928 Kulka and Loos returned to Vienna and ran an atelier as full collaborating partners. Henry Kulka's wife, Hilda Kulka née Beran, was their practice manager during this period. In the last years of his life Loos was less active due to the deterioration of his health.

During those years the works often attributed to Loos such as the Khuner house of 1929 in Semmering, Austria were principally designed by Kulka. During that period Kulka was also involved in planning [[Villa Müller]] in Prague, and the Wien Werkbund Houses.

In 1930 Kulka authored the seminal monograph on Loos’s work; 'Adolf Loos: The work of the Architect' published by Anton Schroll Verlag.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Kulka, Adolf Loos: Das Werk des Architekten, (Vienna: Anton Schroll Verlag, 1931)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Late work in Europe ===
After Loos's death in 1933, Kulka continued and expanded their former architectural practice, maintaining their Vienna office and opening a second satellite office in Hradec Králové in Czechoslovakia to service commissions across Bohemia and Moravia.



Between 1932-1939 Kulka evolved new cubic Raumplan Villa and Apartment typologies. In addition to functionality, Kulka's approach was humanistic. He considered the feelings of  people inhabiting the space of his buildings, striving to give them a sense of harmony and well being.  Among these works are the 1932 Weissmann House in Hietzing Vienna, the 1933 Oskar Semler Raumplan Apartment in Pilsen, the 1934 Kantor Cubic Raumplan Villa in Jablonec, the 1934 small mountain Raumplan for Dr. Samuel Teichner in Spicak in Zelezna Ruda and the Villa Holzner Raumplan in Hronov, near Nachod. A fine example of Kulka’s Raumplan work at this time is the Villa Kantor, 1934. This cubic Raumplan was tailored to the requirements of a medical doctor who needed a functional consulting room nestled within the corpus of a comfortable family home. The exterior envelope of the building is cubic and rendered in fine stucco punctured by symmetrical fenestration in the front façade and a functional asymmetrical positioning of fenestration at the sides of the house. The symmetry of the façade is maintained through the use of a classical wall projection which accommodates internal circulation. The  interior of the Raumplan villa is clad with light colored woods and marble. The house has larger windows than Kulka’s villas with Loos. Kulka lets in more light and incorporates a lighter chromatic selection of cladding materials. It is in the more relaxed and subtle management of spatial transition that the Villa Kantor evolves raumplanning, and points toward changes Kulka would bring to his later work in New Zealand.

=== Work in New Zealand ===
Kulka understood that he could not transplant his European mode of operation to New Zealand.  He adapted remarkably well to the very different conditions of building, which included climate, construction methods, materials and availability of space. The compact style of building which characterized his more vertically oriented European work became less necessary. He retained many elements which characterized his European houses such as built in seating surrounding a fire place, built in furniture in the periphery of rooms, raised dining areas opening on living space and flat roofs. He had an extraordinary sense of quality and recognized the beauty of New Zealand wood, lining his houses with fine wooden paneling.Kulka said that he "wanted the interiors of his houses to look like the inside of a violin." At first his style was considered to be eccentric and provocative by the public but in later years it became emulated by young modern architects.



From 1940 until 1960 Kulka was the chief architect of the Fletcher Construction Company for whom he designed a large number of commercial and public buildings as well as private houses. His designs were diverse: family homes, bungalows, beach houses, bush batches, galleried houses, apartments, libraries, churches and monuments. These were largely realized in New Zealand, although he did build a limited amount of structures through Fletcher Building in Samoa, Tonga and Fiji.  Kulka followed changes to building technology closely and employed these new techniques in his commercial designs. Kulka is estimated to have designed and realized over 100 commercial structures throughout the period of New Zealand's post war industrialization. Characteristic  features of Kulka’s commercial structures include simple, solid facades and the avoidance of structural or decorative exhibitionism. His simple exterior envelopes accorded with a post war mood, which favoured civic modesty and utility. The reception and board rooms of these commercial structures were lined with indigenous wood and stone. Kulka introduced many innovations into his industrial designs including natural lighting and the introduction to New Zealand of the saw tooth factory ceiling. In the E. A Robinson building (1959) Kulka designed a double fenestration system so that offices within the deeper sections of that structure could benefit from internal glass facades which enabled natural light to permeate into these working spaces. In the entrance to Fletcher Building (1941-1942) Kulka designed a dramatic curved staircase lined with light marble and amber native wood.

Privately, Kulka realized over 40 fine wooden houses throughout New Zealand. His wooden houses were innovative in their spatial and material resolution. The Halberstam House in Wellington (1945) is an excellent example of Kulka’s ability to design compact minimal dwellings. The single level bungalow sits on top of a small hill in Wellington. It had a  very modest construction budget and post war building restrictions were imposed on the commissioners. Notwithstanding these constraints, Kulka built a striking cubic bungalow clad with dark stained weather boards on the exterior with the uplifting surprise of a luminous and calming interior consisting of fine honey coloured native wood panels and clean fibrous plaster. In this modest sized family home a small piano nobile is built subtly into the lounge. This niche is separated from the main body of the lounge by the minimal gesture of a bookcase which projects a little into the lounge. A small lowered ceiling above the nobile adds to the sense of separateness, snugness of this sub space.  Built in seating on either side of a fireplace are positioned toward the view of northerly hills, and the light. Cosiness, economy and functionality are brought together to achieve a sense of gentle refinement. Notwithstanding the Halberstam villa’s more modest scale compared to other Kulka Houses in New Zealand, it remains exemplary of the spirit of his work spatially and materially.

Kulka's prolific building throughout New Zealand continues to influence Modern Architecture in New Zealand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2857">The '''Interdisciplinary Telecommunications Program''' (its acronym is '''ITP''') is a part of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] and offers graduate degrees in [[telecommunications]]: a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] and [[Master of Science]] in Telecommunications and a [[Master of Engineering]] in Telecommunications.  It is the oldest telecommunications program in the United States and was founded in 1971 by Frank S. Barnes (Engineering) and George Codding (deceased, International Relations).  Since its inception, ITP has taken an [[interdisciplinary]] approach to telecommunications, involving the study of [[engineering]], [[law]], [[politics]], [[economics]] and [[business]].  Over the course of the past 35 years, ITP has graduated approximately 2,000 [[alumni]] who are in various positions around the world as [[CEO]]s, government officials, and management.

In 2004, ITP founder Frank S. Barnes was awarded the prestigious [[Gordon Prize]] for having founded ITP due to its innovative character and the influence that it has had within academia and industry.  As the first program of its kind in the United States, it broke ground for the many academic programs that followed. When [[Peterson's]] first started listing telecommunications programs in 1996, the director of ITP was asked to write the introduction on the topic for Peterson's publisher.  There is no question that many other prominent university programs have been directly influenced by ITP.  For further information, there is now a consortium of universities that teach the telecommunications discipline, known as [[ITERA]].

Students may participate in the program through either full-time academic study on campus or by participating in a distance-education platform.

The '''James Hutton Institute''' is an interdisciplinary scientific research institute in [[Scotland]] established in 2011, through the merger of [[Scottish Crop Research Institute]] (SCRI) and the [[Macaulay Institute|Macaulay Land Use Research Institute]]. The institute, named after Scottish [[geologist]] [[James Hutton]], one of the leading figures of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], combines existing Scottish expertise in [[agricultural research]], [[soil science|soils]] and [[land use]], and works in fields including [[food security|food]] and [[energy security]], [[biodiversity]], and [[climate change]]. With more than 600 employees, the institute is among the largest research centres in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://business.scotsman.com/business/New-centre-to-honour-39father.6619686.jp | title=New centre to honour 'father of geology' | date=9 November 2010 | accessdate=18 July 2016 | newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] under Scottish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SC041796|The James Hutton Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute has its main offices in [[Aberdeen]] and [[Dundee]] with farms and field research stations at [[Glensaugh]], [[Hartwood]] and [[Balruddery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQs|url=http://www.hutton.ac.uk/about/faqs|website=Hutton.ac.uk|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dundee site also hosts the Plant Sciences department of the [[University of Dundee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee|title=Plant Sciences|url=http://www.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/research/ps|website=LifeSci.Dundee.ac.uk|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The James Hutton Institute also formally contains '''Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland''' (BioSS) which has staff based in [[Edinburgh]], [[Dundee]], [[Aberdeen]] and [[Ayr]]. BioSS undertakes research, consultancy and training in mathematics and statistics as applied to agriculture, the environment, food and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BioSS: Home Page|url=http://www.bioss.ac.uk/|website=BioSS.ac.uk|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strategic oversight of the development of BioSS is provided by a Strategic Planning Group composed of senior representatives from BioSS' principal stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Biomathematics &amp; Statistics Scotland|title=Corporate Plan 2012-2016|url=http://www.bioss.ac.uk/BioSS_Corporate_Plan_2012.pdf|website=BioSS.ac.uk|publisher=Biomathematics &amp; Statistics Scotland|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BioSS and the James Hutton Institute are two of a family of six organisations termed the Main Research Providers for the [[Scottish Government]] Rural and Environment Research and Analytical Services Division (RESAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=The Scottish Government|title=Rural Affairs, Food and the Environment - Main Research Providers|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Research/About/EBAR/research-providers|website=Gov.Scot|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the Institute announced that it was formally joining the [[Natural Capital Initiative]], a leading UK partnership that brings together policymakers, scientists, business, industry to find the most effective ways safeguard important ecosystems and [[natural capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=James Hutton Institute joins the Natural Capital Initiative|url=http://www.hutton.ac.uk/news/james-hutton-institute-joins-natural-capital-initiative|website=Hutton.ac.uk|accessdate=18 July 2016|date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cattle poison.jpg|thumb|280px|Australia, 1907: cattlemen survey 700 carcasses of cattle that were killed overnight by a poisonous plant]]

Poisonous plants are those plants that produce toxins that deter herbivores from consuming them. Plants cannot move to escape their predators, so they must have other means of protecting themselves from herbivorous animals. Some plants have physical defenses such as [[thorns, spines and prickles]], but by far the most common type of protection is chemical.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2007. [https://www.amazon.com/Plants-Vegetation-Origins-Processes-Consequences/dp/0521864801 Plants and Vegetation: Origins, Processes, Consequences]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 666 p. Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Over millennia, through the process of [[natural selection]], plants have [[evolution of plants|evolved]] the means to produce a vast and complicated array of chemical compounds in order to deter herbivores. [[Tannin]], for example, is a defensive compound that emerged relatively early in the evolutionary history of plants, while more complex molecules such as [[polyyne|polyacetylenes]] are found in younger groups of plants such as the [[Asterales]]. Many of the known [[Plant defense against herbivory|plant defense compounds]] primarily defend against consumption by insects, though other animals, including humans, that consume such plants may also experience negative effects, ranging from mild discomfort to death.

Many of these poisonous compounds also have important medicinal benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, W.H. and M.P.F. Elvin-Lewis. 1977. Medical Botany. Plants Affecting Man's Health. Wiley, New York. 515 p. p. 123-124.&lt;/ref&gt; The varieties of [[phytochemistry|phytochemical]] defenses in plants are so numerous that many questions about them remain unanswered, including:

# Which plants have which types of defense?
# Which herbivores, specifically, are the plants defended against?
# What chemical structures and mechanisms of toxicity are involved in the compounds that provide defense?
# What are the potential medical uses of these compounds?

These questions and others constitute an active area of research in modern [[botany]], with important implications for understanding plant evolution and for medical science.

Below is an extensive, if incomplete, list of [[plant]]s containing [[poison]]ous parts that pose a serious risk of [[disease|illness]], injury, or [[death]] to [[human]]s or [[animal]]s. There is significant overlap between plants considered poisonous and those with [[psychedelic plants|psychotropic properties]], some of which are toxic enough to present serious health risks at recreational doses. It is also important to remember that there is a distinction between plants that are poisonous because they naturally produce dangerous phytochemicals, and those that may become dangerous for other reasons, including but not limited to infection by bacterial, viral, or fungal parasites, the uptake of [[phytotoxin|toxic compounds]] through contaminated soil or groundwater, and/or the ordinary processes of decay after the plant has died; this list deals exclusively with the former. Many plants, such as [[peanut]]s, also produce compounds that are only dangerous to people who have developed an [[allergy|allergic reaction]] to them, and with a few exceptions, those plants are not included on this list (see [[list of allergens]] instead). Human fatalities caused by poisonous plants – especially resulting from accidental ingestion – are rare in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Krenzelok EP, Mrvos R.,"Friends and foes in the plant world: A profile of plant ingestions and fatalities."  Clin Toxicol. 2011 Mar;49(3):142-9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poisonous food plants ==

Many plants commonly used as food possess toxic parts, are toxic unless processed, or are toxic at certain stages of their lives. Some only pose a serious threat to certain animals (such as cats, dogs, or livestock) or certain types of people (such as infants, the elderly, or individuals with pathological vulnerabilities). Most of these food plants are safe for the average adult to eat in modest quantities. Notable examples include:

| [[Apple]]
| ''[[Malus domestica]]''
| Seeds are mildly poisonous, containing a small amount of [[amygdalin]], a [[cyanide|cyanogenic]] [[glycoside]]. The quantity contained is usually not enough to be dangerous to humans, but it is possible to ingest enough seeds to provide a fatal dose.

|-
| [[Asparagus]]
| ''[[Asparagus officinalis]]''
| Several species including ''[[Asparagus officinalis]]'' and ''[[Asparagus densiflorus]]''. Though asparagus plants cultivated for food are typically harvested before they reach reproductive maturity, the berries of the mature plant are poisonous, containing furostanol and spirostanol [[saponin]]s. Rapid ingestion of more than five to seven ripe berries can induce abdominal pain and vomiting. Sulfur compounds in the young shoots are also considered at least partially responsible for mild skin reactions in some people who handle the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gardengrow.co.nz/plant/Asparagus |title=Growing Asparagus |publisher=gardengrow.co.nz |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asparagus-friends.com/asparagus-knowledge/poisonous-asparagus/ |title=Poisonous Asparagus |publisher=asparagus-friends.com |accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Cassava]]
| ''[[Manihot esculenta]]''
| Roots and leaves contain two [[cyanogenic glycoside]]s, [[linamarin]] and [[lotaustralin]]. These are decomposed by [[linamarase]], a naturally occurring [[enzyme]] in cassava, liberating [[hydrogen cyanide]] .&lt;ref name="cereda"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cereda | first1 = M. P. | last2 = Mattos | first2 = M. C. Y. | title = Linamarin: the Toxic Compound of Cassava | journal = Journal of Venomous Animals and Toxins | volume = 2 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1590/S0104-79301996000100002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cassava varieties are often categorized as either sweet or bitter, respectively signifying the absence or presence of toxic levels of cyanogenic glycosides. The 'sweet' cultivars can produce as little as 20 milligrams of [[cyanide]] per kilogram of fresh roots, whereas bitter ones may produce more than 50 times as much (1&amp;nbsp;g/kg). Cassavas grown during [[drought]] are especially high in these toxins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aregheore EM, Agunbiade OO | title = The toxic effects of cassava (manihot esculenta grantz) diets on humans: a review. | journal = Vet.

It can also cause severe calcific pancreatitis in humans, leading to chronic pancreatitis. Processing (soaking, cooking, fermentation, etc.) of cassava root is necessary to remove the toxins and avoid getting sick. In the tropics, where cassava farming is a major industry, "Chronic, low-level cyanide exposure is associated with the development of [[goiter]] and with tropical ataxic neuropathy, a nerve-damaging disorder that renders a person unsteady and uncoordinated. Severe cyanide poisoning, particularly during famines, is associated with outbreaks of a debilitating, irreversible paralytic disorder called [[konzo]] and, in some cases, death. The incidence of konzo and tropical ataxic neuropathy can be as high as 3 percent in some areas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The cyanide is carried away in the processing water and the amounts produced in domestic consumption are too small to have environmental impact.&lt;ref name="cereda" /&gt; The larger-rooted, bitter varieties used for production of flour or starch must be processed to remove the cyanogenic glycosides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Padmaja G | title = Cyanide detoxification in cassava for food and feed uses | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 299–339 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7576161 | doi = 10.1080/10408399509527703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial production of cassava flour, even at the cottage level, may generate enough cyanide and cyanogenic glycosides in the effluvia to have a severe environmental impact.&lt;ref name="cereda" /&gt;

| ''[[Prunus cerasus]]''
| As well as other ''[[Prunus]]'' species such as [[peach]] (''Prunus persica''), [[plum]] (''Prunus domestica''), [[almond]] (''Prunus dulcis''), and [[apricot]] (''Prunus armeniaca''). Leaves and seeds contain [[amygdalin]], a [[cyanogenic glycoside]].

| ''[[Lathyrus sativus]]''
| A legume grown in Asia and East Africa as an insurance crop for use during famines. Like other grain legumes, ''L. sativus'' produces a high-protein seed. The seeds contain variable amounts of [[Oxalyldiaminopropionic acid|β-N-Oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid]] or ODAP, a [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] [[amino acid]].&lt;ref name="pmid14155110"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Rao SL, Adiga PR, Sarma PS | title = The Isolation and Characterization of β-N-Oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid: A Neurotoxin from the Seeds of Lathyrus sativus | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 432–6 | year = 1964 | pmid = 14155110 | doi = 10.1021/bi00891a022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ODAP causes wasting and [[paralysis]] if eaten over a long period, and is considered the cause of the disease [[neurolathyrism]], a [[neurodegenerative]] disease that causes paralysis of the lower body and emaciation of gluteal muscle (buttocks). The disease has been seen to occur after [[famine]]s in Europe (France, Spain, Germany), North Africa and South Asia, and is still prevalent in Eritrea, Ethiopia and parts of Afghanistan when ''Lathyrus'' seed is the exclusive or main source of nutrients for extended periods.

| [[Common bean#Red or kidney beans|Kidney bean]] or ''common bean''
| ''[[Phaseolus vulgaris]]''
|  The toxic compound [[phytohaemagglutinin]], a [[lectin]], is present in many varieties of common bean but is especially concentrated in red kidney beans. The lectin has a number of effects on cell metabolism; it induces [[mitosis]], and affects the cell membrane in regard to transport and [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] to proteins. It [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutinates]] most mammalian [[red blood cell]] types. Consumption of as few as four or five raw kidney beans may be sufficient to trigger symptoms, which include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Onset is from 1 to 3 hours after consumption of improperly prepared beans, and symptoms typically resolve within a few hours.&lt;ref name=FDA /&gt; Phytohaemagglutinin can be deactivated by cooking beans at {{convert|100|°C|°F}} for ten minutes, which is required to degrade the toxin and is much shorter than the hours required to fully cook the beans themselves. For dry beans the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) also recommends an initial soak of at least 5 hours in water, after which the soaking water should be discarded.&lt;ref name=FDA&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=11 July 2009 |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm071092.htm |title=Foodborne Pathogenic Microorganisms and Natural Toxins Handbook: Phytohaemagglutinin |work=[[Bad Bug Book]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, lower cooking temperatures may have the paradoxical effect of potentiating the toxic effect of haemagglutinin. Beans cooked at {{convert|80|°C|°F}} are reported to be up to five times as toxic as raw beans.&lt;ref name=FDA /&gt; Outbreaks of poisoning have been associated with the use of [[slow cooker]]s, the low cooking temperatures of which may be unable to degrade the toxin.

| ''[[Mangifera indica]]''
| Mango peel and sap contain [[urushiol]], the allergen in poison ivy and poison sumac that can cause [[urushiol-induced contact dermatitis]] in susceptible people. Cross-reactions between mango contact allergens and urushiol have been observed. Those with a history of poison ivy or poison oak contact dermatitis may be most at risk for such an allergic reaction. Urushiol is also present in mango leaves and stems. During mango's primary ripening season, it is the most common source of plant dermatitis in Hawaii.

| [[Allium|Onions and garlic]]
| ''[[Allium]]'' spp.
| Many members of the genus ''Allium'' contain [[thiosulphate]], which in high doses is toxic to dogs, cats and some types of livestock. Cats are more sensitive.

|-
| [[Potato]]
| ''[[Solanum tuberosum]]''
| Potatoes contain toxic compounds known as [[glycoalkaloid]]s, of which the most prevalent are [[solanine]] and [[chaconine]]. Solanine is also found in other members of the [[Solanaceae]] plant family, which includes ''Atropa belladonna'' ("deadly nightshade") and ''Hyoscyamus niger'' ("henbane") (see entries below). The concentration of glycoalkaloid in wild potatoes is sufficient to produce toxic effects in humans. The toxin affects the nervous system, causing [[headache]]s, [[diarrhea]] and intense digestive disturbances, [[cramps]], weakness and confusion, and in severe cases [[coma]] and death. Poisoning from cultivated potatoes occurs very rarely, however, as toxic compounds in the potato plant are generally concentrated in the green portions of the plant and in the fruits, and cultivated varieties contain smaller concentrations than wild plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tomato-like Fruit on Potato Plants |publisher=[[Iowa State University]] |url=http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/hortnews/2004/7-2-2004/tomatopotato.html |accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Glycoalkaloid and calystegine contents of eight potato cultivars''[http://grande.nal.usda.gov/ibids/index.php?mode2=detail&amp;origin=ibids_references&amp;therow=728718 J-Agric-Food-Chem. 2003 May 7; 51(10): 2964–73] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211003132/http://grande.nal.usda.gov/ibids/index.php?mode2=detail&amp;origin=ibids_references&amp;therow=728718 |date=11 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooking at high temperatures (over 170&amp;nbsp;°C or 340&amp;nbsp;°F) also partly destroys the toxin. However, exposure to light, physical damage, and age can increase glycoalkaloid content within the tuber,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greening of potatoes |publisher=Food Science Australia |year=2005 |url=http://www.foodscience.afisc.csiro.au/spuds.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990224092343/http://www.foodscience.afisc.csiro.au/spuds.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 February 1999 |accessdate=15 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the highest concentrations occurring just underneath the skin. Tubers that are exposed to light turn green from [[chlorophyll]] synthesis, thus giving a visual clue as to areas of the tuber that may have become more toxic; however, this does not provide a definitive guide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other. Some varieties of potato contain greater glycoalkaloid concentrations than others; breeders developing new varieties test for this, and sometimes have to discard an otherwise promising [[cultivar]]. Breeders try to keep solanine levels below 200&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (200 ppmw). However, when these commercial varieties turn green, even they can approach concentrations of solanine of 1000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (1000 ppmw). The [[U.S. National Toxicology Program]] suggests that the average American consume no more than 12.5&amp;nbsp;mg/day of solanine from potatoes (the toxic dose is actually several times this, depending on body weight).

| [[Rhubarb]]
| ''[[Rheum rhaponticum]]''
| The leaf stalks ([[petiole (botany)|petioles]]) are edible, but the leaves themselves contain notable quantities of [[oxalic acid]], which is a [[nephrotoxic]] and [[corrosive]] acid present in many plants. Symptoms of poisoning include kidney disorders, convulsions and coma, though it is rarely fatal. The {{LD50}} (median lethal dose) for pure oxalic acid in rats is about 375&amp;nbsp;mg/kg [[body weight]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhurbarb poisoning on rhurbabinfo.com|url=http://www.rhubarbinfo.com/rhubarb-poison.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; or about 25 grams for a 65&amp;nbsp;kg (~140&amp;nbsp;lb) human.

| '''''[[Aconitum]]''''' '''genus'''
| Several species, commonly called '''aconite''', '''wolfsbane''' and '''monkshood'''. All parts are poisonous. The poison is an alkaloid called [[aconitine]], which disables nerves, lowers blood pressure, and can stop the heart. Even casual skin contact should be avoided; symptoms include numbness, tingling, and cardiac irregularity. It has been used as poison for bullets (by German forces during World War II), as a bait and arrow poison (ancient Greece), and to poison water supplies (reports from ancient Asia).{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} If ingested, it usually causes burning, tingling, and numbness in the mouth, followed by vomiting and nervous excitement. It is usually a quick-acting poison, and has been used in the past for killing wolves (hence one of the common names).

Horses do not normally eat fresh ragwort due to its bitter taste, however it loses this taste when dried, and becomes dangerous in hay. The result, if sufficient quantity is consumed, can be irreversible [[cirrhosis]] of the liver. Signs that a horse has been poisoned include yellow mucus membranes, depression, and lack of coordination. The danger is that the toxin can have a cumulative effect; the alkaloid does not actually accumulate in the liver but a breakdown product can damage [[DNA]] and progressively kills cells. ''Jacobaea vulgaris'' is also theoretically poisonous to humans, although poisoning is unlikely as it is distasteful and not used as a food. However, some sensitive individuals can suffer from an allergic skin reaction after handling the plant because, like many members of the family Compositae, it contains sesquiterpine [[lactone]]s (which are different from the [[pyrrolizidine alkaloids]] responsible for the toxic effects), which can cause compositae dermatitis.

| '''''[[Phoradendron]]''''' '''genus'''
| Commonly known as '''American mistletoe'''; see also the related genus ''[[Viscum]]''). Mistletoe is a common [[hemiparasite]] of trees and shrubs. Toxicity varies by species, but all parts of the plant, especially the leaves and berries, contain an array of dangerous chemicals, including proteins called phoratoxins and toxic alkaloids. Symptoms are very similar to those produced by ''Viscum'' species and may include acute gastrointestinal discomfort, diarrhea, weak pulse and/or [[bradycardia|slow heart rate]], and even seizures; it is rarely lethal to adult humans, however, and many wild animals are adapted to eating its fruit.

| '''''[[Toxicodendron]]''''' '''genus'''
| Several species, including ''[[Toxicodendron radicans]]'' commonly known as '''poison ivy''', ''[[Toxicodendron diversilobum]]'' commonly known as '''poison-oak''', and ''[[Poison sumac|Toxicodendron vernix]]'' commonly known as '''poison sumac'''. All parts of these plants contain a highly irritating oil with [[urushiol]]. Skin reactions can include blisters and rashes. The oil spreads readily to clothes and back again, and has a very long life. Infections can follow scratching. Despite the common names, urushiol is actually not a poison but an [[allergen]], and because of this it will not affect certain people. The smoke of burning poison ivy can cause reactions in the lungs, and can be fatal. The [[urushiol-induced contact dermatitis|allergic reaction]] caused by contact with [[Toxicodendron radicans|poison ivy]] afflicts more than 70% of the human population, with as many as 350,000 cases reported annually in the United States alone

Some domestic animals will avoid consuming the plant if other forage is present, but less discriminating animals, such as pigs, will consume the plants and then sicken and die. The seedlings and seeds are the most toxic parts of the plants. Symptoms usually occur within a few hours, producing unsteadiness and weakness, depression, [[nausea]] and vomiting, twisting of the neck muscles, rapid and weak pulse, difficulty breathing, and eventually death. ''Xanthium'' has also been used for its medicinal properties and for making yellow dye, as indicated by its name (Greek ''xanthos'' = 'yellow').

'''Mathematics and art''' are related in a variety of ways. [[Mathematics]] has itself been described as an [[art]] [[mathematical beauty|motivated by beauty]]. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as [[Music and mathematics|music]], [[dance]], [[painting]], [[Mathematics and architecture|architecture]], [[sculpture]], and [[Mathematics and fiber arts|textiles]]. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.

Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. [[List of mathematical artists|Artists have used mathematics]] since the 4th century BC when the Greek [[sculpture|sculptor]] [[Polykleitos]] wrote his ''Canon'', prescribing proportions based on the ratio 1:{{radic|2}} for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the [[golden ratio]] in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian [[Renaissance]], [[Luca Pacioli]] wrote the influential treatise ''[[De Divina Proportione]]'' (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, [[Piero della Francesca]], developed [[Euclid]]'s ideas on [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] in treatises such as ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', and in his paintings. The engraver [[Albrecht Dürer]] made many references to mathematics in his work ''[[Melencolia I]]''. In modern times, the [[graphic artist]] [[M. C. Escher]] made intensive use of [[tessellation]] and [[hyperbolic geometry]], with the help of the mathematician [[H. S. M. Coxeter]], while the [[De Stijl]] movement led by [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as [[quilting]], [[knitting]], [[cross-stitch]], [[crochet]], [[embroidery]], [[weaving]], [[Turkish carpet|Turkish]] and other [[carpet]]-making, as well as [[kilim]]. In [[Islamic art]], symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian [[girih]] and Moroccan [[zellige]] tilework, [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] [[jali]] pierced stone screens, and widespread [[muqarnas]] vaulting.

Mathematics has directly influenced art with conceptual tools such as [[linear perspective]], the analysis of [[symmetry]], and mathematical objects such as [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] and the [[Möbius strip]]. [[Magnus Wenninger]] creates colourful [[stellation|stellated polyhedra]], originally as models for teaching. Mathematical concepts such as [[recursion]] and logical paradox can be seen in paintings by [[Rene Magritte]] and in engravings by M. C. Escher. [[Computer art]] often makes use of [[fractal]]s including the [[Mandelbrot set]], and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as [[cellular automata]]. Controversially, the artist [[David Hockney]] has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use of the [[camera lucida]] to draw precise representations of scenes; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that [[Vermeer]] used the [[camera obscura]] in his distinctively observed paintings.

Other relationships include the algorithmic analysis of artworks by [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], the finding that traditional [[batik]]s from different regions of [[Java]] have distinct [[fractal dimension]]s, and stimuli to mathematics research, especially [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s theory of perspective, which eventually led to [[Girard Desargues]]'s [[projective geometry]]. A persistent view, based ultimately on the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's [[sacred geometry|geometry is sacred]], as seen in artworks such as [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Ancient of Days]]''.

===Polykleitos's ''Canon'' and ''symmetria''===

{{further information|Polykleitos}}

[[Polykleitos]] the elder (c.450–420 BC) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[sculptor]] from the school of [[Argos]], and a contemporary of [[Phidias]]. His works and statues consisted mainly of bronze and were of athletes. According to the philosopher and mathematician [[Xenocrates]], Polykleitos is ranked as one of the most important sculptors of [[Classical antiquity]] for his work on the ''[[Doryphorus]]'' and the statue of [[Hera]] in the [[Heraion of Argos]].&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=Andrew |title=Polykleitos of Argos," One Hundred Greek Sculptors: Their Careers and Extant Works |journal=[[Journal of Hellenic Studies]] |date=November 1978 |volume=98 |pages=122–131 |doi=10.2307/630196|jstor=630196}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his sculptures may not be as famous as those of Phidias, they are much admired. In the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos, a treatise he wrote designed to document the "perfect" [[anatomy|anatomical]] proportions of the male nude, Polykleitos gives us a mathematical approach towards sculpturing the human body.&lt;ref name=Stewart/&gt;

Polykleitos uses the [[distal phalanges|distal phalanx]] of the [[little finger]] as the basic module for determining the proportions of the human body.&lt;ref name=Tobin&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tobin, Richard |title=The ''Canon'' of Polykleitos |journal=[[American Journal of Archaeology]] |volume=79 |issue=4 |date=October 1975 |pages=307–321 |doi=10.2307/503064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polykleitos multiplies the length of the distal phalanx by the [[square root of two]] ({{radic|2}}) to get the distance of the [[intermediate phalanges|second phalanges]] and multiplies the length again by {{radic|2}} to get the length of the [[proximal phalanges|third phalanges]]. Next, he takes the [[finger]] length and multiplies that by {{radic|2}} to get the length of the palm from the base of the finger to the [[ulna]]. This [[geometric series]] of measurements progresses until Polykleitos has formed the arm, chest, body, and so on.&lt;ref name=Lawton&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lawton |first1=Arthur J. |title=Pattern, Tradition and Innovation in Vernacular Architecture |journal=Past |date=2013 |volume=36 |url=http://www.pioneeramerica.org/past2013/past2013artlawton.html |quote=The base figure is a square the length and width of the distal phalange of the little finger.

Rotating the medial diagonal proportions the proximal phalange and similarly from there to the wrist, from wrist to elbow and from elbow to shoulder top. Each new step advances the diagonal's pivot point.|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos is immense in [[Classical Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Renaissance]] sculpture, many sculptors following Polykleitos's prescription. While none of Polykleitos's original works survive, Roman copies demonstrate his ideal of physical perfection and mathematical precision. Some scholars argue that [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] thought influenced the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos.&lt;ref name=Raven&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raven |first1=J. E. |title=Polyclitus and Pythagoreanism |journal=[[Classical Quarterly]] |date=1951 |volume=1|issue=3–4 |pages=147– |doi=10.1017/s0009838800004122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Canon'' applies the basic mathematical concepts of Greek geometry, such as the ratio, proportion, and ''symmetria'' (Greek for "harmonious proportions") and turns it into a system capable of describing the human form through a series of continuous [[geometric series|geometric progressions]].&lt;ref name=Tobin/&gt;

===Perspective and proportion===
{{main article|Perspective (graphical)}}

[[File:Brunelleschi's perspective experiment.jpg|thumb|[[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]'s experiment with [[linear perspective]]]]

In classical times, rather than making distant figures smaller with [[linear perspective]], painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance. In the Middle Ages, some artists used [[reverse perspective]] for special emphasis. The Muslim mathematician [[Alhazen]] (Ibn al-Haytham) described a theory of optics in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' in 1021, but never applied it to art.&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt; The [[Renaissance]] saw a rebirth of [[Classical Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] culture and ideas, among them the study of mathematics to understand [[nature]] and the [[arts]]. Two major motives drove artists in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance towards mathematics. First, painters needed to figure out how to depict three-dimensional scenes on a two-dimensional canvas. Second, philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was the true essence of the physical world and that the entire universe, including the arts, could be explained in geometric terms.&lt;ref name=Emmer&gt;{{cite book |editor=Emmer, Michelle |title=The Visual Mind II |publisher=MIT Press |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-262-05048-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rudiments of perspective arrived with [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] (1266/7 – 1337), who attempted to draw in perspective using an algebraic method to determine the placement of distant lines. In 1415, the Italian [[architect]] [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and his friend [[Leon Battista Alberti]] demonstrated the geometrical method of applying perspective in Florence, using [[similar triangles]] as formulated by Euclid, to find the apparent height of distant objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vasari, Giorgio |authorlink=Giorgio Vasari |date=1550 |title=[[Lives of the Artists]] |publisher=Torrentino |page=Chapter on Brunelleschi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alberti |first1=Leon Battista |last2=Spencer |first2=John R. |title=On Painting |date=1956 |publisher=Yale University Press |origyear=1435|url=http://www.noteaccess.com/Texts/Alberti/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunelleschi's own perspective paintings are lost, but [[Masaccio]]'s painting of the Holy Trinity shows his principles at work.&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Field |first1=J.

The painter [[Piero della Francesca]] (c.1415–1492) exemplified this new shift in Italian Renaissance thinking. He was an expert [[mathematician]] and [[geometer]], writing books on [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], including ''[[De Prospectiva Pingendi]] (On Perspective for Painting)'', ''Trattato d'Abaco (Abacus Treatise)'', and ''De corporibus regularibus (On Regular Solids)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=della Francesca, Piero |title=De Prospectiva Pingendi |editor=G.

Milanesi |date=1878 |page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piero's interest in perspective can be seen in his paintings including the [[Polyptych of Perugia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zuffi |first=Stefano  |title=Piero della Francesca |publisher=L'Unità – Mondadori Arte |year=1991 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''San Agostino altarpiece'' and ''[[The Flagellation of Christ]]''. His work on geometry influenced later mathematicians and artists including [[Luca Pacioli]] in his ''De Divina Proportione'' and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Piero studied classical mathematics and the works of [[Archimedes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Heath, T.L. |title=The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1908 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taught commercial arithmetic in "abacus schools"; his writings are formatted like abacus school textbooks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grendler, P. |title=What Piero Learned in School: Fifteenth-Century Vernacular Education |work=Piero della Francesca and His Legacy |editor=M.A. Lavin |publisher=University Press of New England |year=1995 |pages=161–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps including Leonardo Pisano ([[Fibonacci]])'s 1202 ''[[Liber Abaci]]''. [[Linear perspective]] was just being introduced into the artistic world. Alberti explained in his 1435 ''[[De pictura]]'': "light rays travel in straight lines from points in the observed scene to the eye, forming a kind of [[pyramid]] with the eye as vertex." A painting constructed with linear perspective is a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of that pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alberti, Leon Battista |title=On Painting |editor= Kemp, Martin |author2=Grayson, Cecil (trans.) |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', Piero transforms his empirical observations of the way aspects of a figure change with point of view into mathematical proofs. His treatise starts in the vein of Euclid: he defines the point as "the tiniest thing that is possible for the eye to comprehend".{{efn|In Piero's Italian: "una cosa tanto picholina quanto e possible ad ochio comprendere".}}&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt; He uses [[deductive logic]] to lead the reader to the perspective representation of a three-dimensional body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Peterson, Mark |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/mac/Italian/geometry.shtml |title=The Geometry of Piero della Francesca |quote=In Book I, after some elementary constructions to introduce the idea of the apparent size of an object being actually its angle subtended at the eye, and referring to Euclid's Elements Books I and VI, and Euclid's Optics, he turns, in Proposition 13, to the representation of a square lying flat on the ground in front of the viewer. What should the artist actually draw? After this, objects are constructed in the square (tilings, for example, to represent a tiled floor), and corresponding objects are constructed in perspective; in Book II prisms are erected over these planar objects, to represent houses, columns, etc.; but the basis of the method is the original square, from which everything else follows.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[David Hockney]] [[Hockney-Falco thesis|argued]] in his book ''[[Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters]]'' that artists started using a [[camera lucida]] from the 1420s, resulting in a sudden change in precision and realism, and that this practice was continued by major artists including [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[Jan van Eyck|Van Eyck]], and [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hockney |first=David |title=Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters |year=2006 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-28638-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics disagree on whether Hockney was correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Van Riper |first1=Frank |title=Hockney's 'Lucid' Bomb At the Art Establishment |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/photo/essays/vanRiper/030220.htm |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marr |first1=Andrew |title=What the eye didn't see |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/oct/07/featuresreview.review1 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=7 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the architect Philip Steadman argued controversially&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Janson |first1=Jonathan |title=An Interview with Philip Steadman |url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/interviews_newsletter/steadman_interview.html#.VeqxKJdUWHg |publisher=Essential Vermeer |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=25 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Vermeer]] had used a different device, the [[camera obscura]], to help him create his distinctively observed paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steadman |first1=Philip |title=Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth Behind the Masterpieces |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280302-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1509, [[Luca Pacioli]] (c. 1447–1517) published ''[[De divina proportione]]'' on [[mathematical]] and [[artistic]] [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]], including in the human face. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) illustrated the text with woodcuts of regular solids while he studied under Pacioli in the 1490s. Leonardo's drawings are probably the first illustrations of skeletonic solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/pacioli.html |title=Luca Pacioli's Polyhedra |author=Hart, George |authorlink=George W.

As early as the 15th century, [[curvilinear perspective]] found its way into paintings by artists interested in image distortions. [[Jan van Eyck]]'s 1434 ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' contains a convex mirror with reflections of the people in the scene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Criminisi, A. |author2=Kempz, M. |author3=Kang, S.

Three-dimensional space can be represented convincingly in art, as in [[technical drawing]], by means other than perspective. [[Oblique projection]]s, including cavalier perspective (used by French military artists to depict fortifications in the 18th century), were used continuously and ubiquitously by Chinese artists from the first or second centuries until the 18th century. The Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from Ancient Rome. Oblique projection is seen in Japanese art, such as in the [[Ukiyo-e]] paintings of [[Torii Kiyonaga]] (1752–1815).&lt;ref name=Cucker269&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=269–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

an irrational number which is approximately 1.325.

===Planar symmetries===

[[Planar symmetry|Planar symmetries]] have for millennia been exploited in artworks such as [[carpet]]s, lattices, textiles and tilings.&lt;ref name=Cucker89/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lerner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellison/&gt;&lt;ref name=Castera/&gt;

Many traditional rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave [[kilim]]s, are divided into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver.&lt;ref name=Cucker89&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=89–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; In kilims from [[Anatolia]], the [[motif (textile arts)|motifs]] used are themselves usually symmetrical. The general layout, too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating with rows of motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly laid out as a wallpaper with a [[wallpaper group]] such as pmm, while the border may be laid out as a frieze of [[frieze group]] pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.&lt;ref name=Cucker89/&gt;
The mathematician and architectural theorist [[Nikos Salingaros]] suggests that the "powerful presence"&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; (aesthetic effect) of a "great carpet"&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; such as the best Konya two-medallion carpets of the 17th century is created by mathematical techniques related to the theories of the architect [[Christopher Alexander]]. These techniques include making opposites couple; opposing colour values; differentiating areas geometrically, whether by using complementary shapes or balancing the directionality of sharp angles; providing small-scale complexity (from the knot level upwards) and both small- and large-scale symmetry; repeating elements at a hierarchy of different scales (with a ratio of about 2.7 from each level to the next).

[[Islamic art]] [[Islamic geometric patterns|exploits symmetries]] in many of its artforms, notably in [[girih tiles|girih]] tilings. These are formed using a set of five tile shapes, namely a regular decagon, an elongated hexagon, a bow tie, a rhombus, and a regular pentagon. All the sides of these tiles have the same length; and all their angles are multiples of 36° (π/5 [[radian]]s), offering fivefold and tenfold symmetries. The tiles are decorated with [[strapwork]] lines (girih), generally more visible than the tile boundaries. In 2007, the physicists [[Peter Lu]] and [[Paul Steinhardt]]  argued that girih resembled [[quasicrystalline]] [[Penrose tiling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lu, Peter J. |author2=Steinhardt, Paul J. |year=2007 |title=Decagonal and Quasi-crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=315 |pages=1106–1110 |doi=10.1126/science.1135491 |pmid=17322056 |issue=5815 |bibcode=2007Sci...315.1106L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborate geometric [[zellige]] tilework is a distinctive element in [[Morocco|Moroccan]] architecture.&lt;ref name=Castera&gt;{{cite book |last1=Castera |first1=Jean Marc |last2=Peuriot |first2=Francoise |title=Arabesques.

===Polyhedra===
[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|The first printed illustration of a [[rhombicuboctahedron]], by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], published in ''[[De Divina Proportione]]'', 1509]]

The [[Platonic solid]]s and other [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] are a recurring theme in Western art. They are found, for instance, in a marble mosaic featuring the [[small stellated dodecahedron]], attributed to Paolo Uccello, in the floor of the [[San Marco di Venezia|San Marco Basilica]] in Venice;&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; in Leonardo da Vinci's diagrams of regular polyhedra drawn as illustrations for [[Luca Pacioli]]'s 1509 book ''The Divine Proportion'';&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; as a glass [[rhombicuboctahedron]] in Jacopo de Barbari's portrait of Pacioli, painted in 1495;&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; in the truncated polyhedron (and various other mathematical objects) in [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s engraving [[Melencolia I]];&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; and in [[Salvador Dalí]]'s painting ''The Last Supper'' in which Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant [[dodecahedron]].

[[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528) was a [[German people|German]] [[Renaissance]] [[printmaker]] who made important contributions to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book, ''Underweysung der Messung (Education on Measurement)'', meant to teach the subjects of [[linear perspective]], [[geometry]] in [[architecture]], [[Platonic solids]], and [[regular polygons]]. Dürer was likely influenced by the works of [[Luca Pacioli]] and [[Piero della Francesca]] during his trips to [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Panofsky, E. |title=The Life and Art of Albrecht Durer |publisher=Princeton |year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the examples of perspective in ''Underweysung der Messung'' are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies, there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra. Dürer is also the first to introduce in text the idea of [[Net (polyhedron)|polyhedral nets]], polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hart, George W. |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/durer.html |title=Dürer's Polyhedra |accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer published another influential book on [[human proportions]] called ''Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion (Four Books on Human Proportion)'' in 1528.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dürer |first1=Albrecht |title=Hierinn sind begriffen vier Bucher von menschlicher Proportion|url=https://archive.org/details/hierinnsindbegri00dure |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=24 June 2015 |location=Nurenberg |date=1528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fractal dimensions===

[[File:Batik pedalaman - parang klithik.JPG|thumb|[[Batik]]s from [[Surakarta]], Java, like this ''parang klithik'' sword pattern, have a [[fractal dimension]] between 1.2 and 1.5.]]

Traditional Indonesian wax-resist [[batik]] designs on cloth combine [[representation (arts)|representational]] motifs (such as floral and vegetal elements) with abstract and somewhat chaotic elements, including imprecision in applying the wax resist, and random variation introduced by cracking of the wax. Batik designs have a [[fractal dimension]] between 1 and 2, varying in different regional styles. For example, the batik of [[Cirebon]] has a fractal dimension of 1.1; the batiks of [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta]] (Solo) in Central [[Java]] have a fractal dimension of 1.2 to 1.5; and the batiks of [[Rembang Regency|Lasem]] on the north coast of Java and of [[Tasikmalaya]] in West Java have a fractal dimension between 1.5 and 1.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lukman |first1=Muhamad |last2=Hariadi |first2=Yun |last3=Destiarmand |first3=Achmad Haldani |title=Batik Fractal : Traditional Art to Modern Complexity |journal=Proceeding Generative Art X, Milan, Italy |date=2007 |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/36748400/32.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1474897246&amp;Signature=kXmu3pdTrpZ1pkw8CLV3GHNR%2FVs%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DBatik_Fractal_Traditional_Art_to_Modern.pdf |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[drip painting]] works of the modern artist [[Jackson Pollock]] are similarly distinctive in their fractal dimension. His 1948 ''Number 14'' has a coastline-like dimension of 1.45, while his later paintings had successively higher fractal dimensions and accordingly more elaborate patterns. One of his last works, ''Blue Poles'', took six months to create, and has the fractal dimension of 1.72.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ouellette |first1=Jennifer |title=Pollock's Fractals |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2001/nov/featpollock |accessdate=26 September 2016 |agency=Discover Magazine |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A complex relationship==
The astronomer [[Galileo Galilei]] in his ''[[Il Saggiatore]]'' wrote that "[The universe] is written in [[patterns in nature|the language of mathematics]], and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Galilei, Galileo |authorlink=Galileo Galilei |title=The Assayer |year=1623}}, as translated in {{cite book |author=Drake, Stillman |authorlink=Stillman Drake  |year=1957 |title=Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo |publisher=Doubleday |pages=237–238 |isbn=0-385-09239-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who strive and seek to study nature must first, in Galileo's view, fully understand mathematics. Mathematicians, conversely, have sought to interpret and analyse art through the lens of geometry and rationality. The mathematician Felipe Cucker suggests that mathematics, and especially geometry, is a source of rules for "rule-driven artistic creation", though not the only one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the many strands of the resulting complex relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; are described below.

[[File:Ghhardy@72.jpg|thumb|upright|The mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] defined a set of criteria for [[mathematical beauty]].]]

===Mathematics as an art===
{{main article|Mathematical beauty}}

The mathematician Jerry P. King describes mathematics as an art, stating that "the keys to mathematics are beauty and elegance and not dullness and technicality", and that beauty is the motivating force for mathematical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; King cites the mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]]'s 1940 essay ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]''. In it, Hardy discusses why he finds two theorems of [[classical antiquity|classical times]] as first rate, namely [[Euclid]]'s proof there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and the proof that the square root of 2 is [[irrational number|irrational]]. King evaluates this last against Hardy's criteria for [[mathematical beauty|mathematical elegance]]: "''seriousness, depth, generality, unexpectedness, inevitability'', and ''economy''" (King's italics), and describes the proof as "aesthetically pleasing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=135–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] agreed that mathematics possessed beauty but considered the reasons beyond explanation: "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] beautiful. If you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I ''know'' numbers are beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Devlin |first=Keith |title=The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved And Why Numbers Are Like Gossip |publisher=Basic Books |year=2000 |page=140 |chapter=Do Mathematicians Have Different Brains? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJdmfYEaLG4C |isbn=978-0-465-01619-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[Richard Wright]] argues that mathematical objects that can be constructed can be seen either "as processes to simulate phenomena" or as works of "[[computer art]]". He considers the nature of mathematical thought, observing that [[fractals]] were known to mathematicians for a century before they were recognised as such. Wright concludes by stating that it is appropriate to subject mathematical objects to any methods used to "come to terms with cultural artifacts like art, the tension between objectivity and subjectivity, their metaphorical meanings and the character of representational systems." He gives as instances an image from the [[Mandelbrot set]], an image generated by a [[cellular automaton]] algorithm, and a [[rendering (computer graphics)|computer-rendered]] image, and discusses, with reference to the [[Turing test]], whether [[algorithm]]ic products can be art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Richard |title=Some Issues in the Development of Computer Art as a Mathematical Art Form |journal=[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]] |date=1988 |volume=1 |issue=Electronic Art, supplemental issue |pages=103–110 |doi=10.2307/1557919 |jstor=1557919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sasho Kalajdzievski's ''Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics'' takes a similar approach, looking at suitably visual mathematics topics such as tilings, fractals and hyperbolic geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kalajdzievski |first1=Sasho |title=Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics |date=2008 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |isbn=978-1-58488-913-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematician and [[theoretical physicist]] [[Henri Poincaré]]'s ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'' was widely read by the [[Cubism|Cubists]], including [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Jean Metzinger]].&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Arthur I. |title=Insights of Genius: Imagery and Creativity in Science and Art |publisher=Springer |year=2012 |isbn=1-4612-2388-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré viewed [[Euclidean geometry]] as just one of many possible geometric configurations, rather than as an absolute objective truth. The possible existence of a [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]] inspired artists to question classical [[Perspective (graphical)#Renaissance&amp;nbsp;: Mathematical basis|Renaissance perspective]]: [[non-Euclidean geometry]] became a valid alternative.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;{{cite book |author=Henderson, Linda D. |title=The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean geometry in Modern Art |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://eres.lndproxy.org/edoc/AH317Antliff-09.pdf |author1=Antliff, Mark |author2=Leighten, Patricia Dee |title=Cubism and Culture |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |year=2001 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everdell |first=William R. |authorlink=William Everdell |title=The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought |year=1997 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-22480-5 |page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept that painting could be expressed mathematically, in colour and form, contributed to Cubism, the art movement that led to [[abstract art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Green, Christopher |title=Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916–1928 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1987 |pages=13–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metzinger, in 1910, wrote that: "[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician [[Maurice Princet]] has deduced a whole geometry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |date=October–November 1910 |title=Note sur la peinture |journal=Pan |page=60}} in {{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |publisher=Basic Books |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Metzinger wrote in his memoirs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Maurice Princet joined us often&amp;nbsp;... it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked ''n''-dimensional continuums. He loved to get the artists interested in the [[Schlegel diagram|new views on space]] that had been opened up by [[Victor Schlegel|Schlegel]] and some others. He succeeded at that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |title=Le cubisme était né |year=1972 |publisher=Éditions Présence |pages=43–44}} in {{cite book |last=Ferry |first=Luc |authorlink=Luc Ferry |others=Robert De Loaiza, trans. |title=Homo Aestheticus: The Invention of Taste in the Democratic Age |year=1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-24459-8 |page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The impulse to make teaching or research models of mathematical forms naturally creates objects that have symmetries and surprising or pleasing shapes. Some of these have inspired artists such as the [[Dadaism|Dadaists]] [[Man Ray]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Man Ray–Human Equations A Journey from Mathematics to Shakespeare.

[[File:Objet mathematique by Man Ray.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Enneper surface]]s as [[Dadaism]]: [[Man Ray]]'s 1934 ''Objet mathematique'']]
Man Ray photographed some of the mathematical models in the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]] in Paris, including ''Objet mathematique'' (Mathematical object). He noted that this represented [[Enneper surface]]s with constant [[negative curvature]], derived from the [[pseudo-sphere]]. This mathematical foundation was important to him, as it allowed him to deny that the object was "abstract", instead claiming that it was as real as the urinal that Duchamp made into a work of art. Man Ray admitted that the object's [Enneper surface] formula "meant nothing to me, but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature." He used his photographs of the mathematical models as figures in his series he did on [[Shakespeare]]'s plays, such as his 1934 painting ''Antony and Cleopatra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tubbs |first1=Robert |title=Mathematics in 20th-Century Literature and Art |date=2014 |publisher=Johns Hopkins |isbn=978-1-4214-1380-8 |pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art reporter Jonathan Keats, writing in ''ForbesLife'', argues that Man Ray photographed "the elliptic paraboloids and conic points in the same sensual light as his pictures of [[Kiki de Montparnasse]]", and "ingeniously repurposes the cool calculations of mathematics to reveal the topology of desire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Keats |first1=Jonathon |title=See How Man Ray Made Elliptic Paraboloids Erotic At This Phillips Collection Photography Exhibit |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathonkeats/2015/02/13/see-how-man-ray-made-elliptic-paraboloids-sexy-at-this-phillips-collection-photography-exhibit/ |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=10 September 2015 |date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twentieth century sculptors such as [[Henry Moore]], [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Naum Gabo]] took inspiration from mathematical models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=311–312 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore wrote of his 1938 ''Stringed Mother and Child'': "Undoubtedly the source of my stringed figures was the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]]&amp;nbsp;...

[[File:Theo van Doesburg 122.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Theo van Doesburg]]'s ''Six Moments in the Development of Plane to Space'', 1926 or 1929]]

The artists [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] founded the [[De Stijl]] movement, which they wanted to "establish a visual vocabulary {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} elementary geometrical forms comprehensible by all and adaptable to any discipline".&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/d/de-stijl |title=De Stijl |accessdate=11 September 2015 |work=Tate Glossary |publisher=The Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curl |first=James Stevens |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=2006 |edition=Second |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of their artworks visibly consist of ruled squares and triangles, sometimes also with circles. De Stijl artists worked in painting, furniture, interior design and architecture.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; After the breakup of De Stijl, Van Doesburg founded the [[Avant-garde]] [[Art Concret]] movement, describing his 1929–1930 ''[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Theo_van_Doesburg_218.jpg Arithmetic Composition]'', a series of four black squares on the diagonal of a squared background, as "a structure that can be controlled, a ''definite'' surface without chance elements or individual caprice", yet "not lacking in spirit, not lacking the universal and not&amp;nbsp;... empty as there is ''everything'' which fits the internal rhythm". The art critic Gladys Fabre observes that two progressions are at work in the painting, namely the growing black squares and the alternating backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tubbs, Robert |title=Mathematics in Twentieth-Century Literature and Art: Content, Form, Meaning  |year=2014 |publisher=JHU Press |pages=44–47 |isbn=978-1-4214-1402-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics of [[tessellation]], polyhedra, shaping of space, and self-reference provided the graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] (1898—1972) with a lifetime's worth of materials for his woodcuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/ggescher/ggescher-main1.html |title=Tour: M.C.

Escher used irregular polygons when tiling the plane and often used reflections, [[glide reflection]]s, and [[Translation (geometry)|translations]] to obtain further patterns. Many of his works contain impossible constructions, made using geometrical objects which set up a contradiction between perspective projection and three dimensions, but are pleasant to the human sight. Escher's ''[[Ascending and Descending]]'' is based on the "[[Penrose stairs|impossible staircase]]" created by the medical scientist [[Lionel Penrose]] and his son the mathematician [[Roger Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penrose |first1=L.S. |last2=Penrose |first2=R. |title=Impossible objects: A special type of visual illusion |journal=[[British Journal of Psychology]] |year=1958 |volume=49 |pages=31–33 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1958.tb00634.x |pmid=13536303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kirousis |first1=Lefteris M. |last2=Papadimitriou |first2=Christos H. |author2-link=Christos Papadimitriou |title=The complexity of recognizing polyhedral scenes |doi=10.1109/sfcs.1985.59 |pages=175–185 |work=[[Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|26th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science]] (FOCS 1985) |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=Martin |contribution=Tractability of Drawing Interpretation |doi=10.1007/978-1-84800-229-6_9 |isbn=978-1-84800-229-6 |pages=217–230 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |title=Line Drawing Interpretation |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Escher's many tessellation drawings were inspired by conversations with the mathematician [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] on [[hyperbolic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roberts, Siobhan |authorlink=Siobhan Roberts|work=King of Infinite Space: Donald Coxeter, the Man Who Saved Geometry |page=Chapter 11 |title='Coxetering' with M.C. Escher |publisher=Walker |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escher was especially interested in five specific polyhedra, which appear many times in his work. The [[Platonic solids]]—tetrahedrons, cubes, octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons—are especially prominent in ''Order and Chaos'' and ''Four Regular Solids''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Escher, M.C. |title=The World of MC Escher |publisher=Random House |date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stellated figures often reside within another figure which further distorts the viewing angle and conformation of the polyhedrons and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Escher, M.C. |author2=Vermeulen, M.W. |author3=Ford, K. |title=Escher on Escher: Exploring the Infinite |year=1989 |publisher=HN Abrams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual intricacy of mathematical structures such as tessellations and polyhedra have inspired a variety of mathematical artworks. [[Stewart Coffin]] makes polyhedral puzzles in rare and beautiful woods; [[George W. Hart]] works on the theory of [[polyhedra]] and sculpts objects inspired by them; [[Magnus Wenninger]] makes "especially beautiful" models of [[List of Wenninger polyhedron models|complex stellated polyhedra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Malkevitch |first1=Joseph |title=Mathematics and Art. 5.

The distorted perspectives of [[anamorphosis]] have been explored in art since the sixteenth century, when [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] incorporated a severely distorted skull in his 1533 painting ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]''. Many artists since then, including Escher, have make use of anamorphic tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marcolli, Matilde |authorlink=Matilde Marcolli |title=The notion of Space in Mathematics through the lens of Modern Art |publisher=Century Books |date=July 2016 |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/SpaceMathArticle.pdf |pages=23–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics of [[topology]] has inspired several artists in modern times. The sculptor [[John Robinson (sculptor)|John Robinson]] (1935–2007) created works such as ''Gordian Knot'' and ''Bands of Friendship'', displaying [[knot theory]] in polished bronze.&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt; Other works by Robinson explore the topology of [[torus]]es.

Modelling is far from the only possible way to illustrate mathematical concepts. Giotto's ''[[Stefaneschi Triptych]]'', 1320, illustrates [[recursion]] in the form of ''[[mise en abyme]]''; the central panel of the triptych contains, lower left, the kneeling figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the triptych as an offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Giotto di Bondone and assistants: Stefaneschi triptych |url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/PIN/PIN_Sala02_03.html |publisher=The Vatican |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giorgio Chirico]]'s [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] paintings such as his 1917 ''Great Metaphysical Interior'' explore the question of levels of representation in art by depicting paintings within his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=337–338 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art can exemplify logical paradoxes, as in some paintings by the [[surrealist]] [[René Magritte]], which can be read as [[semiotic]] jokes about confusion between levels. In ''[[The Human Condition (painting)|La condition humaine]]'' (1933), Magritte depicts an easel (on the real canvas), seamlessly supporting a view through a window which is framed by "real" curtains in the painting. Similarly, Escher's ''[[Print Gallery (M. C. Escher)|Print Gallery]]'' (1956) is a print which depicts a distorted city which contains a gallery which [[recursive]]ly contains the picture, and so ''[[ad infinitum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cooper |first1=Jonathan |title=Art and Mathematics |url=http://www.doctordada.com/art/art-and-mathematics/ |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magritte made use of spheres and cuboids to distort reality in a different way, painting them alongside an assortment of houses in his 1931 ''Mental Arithmetic'' as if they were children's building blocks, but house-sized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Douglas R. |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |titlelink=Gödel, Escher, Bach |date=1980 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-028920-6 |page=627}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' observed that the "eerie toytown image" prophesied [[Modernism]]'s usurpation of "cosy traditional forms", but also plays with the human tendency to seek [[patterns in nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hall |first1=James |title=René Magritte: The Pleasure Principle – exhibition |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/10/rene-magritte-pleasure-principle-exhibition |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salvador Dalí's last painting, ''[[The Swallow's Tail]]'' (1983), was part of a series inspired by [[René Thom]]'s [[catastrophe theory]].&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Elliott |editor1-last=Ades |editor1-first=Dawn |title=Dali |date=2004 |publisher=Bompiani Arte |location=Milan |pages=418–421}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish painter and sculptor [[Pablo Palazuelo]] (1916–2007) focused on the investigation of form. He developed a style that he described as the geometry of life and the geometry of all nature. Consisting of simple geometric shapes with detailed patterning and coloring, in works such as ''Angular I'' and ''Automnes'', Palazuelo expressed himself in geometric transformations.&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt;

Artists, however, do not necessarily take geometry literally. As [[Douglas Hofstadter]] writes in his 1980 reflection on human thought, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', by way of (among other things) the mathematics of art: "The difference between an Escher drawing and [[non-Euclidean geometry]] is that in the latter, comprehensible interpretations can be found for the undefined terms, resulting in a comprehensible total system, whereas for the former, the end result is not reconcilable with one's conception of the world, no matter how long one stares at the pictures." Hofstadter discusses the seemingly [[paradox]]ical lithograph ''Print Gallery'' by M. C. Escher; it depicts a seaside town containing an art gallery which seems to contain a painting of the seaside town, there being a "strange loop, or tangled hierarchy" to the levels of reality in the image. The artist himself, Hofstadter observes, is not seen; his reality and his relation to the lithograph are not paradoxical.&lt;ref name=GEB&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Douglas R. |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |titlelink=Gödel, Escher, Bach |date=1980 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-394-74502-2 |pages=98–99, 690–717}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image's central void has also attracted the interest of mathematicians Bart de Smit and [[Hendrik Lenstra]], who propose that it could contain a [[Droste effect]] copy of itself, rotated and shrunk; this would be a further illustration of recursion beyond that noted by Hofstadter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=de Smit |first=B. |title=The Mathematical Structure of Escher's Print Gallery |year=2003 |journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=446–451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LenstraWebsite&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lenstra |first1=Hendrik |last2=De Smit |first2=Bart |title=Applying mathematics to Escher's Print Gallery |url=http://escherdroste.math.leidenuniv.nl/index.php?menu=intro |publisher=Leiden University |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis of art history===

Algorithmic analysis of images of artworks, for example using [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], can reveal information about art. Such techniques can uncover images in layers of paint later covered over by an artist; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded; help to tell a copy from an original, or distinguish the brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stanek |first1=Becca |title=Van Gogh and the Algorithm: How Math Can Save Art |url=http://time.com/2884058/math-art-van-gogh-duke/ |publisher=Time Magazine |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sipics |first1=Michelle |title=The Van Gogh Project: Art Meets Mathematics in Ongoing International Study |url=https://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=1568 |publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is highly unlikely, therefore, that Pollock consciously understood the fractals he was painting. Nevertheless, his introduction of fractals was deliberate. For example, the colour of the anchor layer was chosen to produce the sharpest contrast against the canvas background and this layer also occupies more canvas space than the other layers, suggesting that Pollock wanted this highly fractal anchor layer to visually dominate the painting. Furthermore, after the paintings were completed, he would dock the canvas to remove regions near the canvas edge where the pattern density was less uniform. |doi=10.1088/2058-7058/12/10/21 |volume=12 |pages=25–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Max Ernst painted [[Lissajous figures]] directly by swinging a punctured bucket of paint over a canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/12307/WPIAAD_vol2_king.pdf |title=From Max Ernst to Ernst Mach: epistemology in art and science. |last=King |first=M. |date=2002 |accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computer scientist [[Neil Dodgson]] investigated whether [[Bridget Riley]]'s stripe paintings could be characterised mathematically, concluding that while separation distance could "provide some characterisation" and global [[entropy]] worked on some paintings, [[autocorrelation]] failed as Riley's patterns were irregular. Local entropy worked best, and correlated well with the description given by the art critic Robert Kudielka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dodgson |first1=N. A. |title=Mathematical characterisation of Bridget Riley's stripe paintings |journal=[[Journal of Mathematics and the Arts]] |date=2012 |volume=5 |pages=1–21 |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nad10/pubs/jma12.pdf |quote=over the course [of] the early 1980s, Riley's patterns moved from more regular to more random (as characterised by global entropy), without losing their rhythmic structure (as characterised by local entropy). This reflects Kudielka's description of her artistic development. |doi=10.1080/17513472.2012.679468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American mathematician [[George Birkhoff]]'s 1933 ''Aesthetic Measure'' proposes a quantitative metric of the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic quality]] of an artwork. It does not attempt to measure the connotations of a work, such as what a painting might mean, but is limited to the "elements of order" of a polygonal figure. Birkhoff first combines (as a sum) five such elements: whether there is a vertical axis of symmetry; whether there is optical equilibrium; how many rotational symmetries it has; how wallpaper-like the figure is; and whether there are unsatisfactory features such as having two vertices too close together. This metric, ''O'', takes a value between −3 and 7. The second metric, ''C'', counts elements of the figure, which for a polygon is the number of different straight lines containing at least one of its sides. Birkhoff then defines his aesthetic measure of an object's beauty as ''O/C''. This can be interpreted as a balance between the pleasure looking at the object gives, and the amount of effort needed to take it in. Birkhoff's proposal has been criticized in various ways, not least for trying to put beauty in a formula, but he never claimed to have done that.&lt;ref name=Cucker116&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=116–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stimuli to mathematical research===

[[File:Fraser spiral.svg|thumb|upright|The [[Fraser spiral illusion]], named for Sir James Fraser who discovered it in 1908.]]

[[Optical illusion]]s such as the [[Fraser spiral illusion|Fraser spiral]] strikingly demonstrate limitations in human visual perception, creating what the [[art historian]] [[Ernst Gombrich]] called a "baffling trick." The black and white ropes that appear to form [[spiral]]s are in fact [[concentric circle]]s. The mid-twentieth century [[Op art|Op art or optical art]] style of painting and graphics exploited such effects to create the impression of movement and flashing or vibrating patterns seen in the work of artists such as [[Bridget Riley]]&lt;!--slight overlink seems sensible here--&gt;, Spyros Horemis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=163–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Vasarely]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=406–410 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacred geometry===
{{further information|Sacred geometry|Mathematics and music}}

A strand of art from Ancient Greece onwards sees God as the geometer of the world, and the world's geometry therefore as sacred. The belief that God created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. [[Plutarch]] attributed the belief to [[Plato]], writing that "Plato said God geometrizes continually" (''Convivialium disputationum'', liber 8,2). This image has influenced Western thought ever since. The Platonic concept derived in its turn from a [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] notion of harmony in music, where the notes were spaced in perfect proportions, corresponding to the lengths of the lyre's strings; indeed, the Pythagoreans held that everything was arranged by Number. In the same way, in Platonic thought, the [[Platonic solid|regular or Platonic solids]] dictate the proportions found in nature, and in art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ghyka |first1=Matila |title=The Geometry of Art and Life |date=2003 |publisher=Dover |isbn=978-0-486-23542-4 |pages=ix–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lawlor |first1=Robert |title=Sacred Geometry: Philosophy and Practice |date=1982 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-81030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Mediaeval manuscript illustration may refer to a verse in the Old Testament: "When he established the heavens I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the deep" (Proverbs 8:27), showing God drawing out the universe with a pair of compasses.&lt;ref name=Calter&gt;{{cite web |last1=Calter |first1=Paul |title=Celestial Themes in Art &amp; Architecture |url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit10/unit10.html |publisher=Dartmouth College |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1596, the mathematical astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] modelled the universe as a set of nested Platonic solids, determining the relative sizes of the orbits of the planets.&lt;ref name=Calter/&gt; [[William Blake]]'s ''Ancient of Days'' and his painting of the physicist [[Isaac Newton]], naked and drawing with a compass, attempt to depict the contrast between the mathematically perfect spiritual world and the imperfect physical world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Thought of a Thought – Edgar Allan Poe |url=http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath522/kmath522.htm |publisher=MathPages |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in a different way does [[Salvador Dalí]]'s 1954 ''[[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)]]'', which depicts the cross as a [[hypercube]], representing the divine perspective with four dimensions rather than the usual three.&lt;ref name=CorpusHypercubus /&gt; In Dali's ''[[The Sacrament of the Last Supper]]'' (1955) Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant [[dodecahedron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Livio |first1=Mario |authorlink=Mario Livio |title=The golden ratio and aesthetics |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/golden-ratio-and-aesthetics |accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Friedländer''' (April 29, 1833 – December 10, 1910) was an [[oriental studies|Orientalist]] and principal of [[Jews' College]], [[London]].  He is best known for his [[English language|English]] translation of [[Maimonides]]' ''[[Guide to the Perplexed]]'', which was the most popular such translation until the more recent work of [[Shlomo Pines]], and still remains in print.

==Biography==
Friedländer was born at [[Jutrosin|Jutroschin]], in the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]].  His early secular education was at a local [[Catholic school]], and his Jewish education came from attendance of a [[Cheder]], and from his father, who was a [[talmudist]] and [[Hebrew grammarian]].  He then attended the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], while continuing his Jewish studies under Rabbi [[Jacob Joseph Oettinger]] and Rabbi [[Elchanan Rosenstein]].

In 1856, he began studies in classical languages and mathematics at the universities of [[University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Halle/Saale]] (Ph.D. 1862), and concurrently with his university studies he pursued [[Talmudic]] learning. Settling in Berlin, he was appointed principal of the Talmud school, which position he resigned in 1865 to accept that of principal of Jews' College, London, in succession to [[Barnett Abrahams]].  There he taught theology, biblical and rabbinical exegesis, Talmud, Jewish history, mathematics, and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

He retired from this position in 1907, and died on December 10, 1910.  His son-in-law was [[Moses Gaster]] (1856–1939), the [[Hakham]] of the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish and Portuguese congregation]], [[London]], and a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Linguistics|linguist]].

Friedländer displayed considerable literary activity. He authored a few dozen articles for the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]. As a member of the [[Society of Hebrew Literature]] he published under its auspices:
*''The Commentary of [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] on [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]]'', translated into English with extensive annotations (available on Google Books)
*''An [[Essay]] on the Writings of Ibn Ezra''
*A translation from the original [[Arabic language|Arabic]], with notes, of [[Maimonides]]' ''[[Guide of the Perplexed]]'' (1881).
*''The Jewish Religion'' (1890, American edition: 1946)
*[[German language|German]] commentary upon the [[Song of Songs]] (1867).

He also edited a ''Jewish Family Bible'' in English and Hebrew, compiled a ''Handbook of the Jewish Religion,'' made calculations on the [[Hebrew calendar]], and contributed articles to the ''[[Jewish Quarterly Review]],'' the ''Dictionary of National Biography,'' and other publications. Numerous papers read by him at Jews' College and elsewhere have been published.

'''Music engraving''' is the [[art]] of drawing [[music notation]] at high quality for the purpose of mechanical reproduction. The term ''music copying'' is almost equivalent—though ''music engraving'' implies a higher degree of skill and quality, usually for publication. The name of the process originates in plate engraving, a widely used technique dating from the late sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Four Hundred Years of Music Printing|last = King|first = A. Hyatt|publisher = Trustees of the British Museum|year = 1968|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''engraving'' is now used to refer to any high-quality method of drawing [[music notation]], particularly on a [[computer]] ("computer engraving" or "computer setting") or by hand ("hand engraving").

== Traditional engraving techniques ==

=== Elements of music engraving style ===
Mechanical music engraving began in the middle of the fifteenth century. As [[musical composition]] increased in complexity, so too did the technology required to produce accurate [[Sheet music|musical score]]s. Unlike literary printing, which mainly contains printed words, music engraving communicates several different types of information simultaneously. To be clear to musicians, it is imperative that engraving techniques allow absolute precision. Notes of [[Chord (music)|chords]], [[Dynamics (music)|dynamic markings]], and other notation line up with vertical accuracy. If text is included, each syllable matches vertically with its assigned melody. Horizontally, subdivisions of beats are marked not only by their flags and [[Beam (music)|beams]], but also by the relative space between them on the page.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The logistics of creating such precise copies posed several problems for early music engravers, and have resulted in the development of several music engraving technologies.

=== Moveable type ===
Similar to book printing, music printing began in the fifteenth century with the use of [[moveable type]]. The central problem posed to early music engravers using moveable type was the proper integration of notes, staves, and text. Often, staff lines were hand drawn prior to printing, or added to the printed music afterward. [[Ottavio Petrucci]], one of the most innovative music printers working at the turn of the sixteenth century, used a triple impression technique that printed staves, text, and notes in three separate steps.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Plate engraving ===
Although [[Engraving|plate engraving]] had been used since the early fifteenth century for creating visual art and maps, it was not applied to music until 1581.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this method, a mirror image of a complete page of music was engraved onto a metal plate. Ink was then applied to the grooves, and the music print was transferred onto paper. Metal plates could be stored and reused, which made this method an attractive option for music engravers. [[Copper]] was the initial metal of choice for early plates, but by the eighteenth century [[pewter]] became the standard material due to its malleability and lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Early American Music Engraving and Printing|last = Wolfe|first = Richard J.|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = Urbana, IL|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, plates were engraved freely by hand. Eventually, music engravers developed a number of tools to aid in their process, including:
* Scorers for staves and [[Bar (music)|bar lines]], the use of which inspired the term [[Sheet music|musical score]]
* Elliptical gravers for [[Dynamics (music)|crescendos and diminuendos]]
* Flat gravers for [[Tie (music)|ties]] and [[ledger lines]]
* [[Punch (tool)|Punches]] for [[note head]]s, [[clefs]], [[Accidental (music)|accidentals]], and letters&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Music Publishing in the Canadas, 1800-1867|last = Calderisi|first = Maria|publisher = National Library of Canada|year = 1981|isbn = |location = Ottawa|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate engraving was the methodology of choice for music printing until the late nineteenth century, at which point its decline was hastened by the development of photographic technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nevertheless, the technique has survived to the present day, and is still occasionally used by select publishers such as [[G. Henle Verlag]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.henle.com/en/the-publishing-house/music-engraving/index.html|title = Music Engraving|date = |accessdate = November 3, 2014|website = G. Henle Publishers|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hand copying ===
Historically, a musician was required to draw his own [[staff (music)|staff]] lines (staves) onto blank paper. Eventually, staff paper was manufactured pre-printed with staves as a labor-saving technique. The musician could then write music directly onto the lines in pencil or ink.

In the twentieth century, music staff paper was sometimes printed on [[vellum]] or [[onionskin]]—a durable, semi-transparent material that made it easier for the musician to correct mistakes and revise the work, and also made it possible to reproduce the manuscript through the [[ozalid|ozalid process]]. Also at this time, a [[music copyist]] was often employed to hand-copy individual parts (for each performer) from a composer's full score. Neatness, speed, and accuracy were desirable traits of a skilled copyist.

=== Other techniques ===
* '''[[Lithography]]''': Similar to metal plate engraving, the music was etched onto limestone and then burned onto the surface with acid to preserve the stone plates for future use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.musicprintinghistory.org/lithography/about-lithography.html|title = About Lithography|date = |accessdate = November 3, 2014|website = Music Printing History|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Stencils''', '''stamps''', and '''dry transfers''', including the Notaset, a system inspired by the [[Letraset]] used in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.musicprintinghistory.org/stencils/transfers.html|title = Transfers|date = |accessdate = November 3, 2014|website = Music Printing History|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brushing ink through stencils was a high-quality technique used by [[Amersham]]-based company Halstan &amp; Co.
* '''Music [[typewriters]]''': Originally developed in the late nineteenth century, this technology did not become popular until the mid-1900s. The machines required the use of pre-printed [[manuscript paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.musicprintinghistory.org/music-typewriters|title = Music Typewriters|date = |accessdate = October 22, 2017|website = Music Printing History|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique produced low-quality results and was never widely used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QCgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=popular+science+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AnvcTt6DBMePgwfR96XpDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCThu#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Machine Types Simplified Music."] ''Popular Science'', August 1948, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer music engraving ==
{{Main article|Scorewriter}}

With the advent of the [[personal computer]] since the 1980s, traditional music engraving has been in decline, as it can now be accomplished by computer [[software]] designed for this purpose. There are various such programs, known as [[scorewriter]]s, designed for writing, editing, printing and playing back music, though only a few produce results of a quality comparable to high-quality traditional engraving. Scorewriters have many advanced features, such as the ability to extract individual parts from an orchestral/band score, to transcribe music played on a [[MIDI]] keyboard, and conversely to play back notation via MIDI.

Beginning in the 1980s, [[WYSIWYG]] software such as [[Sibelius Software|Sibelius]], [[MuseScore]], and [[Finale (software)|Finale]] first let musicians enter complex music notation on a computer screen, displaying it just as it will look when eventually printed. Such software stores the music in files of proprietary or standardized formats, usually not directly readable by humans.

Other software, such as GNU [[LilyPond]] and [[Philip's Music Writer]], reads input from ordinary text files whose contents resemble a computer [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] programming language that describes bare musical content with little or no layout specification. The software translates the usually handwritten description into fully engraved graphical pages to view or send for printing, taking care of appearance decisions from high level layout down to glyph drawing. The music entry process is iterative and is similar to the edit-compile-execute cycle used to debug computer programs.

Beside ready-made [[Application software|applications]] there are also some [[Library (computing)|programming libraries]] for music engraving, such as [http://www.vexflow.com/ Vexflow] ([[JavaScript|Javascript]] library), [http://www.verovio.org/ Verovio] (C++, [[JavaScript|Javascript]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]]), [http://guidolib.sourceforge.net/ Guido Engine] ([[C++]] library), and [http://manufaktura-controls.com/ Manufaktura Controls] ([[.NET Framework|.NET]] libraries).  The main purpose of these libraries is to reduce time required for development of software with score rendering capabilities.

'''Neurogenetics''' studies the role of [[genetics]] in the development and function of the [[nervous system]]. It considers neural characteristics as [[phenotype]]s (i.e. manifestations, measurable or not, of the genetic make-up of an individual), and is mainly based on the observation that the nervous systems of individuals, even of those belonging to the same [[species]], may not be identical. As the name implies, it draws aspects from both the studies of [[neuroscience]] and genetics, focusing in particular how the genetic code an organism carries affects its expressed [[Phenotypic trait|traits]]. [[Mutation]]s in this genetic sequence can have a wide range of effects on the quality of life of the individual. Neurological diseases, behavior and personality are all studied in the context of neurogenetics. The field of neurogenetics emerged in the mid to late 1900s with advances closely following advancements made in available technology. Currently, neurogenetics is the center of much research utilizing cutting edge techniques.

==History==
The field of neurogenetics emerged from advances made in molecular biology, genetics and a desire to understand the link between genes, behavior, the brain, and neurological disorders and diseases. The field started to expand in the 1960s through the research of [[Seymour Benzer]], considered by some to be the father of neurogenetics.&lt;ref name="Olypmians"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.caltech.edu/talk-archive/index.html|title=Olympians of Science: A Display of Medals and Awards |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=5 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Seymour Benzer.gif|thumb|Seymour Benzer in his office at Caltech in 1974 with a big model of Drosophila]] His pioneering work with ''[[Drosophila]]'' helped to elucidate the link between circadian rhythms and genes, which led to further investigations into other behavior traits. He also started conducting research in neurodegeneration in fruit flies in an attempt to discover ways to suppress neurological diseases in humans. Many of the techniques he used and conclusions he drew would drive the field forward.&lt;ref name="CalTech"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.caltech.edu/press_releases/13076 |title=Neurogenetics Pioneer Seymour Benzer Dies |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=5 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120073420/http://media.caltech.edu/press_releases/13076 |archivedate=20 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Early analysis relied on statistical interpretation through processes such as [[genetic linkage|LOD]] (logarithm of odds) scores of [[pedigree chart|pedigrees]] and other observational methods such as affected sib-pairs, which looks at phenotype and [[identity by descent|IBD]] (identity by descent) configuration. Many of the disorders studied early on including [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]], [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's]] and [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) are still at the center of much research to this day.&lt;ref name=Gershon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gershon|first=Elliot S.|author2=Lynn R. Goldin|title=The outlook for linkage research in psychiatric disorders|journal=J. Psychiatr.

This process is referred to sometimes as linkage analysis.&lt;ref name=Tanzi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tanzi|first=R.E.|title=Genetic linkage studies of human neurodegenerative disorders|journal=Curr Opin Neurobiol|date=Oct 1991|volume=1|issue=3|pages=455–461|pmid=1840379|doi=10.1016/0959-4388(91)90069-J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenstein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenstein|first=P|author2=T.D.

This decade saw a marked increase in identifying the specific role genes played in relation to neurological disorders. Advancements were made in but not limited to: [[Fragile X syndrome]], Alzheimer’s, [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson’s]], [[epilepsy]] and ALS.&lt;ref name=Tandon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tandon|first=P.N.|title=The decade of the brain: a brief review|journal=Neurol India|date=Sep 2000|volume=48|issue=3|pages=199–207|pmid=11025621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurological disorders==
While the genetic basis of simple diseases and disorders has been accurately pinpointed, the genetics behind more complex, neurological disorders is still a source of ongoing research. New developments such as the [[Genome-wide association study|genome wide association studies]] (GWAS) have brought vast new resources within grasp. With this new information genetic variability within the human population and possibly linked diseases can be more readily discerned.&lt;ref name=Simone-Sanchez&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simon-Sanchez|first=J|author2=A. Singleton|title=Genome-wide association studies in neurological disorders|journal=Lancet Neurol|year=2008|volume=7|pages=1067–1072|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(08)70241-2|pmid=18940696|issue=11|pmc=2824165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurodegenerative diseases are a more common subset of neurological disorders, with examples being [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease]]. Currently no viable treatments exist that actually reverse the progression of neurodegenerative diseases; however, neurogenetics is emerging as one field that might yield a causative connection. The discovery of linkages could then lead to therapeutic drugs, which could reverse brain degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumar|first=A|author2=Cookson MR|title=Role of LRRK2 kinase dysfunction in Parkinson disease|journal=Expert Rev Mol Med|date=June 2011|volume=13|issue=20|pmid=21676337|pages=e20|doi=10.1017/S146239941100192X|pmc=4672634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gene sequencing==
One of the most noticeable results of further research into neurogenetics is a greater knowledge of gene loci that show linkage to neurological diseases. The table below represents a sampling of specific gene locations identified to play a role in selected neurological diseases based on prevalence in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=PD /&gt;&lt;ref name=AD /&gt;&lt;ref name=MS /&gt;&lt;ref name=HD /&gt;

==Methods of research==

===Statistical analysis===
[[Genetic linkage|Logarithm of odds (LOD)]] is a statistical technique used to estimate the probability of gene linkage between traits. LOD is often used in conjunction with pedigrees, maps of a family’s genetic make-up, in order to yield more accurate estimations.  A key benefit of this technique is its ability to give reliable results in both large and small sample sizes, which is a marked advantage in laboratory research.&lt;ref&gt;N E Morton (1996). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC39633/journal.pmed.8622960 Logarithm of odds (lods) for linkage on complex inheritance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helms, Ted (2000) [http://www.ag.ndsu.nodak.edu/plantsci/adv_genetics/genetics/lod/lod02.htm Logarithm of Odds in Advanced Genetics].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quantitative trait locus|Quantitative trait loci (QTL)]] mapping is another statistical method used to determine the chromosomal positions of a set of genes responsible for a given trait.  By identifying specific genetic markers for the genes of interest in a [[recombinant inbred strain]], the amount of interaction between these genes and their relation to the observed phenotype can be determined through complex statistical analysis.  
In a neurogenetics laboratory, the phenotype of a model organisms is observed by assessing the morphology of their brain through thin slices.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Williams (1998) [http://www.nervenet.org/papers/shortcourse98.html Neuroscience Meets Quantitative Genetics: Using Morphometric Data to Map Genes that Modulate CNS Architecture].&lt;/ref&gt;  QTL mapping can also be carried out in humans, though brain morphologies are examined using [[Magnetic resonance imaging|nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]] rather than brain slices. Human beings pose a greater challenge for QTL analysis because the genetic population cannot be as carefully controlled as that of an inbred recombinant population, which can result in sources of statistical error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bartley | first1 = AJ | last2 = Jones | first2 = DW | last3 = Weinberger | first3 = DR | year = 1997 | title = Genetic variability of human brain size and cortical gyral patterns | url = http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/120/2/257.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Brain | volume = 120 | issue = 2| pages = 257–269 | doi = 10.1093/brain/120.2.257 | pmid=9117373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recombinant DNA===
[[Recombinant DNA]] is an important method of research in many fields, including neurogenetics.  It is used to make alterations to an organism’s genome, usually causing it to over- or under-express a certain gene of interest, or express a mutated form of it.  The results of these experiments can provide information on that gene’s role in the organism’s body, and it importance in survival and fitness. The hosts are then screened with the aid of a toxic drug that the selectable marker is resistant to. The use of recombinant DNA is an example of a reverse genetics, where researchers create a mutant genotype and analyze the resulting phenotype.  In [[forward genetics]], an organism with a particular phenotype is identified first, and its genotype is then analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;Kuure-Kinsey, Matthew; McCooey, Beth (2006). [http://www.rpi.edu/dept/chem-eng/Biotech-Environ/Projects00/rdna/rdna.html The Basics of Recombinant DNA].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, Victor (2011). [http://wormbook.org/chapters/www_introreversegenetics/introreversegenetics.html Reverse Genetics].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal research===
[[File:Drosophila.jpg|thumb|Drosophila]][[File:Zebrafisch.jpg|thumb|Zebrafish]]
Model organisms are an important tool in many areas of research, including the field of neurogenetics.  By studying creatures with simpler nervous systems and with smaller genomes, scientists can better understand their biological processes and apply them to more complex organisms, such as humans.  Due to their low-maintenance and highly mapped genomes, mice, ''[[Drosophila]]'',&lt;ref name="Pfeiffer"&gt;Pfeiffer, Barret D, et al. (2008) [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/28/9715.full Tools for neuroanatomy and neurogenetics in ''Drosophila''].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Caenorhabditis elegans|''C. elegans'']]&lt;ref name="Rand"&gt;Rand, James B, Duerr, Janet S, Frisby, Dennis L (2000) [http://www.fasebj.org/content/14/15/2414.full.pdf Neurogenetics of vesicular transporters in ''C. elegans''].&lt;/ref&gt; are very common.  [[Zebrafish]]&lt;ref name="Burgess"&gt;Burgess, Harold A, Granato, Michael (2008) [http://bfg.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/6/474.short The neurogenetic frontier – lessons from misbehaving zebrafish].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[prairie vole]]s&lt;ref&gt;McGraw, Lisa A, Young, Larry J (2009) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166223609001982 The prairie vole: and emerging model organism for understanding the social brain].&lt;/ref&gt; have also become more common, especially in the social and behavioral scopes of neurogenetics.

In addition to examining how genetic mutations affect the actual structure of the brain, researchers in neurogenetics also examine how these mutations affect cognition and behavior. One method of examining this involves purposely engineering model organisms with mutations of certain genes of interest. These animals are then classically conditioned to perform certain types of tasks, such as pulling a lever in order to gain a reward. The speed of their learning, the retention of the learned behavior, and other factors are then compared to the results of healthy organisms to determine what kind of an effect – if any – the mutation has had on these higher processes. The results of this research can help identify genes that may be associated with conditions involving cognitive and learning deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbc.jhu.edu/research/posters.html Neurogenetics and Behavior Center. Johns Hopkins U, 2011. Web. 29 Oct. 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human research===
Many research facilities seek out volunteers with certain conditions or illnesses to participate in studies. Model organisms, while important, cannot completely model the complexity of the human body, making volunteers a key part to the progression of research. Along with gathering some basic information about medical history and the extent of their symptoms, samples are taken from the participants, including blood, [[cerebrospinal fluid]], and/or muscle tissue. These tissue samples are then genetically sequenced, and the genomes are added to current database collections. The growth of these data bases will eventually allow researchers to better understand the genetic nuances of these conditions and bring therapy treatments closer to reality. Current areas of interest in this field have a wide range, spanning anywhere from the maintenance of [[circadian rhythms]],&lt;ref&gt;Fu, Ying-Hui, and Louis Ptacek, dirs. "Research Projects."

==Behavioral neurogenetics==
&lt;!-- Behavioral neurogenetics and Behavioural neurogenetics redirect here --&gt;
{{Main|Behavioural genetics}}
Advances in [[molecular biology]] techniques and the species-wide [[Human Genome Project|genome project]] have made it possible to map out an individual's entire genome. Whether genetic or environmental factors are primarily responsible for an individual's personality has long been a topic of debate.&lt;ref name="Congdon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimura"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kimura |first1=Mitsuru |last2=Higuchi |first2=Susumu |title= Genetics of Alcohol Dependence |journal= Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=213–25 |year=2011 |type=Print |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.2011.02190.x |pmid=21507127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the advances being made in the field of neurogenetics, researchers have begun to tackle this question by beginning to map out genes and correlate them to different personality traits.&lt;ref name="Congdon"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Congdon |first1=Eliza |last2=Canli |first2=Turhan |title= A Neurogenetic Approach to Impulsivity |journal= Journal of Personality |volume=76 |issue=6 |pages= 1447–84 |year=2008 |type=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little to no evidence to suggest that the presence of a ''single'' gene indicates that an individual will express one style of behavior over another; rather, having a specific gene could make one more predisposed to displaying this type of behavior.  It is starting to become clear that most genetically influenced behaviors are due to the effects of many variants within ''many'' genes, in addition to other neurological regulating factors like neurotransmitter levels.  Due to fact that many behavioral characteristics have been conserved across species for generations, researchers are able to use animal subjects such as mice and rats, but also fruit flies, worms, and zebrafish,&lt;ref name="Pfeiffer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rand"/&gt; to try to determine specific genes that correlate to behavior and attempt to match these with human genes.&lt;ref name="Reaume"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reaume |first1=Christopher J. |last2=Sokolowski |first2=Marla B. |title=Conservation of Gene Function in Behavior |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |volume=366 |issue=1574 |pages=2100–2110 |year=2011 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2011.0028|pmc=3130371 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-species gene conservation===
While it is true that variation between species can appear to be pronounced, at their most basic they share many similar behavior traits which are necessary for survival. Such traits include mating, aggression, foraging, social behavior and sleep patterns. This conservation of behavior across species has led biologists to hypothesize that these traits could possibly have similar, if not the same, genetic causes and pathways. Studies conducted on the genomes of a plethora of organisms have revealed that many organisms have [[Homology (biology)|homologous genes]], meaning that some genetic material has been [[Conserved sequence|conserved]] between species.  If these organisms shared a common evolutionary ancestor, then this might imply that aspects of behavior can be inherited from previous generations, lending support to the genetic causes – as opposed to the environmental causes – of behavior.&lt;ref name="Kimura"/&gt; Variations in personalities and behavioral traits seen amongst individuals of the same species could be explained by differing levels of expression of these genes and their corresponding proteins.&lt;ref name="Reaume"/&gt;

===Aggression===
There is also research being conducted on how an individual's genes can cause varying levels of [[aggression]] and aggression control {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}.[[File:Mad dog.jpg|thumb|Outward displays of aggression are seen in most animals]] Throughout the animal kingdom, varying styles, types and levels of aggression can be observed leading scientists to believe that there might be a genetic contribution that has conserved this particular behavioral trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zwarts|first=Liesbeth|last2=Magwire|first2=Michael M.|last3=Carbone|first3=Mary Anna|last4=Versteven|first4=Marijke|last5=Herteleer|first5=Liesbet|last6=Anholt|first6=Robert R.

==Development==
[[File:Shh Gradient In Neural Tube.svg|thumb|Shh and BMP gradient in the neural tube]] A great deal of research has been done on the effects of genes and the formation of the brain and the central nervous system. The following wiki links may prove helpful:

*[[Neural development]]
*[[Neurogenesis]]
*[[Brain#Development|The Brain]]
*[[Neural tube]]

There are many genes and proteins that contribute to the formation and development of the central nervous system, many of which can be found in the aforementioned links. Of particular importance are those that code for [[Bone morphogenetic protein|BMPs]], BMP inhibitors and [[Sonic hedgehog|''SHH'']]. When expressed during early development, BMP's are responsible for the differentiation of epidermal cells from the ventral [[ectoderm]]. Inhibitors of BMPs, such as [[Noggin (protein)|''NOG'']] and [[Chordin|''CHRD'']], promote differentiation of ectoderm cells into prospective neural tissue on the dorsal side. If any of these genes are improperly regulated, then proper formation and differentiation will not occur. 
BMP also plays a very important role in the patterning that occurs after the formation of the [[neural tube]]. Due to the graded response the cells of the neural tube have to BMP and Shh signaling, these pathways are in competition to determine the fate of preneural cells. BMP promotes dorsal differentiation of pre-neural cells into [[sensory neurons]] and Shh promotes ventral differentiation into [[motor neurons]]. There are many other genes that help to determine neural fate and proper development include, [[Reelin|''RELN'']], [[Sox9|''SOX9'']], [[Wnt signaling pathway|''WNT'']], [[Notch signaling pathway|Notch and Delta coding genes]], [[Hox gene|''HOX'']], and various cadherin coding genes like [[CDH1 (gene)|''CDH1'']] and ''[[CDH2]]''.&lt;ref name="Alberts"&gt;{{cite book |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |last= Alberts|edition=5th  |year=2008 |publisher=Garland Science |isbn=0-8153-4105-9 |pages=1139–1480 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recent research has shown that the level of gene expression changes drastically in the brain at different periods throughout the life cycle.  For example, during prenatal development the amount of [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] in the brain (an indicator of gene expression) is exceptionally high, and drops to a significantly lower level not long after birth.  The only other point of the life cycle during which expression is this high is during the mid- to late-life period, during 50–70 years of age.  While the increased expression during the prenatal period can be explained by the rapid growth and formation of the brain tissue, the reason behind the surge of late-life expression remains a topic of ongoing research.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Sanders (2011). [http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/335629/title/Brain_gene_activity_changes_through_life Brain gene activity changes through life]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==
Neurogenetics is a field that is rapidly expanding and growing.  The current areas of research are very diverse in their focuses.  One area deals with molecular processes and the function of certain proteins, often in conjunction with cell signaling and neurotransmitter release, cell development and repair, or neuronal plasticity.  Behavioral and cognitive areas of research continue to expand in an effort to pinpoint contributing genetic factors. As a result of the expanding neurogenetics field a better understanding of specific neurological disorders and phenotypes has arisen with direct correlation to [[Mutation|genetic mutations]]. With severe disorders such as [[epilepsy]], brain malformations, or [[mental retardation]] a single [[gene]] or causative condition has been identified 60% of the time; however, the milder the intellectual handicap the lower chance a specific genetic cause has been pinpointed. [[Autism]] for example is only linked to a specific, mutated gene about 15–20% of the time while the mildest forms of mental handicaps are only being accounted for genetically less than 5% of the time. Research in neurogenetics has yielded some promising results, though, in that mutations at specific gene loci have been linked to harmful phenotypes and their resulting disorders. For instance a [[frameshift mutation]] or a [[missense mutation]] at the [[Doublecortin|''DCX'' gene]] location causes a neuronal migration defect also known as [[lissencephaly]]. Another example is the ''[[ROBO3]]'' gene where a mutation alters [[axon]] length negatively impacting neuronal connections. Horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS) accompanies a mutation here.&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=C|author2=Engle E|title=Allelic diversity in human developmental neurogenetics: insights into biology and disease|journal=Neuron|year=2010|volume=68|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2010.09.042|pmid=20955932|issue=2|pages=245–53|pmc=3010396}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are just a few examples of what current research in the field of neurogenetics has achieved.&lt;ref&gt;"This Week In the Journal."

[[Image:Centre of Radovish.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Principles of New Pedestrianism at a street in the renewed city center of [[Radovish]], [[Republic of Macedonia]]. Pedestrians are dominant, but there is also place for cars (parked on the left).]]
'''New Pedestrianism''' ('''NP''') is a more pedestrian and ecology-oriented variation of [[New Urbanism]] in urban planning theory, founded in 1999 by [[Michael E. Arth]], an American artist, urban/home/landscape designer, futurist, and author. NP addresses the problems associated with New Urbanism and is an attempt to solve various social, health, energy, economic, aesthetic, and environmental problems, with special focus on reducing the role of the automobile.&lt;ref name="digbyhall120.wordpress.com"&gt;Digby Hall, "New Urbanism vs. New Pedestrianism," Green Futures, October 9, 2013 [https://digbyhall120.wordpress.com/2013/10/09/new-urbanism-vs-new-pedestrianism/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amerika.org/darwinism/new-fascinating-ideas-new-pedestrianism/Frank Azzurro, Amerika, "New Pedestrianism"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://beltlandia.com/will-the-beltline-birth-new-pedestrianism/Burke Sisco, Beltlandia, "Will the BelLine Birth New Pedestrianism?"]&lt;/ref&gt;A neighborhood or new town utilizing NP is called a [[Pedestrian Village]]. Pedestrian Villages can range from being nearly car-free to having automobile access behind nearly every house and business, but pedestrian lanes are always in front.&lt;ref name="Arth, Michael E. 2010 pp. 120-139"&gt;Arth, Michael E. (2010). ''Democracy and the Common Wealth: Breaking the Stranglehold of the Special Interests'' Golden Apples Media, {{ISBN|978-0-912467-12-2}}. pp. 120-139, 363-386&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelearth.com/democracy/ Website about ''Democracy and the Common Wealth'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laborsofhercules"&gt;Michael E. Arth, ''The Labors of Hercules: Modern Solutions to 12 Herculean Problems.'' 2007 Online edition. [http://michaelearth.com/herc_IX.htm Labor IX: Urbanism]&lt;/ref&gt;

To a large extent New Urbanism is a revival of traditional street patterns and urban design. New Pedestrianism also respects traditional town design, but seeks to further reduce the negative impact of the automobile, the use of which has increased dramatically since WWII. By eliminating the front street and replacing it with a tree-lined pedestrian lane, emphasis is placed on low-impact alternative travel such as walking and cycling. Pedestrian lanes are usually 12 to {{convert|15|ft|m|0}} wide, with one smooth side for rolling conveyances such as bicycles, [[Segways]], and skates and the other, narrower, textured side for pedestrians and wheelchairs. Eliminating the automobile street from the front allows for intimate scale plazas, fountains, pocket parks, as well as an unspoiled connection to natural features such as lakes, streams, and forests that may border or be included in a Pedestrian Village. A vast public realm is created that is free from the sight, smell, and sound of automobiles, yet automobiles are still served on a separate network.&lt;ref name="digbyhall120.wordpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pedestrianvillages.com/ New Pedestrianism information]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Arth, "Pedestrian Villages are the Antidote to Sprawl" The DeLand-Deltona Beacon, May 29, 2003. Page 1D.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris Sullivan, "Town designer solves problem areas." Daytona Beach News-Journal, January 15, 2006, p. 10H.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
New Pedestrianism has been proposed for Kisima Kaya, a new town in [[Kenya]], for Tiger Bay Village, FL as a solution to the homeless problem, and for new towns and neighborhoods that can be built anywhere whether as rehabilitation of existing neighborhoods, infill, edge-of-town neighborhoods, or new towns.&lt;ref name="laborsofhercules" /&gt;

==The automobile==

To a large extent, NP is a reaction to the way in which the automobile has affected the environment and reshaped the cities. Arth writes: “Our quality of life is dependent on achieving a spectrum of physical and psychological needs in a clean, safe, and beautiful environment that can only be accomplished with highly integrated urban design and planning. As long as vehicles, roads, parking lots, garages, and automobile-related businesses cover a significant portion of the landscape and determine the design of nearly everything else, most American cities will continue to be dysfunctional and degraded slumscapes, choked with traffic.”&lt;ref name="laborsofhercules" /&gt;
[[File:401 Gridlock.jpg|thumb|300px|North American cities can suffer chronic [[traffic congestion]] despite the width of the highways.]]
Over six million motor vehicle related accidents result in almost three million injuries, and over 42,000 deaths each year in the United States alone. Worldwide, approximately half a million deaths occur each year from motor vehicle accidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/ National Highway &amp; Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over-reliance on the automobile, coupled with the lack of a pedestrian-friendly environment, has contributed to two-thirds of adult Americans being overweight or obese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transact.org/ Surface Transportation Policy Project]&lt;/ref&gt;  
Americans spend about $33 billion a year trying to lose weight.  Degradation of the urban and rural landscape caused by sprawl also has wide-ranging negative effects on the environment and contributes to high maintenance costs to the infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ National Center for Health Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Americans spend as much of their income on transportation as on housing, with residents of more automobile-dependent cities spending as much as three times as much of their Gross Regional Product (GRP). People in Houston, Atlanta, Dallas-Ft.Worth spend about 23% of their GRP on transportation compared to 9% in Honolulu, New York City, and Baltimore, and 7% in Toronto. These statistics are from the late 90’s before the huge runup in oil prices, and do not include some of the hidden costs of oil consumption.&lt;ref&gt;The [[International Center for Technology Assessment]], "[http://www.icta.org/doc/rpg%20execsum.pdf/ The Real Price of Gasoline, Executive Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609130714/http://www.icta.org/doc/rpg%20execsum.pdf |date=2007-06-09 }}" 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy==

New Pedestrianism, in its ideal form, reduces the need for oil and other limited energy sources by reducing consumption and utilizing renewable energy. It is anticipated, especially as the cost of photovoltaic cells drops, that individual homes would be equipped with solar panels and solar water heaters, and that solar parks would harvest energy for the whole community. Reducing energy needs and moving away from oil dependency would presumably address health, social, economic, and environmental problems.&lt;ref name="laborsofhercules" /&gt;

==Aesthetics==

New Pedestrianism replaces front streets with tree-lined pedestrian lanes that form a linear park system that directly connects all homes and businesses to each other, as well as to parks, greenbelts, plazas, courtyards, water features, schools, recreation, and other amenities. This presumably raises the value of all property because the public and private properties are no longer devalued by the appearance and danger of excessive [[automobile dependency]]. A separate, tree-lined, street grid for cars also exists, but it is always relegated to the rear, and the pedestrian/bike grid as the primary transportation network ensures that unsightly, noisome, and often noisy traffic is vastly reduced on the rear streets. In Pedestrian Villages, density increases because buildings can be built close to quiet, car-free lanes without the need for huge setbacks that are typical in suburban sprawl. This, in turn, places more emphasis on building design, peaceful and intimate public spaces, and aesthetics that is scaled for pedestrians.&lt;ref name="laborsofhercules" /&gt;

== History ==

Like New Urbanism, New Pedestrianism has its roots in compact, mixed-use neighborhoods common in the United States (and elsewhere) during and prior to the first quarter of the 20th century. New Pedestrianism borrows and then expands upon earlier experiments in urban design that focused on separating pedestrians from vehicular traffic.

[[Image:Venice Walk Street.png|right|thumb|300px|A walk street in Venice, California, built around 1905.]]

In a few beachside communities in Southern California, including [[Venice, California]], "walk streets" were constructed around 1905 in a few blocks near the beach. Houses faced pedestrian lanes that ranged between 3 and 10  feet wide.  Narrow alleys in the rear handled cars and parking. The canals in Venice, California, built during the same period, also had both sidewalks and canals in front of the houses.&lt;ref name="laborsofhercules" /&gt;

Urban planners [[Ebenezer Howard]] and [[Sir Patrick Geddes]] were an earlier influence on the design of [[Radburn, New Jersey]], built at the dawn of the automobile age in 1929. Radburn had pedestrian lanes in front and vehicular access at the rear on cul-de-sacs that protruded into large multi-use blocks. A study done in 1970 by John Lansing of the University of Michigan showed that 47% of its residents did their grocery shopping on foot, compared to 8% for a conventional subdivision nearby. He also determined that, overall, Radburn residents drove far less than in any other areas he studied. The Radburn plan has been copied in various forms in Sweden, England, Japan, New Zealand, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;John B. Lansing, Robert W. Marans and Robert B. Zehner, ''Planned Residential Environments'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1970), p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[San Antonio River Walk]], also known as "Paseo del Rio," was initiated in 1929. In this case, the San Antonio River underwent flood control measures and was turned into a peaceful canal lined on both sides with lively pedestrian promenades, plazas, sidewalk cafes, restaurants, clubs, shops, hotels, and other attractions that are completely separate from any vehicles. The promenades pass underneath the roads since Paseo del Rio is one level below the street and vehicular access to buildings is one story above the river.

Village Homes in [[Davis, California]] was founded in 1975 by Michael and Judy Corbett. The {{convert|70|acre|m2|sing=on}} subdivision has 225 homes and 20 apartments. Solar design and solar panels are utilized for heating. The homes have walkways passing through an extensive greenbelt system on one side of the houses with automobile access on the other side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagehomesdavis.org Village Homes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some streets in the New Urbanist development of [[Rosemary Beach, Florida]] also have boardwalks in front of some of the homes.

In 2005 New Pedestrianism was offered by Arth as part of the solution to the rebuilding of [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Arth "New Orleans is Opportunity for Better Urban Planning," The Dayton News-Journal, Section B, October 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Arth "[http://www.seasidefl.com/newsStory.asp?releaseId=1047/ New Orleans Offers Chance for Better Planning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928090541/http://www.seasidefl.com/newsStory.asp?releaseId=1047%2F |date=2007-09-28 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media about New Pedestrianism==
''[[Democracy and the Common Wealth]]: Breaking the Stranglehold of the Special Interests'' (2010), by Michael E. Arth, gives a comprehensive assessment of society and how New Pedestrianism fits into the overall scheme of things. There are also many illustrations and photographs, and a section called "Anatomy of a Pedestrian Village."&lt;ref name="Arth, Michael E. 2010 pp. 120-139"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelearth.com/democracy/|website=MichaelEarth.com|title=Democracy and the Common Wealth}} A website about the book.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New Urban Cowboy: Toward a New Pedestrianism]]'' (produced in 2008) is a feature-length documentary that tells the story of Arth's struggle to retrofit a crack slum into a Pedestrian Village while also explaining the philosophy of New Pedestrianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=GoldenApplesMedia.com|url=http://GoldenApplesMedia.com/  |title=New Urban Cowboy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=www.newurbancowboy.com|website=NewUrbanCowboy.com|title=New Urban Cowboy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

These are examples of New Pedestrianism-style [[pedestrian village]]s that represent the various types:&lt;ref name="laborsofhercules" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15660">An '''obligate parasite''' or '''holoparasite''' is a [[parasite|parasitic]] [[organism]] that cannot complete its life-cycle without exploiting a suitable [[host (biology)|host]]. If an obligate parasite cannot obtain a host it will fail to [[reproduction|reproduce]]. This is opposed to a [[facultative parasite]], which can act as a parasite but does not rely on its host to continue its life-cycle. Obligate parasites have [[evolution|evolved]] a variety of parasitic strategies to exploit their hosts. Holoparasites and some hemiparasites are obligate.

It is advantageous for the parasite to preserve the health of their host when this is compatible with their nutritional and reproductive requirements, except when the death of the host is necessary for transmission.&lt;ref name="Combes, C. 1997"&gt;Combes, C. (1997) Fitness of Parasites: Pathology and Selection ''International Journal for Parasitology'' '''27''' (1): 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Species==
Obligate parasitism is exhibited in a range of organisms, with examples in [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[parasitic plant|plants]], and [[animal]]s.&lt;ref name="Balashov 2011"&gt;Balashov, Yu.S. (2011) Parasitism and Ecological Parasitology. ''Entomological Review'' '''91''' (9): 1216-1223.&lt;/ref&gt; They are unable to complete their development without passing through at least one parasitic stage which is necessary to their life-cycle.

Whether one regards [[virus]]es as living organisms or not, they cannot reproduce except by means of resources within living cells, and accordingly, it is convenient and customary to regard them as obligate [[intracellular parasite]]s.

Among the [[Vespidae]] family, ''[[Vespula austriaca]]'' is an example of an obligate parasite; its common host is ''[[Vespula acadica]]''.&lt;ref name= "venom"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 25084514|title = Venoms of a Parasitic and Two Nonparasitic Species of Yellowjackets (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)|last = Schmidt|first = J.O|date = 1984|journal = Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society|volume = 57|issue = 2|pages = 316–322|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Reed|first2 = H.C|last3 = Akre|first3 = R.D}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the genus ''[[Bumblebee|Bombus]]'', ''[[Bombus bohemicus|B. bohemicus]]'' is an obligate parasite of  ''B. locurum'', ''B. cryptarum'', and ''B. terrestris.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Host-parasite interaction==

===Life-cycle===
[[Parasitic life cycle]]s involve the exploitation of at least one host. Parasites that infect a single species are said to have '''direct''' life-cycles.&lt;ref name="May, R.M. 1979"&gt;May, R.M. &amp; Anderson, R.M (1979) Population biology of infectious diseases. ''Nature'' '''280''': 455-461.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[hookworm]] species ''[[Necator americanus]]''. Parasites that infect more than one host are said to have a '''complex''' or '''indirect''' life-cycle.&lt;ref name="May, R.M. 1979"/&gt; For example, the [[Malaria]] plasmodium.

====Intermediate or final Host====
An '''[[Intermediate host|intermediate]]''' or '''secondary''' host is exploited by the parasite only for a short transition period. A '''final''' or '''primary''' host is exploited by the parasite and is the only location in which the parasite is able to reach maturity and if possible, reproduce sexually.
For example, ''[[Ribeiroia ondatrae]]'' uses [[Ramshorn snail]] as its first intermediate host, amphibians and fish as second intermediate hosts and birds as definitive hosts.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, B. A. &amp; Johnson, PTJ. (2011) Disease and extended phenotype: Parasites control host performance and survival through induced changes in body plan. ''PLoS ONE'' '''6'''(5):1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parasitic permanence===
Obligate parasites may not necessarily spend all of their time behaving as parasites. When a parasite is '''permanent''', a number of generations occur in or on the host of an infested individual. [[head louse|Head lice]] are an example of this. '''Temporary''' parasites are organisms whose parasitic mode of life is limited to a few or even one stage of development.&lt;ref name="Balashov 2011"/&gt; An example of this is the larval stage of [[harvest mite]]s, while the adult stage is non-parasitic.

===Location on host===
The parasite may live outside of the host '''[[Parasitism#types|ectoparasite]]'''; for example, a [[tick]]. Alternatively, the parasite may live within the host  '''[[Parasitism#types|endoparasite]]'''; for example, the [[Trematoda|fluke]]. 
An obligate parasite that does not live directly in or on the host, but rather acts at a distance {{ndash}} for example, a [[cuckoo]] which hatches and is raised by non-relatives {{ndash}} is known as a [[brood parasite]].

===Invasion strategies===
In order to establish infestation in a susceptible host, obligate parasites must evade defences before, during and after entry into the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 2069674| year = 1991| author1 = Hall| first1 = B. F.| title = Strategies of obligate intracellular parasites for evading host defences| journal = Immunology Today| volume = 12| issue = 3| pages = A22–7| last2 = Joiner| first2 = K. A.| doi = 10.1016/S0167-5699(05)80007-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the wide range of obligate parasite types, it is impossible to identify a general invasion strategy.   [[Intracellular parasite]]s use various strategies to invade cells and subvert cellular signalling pathways. Most bacteria and viruses undergo passive uptake, where they rely on the host cell for uptake. However, [[apicomplexa]]ns engage in active entry.&lt;ref&gt;Sibley, L. D. (2004) Parasite invasion strategies. ''Science'' '''304'''(5668): 284-253.&lt;/ref&gt; One obligate wasp parasite,'' [[Polistes atrimandibularis]]'', infiltrates their hosts' colony by modifying their chemical signature to match that of the hosts'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf43/anzf43-531.pdf|title = Polistes Wasps and Their Social Parasites: An Overview|last = Cervo|first = Rita|date = December 2006|journal = Ann. Zool. Fennici|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This tricks the host wasps into thinking the parasite is one of their own.

====Evasion of host defences====
A number of [[intracellular parasite#obligate|obligate intracellular parasites]] have evolved mechanisms for evading their hosts cellular defences, including the ability to survive in distinct [[cellular compartment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hackstadt, T. (1998) The diverse habitats of obligate intracellular parasites. ''Current Opinion in Microbiology'' '''1''': 82-87.&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the mechanisms that hosts employ in their attempt to reduce the replication and spread of pathogens is [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death). Some obligate parasites have developed ways to suppress this phenomenon, for example ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' although the mechanism is not yet fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;Laliberté, J. &amp; Carruthers, V.B. (2008) Host cell manipulation by the human pathogen ''toxoplasma gondii''. ''Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences'' '''65''': 1900-1915.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manipulation of host behaviour==
Changes in a host’s behaviour following infection with obligate parasites are extremely common.&lt;ref&gt;Poulin, R. (1995) “Adaptive” changes in the behaviour of parasitized animals: A critical review. ''International Journal for Parasitology'' ''' 5''' (12): 1371-1383.&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual behaviour observed in infected individuals is noted, and if its complexity suggests that this behaviour will benefit the transmission of the parasite, then this is said to be an example of [[adaptive behaviour|adaptive]] manipulation.&lt;ref name="Hughes, D. 2013"&gt;Hughes, D. (2013) Pathways to understanding the extended phenotype of parasites in their hosts. ''The Journal of Experimental Biology'' '''216''': 142-147.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a difficulty in demonstrating changes in behaviour are the result of a selective process favouring transmission of the parasite.&lt;ref&gt;Combes, C. (1991) Ethological aspects of parasite transmission. ''The American Naturalist'' '''138''' (4): 866-880.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that these changes may merely be a side-effect of infection.&lt;ref&gt;McNair D. M. &amp; Timmons E. H. 1977. Effects of ''Aspiculuris tetraptera'' and ''Syphacia obvelata'' on exploratory behaviour of an inbred mouse strain. ''Laboratory Animal Science'' '''27''':38-42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most behaviour changes have not been demonstrated to lead to [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] gains in either the host or the parasite.&lt;ref&gt;Pullin, R. (1995) “Adaptive” changes in the behaviour of parasitized animals: A critical review. ''International Journal for Parasitology'' '''25''' (12): 1371-1383.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this behaviour is the attraction of rats to cat urine after infection with ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Berdoy, M.F., Webster, J. P &amp; MacDonald, D. W.  (2000) Fatal Attraction in rats infected with ''Toxoplasma gondii''. ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'' '''267''':1591-1594.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extended phenotype===

In some cases the behaviour we observe in an organism is not due to the expression of their genes, but rather to the genes of parasites infecting them. This behaviour is an [[The Extended Phenotype|extended phenotype]].&lt;ref name="Hughes, D. 2013"/&gt;

===Evolution of host behaviour manipulation===

Three main evolutionary routes have been suggested for the appearance of host behaviour manipulation by parasites. The first is a ''parasite driven'' scenario Of manipulation, while the second and third are ''host driven'' scenarios of manipulation.
#Manipulation ''sensu stricto'' (extended phenotype- abhorrent behaviour displayed by parasitised hosts results from the expression of the parasites genes) this capacity could have been the product of natural selection in an ancestral parasite with the trait.&lt;ref name="Adamo, S. A. 2012 pp.36-51"&gt;Adamo, S. A. (2012) The strings of the puppet master: How parasites change host behaviour in Hughes, D.P., Brodeur, J. &amp; Thomas, F. (Eds.), ''Host Manipulation by Parasites'' (pp.36-51).Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[mafia]]-like strategy- retaliation for non-compliance (eg.[[great spotted cuckoo]] and [[magpie]]) magpies that eject the cuckoos eggs from their nest suffer a much greater rate of cuckoo predation.&lt;ref name="Adamo, S. A. 2012 pp.36-51"/&gt;
#The exploitation of compensatory responses induce host compensatory responses since these may at least partially match with the transmission routes of parasites. E.g. the sexually transmitted ectoparasite ''Chrysomelobia labidomerae'', parasitizing the leaf beetle host ''[[Labidomera clivicollis]]''~ infected males exhibit increased sexual behaviour and as a result enhance inter- and intra- sexual contacts (copulation and competition) which provide more opportunities for parasite transmission.&lt;ref name="Abbot, P. 2001"&gt;Abbot, P. &amp; Dll, L. M. (2001). Sexually transmitted parasites and sexual selection in the milkweed leaf beetle, ''Labidomera clivicollis''. ''Oikos'' '''92''': 91-100&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been suggested that  [[The Extended Phenotype|extended phenotype]] behaviours are not adaptive, but are [[exaptation|Exaptative]].&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. &amp; Vrba, E.S. (1982) Exaptation: a missing term in the science form. ''Paleobiology.'' '''8''':4-15.&lt;/ref&gt; While they may have a benefit for the parasitic organism, they did not arise with the intention of this benefit.&lt;ref name="Abbot, P. 2001"/&gt;

==Parasitic mimicry in brood parasites==
The [[cowbird]] and [[cuckoo]] require the nests and parental care of other [[passerines]] in order for their young to [[fledge]]. These are known as [[brood parasite]]s. The parasitic bird species mimics egg patterns and colours of the host species, which reduces egg rejection.&lt;ref&gt;May, R. M., &amp; Robinson, S.K. (1984) Population dynamics of avian brood parasitism. ''The American Naturalist'' '''126'''(4):475-494.&lt;/ref&gt; The chicks of some species are able to manipulate host behaviour by making rapid calls that mimic the sound made by up to four of the host chicks.&lt;ref&gt;Kilner, R. M., &amp; Davies, N. B. (1999). How selfish is a cuckoo chick? ''Animal Behaviour'' '''58''':797-808.&lt;/ref&gt; Mimicry of the host species also occurs in the paper wasp species ''[[Polistes semenowi]]'' and ''[[Polistes sulcifer]]'' and the bumblebee species ''[[Bombus bohemicus]]'', with the parasite changing its proportions of cuticular hydrocarbons, species- and colony-specific identifying chemicals, to match that of the usurped host species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kreuter, Kirsten; Elfi Bunk (November 23, 2011). "How the social parasitic bumblebee Bombus bohemicus sneaks into power of reproduction". ''Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology'' '''66''' (3): 475–486. doi:10.1007/s00265-011-1294-z. Retrieved 21 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sledge, M.F., Dani, F.R., Cervo, R., Dapporto, L., Turillazzi, S. (2001). “Recognition of social parasites as nestmates: adoption of colony-specific host cuticular odours by the paper wasp parasite Polistes sulcifer”. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B 268: 2253–2260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cervo, R. (2006). ''Polistes'' wasps and their social parasites: an overview. ''Ann. Zool. Fennici'', 43, 531-549.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several butterfly species will also exhibit brood parasitic behavior. An example is ''Niphanda fusca,'' a butterfly that will released cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) to trick the host ant, ''C. japonicus,'' into adopting the larva as their own in their own nest. The ant will then raise the larva of the butterfly, feeding it directly from mouth-to-mouth, until it pupates.&lt;ref&gt;Masaru K Hojo, Ayako Wada-Katsumata, Toshiharu Akino, Susumu Yamaguchi, Mamiko Ozaki, Ryohei Yamaoka (2009). Chemical disguise as particular caste of host ants in the ant inquiline parasite Niphanda fusca (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae). Proceedings of the Royal Society B 2009 276 551-558; DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2008.1064.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is proposed that this mimicry has evolved through two processes: either as coevolutionary responses to host defences against brood parasites or modifying pre-existing host provisioning strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Langmore, N. E. &amp; Spottiswoode, C. N. (2012) Visual Trickery in avian brood parasites in Hughes, D.P., Brodeur, J. &amp; Thomas, F. (Eds.), ''Host Manipulation by Parasites'' (pp.36-51).Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Competition between the parasite and host young for parental resources might lead to exaggeration of the aspects of the signal that most effectively exploit host parents.&lt;ref&gt;Hauber, M. E. &amp; Kilner, R. M. (2007) Coevolution, communication and host-chick mimicry in parasitic finches: who mimics whom? ''Behavioural Ecology and Sociobiology'' '''61''': 497-503.&lt;/ref&gt; The parasitic young are likely to experience stronger selection for exaggerated signals than host young, because they are unrelated to the other chicks in the nest and therefore under selection to behave more selfishly.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtensten, G. (2001). Low success of shiny cowbird chicks parasitizing rufous-bellied thrushes: chick-chick competition or parental discrimination? ''Animal Behaviour'' '''61''':401-413.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of obligate parasitism==
Current theory in [[evolutionary biology]] indicates that host-parasite relationships may evolve towards equilibrial states of severe disease.&lt;ref&gt;Ewald, P.W. (1983). Host-parasite relations, vectors, and the evolution of disease severity. ''Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics'' '''14''':465-485.&lt;/ref&gt;  This differs from the conventional belief that [[commensalism]] is the ideal equilibrium for both the host and parasite.&lt;ref name="Combes, C. 1997"/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], more precisely in [[formal language theory]], the profinite words are the generalization of the notion of finite words into a [[Cauchy completion|complete topological space]]. This notion allows to use [[topology]] to study languages and finite semigroups. For example, profinite words are used to give an alternative characterization to the algebraic notion of [[variety of finite semigroups]].

==Definition==

Let '''A''' an [[Alphabet (formal languages)|alphabet]]. The set of profinite words over '''A''' consists in the [[Completion (topology)|completion]] of a metric space defined on the set &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt; of words over '''A'''. The distance used to define this metric space is defined using a notion of separation of words. Those notions are now defined.

===Separation===
Let '''M''' and '''N''' [[monoid]]s, let '''p''' and '''q''' be elements of the monoid '''M'''. Let '''φ''' a [[morphism]] of monoid from '''M''' to '''N'''. It is said that the morphism φ separates '''p''' and '''q''' if &lt;math&gt;\phi(p)\ne\phi(q)&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the morphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:A^*\to \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z, w\mapsto |w|&lt;/math&gt; sending a words to the parity of its length separates the words '''ababa''' and '''abaa'''. Indeed &lt;math&gt;\phi(ababa)=1\ne0=\phi(abaa)&lt;/math&gt;. 

It is said that '''N''' separates '''p''' and '''q''' if there exists a morphism of monoid φ from '''M''' to '''N''' which separates '''p''' and '''q'''. Using previous example, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; separates '''ababa''' and '''abaa'''. More generally, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; separates any words whose size are not congruent modulo '''n'''. In general, any two distinct words can be separated, using the monoid whose elements are the factors of '''p''' plus a fresh element 0. The morphism sends prefixes of '''p''' to themselves and everything else to 0.

===Distance===
The distance between two distinct words '''p''' and '''q''' is defined as the inverse of the size of the least morphism '''N''' separating '''p''' and '''q'''. Thus, the distance of '''ababa''' and '''abaa''' is &lt;math&gt;\frac12&lt;/math&gt;. The distance of '''p''' and itself is defined as 0.

This distance '''d''' is ultrametric, and furthermore it satisfies &lt;math&gt;d(uw,vw)\le d(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(wu,wv)\le d(u,v)&lt;/math&gt;.

Since any word '''p''' can be separated from any other word using a monoid with '''|p|+1''' elements, where '''|p|''' is the length of '''p''', it follows that the distance between '''p''' and any other word is at least &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{|p|}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the topology defined by this metric is discrete. 
===Profinite topology===
The profinite topology over '''A''', denoted &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt;, is the [[Completion (topology)|completion]] of the set of finite words under the distance defined above. It should be noted that the completion preserve the monoid structure.

The topology &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt; is compact.

Any monoid morphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:A^*\to M&lt;/math&gt;, with '''M''' finite can be extended uniquely into  a morphism &lt;math&gt;\hat\phi:\hat A^*\to M&lt;/math&gt;, and this morphism is uniformly continuous.  Furthermore, it is the least topological space with this property.

===Profinite word===
A profinite word is an element of the profinite topology. And a profinite language is a set of profinite word. Each finite words are profinite words. A few examples of profinite words which are not finite are now given.

For '''m''' any word, let &lt;math&gt;m^\omega&lt;/math&gt; denote &lt;math&gt;\lim_{i\to\infty}m^{i!}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;m^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Cauchy sequence]]. Intuitively, to separate &lt;math&gt;m^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m^{i'!}&lt;/math&gt;, a monoid should count at least up to &lt;math&gt;\min(i,i')&lt;/math&gt;, hence requires at least &lt;math&gt;\min(i,i')&lt;/math&gt; elements. Since &lt;math&gt;m^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Cauchy sequence]], &lt;math&gt;x^\omega&lt;/math&gt; is indeed a profinite word.

Furthermore, the word &lt;math&gt;x^\omega&lt;/math&gt; is idempotent. This is due to the fact that, for any morphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:A^*\to N&lt;/math&gt; with '''N''' finite, &lt;math&gt;\phi(m^{i!})=\phi(m)^{i!}=n^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; for some '''n''' belonging to '''N'''. Since '''N''' is finite, for '''i''' great enough, &lt;math&gt;n^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; is idempotent, and the sequence is constant. 

Similarly, &lt;math&gt;m^{\omega+1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m^{\omega-1}&lt;/math&gt; are defined as &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}m^{n!+ 1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}m^{n!-1}&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

==Profinite languages==
The notion of profinite languages allow to relate notions of [[semigroup theory]] to notions of topology. More precisely, given  '''P''' a profinite language, the following statements are equivalent:
*'''P''' is clopen.
*'''P''' is [[recognizable_set|recognizable]],
*The [[syntactic congruence]] of '''P''' is clopen, as a subset of &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*\times\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt;.

Similar statements also holds for languages '''P''' of finite words.  The following conditions are equivalent.
*&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is recognisable (as a subset of &lt;math&gt;A^*&lt;/math&gt;),
*the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of '''P''', &lt;math&gt;\overline P&lt;/math&gt;, is recognisable (as a subset of &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt;), where 
*&lt;math&gt;P=K\cap A^*&lt;/math&gt;, for some clopen '''K''',
*&lt;math&gt;\overline P&lt;/math&gt; is clopen.

Those characterisations are due to the more general fact that, taking the closure of a finite language, and restricting a profinite language to finite words are inverse operations, when they are applied to recognisable languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4357">'''Pseudorationalism''' was the label given by economist and philosopher [[Otto Neurath]] to a school of thought that he was heavily critical of, throughout many of his writings but primarily in his 1913 paper "The lost wanderers of Descartes and the auxiliary motive" and later to a lesser extent in his 1935 "Pseudorationalismus der Falsifikation",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=Pseudorationalismus der Falsifikation |author=Otto Neurath |journal=[[Erkenntnis]] |year=1935 |volume=5 |number=1 |pages=353–365 |doi=10.1007/BF00172326}}&lt;/ref&gt; a review of and attack on [[Karl Popper|Popper]]'s first book, ''Logik der Forschung'' (''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''), contrasting this approach with his own view of what [[rationalism]] should properly be.{{sfn|Uebel|2008|p=54}}  Neurath aimed his criticism at a [[René Descartes|Cartes]]ian belief that all actions can be subject to rational analysis,{{sfn|Cartwright|Cat|Fleck|Uebel|2008|p=129}}{{sfn|Reisch|2005|p=31}}{{sfn|O'Neill|2008|p=84}} saying that

{{quote|Once reason has gained a certain influence, people generally show a tendency to regard all their actions as reasonable.  Ways of action which depend on dark instincts receive reinterpretation or obfuscation.|{{sfn|Cartwright|Cat|Fleck|Uebel|2008|p=129}} {{harvnb|Neurath|1913|p=441}}}}

Neurath considered that "pseudo-rationalists", be they philosophers or scientists, made the mistake of assuming that a complete rational system could be devised for the [[natural law|laws of nature]].  He argued rather that no system could be complete, being based upon a picture of reality that could only ever be incomplete and imperfect.  Pseudo-rationalism, in Neurath's view, was a refusal or simple inability to face up to the limits of rationality and reason.{{sfn|Cartwright|Cat|Fleck|Uebel|2008|p=129}}  "Rationalism", he wrote {{harv|Neurath|1913|p=8}}, "sees its chief triumph in the clear recognition of the limits of actual insight.".  Whereas a pseudorationalist acknowledges no such limits, but rather contents that ''all'' decisions can be subject to the rules of insight.{{sfn|O'Neill|2008|p=84}}  Scientific method is, according to Neurath, pseudorationalist where it contends that the rules for the [[scientific method]] will always lead ever closer to the truth.{{sfn|O'Neill|2008|p=84}}

Neurath further challenged Cartesian "pseudorationalism" by asserting that operating upon incomplete data was in fact the norm, where Cartesian thinking would have it be the rare exception.  Rather than there being one, final, rational answer to any given problem, Neurath asserted that scientific endeavour required a continuing and never-ending series of choices, made so in part because of the ambiguity of language.{{sfn|Reisch|2005|p=31}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5126">The '''qirad''' was one of the basic financial instruments of the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]].  It was an arrangement between one or more investors and an agent where the investors entrusted capital to an agent who then traded with it in hopes of making profit.  Both parties then received a previously settled portion of the profit, though the agent was not liable for any losses.

== Origins and history ==
Although the qirad is never mentioned in the [[Qur'an]], many Islamic traditions attribute its origin to the Prophet [[Muhammad]] and his companions.  These traditions describe [[Muhammad]] and his companions either using the qirad or endorsing the institution &lt;ref&gt;Avram Udovitch, "Partnership and Profit in Medieval Islam", (Princeton University Press, 1970) p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Many will notice that the qirad is almost identical to the institution of the [[Limited partnership|commenda]] later used in western Europe, though whether the qirad transformed into the commenda, or the two institutions evolved independently cannot be stated with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Hillman, "Limited Liability in Historical Perspective", (Washington and Lee Law Review, Spring 1997), Benedikt Koehler, "Islamic Finance as a Progenitor of Venture Capital", (Economic Affairs, December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal technicalities ==
Though there existed several different major schools of Islamic law, the basic legalities of the qirad were rather uniform throughout the schools.

[[Dinars]] and [[dirhams]], as well as gold, silver, and copper coins in circulation were allowed to be invested.  However, goods such as barley were restricted from the qirad because the possible fluctuations in their value in the free market.&lt;ref&gt;Udovitch op cit pp. 177-181&lt;/ref&gt;

The agent was allowed to take the investment and split up his investments in any way, as well as invest in anything he wanted,&lt;ref&gt;Malik ibn Anas, al-Muwatta', 280-282 (Kegan Paul International, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; except in cases where stocks are plentiful and not seasonally bound.&lt;ref name=MM3235&gt;[http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/malik/032_mmt.html#032.32.3.5 Malik's Muwatta 32.3.5]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also permissible for an investor to forbid the agent from buying certain kinds of goods.&lt;ref name=MM3235/&gt; Many of the third parties involved in the qirad were actually unaware of their involvement which allowed the agent to trade freely and without liability.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman op cit&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the fractional split in profit was agreed on beforehand, the investor could not stipulate a specific sum of the money from the profit, or that a certain profit be made.  In this way, the qirad remained a complete risk on the investor and did not infringe on the free market economy.,&lt;ref&gt;Udovitch op cit, pp. 190-193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malik op cit&lt;/ref&gt; It was however possible to make a deal on the split of the profit beforehand by stipulating a specific percentage. This could be either a low or a high percentage.&lt;ref name=MM3235/&gt;

The principal investment can not be paid back, either by the investor ending the agreement, or the agent ending the agreement, if the principal is still invested in goods. The goods must be sold before the principal can be handed back, and the profits split.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/malik/032_mmt.html#032.32.4.6 Malik's Muwatta 32.4.6]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the investor is allowed to buy goods from the agent if he does not connect any conditions to this transaction.&lt;ref name=MM3223&gt;[http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/malik/032_mmt.html#032.32.2.3 Malik's Muwatta 32.2.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

The agent can also ask the help of a servant of the investor, but this servant also has to share in the profit and can not be asked to do any other work than work connected to the investment.&lt;ref name=MM3235/&gt; A servant can also invest in the same investment as his master and also shares in the profit.&lt;ref name=MM3223/&gt;

If the agent has to hire help for a job, the wage for this person can be paid from the principal, except if the wage should result in loss for the investor, the agent himself is responsible for whatever is not covered by the principal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/malik/032_mmt.html#032.32.6.8 Malik's Muwatta 32.6.8]&lt;/ref&gt;

The agent can use the principal for food and clothes if he should travel for his business, and the principal is large enough to allow it. If he stays at home this is not allowed.&lt;ref name=MM3223/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/malik/032_mmt.html#032.32.8.10 Malik's Muwatta 32.8.10]&lt;/ref&gt;

An agent can invest the money of an investor, the agent then becomes an investor himself, but he is then liable for the losses of the second agent. If the principal decreases, the original investor is allowed to ask the original agent to cover the loss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/malik/032_mmt.html#032.32.7.9 Malik's Muwatta 32.7.9]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Religion''''' is a peer-reviewed [[academic journal]] in the field of [[Religious studies|Religious Studies]]. It was founded in 1971, with close ties to the Religious Studies program at the [[Lancaster University|University of Lancaster]]. That program was founded and chaired by [[Ninian Smart]], and he served as the Chairman of the first editorial board. Four companies have published the journal over the years: Oriel Press (1971–72), [[Routledge|Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul]] (1973–80), [[Academic Press]] (1981–2000), [[Elsevier]] (2001–2010), and currently [[Routledge]].

''Religion'' publishes academic work on all issues of Religious Studies, including the history, literature, thought, practise, material culture, and institutions of particular religious traditions from a variety of perspectives such as social scientific, humanistic, cognitive, economical, geographical, etc. (but excluding work that falls purely within the areas of theology or philosophy of religion). The journal has European and North-American editors (currently [[Michael Stausberg]] and [[Steven Engler]]) and a multi-national Editorial Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?show=editorialBoard&amp;journalCode=rrel20 Publisher site]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medieval music]], the '''rhythmic modes''' were set patterns of long and short [[duration (music)|duration]]s (or [[rhythm]]s). The value of each [[musical notation|note]] is not determined by the form of the written note (as is the case with more recent European musical notation), but rather by its position within a group of notes written as a single figure called a [[Ligature (music)|"ligature"]], and by the position of the ligature relative to other ligatures. '''Modal notation''' was developed by the composers of the [[Notre Dame school]] from 1170 to 1250, replacing the even and unmeasured rhythm of early [[polyphony]] and [[plainchant]] with patterns based on the metric feet of classical poetry, and was the first step towards the development of modern [[mensural notation]] {{harv|Hoppin|1978|loc=221}}. The rhythmic modes of Notre Dame Polyphony were the first coherent system of rhythmic notation developed in Western music since antiquity.

==History==
Though the use of the rhythmic modes is the most characteristic feature of the music of the late [[Notre Dame school]], especially the compositions of [[Pérotin]], they are also predominant in much of the rest of the music of the ''[[ars antiqua]]'' until about the middle of the 13th century. Composition types which were permeated by the modal rhythm include Notre Dame [[organum]] (most famously, the organum triplum and organum quadruplum of Pérotin), [[conductus]], and [[Clausula (music)|discant clausulae]]. Later in the century, the motets by [[Petrus de Cruce]] and the many anonymous composers, which were descended from discant clausulae, also used modal rhythm, often with much greater complexity than was found earlier in the century: for example each voice sometimes sang in a different mode, as well as a different language.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

In most sources there were six rhythmic modes, as first explained in the anonymous treatise of about 1260, ''De mensurabili musica'' (formerly attributed to [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]], who is now believed merely to have edited it in the late 13th century for [[Jerome of Moravia]], who incorporated it into his own compilation) {{harv|Baltzer|2001}}. Each mode consisted of a short pattern of long and short note values ("[[Longa (music)|longa]]" and "[[Double whole note|brevis]]") corresponding to a [[metrical foot]], as follows {{harv|Reese|1940|loc=207–209}}:

# Long-short ([[trochee]])
# Short-long ([[Iamb (foot)|iamb]])
# Long-short-short ([[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]])
# Short-short-long ([[anapaest]])
# Long-long ([[spondee]])
# Short-short-short ([[Tribrach (poetry)|tribrach]])

Although this system of six modes was recognized by medieval theorists, in practice only the first three and fifth patterns were commonly used, with the first mode being by far the most frequent {{harv|Apel|1961|loc=223}}. The fourth mode is rarely encountered, an exception being the second clausula of ''Lux magna'' in MS Wolfenbüttel 677, fol. 44 {{harv|Hughes|1956a|loc=320}}. The fifth mode normally occurs in groups of three and is used only in the lowest voice (or tenor), whereas the sixth mode is most often found in an upper part {{harv|Hughes|1954a|loc=320}}.

Modern transcriptions of the six modes usually are as follows:

# Quarter ([[crotchet]]), eighth ([[quaver]]) (generally [[meter (music)|barred]], therefore, in 3/8 or, because the patterns usually repeat an even number of times, in 6/8 (Apel 1961, 221))&lt;br&gt;[[File:Rhythmic mode 1.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 1.mid|Play X4}}
# Eighth, quarter (barred in 3/8 or 6/8)&lt;br&gt;[[File:Rhythmic mode 2.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 2.mid|Play X4}}
# Dotted quarter, eighth, quarter (barred in 6/8)&lt;br&gt;[[File:Rhythmic mode 3.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 3.mid|Play X2}}
# Eighth, quarter, dotted quarter (barred in 6/8)&lt;br&gt;[[File:Rhythmic mode 4.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 4.mid|Play X2}}
# Dotted quarters (barred in either 3/8 or 6/8)&lt;br&gt;[[File:Rhythmic mode 5.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 5.mid|Play X2}}
# Eighths (barred in 3/8 or 6/8)&lt;br&gt;[[File:Rhythmic mode 6.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 6.mid|Play X4}}
*Cooper (1973, 30) gives the above but doubled in length, thus 1) is {{music|half}} {{music|quarter}} barred in 3/4, for example.
*Riemann (1962, 135) is another modern exception, who also gives the values twice as long, in 3/4 time, but in addition holds that the third and fourth modes were really intended to represent the modern {{music|common-time}}, with duple rhythms ( {{music|half}} {{music|quarter}} {{music|quarter}} and {{music|quarter}} {{music|quarter}} {{music|half}}, respectively).

==Notation==
[[File:Pérotin - Viderunt omnes.jpg|thumb|Pérotin, ''Viderunt omnes'' (Gradual for Christmas Day), in the first rhythmic mode. MS Florence, Biblioteca Medicea-Laurenziana, Pluteo 29.1, fol. 1 recto.]]
Devised in the last half of the 12th century {{harv|Seay|1975|loc=97}}, the notation of rhythmic modes used stereotyped combinations of ligatures (joined noteheads) to indicate the patterns of long notes (longs) and short notes (breves), enabling a performer to recognize which of the six rhythmic modes was intended for a given passage.
Linked notes in groups of:
3, 2, 2, 2, etc. indicate the first mode,
2, 2, 2, 2, … 3 the second mode, 
1, 3, 3, 3, 3, etc. the third mode,
3, 3, 3, … 1 the fourth mode,
3, 3, 3, 3, etc. the fifth mode, 
and 4, 3, 3, 3, etc. the sixth mode
{{harv|Hughes 1954a|loc=323–24}}.
The reading and performance of the music notated using the rhythmic modes was thus based on context. After recognizing which of the six modes applied to a passage of [[neume]]s, a singer would generally continue on in that same mode until the end of a phrase, or a [[cadence (music)|cadence]]. In modern editions of medieval music, ligatures are represented by horizontal brackets over the notes contained within it.

All the modes adhere to a ternary principle of metre, meaning that each mode would have a number of beat subdivisions divisible by the number 3. Some medieval writers explained this as veneration for the perfection of the Holy Trinity, but it appears that this was an explanation made after the event, rather than a cause ({{harvnb|Reese|1940|loc=274}}; {{harvnb|Hughes|1954a|loc=319–20}}). Less speculatively, the flexibility of rhythm possible within the system allows for variety and avoids monotony. Notes could be broken down into shorter units (called ''fractio modi'' by [[Anonymous IV]]) or two rhythmic units of the same mode could be combined into one (''extensio modi'') {{harv|Seay|1975|loc=98–99}}. An alternative term used by Garlandia for both types of alteration was "reduction" {{harv|Roesner|2001}}. These alterations may be accomplished in several ways: ''extensio modi'' by the insertion of single (unligated) long notes or a smaller-than-usual ligature; ''fractio modi'' by the insertion of a larger-than-usual ligature, or by special signs. These were of two types, the ''plica'' and the ''climacus'' {{harv|Hiley and Payne|2001}}.

The ''plica'' was adopted from the liquescent neumes (''cephalicus'') of chant notation, and receives its name (Latin for "fold") from its form which, when written as a separate note, had the shape of a U or an inverted U. In modal notation, however, the plica usually occurs as a vertical stroke added to the end of a ligature, making it a ''ligatura plicata''. The plica usually indicates an added breve on a weak beat {{harv|Hiley and Payne|2001}}. The pitch indicated by the plica depends on the pitches of the note it is attached to and the note following it. If both notes are the same, then the plica tone is the upper or lower neighbor, depending on the direction of the stem. If the interval between the main notes is a third, then the plica tone fills it in as a passing tone. If the two main notes are a second apart, or at an interval of a fourth or larger, musical context must decide the pitch of the plica tone {{harv|Apel|1961|loc=227}}.

[[File:Climacus.gif|thumb|The ''climacus''.]] [[File:Clivis cumpunctis carrée.jpg|thumb|''climacus'' with ligature]]
The ''climacus'' is a rapid descending scale figure, written as a single note or a ligature followed by a series of two or more descending lozenges. Anonymous IV called these ''currentes'' (Latin "running"), probably in reference to the similar figures found in pre-modal Aquitanian and Parisian polyphony. [[Franco of Cologne]] called them ''coniunctura'' (Latin for "joined [note]"). When consisting of just three notes (''coniunctura ternaria'') it is rhythmically identical with the ordinary three-note ligature, but when containing more notes this figure may be rhythmically ambiguous and therefore difficult to interpret {{harv|Hiley and Payne|2001}}. The difficulty was compounded in the later half of the 13th century, when the lozenge shape came also to be used for the [[semibreve]]. A general rule is that the last note is a longa, the second-last note is a breve, and all the preceding notes taken together occupy the space of a longa. However, the exact internal rhythm of these first notes of the group requires some interpretation according to context {{harv|Apel|1961|loc=240}}.

It was also possible to change from one mode to another without a break, which was called "admixture" by Anonymous IV, writing around 1280 {{harv|Roesner|2001}}.

[[File:Alteratio.png|thumbnail|Tenor from Motet "Homo, luge!"/"Homo miserabilis"/"Brumans e mors" (13th century). Third rhythmic mode, syllabic notation.]]
Because a ligature cannot be used for more than one syllable of text, the notational patterns can only occur in [[melisma]]tic passages. Where syllables change frequently or where pitches are to be repeated, ligatures must be broken up into smaller ligatures or even single notes in so-called "syllabic notation", often creating difficulty for the singers, as was reported by Anonymous IV ({{harvnb|Apel|1961|loc=225}}; {{harvnb|Roesner|2001}}).

An '''ordo''' (plural ''ordines'') is a [[phrase (music)|phrase]] constructed from one or more statements of one modal pattern and ending in a rest. Ordines were described according to the number of repetitions and the position of the concluding rest. "Perfect" ordines ended with the first note of the pattern followed by a rest substituting for the second half of the pattern, and "imperfect" ordines ended in the last note of the pattern followed by a rest equal to the first part. Imperfect ordines are mostly theoretical and rare in practice, where perfect ordines predominate {{harv|Hoppin|1978|loc=223}}.

Other writers who covered the topic of rhythmic modes include Anonymous IV, who mentions the names of the composers Léonin and Pérotin as well as some of their major works, and [[Franco of Cologne]], writing around 1260, who recognized the limitations of the system and whose name became attached to the idea of representing the duration of a note by particular notational shapes, though in fact the idea had been known and used for some time before Franco {{harv|Hughes|1954b|loc=379–80}}. Lambertus described nine modes, and Anonymus IV said that, in England, a whole series of irregular modes was in use {{harv|Reece|1940|loc=288}}.

The '''Sambas Treasure''' is a hoard of ancient gold and silver buddhist sculptures found near the town of [[Sambas (town)|Sambas]] in west [[Borneo]] that now form part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?people=136665&amp;peoA=136665-3-7 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Dating from 8th-9th centuries AD, they pre-date the coming of Islam to the [[Indonesia]]n archipelago by four centuries and were probably made in [[Java]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-asia/southeast-asia/maritime-se-asia/a/a-cache-of-buddhist-figures-from-the-sambas-treasure "A Cache of Buddhist figures from the Sambas Treasure"] Khan Academy. Retrieved 2017-08-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Buddhism in Southeast Asia==
Until [[Islam]] became the dominant religion in Indonesia in the 13th Century, both [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] were adopted from the India subcontinent as the principal local religions. Over time, many  buddhist sculptures were transported to the islands by pilgrims returning from holy sites in eastern India.  These in turn inspired local craftsmen who developed their own styles and traits. The buddhist sculptures from Sambas Treasure was almost certainly made in Java based on artistic models that were developed in eastern [[India]] centuries before.

==Discovery and ownership==
The Sambas Treasure was found in a large earthenware pot on the south-west coast of Borneo sometime during the 1940s. It was then owned by the collector Tan Yeok Seong, a [[Singaporean]] historian of [[Southeast Asia]] and a collector of historical artefacts. The treasure was subsequently bought by the [[philanthropist]] PT Brooke Sewell, who donated it to the British Museum in 1956.

==Description==
The hoard is composed of nine gold and silver [[buddha]] and [[bodhisattva]] images. The largest figure is approximately 18&amp;nbsp;cm high and represents a standing Buddha made of sold silver. In addition to the Buddhist sculptures, the treasure includes a bronze [[incense burner]] in the shape of a house and a silver votive plaque with text in [[dhāraṇī]], which was found in the base of the large Buddha figure. The high quality of the craftsmanship and the use of precious metals such as gold and silver suggest they were originally made for an important local dignitary or patron.

A '''sign''' is an [[Physical body|object]], [[quality (philosophy)|quality]], event, or [[entity]] whose presence or occurrence indicates the probable presence or occurrence of something else.&lt;ref&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; A natural sign bears a causal relation to its object—for instance, [[thunder]] is a sign of storm, or medical [[symptom]]s signify a disease. A conventional sign signifies by agreement, as a [[full stop]] signifies the end of a sentence; similarly the words and expressions of a [[language]], as well as bodily [[gesture]]s, can be regarded as signs, expressing particular [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]]. The physical objects most commonly referred to as signs (notices, [[road sign]]s, etc., collectively known as [[signage]]) generally inform or instruct using [[written text]], [[symbol]]s, [[picture]]s or a combination of these.

The philosophical study of signs and [[symbol]]s is called [[semiotics]]; this includes the study of [[semiosis]], which is the way in which [[sign (semiotics)|signs (in the semiotic sense)]] operate.

{{unreferenced|section|date=August 2018}}
[[Semiotics]], [[epistemology]], logic, and [[philosophy of language]] are concerned about the nature of signs, what they are and how they signify.  The nature of signs and symbols and significations, their definition, elements, and types, is mainly established by [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], and [[Aquinas]]. According to these classic sources, significance is a relationship between two sorts of things: signs and the kinds of things they signify (intend, express or mean), where one term necessarily causes something else to come to the mind. Distinguishing natural signs and conventional signs, the traditional theory of signs ([[Augustine]]) sets the following threefold partition of things:
all sorts of indications, evidences, symptoms, and physical signals, there are signs which are ''always'' signs (the entities of the mind as ideas and images, thoughts and feelings, constructs and intentions); and there are signs that ''have'' to get their signification (as linguistic entities and cultural symbols). So, while natural signs serve as the source of signification, the human mind is the agency through which signs signify naturally occurring things, such as objects, states, qualities, quantities, events, processes, or relationships. Human [[language]] and [[discourse]], [[communication]], [[philosophy]], [[science]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[poetry]], [[theology]], and [[religion]] are only some of fields of human study and activity where grasping the nature of signs and symbols and patterns of signification may have a decisive value. Communication takes place without words but via the mind as a result of signs and symbols; They communicate/pass across/ messages to the human mind through their pictorial representation.

== Christianity ==

===St. Augustine and signs===
[[St. Augustine]] was the first man who synthesized the classical and Hellenistic theories of signs. For him a sign is a thing which is used to signify other things and to make them come to mind (''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'' (hereafter DDC) 1.2.2; 2.1.1). The most common signs are spoken and written words (DDC 1.2.2; 2.3.4-2.4.5). Although God cannot be fully expressible, Augustine gave emphasis to the possibility of God’s communication with humans by signs in Scripture (DDC 1.6.6).  Augustine endorsed and developed the classical and Hellenistic theories of signs.  Among the mainstream in the theories of signs, i.e., that of Aristotle and that of Stoics, the former theory filtered into the works of Cicero (106-43 BC, ''De inventione rhetorica'' 1.30.47-48) and Quintilian (circa 35-100, ''Institutio Oratoria'' 5.9.9-10), which regarded the sign as an instrument of inference.  In his commentary on Aristotle’s ''De Interpretatione'', Ammonius said, "according to the division of the philosopher Theophrastus, the relation of speech is twofold, first in regard to the audience, to which speech signifies something, and secondly in regard to the things about which the speaker intends to persuade the audience." If we match DDC with this division, the first part belongs to DDC Book IV and the second part to DDC Books I-III. Augustine, although influenced by these theories, advanced his own theological theory of signs, with whose help one can infer the mind of God from the events and words of Scripture.

Books II and III of DDC enumerate all kinds of signs and explain how to interpret them. Signs are divided into natural (''naturalia'') and conventional (''data''); the latter is divided into animal (''bestiae'') and human (''homines''); the latter is divided into non-words (''cetera'') and words (''verba''); the latter is divided into spoken words (''voces'') and written words (''litterae''); the latter is divided into unknown signs (''signa ignota'') and ambiguous signs (''signa ambigua''); both the former and the latter are divided respectively into particular signs (''signa propria'') and figurative signs (''signa translata''), among which the unknown figurative signs belong to the pagans.
In addition to exegetical knowledge (Quintilian, ''Institutio Oratoria'' 1.4.1-3 and 1.8.1-21) which follows the order of reading (''lectio''), textual criticism (''emendatio''), explanation (''enarratio''), and judgment (''iudicium''),  one needs to know the original language (Hebrew and Greek) and broad background information on Scripture (DDC 2.9.14-2.40.60).

Augustine’s understanding of signs includes several hermeneutical presuppositions as important factors. First, the interpreter should proceed with humility, because only a humble person can grasp the truth of Scripture (DDC 2.41.62). Second, the interpreter must have a spirit of active inquiry and should not hesitate to learn and use pagan education for the purpose of leading to Christian learning,  because all truth is God’s truth (DDC 2.40.60-2.42.63). Third, the heart of interpreter should be founded, rooted, and built up in love which is the final goal of the entire Scriptures (DDC 2.42.63).

The sign does not function as its own goal, but its purpose lies in its role as a signification (''res significans'', DDC 3.9.13). God gave signs as a means to reveal himself; Christians need to exercise hermeneutical principles in order to understand that divine revelation. Even if the Scriptural text is obscure, it has meaningful benefits. For the obscure text prevents us from falling into pride, triggers our intelligence (DDC 2.6.7), tempers our faith in the history of revelation (DDC 3.8.12), and refines our mind to be suitable to the holy mysteries (DDC 4.8.22). When interpreting signs, the literal meaning should first be sought, and then the figurative meaning (DDC 3.10.14-3.23.33). Augustine suggests the hermeneutical principle that the obscure Scriptural verse is interpreted with the help of plain and simple verses, which formed the doctrine of "scriptura scripturae interpres" (Scripture is the Interpreter of Scripture) in the Reformation Era. Moreover, he introduces the seven rules of Tyconius the Donatist to interpret the obscure meaning of the Bible, which demonstrates his understanding that all truth belongs to God (DDC 3.3.42-3.37.56). In order to apply Augustine's hermeneutics of the sign appropriately in modern times, every division of theology must be involved and interdisciplinary approaches must be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B.

'''Simultaneous communication''', '''SimCom''', or '''sign supported speech''' ('''SSS''') is a technique sometimes used by [[deaf]], hard-of-hearing or hearing [[sign language]] users in which both a spoken language and a manual variant of that language (such as [[English language|English]] and [[manually coded English]]) are used simultaneously. While the idea of communicating using two modes of language seems ideal in a hearing/deaf setting, in practice the two languages are rarely relayed perfectly. Often the native language of the user (usually spoken language for the hearing person and sign language for the deaf person) is the language that is strongest, while the non-native language degrades in clarity. In an educational environment this is particularly difficult for deaf children as a majority of teachers who teach the deaf are hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gupress.gallaudet.edu/excerpts/LAADCtwo3.html|title=Language Attitudes in the American Deaf Community|website=gupress.gallaudet.edu|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from surveys taken indicate that communication for students is indeed signing (about 2/3 of the population of students), and that the signing leans more toward English rather than ASL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newell|first=William|last2=Stinson|first2=Michael|last3=Castle|first3=Diane|last4=Mallery-Ruganis|first4=Dominique|last5=Holcomb|first5=Barbara Ray|date=2013-10-02|title=Simultaneous Communication: A Description by Deaf Professionals Working in an Educational Setting|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/507083|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=69|issue=1|pages=391–414|doi=10.1353/sls.1990.0023|issn=1533-6263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History/overview ==
[[Manual communication]], including simultaneous communication, has existed for a while in the United States, but gained traction in the 70's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maxwell|first=Madeline M.|date=2013-10-02|title=Simultaneous Communication: The State of the Art &amp; Proposals for Change|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/507082|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=69|issue=1|pages=333–390|doi=10.1353/sls.1990.0019|issn=1533-6263}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of using signing with children has been a tumultuous one, with many swings between discouraging the use of signed languages and focusing on [[oralism]], to the current push of [[bilingualism]] in Deaf schools. Ultimately, the majority of schools pushed the signed language they used to focus on English, resulting in the birth of a language that combined spoken language (English) with a manual language. The historical use of SC in schools has been stormy, with professionals (both researchers and teachers alike) on either side of the debate on whether the language is useful or not.

== Studies/research ==

===Positive approaches===

According to a study done in 1984, it was found that compared with haphazard instruction involving no language approach whatsoever, Total Communication was proved to be beneficial when combined with the correct approach.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=Mark T.|last2=Calderon|first2=Rosemary|last3=Kusché|first3=Carol|date=1984-01-01|title=Early Intervention Using Simultaneous Communication with Deaf Infants: The Effect on Communication Development|jstor=1129972|journal=Child Development|volume=55|issue=2|pages=607–616|doi=10.2307/1129972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study entitled "Intelligibility of speech produced during simultaneous communication",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Intelligibility of speech produced during simultaneous communication|first1=Robert L|last1=Whitehead|first2=Nicholas|last2=Schiavetti|first3=Douglas J|last3=MacKenzie|first4=Dale Evan|last4=Metz|date=1 May 2004|publisher=|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|volume=37|issue=3|pages=241–253|doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2003.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 12 [[Hearing loss|hearing impaired]] individuals were asked to audit the audio samples of 4 hearing sign language experts who had produced recordings of a Simultaneous Communication (SC) sample and a Speech Alone (SA) sample. The 12 hearing impaired individuals were asked to then determine which speech produced was clearer. After listening to both audio samples, hearing impaired listeners agreed that both SC and SA were intelligible, which is supported by previous research. Since the intelligibility of the speech was kept on par with English grammar, the study results indicate that SC is a positive tool to use with [[Hearing loss|Deaf]] and [[Hearing loss|Hard of Hearing]] children as a language model and for Deaf/Hard of Hearing adults to keep using.

Another study showed the difference between a control group, families who participated in an intervention program that offered services such as classes on Total Communication, private teachers for the child and a deaf adult who came to the families house, and another group of families who used TC, but did not have as much intervention as the control group. The results showed that intervention did work, and that it positively correlated with the communication skills show by the control group's children. The children showed advanced cognitive skills, including comprehension and expression, specifically related to time.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Negative approaches ===

A study done in 1990 titled "The Effectiveness of Three Means of Communication in the College Classroom"&amp;nbsp;by Dennis Cokely reviewed research done previously that supported the use of Total Communication (SimCom) in the classroom. However, the study pointed out several restrictive factors that several research tests had not approached. One of the tests administered only compared SimCom, the [[Rochester Method]] and speech reading with voice ([[lip reading]]), omitting the option of ASL as a means of communication. The 1990 study addressed this issue by comparing SimCom, Sign Alone and Interpretation to see which was the most effective. The results from the comparison showed that signing alone as a way for students to understand information given was the most effective and SimCom was the least effective. Overall, Sign Alone and Interpretation was most effective in all areas of the test, proving that SimCom was a struggle for teachers and students alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cokely|first=Dennis|date=2013-10-02|title=The Effectiveness of Three Means of Communication in the College Classroom|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/507084|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=69|issue=1|pages=415–442|doi=10.1353/sls.1990.0027|issn=1533-6263}}&lt;/ref&gt; When working with two separate modes of communication, the one that comes naturally for the user will be the more prominent mode. A study conducted in 1998 showed that signing and speaking at the same time results in a slower approach to instruction than if just one modality was used to express language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title="Constructing Simultaneous Communication: The Contributions of Natural Sign Language"|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%22Constructing_Simultaneous_Communication:_The_Contributions_of_Natural_Sign_Language%22&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CO2 pump hg.svg|thumb|Air-sea exchange of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
In [[ocean]]ic [[biogeochemistry]], the '''solubility pump''' is a physico-chemical process that transports [[carbon]] (as dissolved inorganic carbon) from the ocean's surface to its interior.

==Overview==
The solubility pump is driven by the coincidence of two processes in the ocean :

* The [[solubility]] of [[carbon dioxide]] is a strong inverse function of [[sea surface temperature|seawater temperature]] (i.e. solubility is greater in cooler water)
* The [[thermohaline circulation]] is driven by the formation of deep water at high latitudes where seawater is usually cooler and denser

Since deep water (that is, seawater in the ocean's interior) is formed under the same surface conditions that promote carbon dioxide solubility, it contains a higher concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon than might be expected from average surface concentrations.  Consequently, these two processes act together to pump carbon from the atmosphere into the ocean's interior.

One consequence of this is that when deep water upwells in warmer, equatorial latitudes, it strongly outgasses carbon dioxide to the atmosphere because of the reduced solubility of the gas.

The solubility pump has a biological counterpart known as the [[biological pump]].  For an overview of both pumps, see Raven &amp; Falkowski (1999).&lt;ref name=raven99&gt;Raven, J. A. and P. G. Falkowski (1999).  [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1046/j.1365-3040.1999.00419.x Oceanic sinks for atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.]  ''Plant Cell Environ.'' '''22''', 741-755.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carbon dioxide solubility==
[[File:Solubility-co2-water.png|thumb|CO2 solubility in water, temperature dependency]]
[[Carbon dioxide]], like other gases, is soluble in water.  However, unlike many other gases ([[oxygen]] for instance), it reacts with water and forms a balance of several ionic and non-ionic species (collectively known as [[Total inorganic carbon|dissolved inorganic carbon]], or DIC).  These are dissolved free carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;), [[carbonic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[bicarbonate]] (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[carbonate]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), and they interact with water as follows :

&lt;center&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

The balance of these carbonate species (which ultimately affects the solubility of carbon dioxide), is dependent on factors such as [[pH]], as shown in a [[Bjerrum plot]].  In [[seawater]] this is regulated by the charge balance of a number of positive (e.g. [[sodium|Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[potassium|K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[magnesium|Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[calcium|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]]) and negative (e.g. CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; itself, [[chlorine|Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[sulfate|SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[bromine|Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]]) ions.  Normally, the balance of these species leaves a net positive charge. With respect to the carbonate system, this excess positive charge shifts the balance of carbonate species towards negative ions to compensate.  The result of which is a reduced concentration of the free carbon dioxide and carbonic acid species, which in turn leads to an oceanic uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to restore balance.  Thus, the greater the positive charge imbalance, the greater the solubility of carbon dioxide.  In carbonate chemistry terms, this imbalance is referred to as [[alkalinity]].

In terms of measurement, four basic parameters are of key importance: '''[[Total inorganic carbon]]''' (TIC, T&lt;sub&gt;CO2&lt;/sub&gt; or C&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;), '''Total [[alkalinity]]''' (T&lt;sub&gt;ALK&lt;/sub&gt; or A&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;), '''pH''', and '''[[partial pressure|pCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]'''.  Measuring any two of these parameters allows for the determination of a wide range of pH-dependent species (including the above-mentioned species).  This balance can be changed by a number of processes.  For example, the [[flux|air-sea flux]] of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[solvation|dissolution]]/[[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of [[Calcium Carbonate|CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], or biological activity such as [[photosynthesis]]/[[cellular respiration|respiration]].  Each of these has different effects on each of the four basic parameters, and together they exert strong influences on global cycles.  The net and local charge of the oceans remains neutral during any chemical process.

==Anthropogenic changes==

The [[combustion]] of [[fossil fuel]]s, land-use changes, and the production of [[cement]] have led to a flux of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the atmosphere.

This was partially due to [[nonlinearity|non-linearities]] in the seawater carbonate system, but also due to [[climate change]].  Ocean warming decreases the solubility of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in seawater, slowing the ocean's response to emissions.

The Biosphere Rules is a framework for implementing closed loop production in business. They emerged from a 2005 research project at [[IE Business School]] that identified the principles that facilitate circular processes in nature but interpreted for&amp;mdash;and translated to&amp;mdash;industrial production systems. The research indicated that adopting the principles allowed businesses to establish economically and environmentally sustainable [[Closed loop manufacturing|closed-loop]] manufacturing systems.

The five principles that constitute the Biosphere Rules are briefly:

'''1. Materials parsimony.'''

Minimize the types of materials used in products with a focus on materials that are life-friendly and economically recyclable.

'''2. Value cycle.'''

Recover and reincarnate materials from end-of-use goods into new value-added products.

'''3. Power autonomy.'''

Maximize the power autonomy of products and processes so they can function on renewable energy.

'''4. Sustainable product platforms.'''

Leverage value cycles as product platforms for profitable scale, scope, and knowledge economies.

'''5. Function over form.'''

Fulfill customers’ functional needs in ways that sustain the value cycle.

This [[Biomimicry|biomimetic]] framework contends that these principles facilitate the transition of human manufacturing systems business towards a functioning circular economy.

== Origins ==
The Biosphere Rules emerged from a research program established through a 2005 partnership between the renowned eco-designer William McDonough and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060206061342/http://www.ceim.ie.edu/ Center for Eco-Intelligent Management] at [http://www.ie.edu/business-school/ IE Business School], a top-ranked European management institute.  The research program identified the attributes of natural systems that allowed for the closed-loop production of organisms in the biosphere. These attributes were then used as a framework for analyzing concrete company examples in the program’s second phase.  Case studies of first mover companies adopting [[Closed loop manufacturing|closed loop]] or [[cradle-to-cradle design]] for product development found common elements that made closed-loop systems viable in a business context. Importantly, the identified elements were similar to the principles seen in natural systems, mapped onto human manufacturing approaches.

The principles were first published in the February 2008 issue the [[Harvard Business Review]] in an article entitled “The Biosphere Rules.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Unruh|first=Gregory|year=2008|title=The Biosphere Rules|url=|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=86.2|pages=111–117|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were later expanded upon in a book entitled “Earth, Inc.: Using Nature’s Rules to Build Sustainable Profits”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Earth, Inc.: Using nature's rules to build sustainable profits|last=Unruh|first=Gregory|publisher=Harvard Business Press|year=2013|isbn=1422127176|location=USA|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2010 by the Harvard Business School Press.

== The Five Biosphere Rules ==

'''Rule #1: Materials Parsimony'''

The Materials Parsimony rule deals with constraining the number of '''types''' of materials used in product design and manufacturing. This is not to be confused with the sustainable business strategy of [[eco-efficiency]] which seeks to reduce the '''amount''' of materials used in production.

The parsimony rule comes instead from applying a biomimicry perspective to materials in the biosphere. The [[Periodic table|Periodic Table of the Elements]] encompass the 88 naturally occurring elements from arsenic to xenon. Yet despite this diversity of options, the biosphere relies on four elements—carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen ([[CHON]])—as the foundation of every living thing on earth. Adding trace amounts of sulfur, phosphorus and calcium we can account for the weight of 99 percent of every living thing on the planet. Parsimony in the biosphere makes it possible break down an organism like a rabbit locally and reassemble its constituent materials into a tree, mushroom or even another rabbit.

The functional benefit of materials parsimony for circular economy is that it dramatically simplifies the logistics and transaction costs of recycling, while producing scale economies through supply concentration.  Applying the Materials Parsimony rule to industry requires simplifying of the number and types of materials used in products. While expecting business to use the same four elements as nature is currently impractical, businesses can dramatically reduce the number of materials employed in manufacture, with a small number doing the yeoman’s work. For special isolated applications, a smaller set of select materials could be reserved and designed to be easily separated from the bulk of the product.  By making these choices, business could absorb a large percent of production within a [[Circular economy|circular materials economy]].

A first step towards materials parsimony that some companies are using is the materials sourcing strategy known as “green screening,” which seeks to exclude potentially hazardous materials from products. Limiting the “materials palette” to environmentally benign inputs at the design stage makes dealing with product and process waste much easier. It also can have the effect of dramatically reducing the number of materials in the product designer’s pallet. Beyond green screening, the emerging strategy of uni-materialization or monomateriality takes the material parsimony approach to its logical extreme by seeking to design products from a single material.

'''Rule #2: Value Cycling'''

The second principle - Value Cycling - refers to the actual cyclical reuse of materials from one high value use to another. It is called a “value cycle” to differentiate from the “[[value chain]]” model that is typical of current production approaches, whereby raw materials are converted into products and then into waste in a linear stepwise process.

In the biosphere, value cycling occurs at the atomic and molecular levels. The same materials that compose a leaf can be decomposed and incorporated into a new tree, a worm or other organisms. Technological limitations generally constrain human manufacturing system’s ability to mimic natural molecular cycling, but the approach can be applied analogously at different levels. Materials in products can be value cycled in “shallow loops” or “deep loops”.

With “shallow-loop” cycling, manufacturers adopt recycling at the “components level” through the [[Remanufacturing|remanufacture]],  refurbishment or reuse of product parts and components. In contrast, “deep-loop” recycling refers to the regeneration at the material level. Currently a limited number of materials can be deep-loop value cycled, such as metals, glass and some plastics. As [[green chemistry]] research results in new polymers that can be recycled at the materials level, greater adoption of deep-loop value cycling approaches can be implemented.

'''Rule #3: Power Autonomy'''

Every transformation of materials in nature - from turtle to tree - requires energy. In nature, the energy source is solar power captured biologically through [[photosynthesis]]. A tree’s captured energy can then be transferred throughout ecosystems through the [[Trophic level|trophic pyramid]] to herbivores and carnivores. Plants and animals also have inherent biological processes that absorb energy and store it in chemical form for later use. [[Solar energy]] therefore serves as the basis of the biosphere’s transformations of material.

Human manufacturing, in contrast, has relied primarily on [[fossil fuel]]s like oil, gas and coal to extract and transform materials. Fossil fuels cannot be considered a sustainable energy solution for many reasons, including the fact that they are finite and their exploitation is reversing important planetary biogeochemical processes producing unwanted climatic and ecosystem impacts. The power autonomy rule applied to human manufacturing requires that products and production processes run on solar-motivated renewable energy sources as in the biosphere.

The power autonomy approach sees this occurring in a two step process.  The first step is to increase the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] products and production processes. As energy efficiency increases new options for generation and energy storage open up because less total energy is needed. The [[renewable energy]] technologies and energy storage technologies can be adopted that move the business towards a state of autonomous power generation.

Power autonomy can be seen from a [[fractal]] perspective in that it can occur at many levels. Power autonomy at the product level would be implemented by designing products that can capture and store their own energy. At the corporate level, a power autonomous company could be one that generates all its energy use from renewable sources. And power autonomy can be considered at the city or state level as in the concept of [[United States energy independence|energy independence]].

'''Rule #4: Sustainable Product Platforms'''

It is estimated that there 8.7 million [[Global biodiversity|species]] on the planet, yet all this diversity is built upon a single materials and energy platform consisting of a solar powered value cycle and a parsimonious materials pallet (CHON).   Nature’s platform allows economies of scale, scope and knowledge that drive the proliferation of species into every habitable niche on the planet. [[Economies of scale|Scale economies]] occur through reproduction and the duplicative growth of species population. [[Economies of scope|Scope economies]], on the other hand, come through speciation, the evolutionary emergence of new species, based on the same platform as individual species. Finally, knowledge economies arise through the accumulative encoding, refining and sharing of survival information genetically overtime in DNA.

The Sustainable Production Platform principle allows businesses to emulate nature’s platform approach in manufacturing and generate similar economies. A sustainable product platform consists of a parsimonious materials palette and associated processing technologies that are assembled into a power autonomous value cycle that is flexible enough to produce a wide variety of products. If managers only use this system to produce a single product, the realized increasing returns would come solely from scale economies (spreading the fixed costs over an increasing unit output). Henry Ford exploited economies of scale by efficiently [[Mass production|mass-producing]] a single car, the Model-T. But by treating the materials-process combination as a fundamental design platform and leveraging it across an entire family of products, managers can foster the scale, scope, and knowledge economies that will continually optimize the value cycle and build larger and more durable returns for their business and society.  In the 1920s, General Motors began exploiting an economy of scope by offering a variety of vehicle designs and brands built on a single automobile design platform.

Sustainable Product Platforms can be built across a spectrum of governance options. At one end manufacturers can [[Vertical integration|vertically integrate]] all the stages of the value cycle retaining full ownership of their materials and product components. At the other extreme, value cycles can be completely open source where materials are value cycled through market forces. This is the case for most commodity recycling today such as steel and aluminum.

'''Rule #5: Function Over Form'''

Throughout the geological record, there is evidence of nature’s constant evolutionary experimentation with life forms. Over billions of years, nature has produced innumerable species in an effort to take advantage of every ecological opportunity. But despite this evident diversity of forms, there are clear patterns in the ecological functions organisms fulfill.  Classes of organisms – producers, predators, pollinators, parasites – serve specific ecosystem functions. The form and its function are encoded in the genes of species, which allow the distributed local manufacturing of organisms necessary to fulfill needed ecosystem functions within the context of a globally integrated system.

In contrast, human manufacturing has tended to emphasize the commercialization of a specific product form rather than the underlying function that the product is intended to serve. Implementing the Biosphere Rules requires that engineers to shift design thinking towards providing a desired function, using the capabilities of the sustainable product platform as a design constraint on form. This approach logically leads to [[Service economy|servicization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothenberg|first=Sandra|year=2007|title=Sustainability through servicizing|url=|journal=MIT Sloan management review|volume=48.2|pages=83|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and product of service strategies.

== Implementation ==
Implementing the Biosphere Rules at an established company require longterm strategic commitments and investment and there are many organizational and other barriers to adopting circular economy practices. The Biosphere Rules, however, were designed in a modular fashion that allows for stepwise implementation. A company can take action to review its input sourcing decisions and move towards greater materials parsimony without having to implement all the other rules simultaneously. Other rules can be implemented in a similar sequential manner which eases the disruption to existing systems and helps facilitate a smooth transition towards a circular business model. However, the ultimate goal is an integrated sustainable business system.

'''''The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception or Mystic Christianity''''' (also known as '''''Western Wisdom Teachings''''') is a [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] text by [[Max Heindel]], first published in 1909.

== Publication history ==
The first edition was printed in November 1909. The order of publication was placed by Max Heindel on the [[New Moon]]&lt;ref&gt;Note: The ''new moon'' is important in [[astrology]], as is the ''full moon''.&lt;/ref&gt; of November 1909 and the book was published a couple of weeks later by the [[Full Moon]], some 5 short weeks before the end of the first decade of the 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Jean de Galzain. Online [RF Friends] announcement of the 100-year centenary of the ''Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception'' and celebration events at [[Mount Ecclesia]] on the weekend of November 13–14-15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It has little changed since then and it is considered to be Max Heindel's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. It is a reference work in the [[Christian mysticism]] practice and in the [[Occult]] study literature, containing the fundamentals of [[Esoteric Christianity]] from a Rosicrucian perspective. The ''Cosmo'' contains a comprehensive outline of the evolutionary process of man and the [[universe]], correlating science with religion. It is, till current days, the basic book for the philosophy courses of the school, the [[Rosicrucian Fellowship]], founded by the author on August 8, 1909.

=== The first dedicatory ===
The first edition of this work, containing more than 700 pages of in depth teachings into the major themes of the ''occult science'', was dedicated to a knowledgeable lecturer of the occult field called [[Rudolf Steiner]], to whom Max Heindel felt greatly indebted. It had the subtitle "Occult Science" instead of "Mystic Christianity" and just above the message and mission ("A Sane Mind, a Soft Heart and a Sound Body", "Service") there was a quotation from [[Paul of Tarsus]]: "PROVE ALL THINGS".
In the subsequent edition, Heindel removed the initial dedication and changed the mentioned elements. The first dedication became a controversial issue among some students of both teachers down to the present. However, as both Heindel and Steiner appear to have been influenced by the same Elder Brother of the [[Rose Cross]], to some extent and at some stage of their lives, it becomes an accessory issue that may only be unveiled through the discernment of the student along her/his path of [[spirituality|spiritual]] unfoldment.

== Contents overview ==
The author talks about the true man and his journey through [[Involution (esoterism)|involution]], [[spiritual evolution]] and epigenesis, presenting practical methods to help the development of latent potentials in each one of us and how to transmute our latency into dynamic powers in order to achieve, according to the author, direct knowledge and conscientious work in the [[Plane (cosmology)|inner planes]].

It deals with many esoteric topics and also [[metaphysics]], [[physiology]] and [[cosmology]] (the visible and invisible worlds, human evolution, [[reincarnation|death and rebirth]], nutrition, esoteric training, ...). It contains a history of the evolution of the human spirit and related bodies (from before awareness, through various incarnations of our planet on various planes, and into the future development) and of animal, vegetable and mineral life waves (the myriad life forms and types of consciousness on this physical plane, experiencing their own points in evolution). It also presents an [[Esoteric knowledge|esoteric interpretation]] about the mission of Christ and an [[occult]] analysis of [[Bible|Biblical]] texts which include the fall of man, the [[Karma|Law of Cause and Consequence]] and Bible and rebirth, and many other themes which were further developed in the subsequent books, lectures and lessons given by the author at the time (1910s) in the United States.

=== Main themes ===
''The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception'' is divided in three parts:&lt;br/&gt;
Part I: the Visible and the Invisible Worlds, Man and the Method of Evolution, Rebirth and the Law of Cause and Effect; &lt;br/&gt;
Part II: the scheme of Evolution in general and the Evolution of the Solar System and the Earth in particular; &lt;br/&gt;
Part III: Christ and His Mission, Future Development of Man and Initiation, Esoteric Training and a Safe Method of Acquiring Firsthand Knowledge.

== The Rosicrucian conception of God and the scheme of evolution ==
According to the ''Western Wisdom Teachings'', in the beginning of a ''Day of Manifestation'' a certain collective Great Being, God, limits Himself to a certain portion of space, in which He elects to create a [[Solar System]] for the evolution of added [[self (philosophy)|self]]-[[consciousness]].
[[File:Europe a Prophecy, copy D, object 1 (Bentley 1, Erdman i, Keynes i) British Museum.jpg|right|thumb|210px|''[[The Ancient of Days]]'', illustrated by [[William Blake]] (1794)]]
&lt;!---"Both poet and artist, Blake illustrated his own poetic work. He also labored to create his own cosmology and mythology, based upon his readings of the Bible, the teachings of Swedenborg, and his own besetting visions. This illustration suggests a gnostic approach to the Creator as a lesser, fallible God, though the visual suggestion of compasses, which Blake associated with materialism and a constricted, Newtonian view of reality."---&gt;
In God there are contained hosts of glorious Hierarchies and lesser beings of every grade of intelligence and stage of [[consciousness]], from [[omniscience]] to an [[unconsciousness]] deeper than that of the deepest [[altered state of consciousness|trance condition]].
During the current period of manifestation these various grades of beings are working to acquire more experience than they possessed at the beginning of this period of existence. Those who, in previous manifestations, have attained the highest degree of development work on those who have not yet evolved any consciousness.

The period of time devoted to the attainment of self-consciousness and to the building of the [[Subtle body|vehicles]] through which the spirit in man manifests, is called "[[Involution (esoterism)|Involution]]". The succeeding period of existence, during which the individual human being develops ''[[self-consciousness]]'' into ''[[divinity|divine]] [[omniscience]]'', is called "[[Spiritual evolution|Evolution]]". Every evolving being has within him a "force" which makes evolution not to be a mere enfoldment of latent germinal possibilities but a process where each individual differ from that of every other. This force, called "Epigenesis", provides the element of [[originality]] and gives scope to the creative ability which the evolving being is to cultivate that he may become a God.

''The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception'' describes that in the [[Solar system]], God's Habitation, there are [[Rosicrucian Fellowship#The Seven Worlds .26 the Seven Cosmic Planes|seven Worlds]] differentiated by God, within Himself, one after another.&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception''; Diagram 2: [http://www.rosicrucian.com/images/rccen002.gif The Seven Worlds]&lt;/ref&gt; These Worlds have each a different "measure" and rate of [[oscillation|vibration]] and are not separated by [[space]] or [[distance]], as is the earth from the other planets. They are states of [[matter]], of varying [[density]] and [[vibration]] (as are the solids, liquids and gases of the physical [[Earth]]). These Worlds are not instantaneously created at the beginning of a day of Manifestation, nor do they last until the end. The evolutionary scheme is carried through five of these Worlds in seven great Periods of manifestation, during which the evolving virgin [[spirit]] becomes first human and then a God.
The highest Worlds are created first, and as involution is to slowly carry the life into denser and denser matter for the building of forms, the finer Worlds gradually [[condense]] and new Worlds are differentiated within God to furnish the necessary links between Himself and the Worlds which have consolidated. In due time the point of greatest density, the [[nadir]] of materiality, is reached. From that point the life begins to ascend into higher Worlds, as [[Spiritual evolution|evolution]] proceeds. That leaves the denser Worlds depopulated, one by one. When the purpose has been served for which a particular World was created, God ends its existence, which has become superfluous, by ceasing within Himself the particular activity which brought into being and sustained that World.&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''Idem''; Diagram 8: [http://www.rosicrucian.com/images/rccen008.gif The 7 7 7 Incarnations]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{God|by religion}}
The Rosicrucians teach that the above referred seven Worlds belong to the lowest of the seven "Cosmic Planes". The Worlds and Cosmic Planes are not one above another in space, but the seven Cosmic Planes inter-penetrate each other and all the seven Worlds. They are states of [[spirit]]-[[matter]], permeating one another, so that God and the other great Beings pervade every part of their own realms and realms of greater density than their own, including our world: "''in Him we live and move and have our being''". Proceeding from the [[physical plane|physical world]] to the [[Plane (cosmology)|inner worlds]], '''God''' - the "Architect of the Solar System", the Source and goal of human existence&amp;nbsp;– is found in the highest division of the seventh Cosmic Plane: this is His World. In order to trace the origin of the Architect of the Solar System, one must pass to the highest of the seven Cosmic Planes: the "Realm of the '''Supreme Being'''", Who emanated from "The Absolute". '''The Absolute''' is beyond comprehension and, as [[wikt:manifestation|manifestation]] implies limitation, He may be best described as "Boundless Being": the "Root of Existence".

From [[The Absolute]] proceeds the [[Supreme Being]], at the dawn of manifestation: this is ''The One'', the "[[Great Architect of the Universe]]". The first aspect of the Supreme Being may be characterized as ''Power'', from this proceeds the second aspect, ''the Word'', and from both of these proceeds the third, aspect, ''Motion''. From the threefold Supreme Being proceed the "seven Great [[Logos|Logoi]]". They contain within Themselves all the great Hierarchies which differentiate more and more as they diffuse through the various Cosmic Planes.&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''Idem''; Diagram 6: [http://www.rosicrucian.com/images/rccen006.gif The Supreme Being, the Cosmic Planes and God]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Highest World of the seventh Cosmic Plane dwells the God of the [[Planetary system|Solar Systems]] in the [[Universe]]. These great Beings are also threefold in manifestation, like the Supreme Being. Their three aspects are ''Will'', ''Wisdom'' and ''Activity''.

== Comments about the ''Cosmo'' ==

=== The author's perspective ===

By Max Heindel in ''A Word to the Wise'':

*''If the book is "weighed and found wanting," the writer will have no complaint. He only fears a hasty judgment based upon lack of knowledge of the system he advocates—a hearing wherein the judgment is "wanting" in consequence of having been denied an impartial "weighing." He would further submit, that the only opinion worthy of the one who expresses '''it must be based upon knowledge.'''''
*''Yet he is convinced that The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception is far from being the last word on the subject.''
*''The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception is not dogmatic, neither does it appeal to any other authority than the reason of the student.''
*''The Rosicrucian Brotherhood has the most far-reaching, the most logical conception of the World-Mystery (...)''
*''It is emphatically stated that '''this work embodies only the writer's understanding of the Rosicrucian teachings''' concerning the World-Mystery (...)''
*''What is said in this work is to be accepted or rejected by the reader according to his own discretion.''
---
*Now, perhaps you will understand my attitude towards the Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception. I admire and marvel at its wonderful teaching more than anyone else, and can do so without violating proper modesty for the book is not mine—it belongs to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;The Rosicrucian Fellowship.

=== A critical essay ===

By Charles Weber in ''The Mystic and Occult in Max Heindel's Writings'':&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Charles. ''[http://www.fraternidaderosacruz.org/rc_cw_maoimht.htm The Mystic and Occult in Max Heindel's Writings]''. Accessed in February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Cosmo’s author has "an unswerving desire, a burning thirst for knowledge", which is "the first and central requisite the aspirant to occult knowledge must possess", but with this qualification, that "the supreme motive for seeking this occult knowledge must be an ardent desire to benefit humanity" (22). "Another prerequisite to this first-hand knowledge, however, is the study of occultism second-hand" (23). It is the purpose of the Cosmo to make that second-hand study of occultism possible. Occult science is the science of what occurs occultly insofar as it is not perceived in external nature, but in that region toward which the soul turns when it directs its inner being toward the spirit.
*Heindel emphasizes the facticity of the Cosmo’s contents and the rigor and objectivity of his sources by using the term occult scientist(s) thirty times and occult science twenty-five times. The occultist (used twenty times) "knows" and "sees" what he is reporting on. "The occult scientist uses concentration in preference to prayer because the former is accomplished by the aid of the mind, which is cold and unfeeling, whereas prayer is usually dictated by emotion" (463). That is, concentration is more impersonal, and therefore more reliable. However, when emotion is replaced by a mystic’s "pure unselfish devotion to high ideals, prayer is much higher than cold concentration" (ibid).

The '''trihydrogen cation''', also known as '''protonated molecular hydrogen''' or '''{{chem|H|3|+}}''', is one of the most abundant [[ion]]s in the universe. It is stable in the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) due to the low temperature and low density of interstellar space. The role that {{chem|H|3|+}} plays in the gas-phase chemistry of the ISM is unparalleled by any other molecular ion. The [[cation]] is also the simplest triatomic [[molecule]], since its two electrons are the only valence electrons in the system. It is also the simplest example of a [[three-center two-electron bond]] system.

==History==
{{chem|H|3|+}} was first discovered by [[J. J. Thomson]] in 1911.&lt;ref name="elecrays"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thomson |first=J. J. |date=1913 |title=Rays of Positive Electricity |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] |volume=89 |issue=607 |pages=1–20 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1913.0057 |bibcode = 1913RSPSA..89....1T }}&lt;/ref&gt; While studying the resultant species of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] discharges, he discovered something very odd. Using an early form of [[mass spectrometry]], he discovered a large abundance of a [[molecular]] ion with a [[mass-to-charge ratio]] of 3. He stated that the only two possibilities were C&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; or {{chem|H|3|+}}. Since C&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; would be very unlikely and the signal grew stronger in pure [[hydrogen]] gas, he correctly assigned the species as {{chem|H|3|+}}.

The formation pathway was discovered by Hogness &amp; Lunn in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hogness |first=T. R. |author2=Lunn, E. G. |date=1925 |title=The Ionization of Hydrogen by Electron Impact as Interpreted by Positive Ray Analysis |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=44–55 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.26.44 |bibcode = 1925PhRv...26...44H }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also used an early form of mass spectrometry to study hydrogen discharges. They found that as the pressure of hydrogen increased, the amount of {{chem|H|3|+}} increased linearly and the amount of {{chem|H|2|+}} decreased linearly. In addition, there was little H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; at any pressure. This data suggested the [[proton]] exchange formation pathway discussed below.

In 1961, Martin ''et al.'' first suggested that {{chem|H|3|+}} may be present in interstellar space given the large amount of hydrogen in interstellar space and its reaction pathway was [[exothermic]] (~1.5&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|eV]]).&lt;ref name="occurrence"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=D. W. |author2=McDaniel, E. W. |author3=Meeks, M. L. |date=1961 |title=On the Possible Occurrence of {{chem|H|3|+}} in Interstellar Space |journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=134 |page=1012 |doi= 10.1086/147232|bibcode=1961ApJ...134.1012M}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the suggestion of Watson and Herbst &amp; Klemperer in 1973 that {{chem|H|3|+}} is responsible for the formation of many observed molecular ions.&lt;ref name="Watson1973"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Watson |first=W. D. |date=1973 |title=The Rate of Formation of Interstellar Molecules by Ion-Molecule Reactions |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=183 |issue=2 |pages=L17 |doi=10.1086/181242 |bibcode=1973ApJ...183L..17W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herbst |first=E. |author2=Klemperer, W. |date=1973 |title=The Formation and Depletion of Molecules in Dense Interstellar Clouds |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=185 |page=505 |doi=10.1086/152436 |bibcode=1973ApJ...185..505H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until 1980 that the first spectrum of {{chem|H|3|+}} was discovered by Takeshi Oka,&lt;ref name="Oka1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oka |first=T. |date=1980 |title=Observation of the Infrared Spectrum of {{chem|H|3|+}} |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=45 |issue= 7|pages=531–534 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.45.531 |bibcode=1980PhRvL..45..531O}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was of the ν&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fundamental band using a technique called [[frequency modulation]] detection. This started the search for interstellar {{chem|H|3|+}}. [[Emission line]]s were detected in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the [[ionosphere]]s of [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], and [[Uranus]].&lt;ref name="Drossart1989"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drossart |first=P. |display-authors=etal |date=1989 |title=Detection of {{chem|H|3|+}} on Jupiter |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=340 |issue=6234 |page=539 |doi=10.1038/340539a0 |bibcode = 1989Natur.340..539D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geballe1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Geballe |first=T. R. |display-authors=etal |date=1993 |title=Detection of {{chem|H|3|+}} Infrared Emission Lines in Saturn |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=408 |issue=2 |pages=L109 |doi=10.1086/186843 |bibcode=1993ApJ...408L.109G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trafton1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trafton |first=L.

In 1996, {{chem|H|3|+}} was finally detected in the interstellar medium (ISM) by Geballe &amp; Oka in two molecular [[interstellar clouds]] in the sightlines GL2136 and W33A.&lt;ref name="Geballe1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Geballe |first=T. R. |author2=Oka, T. |date=1996 |title=Detection of {{chem|H|3|+}} in Interstellar Space |journal=Nature |volume=384 |issue=6607 |pages=334–335 |doi=10.1038/384334a0 |pmid=8934516 |bibcode = 1996Natur.384..334G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, {{chem|H|3|+}} was unexpectedly detected by McCall ''et al.'' in a diffuse interstellar cloud in the sightline [[Cygnus OB2-12|Cygnus OB2#12]].&lt;ref name="McCall1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCall |first=B. J. |display-authors=etal |date=1998 |title=Detection of {{chem|H|3|+}} in the Diffuse Interstellar Medium Toward Cygnus OB2 No. 12 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=279 |issue=5358 |pages=1910–1913 |doi=10.1126/science.279.5358.1910 |bibcode = 1998Sci...279.1910M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Oka announced that {{chem|H|3|+}} was ubiquitous in interstellar medium, and that the [[Central Molecular Zone]] contained a million times the concentration of ISM generally.&lt;ref&gt;PNAS, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trihydrogen-cation-MO-diagram.svg|thumb|380px|The [[MO diagram]] of the trihydrogen cation.]]
The three hydrogen atoms in the molecule form an [[equilateral triangle]], with a [[bond length]] of 0.90&amp;nbsp;[[Ångström|Å]] on each side. The bonding among the atoms is a [[three-center two-electron bond|three-centre two-electron bond]], a [[delocalized]] resonance hybrid type of structure. The strength of the bond has been calculated to be around 4.5&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] (104&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCall |first=B. J. |display-authors=etal |date=2004 |title=Dissociative Recombination of Rotationally Cold {{chem|H|3|+}} |journal=Physical Review A |volume=70 |issue=5 |page=052716 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.70.052716 |bibcode = 2004PhRvA..70e2716M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
&lt;!--The information for this section was from a paper by Eric Herbst.--&gt;The main pathway for the production of {{chem|H|3|+}} is by the reaction of [[Dihydrogen cation|{{chem|H|2|+}}]] and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="eherbstastro"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herbst |first=E. |date=2000 |title=The Astrochemistry of {{chem|H|3|+}} |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]]|volume=358 |issue=1774 |pages=2523–2534 |doi=10.1098/rsta.2000.0665 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{chem|H|2|+}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|H|3|+}} + H

The concentration of {{chem|H|2|+}} is what limits the rate of this reaction in nature: the only known natural source of it is via ionization of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by a [[cosmic ray]] in interstellar space by the ionization of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + cosmic ray → {{chem|H|2|+}} + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + cosmic ray

The cosmic ray has so much energy, it is almost unaffected by the relatively small energy transferred to the hydrogen when ionizing an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule. In interstellar clouds, cosmic rays leave behind a trail of {{chem|H|2|+}}, and therefore {{chem|H|3|+}}. In laboratories, {{chem|H|3|+}} is produced by the same mechanism in plasma discharge cells, with the discharge potential providing the energy to ionize the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Destruction==
The information for this section was also from a paper by Eric Herbst.&lt;ref name="eherbstastro" /&gt; There are many destruction reactions for {{chem|H|3|+}}. The dominant destruction pathway in dense interstellar clouds is by proton transfer with a neutral collision partner. The most likely candidate for a destructive collision partner is the second most abundant molecule in space, [[carbon monoxide|CO]].

:{{chem|H|3|+}} + CO → HCO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The significant product of this reaction is HCO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, an important molecule for interstellar chemistry. Its strong [[dipole]] and high abundance make it easily detectable by [[radioastronomy]]. {{chem|H|3|+}} can also react with atomic [[oxygen]] to form OH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

:{{chem|H|3|+}} + O → OH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

OH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; then usually reacts with more H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to create further [[hydrogenate]]d molecules.

:OH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|OH|2|+}} + H
:{{chem|OH|2|+}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → [[Hydronium|{{chem|OH|3|+}}]] + H

At this point, the reaction between {{chem|OH|3|+}} and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is no longer exothermic in interstellar clouds. The most common destruction pathway for {{chem|OH|3|+}} is [[dissociative recombination]], yielding four possible sets of products: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H, OH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, OH + 2H, and O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H. While [[water]] is a possible product of this reaction, it is not a very efficient product. Different experiments have suggested that water is created anywhere from 5–33% of the time. Water formation on [[cosmic dust|grains]] is still considered the primary source of water in the interstellar medium.

The most common destruction pathway of {{chem|H|3|+}} in diffuse interstellar clouds is dissociative recombination. This reaction has multiple products. The major product is dissociation into three hydrogen atoms, which occurs roughly 75% of the time. The minor product is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H, which occurs roughly 25% of the time.

==Ortho/Para-H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;==
[[Image:H3+&amp;H2.svg|thumb|350px|A collision of ortho-{{chem|H|3|+}} and para-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
The most abundant molecule in dense interstellar clouds is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. When a {{chem|H|3|+}} molecule collides with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, stoichiometrically there is no net yield. However, a proton transfer still can take place, which can potentially change the total [[spin (physics)|nuclear spin]] of the two molecules depending on the nuclear spins of the protons. Two different spin configurations for {{chem|H|3|+}} are possible, called ortho and para. Ortho-{{chem|H|3|+}} has all three proton spins parallel, yielding a total nuclear spin of {{sfrac|3|2}}. Para-{{chem|H|3|+}} has two proton spins parallel while the other is anti-parallel, yielding a total nuclear spin of {{sfrac|1|2}}. Similarly, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also has [[Spin isomers of hydrogen|ortho and para states]], with ortho-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; having a total nuclear spin 1 and para-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; having a total nuclear spin of 0. When an ortho-{{chem|H|3|+}} and a para-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; collide, the transferred proton changes the total spins of the molecules, yielding instead a para-{{chem|H|3|+}} and an ortho-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="eherbstastro" /&gt;

==Spectroscopy==
The [[spectroscopy]] of {{chem|H|3|+}} is challenging. The pure rotational spectrum is exceedingly weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = J.K.G | year = 1971 | title = Forbidden rotational spectra of polyatomic molecules | url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 546–544 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2852(71)90255-4 | bibcode = 1971JMoSp..40..536W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultraviolet light is too energetic and would dissociate the molecule. [[Rovibronic excitation|Rovibronic]] (Infrared) spectroscopy provides the ability to observe {{chem|H|3|+}}. Rovibronic spectroscopy is possible with {{chem|H|3|+}} because one of the [[normal mode|vibrational modes]] of {{chem|H|3|+}}, the ν&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; asymmetric bend mode, has a weak transition dipole moment. Since Oka's initial spectrum,&lt;ref name="Oka1980" /&gt; over 900 [[Absorption spectroscopy|absorption]] lines have been detected in the infrared region. {{chem|H|3|+}} emission lines have also been found by observing the atmospheres of the Jovian planets. {{chem|H|3|+}} emission lines are found by observing molecular hydrogen and finding a line that cannot be attributed to molecular hydrogen.

==Astronomical detection==
{{chem|H|3|+}} has been detected in two types of celestial environments: Jovian planets and interstellar clouds. In Jovian planets, it has been detected in the planet's ionospheres, the region where the Sun's high energy radiation ionizes the particles in the atmosphere. Since there is a high level of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in these atmospheres, this radiation can produce a significant amount of {{chem|H|3|+}}. Also, with a broadband source like the Sun, there is plenty of radiation to pump the {{chem|H|3|+}} to higher energy states from which it can relax by stimulated and spontaneous emission.

===Planetary atmospheres===
The detection of the first {{chem|H|3|+}} emission lines was reported in 1989 by Drossart ''et al.'',&lt;ref name="Drossart1989" /&gt; found in the ionosphere of Jupiter. Drossart found a total of 23 {{chem|H|3|+}} lines with a column density of 1.39{{e|9}}/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Using these lines, they were able to assign a temperature to the {{chem|H|3|+}} of around {{convert|1100|K|°C|abbr=on}}, which is comparable to temperatures determined from emission lines of other species like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In 1993, {{chem|H|3|+}} was found in Saturn by Geballe ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Geballe1993" /&gt; and in Uranus by Trafton ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Trafton1993" /&gt;

===Molecular interstellar clouds===
{{chem|H|3|+}} was not detected in the interstellar medium until 1996, when Geballe &amp; Oka reported the detection of {{chem|H|3|+}} in two molecular cloud sightlines, GL2136 and W33A.&lt;ref name="Geballe1996" /&gt; Both sources had temperatures of {{chem|H|3|+}} of about {{convert|35|K|°C|0|abbr=on}} and column densities of about 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Since then, {{chem|H|3|+}} has been detected in numerous other molecular cloud sightlines, such as AFGL 2136,&lt;ref name="McCall1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCall|first=B. J.|display-authors=etal |date=1999|title=Observations of {{chem|H|3|+}} in Dense Molecular Clouds|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=522|issue=1|pages=338–348|doi=10.1086/307637|bibcode=1999ApJ...522..338M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mon R2 IRS 3,&lt;ref name="McCall1999" /&gt; GCS 3-2,&lt;ref name="mgoto"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goto|first=M.|display-authors=etal |date=2002|title=Absorption Line Survey of {{chem|H|3|+}} toward the Galactic Center Sources I.

===Diffuse interstellar clouds===
Unexpectedly, three {{chem|H|3|+}} lines were detected in 1998 by McCall ''et al.'' in the diffuse cloud sightline of Cyg OB2 No. 12.&lt;ref name="McCall1998" /&gt; Before 1998, the density of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was thought to be too low to produce a detectable amount of {{chem|H|3|+}}. McCall detected a temperature of ~{{convert|27|K|°C|0|abbr=on}} and a column density of ~10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the same column density as Geballe &amp; Oka. Since then, {{chem|H|3|+}} has been detected in many other diffuse cloud sightlines, such as GCS 3-2,&lt;ref name="mgoto" /&gt; GC IRS 3,&lt;ref name="mgoto" /&gt; and ζ Persei.&lt;ref name="McCall2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCall|first=B. J.|display-authors=etal |date=2003|title=An Enhanced Cosmic-ray Flux towards ζ Persei Inferred from a Laboratory Study of the {{chem|H|3|+}}-e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Recombination Rate|journal=Nature|volume=422|issue=6931|doi=10.1038/nature01498|pmid=12673244|arxiv = astro-ph/0302106 |bibcode = 2003Natur.422..500M|pages=500–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steady-state model predictions===
To approximate the pathlength of {{chem|H|3|+}} in these clouds, Oka&lt;ref name="Oka2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oka|first=T.|date=2006|title=Interstellar H3+|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]]|volume=103|issue=33|pages=12235–12242|doi=10.1073/pnas.0601242103|pmid=16894171|pmc=1567864|bibcode = 2006PNAS..10312235O }}&lt;/ref&gt; used the steady-state model to determine the predicted number densities in diffuse and dense clouds. As explained above, both diffuse and dense clouds have the same formation mechanism for {{chem|H|3|+}}, but different dominating destruction mechanisms. In dense clouds, proton transfer with CO is the dominating destruction mechanism. This corresponds to a predicted number density of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; in dense clouds.
:''n''({{chem|H|3|+}}) = (''ζ'' / ''k''&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;)[''n''(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) / ''n''(CO)] ≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:''n''({{chem|H|3|+}}) = (''ζ'' / ''k''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;)[''n''(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) / ''n''(C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)] ≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
In diffuse clouds, the dominating destruction mechanism is dissociative recombination. This corresponds to a predicted number density of 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in diffuse clouds. Therefore, since column densities for diffuse and dense clouds are roughly the same order of magnitude, diffuse clouds must have a pathlength 100 times greater than that for dense clouds. Therefore, by using {{chem|H|3|+}} as a probe of these clouds, their relative sizes can be determined.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13906">'''Visceral pain''' is pain that results from the activation of [[nociceptors]] of the thoracic, pelvic, or abdominal [[viscera]] (organs). Visceral structures are highly sensitive to distension (stretch), [[ischemia]] and [[inflammation]], but relatively insensitive to other stimuli that normally evoke pain such as cutting or burning. Visceral pain is diffuse, difficult to localize and often referred to a distant, usually superficial, structure. It may be accompanied by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, changes in vital signs as well as emotional manifestations. The pain may be described as sickening, deep, squeezing, and dull.&lt;ref&gt;Urch CE &amp; Suzuki R. Pathophysiology of somatic, visceral, and neuropathic cancer pain. In: Sykes N, Bennett MI &amp; Yuan C-S. Clinical pain management: Cancer pain. 2 ed. London: Hodder Arnold; {{ISBN|9780340940075}}. p. 3–12&lt;/ref&gt; Distinct structural lesions or biochemical abnormalities explain this type of pain in only a proportion of patients. These diseases are grouped under gastrointestinal neuromuscular diseases (GINMD). Others can experience occasional visceral pains, often very intense in nature, without any evidence of structural, biochemical or histolopathologic reason for such symptoms. These diseases are grouped under [[functional gastrointestinal disorders]] (FGID) and the pathophysiology and treatment can vary greatly from GINMD. The two major single entities among functional disorders of the gut are [[functional dyspepsia]] and [[irritable bowel syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;Gschossmann JM, Holtmann G, Mayer EA. Epidemiology and clinical phenomenology of visceral pain Schmerz. 2002 Dec;16(6):447-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visceral hypersensitivity'''&lt;!--per MOS:BOLD since term redirects here--&gt; is a term used to describe hypersensitive visceral pain perception, which is commonly experienced by individuals with [[functional gastrointestinal disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="FGID mast cell"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wouters MM, Vicario M, Santos J | title = The role of mast cells in functional GI disorders | journal = Gut | volume = 65| issue = | pages = 155–168| year = 2015 | pmid = 26194403 | doi = 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309151 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==

In the past viscera were considered insensitive to pain but now it is clear that pain from internal organs is widespread and that its social burden may surpass that of pain from superficial ([[Somatic nervous system|somatic]]) sources. Myocardial ischemia, the most frequent cause of cardiac pain, is the most common cause of death in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman DHS. Curr Rev Pain 1999; 3(4):291–299&lt;/ref&gt; Urinary colic produced from ureteral stones has been categorized as one of the most intense forms of pain that a human being can experience. The prevalence of such stones has continuously increased, reaching values of over 20% in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Trinchieri A | year = 2000 | title = Increase in the Prevalence of Symptomatic Upper Urinary Tract Stones during the Last Ten Years| url = | journal = Eur Urol | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 23–25 |display-authors=etal|doi=10.1159/000020094|pmid=10671780}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vasavada PV, et al. In: Loeser JD (Ed). Bonica's Management of Pain. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2001, pp 1309–1325&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys have shown prevalence rates among adults of 25% for intermittent abdominal pain and 20% for chest pain; 24% of women suffer from pelvic pain at any point in time. For over two-thirds of sufferers, pain is accepted as part of daily life and symptoms are self-managed; a small proportion defer to specialists for help. Visceral pain conditions are associated with diminished quality of life, and exert a huge cost burden through medical expenses and lost productivity in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Smita L.S. Halder and G. Richard Locke III Epidemiology and social impact of visceral pain Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinical presentation ==

Visceral pain should be suspected when vague midline sensations of [[malaise]] are reported by a patient. True visceral pain is characterized as a vague, diffuse, and poorly defined sensation.&lt;ref name=twelve&gt;Procacci P, et al. In: Cervero F, Morrison JFB (Eds). Visceral Sensation, Progress in Brain Research, Vol. 67. Amsterdam: Elsevier, 1986, pp 21–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fourteen&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vecchiet L | year = 1989 | title = Pain from renal/ureteral calculosis: evaluation of sensory thresholds in the lumbar area | url = | journal = Pain | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 289–295 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1016/0304-3959(89)90087-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of specific organ of origin, the pain is usually perceived in the midline spanning anywhere from the lower abdomen up to the chest. In the early phases the pain is perceived in the same general area and it has a temporal evolution, making the onset sensation insidious and difficult to identify.&lt;ref name=thirteen&gt;Giamberardino MA. ''Eur J Pain'' 1999; 3(2):77–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pain is typically associated with involvement of the [[autonomic nervous system]]. Some of these symptoms include pallor, sweating, nausea, vomit, changes in [[vital signs]] including [[blood pressure]], [[heart rate]] and/or temperature. Strong emotional reactions are also common presenting signs and may include anxiety, anguish and a sense of impending doom. Visceral pathology may also manifest only through emotional reactions and discomfort where no pain is reported. The intensity of visceral pain felt might have no relationship to the extent of internal injury.&lt;ref name=thirteen /&gt;&lt;ref name=fifteen&gt;Cervero F" ''Gut'' 2000; 47:56–57&lt;/ref&gt;

Visceral pain changes in nature as it progresses. Pain from a specific organ can be experienced, or "referred" to different sites of the body. There is no [[pathology]] or no cause for pain at these referred [[Somatic nervous system|somatic]] sites however the pain will be experienced at this location, often with significant intensity. [[Referred pain]] is sharper, better localized, and less likely to be accompanied by autonomic or emotional signs.&lt;ref name=fourteen /&gt;&lt;ref name=fifteen /&gt;

A good example of visceral pain that is common place and embodies the wide spectrum of clinical presentations discussed above is a [[myocardial infarction]] (MI), more commonly known as a heart attack. This pain is secondary to [[ischemia]] of the cardiac tissue. The most common presenting symptom is [[chest pain]] that is often described as tightness, pressure or squeezing. The onset of symptoms is usually gradual, over several minutes and tends to be located in the central chest (overlying the [[sternum]]) although it can be experienced in the left chest, right chest, and even abdominal area. Associated symptoms, which are mostly autonomic in nature, include [[diaphoresis]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[palpitations]], and [[anxiety]] (which is often described as a sense of impending doom).&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, T (2010). "Myocardial Infarction". Focus on First Aid (15): 15. Retrieved 2010-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Heart Attack Warning Signs. Retrieved November 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Referred pain is experienced most commonly radiating down the left arm however it can also radiate to the lower [[jaw]], [[neck]], [[back]] and [[epigastrium]]. Some patients, especially [[elderly]] and [[diabetics]], may present with what is known as a painless myocardial infarction or a "silent heart attack". A painless MI can present with all of the associated symptoms of a heart attack, including nausea, vomiting, anxiety, heaviness, or choking, but the classic chest pain described above is lacking.&lt;ref name=twelve /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davis TM, Fortun P, Mulder J, Davis WA, Bruce DG | year = 2004 | title = Silent myocardial infarction and its prognosis in a community-based cohort of Type 2 diabetic patients: the Fremantle Diabetes Study | url = | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 395–9 | doi = 10.1007/s00125-004-1344-4 | pmid = 14963648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is always important for not only the physician but also the patient to remember the dissociation between magnitude of injury to internal organs and the intensity of pain and how this can be potentially dangerous if overlooked, for example a silent heart attack.&lt;ref name=main&gt;Carr, D.B. (2005). "Visceral Pain" International Association for the Study of Pain. VXIII, No.6&lt;/ref&gt; More rarely intense visceral pain does not signify a significant pathologic process, for example intense gas pains.

== Neurobiology ==

The vague and poorly defined sensation as well as its temporal nature, characteristic of visceral pain, is due to the low density of sensory innervation of [[viscera]] and the extensive divergence of visceral input within the [[central nervous system]] (CNS).&lt;ref name=twelve /&gt;&lt;ref name=fourteen /&gt;
The phenomenon of [[referred pain]] is secondary to the convergence of visceral [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent (sensory) nerve fibers]] entering the [[spinal cord]] at the same level as the superficial, [[Somatic nervous system|somatic]] structures experiencing the pain. This leads to a misinterpretation of incoming signals by higher brain centers.&lt;ref name=fourteen /&gt;&lt;ref name=fifteen /&gt;

== Treatment ==

There are two goals when treating visceral pain: to alleviate the current experience of pain and to address any underlying [[pathology]], if and when identifiable. Treatment of the pain in many circumstances should be deferred until the origin of the symptoms has been identified. Masking pain may confound the diagnostic process and delay the recognition of life-threatening conditions. Once a treatable condition has been identified there is no reason to withhold symptomatic treatment. Also, if cause for the pain is not found in reasonable time then symptomatic treatment of the pain could be of benefit to the patient in order to prevent long-term [[sensitization]] and provide immediate relief.&lt;ref name=thirteen /&gt;&lt;ref name=two&gt;Giamberardino MA. In: Devor M, et al. (Eds). Proceedings of the 9th World Congress on Pain, Progress in Pain Research and Management, Vol. 16. Seattle: IASP Press, 2000, pp 523–550.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fourtyseven&gt;Song SO, Carr DB. Pain: Clin Updates 1999; VII:1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptomatic treatment of visceral pain relies primarily upon [[pharmacotherapy]]. Since visceral pain can result secondary to a wide variety of causes, with or without associated pathology, a wide variety of pharmacological classes of drugs are used including a variety of [[analgesics]] (ex. [[opiates]], [[NSAIDs]], [[benzodiazepines]]), [[antispasmodics]] (ex. [[loperamide]]), [[antidepressants]] (ex. [[Tricyclic antidepressant|TCA]], [[SSRI]], [[SNRI]]) as well as others (ex. [[ketamine]], [[clonidine]], [[gabapentin]]). In addition, pharmacotherapy that targets the underlying cause of the pain can help alleviate symptoms due to lessening visceral nociceptive inputs.&lt;ref name=nine&gt;Loeser JD (Ed). Bonica's Management of Pain, 3rd ed, Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the use of [[nitrates]] can reduce [[Angina pectoris|anginal pain]] by dilating the [[coronary arteries]] and thus reducing the [[ischemia]] causing the pain. The use of spasmolytics (antispasmodics) can help alleviate pain from a gastrointestinal obstruction by inhibiting the contraction of the gut.&lt;ref name=twelve /&gt; There are issues associated with pharmacotherapy that include [[side effect]]s (ex. constipation associated with opiate use), [[chemical dependence]] or [[addiction]], and inadequate pain relief.

Invasive therapies are in general reserved for patients in whom pharmacological and other non-invasive therapies are ineffective. A wide variety of interventions are available and shown to be effective, a few will be discussed here. Approximately 50–80% of [[pelvic]] [[cancer]] pain patients benefit from [[nerve block]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Patt RB. Cancer pain. Philadelphia: JB Lippincott; 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodriquez-Bigas M, Petrelli NJ, Herrera L, West C. Intrathecal phenol rhizotomy for management of pain in recurrent unresectable carcinoma of the rectum. Surg Gynecol Obstet 1991;173:41–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Nerve blocks offer temporary relief and typically involve injection of a nerve bundle with either a [[local anesthetic]], a [[steroid]], or both. Permanent nerve block can be produced by destruction of nerve tissue. Strong evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials support the use of [[neurolytic]] [[celiac plexus]] block to alleviate pain and reduce opioid consumption in patients with [[malignant]] pain originating from abdominal viscera such as the [[pancreas]].&lt;ref&gt;54. Eisenberg E, et al. Pain: Clin Updates 2005; XIII:5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neurostimulation]], from a device such as a [[spinal cord stimulator]] (SCS), for refractory angina has been shown to be effective in several randomized controlled trials.&lt;ref&gt;Jessurun GA, et al. Eur J Pain 2003; 7(6):507–512.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diedrichs H, et al. Curr Control Trials Cardiovasc Med 2005; 6(1):7.&lt;/ref&gt; A SCS may also be used for other chronic pain conditions such as [[chronic pancreatitis]] and [[familial Mediterranean fever]]. Other devices that have shown benefit in reducing pain include [[Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation|transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators]] (TENS), targeted field stimulation, both used for somatic [[hyperalgesic]] states, external [[Neuromodulation (medicine)|neuromodulation]], [[pulsed radiofrequency|pulsed radiofrequency ablation]] and [[neuraxial blockade|neuraxial]] drug delivery systems.&lt;ref name=main /&gt;&lt;ref name=painreview&gt;Knowles C.H., Aziz Q, "Basic and clinical aspects of gastrointestinal pain" PAIN 141 (2009) 191–209&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''Vorlage''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfoːɐ̯laːɡə|}}; from the [[German language|German]] for ''prototype'' or ''template'') is a prior version or manifestation of a text under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Online: vorlage, n.
Second edition, 1989; online version December 2011. &lt;[http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/224679 http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/224679]&gt;; accessed 14 January 2012. First published in A Supplement to the OED IV, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  It may refer to such a version of a text itself, a particular [[manuscript]] of the text, or a more complex manifestation of the text (e.g., a group of copies, or a group of excerpts).&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Jonathan D. H., ''Contours in the Text'' (T&amp;T Clark International, 2011), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the original-language version of a text which a translator then works into a [[translation]] is called the ''Vorlage'' of that translation.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman &amp; Kuhlken, ''What are the Dead Sea scrolls and why do they matter?'' (Eerdmans, 2007), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Luther Bible]] is a translation of the [[Textus Receptus]]. So in this case the Textus Receptus is the ''Vorlage'' of the Luther Bible.  

Sometimes the ''Vorlage'' of a translation may be lost to history.  In some of these cases the ''Vorlage'' may be reconstructed from the translation.  Such a reconstructed ''Vorlage'' may be called a ''retroversion'', and it invariably is made with some amount of uncertainty.  Nevertheless, the ''Vorlage'' may still be reconstructed in some parts at such a level of confidence that the translation and its retroversion can be used as a witness for the purposes of [[textual criticism]].  This reconstructed ''Vorlage'' may stand on its own as the sole witness of the original-language text, or it may be compared and used along with other witnesses.  Thus, for example, scholars use the reconstructed ''Vorlage'' of the Greek [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] at parts to correct the Hebrew [[Masoretic text|Masoretic]] version when trying to determine oldest version of the Hebrew Bible that they can infer.&lt;ref&gt;Albrektson, B., "Masoretic or Mixed" in ''Text, Translation, Theology'' (Ashgate Publishing, 2010), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;  Or, as another example, the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] fragments of Plato's [[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]] included among the [[Nag Hammadi library]] are used to help attest to the original Greek text which Plato himself wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Slings, S. R., ''Platonis Rempublicam'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the bulk of the [[Gospel of Thomas]], the ''Vorlage'' exists only as a retroversion of the Coptic translation, as no other witness to the original Greek text for most of the sayings recorded therein is known.&lt;ref&gt;Plisch, Uwe-Karsten ''Das Thomasevangelium, Originaltext mit Kommentar''. (Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
