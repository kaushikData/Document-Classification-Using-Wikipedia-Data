'''1,2,4-Butanetriol trinitrate''' ('''BTTN'''), also called '''butanetriol trinitrate''', is an important military [[propellant]]. It is a colorless to brown explosive liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/1-2-4-Butanetriol-Analysis-Synthesis/dp/B00BVD8Q06|title=1,2,4-Butanetriol: Analysis and Synthesis|last=Pisacane|first=Frank J.|date=1982|publisher=PN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BTTN is used as a [[propellant]] in virtually all single-stage [[missile]]s used by the United States, including the [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3450853.stm|title=Bacteria help make missile fuel|date=2004-02-02|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is less volatile, less sensitive to shock, and more thermally stable than [[nitroglycerine]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=_fmGDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Chemistry and Technology of Solid Rocket Propellants (A Treatise on Solid Propellants)|last=Varghese|first=T.

'''''A Laboratory Manual for Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy''''' is a textbook written by [[Libbie Hyman]] in 1922 and released as the first edition from the [[University of Chicago]] press. It is also called and published simply as '''''Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy'''''. In 1942 Hyman released the second edition as a textbook, as well as a laboratory manual. It was referred to as her 'bread and butter', as she relied on its royalties for income. The ''Laboratory Manual for Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy'' still remains the same without revisions, and is used by universities around the world. In the book, she uses ''[[Balanoglossus]]'', ''[[Amphioxus]]'', [[sea squirt]], [[lamprey]], [[Skate (fish)|skate]], [[shark]], [[turtle]], [[alligator]], [[chicken]], and [[cat]] as specimens.

[[Image:Airplane vortex edit.jpg|300px|thumb|upright=1.6|A [[vortex]] is created by the passage of an aircraft wing, revealed by smoke. Vortices are one of the many phenomena associated with the study of aerodynamics.]]

'''Aerodynamics''', from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀήρ ''aer'' (air) + δυναμική (dynamics), is the study of the motion of [[air]], particularly its interaction with a solid object, such as an [[airplane]] wing. It is a sub-field of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[gas dynamics]], and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields.  The term ''aerodynamics'' is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, the difference being that "gas dynamics" applies to the study of the motion of all gases, and is not limited to air. 
The formal study of aerodynamics began in the modern sense in the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts such as [[aerodynamic drag]] were recorded much earlier.  Most of the early efforts in aerodynamics were directed toward achieving [[Aircraft#Heavier than air – aerodynes|heavier-than-air flight]], which was first demonstrated by [[Otto Lilienthal]] in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How the Stork Inspired Human Flight |url=http://www.flyingmag.com/how-stork-inspired-human-flight.html|publisher= flyingmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, the use of aerodynamics through [[mathematical]] analysis, empirical approximations, [[wind tunnel]] experimentation, and [[computer simulation]]s has formed a rational basis for the development of heavier-than-air flight and a number of other technologies.  Recent work in aerodynamics has focused on issues related to [[compressible flow]], [[turbulence]], and [[boundary layer]]s and has become increasingly [[Computational fluid dynamics|computational]] in nature.

==History==
{{main article|History of aerodynamics}}
Modern aerodynamics only dates back to the seventeenth century, but aerodynamic forces have been harnessed by humans for thousands of years in sailboats and windmills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wind Power's Beginnings (1000 BC – 1300 AD) Illustrated History of Wind Power Development |url=http://telosnet.com/wind/early.html|publisher= Telosnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and images and stories of flight appear throughout recorded history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Don |last=Berliner |year=1997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Efr2Ll1OdqMC&amp;pg=PA128 |title=Aviation: Reaching for the Sky |publisher= The Oliver Press, Inc. |page=128 |isbn= 1-881508-33-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Ancient Greek]] legend of [[Icarus]] and [[Daedalus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ovid |author2=Gregory, H. | title=The Metamorphoses | publisher=Signet Classics | year=2001 | isbn=0-451-52793-3 | oclc=45393471}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fundamental concepts of [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]], [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]], and [[pressure gradient]]s appear in the work of [[Aristotle]] and [[Archimedes]].&lt;ref name = "andersonhist"/&gt;

In 1726, [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] became the first person to develop a theory of air resistance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Newton, I. | title=Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, Book II | year=1726}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him one of the first aerodynamicists. [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-[[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[mathematician]] [[Daniel Bernoulli]] followed in 1738 with ''Hydrodynamica'' in which he described a fundamental relationship between pressure, density, and flow velocity for incompressible flow known today as [[Bernoulli's principle]], which provides one method for calculating aerodynamic lift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/658890/Hydrodynamica#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Hydrodynamica%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia | title= Hydrodynamica | accessdate=2008-10-30 |publisher= Britannica Online Encyclopedia }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1757, [[Leonhard Euler]] published the more general [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] which could be applied to both compressible and incompressible flows. The Euler equations were extended to incorporate the effects of viscosity in the first half of the 1800s, resulting in the [[Navier–Stokes equations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Navier, C. L. M. H. | title=Memoire sur les lois du mouvement des fluides | journal=Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences |volume=6|pages=389–440 | year=1827}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Stokes, G. | title=On the Theories of the Internal Friction of Fluids in Motion|url=https://archive.org/details/cbarchive_39179_onthetheoriesoftheinternalfric1849 | journal=Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |volume=8|pages=287–305 | year=1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Navier-Stokes equations are the most general governing equations of fluid flow and but are difficult to solve for the flow around all but the simplest of shapes.

[[Image:WB Wind Tunnel.jpg|thumb|A replica of the [[Wright brothers]]' [[wind tunnel]] is on display at the Virginia Air and Space Center. Wind tunnels were key in the development and validation of the laws of aerodynamics.]]

In 1799, [[George Cayley|Sir George Cayley]] became the first person to identify the four aerodynamic forces of flight ([[weight]], [[Lift (force)|lift]], [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]], and [[thrust]]), as well as the relationships between them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S Centennial of Flight Commission – Sir George Cayley. |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Prehistory/Cayley/PH2.htm |publisher= |accessdate=2008-09-10 |quote=Sir George Cayley, born in 1773, is sometimes called the Father of Aviation. A pioneer in his field, he was the first to identify the four aerodynamic forces of flight – weight, lift, drag, and thrust and their relationship. He was also the first to build a successful human-carrying glider. Cayley described many of the concepts and elements of the modern airplane and was the first to understand and explain in engineering terms the concepts of lift and thrust. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920052758/http://centennialofflight.gov/essay/Prehistory/Cayley/PH2.htm |archivedate=20 September 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AerNav123"&gt;''Cayley, George''.

In 1871, [[Francis Herbert Wenham]] constructed the first [[wind tunnel]], allowing precise measurements of aerodynamic forces.  Drag theories were developed by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=d'Alembert, J. | title=Essai d'une nouvelle theorie de la resistance des fluides | year=1752}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Kirchhoff]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kirchhoff, G. | title=Zur Theorie freier Flussigkeitsstrahlen | journal=Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik |volume=70|pages=289–298 | year=1869}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rayleigh, Lord | title=On the Resistance of Fluids | journal=Philosophical Magazine |volume=2| issue=13 |pages=430–441 |doi=10.1080/14786447608639132| year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, [[Charles Renard]], a French aeronautical engineer, became the first person to reasonably predict the power needed for sustained flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Renard, C. | title=Nouvelles experiences sur la resistance de l'air | journal=L'Aéronaute |volume=22|pages= 73–81 | year=1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Lilienthal]], the first person to become highly successful with glider flights, was also the first to propose thin, curved airfoils that would produce high lift and low drag.  Building on these developments as well as research carried out in their own wind tunnel, the [[Wright brothers]] flew the first powered airplane on December 17, 1903.

During the time of the first flights, [[Frederick W. Lanchester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lanchester, F. W. | title=Aerodynamics | year=1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Kutta]], and [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]] independently created theories that connected [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] of a fluid flow to lift. Kutta and Zhukovsky went on to develop a two-dimensional wing theory. Expanding upon the work of Lanchester, [[Ludwig Prandtl]] is credited with developing the mathematics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Prandtl, L. | title=Tragflügeltheorie | publisher=Göttinger Nachrichten, mathematischphysikalische Klasse, 451–477 | year=1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; behind thin-airfoil and lifting-line theories as well as work with [[boundary layer]]s.

As aircraft speed increased, designers began to encounter challenges associated with air [[compressibility]] at speeds near or greater than the speed of sound.  The differences in air flows under such conditions leds to problems in aircraft control, increased drag due to [[shock wave]]s, and the threat of structural failure due to [[Aeroelasticity|aeroelastic flutter]].  The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the [[Mach number]] after [[Ernst Mach]] who was one of the first to investigate the properties of [[supersonic]] flow. [[William John Macquorn Rankine]] and [[Pierre Henri Hugoniot]] independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a [[shock wave]], while [[Jakob Ackeret]] led the initial work of calculating the lift and drag of supersonic airfoils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ackeret, J. | title=Luftkrafte auf Flugel, die mit der grosserer als Schallgeschwindigkeit bewegt werden | journal=Zeitschrift für Flugtechnik und Motorluftschiffahrt |volume=16|pages=72–74 | year=1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodore von Kármán]] and [[Hugh Latimer Dryden]] introduced the term [[transonic]] to describe flow speeds around Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. This rapid increase in drag led aerodynamicists and aviators to disagree on whether supersonic flight was achievable until the [[sound barrier]] was broken for the first time in 1947 using the [[Bell X-1]] aircraft.

By the time the sound barrier was broken, aerodynamicists' understanding of the subsonic and low supersonic flow had matured. The [[Cold War]] prompted the design of an ever-evolving line of high performance aircraft. [[Computational fluid dynamics]] began as an effort to solve for flow properties around complex objects and has rapidly grown to the point where entire aircraft can be designed using computer software, with wind-tunnel tests followed by flight tests to confirm the computer predictions.  Understanding of [[supersonic]] and [[hypersonic]] aerodynamics has matured since the 1960s, and the goals of aerodynamicists have shifted from the behavior of fluid flow the engineering of a vehicle such that it interacts pedictably with the fluid flow. Designing aircraft for supersonic and hypersonic conditions, as well as the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems, continues to motivate new research in aerodynamics, while work continues to be done on important problems in basic aerodynamic theory related to flow turbulence and the existence and uniqueness of analytical solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.

==Fundamental concepts==
[[File:aeroforces.svg|thumb|Forces of flight on an [[airfoil]]]]
Understanding the motion of air around an object (often called a flow field)  enables the calculation of forces and [[Moment (physics)|moments]] acting on the object.  In many aerodynamics problems, the forces of interest are the fundamental forces of flight: [[Lift (force)|lift]], [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]], [[thrust]], and [[weight]].  Of these, lift and drag are aerodynamic forces, i.e. forces due to air flow over a solid body.  Calculation of these quantities is often founded upon the assumption that the flow field behaves as a continuum. Continuum flow fields are characterized by properties such as [[flow velocity]], [[pressure]], [[density]], and [[temperature]], which may be functions of position and time. These properties may be directly or indirectly measured in aerodynamics experiments or calculated starting with the equations for conservation of mass, [[momentum]], and energy in air flows.  Density, flow velocity, and an additional property, [[viscosity]], are used to classify flow fields. 

===Flow classification===
Flow velocity is used to classify flows according to speed regime. Subsonic flows are flow fields in which the air speed field is always below the local speed of sound. Transonic flows include both regions of subsonic flow and regions in which the local flow speed is greater than the local speed of sound. Supersonic flows are defined to be flows in which the flow speed is greater than the speed of sound everywhere. A fourth classification, hypersonic flow, refers to flows where the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound.  Aerodynamicists disagree on the precise definition of hypersonic flow.

[[Compressibility|Compressible flow]] accounts for varying density within the flow. Subsonic flows are often idealized as incompressible, i.e. the density is assumed to be constant. Transonic and supersonic flows are compressible, and calculations that neglect the changes of density in these flow fields will yield inaccurate results.

Viscosity is associated with the frictional forces in a flow. In some flow fields, viscous effects are very small, and approximate solutions may safely neglect viscous effects. These approximations are called inviscid flows. Flows for which viscosity is not neglected are called viscous flows. Finally, aerodynamic problems may also be classified by the flow environment. External aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes (e.g. around an airplane wing), while internal aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages inside solid objects (e.g. through a jet engine).

====Continuum assumption====
Unlike liquids and solids, gases are composed of discrete [[molecule]]s which occupy only a small fraction of the volume filled by the gas. On a molecular level, flow fields are made up of the collisions of many individual of gas molecules between themselves and with solid surfaces. However, in most aerodynamics applications, the discrete molecular nature of gases is ignored, and the flow field is assumed to behave as a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]]. This assumption allows fluid properties such as density and flow velocity to be defined everywhere within the flow.

The validity of the [[continuum assumption]] is dependent on the density of the gas and the application in question. For the continuum assumption to be valid, the [[mean free path]] length must be much smaller than the length scale of the application in question. For example, many aerodynamics applications deal with aircraft flying in atmospheric conditions, where the mean free path length is on the order of micrometers and where the body is orders of magnitude larger. In these cases, the length scale of the aircraft ranges from a few meters to a few tens of meters, which is much larger than the mean free path length. For such applications, the continuum assumption is reasonable. The continuum assumption is less valid for extremely low-density flows, such as those encountered by vehicles at very high altitudes (e.g. 300,000&amp;nbsp;ft/90&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;ref name = "andersonhist"&gt;{{cite book|last = Anderson|first = John David | title = A History of Aerodynamics and its Impact on Flying Machines| publisher = Cambridge University Press |year = 1997| location=New York, NY | isbn=0-521-45435-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or satellites in [[Low Earth orbit]]. In those cases, [[statistical mechanics]] is a more accurate method of solving the problem than is continuum aerodynamics. The [[Knudsen number]] can be used to guide the choice between statistical mechanics and the continuous formulation of aerodynamics.

===Conservation laws===
The assumption of  a [[Continuum mechanics|fluid continuum]] allows problems in aerodynamics to be solved using [[Fluid dynamics#Conservation laws|fluid dynamics conservation laws]]. Three conservation principles are used: 
# [[Conservation of mass]]: In fluid dynamics, the mathematical formulation of this principle is known as the [[Continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|mass continuity equation]], which requires that mass is neither created nor destroyed within a flow of interest.
# [[Conservation of momentum]]: In fluid dynamics, the mathematical formulation of this principle can be considered an application of [[Newton's Second Law]]. Momentum within a flow is only changed by the work performed on the system by external forces, which may include both [[surface force]]s, such as viscous ([[friction]]al) forces, and [[body force]]s, such as [[gravity|weight]].  The momentum conservation principle may be expressed as either a [[Vector space|vector]] equation or separated into a set of three [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] equations (x,y,z components). In its most complete form, the momentum conservation equations are known as the [[Navier-Stokes equations]].  The Navier-Stokes equations have no known analytical solution and are solved in modern aerodynamics using [[computational fluid dynamics|computational techniques]]. Because of the computational cost of solving these complex equations, simplified expressions of momentum conservation may be appropriate for specific applications. The [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] are a set of momentum conservation equations which neglect viscous forces and may be used in cases where the effect of viscous forces is expected to be small. Additionally, [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli's equation]] is a solution to the momentum conservation equation of an inviscid flow that neglects gravity.
# [[Conservation of energy]]: The energy conservation equation states that energy is neither created nor destroyed within a flow, and that any addition or subtraction of energy to a volume in the flow is caused by the fluid flow, by [[heat transfer]], or by [[Work (physics)|work]] into and out of the region of interest.

The [[ideal gas law]] or another such [[equation of state]] is often used in conjunction with these equations to form a determined system that allows the solution for the unknown variables.

==Branches of aerodynamics==
Aerodynamic problems are classified by the flow environment or properties of the flow, including [[flow speed]], [[compressibility]], and [[viscosity]]. ''External'' aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes. Evaluating the [[Lift (force)|lift]] and [[Drag (physics)|drag]] on an [[airplane]] or the [[shock wave]]s that form in front of the nose of a [[rocket]] are examples of external aerodynamics. ''Internal'' aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages in solid objects. For instance, internal aerodynamics encompasses the study of the airflow through a [[jet engine]] or through an [[air conditioning]] pipe.

Aerodynamic problems can also be classified according to whether the [[flow speed]] is below, near or above the [[speed of sound]]. A problem is called subsonic if all the speeds in the problem are less than the speed of sound, [[transonic]] if speeds both below and above the speed of sound are present (normally when the characteristic speed is approximately the speed of sound), [[supersonic]] when the characteristic flow speed is greater than the speed of sound, and [[hypersonic]] when the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound. Aerodynamicists disagree over the precise definition of hypersonic flow; a rough definition considers flows with [[Mach number]]s above 5 to be hypersonic.&lt;ref name = "andersonhist"/&gt;

The influence of [[viscosity]] on the flow dictates a third classification. Some problems may encounter only very small viscous effects, in which case viscosity can be considered to be negligible. The approximations to these problems are called [[inviscid flow]]s. Flows for which viscosity cannot be neglected are called viscous flows.

===Incompressible aerodynamics===
{{further information|incompressible flow}}
An incompressible flow is a flow in which density is constant in both time and space.  Although all real fluids are compressible, a flow is often approximated as incompressible if the effect of the density changes cause only small changes to the calculated results. This is more likely to be true when the flow speeds are significantly lower than the speed of sound. Effects of compressibility are more significant at speeds close to or above the speed of sound.  The [[Mach number]] is used to evaluate whether the incompressibility can be assumed, otherwise the effects of compressibility must be included.

====Subsonic flow====
Subsonic (or low-speed) aerodynamics describes fluid motion in flows which are much lower than the speed of sound everywhere in the flow. There are several branches of subsonic flow but one special case arises when the flow is [[inviscid]], [[Compressibility|incompressible]] and [[irrotational]]. This case is called [[potential flow]] and allows the [[differential equations]] that describe the flow to be a simplified version of the equations of [[fluid dynamics]], thus making available to the aerodynamicist a range of quick and easy solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Joseph|title=Low-speed aerodynamics: From wing theory to panel methods|series=McGraw-Hill series in aeronautical and aerospace engineering|year=1991|publisher=McGraw-Hill
|location=New York|isbn=0-07-050446-6|oclc=21593499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In solving a subsonic problem, one decision to be made by the aerodynamicist is whether to incorporate the effects of compressibility. Compressibility is a description of the amount of change of [[density]] in the flow. When the effects of compressibility on the solution are small, the assumption that density is constant may be made. The problem is then an incompressible low-speed aerodynamics problem. When the density is allowed to vary, the flow is called compressible. In air, compressibility effects are usually ignored when the [[Mach number]] in the flow does not exceed 0.3 (about 335 feet (102&amp;nbsp;m) per second or 228 miles (366&amp;nbsp;km) per hour at 60&amp;nbsp;°F (16&amp;nbsp;°C)). Above Mach 0.3, the problem flow should be described using compressible aerodynamics.

===Compressible aerodynamics===
{{main article|Compressible flow}}
According to the theory of aerodynamics, a flow is considered to be compressible if the [[density]] changes along a [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]]. This means that – unlike incompressible flow – changes in density are considered. In general, this is the case where the [[Mach number]] in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3. The Mach 0.3 value is rather arbitrary, but it is used because gas flows with a Mach number below that value demonstrate changes in density of less than 5%. Furthermore, that maximum 5% density change occurs at the [[stagnation point]] (the point on the object where flow speed is zero), while the density changes around the rest of the object will be significantly lower. Transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flows are all compressible flows.

====Transonic flow====
{{main article|Transonic}}
The term Transonic refers to a range of flow velocities just below and above the local [[speed of sound]] (generally taken as [[Mach Number|Mach]] 0.8–1.2). It is defined as the range of speeds between the [[critical mach|critical Mach number]], when some parts of the airflow over an aircraft become [[supersonic]], and a higher speed, typically near [[Mach number|Mach 1.2]], when all of the airflow is supersonic. Between these speeds, some of the airflow is supersonic, while some of the airflow is not supersonic.

{{anchor|Supersonic aerodynamics}}&lt;!-- anchor for the link that leads directly to the section --&gt;

====Supersonic flow====
{{main article|Supersonic}}
Supersonic aerodynamic problems are those involving flow speeds greater than the speed of sound. Calculating the lift on the [[Concorde]] during cruise can be an example of a supersonic aerodynamic problem.

Supersonic flow behaves very differently from subsonic flow. Fluids react to differences in pressure; pressure changes are how a fluid is "told" to respond to its environment. Therefore, since [[sound]] is in fact an infinitesimal pressure difference propagating through a fluid, the [[speed of sound]] in that fluid can be considered the fastest speed that "information" can travel in the flow. This difference most obviously manifests itself in the case of a fluid striking an object. In front of that object, the fluid builds up a [[stagnation pressure]] as impact with the object brings the moving fluid to rest. In fluid traveling at subsonic speed, this pressure disturbance can propagate upstream, changing the flow pattern ahead of the object and giving the impression that the fluid "knows" the object is there by seemingly adjusting its movement and is flowing around it. In a supersonic flow however, the pressure disturbance cannot propagate upstream. Thus, when the fluid finally reaches the object it strikes it and the fluid is forced to change its properties – [[temperature]], [[density]], [[pressure]], and [[Mach number]]—in an extremely violent and [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|irreversible]] fashion called a [[shock wave]]. The presence of shock waves, along with the compressibility effects of high-flow velocity (see [[Reynolds number]]) fluids, is the central difference between the supersonic and subsonic aerodynamics regimes.

====Hypersonic flow====
{{main article|Hypersonic}}
In aerodynamics, hypersonic speeds are speeds that are highly supersonic. In the 1970s, the term generally came to refer to speeds of Mach 5 (5 times the speed of sound) and above. The hypersonic regime is a subset of the supersonic regime. Hypersonic flow is characterized by high temperature flow behind a shock wave, viscous interaction, and chemical dissociation of gas.

==Associated terminology==
[[File:Types of flow analysis in fluid mechanics.svg|thumb|Different types flow analysis around an airfoil: 
  {{legend|#f3f3fd|[[Potential flow]] theory}}
  {{legend|#ff9665|[[Boundary layer|Boundary layer flow]] theory}}
  {{legend|#3b3bde|[[Turbulence|Turbulent wake]] analysis}}]]

The incompressible and compressible flow regimes produce many associated phenomena, such as boundary layers and turbulence.

===Boundary layers===
{{main article|Boundary layer}}
The concept of a [[boundary layer]] is important in many problems in aerodynamics. The viscosity and fluid friction in the air is approximated as being significant only in this thin layer. This assumption makes the description of such aerodynamics much more tractable mathematically.

===Turbulence===
{{main article|Turbulence}}
In aerodynamics, turbulence is characterized by chaotic property changes in the flow. These include low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and flow velocity in space and time. Flow that is not turbulent is called [[laminar flow]].

==Aerodynamics in other fields==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2018}}
===Engineering design===
{{Further information|Automotive aerodynamics}}
Aerodynamics is a significant factor in [[Automotive engineering|vehicle design]], including [[automobile]]s, and in the prediction of forces and moments acting on [[sailing|sailing vessels]]. It is used in the design of mechanical components such as [[hard drive]] heads. [[Structural engineering|Structural engineers]] resort to aerodynamics, and particularly [[aeroelasticity]], when calculating [[wind]] loads in the design of large buildings, [[bridge]]s, and [[Wind turbine design|wind turbines]] 

The aerodynamics of internal passages is important in [[HVAC|heating/ventilation]], [[Duct (HVAC)|gas piping]], and in [[Internal combustion engine|automotive engines]] where detailed flow patterns strongly affect the performance of the engine.

===Environmental design===
Urban aerodynamics are studied by [[Urban planning|town planners]] and designers seeking to improve [[amenity]] in outdoor spaces, or in creating urban microclimates to reduce the effects of urban pollution. The field of environmental aerodynamics describes ways in which [[atmospheric circulation]] and flight mechanics affect ecosystems. 

Aerodynamic equations are used in [[numerical weather prediction]].

===Ball-control in sports===
Sports in which aerodynamics are of crucial importance include [[Association football|soccer]], [[cricket]] and golf, in which control over the trajectory of ball movement is sought by expert players who can, for instance, exploit the "[[Magnus effect#In sport|Magnus effect]]" and other environmental conditions to advantage.

'''Aeroflot Flight 4225''' was a [[Tupolev Tu-154|Tupolev Tu-154B-2]] that was a domestic scheduled passenger flight from [[Almaty International Airport|Alma-Ata Airport]] (now Almaty) in [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Kazakhstan]] to [[Simferopol Airport]] in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]] on July 8, 1980. The aircraft reached an altitude of no more than 500 feet when the airspeed suddenly dropped because of thermal currents it encountered during the climb out, causing the airplane to stall before traveling 5&amp;nbsp;km (3.1&amp;nbsp;mi) away, crash and catch fire, killing all 156 passengers and 10 crew on board.&lt;ref name=asn&gt;{{cite web|title=ASN Aircraft accident Tupolev 154B-2 CCCP-85355 Alma-Ata Airport (ALA)|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19800708-0|publisher=Aviation Safety Network|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To date, it remains the deadliest aviation accident in Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name="asn" /&gt;

==Accident==
At the time of the accident [[Alma-Ata]] was experiencing a [[heat wave]]. It was around 00:39 and Flight 4225 took off from Alma-Ata Airport in Soviet Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name=asn /&gt; Only a few seconds after take off, the flight reached 500 feet. The weather was not on the flight's side; the plane reached a zone of hot air and then the Soviet aircraft's [[airspeed]] dramatically dropped and the plane was caught in a big [[downdraft]]. The Tupolev [[Stall (engine)|stalled]] and plummeted, nose down, into a farm near the suburbs of Alma-Ata. It slid into a ravine, caught fire and disintegrated, killing everyone on board.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airdisaster.ru/database.php?id=34|title=Катастрофа Ту-154Б-2 Алма-Атинского ОАО в районе а/п Алма-Ата|last=|first=|date=|website=www.airdisaster.ru|language=ru|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://russianplanes.net/reginfo/7932|title=Туполев Ту-154Б-2 Бортовой №: СССР-85355|last=|first=|date=|website=russianplanes.net|language=ru|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
The Soviet aviation board concluded that the crash was caused by [[windshear]] which took place while the aircraft was near its maximum takeoff weight for the local conditions which included mountains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aviation Disasters Second Edition |last1=Gero |first1=David |publisher=Patrick Stephens Limited |year= 1996 |page=164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also include [[copper]], and sometimes [[titanium]]. Alnico alloys are [[ferromagnetic]], with a high [[coercivity]] (resistance to loss of magnetism) and are used to make [[permanent magnet]]s. Before the development of [[rare-earth magnet]]s in the 1970s, they were the strongest type of permanent magnet. Other trade names for alloys in this family are: ''Alni, Alcomax, Hycomax, Columax'', and ''Ticonal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The composition of alnico alloys is typically 8–12% Al, 15–26% Ni, 5–24% Co, up to 6% Cu, up to 1% Ti, and the balance is Fe. The development of alnico began in 1931, when T. Mishima in Japan discovered that an alloy of iron, nickel, and aluminum had a coercivity of 
400 [[oersted]]s (Oe; 0.07957 kA/m), double that of the best magnet steels of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Properties==
Alnico alloys can be magnetised to produce strong [[magnetic field]]s and have a high coercivity (resistance to demagnetization), thus making strong permanent magnets. Of the more commonly available magnets, only [[rare-earth magnet]]s such as [[neodymium magnet|neodymium]] and [[samarium-cobalt magnet|samarium-cobalt]] are stronger. Alnico magnets produce magnetic field strength at their poles as high as 1500&amp;nbsp;[[Gauss (unit)|gauss]]es (0.15&amp;nbsp;[[Tesla (unit)|tesla]]s), or about 3000 times the strength of [[Earth's magnetic field]]. Some brands of alnico are [[isotropic]] and can be efficiently magnetized in any direction. Other types, such as alnico 5 and alnico 8, are anisotropic, with each having a preferred direction of [[magnetization]], or orientation. Anisotropic alloys generally have greater magnetic capacity in a preferred orientation than isotropic types. Alnico's [[remanence]] ('''B'''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) may exceed 12,000&amp;nbsp;[[Gauss (unit)|G]] (1.2&amp;nbsp;[[Tesla (unit)|T]]), its coercivity ('''H'''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) can be up to 1000&amp;nbsp;oersteds (80&amp;nbsp;kA/m), its energy product (('''BH''')&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) can be up to 5.5&amp;nbsp;MG·Oe (44&amp;nbsp;T·A/m). This means that alnico can produce a strong magnetic flux in closed magnetic circuits, but has relatively small resistance against demagnetization. The field strength at the poles of any permanent magnet depends very much on the shape and is usually well below the remanence strength of the material.

Alnico alloys have some of the highest [[Curie temperature]]s of any magnetic material, around {{convert|800|C|F|abbr=on}}, although the maximal working temperature is normally limited to around {{convert|538|C|F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arnoldmagnetics.com/products/alnico-magnets/ Arnold-Alnico Magnets]. Arnoldmagnetics.com. Retrieved on 2011-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt; They are the only magnets that have useful magnetism even when heated [[Incandescence|red-hot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

They are also one of the most stable magnets if they are handled properly. Alnico magnets are electrically conductive, unlike ceramic magnets.

==Classification==
Alnico magnets are traditionally classified using numbers assigned by the Magnetic Materials Producers Association (MMPA), for example, alnico 3 or alnico 5. These classifications indicate chemical composition and magnetic properties. (The classification numbers themselves do not have any direct relation to the properties of the magnet; for instance, a higher number does not necessarily indicate a stronger magnet.)&lt;ref name="mmpa0100-00"&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard Specifications for Permanent Magnet Materials (MMPA Standard No. 0100-00)|url=http://www.allianceorg.com/pdfs/MMPA_0100-00.pdf|publisher=Magnetic Materials Producers Association|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These classification numbers, while still in use, have been deprecated in favor of a new system by the MMPA, which designates Alnico magnets based on [[Oersted#Stored_energy|maximum energy product]] in megagauss-oersteds and [[Coercivity|intrinsic coercive force]] as kilooersteds, as well as an IEC classification system.&lt;ref name="mmpa0100-00" /&gt;

==Manufacturing process==
[[Image:Jensen ad for Alnico 5 speakers.jpg|thumb|Advertisement by Jensen Radio Manufacturing Co. for Alnico 5 [[loudspeaker]]s in 1945. As illustrated, Alnico 5 allowed a dramatic reduction in size and weight of magnet needed to produce a given flux, from 90 oz in 1930 to 4.6 oz.]]
Alnico magnets are produced by [[casting (metalworking)|casting]] or [[sintering]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Peter|title=Permanent magnet materials and their application |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |location=UK|pages=35–38 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_HYiPeL1hrwC&amp;pg=PA35 |isbn=978-0-521-56688-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anisotropic alnico magnets are oriented by heating above a critical temperature and cooling in the presence of a magnetic field. Both isotropic and anisotropic alnico require proper heat treatment to develop optimal magnetic properties—without it alnico's coercivity is about 10&amp;nbsp;Oe, comparable to technical iron, which is a soft magnetic material. After the heat treatment alnico becomes a composite material, named "[[precipitation hardening|precipitation]] material"—it consists of iron- and cobalt-rich&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evolution of Fe-Co rich particles in Alnico 8 alloy thermomagnetically treated at 800&amp;nbsp;°C |journal=Materials Science and Technology |doi=10.1179/026708300101508810 |year=2000 |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=1023–1028|last1=Chu |first1=W.G |last2=Fei |first2=W.D |last3=Li |first3=X.H |last4=Yang |first4=D.Z |last5=Wang |first5=J.L }}&lt;/ref&gt; precipitates in rich-NiAl matrix.[[Image:Alnico magnet assortment.jpg|thumb|Assortment of Alnico magnets in 1956. Alnico 5, developed during World War 2, led to a new generation of compact permanent magnet motors and loudspeakers.]]Alnico's anisotropy is oriented along the desired magnetic axis by applying an external magnetic field to it during the precipitate particle nucleation, which occurs when cooling from {{convert|900|C|F|abbr=on}} to {{convert|800|C|F|abbr=on}}, near the [[Curie point]]. Without an external field there are local anisotropies of different orientations due to spontaneous magnetization. The precipitate structure is a "barrier" against magnetization changes, as it prefers few magnetization states requiring much energy to get the material into any intermediate state. Also, a weak magnetic field shifts the magnetization of the matrix phase only and is reversible.

==Uses==
[[File:CowMagnet.jpg|thumb|Alnico [[cow magnet]], used to bind sharp iron wire and other iron objects that may be ingested by the animal and otherwise cause damage to the digestive tract]]

Alnico magnets are widely used in industrial and consumer applications where strong permanent magnets are needed; examples are [[electric motor]]s, electric [[guitar pickup]]s, [[microphones]], [[sensor]]s, [[loudspeaker]]s, [[magnetron]] tubes, and [[cow magnet]]s. In many applications they are being superseded by [[rare-earth magnet]]s, whose stronger fields (B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) and larger energy products (BH&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) allow smaller-size magnets to be used for a given application.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1664">'''Annihilation radiation''' is a term used in [[Gamma spectroscopy]] for the gamma radiation produced when a [[elementary particle|particle]] and its [[antiparticle]] collide and [[Annihilation|annihilate]].  Most commonly, this refers to 511-k[[Electronvolt|eV]] gamma rays produced by a normal (negative) [[electron]] colliding with a [[positron]].&lt;ref&gt;Charlton M and Humberston JW. ''Positron Physics''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Annihilation Radiation.JPG|thumb|A Germanium detector spectrum showing the annihilation radiation peak (under the arrow). Note the width of the peak compared to the other gamma rays visible in the spectrum.]]

Annihilation radiation is not monoenergetic, unlike [[gamma ray]]s produced by [[radioactive decay]].  The production mechanism of annihilation radiation introduces [[Doppler broadening]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerard F. Gilmore|Gilmore, G.]], and Hemmingway, J.: "Practical Gamma Ray Spectrometry", page 13. John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  The annihilation peak produced in a gamma spectrum by annihilation radiation therefore has a higher [[full width at half maximum]] (FWHM) than other gamma rays in spectrum.  The difference is more apparent with high resolution detectors, such as [[Germanium]] detectors, than with low resolution detectors such as [[Sodium iodide]] detectors.

Because of their well-defined energy (511 keV) and characteristic, Doppler-broadened shape, annihilation radiation can often be useful in defining the energy calibration of a gamma ray spectrum.

[[File:Kevlar chemical structure.png|thumb|400px|Structure of [[Twaron]] and [[Kevlar]], both [[Para- (chemistry)|''para'']]-aramid ]]
'''Aramid''' fibers are a class of heat-resistant and strong [[synthetic fiber]]s.  They are used in aerospace and military applications, for ballistic-rated [[bulletproof vest|body armor]] [[cloth|fabric]] and ballistic composites, in bicycle tires, [[marine cordage]], [[marine hull]] reinforcement, and as an [[asbestos]] substitute.&lt;ref name=Hillermeier&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/004051758405400903  |title= Prospects of Aramid as a Substitute for Asbestos |author=Hillermeier, Karlheinz |pages=575–580 |journal= Textile Research Journal |volume= 54 |issue= 9 |date=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name is a [[portmanteau]] of "[[aromatic]] [[polyamide]]".  The chain molecules in the fibers are highly oriented along the fiber axis. As a result, a higher proportion of the [[chemical bond]] contributes more to fiber strength than in many other synthetic fibers. Aramides have a very high melting point (&gt;500 °C)

==History==
Aromatic polyamides were first introduced in commercial applications in the early 1960s, with a [[meta- (chemistry)|meta]]-aramid fiber produced by [[DuPont]] as HT-1 and then under the trade name [[Nomex]].&lt;ref name=Kent&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Industrial Chemistry and Biotechnology |editor=James A. Kent |page=483 |publisher=Springer |date=2006 |isbn=0-387-27842-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fiber, which handles similarly to normal textile apparel fibers, is characterized by its excellent resistance to heat, as it neither melts nor ignites in normal levels of oxygen. It is used extensively in the production of protective apparel, air filtration, thermal and electrical insulation, as well as a substitute for [[asbestos]]. Meta-aramid is also produced in the Netherlands and Japan by [[Teijin Aramid]] under the trade name '''Teijinconex,'''&lt;ref name=Kent /&gt; in Korea by [[Toray]] under the trade name '''Arawin,''' in China by Yantai Tayho under the trade name '''New Star,''' by SRO Group (China) under the trade name '''[[X-Fiper]],''' and a variant of meta-aramid in France by Kermel under the trade name '''Kermel.'''

Based on earlier research by [[Monsanto Company]] and [[Bayer]], [[para- (chemistry)|para]]-aramid fiber with much higher [[tensile strength|tenacity]] and [[elastic modulus]] was also developed in the 1960s and 1970s by DuPont and [[AkzoNobel]], both profiting from their knowledge of [[rayon]], [[polyester]] and [[nylon]] processing.

In 1973 DuPont was the first company to introduce a para-aramid fiber, which it called [[Kevlar]], to the market; this remains one of the best-known para-aramids and/or aramids. In 1978, Akzo introduced a similar fiber with roughly the same chemical structure, which it called [[Twaron]]. Due to earlier patents on the production process, Akzo and DuPont engaged in a patent dispute in the 1980s. Twaron subsequently came under the ownership of the [[Teijin Aramid|Teijin]] Company. (See [[#Production|Production]].)

Para-aramids are used in many high-tech applications, such as aerospace and military applications, for "bullet-proof" [[bulletproof vest|body armor]] [[cloth|fabric]].

The [[Federal Trade Commission]] definition for aramid fiber is:{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A manufactured fiber in which the fiber-forming substance is a long-chain synthetic polyamide in which at least 85% of the [[peptide bond|amide linkages, (−CO−NH−)]] are attached directly to two aromatic rings.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Health==
During the 1990s, an ''[[in vitro]]'' test of aramid fibers showed they exhibited "many of the same effects on [[epithelial cell]]s as did [[asbestos]], including increased [[radiolabel]]ed [[nucleotide]] incorporation into DNA and induction of ODC ([[ornithine decarboxylase]]) enzyme activity", raising the possibility of [[carcinogenic]] implications.&lt;ref name=toxicology-effects&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsh|first=J.

==Production==
World capacity of para-aramid production was estimated at about 41,000 [[tonne]]s per year in 2002 and increases each year by 5–10%.&lt;ref name=capacity&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11268&amp;page=34 |title=High-Performance Structural Fibers for Advanced Polymer Matrix Composites |date=2005|isbn=0-309-09614-6|author=Committee on High-Performance Structural Fibers for Advanced Polymer Matrix Composites, National Research Council |publisher=[[The National Academies Press]] |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 this means a total production capacity of around 55,000 tonnes per year.

===Polymer preparation===
Aramids are generally prepared by the reaction between an [[amine]] group and a [[carboxylic acid]] [[halide]] group.  Simple AB [[homopolymer]]s may look like
:''n'' NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−Ar−COCl → −(NH−Ar−CO)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;− + ''n'' HCl

The most well-known aramids ([[Kevlar]], [[Twaron]], [[Nomex]], New Star and Teijinconex) are AABB polymers.  Nomex, Teijinconex and New Star  contain predominantly the meta-linkage and are poly-''metaphenylene isophthalamide''s (MPIA).
Kevlar and Twaron are both ''p''-phenylene terephthalamides (PPTA), the simplest form of the AABB para-polyaramide.  PPTA is a product of ''p''-phenylene diamine ([[P-Phenylenediamine|PPD]]) and [[Terephthaloyl chloride|terephthaloyl dichloride (TDC or TCl)]].

Production of PPTA relies on a [[co-solvent]] with an [[ion]]ic component ([[calcium chloride]] (CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)) to occupy the [[hydrogen bond]]s of the amide groups, and an organic component ([[Methylpyrrolidone|N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP)]]) to dissolve the [[aromatic]] [[polymer]].  This process was invented by Leo Vollbracht, who worked at the Dutch chemical firm Akzo. Apart from the [[carcinogenic]] Hexamethylphosphorous Triamide ([[Hexamethylphosphoramide|HMPT]]), still no practical alternative of dissolving the polymer is known. 
The use of the NMP/CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system led to an extended patent dispute between Akzo and DuPont.

===Spinning===
After production of the polymer, the aramid fiber is produced by [[spinneret (polymers)|spinning]] the dissolved polymer to a [[solid]] fiber from a [[liquid]] chemical blend.  Polymer solvent for spinning PPTA is generally 100% [[anhydrous]] [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Other types of aramids==

Besides meta-aramids like Nomex, other variations belong to the aramid fiber range.  These are mainly of the '''copolyamide''' type, best known under the brand name [[Technora]], as developed by [[Teijin]] and introduced in 1976.  The manufacturing process of Technora reacts [[P-Phenylenediamine|PPD]] and 3,4'-diaminodiphenylether (3,4'-ODA) with [[Terephthaloyl chloride|terephthaloyl chloride (TCl)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Ozawa S |title=A New Approach to High Modulus, High Tenacity Fibers| journal= Polym. J. Japan | date= 1987| volume= 19 | page= 199| doi=10.1295/polymj.19.119|url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/polymj/19/1/19_119/_article }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This relatively simple process uses only one amide solvent, and therefore spinning can be done directly after the polymer production.

==Aramid fiber characteristics==
Aramids share a high degree of orientation with other fibers such as [[ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]], a characteristic that dominates their properties.

===General===
* good resistance to [[Wear#Abrasive wear|abrasion]]
* good resistance to organic solvents
* nonconductive
* no [[melting point]]
* low flammability
* good fabric integrity at elevated [[temperature]]s
* sensitive to acids and salts
* sensitive to [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]]
* prone to electrostatic charge build-up unless finished&lt;ref name=textiles/&gt;

===Para-aramids===
* para-aramid fibers, such as Kevlar and Twaron, provide outstanding strength-to-weight properties
* high [[Chord modulus]]
* high [[tensile strength|tenacity]]
* low [[Creep (deformation)|creep]]
* low elongation at break (~3.5%)
* difficult to dye – usually [[Wet processing engineering#Solution dyeing|solution-dyed]]&lt;ref name=textiles&gt;{{cite book |author= Kadolph, Sara J. Anna L. Langford| title= Textiles| journal= Pearson Education, Inc. Upper Saddle River, NJ| date= 2002}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Market ==
The largest section for the use of aramid fiber is for security and protection (including military applications, private security, Municipal law enforcement and private contractors). The Major market since 2015 is Europe, especially Germany, France and the United Kingdom. The Asia-Pacific region like Japan and China is the second largest with major companies using aramid fiber. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.openpr.com/wiki/aramid-fiber-market|title=The geography of the aramid fiber market|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Association [[Negawatt power|NegaWatt]]''' Power, Is a French advocacy group based in [[Valence, Drôme]]. It was founded in 2001 to promote the [[Negawatt power|NegaWatt]] concept and its application to French society. The association seeks to reduce the use and consumption of [[fossil fuel]]s and [[nuclear power]].&lt;ref&gt;Le Figaro, 29 September 2011, [http://www.lefigaro.fr/conjoncture/2011/09/29/04016-20110929ARTFIG00783-sortie-du-nucleaire-en-2033-un-scenario-qui-bouscule.php Nuclear phase-out] Le Figaro&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Les Echos, 29 September 2009 - [http://www.lesechos.fr/entreprises-secteurs/energie-environnement/actu/0201666137010-une-association-juge-techniquement-possible-une-sortie-de-l-atome-des-2034-225877.php A French organization thinks it is possible to phase out nuclear energy] Les Echos&lt;/ref&gt; Its approach is based on [[energy conservation]], [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and the use of [[renewable energies]]. It published a scenario that details a path to phasing out these energy sources.

The association unites energy specialists in France, relying mostly on volunteer engineers. Other specialists include volunteer [[sociologists]], [[economists]] and [[urban planners]], who work together to create [[energy transition]] scenarios and to suggest the corresponding political steps that would need to be taken.

Association NégaWatt inspired local initiatives in transition towns called "Virage-Energie," meaning "energy bend."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virage-energie-npdc.org/ Virage-énergie Nord-Pas-de-Calais]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virageenergieclimatpdl.org/ Virage Énergie Climat Pays de la Loire]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://virage-energie-idf.org/ Virage-énergie Île-de-France]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://veaquitaine.wordpress.com/ Virage-énergie Aquitaine]&lt;/ref&gt;

== NégaWatt scenario ==

The NégaWatt scenario spans from 2012 to 2050. The scenario starts by assessing energy needs in terms of [[heat]], [[Transport|mobility]] and specific electricity, and suggests a transition path. It then couples the NégaWatt and the Afterterres 2050 scenarios. The [[:fr:Afterres2050|Afterres]] association targets [[agriculture]] energy use and can evaluate biomass production, providing the NégaWatt scenario with realistic [[biomass]] figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/-La-transition-energetique-pour-la- Energy transition] website of the French ministry of environment&lt;/ref&gt;

An English version of the scenario is available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120310141305/http://www.negawatt.org/telechargement/SnW11//Scenario_negaWatt_2011_Presentation_Anglais.pdf négaWatt scenario in English]&lt;/ref&gt;

The scenario employs the [[power to gas]] process to compensate for the intermittent nature of most renewable energies. The equilibrium of the electricity network is guaranteed with a maximal time step of one hour. The scenario concluded that already-proven technologies are available to effect the transition.

== Other countries ==
A Swiss NégaWatt organization was founded in 2014, on the basis of the French one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ch.negawatt.org/?page_id=10&amp;lang=fr Swiss organization] (in French and German)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''biocenosis''' (UK English, ''bioc'''o'''enosis'', also '''biocenose''', '''biocoenose''', '''biotic community''', '''biological community''', '''[[Community (ecology)|ecological community]]''', '''life assemblage,''') coined by [[Karl Möbius]] in 1877, describes the interacting [[organism]]s living together in a [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] ([[biotope]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Möbius|Möbius, Karl]]. 1877. ''Die Auster und die Austernwirtschaft.'' Verlag von Wiegandt, Hemple &amp; Parey: Berlin, [https://archive.org/details/dieausterunddie00mbgoog]. (English translation: The Oyster and Oyster Farming. ''U.S. Commission Fish and Fisheries Report'', 1880: 683-751, [http://penbay.org/cof/cof_1880.html].)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the palaeontological literature, the term distinguishes "life assemblages", which reflect the original living community, living together at one place and time. In other words, it is an assemblage of fossils or a community of specific time, which is different from "death assemblages" ([[Thanatocoenosis|thanatocoenoses]]).&lt;ref name=Ager&gt;e.g. Ager, 1963, Principles of Palaeoecology&lt;/ref&gt;  No palaeontological assemblage will ever completely represent the original biological community (i.e. the biocoenosis, in the sense used by an ecologist); the term thus has somewhat different meanings in a palaeontological and an ecological context.&lt;ref name="Ager"/&gt;

Based on the concept of biocenosis, ecological communities can take in various forms
*Zoocenosis for the [[fauna]]l community,
*[[Phytocenosis]] for the [[flora]] community,
*Microbiocenosis for the [[microbe|microbial]] community.

The [[geography|geographical]] extent of a biocenose is limited by the requirement of a more or less uniform species composition.

==Ecosystems==
{{main|Ecosystem}}
An [[ecosystem]], originally defined by Tansley (1935), is a biotic community (or biocenosis) along with its physical environment (or ''[[biotope]]''). In ecological studies, biocenosis is the emphasis on relationships between species in an area. These relationships are an additional consideration to the interaction of each species with the physical environment.

==Biotic communities==
[[Image:Tide pools in santa cruz.jpg|thumb|The side of a [[tide pool]] showing [[sea star]]s (''Dermasterias''), [[sea anemone]]s (''[[Anthopleura]]'') and [[sea sponge]]s in Santa Cruz, California.]]
Biotic communities vary in size, and larger ones may contain smaller ones. Species interactions are evident in food or feeding relationships. A method of delineating biotic communities is to map the [[food chain|food network]] to identify which species feed upon which others and then determine the system boundary as the one that can be drawn through the fewest consumption links relative to the number of species within the boundary.

Mapping biotic communities is important identifying sites needing environmental protection, such as the British [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs).  The [[Australia]]n [[Department of the Environment and Heritage (Australia)|Department of the Environment and Heritage]] maintains a register of ''Threatened Species and Threatened Ecological Communities'' under the [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]] (EPBC Act).

'''Bjørn Skogstad Aamo''' (born 21 January 1946) is a Norwegian [[economist]] and [[politician]] for the [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour Party]]. He was [[State Secretary#Norway|State Secretary]] for three non-consecutive terms between 1973 and 1993, and served as Director of the [[Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway]] from 1993 to 2011.

==Career==
===Political career===
Born in [[Oslo]],&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Aamo, Bjørn Skogstad |encyclopedia=Aschehoug og Gyldendals Store norske leksikon |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location= |url=http://www.snl.no/article.html?id=811613 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aamo grew up in [[Mandal, Norway|Mandal]]. He became involved in politics at an early age, and was appointed chairman of the local [[Workers' Youth League (Norway)|Workers' Youth League]] chapter in 1962. He then moved back to the capital to enroll at the [[University of Oslo]]. He became chairman of the Workers' Youth League chapter there. Situated on the left wing of the organization, he became a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] as well as the Norwegian [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] membership, much to the dismay of party secretary [[Haakon Lie]]. However, Aamo found support from fellow economist [[Per Kleppe]],&lt;ref name=aamo&gt;{{Cite news|first=Helge |last=Røed |title=En viktig nasjonal strateg |work=Fædrelandsvennen |date=21 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at that time a deputy member of the party central committee and head of the [[think tank]] ''Arbeiderbevegelsens utredningskontor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{stortingetbio|PEKL|name=Per Kleppe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aamo graduated with the degree [[cand.oecon.]] in [[economics]] in 1970, and from 1971 to 1972 he worked as personal secretary (today known as political adviser) in the [[Norwegian Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development|Ministry of Local Government and Labour]]. He was then promoted to [[State Secretary (Norway)|State Secretary]] in the [[Norwegian Ministry of Finance|Ministry of Finance]] from 1973 to 1979, serving under Per Kleppe who had become [[Minister of Finance (Norway)|Minister of Finance]].&lt;ref name=aamo-2&gt;{{Cite news|agency=Norwegian News Agency |title=60 år 21. januar: Kredittilsynsdirektør Bjørn Skogstad Aamo |date=30 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was then head of the department of economics in the [[European Free Trade Association]] from 1979 to 1981, and director{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} of the [[Regional Development Fund]] from 1981 to 1986. He then returned as State Secretary from 1986 to 1989 under Minister of Finance [[Gunnar Berge]] in [[Brundtland's Second Cabinet]]. He lost his job when Brundtland's Second Cabinet fell in 1989, and briefly returned to Regional Development Fund. In 1990 as the short-lived [[Syse's Cabinet]] fell and [[Brundtland's Third Cabinet]] assumed office, Aamo was appointed State Secretary at the [[Norwegian Office of the Prime Minister|Office of the Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name="aamo-2"/&gt;

===Financial Supervisory Authority===
In 1993 he was appointed Director of the [[Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway|Financial Supervisory Authority]], succeeding [[Svein Aasmundstad]]. This decision was criticized by the political opposition.&lt;ref name=negative&gt;{{Cite news|first=Line Noer |last=Borrevik |title=Skogstad Aamo ikke ønsket av politikerne |work=Dagens Næringsliv |date=5 March 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aamo belonged to the same political party as [[Minister of Finance (Norway)|Minister of Finance]] [[Sigbjørn Johnsen]] and the rest of Brundtland's Third Cabinet. Since Aamo came directly from a government position, that of state secretary, parliament member [[Lars Gunnar Lie]] cited concern about a perceived lack of distance between the third cabinet Brundtland and the Financial Supervisory Authority. This would put the independence of the latter at odds, he claimed. However, most of the criticism was directed at Sigbjørn Johnsen, who at that time was under scrutiny for his involvement with private corporation [[Storebrand|UNI Storebrand]]. The Financial Supervisory Authority would have a role in this scrutiny, and several people, including parliament member [[Kristin Halvorsen]], asked for the appointment of Johnsen's party fellow be postponed until after the case was closed. Parliament member [[Carl I. Hagen]] called for Johnsen to resign.&lt;ref name="negative"/&gt; On the other hand, conservative newspaper ''[[Aftenposten]]'' defended the decision in an op-ed the next day, citing Aamo's strong qualifications for the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= |last= |title=Omstridt, men vel kvalifisert |work=Aftenposten |date=6 March 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism did not hinder the appointment of Aamo, and Sigbjørn Johnsen remained in his seat.

Aamo applied for the position as [[Norges Bank#List of Central Bank Governors|Governor]] of the [[Norges Bank|Central Bank of Norway]] in 1999, but [[Svein Gjedrem]] was appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|agency=Norwegian News Agency |title=Jakt på Statoil-sjef og Børs-sjef |url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=7149736 |date=9 August 1999 |accessdate=12 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[economic crisis of 2008]], Aamo stated that banks are safer in Norway than in any other country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= |title=Vil ha kraftigere lut |url=http://www.orapp.no/bors_og_aksjetips/20081010/vil_ha_kraftigere_lut/ |work=Økonomisk Rapport |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014055816/http://www.orapp.no/bors_og_aksjetips/20081010/vil_ha_kraftigere_lut/ |archivedate=14 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The matters are complicated by Norway's close relations to Iceland, whose [[2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis|national crisis]] had consequences for Norwegian customers in the banks [[Glitnir Bank|Glitnir]] and [[Kaupthing Bank|Kaupthing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= |title=Redder norske sparepenger i islandske krisebanker |url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/innenriks/926521/Redder_norske_sparepenger__i_islandske_krisebanker.html |work=Stavanger Aftenblad |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011074644/http://www.aftenbladet.no/innenriks/926521/Redder_norske_sparepenger__i_islandske_krisebanker.html |archivedate=11 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aamo is himself a board member of the [[Norwegian Banks' Guarantee Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankenessikringsfond.no/no/hoved/om-oss/styre/|title=Styre|date=|publisher=Norwegian Banks' Guarantee Fund|language=Norwegian|accessdate=20 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218230817/http://www.bankenessikringsfond.no/no/hoved/om-oss/styre/|archive-date=18 December 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dunedin recycling bins 2008.jpg|thumb|Blue box recycling bins]]

The '''blue box recycling system''' (BBRS) was initially a [[waste management]] system used by [[Canada|Canadian]] municipalities to collect source separated [[Municipal solid waste|household waste]] materials for the purpose of recycling. The first full-scale community wide BBRS was implemented in 1983 by the waste management contractor Ontario Total Recycling Systems Ltd. (a subsidiary of [[Laidlaw]] Waste Systems) for the [[Kitchener, Ontario|City of Kitchener]], Ontario. The blue box recycling system was implemented as part of the city's waste management procedures. The blue box system and variations of it remain in place in hundreds of cities around the world.

==Overview==
Today, many municipalities operate blue box programs that accept all forms of paper materials, most plastic packaging, glass containers, [[aluminum can]]s and [[Tin can|steel cans]]. For example, the City of Greater Napanee accepts:
* [[Glass Bottles|Glass bottles]] and jars, including all glass containers which previously contained a food or beverage product.
* Metal food and beverage cans, including all hard shell steel or [[aluminum]] containers which previously contained a food or beverage product.
* [[Aluminium foil|Aluminum foil]], meaning food wrap, food packaging and kitchenware such as pie plates made from a thin sheet of aluminum.
* Rigid-shell plastic containers, including [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PETE#I), high-density polyethylene (HDPE #2), [[low-density polyethylene]] (LDPE #4), polypropylene (PP #5) and polystyrene (PS #6), which previously contained a non-hazardous [[consumer product]].
* Rigid foam plastic containers.
* Newspapers, magazines, flyers and household papers.
* Old boxboard and old cardboard (non-waxed, flattened &amp; bundled no larger than 30"x30"x8").
* Bundled [[plastic bag]]s (LDPE).
* Other material as designated by the town from time to time.

The municipality provides the blue boxes to residents in areas serviced by the recycling program. This usually includes all [[single-family home]]s and townhouse units receiving [[Waste collection|garbage collection]]. Tenants of [[apartment building]]s typically do not use blue boxes but rather deposit their household recyclable materials in larger containers made available.

==History==

===Early stages===
An organization called Pollution Probe was formed in 1969 by students and faculty at the [[University of Toronto]] and in 1971, members published a report stressing the need for recycling. Also in 1971, the Canadian Federal Government first established a national Department of the Environment, known as [[Environment Canada]], with Environmental protection as one of its priorities. The Ontario government followed suit with a Ministry of the Environment in 1972.

Jack McGinnis of Toronto helped form a community-based non-profit organization called "Is Five" Foundation in 1974. Named for a book of poetry by [[e.e. cummings]], Is Five organized Canada’s first multi-material curbside pickup of recyclable material for 80,000 households of [[The Beaches]] neighbourhood of east [[Toronto]]. In 1977, Jack McGinnis and Derek Stephenson created a private consulting company, Resource Integration Systems (RIS) to advise governments in the field of recycling and waste management.

That same year, in response to the [[1973 energy crisis]], Rick Findlay was hired by Environment Canada’s Federal Facilities Program to develop and coordinate a resource conservation program primarily for federal government facilities in Ontario. The program was expected to improve environmental quality and reduce energy demand. The Federal Facilities Program sought advice on a recycling pilot program for [[Canadian Forces Base Borden]] and eventually made contact with RIS. RIS experimented with a variety of techniques to improve the performance recycling and found that participation rates were significantly higher when residents could simply drop their recycling in a plastic box. Initially, the project at CFB Borden used milk crates borrowed from a local grocery store. Participation was likely encouraged by a standing order from the Base Commander to recycle.

Meanwhile, a student and a volunteer at a [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]]/[[Waterloo, Ontario]] office of Pollution Probe, Eric Hellman organized "Garbage Fest 77" in Kitchener to raise awareness about the consequences of garbage production. McGinnis was invited to speak about his experiences with the CFB Borden program. Hellman also requested a representative from Superior Sanitation (later to be Laidlaw Waste Systems Ltd), the local garbage collection contractor, and an employee named Nyle Ludolph attended Garbage Fest. After meeting McGinnis at the festival, Ludolph became an enthusiastic recycler at his own home and helped increase Laidlaw’s presence in recycling. Nyle managed "Total Recycling Systems", a subsidiary of Superior Sanitation/Laidlaw.

In 1978, Jack McGinnis and Eric Hellman and others met in the basement of the Trinity United Church on Yonge Street in Toronto and created the Recycling Council of Ontario.

===Implementation===
In 1981, after close cooperation with Nyle Ludolph, RIS submitted a proposal to Laidlaw to collect and recycle materials at the curbside for a pilot project in Kitchener, Ontario. Lillian and Ken Croal of Kitchener were the first to use and receive a blue box.  RIS designed the program, and Total Recycling had the responsibility to handle all operations. The Kitchener project included 1,500 households and was tested with four different approaches to recycling:
* Curbside pick-up without providing blue boxes;
* Curbside pick-up with blue boxes;
* Curbside pick-up with blue boxes, including knocking on doors to inform residents; and,
* Composting with composters provided by Laidlaw, free of charge.

The blue box recycling system was proposed to be included as an included “extra” to the regular waste management contract. Laidlaw was successful in obtaining the waste management contract for Kitchener, and the blue box system had its commercial launch. RIS came up with the slogan “We Recycle”, which was applied to every box that went out in Kitchener. Various reasons why the boxes were coloured blue, as opposed to some other colour have been posited: the facts are that RIS felt they looked best and were most visible in blue. It was also a colour that was suitable in terms of withstanding damage from ultraviolet light.

The four recycling approaches were monitored by RIS for one year and the blue box was decided as the most effective. The “test project” continued to run however, and people who did not have the blue boxes began requesting them. Laidlaw received many letters from residents expressing support for the program and for it to continue. The blue box program was implemented citywide in 1983, with Laidlaw providing the extra investment in additional boxes and trucks and handling equipment even though it was not required by their waste management contract with the City. Participation rates ran at 85 percent, and the program was regarded as a success.

In 1984 the Citywide contract for Kitchener went out to public bid, as previously scheduled. City staff simply followed previous procedures – i.e., no specific requirement to offer recycling services was included in bid documents. Laidlaw chose to submit a bid that included continuation of the blue box service while their competitors, mainly large US-based firms, did not. One such competitor submitted a bid that was about $400,000 lower than the one from Laidlaw. The Council meeting where the decision was made was filled with local citizens, especially students, asking their City to support the blue box. The City did, voting to take the blue box bid, not the low bid.

In 1985, Laidlaw won the bid for recycling in the City of Mississauga and introduced the second commercial blue box program in Ontario in June 1986, the largest recycling effort in North America.

Between 1997 and 1999, Laidlaw, Inc. exited the solid waste business after incurring heavy losses through its investments in [[Safety-Kleen]] and Greyhound Lines. After almost 20 years of expansion, Laidlaw Inc. filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in June 2001.
 
Currently in Ontario, Canada industry compensates municipalities for approximately 50% of the net costs to operate the blue box program.&lt;ref name=Mueller2013/&gt;

The blue box system and variations of it remain in place in hundreds of cities around the world.

The '''Burren Action Group''' was a group of people from [[County Clare]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] who opposed plans by the [[Office of Public Works]] during the 1990s to develop a large scale interpretative centre at [[Mullaghmore, County Clare|Mullaghmore]] in the local [[The Burren|Burren area]].&lt;ref name="Leonard154"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tMIJiKtF7ggC&amp;lpg |title= The Environmental Movement in Ireland (Google Books), p. 154|publisher=Springer| date= 2007 |first=Liam |last=Leonard |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goal==
The Group was a collective of concerned locals who fought to maintain the natural integrity of the landscape and to protect the environment from elements of the [[Government of Ireland]] which did not understand what was at stake. They also felt that the Burren and the area of Mullaghmore is a "sacred site" &lt;ref name="Leonard154"/&gt; and holy ground that needed to be defended in a country whose sites of profound historical importance are rapidly disappearing.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==History==
In 1992/1993 seven members of the group lodged a complaint against the project with the [[Irish High Court]], which resulted in work being stopped.&lt;ref name="EURlex"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?mode=dbl&amp;lang=en&amp;ihmlang=en&amp;lng1=en,de&amp;lng2=da,de,el,en,es,fr,it,nl,pt,&amp;val=203965:cs&amp;page= |title=European Court of Justice case|publisher=European Commission| date=  |first=|last=|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These seven included local farmers like James Howard and Patrick McCormack, priest Fr. John O’Donohue, Prof. [[Emer Colleran]] as well as media figures like the producer P.J. Curtis or [[Lelia Doolan]].&lt;ref name="Leonard147"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tMIJiKtF7ggC&amp;lpg |title= The Environmental Movement in Ireland (Google Books), p. 150|publisher=Springer| date= 2007 |first=Liam |last=Leonard |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Burren Action  Group was also supported by leftist politicians like [[Brigid Makowski]].

Following about ten years of opposition, the group was finally successful in March 2000. [[An Bord Pleanála]] confirmed the ruling by the [[Clare County Council]] to refuse planning permission for a scaled-down version of the original plans.&lt;ref name="RTE2"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rte.ie/news/2000/0306/burren.html |title=Planning permission refused for Burren centre|publisher=RTÉ| date= 6 March 2000 |first= |last= |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, James Howard and Patrick McCormack, the latter owner of the house that featured as the parochial house in the [[Father Ted]] TV show, once again opposed a new application to construct a car park at the site of the planned visitors' centre.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.independent.ie/national-news/owner-of-father-ted-house-battles-burren-carpark-plan-3350765.html |title=Owner of 'Father Ted' house battles Burren carpark plan|publisher=Irish Independent| date= 14 January 2013 |first= Gordon|last=Deegan |accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundraising==
The Burren Action Group compiled a [[Album|music album]] in the early 1990s, entitled ''Music in the Stone'' to raise money to save Mullaghmore because ''"...the wheels of greed are rolling towards it"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.iol.ie/~burrenag/tape.htm Music in the Stone] April 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CO2 pump hg.svg|thumb|420px|Air-sea exchange of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

A '''carbon sink''' is a natural or artificial reservoir that accumulates and stores some [[carbon]]-containing chemical compound for an indefinite period. The process by which carbon sinks remove carbon dioxide ({{CO2|link=yes}}) from the atmosphere is known as [[carbon sequestration]]. Public awareness of the significance of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sinks has grown since passage of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which promotes their use as a form of [[carbon offset]]. There are also different strategies used to enhance this process.&lt;ref&gt;Balal Yousaf, Guijian Liu, Ruwei Wang, Qumber Abbas, Muhammad Imtiaz, Ruijia Liu: Investigating the biochar effects on C-mineralization and sequestration of carbon in soil compared with conventional amendments using stable isotope (δ13C) approach. GCB Bioenergy 2016; {{DOI|10.1111/gcbb.12401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
Increase in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] means increase in global temperature. The amount of carbon dioxide varies naturally. The natural sinks are:
* Trees serve as carbon sinks during growing seasons.
* Absorption of [[carbon dioxide]] by the oceans via [[solubility pump|physicochemical]] and [[biological pump|biological]] processes
* [[Photosynthesis]] by terrestrial plants

Whilst the creation of artificial sinks has been discussed, no major artificial systems [[carbon dioxide removal|remove carbon from the atmosphere]] on a material scale.

Carbon sources include:
* Combustion of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil) by humans for energy and transportation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Environmental Protection Agency|first1=United States|title=Overview of Greenhouse Gases|url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/co2.html|website=EPA Climate Change|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Farmland (by animal respiration); there are proposals for improvements in farming practices to reverse this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.extension.org/pages/69145/sources-of-agricultural-greenhouse-gases|title=Sources of Agricultural Greenhouse Gases|last=Powers|first=Crystal|date=January 26, 2016|work=Extension|access-date=2018-02-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kyoto Protocol ==

Because growing vegetation takes in [[carbon dioxide]], the [[Kyoto Protocol]] allows [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I countries|Annex I countries]] with large areas of growing forests to issue [[Removal Units]] to recognize the sequestration of carbon. The additional units make it easier for them to achieve their target emission levels. It is estimated that forests absorb between 10 and 20 [[ton]]s of [[carbon dioxide]] per [[hectare]] each year, through photosynthetic conversion into [[starch]], [[cellulose]], [[lignin]], and wooden [[biomass]]. While this has been well documented for temperate forests and plantations, the [[fauna]] of the tropical forests place some limitations for such global estimates. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Some countries seek to trade emission rights in carbon emission markets, purchasing the unused carbon emission allowances of other countries. If overall limits on greenhouse gas emission are put into place, [[cap and trade]] market mechanisms are purported to find cost-effective ways to reduce emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rff.org/Documents/RFF-RPT-Renewables.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604191032/http://www.rff.org/Documents/RFF-RPT-Renewables.pdf | archivedate=4 June 2007 | title=Electricity, Renewables, and Climate Change: Searching for a Cost-Effective Policy |author1=Karen Palmer |author2=Dallas Burtraw | publisher=[[Resources for the Future]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is as yet no [[carbon audit regime]] for all such markets globally, and none is specified in the Kyoto Protocol.  National carbon emissions are self-declared.

In the [[Clean Development Mechanism]], only [[afforestation]] and [[reforestation]] are eligible to produce [[certified emission reduction]]s (CERs) in the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008–2012). Forest conservation activities or activities avoiding [[deforestation]], which would result in emission reduction through the conservation of existing carbon stocks, are not eligible at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Manguiat, M.

== Storage in terrestrial and marine environments ==

=== Soils ===

[[Soils]] represent a short to long-term carbon storage medium, and contain more carbon than all terrestrial vegetation and the atmosphere combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Soil Science |volume=166 |issue=11 |pages=858–71 |last=Swift |first=Roger S. |title=Sequestration of Carbon by soil |date=November 2001 |doi=10.1097/00010694-200111000-00010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Batjes |first=Niels H. |journal=European Journal of Soil Science |volume=47 |pages=151–63 |title=Total carbon and nitrogen in the soils of the world  |year=1996 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2389.1996.tb01386.x |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.12114_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BatjesGeoderma2016"&gt;{{cite journal|author-last1=Batjes|author-first14=Niels H.|year=2016|title=Harmonised soil property values for broad-scale modelling (WISE30sec) with estimates of global soil carbon stocks |volume=269|pages= 61–68 | doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2016.01.034| url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2016.01.034|bibcode=2016Geode.269...61B}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plant litter]] and other [[biomass]] including [[charcoal]] accumulates as [[Soil organic matter|organic matter]] in soils, and is degraded by [[chemical weathering]] and biological [[biodegradation|degradation]].  More recalcitrant [[organic material|organic]] [[Biopolymer|carbon polymers]] such as [[cellulose]], [[hemi-cellulose]], [[lignin]], aliphatic compounds, waxes and [[terpenoid]]s are collectively retained as [[humus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Klaus Lorenza |author2=Rattan Lala |author3=Caroline M.

[[Leaf litter]] and [[humus]] are rapidly oxidized and poorly retained in [[sub-tropical]] and tropical [[climate]] conditions due to high temperatures and extensive leaching by rainfall. Areas where [[shifting cultivation]] or [[slash and burn]] agriculture are practiced are generally only fertile for 2–3 years before they are abandoned.  These tropical jungles are similar to coral reefs in that they are highly efficient at conserving and circulating necessary nutrients, which explains their lushness in a nutrient desert.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}  Much [[soil carbon|organic carbon]] retained in many agricultural areas worldwide has been severely depleted due to [[intensive farming]] practices]].

[[Grassland]]s contribute to [[soil organic matter]], stored mainly in their extensive fibrous root mats. Due in part to the climatic conditions of these regions (e.g. cooler temperatures and semi-arid to arid conditions), these soils can accumulate significant quantities of organic matter. This can vary based on rainfall, the length of the winter season, and the frequency of naturally occurring lightning-induced [[Wildfire|grass-fires]].  While these fires release carbon dioxide, they improve the quality of the grasslands overall, in turn increasing the amount of carbon retained in the humic material.  They also deposit carbon directly to the soil in the form of [[Biochar|char]] that does not significantly degrade back to carbon dioxide.

Forest fires release absorbed carbon back into the atmosphere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mooney|first1=Chris|title=The really scary thing about wildfires is how they can worsen climate change|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/05/14/how-massive-wildfires-can-actually-warm-the-planet/|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does deforestation due to rapidly increased oxidation of soil organic matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deforestation &amp; Carbon Emission|url=http://deforestation.geologist-1011.net/|website=Consulting Geologist|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organic matter in [[peat]] bogs undergoes slow [[anaerobic decomposition]] below the surface.  This process is slow enough that in many cases the bog grows rapidly and [[Carbon fixation|fixes]] more carbon from the atmosphere than is released.  Over time, the peat grows deeper.  Peat bogs hold approximately one-quarter of the carbon stored in land plants and soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |last=Chester  |first=Bronwyn |title=The case of the missing sink  |publisher=[[McGill University|McGill]] Reporter  |date=20 April 2000 |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/32/15/roulet/ |accessdate=8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under some conditions, forests and peat bogs may become sources of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, such as when a forest is flooded by the construction of a hydroelectric dam. Unless the forests and peat are harvested before flooding, the rotting vegetation is a source of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[methane]] comparable in magnitude to the amount of carbon released by a fossil-fuel powered plant of equivalent power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7046 | title=Hydroelectric power's dirty secret revealed | publisher=[[New Scientist]] | date=24 February 2005 | accessdate=8 July 2008 | author=Duncan Graham-Rowe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regenerative agriculture ===
{{See also|Biosequestration}}

Current agricultural practices lead to carbon loss from soils. It has been suggested that improved farming practices could return the soils to being a carbon sink. Present worldwide practises of overgrazing are substantially reducing many grasslands' performance as carbon sinks.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Overgrazing Overgrazing]. Encyclopedia of Earth. Sidney Draggan, topic ed.; Cutler J. Cleveland, ed., National council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Rodale Institute]] says that [[regenerative agriculture]], if practiced on the planet’s 3.6 billion tillable acres, could sequester up to 40% of current CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rodaleinstitute.org/files/Rodale_Research_Paper.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910213832/http://www.rodaleinstitute.org/files/Rodale_Research_Paper.pdf |archivedate=10 September 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; They claim that agricultural carbon sequestration has the potential to mitigate global warming. When using biologically based [[regenerative practices]], this dramatic benefit can be accomplished with no decrease in yields or farmer profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Farming Systems Trial|url=http://66.147.244.123/~rodalein/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/FSTbookletFINAL.pdf|publisher=Rodale Institute|accessdate=20 November 2013}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organically managed soils can convert carbon dioxide from a greenhouse gas into a food-producing asset.

In 2006, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, largely from fossil fuel combustion, were estimated at nearly 6.5 billion tons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pubs/PDF/feel2899/feel2899.pdf Carbon Dioxide and Our Ocean Legacy, by Richard A. Feely et. al]&lt;/ref&gt; If a 2,000 (lb/ac)/year sequestration rate was achieved on all {{convert|434000000|acre|km2}} of cropland in the United States, nearly 1.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide would be sequestered per year, mitigating close to one quarter of the country's total fossil fuel emissions.

=== Oceans ===
Presently, oceans are CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sinks, and represent the largest active carbon sink on Earth, absorbing more than a quarter of the carbon dioxide that humans put into the air.&lt;ref name=EarthInst&gt;[http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2586 ''Earth Institute News''], Columbia University, 18 Nov. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[solubility pump]] is the primary mechanism responsible for the CO2 absorption by the oceans.

The [[biological pump]] plays a negligible role, because of the limitation to pump by ambient light and nutrients required by the [[phytoplankton]] that ultimately drive it. [[Total inorganic carbon]] is not believed to limit [[primary production]] in the oceans, so its increasing availability in the ocean does not directly affect production (the situation on land is different, since enhanced atmospheric levels of [[CO2 fertilization effect|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; essentially "fertilize"]] land plant growth to some threshold). However, [[ocean acidification]] by invading anthropogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may affect the biological pump by negatively impacting [[calcium carbonate|calcifying]] organisms such as [[coccolithophore]]s, [[foraminiferans]] and [[pteropod]]s. [[Climate change]] may also affect the biological pump in the future by warming and [[stratification (water)|stratifying]] the surface ocean, thus reducing the supply of limiting nutrients to surface waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Doney, S., Fabry, V., Feely, R. &amp; Kleypas, J. |year=2009|title=Ocean Acidification: The Other CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Problem|journal=Annual Review of Marine Science|volume= 1|pages= 169–192|doi=10.1146/annurev.marine.010908.163834|bibcode = 2009ARMS....1..169D |url=http://www.nrdc.org/oceans/acidification/files/NRDC-OceanAcidFSWeb.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] announced a joint study to determine whether the ocean off the California coast was serving as a carbon source or a carbon sink.  Principal instrumentation for the study will be self-contained CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monitors placed on [[buoy]]s in the ocean.  They will measure the partial pressure of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the ocean and the atmosphere just above the water surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Battelle announces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Monitor |journal=[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]] |pages=66 |date=19 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, Science Daily reported that the Southern Indian Ocean is becoming less effective at absorbing carbon dioxide due to changes to the region's climate which include higher wind speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=CNRS (Délégation Paris Michel-Ange) |title=Ocean Less Effective At Absorbing Carbon Dioxide Emitted By Human Activity |date=23 February 2009|work=ScienceDaily |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090216092937.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On longer timescales, oceans may be both sources and sinks – during [[ice age]]s {{CO2}} levels decrease to ≈180 ppmv, and much of this is believed to be stored in the oceans. As ice ages end, {{CO2}} is released from the oceans and {{CO2}} levels during previous interglacials have been around ≈280 ppmv. This role as a sink for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is driven by two processes, the [[solubility pump]] and the [[biological pump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The former is primarily a function of differential CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solubility in [[seawater]] and the [[thermohaline circulation]], while the latter is the sum of a series of biological processes that transport carbon (in [[organic chemistry|organic]] and [[inorganic chemistry of carbon|inorganic]] forms) from the surface [[photic zone|euphotic zone]] to the ocean's interior.  A small fraction of the organic carbon transported by the biological pump to the [[seabed|seafloor]] is buried in [[anoxic sea water|anoxic]] conditions under sediments and ultimately forms [[fossil fuel]]s such as [[petroleum|oil]] and natural gas.

At the end of glacials with sea level rapidly rising, corals tend to grow slower due to increased ocean temperature as seen on the Showtime series "Years of Living Dangerously".  The calcium carbonate from which coral skeletons are made is just over 60% carbon dioxide.  If we postulate that coral reefs were eroded down to the glacial sea level, then coral reefs have grown 120m upward since the end of the recent glacial.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Truly mature tropical forests, by definition, grow rapidly as each tree produces at least 10 new trees each year. Based on studies of the [[FAO]] and [[UNEP]] it has been estimated that Asian forests absorb about 5 tonnes of carbon dioxide per hectare each year. The global cooling effect of carbon sequestration by forests is partially counterbalanced in that reforestation can decrease the reflection of sunlight ([[albedo]]). Mid-to-high latitude forests have a much lower [[albedo]] during snow seasons than flat ground, thus contributing to warming. Modeling that compares the effects of albedo differences between forests and grasslands suggests that expanding the land area of forests in temperate zones offers only a temporary cooling benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6184577.stm | title=Care needed with carbon offsets | author=Jonathan Amos |publisher=BBC | accessdate=8 July 2008 | date=15 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the United States in 2004 (the most recent year for which EPA statistics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/usinventoryreport.html | title=U.S. Greenhouse Gas Inventory Reports | publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] | accessdate=8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; are available), forests sequestered 10.6% (637 MegaTonnes&lt;ref name=epa1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/downloads06/06LULUCF.pdf |title=Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] |accessdate=8 July 2008 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523085328/http://epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/downloads06/06LULUCF.pdf |archivedate=23 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;) of the carbon dioxide released in the United States by the combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas; 5657 MegaTonnes&lt;ref name=epa2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/downloads06/06ES.pdf |title=Executive Summary |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] |accessdate=8 July 2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718165541/http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/downloads06/06ES.pdf |archivedate=18 July 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Urban trees sequestered another 1.5% (88 MegaTonnes&lt;ref name=epa1 /&gt;).  To further reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by 7%, as stipulated by the [[Kyoto Protocol]], would require the planting of "an area the size of Texas [8% of the area of Brazil] every 30 years".&lt;ref&gt;William H. Schlesinger, dean of the Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences at Duke University, in Durham, North Carolina.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carbon offset]] programs are planting millions of fast-growing trees per year to reforest tropical lands, for as little as $0.10 per tree; over their typical 40-year lifetime, one million of these trees will fix 1 to 2 MegaTonnes of carbon dioxide.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}  In Canada, reducing timber harvesting would have very little impact on carbon dioxide emissions because of the combination of harvest and stored carbon in manufactured wood products along with the regrowth of the harvested forests. Additionally, the amount of carbon released from harvesting is small compared to the amount of carbon lost each year to forest fires and other natural disturbances.&lt;ref name="cfs.nrcan.gc.ca"/&gt;

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] concluded that "a sustainable forest management strategy aimed at maintaining or increasing forest carbon stocks, while producing an annual sustained yield of timber fibre or energy from the forest, will generate the largest sustained mitigation benefit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/ar4-wg3-chapter9.pdf | publisher=International Panel on Climate Change | title=Fourth Assessment Report (AR4): Mitigation of Climate Change (Working Group III) | pages=549 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable management practices keep forests growing at a higher rate over a potentially longer period of time, thus providing net sequestration benefits in addition to those of unmanaged forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ruddell |first=Steven |date=September 2007 |title=The Role for Sustainably Managed Forests in Climate Change Mitigation |journal=Journal of Forestry |volume=105 |issue=6|pages=314–319 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life expectancy of forests varies throughout the world, influenced by tree species, site conditions and natural disturbance patterns.  In some forests carbon may be stored for centuries, while in other forests carbon is released with frequent stand replacing fires. Forests that are harvested prior to stand replacing events allow for the retention  of carbon in manufactured forest products such as lumber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J. Chatellier |title=The Role of Forest Products in the Global Carbon Cycle: From In-Use to End-of-Life |publisher=Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies |date=January 2010 |url=http://gisf.research.yale.edu/forest_carbon_report/Chapter_13.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705163108/http://gisf.research.yale.edu/forest_carbon_report/Chapter_13.pdf |archivedate=5 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, only a portion of the carbon removed from logged forests ends up as durable goods and buildings.  The remainder ends up as sawmill by-products such as pulp, paper and pallets, which often end with incineration (resulting in carbon release into the atmosphere) at the end of their lifecycle. For instance, of the 1,692 MegaTonnes of carbon harvested from forests in Oregon and Washington (U.S) from 1900 to 1992, only 23% is in long-term storage in forest products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Harmon | first1 = M.

=== Oceans ===
{{See also|Iron fertilization|Enhanced weathering|Ocean nourishment}}
One way to increase the carbon sequestration efficiency of the oceans is to add micrometre-sized iron particles in the form of either [[hematite]] (iron oxide) or [[melanterite]] (iron sulfate) to certain regions of the ocean. This has the effect of stimulating growth of [[plankton]].  Iron is an important nutrient for [[phytoplankton]], usually made available via upwelling along the [[continental shelves]], inflows from rivers and streams, as well as deposition of dust suspended in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Natural sources of ocean iron have been declining in recent decades, contributing to an overall decline in ocean productivity (NASA, 2003).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  Yet in the presence of iron nutrients plankton populations quickly grow, or 'bloom', expanding the base of [[biomass]] productivity throughout the region and removing significant quantities of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere via [[photosynthesis]].  A test in 2002 in the [[Southern Ocean]] around [[Antarctica]] suggests that between 10,000 and 100,000 carbon atoms are sunk for each iron atom added to the water.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  More recent work in Germany (2005) suggests that any biomass carbon in the oceans, whether exported to depth or recycled in the [[euphotic zone]], represents long-term storage of carbon.  This means that application of iron nutrients in select parts of the oceans, at appropriate scales, could have the combined effect of restoring ocean productivity while at the same time mitigating the effects of human caused emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Because the effect of periodic small scale phytoplankton blooms on ocean ecosystems is unclear, more studies would be helpful.  Phytoplankton have a complex effect on cloud formation via the release of substances such as [[dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS) that are converted to sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, providing [[cloud condensation nuclei]], or CCN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Roelofs, G.|year=2008|title= A GCM study of organic matter in marine aerosol and its potential contribution to cloud drop activation|journal=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics|volume= 8|pages=709–719|doi=10.5194/acp-8-709-2008|hdl=2066/34516}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the effect of small scale plankton blooms on overall DMS production is unknown.

Other nutrients such as nitrates, phosphates, and silica as well as iron may cause ocean fertilization.  There has been some speculation that using pulses of fertilization (around 20 days in length) may be more effective at getting carbon to ocean floor than sustained fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/proceedings/01/carbon_seq/p25.pdf | title=Sequestration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by ocean fertilization |author1=Michael Markels, Jr |author2=Richard T. Barber | publisher=NETL Conference on Carbon Sequestration | date= 14–17 May 2001 | accessdate=8 July 2008 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some controversy over seeding the oceans with iron however, due to the potential for increased toxic phytoplankton growth (e.g. "[[red tide]]"), declining water quality due to overgrowth, and increasing anoxia in areas harming other sea-life such as zooplankton, fish, coral, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenseaventure.com/Questions_Concerns.html |title=Questions and Concerns |publisher=GreenSea Venture |accessdate=8 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415163507/http://www.greenseaventure.com/Questions_Concerns.html |archivedate=15 April 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jembe.2004.08.014 |title=Effects of selenium, iron and cobalt addition to growth and yessotoxin production of the toxic marine dinoflagellate Protoceratium reticulatum in culture |year=2004 |last1=Mitrovic |first1=Simon M. |last2=Fernández Amandi |first2=Monica |last3=McKenzie |first3=Lincoln |last4=Furey |first4=Ambrose |last5=James |first5=Kevin J. |journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology |volume=313 |issue=2 |pages=337–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soils ===
Since the 1850s, a large proportion of the world's grasslands have been tilled and converted to croplands, allowing the rapid oxidation of large quantities of soil organic carbon.  However, in the United States in 2004 (the most recent year for which EPA statistics are available), agricultural soils including pasture land sequestered 0.8% (46 teragrams&lt;ref name=epa1 /&gt;) as much carbon as was released in the United States by the combustion of fossil fuels (5988 teragrams&lt;ref name=epa2 /&gt;).  The annual amount of this sequestration has been gradually increasing since 1998.&lt;ref name=epa1 /&gt;

Methods that significantly enhance carbon sequestration in soil include [[no-till farming]], residue mulching, [[cover crop]]ping, and [[crop rotation]], all of which are more widely used in [[organic farming]] than in conventional farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July05/organic.farm.vs.other.ssl.html | title=Organic farming produces same corn and soybean yields as conventional farms, but consumes less energy and no pesticides, study finds | author=Susan S.

Granger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversion to pastureland, particularly with good management of grazing, can sequester even more carbon in the soil.

[[Terra preta]], an [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]], high-carbon soil, is also being investigated as a sequestration mechanism.
By [[pyrolysis|pyrolysing]] biomass, about half of its carbon can be reduced to [[charcoal]], which can persist in the soil for centuries, and makes a useful soil amendment, especially in tropical soils (''[[biochar]]'' or ''agrichar'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/biochar/Biochar_home.htm |title=Biochar: the new frontier |author=Johannes Lehmann |accessdate=8 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618231424/http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/biochar/Biochar_home.htm |archivedate=18 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Savanna ===

[[Controlled burn]]s on far north Australian [[savanna]]s can result in an overall carbon sink. One working example is the West Arnhem Fire Management Agreement, started to bring "strategic fire management across 28,000 km² of Western Arnhem Land". Deliberately starting controlled burns early in the dry season results in a mosaic of burnt and unburnt country which reduces the area of burning compared with stronger, late dry season fires. In the early dry season there are higher moisture levels, cooler temperatures, and lighter wind than later in the dry season; fires tend to go out overnight. Early controlled burns also results in a smaller proportion of the grass and tree biomass being burnt.&lt;ref name='savanna.ntu.edu.au/arnhem_fire_proj'&gt; {{cite web|url=http://savanna.ntu.edu.au/information/arnhem_fire_project.html |title=West Arnhem Land Fire Abatement Project |accessdate=8 July 2008 |work=Savanna Information |publisher=Tropical Savannas Cooperative Research Centre |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703184208/http://savanna.ntu.edu.au/information/arnhem_fire_project.html |archivedate=3 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emission reductions of 256,000 tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have been made as of 2007.&lt;ref name='savanna.ntu.edu.au/Eureka_arnhem_fire_proj'&gt; {{cite web|url=http://savanna.ntu.edu.au/news/topical_savannas109.html |title=Eureka Win for West Arnhem Land Fire Project |accessdate=8 July 2008 |work=Savanna Information |publisher=Tropical Savannas Cooperative Research Centre |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703184154/http://savanna.ntu.edu.au/news/topical_savannas109.html |archivedate=3 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artificial sequestration ==

For carbon to be sequestered artificially (i.e. not using the natural processes of the carbon cycle) it must first be captured, ''or'' it must be significantly delayed or prevented from being re-released into the atmosphere (by combustion, decay, etc.) from an existing carbon-rich material, by being incorporated into an enduring usage (such as in construction). Thereafter it can be passively stored ''or'' remain productively utilized over time in a variety of ways.

For example, upon harvesting, wood (as a carbon-rich material) can be immediately burned or otherwise serve as a fuel, returning its carbon to the atmosphere, ''or'' it can be incorporated into construction or a range of other durable products, thus sequestering its carbon over years or even centuries.

Indeed, a very carefully designed and durable, energy-efficient and energy-capturing building has the potential to sequester (in its carbon-rich construction materials), as much as or more carbon than was released by the acquisition and incorporation of all its materials and than will be released by building-function "energy-imports" during the structure's (potentially multi-century) existence.  Such a structure might be termed "carbon neutral" or even "carbon negative". Building construction and operation (electricity usage, heating, etc.) are estimated to contribute nearly ''half'' of the annual human-caused carbon additions to the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=Climate Change, Global Warming, and the Built Environment – Architecture 2030 |url=http://www.architecture2030.org |accessdate=23 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natural-gas]] purification plants often already have to remove carbon dioxide, either to avoid [[dry ice]] clogging gas tankers or to prevent carbon-dioxide concentrations exceeding the 3% maximum permitted on the natural-gas distribution grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://naturalgas.org/naturalgas/processing-ng/|title=» Processing Natural Gas NaturalGas.org|website=naturalgas.org|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond this, one of the most likely early applications of carbon capture is the capture of carbon dioxide from [[flue gas]]es at [[power station]]s (in the case of coal, this [[coal pollution mitigation]] is sometimes known as "clean coal"). A typical new 1000 MW [[coal-fired power station]] produces around 6 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. Adding carbon capture to existing plants can add significantly to the costs of energy production; scrubbing costs aside, a 1000 MW coal plant will require the storage of about {{convert|50|Moilbbl|m3}} of carbon dioxide a year. However, scrubbing is relatively affordable when added to new plants based on [[coal gasification]] technology, where it is estimated to raise energy costs for households in the United States using only coal-fired electricity sources from 10 cents per kW·h to 12 cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Can We Bury Global Warming? |first=Robert H. |last=Socolow | journal=[[Scientific American]] |date=July 2005 | pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carbon capture ===
{{Main|Carbon capture and storage}}

Currently, capture of carbon dioxide is performed on a large scale by absorption of carbon dioxide onto various [[Amine gas treating|amine-based solvents]]. Other techniques are currently being investigated, such as [[pressure swing adsorption]], [[temperature swing adsorption]], [[membrane gas separation|gas separation membranes]], [[Distillation#Industrial distillation|cryogenics]] and [[Flue gas|flue capture]].

In coal-fired power stations, the main alternatives to retrofitting amine-based absorbers to existing power stations are two new technologies: [[Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle|coal gasification combined-cycle]] and [[oxy-fuel combustion]]. Gasification first produces a "[[syngas]]" primarily of [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]], which is burned, with carbon dioxide filtered from the flue gas. Oxy-fuel combustion burns the coal in [[oxygen]] instead of [[Air#Composition|air]], producing only carbon dioxide and [[water vapour]], which are relatively easily separated. Some of the combustion products must be returned to the combustion chamber, either before or after separation, otherwise the temperatures would be too high for the turbine.

Another long-term option is carbon capture directly from the air using [[hydroxide]]s. The air would literally be scrubbed of its CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content.  This idea offers an alternative to non-[[Fossil fuel|carbon-based fuels]] for the transportation sector.

Examples of carbon sequestration at coal plants include converting carbon from smokestacks into baking soda,&lt;ref&gt;utility company [http://www.luminant.com/ Luminant]'s pilot version at its [http://www.luminant.com/plants/big_brown.aspx Big Brown Steam Electric Station] in [[Fairfield, Texas]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyonic.com/theCompany.php Skyonic] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218003544/http://www.skyonic.com/theCompany.php |date=18 December 2007 }} plans to circumvent storage problems of [[Supercritical carbon dioxide|liquid {{CO2}}]] by storing baking soda in mines, landfills, or simply to be sold as industrial or food-grade [[baking soda]].&lt;/ref&gt; and algae-based carbon capture, circumventing storage by converting algae into fuel or feed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenfuelonline.com/index.html GreenFuel Technologies Corp.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116170736/http://www.greenfuelonline.com/index.html |date=16 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oceans ===

Another proposed form of carbon sequestration in the ocean is direct injection.  In this method, carbon dioxide is pumped directly into the water at depth, and expected to form "lakes" of liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the bottom. Experiments carried out in moderate to deep waters (350–3600 m) indicate that the liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts to form solid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[clathrate hydrate]]s, which gradually dissolve in the surrounding waters.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

This method, too, has potentially dangerous environmental consequences.  The carbon dioxide does react with the water to form [[carbonic acid]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; however, most (as much as 99%) remains as dissolved molecular CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The equilibrium would no doubt be quite different under the high pressure conditions in the deep ocean. In addition, if deep-sea bacterial [[methanogen]]s that reduce carbon dioxide were to encounter the carbon dioxide sinks, levels of [[methane]] gas may increase, leading to the generation of an even worse greenhouse gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0428/p01s04-wogi.html|title=Potent greenhouse-gas methane has been rising|author=The Christian Science Monitor|work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The resulting environmental effects on [[benthic]] life forms of the [[bathypelagic]], [[abyssopelagic]] and [[hadopelagic]] zones are unknown. Even though life appears to be rather sparse in the deep ocean basins, energy and chemical effects in these deep basins could have far-reaching implications. Much more work is needed here to define the extent of the potential problems.

Carbon storage in or under oceans may not be compatible with the [[Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2005-07-04a.7044.h | title=Carbon Sequestration |author1=Norman Baker |author2=Ben Bradshaw | accessdate=8 July 2008 | date=4 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional method of long-term ocean-based sequestration is to gather [[crop residue]] such as corn stalks or excess hay into large weighted bales of biomass and deposit it in the [[alluvial fan]] areas of the deep [[ocean basin]].  Dropping these residues in alluvial fans would cause the residues to be quickly buried in silt on the sea floor, sequestering the biomass for very long time spans.  Alluvial fans exist in all of the world's oceans and seas where river deltas fall off the edge of the [[continental shelf]] such as the [[Mississippi Delta|Mississippi alluvial fan]] in the [[gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Nile Delta|Nile alluvial fan]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. A downside, however, would be an increase in aerobic bacteria growth due to the introduction of biomass, leading to more competition for oxygen resources in the deep sea, similar to the [[oxygen minimum zone]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

=== Geological sequestration ===

The  method of  ''geo-sequestration'' or ''geological storage'' involves injecting carbon dioxide directly into underground geological formations.  Declining [[oil field]]s, saline [[aquifer]]s, and unminable [[coal seam]]s have been suggested as storage sites.  Caverns and old mines that are commonly used to store natural gas are not considered, because of a lack of storage safety.

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been injected into declining oil fields for more than 40 years, to increase oil recovery.  This option is attractive because the storage costs are offset by the sale of additional oil that is recovered. Typically, 10–15% additional recovery of the original oil in place is possible. Further benefits are the existing infrastructure and the geophysical and geological information about the oil field that is available from the oil exploration. Another benefit of injecting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into Oil fields is that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is soluble in oil.  Dissolving CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in oil lowers the viscosity of the oil and reduces its interfacial tension which increases the oils mobility. All oil fields have a geological barrier preventing upward migration of oil. As most oil and gas has been in place for millions to tens of millions of years, depleted oil and gas reservoirs can contain carbon dioxide for millennia. Identified possible problems are the many 'leak' opportunities provided by old oil wells, the need for high injection pressures and acidification which can damage the geological barrier. Other disadvantages of old oil fields are their limited geographic distribution and depths, which require high injection pressures for sequestration.  Below a depth of about 1000 m, carbon dioxide is injected as a supercritical fluid, a material with the density of a liquid, but the viscosity and diffusivity of a gas.
Unminable coal seams can be used to store CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorbs to the coal surface, ensuring safe long-term storage.  In the process it releases methane that was previously adsorbed to the coal surface and that may be recovered.  Again the sale of the methane can be used to offset the cost of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; storage. Release or burning of methane would of course at least partially offset the obtained sequestration result – except when the gas is allowed to escape into the atmosphere in significant quantities: methane has a higher [[global warming potential]] than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Saline aquifers contain highly mineralized brines and have so far been considered of no benefit to humans except in a few cases where they have been used for the storage of chemical waste.  Their advantages include a large potential storage volume and relatively common occurrence reducing the distance over which CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has to be transported. The major disadvantage of saline aquifers is that relatively little is known about them compared to oil fields. Another disadvantage of saline aquifers is that as the salinity of the water increases, less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be dissolved into aqueous solution. To keep the cost of storage acceptable the geophysical exploration may be limited, resulting in larger uncertainty about the structure of a given aquifer. Unlike storage in oil fields or coal beds, no side product will offset the storage cost. Leakage of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; back into the atmosphere may be a problem in saline-aquifer storage.  However, current research shows that several ''trapping mechanisms'' immobilize the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; underground, reducing the risk of leakage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

A major research project examining the geological sequestration of carbon dioxide is currently being performed at an oil field at [[Weyburn, Saskatchewan|Weyburn]] in south-eastern [[Saskatchewan]]. In the [[North Sea]], Norway's [[Equinor]] natural-gas platform [[Sleipner A|Sleipner]] strips carbon dioxide out of the natural gas with amine solvents and disposes of this carbon dioxide by geological sequestration. Sleipner reduces emissions of carbon dioxide by approximately one million tonnes a year. The cost of geological sequestration is minor relative to the overall running costs. As of April 2005, [[BP]] is considering a trial of large-scale sequestration of carbon dioxide stripped from power plant emissions in the [[Miller oilfield]] as its reserves are depleted.

In October 2007, the [[Bureau of Economic Geology]] at [[The University of Texas at Austin]] received a 10-year, $38 million subcontract to conduct the first intensively monitored, long-term project in the United States studying the feasibility of injecting a large volume of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for underground storage.&lt;ref&gt;"Bureau of Economic Geology Receives $38 Million for First Large-Scale U.S. Test Storing Carbon Dioxide Underground" {{cite web|url=http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/rels/102407.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182402/http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/rels/102407.html |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is a research program of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080719035649/http://www.sseb.org/currentprograms/cpa_cmi.htm Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (SECARB)], funded by the [[National Energy Technology Laboratory]] of the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]]. The SECARB partnership will demonstrate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; injection rate and storage capacity in the [[Tuscaloosa-Woodbine]] geologic system that stretches from Texas to Florida. Beginning in fall 2007, the project will inject CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the rate of one million tons{{Vague|which tons?|date=February 2009}} per year, for up to 1.5 years, into brine up to {{convert|10000|ft|m}} below the land surface near the [[Cranfield oil field]] about {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of [[Natchez, Mississippi]]. Experimental equipment will measure the ability of the subsurface to accept and retain CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Mineral sequestration ===

Mineral sequestration aims to trap carbon in the form of solid [[carbonate]] salts. This process occurs slowly in nature and is responsible for the deposition and accumulation of [[limestone]] over geologic time. [[Carbonic acid]] in groundwater slowly reacts with complex [[silicate]]s to dissolve [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[alkali]]s and [[silica]] and leave a residue of [[clay minerals]]. The dissolved calcium and magnesium react with [[bicarbonate]] to precipitate calcium and magnesium carbonates, a process that organisms use to make shells. When the organisms die, their shells are deposited as sediment and eventually turn into limestone. Limestones have accumulated over billions of years of geologic time and contain much of Earth's carbon. Ongoing research aims to speed up similar reactions involving alkali carbonates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Carbon-capture Technology To Help UK Tackle Global Warming |date=27 July 2007 |work=ScienceDaily |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070727091001.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several serpentinite deposits are being investigated as potentially large scale CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; storage sinks such as those found in NSW, Australia, where the first mineral carbonation pilot plant project is underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mineral carbonation project for NSW |date=9 June 2010 |url=http://www.sustainabilitymatters.net.au/articles/41409-Mineral-carbonation-project-for-NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beneficial re-use of magnesium carbonate from this process could provide feedstock for new products developed for the built environment and agriculture without returning the carbon into the atmosphere and so acting as a carbon sink.

One proposed reaction is that of the olivine-rich rock [[dunite]], or its hydrated equivalent [[serpentinite]] with carbon dioxide to form the carbonate mineral [[magnesite]], plus silica and iron oxide ([[magnetite]]).

Serpentinite sequestration is favored because of the non-toxic and stable nature of magnesium carbonate. The ideal reactions involve the magnesium endmember components of the [[olivine]] (reaction 1) or [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] (reaction 2), the latter derived from earlier olivine by hydration and silicification (reaction 3). The presence of iron in the olivine or serpentine reduces the efficiency of sequestration, since the iron components of these minerals break down to iron oxide and silica (reaction 4).

Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks is a [[metal-organic framework]] carbon dioxide sink which could be used to keep industrial emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] out of the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/02/15/tech-carbon-capture.html CBC News] article ''New materials can selectively capture CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, scientists say'' published 15 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trends in sink performance ==

One study in 2009 found that the fraction of fossil-fuel emissions absorbed by the oceans may have declined by up to 10% since 2000, indicating oceanic sequestration may be sublinear.&lt;ref name=EarthInst/&gt; However, another study by [[Wolfgang Knorr]] indicated that the fraction of {{CO2}} absorbed by carbon sinks has not changed since 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Knorr, W. |title=Is the airborne fraction of anthropogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions increasing? |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=36 |issue=21 |pages=L21710 |year=2009 |doi=10.1029/2009GL040613 |laysummary=[http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2009/6649.html Controversial new climate change results] |laydate=9 November 2009 |bibcode=2009GeoRL..3621710K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| The Chebyshev distance between two spaces on a [[chess]] board gives the minimum number of moves a [[king (chess)|king]] requires to move between them. This is because a king can move diagonally, so that the jumps to cover the smaller distance parallel to a rank or column is effectively absorbed into the jumps covering the larger. Above are the Chebyshev distances of each square from the square f6.
}}

In [[mathematics]], '''Chebyshev distance''' (or '''Tchebychev distance'''), '''maximum metric''', or [[Lp space|L&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; metric]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Modern Mathematical Methods for Physicists and Engineers | author = Cyrus. D. Cantrell | isbn = 0-521-59827-3 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] defined on a [[vector space]] where the [[distance]] between two [[coordinate vector|vector]]s is the greatest of their differences along any coordinate dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Handbook of Massive Data Sets | author = James M. Abello, Panos M. Pardalos, and Mauricio G. C. Resende (editors) | isbn = 1-4020-0489-3 | publisher = Springer | year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[Pafnuty Chebyshev]].

It is also known as '''chessboard distance''', since in the game of [[chess]] the minimum number of moves needed by a [[king (chess)|king]] to go from one square on a [[chessboard]] to another equals the Chebyshev distance between the centers of the squares, if the squares have side length one, as represented in 2-D spatial coordinates with axes aligned to the edges of the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Classification, Parameter Estimation and State Estimation: An Engineering Approach Using MATLAB |author1=David M. J. Tax |author2=Robert Duin |author3=Dick De Ridder | isbn = 0-470-09013-8 | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Chebyshev distance between f6 and e2 equals 4.

== Definition ==
The Chebyshev distance between two vectors or points ''p'' and ''q'', with standard coordinates &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, is

:&lt;math&gt;D_{\rm Chebyshev}(p,q) := \max_i(|p_i - q_i|).\ &lt;/math&gt;
This equals the limit of the [[Lp space|L&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; metrics]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{k \to \infty} \bigg( \sum_{i=1}^n \left| p_i - q_i \right|^k \bigg)^{1/k},&lt;/math&gt;
hence it is also known as the L&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; metric.

Mathematically, the Chebyshev distance is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] induced by the '''[[supremum norm]]''' or '''[[uniform norm]]'''. It is an example of an [[injective metric space|injective metric]].

In two dimensions, i.e. [[plane geometry]], if the points ''p'' and ''q'' have [[Cartesian coordinates]]
&lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_2,y_2)&lt;/math&gt;, their Chebyshev distance is

:&lt;math&gt;D_{\rm Chess} = \max \left ( \left | x_2 - x_1 \right | , \left | y_2 - y_1 \right | \right ) .&lt;/math&gt;

Under this metric, a [[circle]] of [[radius]] ''r'', which is the set of points with Chebyshev distance ''r'' from a center point, is a square whose sides have the length 2''r'' and are parallel to the coordinate axes.

On a chess board, where one is using a ''discrete'' Chebyshev distance, rather than a continuous one, the circle of radius ''r'' is a square of side lengths 2''r,'' measuring from the centers of squares, and thus each side contains 2''r''+1 squares; for example, the circle of radius 1 on a chess board is a 3&amp;times;3 square.

== Properties ==
In one dimension, all L&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; metrics are equal – they are just the absolute value of the difference.

The two dimensional [[Manhattan distance]] also has circles in the form of squares, with sides of length {{sqrt|''2''}}''r'', oriented at an angle of π/4 (45°) to the coordinate axes, so the planar Chebyshev distance can be viewed as equivalent by rotation and scaling to the planar Manhattan distance.

However, this equivalence between L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; metrics does not generalize to higher dimensions. A [[sphere]] formed using the Chebyshev distance as a metric is a [[cube]] with each face perpendicular to one of the coordinate axes, but a sphere formed using [[Manhattan distance]] is an [[octahedron]]: these are [[dual polyhedra]], but among cubes, only the square (and 1-dimensional line segment) are [[self-dual polyhedra|self-dual]] [[polytope]]s.

The Chebyshev distance is sometimes used in [[warehouse]] [[logistics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Logistics Systems |author1=André Langevin |author2=Diane Riopel | publisher = Springer | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-387-24971-0 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9I8HvNfSsk4C&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=Chebyshev+distance++warehouse+logistics&amp;ei=LJXFSLn7FIi8tAOB_8jXDA&amp;sig=ACfU3U27UgodD209FOO7fzTysZFyPJxejw }}&lt;/ref&gt; as it effectively measures the time an [[overhead crane]] takes to move an object (as the crane can move on the x and y axes at the same time but at the same speed along each axis).

On a grid (such as a chessboard), the points at a Chebyshev distance of 1 of a point are the [[Moore neighborhood]] of that point.

'''Chromite''' is an [[iron]] [[chromium]] [[oxide]]: FeCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. It is an [[oxide mineral]] belonging to the [[spinel group]]. Magnesium can substitute for iron in variable amounts as it forms a [[solid solution]] with [[magnesiochromite]] (MgCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindat.org/min-8675.html Mindat&lt;/ref&gt; substitution of [[aluminium]] occurs leading to [[hercynite]] (FeAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindat.org/min-8674.html Mindat&lt;/ref&gt;

It is by far the most industrially important mineral for the production of metallic [[chromium]], used as an alloying ingredient in [[stainless steel|stainless]] and [[tool steel]]s.

==Occurrence==
[[File:Yukon chromite prospect.jpg|thumb|left|A chromite prospect in [[Yukon]]. The black bands are chromite, which also carries [[platinum group metals]]. Gray rock is bleached [[ultramafic]]s.]]
Chromite is found as orthocumulate lenses of [[chromitite]] in [[peridotite]] from the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]]. It also occurs in [[Layered intrusion|layered]] [[ultramafic]] intrusive rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0892-6875(88)90045-3 | title = Chromite- mineralogy and processing | year = 1988 | author = Gu, F | journal = Minerals Engineering | volume = 1 | pages = 235 | last2 = Wills | first2 = B | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is found in metamorphic rocks such as some [[serpentinite]]s.  [[Ore]] deposits of chromite form as early magmatic differentiates. It is commonly associated with [[olivine]], [[magnetite]], [[Serpentine group|serpentine]], and [[corundum]]. The vast [[Bushveld igneous complex]] of [[South Africa]] is a large layered [[mafic]] to [[ultramafic]] igneous body with some layers consisting of 90% chromite making the rare rock type, [[chromitite]].&lt;ref&gt;Guilbert, John M., and Park, Charles F., Jr. (1986) ''The Geology of Ore Deposits,'' Freeman, {{ISBN|0-7167-1456-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stillwater igneous complex]] in [[Montana]] also contains significant chromite.&lt;ref name=Klein/&gt; Chromite is also found in meteorites.&lt;ref name="Chromite"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feick|first1=Kathy|title=Chromite|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/earth-sciences-museum/resources/detailed-rocks-and-minerals-articles/chromite|website=uwaterloo.ca/earth-sciences-museum/|publisher=Earth Science Museum|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world’s largest chromite mine is South Africa but it is also found in the United States, Turkey, Philippines, Finland, Russia and Canada.&lt;ref name="Chromite"/&gt;

==Uses== 
[[File:Chromite by petrographic microscope.jpg|thumb|upright|Chromite viewed under a [[petrographic microscope]]]]
The only ores of chromium are the minerals chromite and magnesiochromite. Most of the time, economic geology names chromite the whole chromite-magnesiochromite series: FeCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, (Fe,Mg)Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, (Mg,Fe)Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and MgCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt; The two main products of chromite refining are [[ferrochromium]] and metallic chromium; for those products the ore smelter process differs considerably. For the production of ferrochromium the chromite ore (FeCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is reduced with either  [[aluminium]] or [[silicon]] in an [[aluminothermic reaction]] and for the production of pure chromium the iron has to be separated from the chromium in a two step roasting and leaching process.&lt;ref name="IndMin"&gt;{{cite book | title =Industrial Minerals &amp; Rocks: Commodities, Markets, and Uses | edition = 7th | publisher = SME | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-87335-233-8 | chapter = Chromite | first = John F. | last = Papp  |author2=Lipin Bruce R. | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zNicdkuulE4C&amp;pg=PA309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromite is also used as a [[refractory]] material, because it has a high heat stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0ugkNtlWKWEC&amp;pg=PA205 | title = Pocket Manual Refractory Materials: Structure - Properties - Verification | first = Gerald | last = Routschka | publisher = Vulkan-Verlag  | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-3-8027-3158-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chromium extracted from chromite is used in [[chrome plating]] and alloying for production of corrosion resistant superalloys, nichrome, and [[stainless steel]]. Chromium is used as a pigment for glass, glazes, and paint, and as an oxidizing agent for tanning leather.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mineralszone.com/minerals/chromite.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes used as a gemstone.&lt;ref&gt;Tables of Gemstone Identification By Roger Dedeyne, Ivo Quintens, p.189&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mining==
[[File:World Chromium Production 2002.svg|thumb|250px|left|Chromium ore output in 2002]]

In 2002 14,600,000 [[metric ton]]s of chromite were mined. The largest producers were [[South Africa]] (44%), [[India]] (18%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chromites of India|url=http://www.geosocindia.org/Goldenjubilee/Fulltext_pdf/RKSahoo.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Kazakhstan]] (16%), [[Zimbabwe]] (5%), Finland (4%), [[Iran]] (4%), and [[Brazil]] with several other countries producing the rest of less than 10% of the world production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mineral Commodity Summary 2006: Chromium | first = John F. | last = Papp | publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]] | accessdate = 2009-02-24 | url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/chromium/chrommcs06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Minerals Yearbook 2006: Chromium | first = John F. | last = Papp | publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]] | accessdate = 2009-02-24 | url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/chromium/myb1-2006-chrom.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minor production===
[[Afghanistan]] has significant deposits of high grade chromite ore, which is mined illegally in [[Khost Province]] and then smuggled out of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/world/asia/afghans-wary-as-efforts-pick-up-to-tap-mineral-riches.html?_r=1&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=edit_th_20120909 | work=The New York Times | first=Graham | last=Bowley | title=Afghans Wary as Efforts Pick Up to Tap Mineral Riches | date=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Pakistan]], chromite is mined from the ultramafic rocks in mainly the [[Muslimbagh]]  [[killa Saifullah District]] and [[Khanozai]] area of [[Pishin District]] of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]].  Most of the chromite is of metallurgical grade with Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; averaging 54% and a chrome to iron ratio of 2.6:1.

Recently, the biggest user of chromite ore has been China, importing large quantities from South Africa, Pakistan, and other countries. The concentrate is used to make [[ferrochrome]], which is in turn used to make [[stainless steel]] and some other alloys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = How Products are Made, Vol. 1 | accessdate = 29 Dec 2010 | url = http://www.madehow.com/Volume-1/Stainless-Steel.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010 the [[Government of Ontario]] announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = YouTube - premierofontario's Channel |publisher = [[YouTube]] | accessdate = 2010-04-13 | url = https://www.youtube.com/user/premierofontario#p/u/6/7wkjwn7X5dE}}&lt;/ref&gt; that they would be opening up a large chromite deposit to development in the northern part of [[Ontario]] known as the [[Northern Ontario Ring of Fire|Ring of Fire]]. This plan has since been suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Cliffs suspends Ring of Fire project in northern Ontario |publisher = [[CBC News]] | accessdate = 2013-11-28 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/cliffs-suspends-ring-of-fire-project-in-northern-ontario-1.2434628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''condensate polisher''' is a device used to filter water condensed from steam as part of the [[steam cycle]], for example in a conventional or [[nuclear power plant]] (powdered resin or deep bed system). It is frequently filled with [[polymer resin]]s which are used to [[ion exchange|remove or exchange ions]] such that the purity of the condensate is maintained at or near that of [[distilled water]].&lt;ref name=NormalAccidents&gt;{{cite book| last =Perrow| first =Charles| authorlink =Charles Perrow| title =Normal Accidents: Living with high-risk technologies| publisher =Princeton University Press| date =1999| isbn =0-691-00412-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Condensate polishers are important in systems using the boiling and condensing of water to transport or transform [[thermal energy]]. Using technology similar to a [[water softener]], trace amounts of minerals or other contamination are removed from the system before such contamination becomes concentrated enough to cause problems by depositing minerals inside pipes, or within precision-engineered devices such as [[boiler]]s, [[steam generator (nuclear power)|steam generator]]s, [[heat exchanger]]s, [[steam turbine]]s, [[cooling tower]]s, and [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensers]].&lt;ref name=NormalAccidents /&gt; The removal of minerals has the secondary effect of maintaining the [[pH]] balance of the water at or near neutral (a pH of 7.0) by removing ions that would tend to make the water more [[acid]]ic. This reduces the rate of [[corrosion]] where water comes in contact with metal.

Condensate polishing typically involves ion exchange technology for the removal of trace dissolved minerals and suspended matter. Commonly used as part of a power plant's condensate system, it prevents premature chemical failure and deposition within the power cycle which would have resulted in loss of unit efficiency and possible mechanical damage to key generating equipment.

During the process of steam generation in power plants, the steam cools and condensate forms. The condensate is collected and then used as [[boiler feedwater]]. Prior to re-use, the condensate must be purified or "polished", to remove impurities (predominantly silica oxides and sodium) which have the potential to cause damage to the boilers, steam generators, reactors and turbines. Both dissolved (i.e. silica oxides) and suspended matter (ex. iron oxide particulates from corrosion, also called 'crud'), as well as other contaminants which can cause corrosion and maintenance issues are effectively removed by condensate polishing treatment.

The proposed '''Crows Nest Wind Farm''', will be located in south-eastern [[Queensland]], 40 kilometres north of [[Toowoomba]].  It initially was to have an installed generating capacity of 124 MW that would produce intermittent electricity that could power some 47,000 homes during periods of high wind. It is expected that the [[wind farm]] will create 460 manufacturing and construction jobs and a further 15 full-time maintenance jobs in [[Crows Nest, Queensland|Crows Nest]]. The Crows Nest location on the western edge of the [[Darling Downs]], offers some of the best average wind speeds available in Queensland, and the project will provide additional security of electricity supply in this fast-growing area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allco.com.au/dm_documents/061213%20Crows%20Nest%20Wind%20Farm%20receives%20Development%20Consent_noE3-.pdf Crows Nest Wind Farm receives Development Consent]&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was acquired by [[AGL Energy]] in 2009 after purchasing it and another wind farm at Barn Hill in South Australia from [[Transfield Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.brisbanetimes.com.au/breaking-news-business/agl-buys-transfield-wind-farm-projects-20090618-citj.html |title=AGL buys Transfield wind farm projects |accessdate=21 May 2010 |date=18 June 2009 |work=[[Brisbane Times]] |publisher=[[Fairfax Digital]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, AGL was allowed to increase the number of turbines by 20 units and therefore the output from 124&amp;nbsp;MW to 200&amp;nbsp;MW. The cost of the project is now expecting to be A$270&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="cnwfga"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thechronicle.com.au/story/2011/02/02/crows-nest-residents-opposed-to-a-giant-wind-farm/ |title=Crows Nest wind farm to go ahead |author=Stuart Cumming |accessdate=28 June 2011 |date=2 February 2011 |newspaper=The Chronicle |publisher=Toowoomba Newspapers Pty Ltd  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections==
Residents of [[Shire of Crows Nest|Crows Nest Shire]] formed a "No Wind Farm" group which objected to the proposal. The activists contended that [[Wind turbine|turbine]] blades would cause light flicker as they passed the sun, turbines would cause noise, devalue land, be a detriment to fauna and visual appeal of the area and were contrary to the council's town plan. They also argued the green credentials of wind farms were a myth because large amounts of coal-fired energy was needed to power up generators to full capacity after a drop in wind speed. After drawn-out legal proceedings and mediation between the parties, the objections were progressively dropped.&lt;ref&gt;(14 December 2006).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4345">[[Bangladesh]] suffers with heavy energy crisis with the gradual expansion of [[Economy of Bangladesh|economic activities of the country]]. The estimations and reserves of energy resources show future potentials but a small fraction of them are being utilized which proved to be insufficient. Moreover, the [[Climate change in Bangladesh|impact of climate change]] and environment pollution has also been significantly felt. As a result, the successive governments have aimed at formulating an effective energy policy which would address these concerns. The energy policies have also received extensive criticisms especially on the questions of energy export and methods of extraction.

== History ==
The first National Energy Policy (NEP) of Bangladesh was formulated in 1996 by the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral resources to ensure proper exploration, production, distribution and rational use of energy resources to meet the growing energy demands of different zones, consuming sectors and consumers groups on a sustainable basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kogan Page|title=Asia and Pacific Review 2003/04|year=2003|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|isbn=9780749440633|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With rapid change of global as well as domestic situation, the policy was updated in 2004. The updated policy included additional objectives namely to ensure environmentally sound sustainable energy development programmes causing minimum damage to environment, to encourage public and private sector participation in the development and management of energy sector and to bring the entire country under electrification by the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Charles K. Ebinger|title=Energy and Security in South Asia: Cooperation Or Conflict?|year=2011|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=9780815704317|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy resources ==
=== Natural gas ===
[[Natural gas]] accounts for about 70% of the country's commercial energy supply. According to a study conducted in 2003 by Hydrocarbon unit of the Energy and Mineral Resources Division and [[Norwegian Petroleum Directorate]], the initial gas reserve of the 22 discovered gas fields of the country amounts to 28.4 trillion [[cubic feet]] (TCF) out of which 20.5 TCF is considered recoverable. In 2000, [[United States Geological Survey]] conducted a study for undiscovered gas reserve of the country. According this study, there are possibilities to explore another 32 TCF of natural gas. Another study conducted by Hydrocarbon Unit and Norwegian Petroleum Directorate in 2001 concluded that additional 42 TCF of natural gas could be discovered in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geological Survey (U.S.)|title=Minerals Yearbook, 2008, V. 3, Area Reports, International, Asia and the Pacific|year=2010|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=9781411329645|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, experts have raised concerns that the existing proven reserves could be extirpated by 2020 and have called for immediate exploration of new gas fields.&lt;ref name="Kamrul"&gt;http://www.dhakatribune.com/op-ed/2013/sep/11/energy-hope-and-reality&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coal ===
Bangladesh has a reserve of approximately 3 billion tons of steam grade [[Bituminous coal]] as discovered till 2003. These reserves are mainly concentrated into the five large coal fields in the northwestern regions of the country, namely Jamalganj, Barapukuria, Khalashpir, Dighipara and Phulbari.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theindependentbd.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=164481:coal-and-bangladeshs-energy-scenario&amp;catid=169:op-ed&amp;Itemid=201&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy conservation ==
The NEP called for conservation measures to be strictly enforced to ensure rational, economic and efficient use of energy. The major means of energy conservation have been pointed out as energy audit, reduction of wastage, demand management and efficient use. Experts have suggested to initiate the energy conservation act, which would significantly reduce the energy demand of the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=227763&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Graph RE Australia 2010.svg|thumb|Electricity generation from renewable sources in Australia, 2010]]

'''Feed-in tariffs in Australia''' are the [[feed-in tariff]]s (FITs) paid under various State schemes to non-commercial producers of electricity generated by [[solar photovoltaic]] (PV) systems using [[solar panel]]s. They are a way of subsidising and encouraging uptake of [[renewable energy]] and in Australia have been enacted at the State level, in conjunction with a federal [[mandatory renewable energy target]].

Australian FIT schemes tend to focus on providing support to solar PV particularly in the residential context, and project limits on installed capacity (such as 10&amp;nbsp;kW in NSW) mean effectively that FITs do not support large scale projects such as wind farms or solar thermal power stations.

==Gross vs. net FIT schemes==
Some schemes are based on a gross feed-in tariff model while most are based on a net tariff.&lt;ref name="ausrenewpolicy"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byrnes |first=L. |last2=Brown |first2=C. |last3=Foster |first3=J. |last4=Wagner |first4=L. |date=December 2013 |title=Australian renewable energy policy: Barriers and challenges |journal=Renewable Energy |volume=60 |pages=711–721 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148113003170 |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2013.06.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Net feed-in tariff schemes have been criticised for not providing enough incentive for households to install solar panels and thus for not effectively encouraging the uptake of solar PV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/energy-smart/get-paid-for-solar-power-on-your-roof/2008/11/23/1227375061994.html |title=Get paid for solar power on your roof |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=24 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bspq.com.au/solar-rebates/solar-feed-in-tariffs/|title=Solar Feed-in-tariffs|date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been described as a "fake feed-in tariff". Critics of net FIT argue that gross tariffs conform to the normal definition of a feed-in tariff, and provide a more certain financial return, paying for all electricity produced, even if it is consumed by the producer, reducing or helping meet peak demand. The issue still remains as to what level the FIT rate should be set — e.g., at the cost of production, at market rates, at the cost at which the retailer sells electricity, or at the rate at which the retailer can acquire electricity in the wholesale market, while others set them at premium or subsidy levels.

The effective difference is that household producers under a gross scheme pay for electricity from the electricity retailer for household consumption at the market rate while all the power produced by them is sold to the retailer at the higher subsided FIT rate. Net FIT schemes effectively use the same rate for the use of electricity by household producers as for sale into the grid (i.e., use of electricity by the household reduces the amount of electricity available to feed into the grid), and accordingly the subsidy to household producers is generally less in overall terms.

The [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] and [[New South Wales]] had gross feed-in tariffs, which were subsequently replaced with net feed-in tariffs.

==Proposed federal gross feed-in tariff scheme==
A uniform federal scheme to supersede all State schemes has been proposed by Tasmanian Greens Senator [[Christine Milne]], but not enacted. National feed-in tariff systems have been enacted in numerous countries including Brazil, Canada, China and many EU countries.&lt;ref&gt;Dr James Prest [http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/committee/eca_ctte/renewable_energy/submissions/sub123.pdf Submission to Senate Inquiry into Feed-in Bill 2008]. Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ray Block (28 April 2009). [http://blocksindicator.com/2009/04/feed-in-tariff-fit-and-the-fallout-in-the-solar-pv-market/ Feed-in Tariff (FIT) and the fallout in the solar PV market]. Block’s Indicator of Sustainable Growth.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Parliament has not yet enacted a national gross feed-in tariff scheme for renewable energy. However, a capital grant/rebate was offered of up to $8,000 per household for domestic installations and 50% for school installations up until June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/settlements/renewable/pv/index.html Solar Homes and Communities Plan]. Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, a bill was introduced by [[Australian Greens]] Senator [[Christine Milne]], (Tasmania), called the ''Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Feed-In Tariff) Bill 2008''. The bill was the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts.

More than 23,000 people have signed an online petition for a national gross feed-in tariff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feedintariff.com.au/index.php feedintariff.com.au]. An Energy Matters community initiative.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech, the Federal Minister for Energy, [[Martin Ferguson]], said that feed-in tariffs are technologically prescriptive and ideologically based, rather than being a market based mechanism. In response to the [[Feed-in tariffs in Germany|German feed-in tariff for solar]], he suggested that Germany's solar subsidy meant German consumers paid more than €1 billion in additional power bills in 2007 to generate around 0.5% of Germany’s gross electricity consumption, suggesting that the policy does not deliver value for money. He also suggested that an Australian solar feed-in tariff may lead to greater PV panel imports rather than a significant expansion of Australian production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minister.ret.gov.au/TheHonMartinFergusonMP/Pages/SOLARFLAGSHIPSFORUM.aspx Solar Flagships Forum] The Hon Martin Ferguson AM MP&lt;/ref&gt; However commentators have suggested that Martin Ferguson's comments are ideologically driven and do not take into account the [[Merit order|Merit Order Effect]] which in some instance negates or almost negates the cost of funding FiTs and in other instances shows funding FiTs delivers a net dividend to consumers.

===Australian Capital Territory===
Under the [http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2008-21/default.asp Electricity Feed-in (Renewable Energy Premium) Act 2008], Canberrans can install [[photovoltaic]] (solar) cells or other [[renewable sources]], produce their own energy, and sell it back to the [[power grid]] but perhaps not until July 2009. They'll be paid a [[tariff]] 3.88 times the retail cost of [[electricity]] (60c/[[kWh]] Jan 2009) for the energy they feed back into the [[electrical grid]] for up to 20 years from the date they sign up to the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2008-21/default.asp Electricity Feed-in (Renewable Energy Premium) Act 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a gross metered scheme meaning that owners get paid a premium rate for all [[electricity]] produced by their installation with their own usage being metered separately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hansard.act.gov.au/hansard/2008/week07/2577.htm Legislative Assembly for the ACT: 2008 Week 7 Hansard (2 July) Page 2577]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] scheme will be the most generous feed in scheme in Australia when it comes into operation some time after March 2009.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

As the [[Australian Capital Territory]] ("ACT") scheme is a gross feed in scheme, it is a relatively easy task to estimate the payback time for various system sizes because the calculation is independent of electricity consumption. e.g. a well positioned location in the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] could produce approximately 1800 [[kWh]] per year from a 1&amp;nbsp;kW system{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} or A$1,080 per year at a price of 60 c/[[kWh]]. On this basis payback for a 1&amp;nbsp;kW system costing $5,000 net (includes $8,000 federal rebate &amp; 22 RECS) would be around 5 years. Larger systems would take longer but would have a larger income stream over the life of the system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The ACT Government established an inter-departmental committee to look at feed in tariffs in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;(15 November 2007). [http://www.electricalsolutions.net.au/news/12146-ACT-considers-a-renewable-energy-feed-in-tariff ACT considers a renewable energy feed-in tariff]. ElectricalSolutions. Westwick-Farrow. Retrieved 12 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some concern that a proposed commercial [[solar power plant]], the feasibility of which is to be examined by a joint study be ACT government and [[ActewAGL]],&lt;ref&gt;(8 May 2008). [http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/03/19/2193657.htm?section=business Mixed reaction to solar power plan]. ABC News.  Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Retrieved 12 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; may undermine the proposed feed in tariff proposal.

The submission of the Independent Competition and Regulatory Commission 25 February 2008 was that there were issues to be resolved including:
* overall effectiveness and efficiency
* cross-subsidy elements
* equity issues particularly for households suffering financial hardship
* a gross or net approach is adopted
* a clearly predefined finite life (no more than 5 years);
* a partial subsidy rather than full cost recovery
* ability to terminate if national policies are introduced e.g. carbon tax
* transparency of tariff setting&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/95647/ICRC_Submission_Feed-in-Tariff_25-2-08.pdf Feed-In Tariff Discussion Paper — Comments February 2008] ACT Govt ''Independent Competition and Regulatory Commission''&lt;/ref&gt;

On the grounds that a capacity cap of 30MW had been reached, the FIT scheme in the ACT was closed to micro and medium scale generators at midnight on 13 July 2011 just days after the legislation was amended (by the Greens and Liberal parties voting together against the will of the government Labor party) on 12 July 2011 to enable micro-generators to continue to access it. The micro-generator category under the Act had earlier been closed on 31 May 2011 once a statutory cap of 15&amp;nbsp;MW had been reached.

===South Australia===
In September 2006, it was announced that the ''Electricity (Feed-In Scheme-Solar Systems) Amendment Bill 2008'' would come into force on 1 July 2008 and run out on 30 June 2028. The normal tariff for electricity is $0.26 / kWh and the feed-in tariff was set at $0.44 / kWh.&lt;ref name="sfis"/&gt; The result is that not only will thousands of South Australian homes have solar systems installed, but many businesses will now have the opportunity to embrace this technology and turn their roofs into mini-renewable power stations. The former South Australian Premier, [[Mike Rann]], wanted the government to be [[carbon neutral]] by the year 2020.&lt;ref name="sagcn"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/features/environment/sa-government-to-go-carbon-neutral/story-e6frflp0-1111115581007 |title=SA Government to go carbon neutral |accessdate=12 January 2012 |date=18 February 2008 |work=news.com.au |publisher=News Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original intent of some parties, for the feed-in tariff to increase with increases to the price of [[electricity]], at a multiple of two was negotiated out before legislated. The 44 cent [[tariff]] is only paid for any electricity exported, so only when the system output exceeds domestic demand.

The solar feed-in scheme commenced on 1 July 2008. It was reviewed in 2009-10 and amendments to the legislation took effect from 29 July 2011. The major change to the scheme was to introduce the concept of customer groups, dependent on the dates of approval and connection of the solar PV system, and the reduction of the feed-in tariff for customers receiving approval after 30 September 2011.

Groups 1, 2 and 3 (broadly existing customers) will continue to receive 44 cents and in addition will receive a minimum retailer payment (estimated to start at about 6 cents) to give a total feed-in payment of about 50 cents. Group 4 (approved permission to connect received between 1 October 2011 and 30 September 2013) will receive 16 cents plus the minimum retailer payment to give a total feed-in payment of about 22 cents. Group 5 (approved permission to connect received after 30 September 2013) will not receive any feed-in tariff, but will be eligible for the minimum retailer payment, that is a total payment of about 6 cents. Retailers are free to pay customers more than the legislated minimum rates.

The feed-in tariffs are fixed until 30 June 2028 for Groups 1, 2 and 3 (i.e. the 44 cent rate), and until 30 September 2016 for Group 4 (i.e. the 16 cent rate). The minimum retailer payment will be determined by the Essential Services Commission of South Australia (ESCOSA) has been estimated to commence at about 6 cents from 1 January 2013, and will be reviewed and is expected to increase with the price of electricity over time.&lt;ref name="sfis"&gt;[http://www.sa.gov.au/subject/Water%2C+energy+and+environment/Energy/Energy+rebates%2C+concessions+and+incentives/Solar+electricity+rebates+and+incentives/Solar+feed-in+scheme#minimum Solar feed-in scheme]. Government of South Australia. Retrieved 12 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebates: The South Australian government does not offer any additional rebates or incentives to domestic customers, it’s a solar schools program.
Estimated payback: It’s very hard to calculate, but it will be best for systems of largest eligible size, where the domestic demand is smallest, or mainly occurs at night and low power consumption during the day. Houses without air-conditioning would seem to fit the bill.&lt;ref&gt;(19 February 2008).

===New South Wales===
On 8 May 2008, the NSW government announced that it intended to introduce feed in tariffs. Further details of the solar feed in tariff in NSW were announced on 23 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.theage.com.au/national/nsw-to-introduce-solar-feedin-tariff-20081123-6ex0.html|title=NSW to introduce solar feed-in tariff|publisher=The Age|accessdate=30 June 2009|location=Melbourne|date=23 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705092604/http://news.theage.com.au/national/nsw-to-introduce-solar-feedin-tariff-20081123-6ex0.html|archivedate=5 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NSW Feed-in Tariff Taskforce was established to advise the NSW Government on the details of a feed-in tariff scheme for NSW. Its representatives are from the Department of Water and Energy, the Department of Environment and Climate Change, the Department of Premier and Cabinet and NSW Treasury. In January 2009, the Taskforce issued a submission on the design of a feed-in tariff scheme for NSW.

On 23 June 2009, the government announced a Solar Bonus Scheme. This is a net feed-in tariff for the state rather than a gross tariff. Under this 20-year scheme, some residents, schools, small businesses and community groups will be paid $0.60 per kwh for the net amount of electricity sold back into the grid. As few as 42,000 households are expected to take advantage of the scheme.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The scheme was set to begin on 1 January 2010 and to be reviewed in 2012.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The Solar Bonus Scheme is payable to energy customers with solar panel systems up to 10&amp;nbsp;kW in size;.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Cubby (24 July 2009).

Retrieved 12 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 November 2009 it was reported that NSW will switch to a gross feed in tariff.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} This is expected to increase the average amount received by a household with solar panels by $1500 pa, a 60% increase, highlighting the difference in effect of gross compared to net feed in tariffs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} This is expected to reduce the payback period for installation costs to about 8 years. The gross tariff will cost all households about $2 pa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/rees-takes-a-shine-to-solar-panel-incentive-20091109-i5gt.html|title=Rees takes a shine to solar panel incentive|last=Robbins|first=Brian|date=10 November 2009|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|pages=1|accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010 the New South Wales government cut the solar feed in tariff to $0.20 per kWh, the lowest level in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/2000-jobs-tipped-to-go-from-nsw-solar-cuts-20101104-17f06.html|title=2000 jobs tipped to go from NSW solar cuts |last=AAP|first=|date=4 November 2010|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|pages=1|accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011 the NSW FIT (Solar Bonus) scheme was retrospectively closed to new applicants and removed for current users after a Ministerial declaration was made under s.15A(8C) Electricity Supply Act 1995 (NSW) that the cumulative total installed capacity cap of 300 MW had been reached.

A new feed-in tariff is proposed, with the constraint that it not raise the cost of electricity and not involve funding from the NSW government. This inherently limits the FIT to less than the consumer electricity cost, and does not conform to the normal definition of a feed-in tariff. A feed-in tariff of from 5.2 to 10.3 cents/kWh is proposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipart.nsw.gov.au/Home/Industries/Electricity/Reviews/Retail_Pricing/Solar_feed-in_tariffs/14_Mar_2012_-_Consumer_Fact_Sheet_on_Final_Report/Fact_Sheet_-_Consumer_-_A_fair_and_reasonable_solar_feed-in_tariff_for_NSW_-_Solar_Feed-in_Tariffs_-_14_March_2012 Fact Sheet - Consumers]&lt;/ref&gt; By the normal definition of a feed-in tariff, the cost of a new and expensive generation source, e.g. solar panels, is borne by all of the consumers rather than the early adopters, who instead are rewarded. It is implemented in the expectation that volume will reduce the cost, thus allowing more people to use that source. Feed-in tariff advocacy organizations claim that feed-in tariff is both the least expensive, and the most effective incentive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wind-works.org/FeedLaws/Germany/StatusofFeed-inTariffsinEurope2010.html Status of Feed-in Tariffs in Europe 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Australia===

The Western Australian Government had committed to a limited Gross feed in tariff for household scale PV.  The scheme was to be funded for four years at a cost of $13.5m and based on a payment of 60c kW/h to re cover the capital cost of the system after any rebates.  After the capital cost is paid back the tariff will revert to a lower rate or the existing Renewable Energy Buyback Scheme (REBS).&lt;ref name="synpricsched1" /&gt;

On 2 June 2009 the state government backflipped on this promise and has deferred the introduction of the scheme for 1 year until 1 July 2010.  In the new scheme a net metering system would be applied rather than gross.  The $13.5m of funds had already been allocated to systems installed prior to the 1 July 2009 implementation date in a public display of support for the concept.  The over-subscription highlighted the imbalance between public and state support for the renewable energy industry.&lt;ref name="sgstres"&gt;Peter Collier (2 June 2009). [http://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Results.aspx?ItemID=131978 State Government scheme targets renewable energy systems]. State Government Media Statement. Retrieved 14 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2010, the net feed in tariff commenced and existing customers can migrate to the new billing system. New customers will need to sign up the Renewable Energy Buyback Scheme from their state electricity provider, [[Synergy (electricity corporation)|Synergy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.synergy.net.au/at_home/feedintariff.xhtml Feed-in tariff]. Synergy. Retrieved 12 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Feed In Tariff offered by the state government is 40 cents whilst Synergy offers 7 cents via the Renewable Energy Buyback Scheme. Once the customer signs up, they will receive both incentives for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infiniteenergy.com.au/solarenergygovernmentincentives.html Government Incentives]. Infinite Energy. Retrieved 12 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2011, the state government suspended all new applications for the Feed in Tariff, citing the expense of the programme as the reason.&lt;ref name="sgstres"/&gt;

The situation is better for Horizon Power residential customers, who are offered renewable energy buy-back rates equal to their electricity tariff rate (A2 tariff) less the GST component (10%). The current electricity charge - cents per unit is 20.83c including GST. Horizon Power's rebate is more than double the rate paid by Synergy.

===Queensland===
[[File:Solar hot water service.JPG|thumb|A solar hot water panel and integrated tank on a house roof, 2006]]
The Queensland Government Solar Bonus Scheme is a program that pays domestic and other small energy customers for the surplus electricity generated from roof-top [[solar photovoltaic]] (PV) systems that is exported to the Queensland grid. It commenced on 1 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleanenergy.qld.gov.au/solar_bonus_scheme.cfm Office of Clean Energy - Solar Bonus Scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422075453/http://www.cleanenergy.qld.gov.au/solar_bonus_scheme.cfm |date=22 April 2011 }}. Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation. Retrieved 14 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme provides for 44c/kWh (around twice times the current general domestic use tariff of 21.35c/kWh (including GST)) on the net amount exported to the grid, subject to having proper metering installed.

A feed-in tariff will ensure that Queenslanders benefit from the federal Photovoltaic Rebate Program.&lt;ref&gt;(24 June 2007) [http://www.enviro-friendly.com/ClimateSmart_2050.pdf ClimateSmart 2050: Queensland climate change strategy 2007: a low-carbon future].

===Victoria===
In November 2009 Victoria set up a net metered feed-in tariff scheme, under which households were paid 60 cents for every excess kilowatt hour of energy fed back into the state electricity grid. This was about twice the then current retail price for electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.dpi.vic.gov.au/energy/policy/greenhouse-challenge/feed-in-tariffs]. Department of Primary Industries. October 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914121220/http://new.dpi.vic.gov.au/energy/policy/greenhouse-challenge/feed-in-tariffs |date=14 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The feed-in tariff scheme was to run for 15 years from November 2009, and applied to all household systems of up to 5&amp;nbsp;kW capacity and had a cap of 100MW of generating capacity and/or a $10 per annum increase in the average household electricity bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/dpi/dpinenergy.nsf/LinkView/7AFCBB81592B8111CA2576350020903D3E1179147BC310BACA257635001F2BEF |title=Premium Rate for Solar Power |date=September 2009 |publisher=Department of Primary Industries |accessdate=6 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004115901/http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/dpi/dpinenergy.nsf/LinkView/7AFCBB81592B8111CA2576350020903D3E1179147BC310BACA257635001F2BEF |archivedate=4 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A feed-in tariff scheme was originally announced on 7 May 2008 which had been described by environment groups as ineffective, as the then proposed 2&amp;nbsp;kW cap on array size, combined with net metering, meant that very little surplus power would be put into the grid so very little of the high tariff would actually be paid.  Environment groups and renewable energy companies called for the Victorian feed-in tariff to be paid on gross metering with a 10&amp;nbsp;kW cap on array size to overcome these problems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.envict.org.au/inform.php?item=1797 Brumby Government’s solar feed-in law a flop], Environment Victoria, 5 May 2008  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024125952/http://www.envict.org.au/inform.php?item=1797 |date=24 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/environment/government-attacked-on-solar-tariff-plan-20090316-8zww.html# "Government attacked on solar tariff plan"], David Rood and Royce Millar, [[The Age]], 17 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but these concerns were only partially addressed in the 2009 scheme.

On 1 September 2011, it was announced that the 60 cent tariff would be closed to new installations after 30 September 2011 after 88,000 installations, and a new Transitional tariff of at least 25 cents would apply to systems installed afterwards. The Transitional tariff will be paid until the end of 2016, when tariffs will be reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energyandresources.vic.gov.au/energy/environment-and-community/victorian-feed-in-tariff/closed-schemes/maintaining-eligibility Maintaining eligibility for the Premium Feed-in Tariff,  Transitional Feed-in Tariff, or "one-for-one" Standard Feed-in Tariff]&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum feed-in tariff that applies to new applicants from 1 January 2016 was 5 cents per kilowatt hour (c/kWh).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energyandresources.vic.gov.au/energy/environment-and-community/victorian-feed-in-tariff Victorian Feed-in Tariff]&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum feed-in tariff that applies to new applicants from 1 July 2017 is 11.3 cents per kilowatt hour (c/kWh). This is broken down as follows.
Feed-in tariff component.
Forecast solar-weighted average wholesale electricity pool cost - 8.1 (c/kWh).
Value of avoided distribution and transmission losses - 0.6 (c/kWh).
Avoided market fees and ancillary service charges - 0.1 (c/kWh).
Value of avoided social cost of carbon - 2.5 (c/kWh).
FiT - 11.3 (c/kWh).

From 1 July 2018 the minimum electricity feed-in tariff for households and businesses who feed power back into the electricity grid from small renewable energy sources will be 9.9 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh). This is broken down as follows. Feed-in tariff component. Forecast solar-weighted average wholesale electricity pool cost - 6.8 (c/kWh). Value of avoided distribution and transmission losses - 0.5 (c/kWh). Avoided market fees and ancillary service charges - 0.1 (c/kWh). Value of avoided social cost of carbon - 2.5 (c/kWh). FiT - 9.9 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh). For the first time, retailers will be able pay solar system owners either a single-rate tariff or time-varying tariff. The single rate tariff is 9.9 cents per kilowatt hour. Under the time-varying tariff, customers will be credited between 7.1 cents and 29.0 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity exported, depending on the time of day.

===Tasmania===
On Tuesday, 3 March 2008, the Premier of Tasmania announced that the Government will consider a mid-year report on the introduction of minimum feed-in tariffs to support householders and small energy consumers using solar panels and other forms of domestic renewable energy and that provide surplus energy into the electricity grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpac.tas.gov.au/divisions/policy/climate/ Department of Premier and Cabinet - Policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506114659/http://www.dpac.tas.gov.au/divisions/policy/climate/ |date=6 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern Territory===
Northern Territory is yet to make an announcement on feed-in tariffs as a means of subsidising and encouraging solar PV, other than in relation to Alice Springs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ata.org.au/feedintariffs/take-action-nt/ Alternative Technology Association website » Take action NT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123232011/http://www.ata.org.au/feedintariffs/take-action-nt/ |date=23 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 there was a bid to make Alice Springs a Solar City. Australian Government funding would give four different regions in Australia the chance to become a Solar City and share $75 m funding to make solar power projects a reality. If successful, the Alice Springs project would involve solar power generation plus investigating energy efficiency, [[smart meter]]ing and tariff pricing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nt.gov.au/business/documents/general/2006_Industry_Sector_Snapshots.pdf NT Industry Sector Snapshots 2006]. Page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alice Springs, an official Solar City, from May 2008 people with grid connected PV systems can sell all the solar electricity they generate back to Power and Water Corporation at 45 cents per kilowatt–hour, which is more than double the cost of purchasing electricity from the grid.&lt;ref&gt;(12 May 2008).

Outside of the Alice Springs Solar City area, people with Solar PV in the NT can arrange to sell their gross electricity production to the Power &amp; Water Corporation of the Northern Territory at 14.38c. They can effectively use the grid as a bank and notionally re-purchase the electricity at night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerwater.com.au/powerwater/business/photovoltaic_rebate.html Power and Water Corporation - Solar Energy Buyback Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720074558/http://www.powerwater.com.au/powerwater/business/photovoltaic_rebate.html |date=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nt.gov.au/dpifm/Minerals_Energy/MakeTheSwitch/index.cfm?header=Roof-top%20solar%20panels Make the Switch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303221404/http://www.nt.gov.au/dpifm/Minerals_Energy/MakeTheSwitch/index.cfm?header=Roof-top%20solar%20panels |date=3 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity retailers==
Some electricity retailers are offering feed in tariff rates above the minimum stipulated by government. Many of the larger corporate retailers offer these incentives to capture larger proportions of the green electricity customer base, who are known to have lower churn rates.

==Council of Australian Governments==
According to the [[COAG]] communiqué released in November 2008 [[COAG]] agreed to a set of national principles to apply to new feed-in tariff schemes and to inform the reviews of existing schemes. These principles will promote national consistency of schemes across Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Ju Yeon Jung (1 December 2008).

# Micro renewable generation to receive fair and reasonable value for exported energy
# Any premium rate to be jurisdictionally determined, transitional and considered for public funding
# Ministerial Council for Energy (MCE) to continue to advance fair treatment of small renewables
# FiT policy to be consistent with previous [[COAG]] agreements (particularly the Australian Energy Market Agreement)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coag.gov.au/coag_meeting_outcomes/2008-11-29/docs/20081129_national_principles_fits.pdf Council of Australian Governments meeting, Canberra, 29 November 2008 - National Principles for Feed-in Tariff Schemes]&lt;/ref&gt;

These principles do not appear to support a gross feed in tariff as exists in Germany, but rather a net feed in tariff.

==Opposition to feed-in tariffs==
A Bill for a national feed-in tariff introduced by Senator Milne has not progressed after the Rudd government indicated it would not support such legislation. Some reasons were provided through the majority report of a Senate Committee examining the Bill. In the ACT, in February 2010, the ACT Independent Competition and Regulatory Commission proposed reducing the amount paid to RE generators under the Territory's FIT law.

It has been reported that NSW households could pay an extra $600 on their electricity bill over six years ($8.33/month) to cover the $2 billion cost of the tariff scheme. The total cost to families in some regional areas could be $1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/energy-smart/solar-flareup-will-burn-a-hole-in-every-pocket-20101030-17862.html | title=Solar flare-up will burn a hole in every pocket | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because YSZ requires operating temperatures of 800–1000&amp;nbsp;°C to achieve maximal ionic conductivity, the associated energy and costs make GDC a more optimal (even "irreplaceable",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publica.fraunhofer.de/dokumente/N-163378.html |title=Publica |publisher=Publica.fraunhofer.de |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to researchers from the [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer Institute]]) material for commercially viable SOFCs.

==Structure and properties==
Oxygen vacancies are created when [[gadolinium]] (a trivalent cation) is introduced into ceria (CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with Ce in the 4+ oxidation state) or on reduction in CO or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The high concentration and mobility of the oxide ion vacancies results in a high ionic conductivity in this material. In addition to its high ionic conductivity CGO is an attractive alternative to YSZ as an electrolyte due to low reactivity and good [[chemical compatibility]] with many mixed conducting [[cathode material]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Garche, Jurgen. et al., ed. Encyclopedia of Electrochemical Power Sources. Oxford: Newnes, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Dopant levels of Gd typically range from 10% to 20%. The majority of [[SOFC]] researchers and manufacturers still favor the use of YSZ over CGO due to YSZ having superior strength and because CGO will reduce at high temperature when exposed to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or CO.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A '''glidant''' is a substance that is added to a [[Powder (substance)|powder]] to improve its [[flowability]]. A glidant will only work at a certain range of [[concentration]]s. Above a certain concentration, the glidant will in fact function to inhibit flowability.

In [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] manufacture, glidants are usually added just prior to compression.

==Examples==
Examples of glidants include [[magnesium stearate]], [[fumed silica]] (colloidal silicon dioxide), [[starch]] and [[talc]].&lt;ref name=SMI&gt;{{cite web|title=SMI: Talc as a Glidant &amp; Lubricant|url=http://www.specialtyminerals.com/specialty-applications/specialty-markets-for-minerals/nutritional-supplements/talc-as-a-glidant-lubricant/|publisher=2012 Specialty Minerals Inc.|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
A glidant's effect is due to the counter-action of factors that cause poor flowability of powders. For instance, correcting surface irregularity, reducing interparticular friction and decreasing surface charge. The result is a decrease in the [[angle of repose]] which is an indication of an enhanced powder's flowability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7385">'''Inga alley cropping''' refers to planting agricultural crops between rows of [[Inga trees]].  It has been promoted by Mike Hands.&lt;ref&gt;David Adam, ''[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/nov/28/climatechange.climatechangeenvironment Earthshakers: the top 100 green campaigners of all time]'' The Guardian, 28 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the [[Inga tree]] for [[alley cropping]] has been proposed as an alternative to the much more ecologically destructive [[slash and burn cultivation]].&lt;ref name=Elkan&gt;Elkan, Daniel. ''Slash-and-burn farming has become a major threat to the world's rainforest'' [[The Guardian]] 21 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The technique has been found to increase yields. It is [[sustainable agriculture]] as it allows the same plot to be cultivated over and over again thus eliminating the need for [[slash and burn|burning of the rainforests]] to get fertile plots.

==Inga tree==
[[File:Inga Flowers.JPG|300px|thumb|right|The flower of an [[Inga]] tree.]]

{{main|Inga}} 
Inga trees are native to many parts of [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. Inga grows well on the [[acid soils]] of the [[tropical rainforest]] and former rainforest. They are [[leguminous]] and [[Nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] into a form usable by plants.&lt;ref name=RFS&gt;rainforestsaver.org: [http://www.rainforestsaver.org/what-inga-alley-cropping What is Inga alley cropping?]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mycorrhiza]] growing within the roots ([[arbuscular mycorrhiza]]) was found to take up spare phosphorus, allowing it to be recycled into the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Guinness, Bunny. ''A "miracle cure"'' [[The Sunday Telegraph]] 5 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Other benefits of Inga include the fact that it is fast growing with thick leaves which, when left on the ground after pruning, form a thick cover that protects both soil and roots from the sun and heavy rain. It branches out to form a thick canopy so as to cut off light from the weeds below and withstands careful pruning year after year.&lt;ref name=RFS/&gt;

==History==
The technique was first developed and trialled by tropical ecologist Mike Hands in Costa Rica in the late 1980s and early '90s. [[Research funding]] from the [[EEC]] allowed him to experiment with species of Inga. Although alley cropping had been widely researched, it was thought that the tough [[pinnate]] leaves of the Inga tree would not decompose quickly enough.&lt;ref name=Elkan/&gt;

As the crops grow, so does the Inga.  When the crops are harvested the Inga is allowed to grow back.  Once more it closes the [[canopy (biology)|canopy]], is pruned, and the cycle is repeated, time and again. Leaves pruned from the tree decompose on the ground releasing phosphorus for crops.  Fungi take up phosphorus to repeat the cycle.

[[Image:Jhum.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The effects of slash-and-burn agriculture on primary forest, such as seen in this picture, can be devastating. Inga alley cropping may be a solution.]]

Using this system, not only do the farmers grow their basic crops of [[maize]] and [[beans]], but also [[cash crops]].  Previously this was not possible because when the plot was a distance from the farmer's home, consistent guarding and tending could be too challenging. Now with the same plot being used continuously, it can be near home, thus allowing an entire family to  help to tend and guard it, even when there are young children.

The Inga is used as hedges and pruned when large enough to provide a mulch in which bean and corn seeds are planted. This results in both improving [[crop yields]] and the retention of [[soil fertility]] on the plot that is being farmed. Hands had seen the devastating consequences that are caused by slash and burn agriculture while working in Honduras; this new technique seemed to offer the solution to the environmental and economic problems faced by so many slash and burn farmers.

Although this technique has the potential to save rainforest and lift many out of poverty, Inga alley cropping has not yet reached its full potential, although the charity Inga Foundation, headed by Mike Hands, has been consulted about potential projects in Haiti ( which is almost completely deforested) and the Congo. Discussions have also been mooted about projects in Peru and Madagascar.

==Method==

For Inga alley cropping the trees are planted in rows (hedges) close together, with a gap, the alley, of about 4m between the rows. An initial application of [[rock phosphate]] has kept the system going for many years.

When the trees have grown, usually in about two years, the canopies close over the alley and cut off the light and so smother the [[weed]]s.

The trees are then carefully pruned.  The larger branches are used for [[firewood]]. The smaller branches and leaves are left on the ground in the alleys. These rot down into a good [[mulch]] ([[compost]]). If any weeds haven't been killed off by lack of light the mulch smothers them.

The farmer then pokes holes into the mulch and plants their crops into the holes.

The crops grow, fed by the mulch. The crops feed on the lower layers while the latest prunings form a protective layer over the soil and roots, shielding them from both the hot sun and heavy rain.  This makes it possible for the roots of both the crops and the trees to stay to a considerable extent in the top layer of soil and the mulch, thus benefiting from the food in the mulch, and escaping [[Pest (organism)|soil pests]] and [[Leaching model (soil)|toxic minerals]] lower down. [[Pruning]] the Inga also makes its [[root]]s die back, thus reducing competition with the crops.

==Mike Hands==
Mike Hands is a former academic researcher, current UK farmer and environmentalist, who pioneered the research into Inga alley cropping and currently promotes the concept through the Inga Foundation, a UK registered charity he founded in 2007 to support projects in Central and South America.

When the UK [[Environment Agency]] listed the "all-time" "scientists, campaigners, writers, economists and naturalists" who, in its view, have done the most to save the planet, Hands was placed 44th, just below [[Andrew Lees (environmentalist)|Andrew Lees]], and one place above German politician and activist, [[Petra Kelly]].&lt;ref&gt;David Adam,''[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/nov/28/climatechange.climatechangeenvironment Earthshakers: the top 100 green campaigners of all time]'' The Guardian, 28 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Benjamin Dancer''' (8 October 1812 – 24 November 1887) was a British scientific instrument maker and inventor of [[microphotography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hallett|first1=Michael|editor1-last=Henisch|editor1-first=Heinz|title=John Benjamin Dancer 1812–1887: a perspective|journal=History of Photography, an international quarterly|date=July–September 1986|volume=10|issue=3|pages=237–255|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd.|issn=0308-7298}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also pioneered [[stereography]]. By 1835, he controlled his father's instrument making business in Liverpool. He was responsible for various [[invention]]s, but did not patent many of his ideas. In 1856, he invented the stereoscopic camera (GB patent 2064/1856).&lt;ref name="office1857"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bennett Woodcroft|title=Chronological index of patents applied for and patents granted for the year 1856|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L7dzFhUqKD0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:aw9gsHdgNN4C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Eo6pU8L9DuSS1AXW-4DoCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dancer&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 June 2014|year=1857|publisher=George Edward Eyre and William Spottiswoode, Printers to the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at the age of 75 and was buried at Brooklands Cemetery, [[Sale, Greater Manchester]].

Dancer improved the [[Daniell cell]] by introducing the porous pot cell, which he invented in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Watt, Arnold Philip, ''Electroplating and Electrorefining of Metals'', pp.91–92, Watchmaker Publishing, 2005 {{ISBN|1-929148-45-3}} (originally published 1889).&lt;/ref&gt; He was a leading inventor and practitioner in the emerging field of microphotography, work he began shortly after the Daguerreotype process was first announced in 1839.  His novel uses of microphotography, such as "the reduction of the 680 word tablet erected in memory of the electrician William Sturgeon to a positive one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter", attracted much public attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Solbert|editor1-first=Oscar N.|editor2-last=Newhall|editor2-first=Beaumont|editor3-last=Card|editor3-first=James G.|title=John Benjamin Dancer (1812-1887)|journal=Image, Journal of Photography of George Eastman House|date=November 1952|volume=1|issue=8|page=2|url=http://image.eastmanhouse.org/files/GEH_1952_01_08.pdf|accessdate=26 June 2014|publisher=International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House Inc.|location=Rochester, N.Y.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909224010/http://image.eastmanhouse.org/files/GEH_1952_01_08.pdf|archivedate=9 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dancer was remembered as a person very willing to share his expertise with others.

The '''Lincoln Navigator''' is a [[full-size]] [[luxury SUV]] marketed and sold by the [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]] brand of [[Ford Motor Company]] since the 1998 model year. Sold primarily in North America, the Navigator is the Lincoln counterpart of the [[Ford Expedition]]. While not the longest vehicle ever sold by the brand, it is the heaviest production Lincoln ever built. It is also the Lincoln with the greatest cargo capacity and the first non-limousine Lincoln to offer seating for more than six people.

The Lincoln Navigator was the first Lincoln (aside from the [[Lincoln Versailles]]) to be produced in a factory outside the [[Wixom Assembly Plant]] since 1958.  From 1997 to 2009, production was sourced at the [[Michigan Assembly Plant]] in [[Wayne, Michigan]]. Since 2007, production has also been sourced from the [[Kentucky Truck Assembly|Kentucky Truck Plant]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].

== Background ==
At the end of the 1980s, in the United States, sport-utility vehicles gradually began to transition from dedicated off-road vehicles towards dedicated family vehicles, similar to station wagons.  In 1991, the [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Jeep Grand Wagoneer]] ended its 28-year production run.  However, by the time of its discontinuation, the vehicle had gained a famous reputation for its high content, featuring the same content as a luxury sedan.  Following its official entry into the United States in 1987, the [[Range Rover Classic|Range Rover]] was upgraded in trim corresponding with its higher price.

As a response, General Motors introduced the [[Oldsmobile Bravada]] in 1991, convincing several other manufacturers to introduce mid-size luxury SUVs. As full-size SUVs such as the [[Chevrolet Suburban]] and [[Ford Expedition]] are highly profitable vehicles, the Lincoln Navigator came to life.

The Lincoln Navigator was launched on July 1, 1997 for the 1998 model year, with the first vehicle rolling off the assembly line on May 14, 1997.&lt;ref name="theautochannel.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/press/date/19970514/press002443.html|title=Lincoln Navigator Rolls Out With Large Order Bank|date=May 14, 1997|accessdate=2009-02-28|work=theautochannel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/date/19970610/news003273.html|title=Lincoln Navigator (1998) Debuts Sans Jackie Stewart.|date=June 10, 1997|work=The Auto Channel|author=Maloney, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based directly on the [[Ford Expedition]], introduced the year before, the Navigator gave the Lincoln-Mercury division its first full-size SUV (slotted above the Ford Explorer-based [[Mercury Mountaineer]]).

In its first calendar year of sales (1998), Navigator contributed to an unprecedented event of recent decades – the overtaking of the Lincoln brand by perennial rival [[Cadillac#Competition with Lincoln - Escalade|Cadillac]] in annual sales volume. Initially, published figures indicated that Cadillac had outsold Lincoln by a scant 222 vehicles sold, thanks to an enormous surge in Cadillac Escalade sales in December 1998, from hundreds in previous months to almost 5,000. A subsequent audit resulted in a retraction/apology in May 1999, attributing the "error" to "overzealous" "low-level" employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/06/business/fi-34467|title=Cadillac Apologizes to Lincoln for Inflating Sales Numbers – Los Angeles Times|last=O'Dell|first=John|date=1999-05-06|publisher=Articles.latimes.com|accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chassis ===
The Lincoln Navigator was also developed under the Ford program code name UN173, with the Expedition developed under the UN93 program code name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/frankquenneville|title=Frank Quenneville|date=|publisher=LinkedIn|accessdate=2010-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A full-size body-on-frame vehicle, the Navigator was mechanically related to the Ford Expedition; both vehicles were related to the [[Ford F-Series tenth generation|1997 Ford F-Series]]. The Navigator featured independent front suspension (short-long arm/SLA); the rear suspension was of a live rear axle design. Using an optional feature from its Ford counterpart, the Navigator was designed with load-leveling [[air suspension]]; tuned primarily for ride comfort, the air suspension lowered itself when the vehicle was parked.

Although technically available with rear-wheel drive, the primary drivetrain on the Lincoln Navigator was [[ControlTrac]], a computer-controlled automatic four-wheel drive system. As with the Expedition, the Navigator was fitted with four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes.

Using the same 230&amp;nbsp;hp 5.4L Triton V8 as the Expedition/F-150 paired with the 4-speed 4R100 automatic transmission, the 1998 Lincoln Navigator came with a towing capacity of {{convert|7700|lb||0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, Jeff. "One-Year Test Verdict: 1998 Lincoln Navigator." ''Motor Trend''. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; During 1999, Lincoln would fit two different engines in the Navigator in an effort to better match full-size SUVs from General Motors. At the beginning of the model year, the Triton V8 was upgraded to 260&amp;nbsp;hp; as a running change during the model year, Lincoln would replace the SOHC Triton with a 300&amp;nbsp;hp DOHC 5.4L V8, named InTech (borrowing a name from the Mark VIII).  Due to the increase in power, towing capacity would increase to over {{convert|8500|lb|abbr=on}}.

=== Body ===
Although the Lincoln Navigator shares the same bodyshell as the Ford Expedition, giving it a similar exterior appearance, Lincoln stylists would make many design changes to differentiate the two vehicles.  Forward of the windshield, the Lincoln Navigator shares no body panels with its Ford counterpart, with its own front fascia (a grille design shared with the 1998 Lincoln Town Car and the 2000 Lincoln LS), wheels, roof rack, lower body trim, and taillights.  The interior of the two vehicles shared more commonality, with the dashboard common to both vehicles (with greater use of wood trim); the Navigator was given its own seat design.  To make for a quieter interior over the Expedition and Ford F-Series, the Navigator made greater use of sound deadening materials and higher-quality carpeting.

The Lincoln Navigator included standard features available or optional on the Expedition, including power driver and passenger bucket seats, 2nd-row bucket seats (with a 2nd-row bench seat as a delete option), floor consoles, and keyless entry.  The few options available included a power moonroof, a universal garage door opener, 7 seven to 8 eight passenger seating an electrochromic rearview mirror (filtering out headlight glare from vehicles seen in the mirror), and a premium audio system (a seven speaker, 290-Watt audio system with a 6-disc front console-mounted CD-changer, and rear seat audio controls), and 17-inch alloy wheels.&lt;ref&gt;"1998 Lincoln Navigator Review." The Car Connection. 2008. http://www.thecarconnection.com/fullreview/lincoln_navigator_1998&lt;/ref&gt;

During its production run, Lincoln made few changes to the first-generation Navigator.  In 1999, alongside the addition of the InTech V8, power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedals were added; the previously optional 17-inch wheels became standard.

For 2000, the fender-mounted radio antenna was integrated into the right-rear window, while the interior received  ''Nudo'' leather seating surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/products/model.cfm?vehicle_id=19 |title=2000 Navigator Overview |year=2000 |publisher=Ford Motor Company |work=Ford Media |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104143838/http://media.ford.com/products/model.cfm?vehicle_id=19 |archivedate=2005-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The options list expanded to include a satellite navigation system, heated and cooled front seats, a reverse-sensing system, and side-impact [[airbag]]s.

For 2001, several minor cosmetic changes were made.  On the grille and tailgate, the Lincoln emblem was given a black background (replacing the previous red); on the tailgate, the Lincoln and Navigator badging switched sides. A [[VHS|VHS-based]] video entertainment system became an option.

For 2003, a number of changes and improvements were made to the Navigator thanks to a thorough redesign. The Navigator continued to share a platform with the [[Ford Expedition]], which was also redesigned for 2003, but continued to differ from it in terms of styling and various upscale features. The 2003 redesign featured a thoroughly revised exterior, the first since the Navigator's launch, with only the front doors and roof panel unchanged from the previous generation. The new exterior came with things such as a larger chrome waterfall grille, brighter quad-beam headlights with larger housings, revised chrome door handles set in color-keyed bezels, and slightly wider running boards. Inside the Navigator was an all-new instrument panel and dashboard area which, significantly, was not shared with the Expedition. Inspired by the symmetrical, "dual-cockpit" layout of the 1961 [[Lincoln Continental]], the instrument panel and dashboard area was adorned with real walnut burl wood inserts and panels and switches painted with a low-luster satin nickel color. Adding to the upscale interior design further were white [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]], 120 in all, which provided backlighting for controls and switches. Additionally, to direct attention to the high-quality satin nickel-faced [[analog clock]] mounted in the dashboard, an articulating door is present to conceal the radio head unit and optional satellite navigation system when they are not in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Ford Motor Company |work=Ford Media |title=2003 Lincoln Navigator – Distinctive Design, Incomparable Luxury |year=2003 |url=http://media.ford.com/products/presskit_display.cfm?vehicle_id=644&amp;press_subsection_id=420&amp;make_id=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Highlighting the Navigator's design changes were other new features and options for 2003. Newly available features like Ford's ''Safety Canopy'' side curtain airbags and a tire pressure monitoring system improved occupant safety. Convenience was enhanced by the availability of power running boards (an industry first), power-folding third row seats, a power liftgate, and [[High-intensity discharge lamp|HID headlights]] (for top end models). The available rear-seat video entertainment system was updated to be [[DVD|DVD-based]] and all Navigators now came with standard 18x7.5-inch alloy wheels with 18x8-inch chrome wheels available as an option.

Like the redesigned 2003 Expedition (U222), the Navigator benefited from a reworked chassis, new [[rack and pinion|rack-and-pinion]] steering, and an all-new [[independent suspension|independent rear suspension]] (IRS), which brought better handling and ride comfort. The Navigator continued to benefit from a load-leveling air suspension but it now lowered the vehicle by an inch when stopped in the interest of easing entry and exit. The Navigator's powertrain was modified from the UN173, but the 5.4&amp;nbsp;L DOHC V8 used before was no longer advertised under the InTech name. But it now produced {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5500 rpm and {{convert|355|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 3750 rpm Due to changes brought with the redesign, the Navigator's base curb weight increased to {{convert|5760|lb||0|abbr=on}} in two-wheel drive models and nearly {{convert|6000|lb|abbr=on}} in four-wheel drive models. In turn, towing capacity dropped slightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Ford Motor Company |work=Ford Media |title=2003 Navigator Specifications |year=2003 |url=http://media.ford.com/products/presskit_display.cfm?vehicle_id=644&amp;press_section_id=398&amp;make_id=93 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tire-pressure monitoring was made standard for 2004 while Ford's ''AdvanceTrac'', a type of [[traction control system]], with [[Electronic stability control|Roll Stability Control]] was an option. In 2004, for 2005 the Navigator received a minor facelift with new square-shaped foglights replacing the circular ones used previously. AdvanceTrac with RSC was now standard while HID headlights were available on all models. In the interest of cost effectiveness, the 5.4&amp;nbsp;L DOHC V8 introduced in the 1999 model year was replaced by the same [[Ford Modular engine#5.4|5.4&amp;nbsp;L 3-valve SOHC V8]] that had been available in the [[Ford F-Series|F-150]] since the 2004 model year. Though having a different head design, the new engine offered similar overall output, producing {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5000&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|365|lbft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque at 3750&amp;nbsp;rpm. The new engine was not marketed under the ''Triton'' name in the Navigator even though it is mechanically identical to the F-150's engine. The 4R75W 4-speed automatic transmission used from 2003 until 2004 was replaced with a new [[ZF Friedrichshafen AG|ZF]]-sourced 6-speed automatic transmission. The 2005 Navigator's base curb weight fell to {{convert|5555|lb||0|abbr=on}} while four-wheel drive models dropped to {{convert|5842|lb||0|abbr=on}}. Towing capacity increased slightly over the previous model year to {{convert|8600|lb||0|abbr=on}} in two-wheel drive models and {{convert|8300|lb||0|abbr=on}} in four-wheel drive models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ford Motor Company |work=Ford Media |title=2005 Navigator Specifications |year=2005 |url=http://media.ford.com/products/presskit_display.cfm?vehicle_id=1112&amp;press_section_id=398&amp;make_id=93 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119100520/http://media.ford.com/products/presskit_display.cfm?vehicle_id=1112&amp;press_section_id=398&amp;make_id=93 |archivedate=2005-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2006, an ''Elite'' package for the ''Ultimate'' trim level was made available, including a DVD-based satellite navigation system with a voice-activated touch screen, [[THX]] audio system, rear-seat DVD entertainment system, and HID headlights.

The Navigator was redesigned under the U326 program code name, with new styling and mechanical features for 2007. Unveiled at the [[Chicago Auto Show]] in February 2006, the Navigator featured its most distinctive styling update since its introduction with new front and rear fascias and side cladding. In the front was a large, upper chrome grille resembling those of classic Lincolns like the 1963 [[Lincoln Continental|Continental]], an all-new, more complex headlight design, a lower chrome grille with integrated foglights, and a more prominent "power dome" hood. Elsewhere, an updated rear fascia featured taillights inspired by the [[Lincoln Zephyr/MKZ|Lincoln MKZ]] and chrome trim was more prominently used along the Navigator's sides, including chrome lower body molding on the doors. The distinctiveness of the Navigator's exterior followed into the interior, highlighted by an all-new dashboard and instrument panel. These areas saw an extensive use of rectangular shapes, such as in the gauges, as well as greater use of real wood and satin nickel accents.

Accompanying the Navigator's redesign for 2007 was a new model, the '''Navigator L''' developed under the U418 program code name. Comparable to the [[Cadillac Escalade|Cadillac Escalade ESV]], the Navigator L is {{convert|14.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} longer than the standard Navigator on a {{convert|12|in|mm|0|abbr=on|sing=on}} longer wheelbase, increasing its cargo capacity. The Navigator L was introduced parallel to the Expedition EL, an extended version of the [[Ford Expedition]]. Both the Navigator and Expedition were redesigned for 2007 and based on Ford's [[Ford T platform|T1 platform]], which is related to the same platform that the 2004+ [[Ford F-Series|F-150]] is based on. Compared to the Navigator's previous platform, the new platform provides greater rigidity for better driving dynamics. The [[independent suspension|independent rear suspension]] has been replaced with a new five-link IRS design to further enhance handling and ride quality. The Navigator continued to come with standard 18-inch alloy wheels but both 20- and 22-inch wheels are now available. The [[Ford Modular engine|5.4&amp;nbsp;L 3-valve SOHC V8]] introduced in the 2005 Navigator remained unchanged for 2007. The [[ZF Friedrichshafen]] 6-speed automatic transmission was replaced by Ford's own 6-speed design, the [[Ford 6R transmission|6R80]] for the 2009 model year. Due to the Navigator's redesign, its base curb weight increased to {{convert|5872|lb|abbr=on}} in two-wheel drive models and {{convert|6070|lb||0|abbr=on}} in four-wheel drive models. Navigator L models were even heavier at {{convert|5963|lb|abbr=on}} in two-wheel drive models and {{convert|6221|lb|abbr=on}} in four-wheel drive models. In spite of this, thanks to their improved frame, the Navigator's towing capacity increased for 2007, approaching {{convert|9000|lb|abbr=on}} in two-wheel drive models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ford Motor Company |work=Ford Media |title=2007 Navigator Overview |year=2007 |url=http://media.ford.com/products/presskit_display.cfm?vehicle_id=1379&amp;press_subsection_id=421&amp;make_id=93 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810120358/http://media.ford.com/products/presskit_display.cfm?vehicle_id=1379&amp;press_subsection_id=421&amp;make_id=93 |archivedate=2007-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 2007 model redesign, the Navigator no longer uses the same [[transfer case]] as the Expedition. Expedition four-wheel drives continue to use a two-speed dual range transfer case with off-road low range [[reduction gearing]] and default off-road program that [[Engine control unit|remaps]] (reprograms) the [[electronic throttle control]] and [[traction control system]] response for off-road conditions. Navigator four-wheel drives have been demoted to a light-duty one-speed single range transfer case which lacks low range gearing.

For 2008, packaging for the Navigator's luxury and convenience features was simplified, resulting in the elimination of the perennial ''Luxury'' and ''Ultimate'' trim levels and the standardization of a number of features that were previously optional. Some of these newly standard features included heated and cooled front seats, power-folding third row seats, a power liftgate, and a 600-Watt 14-speaker [[THX]] II-Certified audio system. Also newly standard was a 3.31:1 rear axle ratio, though a 3.73:1 ratio was still available as option for the Navigator and remained standard in the Navigator L. Newly available was a rearview camera to aid in backing up.

For 2009, the Navigator's 5.4&amp;nbsp;L V8 gained {{convert|10|hp|kW|abbr=on}} as well as [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|flex-fuel]] capability. The rearview camera that was new for 2008 was now standard, as were heated second row seats, ''Front Park Assist'', a capless fuel filler, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and [[Ford Sync|Lincoln SYNC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Ford Motor Company |work=Ford Media |title=2008 Navigator Overview |year=2008 |url=http://media.ford.com/products/presskit_display.cfm?vehicle_id=1947&amp;press_subsection_id=421&amp;make_id=93 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third generation Navigator and Navigator L continued to be offered for the 2010 model year, with only slight changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mehta, Sajeev |title=Review: 2010 Lincoln Navigator L |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/contents/20090508/review-lincoln-navigator-l.htm |work=ibautos.com |publisher=International Business Times |date=May 8, 2009 |accessdate=2009-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621075420/http://www.ibtimes.com/contents/20090508/review-lincoln-navigator-l.htm |archivedate=June 21, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2011, both the Navigator and the Navigator L feature [[HD Radio]], Sirius TravelLink, and Lincoln SYNC as standard on all trims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carversation.com/2010/06/29/2011-lincoln-navigator/ 2011 Lincoln Navigator] from carversation.com (July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2013 model year, the only changes made to the Navigator were the addition of new color trims: Kodiak Brown Metallic Tri-Coat, Midnight Sapphire Metallic, and Ruby Red Metallic Tinted Clearcoat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.lincoln.com/images/10031/2013_Navigator.pdf 2013 Lincoln Navigator]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from media.lincoln.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 model year was a carryover from 2013 with the same features and no cosmetic changes. This would be the last model year that it would feature the front grille fascias.

===2015 refresh===
[[File:Lincoln-Navigator-L.jpg|thumb|Refreshed 2015 Lincoln Navigator]]
In March 2013, Ford had confirmed reports that the next generation Lincoln Navigator would not be a repackaged Ford Expedition as the previous generations were, despite trailing the MKX in terms of sales but ahead of the MKT, but hopes to make it more competitive in the luxury SUV segment as they prepare to take on the [[Cadillac Escalade]], [[Infiniti QX80]], and the [[Mercedes-Benz GL-Class]], each of which had already or would launch new generations within 2013 or 2014,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wot.motortrend.com/lincoln-navigator-to-drop-v8-for-ecoboost-v6-expedition-may-get-v6-and-v8-340245.html#axzz2Z2rAGoU4 "Lincoln Navigator to Drop V-8 for EcoBoost V-6, Expedition May Get V-6 and V-8"] from Motor Trend (March 11, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and would be designed by the new Lincoln design team that also designed the new 2013 MKZ. It would be completely new and would feature the 3.5 [[Ecoboost]], new interior and exterior and performance upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2013/03/12/next-lincoln-navigator-to-drop-v8-in-favor-of-v6-but-ford-exped/ "Next Lincoln Navigator to drop V8 in favor of V6, but Ford Expedition might get both"] from Autoblog (March 12, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; But in May 2013 a prototype Navigator with a different front grille was tested featuring the EcoBoost in preparation for the updated Navigator,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wot.motortrend.com/caught-lincoln-navigator-prototype-spied-343857.html#axzz2Z2rAGoU4 "Caught: Lincoln Navigator Prototype Spied"] from Motor Trend (May 20, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by more spy shots taken in September 2013 that was sporting Lincoln's updated signature front grille.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trucktrend.com/future/spied/163_news130918_2015_lincoln_navigator_spied_testing/ 2015 Lincoln Navigator Spied Testing On Public Roads] From Truck Trend (September 18, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 2014, three photos of the 2015 Navigator were released on [[Twitter]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/CliffordAtiyeh/statuses/426072162370609153 from Twitter] posted January 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Instagram]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://instagram.com/p/jdSIKSomIn/ From Lincoln Motor Co.] posted January 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; along with an announcement that the refreshed SUV would be revealed at the [[Washington Auto Show]] the following day (January 23, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/kicking-tires/post/2015-lincoln-navigator-first-look/2014/01/23/828bff9c-83ec-11e3-a273-6ffd9cf9f4ba_blog.html "2015 Lincoln Navigator: First Look"] from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (January 23, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; However, hours after the leaks were made public, Lincoln held a press event in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] for the vehicle&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/article/20140123/BUSINESS0102/301230027/Ford-2015-Lincoln-Navigator-Expedition-auto "2015 Lincoln Navigator gets new look"] from ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' (January 23, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; and revealed the updated Navigator earlier than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6licT8RkQY|title=2015 Lincoln Navigator SUV|first=|last=Carscoops|date=22 January 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 Navigator and Navigator L kept the same exterior styling design as the Expedition instead of the reported repackaging that was announced earlier by Ford. However, it now featured an updated front grille with the rear tailgate lights bearing a resemblance to the [[Dodge Durango]]. The EcoBoost V6 engine is the only engine offered for the 2015 model year and makes {{Convert|380|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|460|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The exterior included HID headlamps with LED running lights and full LED taillights. Twenty-inch wheels came standard, replacing the 18-inch wheels, while a reserve package featured 22-inch wheels. The dashboard panels features MyLincoln Touch with Sync as a standard and controlled through an eight-inch, touchscreen display in the dash, and home to twin 4.2-inch displays that flank a central speedometer, falling in line with the rest of the Lincoln models. The push-button start became standard, likewise a passive entry and a rear-view camera. The blind-spot monitoring was added as an optional feature.

Both the refreshened and redesigned Navigator and Navigator L went into production in the Summer of 2014, and arrived to dealers in the fall of 2014 as a 2015 model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/01/23/2015-lincoln-navigator-redesign-ecoboost-v6/ "2015 Lincoln Navigator puts on a brave face, offers EcoBoost V6 only"] from Autoblog (January 23, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carscoops.com/2014/01/2015-lincoln-navigator-teased-debuts-on.html "2015 Lincoln Navigator Teased, Debuts on Thursday, Gets 3.5L V6 EcoBoost"] from Carscoops (January 22, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bsda.jpg|left|Lincoln Navigator Concept at the [[Greater Los Angeles Auto Show|2016 LA Auto Show]].|thumb]]
[[File:2018 Lincoln Navigator, rear left.jpg|left|thumb|Rear view]]

On April 12, 2017, the fourth-generation 2018 Lincoln Navigator was introduced at the [[New York International Auto Show#2017|2017 New York Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carscoops.com/2017/04/watch-out-escalade-lincoln-teases-all.html|title=Watch Out Escalade: Lincoln Teases All-New 2018 Navigator Ahead Of NY Show|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   As with previous generations, the fourth-generation remains the Lincoln counterpart of the Ford Expedition, offered in both a standard and long-wheelbase configuration (Lincoln Navigator L).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.autonews.com/article/20170412/OEM04/304129982/lincolns-2018-navigator-lighter-faster-and-more-spacious "Lincoln's 2018 Navigator lighter, faster and more spacious"] from Automotive News (April 12, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;  As before, both two and four-wheel drive versions are offered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

The fourth generation marked a significant shift in the exterior styling of the Navigator, as it adopted styling features of the 2017 Lincoln Continental.  In another major shift, the model line adopted aluminum body construction.  

=== Chassis ===
The fourth-generation Lincoln Navigator uses the [[Ford T platform#T3|Ford T3 platform]], developed under the U554 code name.  Retaining body-on-frame construction, the Lincoln Navigator (and Ford Expedition) were engineered alongside the [[Ford F-Series (thirteenth generation)|2015 Ford F-150]].  The four-wheel independent suspension configuration was retained, with a redesigned rear suspension layout.  

Shared with the Ford F-150 Raptor, the Lincoln Navigator is equipped with a 450 hp twin-turbocharged [[Ford EcoBoost engine#3.5-L (second generation)|3.5L EcoBoost V6]] (although Lincoln has ended its use of the EcoBoost nomenclature).  The highest-output engine ever sold by Lincoln, the 3.5L V6 is paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission (replacing the previous 6-speed automatic).

=== Body ===
Entering production with only minor changes from the Lincoln Navigator concept vehicle shown at the [[New York International Auto Show#2016|2016 New York Auto Show]] (removing the [[Gull-wing door|gullwing doors]] and stair-style running boards, used largely for display purposes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/lincoln-navigator-concept/42460/ "Lincoln Navigator SUV concept opens wide in New York"] from Gizmag (March 23, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;).  The 2018 Lincoln Navigator adopted several design features from the 2017 Lincoln Continental, including the style of its headlights, taillights, side vents, and its front fascia, with a large rectangular grille and a centered Lincoln star emblem.  While sharing its roofline and side doors with the Ford Expedition, in the style of [[Range Rover|Range Rovers]], the B, C, and D-pillars are blacked out for a "floating roof" effect.  

As with the 2015 Ford F-150, the body of fourth-generation Lincoln Navigator (and Ford Expedition) was designed as a part of a shift to aluminum body construction, with the use of steel largely reserved for the chassis frame rails.  Nearly 200 pounds lighter than the previous generation, the fourth-generation Navigator is physically larger than its predecessor, with the standard-wheelbase configuration gaining three inches in wheelbase, while the long-wheelbase L gaining nearly an inch (becoming the longest-wheelbase Lincoln ever produced excluding the Mark LT pickup).  In terms of body length, both versions were shortened approximately half an inch.  

Shared with the Lincoln Continental, the dashboard of the 2018 Lincoln Navigator replaced a conventional console (or column)-mounted shifter with dashboard-mounted buttons and paddle shifters.  For the first time in the model line, the fourth-generation Navigator offers a head-up display along with a 12-inch reconfigurable instrument cluster.

=== Trim ===
The fourth-generation Lincoln Navigator continues the same trim line introduced in the 2015 model update, with Premiere (new to the Navigator for 2018) as the standard trim, Select as the mid-level trim, and Reserve as the highest trim level.  

Alongside the revival of the Continental, the fourth-generation Navigator marked the debut of the Lincoln Black Label series.  A series of vehicles with interiors and exteriors coordinated around a theme (similar to the Designer Series Lincolns and Continentals of the 1970s and 1980s), the Navigator is sold with three Black Label themes: Chalet, Destination, and Yacht Club.  

At a base price of approximately $95,000, the Black Label edition of the Lincoln Navigator is the most expensive vehicle ever sold by Ford Motor Company (with the exception of the [[Ford GT]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1111150_2018-lincoln-navigator-destination-still-all-about-the-journey "2018 Lincoln Navigator Destination still all about the journey"] from The Car Connection (June 21, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
On January 14, 2018, The Lincoln Navigator was awarded Truck of the Year at the 2018 [[North American International Auto Show]], marking the first time that a Lincoln vehicle has been given a NAIAS award, as well as the first American-built Luxury Sport Utility Vehicle in this segment to win in this category.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/mark-phelan/2018/01/15/lincoln-navigator-truck-year-detroit-auto-show/1033464001/ “Is 2018 Lincoln Navigator really a truck?

Mink oil is a source of [[palmitoleic acid]], which possesses physical properties similar to human [[sebum]]. Because of this, mink oil is used in several medical and cosmetic products.  Mink oil is also used for treating, conditioning and preserving nearly all kinds of [[leather]].

Botanical alternatives to mink oil as a source of palmitoleic acid include [[macadamia]] nut oil (''Macadamia integrifolia'') and [[sea buckthorn]] oil (''Hippophae rhamnoides''), both of which contain as much or more palmitoleic acid (17% and 19–29% respectively) than does mink oil (17%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3123/2|title=Nuts, macadamia nuts, raw Nutrition Facts &amp; Calories|website=www.nutritiondata.com|access-date=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/book/10.1139/9780660190075|title=Sea Buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.)|last=T.S.C.

"Mink oil and its fatty acids are unique among animal-derived fats and oils. The total unsaturated fatty acids in mink oil account for more than 75% of the fatty acid content, but the oil, nevertheless, has a greater oxidative stability (resistance to rancidity)... than other animal or vegetable oils."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/4038995/description.html US Patent 4038995 - Hair treating composition containing a mink oil fatty acid quaternary ammonium salt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704202000/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/4038995/description.html |date=2009-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In automotive design, a '''nolder''' is a small [[aerodynamic]] shape (a strip, wing, protrusion, lip or profile) integral to bodywork or to an aerodynamic attachment&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; e.g., a [[Spoiler (car)|spoiler]], [[Diffuser (automotive)|diffuser]] or [[Diffuser (automotive)#splitters|splitter]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; perpendicular to the direction of air flow travel&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Aerodynamics, the war on winglets: a race against the wind
  | publisher = Gpone.com
  | author = Paolo Scalera 
  | date = February 17, 2017
  | quote = Very soon, in addition to internal spoilers, we will begin to talk about ‘nolders’: these are short and thin flaps placed at the ends of the spoiler output in a position roughly perpendicular to the flow. It is a small strip placed at its maximum inclination and it allows Cz to be significantly increased when the winglets have limited dimensions.
  |url = https://www.gpone.com/en/blog/paolo-scalera/2017021738501/aerodynamics-the-war-on-winglets-a-race-against-the-wind.html?refresh_ce}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the purpose of further managing and refining air flow.  

Nolders are used in both high-performance as well as in less critical aerodynamic applications. 

==Etymology==
In 1996, ''[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]'' attributed original use of the term to [[Ferrari]],&lt;ref name="autocar"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Autocar, Volume 209
  | publisher = Haymarket Motoring Pub., 1996
  | author =  
  | date = 
  | quote = Then you discover the driving position is close to flawless. No offset pedals, no unreadable gauges, a gorgeous airbag steering wheel that moves in and out, up and down, and terrific visibility, especially to the rear - although it's impossible to see the aerodynamic lip ( Ferrari calls it a nolder, a term we've not heard before ) at the extreme of the tail.
  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-0hWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=nolder+ferrari&amp;dq=nolder+ferrari&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjilYzK4djYAhVU-WMKHcviDmkQ6AEIKzAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; with other sources citing the nolder as having derived from [[Formula One|Formula One Racing]],&lt;ref name="fromf1"&gt;{{cite web
  | title =Ferrari 360 Spider
  | publisher = Scuderia Ferrari Club Parma
  | author =  
  | date = 
  | quote = Per raggiungere questo carico verticale era stato inserito un nolder (una protuberanza montata in prossimità dell’angolo di coda, soluzione ripresa dalla Formula1).
  |url = http://scuderiaferrariclubparma.it/autodelclub/ferrari-360-spider.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Ferrari has been prominent.

The ''Formula One Dictionary'' defines a nolder as "a small upside-down L-shaped aerodynamic appendage generally positioned on the trailing edge of the rear wing to increase downforce at low speed."&lt;ref name="def1"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Dizionario della F1
  | publisher = Virgilio.it
  | author =  
  | date = 
  | quote = Nolder Piccola appendice aerodinamica a forma di L rovesciata posizionata generalmente sul bordo di uscita dell'alettone posteriore. La sua funzione è quella di aumentare deportanza a bassa velocità.
  |url = http://xoomer.virgilio.it/rocmarti/Aggiornamento/F1/DizionarioF1/DizionarioF1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Automotive Dictionary'' defines it as a "very small aerodynamic appendage that fits freely into an [[aileron]] profile to increase downforce without affecting drag resistance."&lt;ref name="def2"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Il Dizionario del Automobilismo
  | publisher = Quipo.it
  | author =  
  | date = 
  | quote = Il nolder è un' appendice aerodinamica molto piccola che si inserisce liberamente ai profili degli alettoni. Aumenta l'aerodinamica ma non influisce sulla resistenza all'avanzamento.
  |url = http://utenti.quipo.it/2000GT/dizionario.htm#N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
In the design of high-performance vehicles, a nolder of limited size can significantly increase or decrease the [[lift coefficient|lift]] (Cz) of a vehicle's aerodynamic profile.&lt;ref name="ref5"/&gt; 

Nolders are also used in less high-performance applications, for example forcing an airflow separation alongside a vertical rear window to minimize debris accumulation, e.g., with a small hatchback.

==Examples==
Examples include the underside of the Ferrari [[LaFerrari]], which features a nolder to assist with vehicle dynamics.&lt;ref name="larferrari"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = LaFerrari
  | publisher = egarage.com
  | author =  
  | date = 
  | quote = The engine compartment ends in a full-width nolder beneath which is concealed an unprecedented active aerodynamic device.
  |url = http://egarage.com/current-interests/laferrari/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ferrari 599|Ferrari 599 GTO]] features prominent flanking aerodynamic fins or flying buttresses aside the rear window, maximizing air flow to a linear rear nolder.&lt;ref name="ferrari599"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Carbon Fiber Aerodynamic Fins
  | publisher = Ferrari.com
  | author =  
  | date = 
  | quote = The aerodynamic fins are the side view's most distinguishing characteristic and technically speaking, their contribution is vital for achieving the aerodynamic load goals required at high speed since they channel and maximize the air flow towards the nolder. 
   |url = http://auto.ferrari.com/en_US/wp-content/genuine-assets/en_US/P000000172_en_599_GTO_Carbon_fiber_aerodynamic_fins.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Ferrari 355]] has a similar nolder profile at the upper portion of its tail.&lt;ref name="ferrari355"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Ferrari #355
  | publisher = Drivetribe.com
  | author =  
  | date = 
  | quote = Aerodynamic designs for the car included over 1,300 hours of wind tunnel analysis. The car incorporates a Nolder profile on the upper portion of the tail, and a fairing on the underbody that generates downforce when the car is at speed. 
   |url = https://drivetribe.com/p/ferrari-f355-HSpiZTqjQ5OhfzzDZg5fgA?iid=ZGFuCS_FRH-fExmHCvjMmQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Koenigsegg CCXR]] features an optional front [[Diffuser (automotive)#splitters|splitter]] with a nolder,&lt;ref name="egg"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = CCXR Koenigsegg
  | publisher = Koenigsegg.com
  | author =  
  | date = 
  | quote = 
   |url = https://www.koenigsegg.com/ccxr/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the spoiler at the rear bumper of the [[Maserati 3200 GT#Maserati 320S|Maserati 320S]] features a supplementary nolder to increase the vertical load to the rear.&lt;ref name="maserati320s"&gt;{{cite web

  | publisher = Maserati-Alfieri
  | author =  
  | date = 
  |url = http://www.maserati-alfieri.co.uk/maser09.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For airflow management and to assist in keeping the rear window free from dirt, nolders are integral to the rearmost vertical [[Pillar (automobile)|pillar]] of [[Mini Hatch|Mini Cooper]] models and [[Fiat 500L]].&lt;ref name="500L"&gt;{{cite web

The most common fuel used in conventional [[nuclear power station|nuclear fission power stations]], [[uranium-235]] is "non-renewable" according to the [[Energy Information Administration]], the organization however is silent on the recycled [[MOX fuel]].&lt;ref name="renewalt_basics"&gt;{{cite web

In 1987, the [[Brundtland Commission]] (WCED) classified fission reactors that produce more [[fissile]] [[nuclear fuel]] than they consume ([[breeder reactor]]s, and if developed, [[fusion power]]) among conventional renewable energy sources, such as [[Sun|solar]] and [[Hydropower|falling water]].&lt;ref name="Brundtland"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 7: Energy: Choices for Environment and Development|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-07.htm|work=Our Common Future: Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development|first=Gro Harlem|last=Brundtland|location=Oslo|date=20 March 1987|accessdate=27 March 2013|quote=Today's primary sources of energy are mainly non-renewable: natural gas, oil, coal, peat, and conventional nuclear power. There are also renewable sources, including wood, plants, dung, falling water, geothermal sources, solar, tidal, wind, and wave energy, as well as human and animal muscle-power. Nuclear reactors that produce their own fuel ('breeders') and eventually fusion reactors are also in this category}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Petroleum Institute]] likewise does not consider conventional nuclear fission as renewable, but that [[breeder reactor]] nuclear fuel is considered renewable and sustainable, and while conventional fission leads to waste streams that remain a concern for millennia, the waste from efficiently burnt up [[spent fuel]] requires a more limited storage supervision period of about thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.api.org/classroom/curricula/nonrenew-resources.cfm|title=Key Characteristics of Nonrenewable Resources|author=American Petroleum Institute|accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140519002715/http://www.stralsakerhetsmyndigheten.se/Global/Publikationer/Tidskrift/Nucleus/2007/Nucleus-4-2007.pdf pg 15 see SV/g chart, without "TRU" or trans-uranics being present, the radioactivity of the waste decays to levels similar to the original uranium ore in about 300–400 years]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/pdf/nuclearpower-ch4-9.pdf MIT spent fuel [[radioactivity]] comparison, table 4.3]&lt;/ref&gt; The monitoring and storage of [[radioactive]] waste products is also required upon the use of other renewable energy sources, such as [[geothermal energy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/radiation/tenorm/geothermal.html Geothermal Energy Production Waste.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions of renewable energy==
Renewable energy flows involve natural phenomena, which with the exception of [[tidal power]], ultimately derive their energy from the [[sun]] (a [[star lifecycle|natural fusion reactor]]) or from [[geothermal energy]], which is heat derived in greatest part from that which is generated in the earth from the [[radiogenic heat|decay of radioactive isotopes]], as the [[International Energy Agency]] explains:&lt;ref name=iea111&gt;IEA Renewable Energy Working Party (2002). ''Renewable Energy... into the mainstream'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly. In its various forms, it derives directly from the sun, or from heat generated deep within the earth. Included in the definition is electricity and heat generated from [[solar energy|sunlight]], [[wind]], [[marine energy|oceans]], [[hydropower]], [[biomass]], [[geothermal]] resources, and [[biofuel]]s and [[hydrogen]] derived from renewable resources.}}

Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries.&lt;ref name=iea111/&gt;

In ISO 13602-1:2002, a renewable resource is defined as "a natural resource for which the ratio of the creation of the natural resource to the output of that resource from nature to the [[Novel ecosystem|technosphere]] is equal to or greater than one".

==Conventional fission, breeder reactors as renewable==
[[Nuclear fission]] reactors are a natural energy phenomenon, having naturally formed on earth in times past, for example a [[natural nuclear fission reactor]] which ran for thousands of years in present-day Oklo [[Gabon]] was discovered in the 1970s. It ran for a few hundred thousand years, averaging 100 [[Watt#Kilowatt|kW]] of thermal power during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meshik |first=A. P. |authorlink= |date=November 2005 |title=The Workings of an Ancient Nuclear Reactor |journal=Scientific American |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=ancient-nuclear-reactor |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gauthier-Lafaye1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gauthier-Lafaye |first=F. |authorlink= |author2=Holliger, P. |author3=Blanc, P.-L.  |year=1996 |title=Natural fission reactors in the Franceville Basin, Gabon: a review of the conditions and results of a "critical event" in a geologic system |journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta |volume=60 |issue=25 |pages=4831–4852 |doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(96)00245-1 |url= |bibcode=1996GeCoA..60.4831G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional, human manufactured, [[nuclear fission]] power stations largely use uranium, a common [[metal]] found in [[seawater]], and in rocks all over the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=nuclear_home | title=Nuclear - Energy Explained, Your Guide to Understanding Energy - Energy Information Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; as its primary source of fuel. Uranium-235 "burnt" in conventional reactors, without [[nuclear fuel cycle|fuel recycling]], is a non-renewable resource, and if used at present rates would [[uranium market|eventually be exhausted]].

[[File:BN-600 nuclear reactor.jpg|thumb|A cutaway model of the 2nd most powerful presently operating fast [[breeder reactor]] in the world. The ([[:en:BN-600|BN-600]]), at 600 [[Megawatt|MW]] of [[nameplate capacity]] is equivalent in power output to a natural gas [[combined cycle gas turbine|CCGT]]. It dispatches 560&amp;nbsp;MW to the [[Ural Mountains|Middle Urals]] [[power grid]]. Construction of a second breeder reactor, the [[BN-800 reactor]] was completed in 2014.]]

This is also somewhat similar to the situation with a commonly classified renewable source, [[geothermal energy]], a form of energy derived from the natural [[nuclear decay]] of the large, but nonetheless finite supply of uranium, [[thorium]] and [[potassium-40]] present within the Earth's crust, and due to the [[nuclear decay]] process, this renewable energy source will also eventually run out of fuel. As too will the [[Sun]], and be [[Star lifecycle|exhausted]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~infocom/The%20Website/end.html The end of the Sun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sciencemag.org/climate/2014/01/earth-wont-die-soon-thought Earth Won't Die as Soon as Thought]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear fission involving [[breeder reactor]]s, a reactor which ''[[breed]]s'' more [[fissile]] fuel than they consume and thereby has a [[Breeder reactor|breeding ratio]] for [[fissile|fissile fuel]] higher than 1  thus has a stronger case for being considered a renewable resource than conventional fission reactors. Breeder reactors would constantly replenish the available supply of [[nuclear fuel]] by converting [[fertile material]]s, such as [[uranium-238]] and [[thorium]], into fissile [[isotope]]s of [[plutonium]] or [[uranium-233]], respectively. Fertile materials are also nonrenewable, but their supply on Earth is extremely large, with a supply timeline greater than [[geothermal energy]]. In a closed [[nuclear fuel cycle]] utilizing breeder reactors, nuclear fuel could therefore be considered renewable.

In 1983, physicist [[Bernard Cohen (physicist)|Bernard Cohen]] claimed that [[breeder reactor|fast breeder reactors]], fueled exclusively by natural uranium [[Extraction of uranium from seawater|extracted from seawater]], could supply energy at least as long as the sun's expected remaining lifespan of five billion years.&lt;ref name="cohen83" /&gt; This was based on calculations involving the geological cycles of erosion, subduction, and uplift, leading to humans consuming half of the total uranium in the Earth’s crust at an annual usage rate of 6500 tonne/yr,  which was enough to produce approximately 10 times the world's 1983 [[Electric_energy_consumption#World_electricity_consumption_.282012.29|electricity consumption]],&lt;!-- or 2-3 times more than the 21,000TWh/year of energy in 2012, i.e 2.4 TW, according to [[Electric_energy_consumption#World_electricity_consumption_.282012.29]]--&gt; and would reduce the concentration of uranium in the seas by 25%, resulting in an increase in the price of uranium of less than 25%.&lt;ref name="cohen83"&gt;{{Cite journal

In 1987, the [[World Commission on Environment and Development]](WCED), an organization independent from, but created by, the [[United Nation]]s, published [[Our Common Future]], in which a particular subset of presently operating nuclear fission technologies, and [[nuclear fusion]] were both classified as renewable. That is, fission reactors that produce more [[fissile]] fuel than they consume - [[breeder reactor]]s, and when it is developed, [[fusion power]], are both classified within the same category as conventional renewable energy sources, such as [[Sun|solar]] and [[Hydropower|falling water]].&lt;ref name="Brundtland"/&gt;

Presently, as of 2014, only 2 [[breeder reactor]]s are producing industrial quantities of electricity, the [[BN-600]] and [[BN-800]]. The retired French [[Phénix]] reactor also demonstrated a greater than one [[breeder reactor|breeding ratio]] and operated for ~30 years, producing power when ''Our Common Future'' was published in 1987. 
While human sustained [[nuclear fusion]] is intended to be proven in the [[ITER|International thermonuclear experimental reactor]] between 2020 and 2030, and there are also efforts to create a [[pulsed power|pulsed]] fusion power reactor based on the [[inertial confinement]] principle (see more [[Inertial fusion power plant]]).

The squares represent relative sizes of different estimates, whereas the numbers at the lower edge give an estimate on how long the given resource would last at present U-235 consumption rates, a consumption rate based upon the unrealistic assumption that old LWR [[generation II reactor]]s will still be operating after their [[Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program|lifetimes are up]], 30 years from now, and that no [[Generation III reactors]] or [[generation IV reactors]] replace these less efficient reactors.

==Legislation in the United States==
Inclusion under the "[[renewable energy]]" classification as well as the low-carbon classification could render [[nuclear power]] projects eligible for development aid under more jurisdictions.  Thus a key issue regarding this classification of nuclear power is inclusion in [[Renewable portfolio standard]] (RES).

A bill proposed in the South Carolina Legislature in 2007-2008 aimed to classify nuclear power as renewable energy.  The bill listed as renewable energy: solar photovoltaic energy, solar thermal energy, wind power, hydroelectric, geothermal energy, tidal energy, recycling, hydrogen fuel derived from renewable resources, biomass energy, nuclear energy, and [[landfill gas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess117_2007-2008/bills/360.doc South Carolina State House, 117th Session, S. 360]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the Utah state passed the bill ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES FOR ALTERNATIVE ENERGY PROJECTS including incentives for renewable energy projects.  It includes a direct reference to nuclear power: "Renewable energy" means the energy generation as defined in Subsection 10-19-102 (11) and includes generation powered by nuclear fuel. The bill passed the house with 72 yeas, 0 nays, and 3 absent, passed the senate with 24 yeas, 1 nay, and 4 absent, then received the governor's signature.&lt;ref name="Utah House Bill 430, Session 198"/&gt;

In 2010 the [[Arizona Legislature]] included nuclear power in a proposed bill for electric utility renewable energy standards.  The bill defined "renewable energy" as energy that is renewable and non-carbon emitting.  It listed solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, hydroelectric, agricultural waste, landfill gas and nuclear sources.&lt;ref name="azleg.gov"/&gt;

In 2015 the Arizona bill specified that "Nuclear energy from sources fueled by uranium [[fuel rod]]s that include 80 percent or more of recycled nuclear fuel and natural [[thorium reactor]] resources under development" are renewable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2015/ph241/stineman1/docs/sb1134p.pdf S. Smith, "Introduced Bill: Renewable Energy; Definition," Arizona State Senate, SB 1134, January 2015. ''nuclear energy from sources fueled by uranium fuel rods that include 80 percent or more of recycled nuclear fuel and natural thorium reactor resources under development'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pumpable ice''' (''PI'') '''technology''' is a technology to produce and use fluids or secondary refrigerants, also called [[coolant]]s,  with the viscosity of water or jelly and the cooling capacity of [[ice]]. Pumpable ice is typically a slurry of ice crystals or particles ranging from 5 to 10,000 micrometers (1&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter and transported in [[brine]], [[seawater]], food liquid, or gas bubbles of [[air]], [[ozone]], or [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of pumpable slurry ice at sea|publisher=Seafood Scotland|date=May 31, 2005|url=http://www.seafoodscotland.org/images/stories/downloads/pdf/libraryOfPublications/PumpableSlurryIceKF.pdf|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=P|last2=Misson|first2=T|title=Trials of the Pumpable Icing of Fish|journal=Seafish Technology and Training|volume=105|year=2004|url=http://www.seafish.org/media/Publications/SR558.pdf|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Menin|first=Boris|title=Implementation of energy storage system for home application and small business|url=http://vk-engineering.com/articles.php?lng=en&amp;pg=6|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological process==
There are two relatively simple methods for producing pumpable ice. The first is to manufacture commonly used forms of crystal solid ice, such as plate, tube, shell or flake ice, by crushing and mixing it with water. This mixture of different ice [[concentration]]s and particle dimensions (ice crystals can vary in length from 200 [[micrometer (unit)|µm]] to 10&amp;nbsp;mm) is passed by pumps from a [[storage tank]] to the consumer. The constructions, specifications and applications of current conventional [[ice maker]]s are described in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Refrigeration|publisher=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|year=2006|chapter=Chapter 34: Ice manufacture|isbn=1-931862-87-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea behind the second method is to create the [[crystallization]] process inside of the volume of the cooled liquid. This crystallization inside can be accomplished using [[vacuum]] or cooling technologies. In vacuum technology, very low pressure forces a small part of the water to evaporate while the remaining water freezes forming a water-ice mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vacuum Ice Maker (VIM)
|url=http://www.ide-tech.com/refrigeration-and-heating/vacuum-ice-maker-vim|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the additive concentrations, the final temperature of pumpable ice is between zero and –4&amp;nbsp;°C. The large volume of vapor and an operating pressure of about 6&amp;nbsp;[[mbar]] (600&amp;nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|Pa]]) require the use of a water vapor compressor with a great [[swept volume]]. This technology is economically reasonable and can be recommended for systems with cooling capacity of 1&amp;nbsp;MW (300 [[ton of refrigeration]]; 3.5 million [[BTU/h]]) or larger.

Crystallization by cooling can be done using direct or indirect systems.

===Direct pumpable ice technology===
A [[refrigerant]] is directly injected inside the liquid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Kiatsiriroat|last2=Na Thalang|first2=K.|last3=Dabbhasuta|first3=S.|title=Ice formation around a jet stream of refrigerant|publisher=Chiang Mai University|place=Chiang Mai, Thailand|year=1999|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V2P-3XMPNC9-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1062366996&amp;_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=6d6ed3300815ec9f87ee58c733c7a97b|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantage of this method is the absence of any intermediate device between the refrigerant and the liquid. However, the absence of heat loss between refrigerant and liquid in the process of thermal interaction ([[heat transfer]]) may cause problems. The [[safety]] measures that have to be implemented, the need for the additional step of refrigerant separation, and difficulties in producing crystals are further disadvantages of this method.

===Indirect pumpable ice technology===
[[File:Pumpable Ice of high concentration.jpg|thumb|Pumpable ice of high concentration]]

In indirect methods the [[evaporator]] ([[heat exchanger]]-crystallizer) is assembled either horizontally or vertically. It has a shell tubing assembled with one to a hundred inner tubes and containing a refrigerant that evaporates between the shell and the internal tubing. Liquid flows through the tubing of the small diameter. In the inside volume of the evaporator  [[Heat transfer|cooling]], [[super cooling]] and [[freezing]] of liquid take place due to heat exchange with the crystallizer-cooled wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterdetwiler/2014/05/22/ice-storage-a-cost-efficient-way-to-cool-commercial-buildings-while-optimizing-the-power-grid/#5707ad8c1434|title=Ice Storage: A Cost-Efficient Way To Cool Commercial Buildings While Optimizing the Power Grid|first=Peter|last=Kelly-Detwiler|publisher=|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2017/05/ice-batteries-commissioned-by-utility-will-cool-california-businesses/|title=California utility augments 1,800 air conditioning units with “ice battery”|publisher=|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea is to use a well-polished evaporator surface ([[dynamic scraped surface heat exchanger]]) and appropriate mechanisms to prevent tubing from [[adhesion|adhering]] to the ice embryos, and to prevent growth and a thickening of the ice on the inside cooling surface. A whip rod, a screw or a shaft with metallic or plastic wipers is usually used as a mechanism for removal.

Indirect pumpable ice technologies produce pumpable ice consisting of 5 to 50 micrometer crystals and have a number of advantages. They can produce 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg of crystal ice at the low [[energy expenditure]] of 60 to 75&amp;nbsp;[[kWh]] instead of the 90 to 130&amp;nbsp;kWh required to produce regular water ice (plate, flake, shell types). Further improvements are expected to lead to a specific energy expenditure for ice production of 40 to 55&amp;nbsp;kWh per 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg of pure ice and a high specific ice capacity per an area value at the evaporator cooling surface (up to 450&amp;nbsp;kg/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·h)).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Menin|first1=B.|title=Calculation of Pumpable (Slurry) Ice Machine Capacity|year=2010|journal=Scientific Israel-Technological Advantages|url=http://figovsky.borfig.com/sita/12_12.aspx|accessdate=March 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328065058/http://figovsky.borfig.com/sita/12_12.aspx#|archive-date=2012-03-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial evaporators of the double-pipe type used in the food and fish industries have an inside diameter of interior tube and length, consequently, in a range of 50–125&amp;nbsp;mm and 60–300&amp;nbsp;cm. For the dewaxing lubrication oil, evaporators are widely used with the following dimensions: internal diameter of the inner tube is 150–300&amp;nbsp;mm; the length is 600–1,200&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Scraped Surface Crystallizers|url=http://www.rmarmstrong.com/rm/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=493|accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a gas can be added to the liquid flowing through the evaporator. It destroys a liquid [[laminar flow|laminar]] layer on the cooled surface of the heat exchanger-crystallizer, increases flow [[turbulence]], and decreases the average [[viscosity]] of pumpable ice.

Different liquids, such as sea water, juice, [[brine]]s, or [[glycol]] solutions of additives with more than 3–5% concentrations and a [[freezing point]] less than −2&amp;nbsp;°C are used in the process.

Typically, the equipment for the production, accumulation and supplying of pumpable ice includes an [[ice maker]], a [[storage tank]], a [[heat exchanger]], piping, pumps, and electrical and electronic appliances and devices.

Pumpable ice with maximum ice [[concentration]] of 40% can be pumped straight from the ice maker to the consumer. The final possible ice concentration of pumpable ice in the storage tank is 50%. The maximum value of cooling energy of pumpable ice accumulated in the storage tank in a [[homogeneous]] phase is about 700&amp;nbsp;kWh, which corresponds to 10&amp;ndash;15 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; volume of a storage tank. A [[high-shear mixer]] is used to prevent the separation of ice from the cooled liquid and keeps the ice concentration unchanged over time and unaffected by the tank height. Pumpable ice is transported from the storage tank to a place of consumption that could be hundreds of meters away. The practical ratio between the required [[electric power]] of the [[submersible mixer]] motor (kW) and the “kneaded” pumpable ice volume (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) is 1:1.

In the tanks with volumes larger than 15&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, pumpable ice is not mixed and the cold energy of stored ice is only used by a [[heat transfer]] of liquid that circulates between a storage tank and the consumers of cold. The disadvantages of existing ice storage reservoirs include the following:

The chaotic uncontrollable upsurge of ice ridges which arise due to uneven sprinkling of warm fluid. This liquid is fed into the storage tank from the heat exchanger for further cooling by direct contact with the surface of the ice. The solution is sprayed unevenly in space. Moreover, the rate of supply is not constant. Therefore, the ice melts unevenly. Thus, the ice spikes rise above the ice surface, which leads to the destruction of the spraying devices. In this case, it is necessary to reduce the level of solution in the storage tank to avoid breakage of spray devices.

Ice accumulated in the tank turns into a large chunk. The warm liquid that comes from the [[air-conditioning system]] may generate channels through which the liquid could return to the system without being cooled. As a result, the accumulated ice is not fully utilized.

Ineffective use of the volume of the accumulation tank leads to a decrease in the achievable maximum of ice concentration and an inability to fill the entire working volume of the storage tank.

Research and development on overcoming these disadvantages is underway and is expected to lead to the mass production of cheap, reliable and efficient accumulating tanks. These tanks should ensure higher ice concentrations and allow full use of stored cold potential.

Many ice maker producers, research centers, inventors are working on pumpable ice technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Egolf|first1=P.W.|title= Ice Slurry: A promising technology |publisher=International Institute of Refrigeration |year=2004|url=http://www.iifiir.org/ClientBookLine/recherche/NoticesDetaillees.asp?INSTANCE=EXPLOITATION&amp;iNotice=6&amp;ldebut=&amp;chkckbox23=off&amp;chk0=off&amp;chk1=off&amp;chk2=off&amp;chk3=off&amp;chk4=off&amp;chk5=off&amp;chk6=on&amp;chk7=off&amp;chk8=off&amp;chk9=off&amp;DISPLAYMENU=&amp;IDTEZO=&amp;IDTEZOBASE=&amp;IDTEZOFORM|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Rivet|first1=P.|title= Ice Slurries: State of the Art |publisher= International Institute of Refrigeration |year=2007|url=http://www.iifiir.org/ClientBookLine/recherche/executerRechercheProgress.asp?PORTAL_ID=&amp;STAXON=&amp;LTAXON=&amp;IDCAT=&amp;INSTANCE=EXPLOITATION&amp;lDebut=15&amp;chkckbox23=off&amp;chk0=off&amp;chk1=off&amp;chk2=off&amp;chk3=off&amp;chk4=off&amp;chk5=off&amp;chk6=off&amp;chk7=off&amp;chk8=off&amp;chk9=off&amp;chk10=off&amp;chk11=off&amp;chk12=off&amp;chk13=off&amp;chk14=off&amp;DISPLAYMENU=&amp;IDTEZO=&amp;IDTEZOBASE=&amp;IDTEZOFORM|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their high energy efficiency, reduced size and low refrigerant charges, there are many applications for this technology.

===Selection===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
There are different pumpable ice maker designs and many special areas of application. The choice is facilitated by computer programs developed by manufacturers.

A customer who intends to use pumpable ice technology should know:
* Required maximum/minimum cooling capacity (TR)
* Profile of energy consumption (TR•h) of the plant over 24&amp;nbsp;h, one week, one season, and one year
* Temperature ranges of the products to be refrigerated (water, juice, liquid, food, and fish)
* Temperature conditions of the climate at the location of the customer
* Design limitations on equipment placement
* Characteristics of the power supply system
* Intentions and plans of future expansion
 
When designing storage tanks, several features are to be taken into account:
* Target of usage of PIT system: Applying pumpable ice for direct contact with a refrigerated product requires the installation of storage tanks with a mixer.  To prevail over the tendency of ice to freeze in an iceberg form and to pump ice through the pipes over a distance of 100&amp;nbsp;m to 200&amp;nbsp;m, continuous mixing must be used.  For pumpable ice applications in thermal energy storage systems, mixing is not needed.   
* Available space: To determine the type of construction (vertical or horizontal ) and the number of storage tanks, site dimensions and permissible heights must be considered.
* Required daily and weekly stored energy: The cost of the storage tanks is a significant factor in the total cost of a pumpable ice system. Typically, storage tanks are designed with a stored energy value 10–20% higher than that required for production. Furthermore, it has to be remembered that 100% ice concentration in the tank is impossible.

The thickness of the wall of the evaporators is usually determined to ensure:
* High sustainable heat transfer flux during the process
* Tensile strength of the inside pipe adequate to withstand the external pressure
* Tensile strength of the outside pipe adequate to withstand internal pressure
* Enough room for corrosion
* Availability of spare parts

Evaporators are usually cheaper when they have a smaller shell diameter and a long pipe length. Thus, the evaporator of pumpable ice makers is typically as long as physically possible whilst not exceeding production capabilities. However, there are many limitations, including the space available at the customer site where the pumpable ice maker is going to be used.

===Maintenance and service===
A pumpable ice maker has predictive maintenance and cleaning requirements. Operational conditions of the specific equipment determine the service intervals and types of service.

Proper refrigeration maintenance of a pumpable ice maker will extend its life, and routine maintenance can reduce the probability of an emergency service caused by major component failure, such as of a refrigeration compressor or the fan motor of the air condenser due to a dirty coil, and refrigerant leakage.

Possible problems caused by not maintaining the air-cooled pumpable ice maker are:
* Failure of fan motors caused by dirty coils restricting air flow
* Failure of the thermostat caused by high amp draw due to dirty condenser coils
* Failure of refrigeration compressor caused by dirty condenser coil and excessive head pressure
* Restriction of [[capillary tubing]] (metering device) caused by refrigerant oil overheating and fouling
* Wiring burning and failure due to excessive amperage caused by high head pressure and dirty condenser coils
* Increased electrical consumption due to longer-run times caused by dirty condenser coils
* Pollution and blockage of the line of condensate water.

In the pumpable ice maker liquid treatment is used to remove particles down to 1&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] in size and to minimize fouling of the heat transfer surface of the evaporators. Plate heat exchangers also need to be disassembled and cleaned periodically. Properly treating liquid before it enters the pumpable ice maker or the [[Plate heat exchanger]] will help to limit the amount of scale build-up, thus reducing cleaning times and  preventative maintenance costs. Improperly sizing the liquid filter system leads to costly early change outs and poor performance.

===Wastewater treatment===
Pumpable ice technologies can be recommended for cleaning (lightening) [[sediment]]s in waste waters. In this case, a method including [[freezing]] and further [[melting]] with subsequent separation of the liquid and solid phases is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|inventor1-last=Lyubarsky|inventor1-first=Vladlen|inventor2-last=Fomin|inventor2-first=Nikolai|inventor3-last=Kravtzov|inventor3-first=Genady|inventor4-last=Menin|inventor4-first=Boris|title=Plant for treatment of sediment of natural and wastewaters|issue-date=1988|patent-number=4786407|country-code=US|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method leads to a variation in the physical-chemical structure of sediments and is realized owing to redistribution of any form of the connection of moisture with solid particles of the sediment. It does not need any chemical reagent. The sediment's freezing promotes an increase in the free water quantity of the sediment and improves the efficiency of sediment precipitation. Most of the moisture is capable of diffusion at any of the conditions. Therefore, if the velocity of crystal growing does not exceed 0.02&amp;nbsp;m/h, there is time for moisture to migrate from colloid cells to the crystal surface, where it is frozen. After thawing, lightened water can be used for industrial and agriculture applications. The concentrated sediments are supplied to press-filters to further decrease their moisture content.

===Desalination of seawater===
{{further|Desalination}}
The existing commercialized desalination methods are multi-stage [[flash evaporation]], vapor-compression, multi-effect evaporation, reverse osmosis and [[electrodialysis]]. Theoretically, freezing has some advantages over the above-mentioned methods. They include a lower theoretical energy requirement, minimal potential for [[corrosion]], and little scaling or [[precipitating]]. The disadvantage is that freezing involves a handling of ice and water mixtures that is mechanically complicated, both as to moving and processing. A small number of desalination stations have been built over the last 50 years, but the process has not been a commercial success in the production of freshwater for municipal purposes. Pumpable ice machines offer an affordable alternative because of the high efficient crystallization process. Current models, however, do not have the necessary capacity for industrial desalination plants, but  smaller models suffice for small-scale desalination needs.

===Processes of concentration of food liquid and juice===
Currently, [[reverse osmosis]] and vacuum-evaporation technologies are used to concentrate juices and other food liquids. In commercial operations, juice is normally concentrated by evaporation. Since 1962, the Thermally Accelerated Short Time Evaporator (TASTE) has been widely used.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} TASTE evaporators are efficient, sanitary, easy to clean, of high capacity, simple to operate, and of relatively low cost. On the other hand, there is some heat damage to the product caused by the high-temperature steam treatment. This treatment results in product quality and aroma losses. Because of the low value of the film coefficient between steam and treated juice, heat transfer between them is very inefficient. It leads to the cumbersome construction of TASTE plants. The alternative is to concentrate juice and food liquid by a cooling and freezing process. In this case crystals of pure water are removed from the [[juice]], [[wine]], or [[beer]] by crystallization. The [[aroma]], [[color]], and [[flavor]] remain in the concentrated medium. The quality of freeze-concentrated products cannot be achieved by any other technology.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The main advantages  in comparison with other freezing techniques are low [[energy expenditure]] and the possibility to tune the rate of the phase change from liquid to solid ice, which in turn increases the production of pure water ice crystals and simplifies the separation of concentrated juice or food liquid and ice crystals.

=== Production of frozen food liquids ===

In the 1990s,  [[frozen carbonated beverage]]s and frozen uncarbonated beverages began to enjoy great popularity.

The manufacture (process and refrigeration equipment) of almost all frozen carbonated beverages and frozen uncarbonated beverages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ASHRAE Handbook. Refrigeration, 20.13-20.17|location=Atlanta|publisher=American Society of heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=1-931862-87-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is organized  like the production of pumpable ice.

==== Frozen carbonated beverages ====
[[File:Frozen coke 1.jpg|thumb|Frozen Coke]]

The frozen carbonated beverage machine was invented in the late 1950s by [[Omar Knedlik]].

For frozen carbonated beverage manufacturing, a mixture of flavored syrup, carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and filtered water are used. Typically, the initial temperature of the mixture is 12–18&amp;nbsp;°C. The carbonated mixture is fed into the evaporator of the apparatus, then freezes on the inner surface of the cylindrical evaporator and is scraped off by the blades—mixers rotating at 60 to 200&amp;nbsp;rpm. In the internal volume of the crystallizer, a slight positive pressure (up to 3 bar) is maintained to improve the dissolution of gas into the liquid. In modern frozen carbonated beverage devices, there is a conventional refrigeration circuit with a capillary tube or thermostatic expansion valve and, usually, an air [[condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]]. Refrigerant is fed either directly into the cavity of a two-wall evaporator or into the spiral evaporator wound on the outer surface of the crystallizer. The evaporator wall is made of stainless steel grade SS316L, approved for contact with food according to requirements of the US [[Food and Drug Administration]]. The evaporator temperature is −32 to −20&amp;nbsp;°C. Manufacturers do not reveal the hourly capacity of frozen carbonated beverages machines, but the energy expenditure to produce 10.0&amp;nbsp;kg of frozen carbonated beverages can be 1.5–2.0&amp;nbsp;kWh.

After mixing and freezing in the crystallizer-mixer, the frozen carbonated beverage is ejected through the nozzle into cups. The end product is a thick mixture of suspended ice crystals with a relatively small amount of liquid. Frozen carbonated beverage quality depends on many factors, including the concentration, size and structure of the ice crystals. The concentration of the ice water mixture is determined accurately in accordance with the [[phase diagram]] of the solution and can reach 50%. The maximum crystal size  is 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm to 1.0&amp;nbsp;mm. The initial temperature of crystallization of the mixture depends on the initial concentration of ingredients in the water and lies between −2.0&amp;nbsp;°C and −0.5&amp;nbsp;°C. The final temperature of the product varies between −6.0&amp;nbsp;°C and −2.0&amp;nbsp;°C, depending on the manufacturer.

Interest in frozen carbonated beverages was noted in India. The Indian government prohibits the addition of ice produced from municipal water to beverages due to the probability of bacteriological contamination. Using a carbonated beverage in the form of frozen Coke offered a method to create an ice-chilled beverage in India.

==== Frozen uncarbonated beverages ====
[[File:Frozen orange juice 2.jpg|thumb|Frozen orange juice]]

Initially, frozen carbonated beverages were produced using fruit, vegetable juices, or drinks based on coffee, tea or yogurt. Research is being conducted on producing frozen wine and beer.

Frozen uncarbonated beverage machines differ from frozen carbonated beverage machines in that they do not require a small positive pressure to be maintained in the working volume of the evaporator, nor a source of carbon dioxide gas, nor specially trained staff. Otherwise, the design of modern frozen uncarbonated beverage machines is similar to that for frozen carbonated beverages. Frozen uncarbonated beverages often have a lower concentration of ice, and more liquid water, than frozen carbonated beverages. Frozen uncarbonated beverages machines are less complicated and cheaper than frozen carbonated beverage devices, making them more common.

==== Ice cream ====
The [[ice cream]] production market steadily increased throughout the 1990s and its value is multibillions of US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Berry|first1=D.|title=Market Update. Trends in Sales and Innovations|publisher=International Dairy Foods Association|year=2009|url=http://www.idfa.org/files/ic-tech_2009_berry.pdf|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eight major ice cream markets in the world are USA, China, Japan, Germany, Italy, Russia, France and UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global ice cream industry – strategic market,international trade &amp; production review|publisher=Dairymark.com|date=February 1, 2008|url=http://www.dairymark.com/pdf/icecream.pdf|accessdate=March 9, 2012|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key competitors in the industry are [[Unilever]] and [[Nestle]], who together control over one-third of the market. The top five ice-cream consuming countries are the US, New Zealand, Denmark, Australia and Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is the World's Largest Ice Cream Manufacturer?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-worlds-largest-ice-cream-manufacturer.htm|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern design of industrial ice cream freezers ensures a high level of machine/operator interface and top quality of the produced ice cream.
The manufacturing process of ice cream production includes pasteurization, homogenization and maturation of the ice cream mixture. The prepared mixture enters into the industrial double tube scraped crystallizer – heat exchanger, in which the processes of pre-freezing and churning of ice cream are carried out. A refrigerant fluid evaporates and continually circulates in a vessel jacket.
Usually, the initial temperature of an ice cream mixture is 12–18&amp;nbsp;°C. After switching on a freezer, an evaporating temperature of a refrigerant decreases down to a range from  −25 to −32&amp;nbsp;°C. The final temperature of  the treated mixture into the scraped surface freezer is about −5&amp;nbsp;°C, with an ice concentration of approximately 30–50%, depending on the formula. During the freezing process ice crystals form on the inside cool surface of the crystallizer wall. They are removed by blades, mixed into the bulk, and continue to decrease its temperature and to improve heat transfer within the product.

There are also rotating dashers that help to whip the mix and incorporate air into the mixture. The frozen product then goes to the distributor.

The quality of ice cream and its smooth texture depend on the structure of their ice crystals and their dimensions, and on the viscosity of the ice cream. Water freezes out of a liquid in its pure form as ice. The concentration of the remaining liquid sugar mixture increases due to water removal, hence the [[freezing point]] is further lowered. Thus the structure of ice cream can be described as a partly frozen foam with ice crystals and air bubbles occupying most of the space. Tiny fat globules flocculate  and surround the air bubbles in the form of a dispersed phase. Proteins and emulsifiers in turn surround the fat globules. The continuous phase consists of a concentrated, unfrozen liquid of sugars.

The final average diameter of ice crystals depends on the rate of freezing. The faster this is, the more [[nucleation]] is promoted and the greater the number of small ice crystals. Usually, after a cooling treatment ice crystal dimensions in the freezer are about 35–80&amp;nbsp;µm.

===Fishery and food industry===

Pumpable-ice-technology-based equipment can be used in the cooling processes in the [[fishery]] and food industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fikiin K.A., Wang Ming-Jian, Kauffeld M. and Hansen T.M.

Pumpable ice flows like water and eliminates freeze burns and physical damage to the cooled object; it increases food quality enabling a longer [[shelf life]]. Pumpable ice technology meets [[Food Safety]] and [[Public health]] regulations ([[HACCP]] and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]). Pumpable ice has a lower specific energy expenditure compared with existing technologies using conventional freshwater solid ice.

===Supermarkets===
Refrigeration systems using pumpable ice technology are attractive for the air cooling of supermarket counters (showcases).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rhiemeier|first1=Jan-Martin|first2=Jochen|last2=Harnisch|first3=Michael|last3=Kauffeld|first4=Andre|last4=Leisewitz|title=Comparative Assessment of the Climate Relevance of Supermarket Refrigeration Systems and Equipment|location=Berlin|publisher=Federal Environment Agency|year=2008|issn=1862-4359|url=http://www.umweltdaten.de/publikationen/fpdf-l/3743.pdf|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secondary loop systems for the supermarket industry|url=http://www.epa.gov/greenchill/downloads/Bohn_Secondary_Loop_WP.pdf|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this application, pumpable ice is circulated through the already available piping as a coolant, replacing environmentally unfriendly [[refrigerant]]s like [[Chlorodifluoromethane|R-22]] ([[Freon]]) and other hydro[[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (HCFC’s).
Reasons to use pumpable ice technology for this application are the following:
# Pumpable ice heat transfer rates result in compact equipment. The equipment is smaller than that of other vendors of refrigeration equipment of the same capacity. It occupies less floor area, has lower volume and weight;
# Pumpable ice structure results in substantially better parameters of this cooling medium. Greater capacities can be calculated, whether per one pass of the solution through the evaporator, per unit floor area occupied by the equipment, or per unit weight of the equipment;
# With pumpable ice technology it is easy to maintain a constant temperature inside supermarket display cases or cabinets;
# Pumpable ice technology enables the cooling system to be more flexible, so the food cabinets can be easily rearranged according to increased or decreased requirements;
# Pumpable-ice-technology-based show cabinets need less refrigeration piping, less labor to install and lower cost to find leaks in comparison with direct expansion and [[refrigerant]] pump circulation systems;
# Due to the high efficiency of pumpable ice technology, the heat transfer process takes place with a very low refrigerant charge in the cooling equipment;
# Unlike direct expansion systems, pumpable-ice-technology-based display cabinets and cases do not produce hea, since there is no need for air [[condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]]s under the cabinets. Therefore, the air around the cabinets is not heated;
# With pumpable ice technology, less energy is needed for [[defrosting]] supermarket display cases and cabinets.

===Production of ice wine===
Wide perspectives for pumpable ice usage open up for the production of special wines reminiscent of "ice wine" (German ''Eiswein'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ramim, Desert Ice (2003)|url=http://gallery.preker.co.il/israelwines-old/Amphorae-Margalit-Alexander-Vitkin-and-Zemora-Feb.2005-a-1689.html|accessdate=March 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426042220/http://gallery.preker.co.il/israelwines-old/Amphorae-Margalit-Alexander-Vitkin-and-Zemora-Feb.2005-a-1689.html#|archive-date=2012-04-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison with the existing technology for ice wine production, pumpable ice technology does not require a wait of a few months for the freezing of the [[grapes]]. Freshly squeezed grapes are harvested in a specific container connected to the pumpable ice machine. The juice is pumped through this machine, from which comes a mixture of ice (in the form of tiny, pure ice crystals) and a somewhat concentrated juice. [[Liquid ice]] returns to the accumulation tank, in which there is a natural (according to [[Archimedes law]]) separation of ice and juice. The cycle is repeated many times until the sugar concentration reaches 50–52°[[Brix]]. Then a process of [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] takes place, resulting in this alcoholic drink.

===Thermal energy storage systems===

[[File:Pumpable ice maker and storage tank installed in a basement of Cyprus Olimpic supermarket.JPG|thumb|Pumpable ice maker and storage tank installed in a basement of Cyprus Olimpic supermarket]]

A pumpable-ice-based Thermal Energy Storage System (TESS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Completion of "Environmentally Friendly Heat Source Improvement Work" at OMM Building in Osaka City|year=1998|url=http://www.takenaka.co.jp/takenaka_e/news_e/pr9804/m9804_03_e.htm|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used in centralized water-cooled air-conditioning systems in order to eliminate [[peak demand]] loads at critical times. This reduces the operating costs of buildings, the need for new [[power plant]]s and modern [[transmission line]]s, power plant energy consumption and [[pollution]], and [[greenhouse gas emissions]]. The idea is to make and accumulate pumpable ice during off-peak electricity hours with the lowest kWh tariff. The stored pumpable ice is used during middle- or high-tariff hours to cool the equipment or air supplied to the buildings. The [[return on investment]]s (ROI) takes 2–4 years. In comparison with static and dynamic ice storage systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Zhao|first1=Haihua|last2=Zhang|first2=Hongbin|last3=Sharpe|first3=Phil|last4=Hamanaka|first4=Blaise|last5=Yan|first5=Wei|last6=Jeong|first6=Woonseong|title=Ice Thermal Storage Systems for LWR Supplemental Cooling and Peak Power Shifting|date=17 June 2010|journal=Proceedings of ICAPP 10|url=http://www.inl.gov/technicalpublications/Documents/4502635.pdf|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the overall [[heat transfer coefficient]] (OHTC) during the production of pumpable ice is more than tens or hundreds of times higher (more efficient) than the same coefficient for the above-mentioned TESS types. This is explained by the presence of many different kinds of [[thermal resistance]]s between the boiling refrigerant at the evaporator and water/ice in the storage tanks of static and dynamic ice storage systems. The high OHTC value pumpable-ice-technology-based TESS means a decrease in component volume, an increase in the maximum achievable concentration of ice in the volume of a storage tank, and ultimately a decrease in the price of equipment. TESSs based on pumpable ice technology have been installed in Japan, Korea, USA, UK&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Egolf|first1=P.W.|last2=Kauffeld|first2=Michael|title=From physical properties of ice slurries to industrial ice slurry applications|location=Paris|publisher=International Institute of Refrigeration|year=2005|url=http://hepunx.rl.ac.uk/uknf/wp3/hidden/goran/bnct_lit/bin_ice/physical_properties_of_ice_slurries-industrial_applications.pdf|accessdate=October 8, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815194530/http://hepunx.rl.ac.uk/uknf/wp3/hidden/goran/bnct_lit/bin_ice/physical_properties_of_ice_slurries-industrial_applications.pdf#|archive-date=2014-08-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Mohamed|first1=W.|title= Thermal Energy Storage Using Ice Slurry |publisher= Saudi Oger Ltd |year=2008|url=http://www.slideshare.net/WahidLEEDAP/01-thermal-energy-storage-using-ice-slurry|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
A protective cooling process based on the implementation of a developed special ice slurry has been developed for medical applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Rapid Cooling Using Ice Slurries for Industrial and Medical Applications|publisher=Argonne National Laboratory|year=2010|url=http://techportal.eere.energy.gov/technology.do/techID=99|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case pumpable ice can be injected intra-arterially, intravenously, along the external surfaces of organs using laparoscopy, or even via the endotracheal tube. It is being confirmed that pumpable ice can selectively cool organs to prevent or limit ischemic damage after a stroke or heart attack. Completed medical tests on animals simulated conditions requiring in-hospital kidney laparoscopic procedures. Results of French and US research are yet to be approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Kasza|first1=K.|title=Medical Ice Slurry Coolants for Inducing Targeted-Organ/Tissue Protective Cooling|publisher= Argonne National Laboratory|year=2008|url=http://www.ne.anl.gov/capabilities/sinde/biomed/IceSlurryCooling.pdf|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Benefits of pumpable ice technology in medicinal applications are:
# Pumpable ice can be pumped easily through narrow catheters, providing high cooling capacity and rapid and targeted cooling of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]];
# Pumpable ice may provide protective cooling and temperature management of target organs during surgery;
# Pumpable ice helps victims of such medical emergencies as cardiac arrest and stroke.

===Ski resorts===
Ski resorts have a strong interest in producing snow, even when the ambient temperature is as high as 20&amp;nbsp;°C. The dimensions and power expenditure of known snow-production equipment depend on humidity and wind conditions. This snow-making equipment is based on the freezing of water droplets which are sprayed into air before they reach the ground surface, and requires an ambient temperature lower than −4&amp;nbsp;°C.

Pumpable ice produced by Vacuum Ice Maker (VIM) Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= All Weather Snowmaker|url=http://www.ide-tech.com/refrigeration-and-heating/snow-machines|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows professional skiers to increase their training periods to extend before and after winter season (into late autumn and early spring). The pumpable ice process is organized as following. A salt solution is exposed to very low pressure inside the VIM. A small part of it evaporates in the form of water due to the vacuum forces, while the remaining liquid is frozen, forming a mixture. The water vapor is continuously evacuated from the VIM, compressed, and fed into a condenser due to the special construction of the centrifugal compressor. A standard [[water chiller]] supplies cooling water at 5&amp;nbsp;°C in order to condense the water vapor. The liquid-ice mixture is pumped out from the freezing volume to the ice concentrator in which ice crystals separate from the liquid. The high concentration ice is extracted from the concentrator. VIMs have been installed at Austrian and Swiss [[ski resort]]s .

'''Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site''' ({{ko-hhrm|풍계리 핵 실험장|豊溪里 核 實驗場|context=north}}) was the only known [[nuclear test site]] of [[North Korea]].  [[Nuclear weapons testing|Nuclear tests]] were conducted at the site in [[2006 North Korean nuclear test|October 2006]], [[2009 North Korean nuclear test|May 2009]], [[2013 North Korean nuclear test|February 2013]], [[January 2016 North Korean nuclear test|January 2016]], [[September 2016 North Korean nuclear test|September 2016]], and [[2017 North Korean nuclear test|September 2017]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4806082/north-korea-nuclear-base-collapses-killing-200-radioactive-leak-fears-latest-updates/|title=KIM'S DISASTER North Korea nuclear base COLLAPSES killing at least 200 people, local reports claim, amid fears of massive radioactive leak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The site has three visible tunnel entrances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/facilities/881/ |title=Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Facility - Facilities - NTI |work=NTI: Nuclear Threat Initiative |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193551/http://www.nti.org/facilities/881/ |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on satellite imagery, its exact location is {{coord|41|16|47.87|N|129|5|10.51|E}} in mountainous terrain in [[Kilju County]], [[North Hamgyong Province]].  It is {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Mantapsan]], {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Hwasong concentration camp]] and {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of the [[Punggye-ri]] village.

In January 2013, [[Google Maps]] was updated to include various locations in North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Google Maps North Korea: Prison Camps, Nuclear Complexes Pinpointed In New Images (PHOTOS) |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/29/google-maps-north-korea-prison-camps-nuclear-complex-gulags_n_2573238.html |accessdate=20 May 2013 |newspaper=The Huffington Post |date=29 January 2013 |author=Cavan Sieczkowski |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209195946/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/29/google-maps-north-korea-prison-camps-nuclear-complex-gulags_n_2573238.html |archivedate=9 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 April 2013, it was reported that South Korea had observed activity at Punggye-ri, suggesting that a fourth nuclear test was being prepared, but the next test did not occur until January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2969782&amp;cloc=joongangdaily%7chome%7ctop |title=Activity at North’s nuke test site-INSIDE Korea JoongAng Daily |publisher=Koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com |date=8 April 2013 |accessdate=16 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417051811/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2969782&amp;cloc=joongangdaily%7Chome%7Ctop |archivedate=17 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://38north.org/2013/06/punggye062413/ |title=New Tunneling Activity at the North Korean Nuclear Test Site |author=38 North |publisher=38 North |date=25 June 2013 |accessdate=26 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701042445/http://38north.org/2013/06/punggye062413/ |archivedate=1 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 2016, North Korean state media announced a [[January 2016 North Korean nuclear test|fourth nuclear test]] had been carried out successfully at the location using a [[hydrogen bomb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britainscoldwar.uk/north-korea-claims-hydrogen-bomb-test/ |title=North Korea claims Thermonuclear Test |publisher=britainscoldwar.uk |date=6 January 2016 |accessdate=6 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107000404/http://www.britainscoldwar.uk/north-korea-claims-hydrogen-bomb-test/ |archivedate=7 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Satellite imagery]] captured for monitoring website [[38 North]] between January and April 2017 suggested that a sixth nuclear test was being prepared at the site, which was detonated on September 3, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/12/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-test.html |title=North Korea May Be Preparing Its 6th Nuclear Test |last=Davis |first=William J.

According to sources, people from the Punggye-ri nuclear test site have been banned from entering Pyongyang since the test due to the possibility of being radioactively contaminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/m/svc/article.html?contid=2017092000938 |title=

On 3 and 23 September 2017, earthquakes which seem to be collapses of tunnels were detected with magnitude of 4.1 and 3.6 respectively.&lt;ref name="USGS Punggye-ri"/&gt;  A 17 October 2017 study published by the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University suggested the most recent test had caused "substantial damage to the existing tunnel network under [[Mount Mantap]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/defense/358016-up-to-200-killed-in-north-korean-nuclear-test-site-collapse-report|title=Up to 200 killed in North Korean nuclear test site collapse: report|last=Byrnes|first=Jesse|date=2017-10-31|work=TheHill|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{Cite news|last = Ryall| first = Julian| title = Collapse at North Korea nuclear test site 'leaves 200 dead'| publisher = The Telegraph| date = 31 October 2017| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/31/collapse-north-korea-nuclear-test-site-leaves-200-dead/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October 2017, in testimony before the South Korean parliament, the director of South Korea's Meteorological Administration warned that "further tests at Punggye-ri could cause the mountain to collapse and release radioactivity into the environment."&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; Likewise, [[China|Chinese]] scientists warned that if the mountain collapsed, nuclear fallout could spread across "an entire hemisphere."&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

On 1 November 2017 Japanese TV station [[TV Asahi]] reported that according to unconfirmed reports, several underground tunnels collapsed at the test site on 10 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/10/31/fears-radiation-leak-soar-after-north-korea-nuclear-site-collapse-kills-200|title=Fears of Radiation Leak Soar After North Korea Nuclear Site Collapse Kills 200|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An initial collapse was said to have killed 100 workers, with another 100 rescuers killed in a second collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2017/10/31/north-korea-nuclear-test-may-have-caused-deadly-tunnel-collapse/|title=North Korea kills 200 North Koreans testing nukes|date=2017-10-31|work=New York Post|access-date=2017-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/north-korean-nuclear-test-site-tunnel-collapse-reportedly-kills-200-2017-10|title=A tunnel collapsed at a North Korean nuclear test site, reportedly killing 200 people|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 2018 the North Korean government announced that it would suspend nuclear tests and shut down the Punggye-ri nuclear test site.&lt;ref name="WP20180420"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fifield|first1=Anna|title=North Korea says it will suspend nuclear and missile tests, shut down test site|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/north-korean-leader-suspends-nuclear-and-missile-tests-shuts-down-test-site/2018/04/20/71ff2eea-44e7-11e8-baaf-8b3c5a3da888_story.html?noredirect=on|accessdate=22 April 2018|publisher=Washington Post|date=20  April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May 2018 it was reported that commercial satellite imagery indicated that dismantling of the facilities at the test site had begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/report-buildings-being-dismantled-at-nk-nuke-test-site/ar-AAxhu7D|title=Report: Buildings being dismantled at NK nuke test site|website=www.msn.com|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader and Supreme Commander of North Korea Kim Jong-un determined the date for the closing ceremony of Punggye-ri - 23-25 May 2018. The government of North Korea allowed a handful of international journalists (but none from South Korea) to observe the closing ceremony. Notably absent would be experts or inspectors who could study the test site at close quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/22/north-koreas-nuclear-test-site-is-blowing-up-punggye-ri-just-for-show|title=North Korea's nuclear test site: is blowing up Punggye-ri just for show?|first=Benjamin|last=Haas|date=22 May 2018|website=the Guardian|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 May 2018 foreign journalists reported that tunnels in the Punggye-ri nuclear test site had been destroyed by the North Korean government in a move to reduce regional tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44240047 | work = BBC News | title = North Korea nuclear test tunnels at Punggye-ri 'destroyed'| accessdate = 24 May 2018 | date = 24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Observation===
On October 31, 2018, Kim Min-ki, a lawmaker in South Korea's ruling Democratic Party, stated that now defunct Punggye-ri was among other nuclear and missile test sites which had been observed by officials from South Korea's National Intelligence Service and that it was now ready for planned international inspection.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/31/north-korea-reportedly-readies-nuclear-missile-sites-for-inspectors.html&lt;/ref&gt;

RCE is often used to help normalize the size of energy companies. Energy companies serve a number of customers that is typically different from the RCE value consumed by those customers. For example, an [[Local distribution company|LDC]] or [[Deregulated#Energy|ESCO]] may serve 50,000 customers but many of those can be commercial or industrial customers, so that same company can be said to serve 400,000 RCE.

[[File:Riverstone sample block.jpg|thumb|Riverstone sample block]]

'''Riverstone pebble tile''' is a [[composite material]] made up of [[marble]] pebbles or pieces of natural stone in different sizes, bound together with a transparent white or coloured [[resin]].

==Manufacture==
The material is made by adding [[resin]] to [[marble]] or [[rock (geology)|stone]] pebbles laid down on a moulding.
One side is polished and the other side is cut. As a result, the polished side becomes slightly undulating, where the resin is lower than the pebbles that come to the surface. This characteristic makes Riverstone an aesthetically pleasant floor and wall covering and substantially improves its functionality and resistance to [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]].

The surface of the stones is free of paints or resins and it is treated with a waxy water-repellent that protects the material from [[stain]]s.

==Properties==
Riverstone has technical characteristics similar to those of marble and should be treated like marble when cutting, drilling or polishing it. It can be purchased as slabs or tiles in various sizes and colours.

==Uses==
Natural stones absorb very little liquid and the resin is virtually impervious to liquids therefore Riverstone is suitable for any kind of wall and floor covering (including heated flooring) as well as kitchen worktops, vanity tops, bar fronts and tops. Riverstone is translucent and can be backlit

'''Sandwatch''' is a [[wikt:program|program]] in which children, youth and adults work together to scientifically monitor and critically evaluate the problems facing their beach [[environment (systems)|environment]]s. They then design and implement practical activities and projects to address particular issues, enhance their beach environment and build resilience to [[climate change]]. The Sandwatch approach is called MAST: Monitoring, Analysing, Sharing information, and Taking action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambers|first=Diamond|title=Sandwatch: Adapting to climate change and educating for sustainable development|date=2010|publisher=[[UNESCO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Sandwatch has mainly focused on beach environments, the program can be used on other [[ecosystem]]s, such as [[river]]s and [[stream]]s.

Sandwatch has received support for activities over the years from organisations such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the University of Puerto Rico Sea Grant College Program, among others.

==History==
In 1999, participants at an Environmental Education workshop in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] recognized the potential of using the beach environment as an outdoor classroom. The students at the [[workshop]] came up with the name Sandwatch. Since then, the program has grown to include more than 30 member countries with over 300 [[schools]] and community groups actively monitoring change in their beach environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Verkooy|first=Michelle|title=Sandwatch Database Launch Plan|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, during the first formal Sandwatch training for [[teacher]]s, the action-based design was trialed and since then Sandwatch and the MAST approach have been successfully used by teachers around the world and are often portrayed as a working example of [[education]] for sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cambers, Gillian |author2=Chapman, Grace |author3=Diamond, Paul |author4=Down, Lorna |author5=Griffith, Anthony D. |author6=Wiltshire, Winthrop |title=Teacher's guide for education for sustainable development in Caribbean|date=2008|publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the Sandwatch Manual was [[publish]]ed. In October 2010 the manual was revised to include climate change adaptation. The manual: Sandwatch: Adapting to Climate Change and Educating for Sustainable Development is available in four [[languages]] ([[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), and can be downloaded for free on the Sandwatch website, [http://www.Sandwatch.org www.Sandwatch.org].

As the program continued to grow, in 2006 a Sandwatch website and newsletter were launched. In 2008 the Sandwatch Foundation was established as an independent organization to oversee and coordinate  the program and is operated by two volunteer directors, Paul Diamond and Gillian Cambers. 
In 2013 the long-awaited Sandwatch International Database was launched in Mauritius. The database provides participating Sandwatch groups the opportunity to upload their monitoring data to a secure site. Not only does this allow for proper archiving of environmental data, but it also allow users to analyse their results, create their own charts and graphs, and communicate their findings visually with the wider community. Non-Sandwatch groups can also visit the database and view the data.

==Activities==
Each Sandwatch school or group adopts a local [[beach]] and regularly takes a series of measurements and tests of their beach using simple and readily available equipment. By measuring how the beach's [[width]], [[current (fluid)|current]]s, [[Water waves|waves]], [[water quality]] and other factors change over months and years, the teams can determine whether their beach is stable and healthy or stressed and deteriorating, and the nature of the stressors.

When a group identifies a problem it can, with the [[community]], develop a project to address and mitigate the problem or problems. Project activities include alerting [[authorities]] to potential problems such as [[water contamination]] (from [[sewage]] or [[agricultural runoff]] for example), conducting beach clean-ups, replanting [[mangroves]] or dune stabilization [[vegetation]], creating [[signage]] for proper beach use, monitoring and protecting marine [[turtle]] nesting sites, or monitoring the effects of [[coral bleaching]]. By keeping the beach and related ecosystems healthy they are made more resilient and better able to adapt to climate change.

All Sandwatch groups are encouraged to regularly post their [[data]], [[photograph]]s and other project details on the Sandwatch [[website]], as well as to contribute [[article (publishing)|article]]s and photographs to the twice-yearly [[newsletter]], The Sandwatcher.

Sandwatch representatives  are often  invited to participate in regional and international workshops and [[Academic conference|conference]]s, where they share their experiences and data and forge [[partnership]]s with similar environmental groups.

[[File:Pendulum2secondclock.gif|thumb|The second pendulum, with a period of two seconds so each swing takes one second]]
A '''seconds pendulum''' is a [[pendulum]] whose period is precisely two [[second]]s; one second for a swing in one direction and one second for the return swing, a frequency of 1/2&amp;nbsp;Hz. A pendulum is a weight suspended from a pivot so that it can swing freely.&lt;ref name="Seconds Pendulum"&gt;[http://www.roma1.infn.it/~dagos/history/sm/node3.html Seconds pendulum]&lt;/ref&gt; When a pendulum is displaced sideways from its resting equilibrium position, it is subject to a restoring force due to gravity that will accelerate it back toward the equilibrium position. When released, the restoring force combined with the pendulum's mass causes it to oscillate about the equilibrium position, swinging back and forth. The time for one complete cycle, a left swing and a right swing, is called the period. The period depends on the length of the pendulum, and also to a slight degree on its weight distribution (the moment of inertia about its own center of mass) and the amplitude (width) of the pendulum's swing.

== Seconds pendulum and timekeeping ==
[[File:Huygens clock.png|alt=|left|thumb|upright|The second pendulum clock built around 1673 by [[Christiaan Huygens]], inventor of the pendulum clock. Drawing is from his treatise ''Horologium Oscillatorium'', published 1673, Paris, and it records improvements to the mechanism that Huygens had illustrated in the 1658 publication of his invention, titled ''Horologium''. It is a weight driven clock (the weight chain is removed) with a verge escapement (K,L), with the 1 second pendulum (X) suspended on a cord (V). The large metal plate (T) in front of the pendulum cord is the first illustration of Huygens' 'cycloidal cheeks', an attempt to improve accuracy by forcing the pendulum to follow a cycloidal path, making its swing isochronous. Huygens claimed it achieved an accuracy of 10 seconds per day.]]

Time can be combined mathematically with other [[physical quantities]] to [[Formal proof|derive]] other concepts such as [[motion (physics)|motion]], [[kinetic energy]] and time-dependent [[Field (physics)|fields]].  ''[[:category:Timekeeping|Timekeeping]]'' is a complex of technological and scientific issues, and part of the foundation of ''[[recordkeeping]]''.

The pendulum clock was invented in 1656 by [[Dutch (ethnic group and nation)|Dutch]] scientist and inventor [[Christiaan Huygens]], and patented the following year.  Huygens contracted the construction of his clock designs to clockmaker [[Salomon Coster]], who actually built the clock.  Huygens was inspired by investigations of pendulums by [[Galileo Galilei]] beginning around 1602.  Galileo discovered the key property that makes pendulums useful timekeepers: [[wikt:isochronous|isochronism]], which means that the [[Frequency|period]] of swing of a pendulum is approximately the same for different sized swings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

These early clocks, due to their [[verge escapement]]s, had wide pendulum swings of 80–100°.  In his 1673 analysis of pendulums, ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'',  Huygens showed that wide swings made the pendulum inaccurate, causing its [[Frequency|period]], and thus the rate of the clock, to vary with unavoidable variations in the driving force provided by the [[movement (clockwork)|movement]].  Clockmakers' realisation that only pendulums with small swings of a few degrees are [[isochronous (horology)|isochronous]] motivated the invention of the [[anchor escapement]] around 1670, which reduced the pendulum's swing to 4–6°.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The anchor became the standard escapement used in pendulum clocks.  In addition to increased accuracy, the anchor's narrow pendulum swing allowed the clock's case to accommodate longer, slower pendulums, which needed less power and caused less wear on the movement.  The seconds pendulum (also called the Royal pendulum),  0.994 m (39.1&amp;nbsp;in) long,  in which each swing takes one second, became widely used in quality clocks.  The long narrow clocks built around these pendulums, first made by William Clement around 1680, became known as [[Longcase clock|grandfather clock]]s.  The increased accuracy resulting from these developments caused the minute hand, previously rare, to be added to clock faces beginning around 1690.&lt;ref&gt;Milham 1945, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th and 19th century wave of [[horological]] innovation that followed the invention of the pendulum brought many improvements to pendulum clocks.  The [[deadbeat escapement]] invented in 1675 by [[Richard Towneley]] and popularised by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] around 1715 in his precision "regulator" clocks gradually replaced the anchor escapement&lt;ref&gt;Milham 1945, p.181, 441&lt;/ref&gt; and is now used in most modern pendulum clocks.  Observation that pendulum clocks slowed down in summer brought the realisation that [[thermal expansion]] and contraction of the pendulum rod with changes in temperature was a source of error. This was solved by the invention of temperature-compensated pendulums; the [[mercury pendulum]] by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] in 1721 and the [[gridiron pendulum]] by [[John Harrison]] in 1726.&lt;ref&gt;Milham 1945, pp. 193–195&lt;/ref&gt;  With these improvements, by the mid-18th century precision pendulum clocks achieved accuracies of a few seconds per week.

At the time the [[second]] was defined as a fraction of the Earth's rotation time or mean solar day and determined by clocks whose precision was checked by astronomical observations.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b7300361b/f14.image|title=Mesure de la terre [par l'abbé Picard]|last=texte|first=Picard, Jean (1620-1682).

The fundamental unit of solar time is the [[day]]. Two types of solar time are apparent solar time ([[sundial]] time) and mean solar time (clock time).

[[File:Equation of time.svg|thumb|right|The equation of time—above the axis a sundial will appear ''fast'' relative to a clock showing local mean time, and below the axis a sundial will appear ''slow''.]]
Mean solar time is the hour angle of the mean Sun plus 12 hours. This 12 hour offset comes from the decision to make each day start at midnight for civil purposes whereas the hour angle or the mean sun is measured from the zenith (noon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idc-online.com/technical_references/pdfs/civil_engineering/Solar_Apparent_Time_and_Mean_Solar_Time.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-03-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328102907/http://www.idc-online.com/technical_references/pdfs/civil_engineering/Solar_Apparent_Time_and_Mean_Solar_Time.pdf |archivedate=2018-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The duration of daylight varies during the year but the length of a mean solar day is nearly constant, unlike that of an apparent solar day.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the slight changes that affect the mean solar day, see the [[ΔT]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; An apparent solar day can be 20 seconds shorter or 30 seconds longer than a mean solar day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pierpaoloricci.it/dati/giornosolarevero_eng.htm "The duration of the true solar day"]

(Italy)&lt;/ref&gt; Long or short days occur in succession, so the difference builds up until mean time is ahead of apparent time by about 14 minutes near February 6 and behind apparent time by about 16 minutes near November 3. The [[equation of time]] is this difference, which is cyclical and does not accumulate from year to year.

Mean time follows the mean sun. [[Jean Meeus]] describes the mean sun as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Consider a first fictitious Sun travelling along the ''ecliptic'' with a constant speed and coinciding with the true sun at the perigee and apogee (when the Earth is in perihelion and aphelion, respectively). Then consider a second fictitious Sun travelling along the ''celestial equator'' at a constant speed and coinciding with the first fictitious Sun at the equinoxes. This second fictitious sun is the ''mean Sun''..."&lt;ref&gt;Meeus, J. (1998). ''Astronomical Algorithms.'' 2nd ed. Richmond VA: Willmann-Bell. p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1936 French and German astronomers found that Earth rotation's speed is irregular. Since 1967 [[Atomic clock|atomic clocks]] define the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://350ans.obspm.fr/fr/exposition-virtuelle/revivre-notre-histoire|title=Revivre notre histoire {{!}} Les 350 ans de l'Observatoire de Paris|website=350ans.obspm.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For further informations see [[atomic time]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Seconds pendulum and metrology ==
The length of a seconds pendulum was determined (in [[toise]]s) by [[Marin Mersenne]] in 1644. In 1660, the [[Royal Society]] proposed that it be the standard unit of length. In 1671 [[Jean Picard]] measured this length at the [[Paris Observatory|Paris observatory]]. He found the value of 440.5 lines of the Toise of Châtelet which had been recently renewed. He proposed a universal toise (French: ''Toise universelle'') which was twice the length of the seconds pendulum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b7300361b|title=Mesure de la terre [par l'abbé Picard]|last=texte|first=Picard, Jean (1620-1682).

Griffin|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seconds pendulum and the figure of the Earth ===
[[Jean Richer]] and [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] measured the parallax of Mars between [[Paris]] and [[Cayenne]] in [[French Guiana]] when Mars was at its closest to Earth in 1672. They arrived at a figure for the solar parallax of 91/2 inches, equivalent to an Earth–Sun distance of about 22000 Earth radii. They were also the first astronomers to have access to an accurate and reliable value for the radius of Earth, which had been measured by their colleague [[Jean Picard]] in 1669 as 3269 thousand ''[[toise]]s''. Picard's geodetic observations had been confined to the determination of the magnitude of the earth considered as a sphere, but the discovery made by Jean Richer turned the attention of mathematicians to its deviation from a spherical form. The determination of the [[Figure of the Earth|figure of the earth]] became a problem of the highest importance in astronomy, inasmuch as the diameter of the earth was the unit to which all celestial distances had to be referred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/exploration-du-systeme-solaire/oclc/894499177|title=L'exploration du système solaire|last=Bond|first=Peter|last2=Dupont-Bloch|first2=Nicolas|date=2014|publisher=De Boeck|year=|isbn=9782804184964|location=Louvain-la-Neuve|pages=5-6|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://350ans.obspm.fr/fr/evenement-frise/premiere-determination-distance-terre-soleil|title=Première détermination de la distance de la Terre au Soleil {{!}} Les 350 ans de l'Observatoire de Paris|website=350ans.obspm.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adsbit.harvard.edu/full/1967LAstr..81..234G|title=1967LAstr..81..234G Page 234|website=adsbit.harvard.edu|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://clea-astro.eu/archives/web/resume.php?num_fas=100&amp;num_art=1146|title=INRP - CLEA - Archives : Fascicule N° 137, Printemps 2012 Les distances|website=clea-astro.eu|language=fr|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Newton theorized correctly that the Earth was not precisely a sphere but had an [[oblate]] [[ellipsoid]]al shape, slightly flattened at the poles due to the [[centrifugal force]] of its rotation.  Since the surface of the Earth is closer to its center at the poles than at the equator, gravity is stronger there.  Using geometric calculations, he gave a concrete argument as to the hypothetical ellipsoid shape of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principia, Book III, Proposition XIX, Problem III|last = Newton|first = Isaac|publisher =|year =|isbn =|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia]]'' was not to provide exact answer for natural phenomena, but to theorize potential solutions to these unresolved factors in science.  Newton pushed for scientists to look further into the unexplained variables. Two prominent researchers that he inspired were [[Alexis Clairaut]] and [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]]. They both sought to prove the validity of Newton's theory on the shape of the Earth. In order to do so, they went on an expedition to [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] in an attempt to accurately measure the [[meridian arc]].  From such measurements they could calculate the [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of the Earth, its degree of departure from a perfect sphere.   Clairaut confirmed that Newton's theory that the Earth was ellipsoidal was correct, but his calculations were in error, and wrote a letter to the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]] with his findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Problem of the Earth's Shape from Newton to Clairaut|last = Greenburg|first = John|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|year = 1995|isbn = 0-521-38541-5|location = New York|pages = 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society published an article in [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions]] the following year in 1737 that revealed his discovery. Clairaut showed how Newton's equations were incorrect, and did not prove an ellipsoid shape to the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Clairaut|first = Alexis|last2 = Colson|first2 = John|date = 1737|title = An Inquiry concerning the Figure of Such Planets as Revolve about an Axis, Supposing the Density Continually to Vary, from the Centre towards the Surface|jstor = 103921|journal = Philosophical Transactions|doi =|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he corrected problems with the theory, that in effect would prove Newton's theory correct. Clairaut believed that Newton had reasons for choosing the shape that he did, but he did not support it in ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia]].'' Clairaut's article did not provide a valid equation to back up his argument neither. This created much controversy in the scientific community.

It was not until Clairaut wrote ''Théorie de la figure de la terre'' in 1743 that a proper answer was provided. In it, he promulgated what is more formally known today as [[Clairaut's theorem]]. By applying Clairaut's theorem, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] found from 15 gravity values that the flattening of the Earth was 1/330. A modern estimate is 1/298.25642.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://tai.bipm.org/iers/convupdt/chapter1/icc1.pdf Table 1.1 IERS Numerical Standards (2003)])&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, one year before the [[metre]] was ultimately based on a quadrant of the Earth, [[Talleyrand]] proposed that the metre be the length of the seconds pendulum at a [[latitude]] of 45°.&lt;ref name="Seconds Pendulum" /&gt; This option, with one-third of this length defining the ''foot'', was also considered by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and others for [[Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States|redefining the yard in the United States]] shortly after gaining independence from the British Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cochrane|first=Rexmond|title=Measures for progress: a history of the National Bureau of Standards|url=http://nvl.nist.gov/nvl2.cfm?doc_id=505|year=1966|publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce|page=532|chapter=Appendix B: The metric system in the United States|access-date=2011-03-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427023306/http://nvl.nist.gov/nvl2.cfm?doc_id=505#|archive-date=2011-04-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Borda and Cassini pendulum experiment.png|thumb|upright|Drawing of pendulum experiment to determine the length of the seconds pendulum at Paris, conducted in 1792 by [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] and [[Jean-Dominique Cassini]].

It was suspended in front of the pendulum ''(B)'' of a precision clock ''(A)''.]]
Instead of the seconds pendulum method, the commission of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] – whose members included [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]], [[Gaspard Monge|Monge]] and [[Nicolas de Condorcet|Condorcet]] – decided that the new measure should be equal to one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the Equator (the [[quadrant (circle)|quadrant]] of the Earth's circumference), measured along the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] passing through Paris. Apart from the obvious consideration of safe access for French surveyors, the [[Paris meridian]] was also a sound choice for scientific reasons: a portion of the quadrant from [[Dunkirk]] to [[Barcelona]] (about 1000&amp;nbsp;km, or one-tenth of the total) could be surveyed with start- and end-points at sea level, and that portion was roughly in the middle of the quadrant, where the effects of the Earth's [[oblateness]] were expected to be the largest. The [[French Geodesic Mission|Spanish-French geodetic mission]] combined with an earlier mesurement of the [[Paris meridian]] arc and the Lapland geodetic mission had confirmed that the Earth was an oblate spheroid.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Moreover observations were made with a pendulum to determine the local acceleration due to local gravity and centrifugal acceleration; and these observations coincided with the geodetic results in proving that the Earth is flattened at the poles. The acceleration of a body near the surface of the Earth, which is measured with the seconds pendulum, is due to the combined effects of local [[gravity]] and [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal acceleration]]. The [[gravity]] diminishes with the distance from the center of the Earth while the [[centrifugal force]] augments with the distance from the axis of the Earth's rotation, it follows that the resulting acceleration towards the ground is 0.5% greater at the poles than at the Equator and that the polar diameter of the Earth is smaller than its equatorial diameter.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3047v/f1457.image.r=1880%201880|title=Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des sciences / publiés... par MM. les secrétaires perpétuels|last=texte|first=Académie des sciences (France).

The [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] planned to infer the [[flattening]] of the Earth from the length's differences between meridional portions corresponding to one [[Degree (angle)|degree]] of [[latitude]].

As the [[metre]] had to be equal to one ten-millionth of this distance, it was defined as 0.513074 [[toise]] or 3 [[Foot (unit)|feet]] and 11.296 [[Ligne|lines]] of the Toise of Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entreprises.gouv.fr/metrologie/histoire-metre|title=Histoire du mètre|work=Direction Générale des Entreprises (DGE)|access-date=2018-09-28|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Toise of Peru had been constructed in 1735 as the standard of reference in the [[French Geodesic Mission|Spanish-French Geodesic Mission]], conducted in actual Ecuador from 1735 to 1744.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] and [[François Arago]] published in 1821 their observations completing those of Delambre and Mechain. It was an account of the length's variation of the degrees of latitude along the Paris meridian as well as the account of the variation of the seconds pendulum's length along the same meridian between Shetland and the Baleares. The seconds pendulum's length is a mean to measure ''g'', the local acceleration due to local gravity and centrifugal acceleration, which varies depending on one's position on Earth (see [[Gravity of Earth|Earth's gravity]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Larousse, Pierre, ed.

[[File:Simple pendulum height.svg|thumb|left|A [[simple pendulum]] exhibits approximately simple harmonic motion under the conditions of no damping and small amplitude.]]A [[Pendulum|simple pendulum]] is an example of [[harmonic oscillator]]:

Assuming no damping, the differential equation governing a simple pendulum of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the local acceleration due to local gravity and centrifugal acceleration, is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \frac{g}{l}\sin\theta = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

If the maximal displacement of the pendulum is small, we can use the approximation &lt;math&gt;\sin\theta \approx \theta&lt;/math&gt; and instead consider the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \frac{g}{l}\theta = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The solution to this equation is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\theta(t) = \theta_0 \cos\left(\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}} t\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta_0&lt;/math&gt; is the largest angle attained by the pendulum.  The [[Sine|period]], the time for one complete oscillation, is given by the expression

:&lt;math&gt;T_0 = 2\pi \sqrt\frac{l}{g},&lt;/math&gt;

which is a good approximation of the actual period when &lt;math&gt;\theta_0&lt;/math&gt; is small.

The length of the seconds pendulum is a function of the time lapse of half a cycle &lt;math&gt;T_{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \ell=g\left(\frac{T_{1/2}}{\pi}\right)^2. &lt;/math&gt;
Being &lt;math&gt;T_{1/2}=1\ \mathrm{s}&lt;/math&gt; 
therefore &lt;math&gt;g=\ell\cdot \pi^2 \mathrm{\frac{1}{s^2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The task of surveying the Paris [[meridian arc]] took more than six years (1792–1798). The technical difficulties were not the only problems the surveyors had to face in the convulsed period of the aftermath of the Revolution: Méchain and Delambre, and later [[François Arago|Arago]], were imprisoned several times during their surveys, and Méchain died in 1804 of [[yellow fever]], which he contracted while trying to improve his original results in northern Spain. In the meantime, the commission of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] calculated a provisional value from older surveys of 443.44&amp;nbsp;''[[ligne]]s''. This value was set by legislation on 7&amp;nbsp;April 1795.&lt;ref name="NICB"&gt;{{cite book | author=National Industrial Conference Board | title=The metric versus the English system of weights and measures ... | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tSUoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA10 | accessdate=2011-04-05 | year=1921 | publisher=[[The Century Co.]] | pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Méchain and Delambre were completing their survey, the commission  had ordered a series of [[platinum]] bars to be made based on the provisional metre. When the final result was known, the bar whose length was closest to the meridional definition of the metre was selected and placed in the National Archives on 22&amp;nbsp;June 1799 (4&amp;nbsp;messidor An&amp;nbsp;VII in the [[French Republican Calendar|Republican calendar]]) as a permanent record of the result.&lt;ref name="Larousse"&gt;{{Cite LarousseXIXe | title=Métrique | volume=11 | pages=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard metre bar became known as the Committee metre (French : ''[[Mètre des Archives]]'').

=== Standards in the United States and U.S. Survey of the Coast ===
The [[Articles of Confederation]], ratified by the colonies in 1781, contained the clause, "The United States in Congress assembled shall also have the sole and exclusive right and power of regulating the alloy and value of coin struck by their own authority, or by that of the respective states—fixing the standards of weights and measures throughout the United States". Article 1, section 8, of the [[Constitution of the United States]] (1789), transferred this power to Congress; "The Congress shall have power...To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights and measures".

In January 1790, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George Washington]], in his first annual message to Congress stated that, "Uniformity in the currency, weights, and measures of the United States is an object of great importance, and will, I am persuaded, be duly attended to", and ordered [[Secretary of State]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] to prepare a [[plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States]], afterwards referred to as the Jefferson report. On October 25, 1791, Washington appealed a third time to Congress, "A uniformity of the weights and measures of the country is among the important objects submitted to you by the [[Constitution]] and if it can be derived from a standard at once invariable and universal, must be no less honorable to the public council than conducive to the public convenience".

[[File:HasslerCollection 001.jpg|thumb|upright|The beginning of the U. S. coastal survey.|left]]

The original predecessor agency of the National Geodetic Survey was the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Survey of the Coast]], created within the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] by an [[Act of Congress]] on February 10, 1807, to conduct a "Survey of the Coast."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219185106/http://www.lib.noaa.gov/noaainfo/heritage/coastandgeodeticsurvey/index.html|title=Coast and Geodetic Survey Heritage - NOAA Central Library|date=2015-12-19|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="noaa-timeline"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/legacy/time1800.html|title=NOAA History - NOAA Legacy Timeline - 1800's|website=www.history.noaa.gov|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Survey of the Coast, the [[United States government]]'s first scientific agency,&lt;ref name="noaa-timeline" /&gt; represented the interest of the [[Administration (government)#United%20States|administration]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] in science and the stimulation of international trade by using scientific [[surveying]] methods to chart the waters of the United States and make them safe for navigation. A [[Swiss people|Swiss]] immigrant with expertise in both surveying and the standardisation of [[weights and measures]], [[Ferdinand R. Hassler]], was selected to lead the Survey.&lt;ref name="noaa-heritage"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906160411/http://www.lib.noaa.gov/noaainfo/heritage/coastsurveyvol1/TITLE.html|title=Access and Use - NOAA Central Library|date=2014-09-06|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hassler submitted a plan for the survey work involving the use of [[triangulation]] to ensure scientific accuracy of surveys, but [[international relations]] prevented the new Survey of the Coast from beginning its work; the [[Embargo Act of 1807]] brought American overseas trade virtually to a halt only a month after Hassler's appointment and remained in effect until Jefferson left office in March 1809. It was not until 1811 that Jefferson's successor, President [[James Madison]], sent Hassler to [[Europe]] to purchase the instruments necessary to conduct the planned survey, as well as standardised weights and measures. Hassler departed on August 29, 1811, but eight months later, while he was in [[England]], the [[War of 1812]] broke out, forcing him to remain in Europe until its conclusion in 1815. Hassler did not return to the United States until August 16, 1815.&lt;ref name="noaa-heritage" /&gt;

The Survey finally began surveying operations in 1816, when Hassler started work in the vicinity of [[New York City]]. Preliminary baselines' measurements were undertaken in 1817.

Hassler undertook a complete investigation of the national standards in 1830, but it was not until 1838, that a uniform set of standards was worked out.

The first clear and concise exposition of the method of least squares was published by [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] in 1805.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Adrien-Marie |last=Legendre |title=Nouvelles méthodes pour la détermination des orbites des comètes |trans-title=New Methods for the Determination of the Orbits of Comets |language=French |publisher=F. Didot |location=Paris |year=1805 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Nouvelles_m%C3%A9thodes_pour_la_d%C3%A9terminati.html?id=FRcOAAAAQAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique is described as an algebraic procedure for fitting linear equations to data and Legendre demonstrates the new method by analyzing the same data as Laplace for the shape of the earth. The value of Legendre's method of least squares was immediately recognised by leading astronomers and geodesists of the time.

In 1809 [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] published his method of calculating the orbits of celestial bodies. In that work he claimed to have been in possession of the method of least squares since 1795. This naturally led to a priority dispute with Legendre. However, to Gauss's credit, he went beyond Legendre and succeeded in connecting the method of least squares with the principles of probability and to the [[normal distribution]]. He had managed to complete Laplace's program of specifying a mathematical form of the probability density for the observations, depending on a finite number of unknown parameters, and define a method of estimation that minimises the error of estimation. Gauss showed that the [[arithmetic mean]] is indeed the best estimate of the location parameter by changing both the [[probability density]] and the method of estimation. He then turned the problem around by asking what form the density should have and what method of estimation should be used to get the arithmetic mean as estimate of the location parameter. In this attempt, he invented the normal distribution.

An early demonstration of the strength of [[Gauss' method]] came when it was used to predict the future location of the newly discovered asteroid [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]. On 1 January 1801, the Italian astronomer [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] discovered Ceres and was able to track its path for 40 days before it was lost in the glare of the sun. Based on these data, astronomers desired to determine the location of Ceres after it emerged from behind the sun without solving [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's complicated nonlinear equations]] of planetary motion. The only predictions that successfully allowed Hungarian astronomer [[Franz Xaver von Zach]] to relocate Ceres were those performed by the 24-year-old Gauss using least-squares analysis.

In 1810, after reading Gauss's work, Laplace, after proving the [[central limit theorem]], used it to give a large sample justification for the method of least squares and the normal distribution. In 1822, Gauss was able to state that the least-squares approach to regression analysis is optimal in the sense that in a linear model where the errors have a mean of zero, are uncorrelated, and have equal variances, the best linear unbiased estimator of the coefficients is the least-squares estimator. This result is known as the [[Gauss–Markov theorem]].

The idea of least-squares analysis was also independently formulated by the American [[Robert Adrain]] in 1808. In the next two centuries workers in the theory of errors and in statistics found many different ways of implementing least squares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1751-5823.1998.tb00406.x |first=J. |last=Aldrich |year=1998|title=Doing Least Squares: Perspectives from Gauss and Yule |journal=International Statistical Review |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages= 61–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, the Russian Government at the instance of [[Otto Wilhelm von Struve]] invited the Governments of Belgium, France, Prussia and England to connect their triangulations in order to measure the length of an arc of parallel in latitude 52° and to test the accuracy of the figure and dimensions of the Earth, as derived from the measurements of arc of meridian. In order to combine the measurements it was necessary to compare the geodetic standards of length used in the different countries.The British Government invited those of France, Belgium, Prussia, Russia, India, Australia, Austria, Spain, United States and Cape of Good Hope to send their standards to the [[Ordnance Survey]] office in Southampton. Notably the geodetic standards of France, Spain and United States were based on the metric system, whereas those of Prussia, Belgium and Russia where calibrated against the [[toise]], of which the oldest physical representative was the [[Toise]] of Peru.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Alexander Ross|date=1867-01-01|title=X.

[[File:US National Length Meter.JPG|thumb|Closeup of [[Meter|National Prototype Metre]] Bar No. 27, made in 1889 by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) and given to the United States]] In 1861 [[Johann Jacob Baeyer]] published a report suggesting that European countries should cooperate in the determination of the [[figure of the Earth]]. In 1862, when Denmark, Saxe-Gotha, the Netherlands, Russia (for Poland), Switzerland, Baden, Saxony, Italy, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Bavaria, Mecklenburg, Hanover and Belgium decided to participate, Bessel's Toise was adopted as international geodetic standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iag-aig.org/index.php?tpl=text&amp;id_c=80&amp;id_t=143|title=A Note on the History of the IAG|website=IAG Homepage|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[39th United States Congress|Congress of 1866]] made use of the metric system in commerce a legally protected activity through the passage of [[Metric Act of 1866]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/upload/SP_447-2.pdf |title=Weights and Measures Standards of the United States a brief history |last= |first= |date= |website=ts.nist.gov|page=41, 22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026194248/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/upload/SP_447-2.pdf |archive-date=October 26, 2011 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1867 besides Russia and Portugal, Spain joined the geodetic association and was represented by [[Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero]]. He had devised a geodetic standard calibrated against the metre which had been compared to the Toise of Borda, the copy of the Toise of Peru constructed for the measurement of the Paris meridian arc by Delambre and Mechain. Copies of the Spanish metric geodetic standard were made for some of the great European countries and for Egypt. The European geodetic association (German: ''[[International Association of Geodesy|Europäische Gradmessung]]'') at its Second General Conference in 1867 called for the creation of a new, ''international prototype metre'' (IPM) and the arrangement of a system where national standards could be compared with it. The international prototype would also be a "line standard"; that is, the metre was defined as the distance between two lines marked on the bar, so avoiding the wear problems of end standards.

The French government gave practical support to the creation of an International Metre Commission, which met in Paris in 1870 and again in 1872 with the participation of about thirty countries.

Fondator of the [[Instituto Geográfico Nacional (Spain)|Spanish Geographic Institute]], [[Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero]] had collaborated with the French since 1853 on the completion of the West Europe-Africa Meridian-arc (French: ''[[Paris meridian|Meridienne de France]]''), which would then extend from [[Shetland]] to the [[Sahara]], by expanding the continental geodetic survey in [[Spain]] and by connecting Spanish and [[French Algeria|Algerian]] geodetic network over the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean sea]].

As a forerunner in Europe, Spain had adopted the [[metre]] as geodetic standard, contributed to the [[International Association of Geodesy|''Europäische Gradmessung'']]'s decision to adopt the metre and played a leading role in the fondation of the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]. Indeed [[Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero]] took part in the Committee of preparatory research from the first meeting of the International Metre Commission in 1870, became president of the permanent Committee of the International Metre Commission in 1872, represented Spain at the 1875 conference of the [[Metre Convention]] and at the first [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] in 1889 and was the first president of the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] from 1875 to 1891.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soler|first=T.|date=1997-02-10|title=A profile of General Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero: first president of the International Geodetic Association |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001900050086|journal=Journal of Geodesy |language=en |volume=71|issue=3|pages=176–188 |doi=10.1007/s001900050086 |issn=0949-7714}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cipm/former_presidents.html|title=BIPM - Presidents of the CIPM|website=www.bipm.org|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 1875, 17 out of 20 countries signed a document known as the ''Metric Convention'' or the ''Treaty of the Metre'', which established the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] under the control of an [[International Committee for Weights and Measures|international committee]] elected by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Sanders Peirce]] was instructed early in the spring of 1875 to proceed to Europe for the purpose of making pendulum experiments to chief initial stations for operations of this sort, in order to bring the determinations of the forces of gravity in America into communication with those of other parts of the world; and also for the purpose of making a careful study of the methods of pursuing these researches in the different countries of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unav.es/gep/Informe18.05.1877.html |title=''Informe de Charles S.

In 1877 [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]] attended the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; General conference of the ''Europäische Gradmessung'' in [[Stuttgart]] where he exposed his work on seconds pendulum and expressed his concern about the accuracy of gravity measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unav.es/gep/CongresoStuttgart1877.html |title=''Quinta Conferencia Geodésica Internacional Association Géodésique Internationale o Europäischen Gradmessung Stuttgart, 27 de septiembre-2 de octubre de 1877'' |last= |first= |date= |website=www.unav.es |archive-url= |archive-date=2013-03-20 |dead-url= |access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880 the [[French Academy of Sciences|French Academy of sciences]] adopted Peirce's measurement of the seconds pendulum length in Paris, which was 993.934 [[Millimetre|millimetres]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In 1886 the association of geodesy changed name for the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]], which [[Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero]] presided up to his death in 1891. During this period the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]] (German: ''Internationale Erdmessung'') gained worldwide importance with the joining of United States, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Torge|first=Wolfgang|title=From a Regional Project to an International Organization: The “Baeyer-Helmert-Era” of the International Association of Geodesy 1862–1916 |date=2015 |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1345_2015_42 |work=International Association of Geodesy Symposia |pages=3–18 |publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en |doi=10.1007/1345_2015_42 |isbn=9783319246031 |access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Torge |first=W. |date=2005-03-25 |title=The International Association of Geodesy 1862 to 1922: from a regional project to an international organization|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00190-004-0423-0 |journal=Journal of Geodesy |language=en |volume=78 |issue=9 |pages=558–568 |doi=10.1007/s00190-004-0423-0 |issn=0949-7714}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 1901, in response to a bill proposed by Congressman [[James H. Southard]] (R, Ohio), the National Bureau of Standards was founded with the mandate to provide standard weights and measures, and to serve as the national physical laboratory for the United States. (Southard had previously sponsored a bill for metric conversion of the United States.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Story of Standards|last=Perry|first=John|publisher=Funk and Wagnalls|year=1953|isbn=|location=Library of Congress Cat. No. 55-11094|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] appointed [[Samuel Wesley Stratton|Samuel W. Stratton]] as the first director. The budget for the first year of operation was $40,000. The Bureau took custody of the copies of the kilogram and metre bars that were the standards for US measures, and set up a program to provide [[metrology]] services for United States scientific and commercial users.

Efforts to supplement the various national [[surveying]] systems, which begun in the 19th century with the foundation of the ''[[International Association of Geodesy|Mitteleuropäische Gradmessung]]'', resulted in a series of global [[Ellipsoid|ellipsoids]] of the Earth (e.g., [[Friedrich Robert Helmert|Helmert]] 1906, [[John Fillmore Hayford|Hayford]] 1910/ 1924) which would later lead to develop the [[World Geodetic System]].

=== Standard gravity and the international prototype metre ===
The construction of the international prototype metre and the copies which would be national standards was at the limits of the technology of the time. The bars were to be made of a special alloy, 90%&amp;nbsp;[[platinum]] and 10%&amp;nbsp;[[iridium]], which is significantly harder than pure platinum, and have a special X-shaped cross section (a "[[Tresca section]]", named after French engineer [[Henri Tresca]]) to minimise the effects of torsional strain during length comparisons.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite journal | first=Robert A. | last=Nelson | title=Foundations of the international system of units (SI) | journal=[[The Physics Teacher]] | date=December 1981 | pages=596–613 | url=http://www.physics.umd.edu/deptinfo/facilities/lecdem/services/refs/refsa/Nelson-FoundationsSI.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first castings proved unsatisfactory, and the job was given to the London firm of [[Johnson Matthey]] who succeeded in producing thirty bars to the required specification. One of these, No. 6, was determined to be identical in length to the ''{{lang|fr|mètre des Archives}}'', and was consecrated as the international prototype metre at the first meeting of the CGPM in 1889. The other bars, duly calibrated against the international prototype, were distributed to the signatory nations of the Metre Convention for use as national standards.&lt;ref name="BIPMhist"&gt;{{citation | title=The BIPM and the evolution of the definition of the metre | url=http://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/history-si/evolution-metre.html | publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] | accessdate=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the United States received No.&amp;nbsp;27 with a calibrated length of {{nowrap|0.999 9984 m ± 0.2 µm}} (1.6&amp;nbsp;µm short of the international prototype).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=National Prototype Meter No.&amp;nbsp;27 | url=http://museum.nist.gov/object.asp?ObjID=37 | publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] | accessdate=2010-08-17 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615023423/http://museum.nist.gov/object.asp?ObjID=37# | archive-date=2010-06-15 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first (and only) follow-up comparison of the national standards with the international prototype was carried out between 1921 and 1936,&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BIPMhist"/&gt; and indicated that the definition of the metre was preserved to within 0.2&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref name="Barrell"&gt;{{cite journal | first=H. | last=Barrell | title=The Metre | journal=[[Contemporary Physics]] | year=1962 | volume=3 | issue=6 | pages=415–434 | doi=10.1080/00107516208217499 | bibcode=1962ConPh...3..415B}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, it was decided that a more formal definition of the metre was required (the 1889 decision had said merely that the "prototype, at the temperature of melting ice, shall henceforth represent the metric unit of length"), and this was agreed at the 7th&amp;nbsp;CGPM in 1927.&lt;ref name="oldSI"&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|pages=142–143, 148}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|The unit of length is the metre, defined by the distance, at 0°, between the axes of the two central lines marked on the bar of platinum–iridium kept at the ''{{lang|fr|Bureau International des Poids et Mesures}}'' and declared Prototype of the metre by the 1st&amp;nbsp;''{{lang|fr|Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures}}'', this bar being subject to standard atmospheric pressure and supported on two cylinders of at least one centimetre diameter, symmetrically placed in the same horizontal plane at a distance of 571&amp;nbsp;mm from each other.}}

Already in the early days of its existence, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) proceeded to define a standard [[Thermometer|thermometric]] scale, using the [[boiling point]] of water. Since the boiling point varies with the [[atmospheric pressure]], the CIPM needed to define a standard atmospheric pressure. The definition they chose was based on the weight of a column of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] of 760&amp;nbsp;mm. But since that weight depends on the local gravity, they now also needed a [[standard gravity]]. The 1887 CIPM meeting decided as follows:

{{quote|The value of this '''''standard acceleration due to gravity''''' is equal to the acceleration due to gravity at the International Bureau (alongside the [[Pavillon de Breteuil]]) divided by 1.0003322, the theoretical coefficient required to convert to a latitude of 45° at sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From Artefacts to Atoms: The BIPM and the Search for Ultimate Measurement Standards |author=Terry Quinn |page=127 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-19-530786-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

All that was needed to obtain a numerical value for [[standard gravity]] was now to measure the gravitational strength at the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures|International Bureau]]. This task was given to Gilbert Étienne Defforges of the Geographic Service of the French Army. The value he found, based on measurements taken in March and April 1888, was 9.80991(5)&amp;nbsp;m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite proceedings |author=M. Amalvict |chapter=Chapter 12. Absolute gravimetry at BIPM, Sèvres (France), at the time of Dr. Akihiko Sakuma |title=Gravity, Geoid and Earth Observation: IAG Commission 2: Gravity Field |editor=Stelios P. Mertikas |pages=84–85 |publisher=Springer |year=2010 |isbn=978-3-642-10634-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This result formed the basis for determining the value still used today for standard gravity. The third [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]], held in 1901, adopted a resolution declaring as follows:

{{quote|The value adopted in the International Service of Weights and Measures for the standard acceleration due to Earth's gravity is 980.665&amp;nbsp;cm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, value already stated in the laws of some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Resolution of the 3rd CGPM (1901) |url=http://www1.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/3/2/ |publisher=[[BIPM]] |accessdate=July 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The numeric value adopted for {{math|''ɡ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} was, in accordance with the 1887 CIPM declaration, obtained by dividing Defforges's result – 980.991&amp;nbsp;cm⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; in the [[cgs]] system then ''en vogue'' – by  1.0003322 while not taking more digits than warranted considering the uncertainty in the result.

'''Self-drying [[concrete]] technology''' is found in certain [[cementitious]] patching and leveling materials and [[tile setting|tile-setting]] [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]]s used in the flooring industry. Self-drying technology allows the cement mix to consume all of its mix water while curing, eliminating the need for excess water to evaporate prior to installing flooring. Traditional floor coverings, such as VCT, sheet vinyl, carpet and ceramic tile, can be installed before the material is completely dry and as soon as it hardens, which typically happens in the first two hours after placement.

Traditional concrete has a water:cement ratio of about 0.5, which refers to the weight of the water divided by the weight of the cement.  A water:cement ratio of 0.5 provides good workability while keeping the amount of excess water in the mix fairly low.  Without at least this much extra water, the concrete would be too dry to place.

The chemical reaction of [[Portland cement]] and water that is known as hydration, which is necessary for the strengthening of the concrete, requires a water:cement ratio of only about 0.25.  With a water:cement ratio of 0.5, there is twice the amount of water in the concrete mix than what is needed for hydration. This excess water needs to evaporate before flooring can be installed.  Note: The magical number of 28 days defines only the designed strength of the concrete but has nothing to do with the dryness of it.  E.g. A 10-year-old concrete slab can contain more moisture than a 28-day-old slab!  Conversely, a self-drying concrete blend consumes all of its mix water with a water:cement ratio of up to 0.6, maintaining good workability while allowing flooring to be installed before it is completely dry.

There are also cement products that are partially self-drying, meaning that they use a high percentage of their mix water for hydration as opposed to using 100% of it. This type of product might be used when the flooring does not need to be installed the same day but must still be installed more quickly than traditional concrete would allow. For instance, products that are 80% self-drying allow flooring to be installed the next day, typically after a 16-hour cure.

Self-drying technology was developed by Ardex (#Ardexisking) in Germany and was introduced in the United States in 1978.

'''Stithians Reservoir''' is a [[reservoir]] situated just under a mile to the west of the village of [[Stithians]], [[Cornwall]], England, [[United Kingdom|UK]].

==History==
Work on the dam began on 19 July 1962, however work stopped shortly after due to excavations which revealed the site was over a large area of soft kaolinised [[granite]], which would require expensive foundations. A new design was drawn up for the dam, which was the current arched design. The dam was opened on 13 October 1967 by [[Sir John Carew Pole, 12th Baronet|Sir John Carew Pole]], whilst the [[Bishop of Truro]], Dr [[Maurice Key]] blessed the reservoir.

By the opening in 1967 the valley behind the dam was completely flooded, 274 acres of farmland and three country houses would{{Clarify|date=May 2011}} were now submerged. Two [[causeway]]s were built to carry sections of roads that were flooded, one at the southern end and the other in the north western corner near the Golden Lion Inn.

==Statistics==
The dam is 41.5 m high and 244m wide. It was built at a total cost of £1,125,000 (about £17&amp;nbsp;million today) (2009 estimate).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17051">The structure of [[liquid]]s, [[glass]]es and other [[non-crystalline solid]]s is characterized by the absence of [[order and disorder (physics)#Long-range order|long-range order]] which defines crystalline materials. Liquids and amorphous solids do, however, possess a rich and varied array of short to medium range order, which originates from [[chemical bond]]ing and related interactions. [[Metallic glass]]es, for example, are typically well described by the [[random close pack|dense random packing]] of hard spheres, whereas covalent systems, such as [[silicate glass]]es, have sparsely packed, strongly bound, [[tetrahedral]] network structures. These very different structures result in materials with very different physical properties and applications.

The study of liquid and glass structure aims to gain insight into their behavior and physical properties, so that they can be understood, predicted and tailored for specific applications. Since the structure and resulting behavior of liquids and glasses is a complex [[many body problem]], historically it has been too computationally intensive to solve using [[quantum mechanics]] directly. Instead, a variety of [[diffraction]], [[NMR]], [[Molecular dynamics]], and [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo simulation techniques]] are most commonly used.

==Pair distribution functions &amp; Structure factors==

[[File:Lennard-Jones Radial Distribution Function.svg|thumb|300px|Radial distribution function of the [[Lennard–Jones potential|Lennard-Jones model fluid]].]]

The [[pair distribution function]] (or pair correlation function) of a material describes the probability of finding an atom at a separation  ''r'' from another atom.

A typical plot of ''g'' versus ''r'' of a liquid or glass shows a number of key features:

# At short separations (small r), ''g(r)'' = 0. This indicates the effective width of the atoms, which limits their distance of approach.
# A number of obvious peaks and troughs are present. These peaks indicate that the atoms pack around each other in 'shells' of nearest neighbors. Typically the 1st peak in ''g(r)'' is the strongest feature. This is due to the relatively strong chemical bonding and repulsion effects felt between neighboring atoms in the 1st shell.
# The attenuation of the peaks at increasing radial distances from the center indicates the decreasing degree of order from the center particle. This illustrates vividly the absence of "long-range order" in liquids and glasses.
# At long ranges, ''g(r)'' approaches a limiting value of 1, which corresponds to the macroscopic density of the material.

The [[static structure factor]], ''S(q)'', which can be measured with diffraction techniques, is related to its corresponding ''g(r)'' by Fourier transformation

{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;S(q)-1=\frac{4\pi\rho}{ q}  \int_{0}^{\infty} r[g(r)-1]\sin{(qr)}{d}r&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where ''q'' is the magnitude of the momentum transfer vector, and ρ is the number density of the material. Like ''g(r)'', the ''S(q)'' patterns of 
liquids and glasses have a number of key features:

# For mono-atomic systems the ''S(q=0)'' limit is related to the isothermal compressibility. Also a rise at the low-''q'' limit indicates the presence of [[small angle scattering]], due to large scale structure or voids in the material.
# The sharpest peaks (or troughs) in ''S(q)'' typically occur in the ''q''=1-3 Angstrom range. These normally indicate the presence of some ''medium range order'' corresponding to structure in the 2nd and higher coordination shells in ''g(r)''.
# At high-''q'' the structure is typically a decaying sinusoidal oscillation, with a 2π/''r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' wavelength where ''r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the 1st shell peak position in g(r).
# At very high-''q'' the ''S(q)'' tends to 1, consistent with its definition.

===Diffraction===

The absence of [[long-range order]] in liquids and glasses is evidenced by the absence of [[Bragg peak]]s in [[X-ray diffraction|X-ray]] and [[neutron diffraction]]. For these [[isotropic]] materials, the diffraction pattern has circular symmetry, and in the radial direction, the diffraction intensity has a smooth oscillatory shape. This diffracted intensity is usually analyzed to give the [[static structure factor]], ''S(q)'', where ''q'' is given by ''q''=4πsin(θ)/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle (the angle between the incident and scattered quanta), and λ is the incident wavelength of the probe (photon or neutron). Typically diffraction measurements are performed at a single (monochromatic) λ, and diffracted intensity is measured over a range of 2θ angles, to give a wide range of ''q''. Alternatively a range of λ, may be used, allowing the intensity measurements to be taken at a fixed or narrow range of 2θ. In x-ray diffraction, such measurements are typically called “energy dispersive”, whereas in neutron diffraction this is normally called “time-of-flight” reflecting the different detection methods used.
Once obtained, an ''S(q)'' pattern can be [[Fourier transform]]ed to provide a corresponding [[radial distribution function]] (or pair correlation function), denoted in this article as ''g(r)''. For an isotropic material, the relation between ''S(q)'' and  its corresponding ''g(r)'' is

{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;g(r)-1=\frac{1}{2\pi^2\rho r}  \int_{0}^{\infty} q[S(q)-1]\sin{(qr)}{d}q&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

The ''g(r)'', which describes the probability of finding an atom at a separation ''r''  from another atom,  provides a more intuitive description of the atomic structure. The ''g(r)'' pattern obtained from a diffraction measurement represents a spatial, and thermal average of all the [[pair correlations]] in the material, weighted by their coherent cross-sections with the incident beam.

===Atomistic Simulation===

By definition, ''g(r)'' is related to the average number of particles found within a given volume of shell located at a distance ''r'' from the center. The average density of atoms at a given radial distance from another atom is given by the formula:

{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;g(r) = \frac{n(r)}{\rho 4\pi r^2 \Delta r}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

where ''n''(''r'') is the mean number of atoms in a shell of width Δ''r'' at distance ''r''.&lt;ref&gt;McQuarrie, D.A., ''Statistical Mechanics'' (Harper Collins, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''g(r)'' of a simulation box can be calculated easily by histograming the particle separations using the following equation

{{NumBlk|:| &lt;math&gt;
g_{ab}(r) = \frac{1}{N_{a} N_b}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_a} \sum\limits_{j=1}^{N_b} \langle \delta( \vert \mathbf{r}_{ij} \vert -r)\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

where ''N&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the number of ''a'' particles, |'''''r&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'''''| is the magnitude of the separation of the pair of particles ''i,j''. Atomistic simulations can also be used in conjunction with [[interatomic potential|interatomic pair potential]] functions in order to calculate macroscopic thermodynamic parameters such as the internal energy, Gibbs free energy, entropy and enthalpy of the system.

==Other techniques==

Other experimental techniques often employed to study the structure of glasses include [[Nuclear Magnetic Resonance]] (NMR), [[X-ray absorption fine structure]] (XAFS) and other spectroscopy methods including [[Raman spectroscopy]]. Experimental measurements can be combined with computer simulation methods, such as [[Reverse Monte Carlo]] (RMC) or [[molecular dynamics]] (MD) simulations, to obtain more complete and detailed description of the atomic structure.

==Network glasses==

[[File:Silica.svg|thumb|The random network structure of glassy SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in two-dimensions. Note that, as in the crystal, each Silicon atom is bonded to 4 oxygen atoms, where the fourth oxygen atom is obscured from view in this plane.]]
[[File:SiO² Quartz.svg|thumb|The periodic crystalline lattice structure of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in two-dimensions.]]

Early theories relating to the structure of glass included the crystallite theory whereby glass is an aggregate of [[crystallite]]s (extremely small crystals).&lt;ref name="Wright94JNCS"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/0022-3093(94)90687-4|author=Adrian C Wright|title=Neutron scattering from vitreous silica. V. The structure of vitreous silica: What have we learned from 60 years of diffraction studies?|journal=Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids|year=1994|volume=179|pages=84–115|bibcode = 1994JNCS..179...84W }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, structural determinations of vitreous SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; made by Warren and co-workers in the 1930s using [[x-ray diffraction]] showed the structure of glass to be typical of an [[amorphous solid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1932 [[William Houlder Zachariasen|Zachariasen]] introduced the random network theory of glass in which the nature of bonding in the glass is the same as in the crystal but where the basic structural units in a glass are connected in a random manner in contrast to the periodic arrangement in a crystalline material.
&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite the lack of long range order, the structure of glass does exhibit a high degree of ordering on short length scales due to the chemical bonding constraints in local atomic [[polyhedra]].&lt;ref name="P.S. Salmon 2002 87"&gt;{{cite journal|author=P.S. Salmon|title=Order within disorder|doi=10.1038/nmat737|journal=Nature Materials|pmid=12618817|volume=1|issue=2|pages=87–8|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra that form the fundamental structural units in [[silica]] glass represent a high degree of order, i.e. every silicon atom is coordinated by 4 oxygen atoms and the nearest neighbour Si-O bond length exhibits only a narrow distribution throughout the structure.&lt;ref name="Wright94JNCS"/&gt; The tetrahedra in silica also form a network of ring structures which leads to ordering on more intermediate length scales of up to approximately 10 [[Angstrom]]s.

Alternative views of the structure of liquids and glasses include the interstitialcy
model &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Granato A. V. | year = 1992 | title = Interstitialcy model for condensed matter states of face-centered-cubic metals | url = | journal = Phys. Rev.

and the model of ''string-like'' correlated motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Donati C., Glotzer S. C., Poole P. H., Kob W., Plimpton S.

Molecular dynamics computer simulations indicate these two models are closely connected
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nordlund K., Ashkenazy Y., Averback R. S., Granato A. V. | year = 2005 | title = Strings and interstitials in liquids, glasses and crystals | url = | journal = Europhys.

As in other [[amorphous solid]]s, the atomic structure of a glass lacks any long range [[translational symmetry|translational periodicity]]. However, due to [[chemical bonding]] characteristics glasses do possess a high degree of short-range order with respect to local atomic [[polyhedra]].&lt;ref name="P.S. Salmon 2002 87"/&gt;

It is deemed that the bonding structure of glasses, although disordered, has the same symmetry signature ([[Hausdorff dimension|Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimensionality]]) as for crystalline materials.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11507"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=M.I. Ojovan |author2=W.E. Lee |title=Topologically disordered systems at the glass transition|doi=10.1088/0953-8984/18/50/007|journal=J. Phys.: Condens. Matter|volume=18|issue=50 |pages=11507–11520|year=2006|bibcode=2006JPCM...1811507O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Glass tetrahedon.png|thumb|left|[[Tetrahedron|Tetrahedral]] structural unit of silica (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the basic building block of common glasses.]]

===Crystalline SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===

[[Silica]] (the chemical compound SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has a number of distinct [[crystal]]line forms: quartz, tridymite, cistobalite, and others (including the high pressure [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] [[Stishovite]] and [[Coesite]]). Nearly all of them involve [[tetrahedral]] SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; units linked together by ''shared vertices'' in different arrangements. Si-O bond lengths vary between the different crystal forms. For example, in α-quartz the bond length is 161 pm, whereas in α-tridymite it ranges from 154–171 pm. The Si-O-Si bond angle also varies from 140° in α-tridymite to 144° in α-quartz to 180° in β-tridymite.

===Glassy SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===

In amorphous silica ([[fused quartz]]), the SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra form a network that does not exhibit any long-range order. However, the tetrahedra themselves represent a high degree of local ordering, i.e. every silicon atom is coordinated by 4 oxygen atoms and the nearest neighbour Si-O bond length exhibits only a narrow distribution throughout the structure.&lt;ref name="Wright94JNCS"/&gt; If one consider the atomic network of silica as a mechanical truss, this structure is isostatic, in the sense that the number of constraints acting between the atoms equals the number of degrees of freedom of the latter. According to the [[Rigidity theory (physics)|rigidity theory]], this allows this material to show a great forming ability.&lt;ref name=phillips1979&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillips|first=J.C.|title=Topology of covalent non-crystalline solids I: Short-range order in chalcogenide alloys|journal=Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids|year=1979|volume=34|issue=2|page=153|doi=10.1016/0022-3093(79)90033-4|bibcode = 1979JNCS...34..153P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lack of ordering on extended length scales, the tetrahedra also form a network of ring-like structures which lead to ordering on intermediate length scales (up to approximately 10 Angstroms or so).&lt;ref name="Wright94JNCS"/&gt; Under the application of high pressure (approximately 40 GPa) silica glass undergoes a continuous [[polyamorphism|polyamorphic]] phase transition into an octahedral form, i.e. the Si atoms are surrounded by 6 oxygen atoms instead of four in the ambient pressure tetrahedral glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=C.

'''Torbal''' is a manufacturer of prescription scales that are used in pharmacies, and it produces a laboratory scales including [[analytical balance]]s for research purposes and industrial scales for quality control applications.  In addition, the company makes related products such as moisture analyzers and [[force gauge]]s.

Torbal traces its manufacturing of scales and balances to 1897. The name "Torbal" is an acronym and trademark for the '''Torsion Balance Company'''. The company has had several different owners throughout its history.  It is now owned by Scientific Industries, Inc. which is a publicly owned New York corporation headquartered in [[Bohemia, New York]].

The company markets its products primarily in the northern hemisphere with the US, Canada, and Mexico predominating.  Torbal sells through some distributors in the pharmacy market, but the bulk of its sales are done through direct purchasing.  It operates a number of affiliated web sites and also sells directly through [[e-commerce]].

The company has continuously manufactured and sold torsion balances. Torbal's scales are used for pill counting and for drug compounding. Its principal markets have been retail druggists who have used it in compounding prescriptions, and with users who needed a precision weighing device that could be used under adverse conditions that would quickly ruin balances with knife edges or friction bearings. 

==History==
[[Image:Torsion Balance Stand - Weighing Trade Show.jpg|thumb|right|The Torsion Balance booth taking part at a weighing trade show]]

===The Torsion Balance Company (1897–1944)===
The Torsion Balance Company was preceded by the '''Springer Torsion Balance Company''', whose Certificate of Incorporation was filed on September 7, 1897. The purposes of that corporation were to "acquire the ownership of patents on scales, balances, automatic discharging meters, and other instruments of precision and to manufacture and sell such articles." Five years later, The Torsion Balance Company filed a New York State Certificate of Incorporation .

The corporation had its principal place of business at 92 Reade Street, New York City, and a plant in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]]. In May 1949 both the New York office and the Jersey City plant were moved to New Jersey, and consolidated in a new factory in [[Clifton, New Jersey]].

On February 8, 1915, the Torsion Balance Company bought the business carried on under the name of Christian Becker which was engaged in the manufacture and sale of analytical balances. This purchase included the right to the use of the trade name "Christian Becker". The acquisition of Christian Becker offered opportunity for the introduction of the torsion balance into laboratories as a balance less sensitive and less expensive than the analytical balance, but one for which there was a need. Over these succeeding years, the sales volume of Torsion Balance laboratory scales was built up until it was second to Torsion’s pharmacy sales. Additional markets for the Torsion Balance were found in the dairy industry, where the balance was used to determine the butter-fat content of milk, and in the textile industry.

After the acquisition of the business of Christian Becker, the Torsion Balance Company formed a New York corporation called '''Christian Becker Incorporated''' by filing a certificate dated February 18, 1915. Its directors were Harold H. Fries, William Clark Symington, and Robert B. Symington who were also its original stockholders and all of 92 Reade Street, New York City. This corporation remained in existence until the year 1943 when it was dissolved in the manner later described; and it, thereupon, became a division of the Torsion Balance Company.

===Christian Becker===
[[File:Becker &amp; Sons Certificate.jpg|thumb|right|A Certificate of Award to Becker &amp; Sons from the US Centennial Commission]]
Christopher Becker came to New York from Arnhem, the Netherlands in 1836, leaving two sons Jule and Henry in the Netherlands. With his other sons Christian and Ernest, he established an observatory at 54 Columbia Street in Brooklyn where he manufactured nautical and astronomical instruments. In 1854 Professor J. Renevick of Columbia College asked Christopher to manufacture an analytical balance to supplement several British and German ones he already had. The result was good, and Becker and Sons was founded for the purpose of manufacturing balances and weights. Christian and Ernest were the sons of Becker and Sons.

In 1861, possibly to get away from the Civil War, the family returned to the Netherlands and manufactured balances in Antwerp. It is likely that the other two brothers Jule and Henry participated in this venture and gained their knowledge of balances in this way. When the Civil War was ended (1865), Christopher, Christian, and Ernest returned to the United States and established a new factory in Hudson City, New Jersey.

Jule and Henry established Becker and Sons, Rotterdam and H. L. Becker, Fila, Brussels. Whether there were originally two joint ventures is not clear, but Jule is predominantly associated with the Rotterdam Company and Henry with the Brussels firm.

Christopher moved from Hudson City, New Jersey to Newark, New Jersey and in 1874 to New Rochelle, New York. In 1884 the sons left Christopher and started their own business as '''Becker Bros.''' Christopher continued his business as Christopher Becker and apparently died soon afterwards.

In 1892 Ernest died, and the name was changed to Christian Becker. In 1915 the company was bought by the Torsion Balance Company.  Christian's two sons, Christopher and Frank continued to be associated with the Torsion Balance Company. Christopher died in 1949 and Frank in 1956. Christopher (Sr.) is credited by 9th Edition of Britannica with the invention of plane bearings. Christopher (Jr.) held the patent on the chainomatic device (1915) and received the Franklin Medal for this development.

===Modernization and Vertex (1946–2000)===
[[File:Torbal Lab Research.jpg|thumb|left|Torbal employees inspecting a line of scales in the laboratory]]
Harold H. Fries died on June 29, 1946 and his shares were ultimately registered in the name of Wills and Company as nominee.  Upon the death of Harold H. Fries, it was found that there was no one suitable to act as directing head. The attorney for the estate, Walter D. Fletcher, was designated as President of the Torsion Balance Company as an interim measure until a new directing head could be found. In the intervening months, this effort went on, and on December 13, 1946, Charles E. Donovan was made Vice President and active directing head of the Company. He was elected president of the company on November 12, 1947.  At the meeting of the Board of Directors on December 13, 1946, it was decided that this company would undergo a complete modernization. In the course of this modernization a new plant was erected, the three principal lines of balances were redesigned to be more acceptable in the market, new machinery was acquired, new tooling and new sales policies were adopted, new accounting procedures installed and practically a new organization created.

This modernization was successful and the company grew in its Clifton, NJ facility.  However, increased competition from European companies, especially Mettler and Sartorious, for space in the major distributor’s catalogs was becoming a problem, as were US labor costs.  It was decided that a new manufacturing facility in Ireland might reduce product cost to manufacture and increase Torsion’s competitive position.  The move was unsuccessful and much of the company’s assets were dissipated as a result. It was decided by the [[Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.|Brown Brothers Harriman Bank]] that Torbal be discreetly put up for sale.  Brown Brothers were involved on behalf of Roland Harriman, [[Averill Harriman]]’s older brother, and had purchased all of the Torsion Balance Stock to settle an internal squabble.  The company was sold to Vertex Industries Inc. in 1965.

Torbal prospered under Vertex and was restored to full strength by 1970.  Vertex was becoming interested in automatic Identification technology and acquired a bar code company, Identicon, and also acquired a magnetic stripe readers product line from the Business Products Division of Dymo Industries.  The era of digital scales had arrived, and once again Torbal was coming under competitive pressure.  Vertex decided that the auto ID business showed far more growth potential and did not invest in the development of electronic digital scales.  Torbal continued with its mechanical scales until in 2000 the Company was sold by Vertex to Fulcrum Inc., the present owner.

===Present day===
The company relocated and soon began to develop its line of digital scales.  It developed an alliance with a Polish scale manufacturer that has a first class ISO approved manufacturing facility, excellent technical capability, and very competitive labor costs.  Working together they produced a line of prescription scales, and then a line of laboratory and analytical scales for the North American market. The alliance continues today.

Since the introduction of their first digital scales, Fulcrum has made huge advances in the technology of these products.  Creating patented features such as Advanced Pill Counting Accuracy (APA) and Pill Fragment Detection (PFD) has contributed to the increased efficiency of pharmacies and safety of their customers.  Rx Verification, also known as NDC Verification, has enabled pharmacists to match the barcodes on prescriptions with those on the supply bottles.

In an effort to expand the Torbal line, Fulcrum introduced industrial weighing scales, moisture analyzers, and washdown scales.  These added products appealed to a larger segment of laboratory and industrial sectors.  With the expanded product selections, Fulcrum was able to begin offering customizable firmware to customers.  The service, known as “Torbal Custom,” was created so that customers could better utilize Torbal products for their intended applications.

In 2012, Fulcrum broke into the force gauge industry with the release of their FA series gauges.  The force gauges were the first weighing devices offered under the Torbal brand that were not required to be used as a stationary top or bottom loading unit.  The FA series included ergonomic gauges with internal weighing mechanisms as well as high capacity models with external load cells.  An FC series was announced to be released in the spring of 2014.

To complement Torbal’s upcoming FC line, they are currently developing a motorized test stand.  This accessory will not only eliminate the need for users to manually drive the gauge along the stand, but it will provide more accurate force over distance measurements by simply inputting the desired distance prior to testing.

Fulcrum, Inc. looks to finalize their development of micro-analytical scales in the near future as well.

==Products==
The company produces a wide range of weighing products.  The present day product line includes industrial scales, moisture analyzers, and force gauges, and newer versions of lab and analytical balances.  An up-to-date line of prescription scales and systems is available for pharmacies. Sensitivity ranges from 0.0001g for its analytical balances, 0.001g for its laboratory and prescription scales, and 0.01g for its industrial scales.  Capacities range from 50.0g up to 6000.0g for the lab, analytical, prescription and industrial scales.  Torbal crane scales and force gauges can go to higher capacities. 
[[File:ST-1 Balance.jpg|thumb|left|The ST-1 balance was originally manufactured to be a teaching balance for high school and college students.]]
The company has produced many products thatreceived industry recognition, e.g., magazine ranking or metrology society awards.  The most famous was the Model EA-1 which was the first analytical balance to use electronic force substitution. The last three digits of weight were read from a digital Veeder Root dial that was linked to a precision 10 turn potentiometer.  The potentiometer output voltage was converted to force coil current which caused a magnet suspended from the weigh beam to apply a linear force to bring the mechanism into a precise balance condition.  Also in the balance an E-Core type structure was used to detect the beam position and the result was displayed on an electronic zero center null meter.  The first three decades were done with digital weight loading dials. This balance, which was marketed starting in the early 1960s, is still in use in many labs around the country and they appear fairly regularly on e-bay as they are retired.

Another scale of significance was the Model PL-1, which was quickly followed by a series of scales based upon the same principle.  This scale was an optical projection type that was intended for both laboratory and industrial use.  The first decade was a digital weight loader which was used to bring the beam close enough to a null position so that the next three digits could be read directly off of an optical projection screen.  Many people claimed that the optical portion of the scale was accurate to four places, however, reading a linear dial projection to four places without a vermier is a real feat.  In this scale the beam deflection moved a glass plate which contained the graduated scale and the image was projected onto a screen in the front of the scale.  The scale used a viscous fluid dashpot type of damping system and was remarkably fast.  It soon became the favorite scale for many industrial applications because the torsion type taut band suspension made it very rugged and the simplicity of weighing combined with its fast damping made QC testing a simple chore.

One other scale that is deserving of recognition is the Model ST-1, which was designed specifically to be a student balance that could be used in high school and college chemistry labs to do accurate weighing (0.01% can’t be called precision) and allow students to develop a feel for weighing.  The scale’s structure was actually half of an equal arm Roberval balance.  A calibrated dial with a calibrated spring attached to it was used to apply a restoring torque to equal that of the torque applied by the unknown weight.  With an attractive price this scale soon became very popular in schools across the nation.

[[File:DRX-3.jpg|thumb|right|A DRX-3 model pharmacy balance.  This is the only mechanical balance that Torbal continues to produce to this day.]]
The only mechanical pharmacy balance still manufactured by Torbal is the DRX-3.

This page documents the tornadoes and tornado outbreaks of 1966, primarily in the United States. Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes.

'''Vitalij Aab''' (born November 14, 1979, in [[Karaganda]], [[Soviet Union]]) is a German [[ice hockey]] player who is currently an [[Unrestricted Free Agent]]. He most recently played for the [[Thomas Sabo Ice Tigers]] in the [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga|DEL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icetigers.de/ICETIGERS/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=518:vitalij-aab-kehrt-nach-nuernberg-zurueck&amp;catid=1:aktuelle-nachrichten&amp;Itemid=76|title=Vitalij Aab returns to Nürnberg|publisher=Thomas Sabo Ice Tigers|language=German|date=2010-05-11|accessdate=2010-05-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226201047/http://www.icetigers.de/ICETIGERS/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=518:vitalij-aab-kehrt-nach-nuernberg-zurueck&amp;catid=1:aktuelle-nachrichten&amp;Itemid=76|archivedate=2010-12-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==
Vitalij Aab's professional debut was at the age of 17 for EC Wilhelmshaven. In his second season, he scored 28 points. In 1999, he was promoted into the second division with Wilhelmshaven. Two years later, he transferred to the [[Nuremberg Ice Tigers]], where he played for three years. During this time he played so well that the German national coach called him up to play for the [[Germany men's national ice hockey team|German national ice hockey team]]. Aab had the worst season of his career in 2004–05 with the [[Adler Mannheim]]; he only scored 24 points in 48 games, and therefore received very little ice time at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeyweb.de/static/spielerportraits/aab_vitalij.htm|title=Vitalij Aab profile|website=Hockeyweb.de|date=2010-05-11|accessdate=2010-05-11|language=German|archivedate=2007-12-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219224955/http://www.hockeyweb.de/static/spielerportraits/aab_vitalij.htm|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He left Mannheim after only one season and switched to the [[Iserlohn Roosters]]. After struggling at first, Aab's performance improved dramatically. At the end of the season, he was the highest scorer in Germany. Before the 2006–07 season, he signed with the [[Hamburg Freezers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=German|website=abendblatt.de|date=2006-05-09 |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2008/09/26/943403.html|title=Vitalij Aab: Forward joins the Freezers|accessdate=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yangshan Quarry - Monument Body and Head - P1060893.JPG|thumb|The unfinished stele body (right) and the [[stele]] head (left). The work on the dragon design had been started on the head before the project was abandoned]]
The '''Yangshan Quarry''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|阳山|碑|材}}|p=Yángshān bēi cái|l=Yangshan Stele Material}}) is an ancient stone quarry near [[Nanjing]], China. Used during many centuries as a source of stone for buildings and monuments of Nanjing, it is preserved as a historic site. The quarry is famous for the gigantic unfinished [[stele]] that was abandoned there during the reign of the [[Yongle Emperor]] in the early 15th century. In scope and ambition, the stele project is compared to other public works projects of Yongle era, which included the launching of the [[Chinese treasure fleet|treasure fleet]] for [[Ming treasure voyages|Zheng He's maritime expeditions]] and the construction of the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing.&lt;ref name=kristof/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louise Levathes, ''When China Ruled the Seas: Treasure Fleets of the Dragon Throne''.

==Location==
[[File:Yangshan Quarry - Monument Base - P1060908.JPG|thumb|The stele base, partly separated from the body of the mountain]]
The Yangshan Quarry is situated on the Yangshan Mountain (elevation 140 m),&lt;ref name=njmq/&gt;
also known as Yanmen Shan ({{lang|zh|雁门山}}),
northwest of Tangshan Town ({{lang|zh|汤山镇}}).&lt;ref name=njmq&gt;{{harvnb|Yang|Lu|2001|pp=616–617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Yangshan is the main peak of the Kongshan Mountain Range ({{lang|zh|孔山山脉}}). The site is located 15–20&amp;nbsp;km to the east from the eastern part of [[Nanjing City Wall]] and the [[Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum]].&lt;ref&gt;As per Google Maps.&lt;/ref&gt; Administratively, the area is in the [[Jiangning District]] of Nanjing City, [[Jiangsu]] Province.

==History==

[[File:Yangshan Quarry - Monument Base - P1060848.JPG|thumb|The stele base, with a hiker next to it for scale]]
The Yangshan Quarry has been worked from the time of the [[Six Dynasties]], the local [[limestone]] being used for construction of buildings, walls, and statues in and around Nanjing.&lt;ref name=njmq/&gt;

After [[Zhu Yuanzhang]] (the Hongwu Emperor) founded the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1368, the city of [[Nanjing]] became the capital city of his empire. The Yangshan quarry became the main source of stone for the major construction projects that changed the face of Nanjing.&lt;ref name=till/&gt;
In 1405, Hongwu's son, the [[Yongle Emperor]], ordered the cutting of a giant stele in this quarry, for use in the [[Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum]] of his deceased father. In accordance with the usual design of a Chinese memorial [[stele]], three separate pieces were being cut: the rectangular stele base (pedestal), the stele body, and the stele head (crown, to be decorated with a dragon design). After most of the stone-cutting work had been done, the architects realized that moving stones that big from Yangshan to Ming Xiaoling, let alone installing them there in a proper way, would not be physically possible. As a result, the project was abandoned.&lt;ref name=njmq/&gt; In place of the stele, a much smaller tablet (still, the largest in the Nanjing area), known as the ''Shengong Shengde'' ("Divine Merits and Godly Virtues") Stele was installed in [[Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum|Ming Xiaoling]]'s "Square Pavilion" (Sifangcheng) &lt;ref name=njmq/&gt; in 1413.&lt;ref name=mx&gt;{{harvnb|Yang|Lu|2001|pp=595–599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three unfinished stele components remain in Yangshan Quarry to this day, only partially separated from the solid rock of the mountain. The present dimensions and the usual weight estimates of the steles are as follows:
* The Stele Base ({{coord|32|04|03|N|119|00|00|E}}), 30.35 m long, 13 m thick,  16 m tall,&lt;ref name=njmq/&gt; 16,250 metric tons.&lt;ref name=tsxc&gt;See e.g. [http://www.tsxc.gov.cn/ziyuan.asp?topid=3&amp;bigclassname=%D1%F4%C9%BD%B1%AE%B2%C4  YANGSHAN TABLET - THE FIRST TABLET IN THE WORLD / 阳山碑材天下第一碑] for the commonly given weight estimates. Their sizes are slightly different from those in Yang and Lu, which is not surprising, since the stone monoliths, after all, are not completely separated from the solid rock below.&lt;/ref&gt;{{deadlink|date=September 2018}}
* The Stele Body ({{coord|32|04|07|N|119|00|02|E}}), 49.4 m long (this would be the height, if the stele were to be properly installed), 10.7 m wide, 4.4 m thick,&lt;ref name=njmq/&gt;  8,799 tons.&lt;ref name=tsxc/&gt;
* The Stele Head ({{coord|32|04|06|N|119|00|02|E}}), 10.7 m tall, 20.3 m wide, 8.4 m thick,&lt;ref name=njmq/&gt; 6,118 tons.&lt;ref name=tsxc/&gt;

According to experts, if the stele had been finished and put together, by installing the stele body vertically on the base, and topping with the stele head, then it would have stood 73 meters tall.&lt;ref name=njmq/&gt; For comparison, the ''Shengong Shengde'' Stele actually installed in Ming Xiaoling is 8.78 m tall (6.7 m body + crown, on top of a 2.8 m tall [[bixi (tortoise)|tortoise pedestal]]).&lt;ref name=mx/&gt; The [[Song dynasty|Song-dynasty]] (early 12th century) [[Shou Qiu|''Wan Ren Chou'' ("Ten Thousand Men's Sorrow") Stele]] in [[Qufu]], which is thought to be one of the tallest in China, is 16.95 m tall, 3.75 m wide, 1.14 m thick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infobase.gov.cn/intro/sdzz/5.htm 山东之最] (Shandong's "Firsts")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=loh&gt;Pauline D Loh, "[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/weekendextra/2011-07/31/content_13018398.htm  Sons of the Yellow Emperor]". 2011-07-31, ''China Daily''. (This appeared in the hard copy of the newspaper on 2011-08-01)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The sizes are also given in the [http://www.hudong.com/wiki/%E5%B0%91%E6%98%8A%E9%99%B5 少昊陵] (Shao Hao Ling) article on Baidu.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
According to a legend, workers who failed to produce the daily quota of crushed rock of at least 33 ''[[Chinese units of measurement#Volume|sheng]]'' would be executed on the spot. In memory of the workers who died on the construction site—including those who died from overwork and disease—a nearby village became known as Fentou ({{lang|zh|坟头}}), or "Grave Mound".&lt;ref name=njmq/&gt; [[Ann Paludan]] translates the place name as "Death's Head Valley".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authorlink=Ann Paludan|first=Ann |last=Paludan

In the centuries since the giant stele project was abandoned, a number of Ming, Qing, and modern authors visited the site and left accounts of it.&lt;ref name=njmq/&gt; The poet [[Yuan Mei]] (1716 – 1797) expressed his feelings in "The Song of Hongwu's Great Stone Tablet" ({{lang|zh|洪武大石碑歌}}), which concludes with "one hundred thousand camels could not move it!" ("{{lang|zh|十万骆驼拉不起}}").&lt;ref name=njmq/&gt; The poem is published in his collection ''Xiao Cangshan Fang Wenji'' ({{lang|zh|小仓山房文集}}).

In 1956, the Yangshan Quarry was entered on the [[Jiangsu]] provincial register of protected cultural monuments.&lt;ref name=njmq/&gt; It is maintained as a tourist site, although, according to journalists who visited it at the turn of the 21st century, the site was little known even in Nanjing itself, and had few visitors.&lt;ref name=kristof&gt;{{citation|title=A Relic of Imperial Aspirations|first=Nicholas D.|last= Kristof|authorlink=Nicholas D.

A small [[theme park]] called the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] Culture Village ({{lang|zh|明文化村}}, ''Míng Wénhuà Cūn'') was constructed at the entrance to the site; as of 2011, it  has a stage, children's rides, and various history-themed amusements. A single admission ticket allows one to visit the "village" and then to walk some 300–400 m to the quarry proper on one of several forest trails. The site is open year-round, but still is mostly deserted in winter.

Transportation from Nanjing to the Yangshan Quarry (either directly to the Ming Culture Village's entrance plaza, or to the "Yangshan Quarry" stop on the Jiangsu Provincial Highway 122 (S122)) is provided by several bus routes, including the Nanjing-Tangshan Line ({{lang|zh|南汤线}},  ''Nán-Tāng Xiàn'') from the [[Nanjing Railway Station]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhhly.com/NewsView.asp?ID=193 单车游南京之阳山碑材] (By bike to Nanjing's Yangshan Quarry), 2011-04-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A 2011 Nanjing Public Transport Map&lt;/ref&gt;
