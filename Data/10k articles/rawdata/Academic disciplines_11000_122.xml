[[File:CALIFA HexDR2 mandala.png|thumb|A composite of panels depicting maps of some of the properties of galaxies obtained from CALIFA data.]]
The '''CALIFA Survey''' (''Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area Survey'') is an astronomical project to map 600 galaxies with [[Integral field spectrograph|integral field spectroscopy (IFS)]], to allow detailed studies of these objects. The data are taken at the [[Calar Alto Observatory]] in Spain.

==Project==
The CALIFA project addresses a number of open questions in galaxy evolution, among them: 
# The chemical evolution of galaxies: how, when, and where metals are produced in galaxies  
# Galaxy masses from different tracers: how much mass there is in stars, gas, and dark matter, and how it is distributed 
# Galaxy assembly as traced from the kinematic structure: what the motions of stars and gas tell us about the structure of the galaxies 
# Galaxy assembly as traced through the stellar population content: how, when, and where did stars form throughout the history of the galaxies

CALIFA data are made public through regular releases (DR). DR1, containing 200 data cubes of 100 galaxies, was released 1 November 2012.&lt;ref name=CALIFA-DR1&gt;{{cite journal |title= CALIFA, the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area survey. II.

Guerra, professor at the University of Southern California and chair of the [[Mexican American Political Association|Mexican American Political Association's]] (MAPA) Education Committee, reported in 1963 on "serious discriminatory policies and practices" at his university in relation to hiring Mexican Americans, especially considering that there had been an increase in the number of Mexican American students.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Making of Chicano Studies: In the Trenches of Academe|last = Acuna|first = Rodolfo|publisher = Rutgers University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 9780813550015|location = New Brunswick|pages = 14–35|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780813550701/9780813550701-9.pdf|chapter = The Sixties and the Bean Count}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serving Mexican American students without providing Mexican American faculty was considered a sort of colonialism and cultural assimilation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition, many Mexican American students were put at a disadvantage because speaking [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (even outside of class) was considered "degrading" or "un-American."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Opportunities such as the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) helped increase the number of minorities entering colleges and universities.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Educators and students alike began to visualize "an academic program that could serve and transform the Mexican American community," a program that would become Chicano studies and which was built by and for Chicanos.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chicano Studies: The Genesis of a Discipline|last = Soldatenko|first = Michael|publisher = University of Arizona Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780816599530|location = Tucson, Arizona|pages = 38–66|chapter = Empirics and Chicano Studies: The Formation of Empirical Chicano Studies, 1970-1975|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780816599530/9780816599530-7.pdf|access-date = 14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, anthropologist Octavio Romano along with graduate students at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] began to publish a Chicano studies journal called ''El Grito: A Journal of Contemporary Mexican-American Thought''.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f5h&amp;AN=76504493&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Chicano Studies Examined|last = Gonzalez|first = Phillip B.|date = 2012|journal = Journal of American Ethnic History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 May 2015|subscription = yes|volume = 31|issue = 4|pages = 69–74|issn = 0278-5927}}&lt;/ref&gt; His co-founder was Nick. C. Vaca.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Many of the ideas surrounding the formation of later Chicano studies programs stemmed from this publication.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; One major idea that was put forth in ''El Grito'' by its editors was that Mexican Americans, in contrast to other ethnic groups, "have retained their distinct identity and refused to disappear into The Great American Melting Pot."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The consequence of this, said the editors, was that Mexican Americans were kept in an economically and politically impoverished state.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Also in 1967, Ralph Guzmán, a political scientist was hired by [[CSULA|Los Angeles State College]] to conduct a study which would lay the foundation for the creation of a national center for Mexican American studies at [[CSULA|California State College, Los Angeles (CSCLA)]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Both Mexican American and Black Student Unions pressed CSCLA to have ethnic studies classes at this time.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The [[Plan de Santa Barbara]] is generally considered to be the manifesto of Chicano studies.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Drafted in 1969 at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], the plan emphasizes the need for education, and especially higher education to enact Chicano community empowerment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Plan helped to "establish Chicano studies as an entity incorporated into the structures of academia."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, while the Plan articulated a need for education, it did not specify how to create a program of study.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The Plan did, however, lead to the creation of the Chicano Studies Institute in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://oru.research.ucsb.edu/csi/?page_id=6|title = About the Institute|date = |accessdate = 14 May 2015|website = Chicano Studies Institute|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important document in Chicano studies was also produced in 1969. In March of that year, the Chicano Youth Conference held in [[Denver]] produced a plan written by Chicano poet, [[Alurista]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It was called ''[[Plan Espiritual de Aztlán|El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán]]'' (The Spiritual Plan of Aztlán) and it contains a concept of "ethnic nationalism and self-determination."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The idea of the mythic homeland of the Aztec people, [[Aztlán]], is one that unifies the United States and Mexico and correspondingly, united Mexican Americans with a sense of nationalism.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/arizona_quarterly_a_journal_of_american_literature_culture_and_theory/v058/58.1.aranda.pdf|title = Making the Case for New Chicano/a Studies: Recovering Our Alienated Selves|last = Aranda Jr.|first = Jose F.|date = 2002|journal = Arizona Quarterly|doi = 10.1353/arq.2002.0011|pmid = |access-date = 14 May 2015|pages = 127–158|subscription = yes|volume = 58|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, a major Chicano journal began to be published at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA).&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_quarterly/v054/54.4pulido.html|title = In the Spirit of Ernesto Galarza: Recent Publications in Chicano Studies|last = Pulido|first = Alberto Lopez|date = 2002|journal = American Quarterly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 14 May 2015|subscription = yes|volume = 54|issue = 4|pages = 719–729}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal was called ''Aztlán: A Journal of Chicano Studies'' and it was created at first by the students.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The journal, ''Aztlán'', had a big influence on the discourse surrounding Chicano studies and helped "establish and legitimize" the subject in colleges and universities.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The name of the journal came directly from ''El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán'' and under the direction of the historian Juan Gomez-Quiñones, the journal supported and sustained a culture of activism.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Chicano scholars in 1970 also wrote papers for the Chicano Studies Institute which were later published in the journal, ''Epoca''.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; These papers addressed topics such as Chicano curriculum, goals of the educational program and how to achieve academic recognition.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

As Chicano studies programs began to be implemented at universities, it was necessary to provide infrastructure and support. In 1973, the [[University of California, Berkeley]] recognized the need to provide quality library materials to support the Chicano studies programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED164147|title = Providing Library Services for the Chicano Studies Program at the University of California, Berkeley|date = 1973|accessdate = 12 May 2015|website = ERIC|publisher = U.S. Department of Education|last = Padilla|first = Raymond V.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicano scholars also recognized the need to have a "Chicano-controlled academic" space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chicano Studies: The Genesis of a Discipline|last = Soldatenko|first = Michael|publisher = University of Arizona Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780816599530|location = Tucson, Arizona|pages = 94–129|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780816599530/9780816599530-9.pdf|chapter = Chicano Studies as an Academic Discipline, 1975-1982|access-date = 14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers began to study the impact that these new programs had on students, finding that Mexican-American students responded positively to Chicano studies and also to bilingual classes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED118160|title = Chicano Studies and Self-Concept: Implications for the Community Colleges|date = 1975|accessdate = 12 May 2015|website = ERIC|publisher = U.S. Department of Education|last = Gonzalez|first = Jess}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars felt that the philosophy of education in the United States at the time was "inconsistent with the values of the Chicano movement" and that Chicano studies needed to create tools for students to use in the real world and also a new type of research to solve problems.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; It was also important to find ways to recruit Chicano teachers and administration within the schools to support students and research.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Further support for Chicano studies came in the form of the [[National Association of Chicana and Chicano Studies|National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies]] (NACCS) which was created in 1972 in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.naccs.org/naccs/History.asp|title = History of NACCS|date = |accessdate = 14 May 2015|website = National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NACCS allows scholars in Chicano studies to exchange ideas, share research, communicate and it also has an annual conference.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The conferences were important to help bring together scholars and legitimize Chicano studies, since other disciplines have similar annual conferences.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

By 1975, many Chicano studies programs were in place at major universities.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The ten years between 1977 and 1987 saw "tremendous changes in the foundations of Chicano/a studies."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; During this period, Chicano studies began to include more diverse voices that better represented women, homosexuality and other under-represented groups under the umbrella of "Chicano" while also acknowledging the many differences within the group.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  In 1981, the Mexican American Studies and Research Center (MASRC) at the University of Arizona was established. MASRC focused on contemporary applied public policy research on Mexican Americans.  MASRC became a department in 2009. As the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160402085833/http://mas.arizona.edu/ Mexican American Studies Department], it continued public policy research and teaching to addressing issues of concern to Mexican American communities. It currently offers bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and in 2011, began offering a Ph.D. degree in Mexican American Studies. The idea of the "borderland" or [[nepantla]] grew stronger than the idea of Aztlán by the 1980s and Chicanaos celebrated the many different (often conflicting) aspects of themselves.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; ''[[Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza]]'' (1987) by [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa|Gloria Anzaldúa]] both grew out of and signifies this change.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Chicano studies became less about nationalism, and more about belonging to a group and contributing to "something greater."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This shift helped reshape the mission of Chicano studies and gave it "new life" and "new authority."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The 1980s saw more Chicano Studies programs integrated into institutions of higher learning while it also created a "canonical approach" to its studies and "gatekeeping procedures" to evaluate promotions and [[tenure]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, Chicano studies programs helped universities and colleges fulfill [[Affirmative action in the United States|Affirmative Action]] requirements.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; During the mid 1990s, however, a study found that most Chicano studies programs were still very non-uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED380034|title = Current Mexican-American and Chicano Studies Undergraduate College Programs in the United States|date = 1995|accessdate = 12 May 2015|website = ERIC|publisher = U.S. Department of Education|last = Jaramillo|first = James A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the reason that many Chicano studies programs were not consistent in what was studied is that a core curriculum had not yet been formally published.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The first primer of Chicano studies was published in 1980 by Diego Vigil, called ''From Indians to Chicanos: A Sociocultural History''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, there was a lack of Chicano faculty with only 1.2% of faculty at U.S. colleges and universities having any "Hispanic" ethnicity at all in 1985.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Many of the faculty teaching Chicano studies didn't feel that their own programs were "qualitatively sound."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Schools of thought ==
Chicano studies has two major threads, one is considered pragmatic and the other transformational.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_literary_history/v025/25.3.perez-torres.html|title = Chicano Studies's Two Paths|last = Pérez-Torres|first = Rafael|date = 2013|journal = American Literary History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 May 2015|volume = 25|issue = 3|subscription = yes|pages = 683–692}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pragmatic method involves a more activist and "politicized" approach while the transformational method is more in line with working within the traditions of academia, rather than against it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Current Events==
[[File:Arizona Ethnic Studies.jpg|alt=Protesters against HB 2281|thumb|350x350px|Protesters are seen in June 2011 in support of the [[Tucson Unified School District]]'s Mexican-American studies program. A new state law effectively ended the program saying it was divisive.]]
On May 11, 2010, the Governor of [[Arizona]], [[Jan Brewer]], signed House Bill 2281 (also known as HB 2281) which prohibits a school district or charter school from including in its curriculum courses that
#Promote the overthrow of the United States Government
#Promote resentment toward any race or class
#Advocate ethnic solidarity instead of being individuals
#Are designed for a certain ethnicity
while still allowing:
#Native American classes to comply with federal law
#Grouping of classes based on academic performance
#Classes about the history of an ethnic group open to all students
#Classes discussing controversial history
Another provision of the law stated that any school district or charter school breaching its stated provisions would be liable to lose state funding as a public institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/hb2281s.pdf |title=Arizona House Bill 2281 (2010) |format=PDF |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the [[Mexican American Studies Department Programs, Tucson Unified School District|Mexican-American studies program]] as taught by Tucson Unified School District (TUSD) came under scrutiny and was found to be in violation of the law by [[Tom Horne]]. However, an independent audit (paid for by the state of Arizona) was conducted, and found the program was not in breach of HB 2281.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Racial Lens Used to Cull Curriculum in Arizona|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/19/education/racial-lens-used-to-cull-curriculum-in-arizona.html?_r=2|work=nytimes.com|format=article|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With pressure from former Arizona Superintendent [[Tom Horne]], who felt the courses were breaching HB 2281, and after TUSD issued an appeal stating otherwise, Superintendent [[John Huppenthal]] deemed that the course must be disbanded or TUSD would lose funding.&lt;ref name="mex-amer"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mexican-american.org/history/2010/arizona/education/chicano-studies-ban.html | title=Arizona Bans Chicano Studies in Public Schools | first=Tito | last=Rodriguez | publisher=Mexican-American.org | date=May 13, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427090236/http://www.mexican-american.org/history/2010/arizona/education/chicano-studies-ban.html | archivedate=April 27, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in January 2012, the TUSD school board came to a 4-1 decision that the program was to be disbanded in lieu of the district losing state funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-tucson-school-board-daily-show-20120404,0,5593283.story | title= Mexican American studies: 'Daily Show' Segment Strikes a Nerve | author=Castellanos, Dalina | date=April 4, 2012 | publisher= Los Angeles Times | accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further consequence of HB 2281 was opening the door to challenges and limiting classes teaching Chicano studies not just in Arizona, but across the United States.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4362">The '''''chreia''''' or '''''chria''''' ({{lang-el|[[wikt:χρεία#Ancient Greek|χρεία]]}}) was, in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]], both a genre of literature and one of the [[progymnasmata]].

==Definition==

A chreia was a brief, useful (χρεία means "use") anecdote about a particular character.  That is, a chreia was shorter than a narration—often as short as a single sentence—but unlike a maxim, it was attributed to a character.  Usually it conformed to one of a few patterns, the most common being "On seeing..." (ιδών or ''cum vidisset''), "On being asked..." (ἐρωτηθείς or ''interrogatus''), and "He said..." (ἔφη or ''dixit'').&lt;ref&gt;On the meaning of ''chria'' cf. Quintilian, ''Institutio oratoria'' 1,9,4. and Seneca, ''Epistulae morales'' 33,7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

The following chreia, the most common in ancient sources, is illustrative:

{{Quotation|[[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]], on seeing a youth misbehaving, struck his [[pedagogy|paedagogus]], adding "Why do you teach such things?"}}

Chreiai could be silly:

{{Quotation|[[Olympias]], on hearing that her son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] was proclaiming himself the offspring of Zeus, said "Won't this fellow stop slandering me to Hera?"}}

Or solemn:

{{Quotation|A [[Sparta|Laconian]], who had become a prisoner of war and was being sold, on being asked by someone what he could do, said, "Be free."}}

Wise:

{{Quotation|[[Aristeides]], on being asked what justice is, said: "Not desiring the possessions of others."}}

Or witty:

{{Quotation|Diogenes, on being asked why people give to beggars but not to philosophers, said: "Because they suppose they might become lame and blind but they never suppose they might take up philosophy."}}

Or all of these:

{{Quotation|[[Socrates]] the philosopher, when a certain student named Apollodorus said to him, "The Athenians have unjustly condemned you to death," said with a laugh, "But did you want them to do it justly?"}}

As a literary genre the chreia was a subject of collection. Scholars such as [[Plutarch]] or [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] kept their own private collections of chreiai.  Published collections were also available.  The chreia is primarily known, however, for its role in education.  Students were introduced to simple chreiai almost as soon as they could read.  Later they practiced the complex grammar of Greek by putting these chreiai through changes of [[voice (grammar)|voice]] and [[grammatical tense|tense]].  As one of the last stages in their preparation for rhetoric—this is where chreiai serve as one of the progymnasmata—they would elaborate the theme of a chreiai into a formal eight-paragraph essay.  The student would praise, paraphrase, explain, contrast, compare, provide an example, make a judgment, and, in conclusion, exhort the reader.

Chreiai are also common in the [[New Testament]], mainly in the [[Gospel]]s. An example is in Mark 13: 1-2:

{{Quotation|And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here! And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down (King James Version.)}}

The famous passage in Luke 20: 21-25 also has the typical structure of a chreia, though its length is somewhat unusual:

{{Quotation|And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly: Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no? But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me? Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's. And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's. (King James Version.)}}

The notion of "policy sciences" may have different connotations. According to [[Harold Lasswell|Harold Laswell]] (1971), "policy sciences are concerned with the knowledge of and in the decision processes of the public and civic order".&lt;ref&gt;Laswell, H.D. (1971). A Preview of Policy Sciences. American Elsevier.  Accessed through http://www.policysciences.org/classics/preview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Knowledge of decision processes points to the empirical and scientific understanding of the how policies are made and executed.  Empirical knowledge pertains to those generated through scientific inquiry ad observation as applied to decision processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.policysciences.org/policysciences.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111103911/http://www.policysciences.org/policysciences.php |archivedate=2014-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy sciences provide an integrated and comprehensive approach for addressing issues and problems at all levels in ways that help to clarify and secure the common interest. Helping people make better decisions is the central objective of the policy sciences, and the fundamental goal is to foster a commonwealth of human dignity for all. Alexander G. Flor,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.academia.edu/578845/Development_Communication_and_the_Policy_Sciences|title = Journal of Development Communication|last = |first = |date = 1991|journal = |accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ph.D., one of the esteemed development communicators in the [[Philippines]] and also a full professor at the [[University of the Philippines Open University]], points out that "policy scientists or policy analysts are involved not only in the scientific design, formulation, analysis and evaluation of policies. They are also concerned with the study of the policy making process itself". Flor advocates that "if indeed communication and information are to be efficiently and effectively utilized in the development process, then policies are needed to direct their use for the achievement of the highest social good".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The term "policy sciences" is in plural form to emphasize its interdisciplinary nature.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (1978), cited in Flor, Alexander (1991). Development Communication and the Policy Sciences. Journal of Development Communication. Kuala Lumpur: Asian Institute of Development Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;  It recognizes the multiplicity of factors affecting certain problems and multi-dimensions of certain phenomenon that is subject to decision processes.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, Alexander (1991). Development Communication and the Policy Sciences. Journal of Development Communication. Kuala Lumpur: Asian Institute of Development Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, the emphasis of policy sciences is on applying scientific or empirical evidences in understanding problems so that more realistic, responsive and effective interventions are identified and implemented.  Since a problem is multi-dimensional, various scientific disciplines are needed to form a comprehensive analysis of a certain phenomenon.

==Policy analysis styles==
Dutch policy science experts Mayers, van Daalen and Bots&lt;ref name=Mayers&gt;{{Cite journal|url =http://www.ced.cl/ced/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/mayer-et-al_2004.pdf.|title =International Journal of Technology Policy and Management|last =|first =|date =2004|journal =|accessdate =|doi =|pmid =}}{{dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=Ost316 |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed policy analysis styles which can be helpful to communication policy analysts and organizational policy analysts, among others. These styles are as follow:

# Rational &lt;br/&gt; This style is "shaped to a large degree by assumptions about knowledge and reality, and by a relatively large distance between the object and subject of study."
# Argumentative &lt;br/&gt; Assumes that "when analyzing policy, it is important to devote attention to aspects related to the language game that takes place around a policy problem or issue".
# Client advice &lt;br/&gt; "Besides knowledge and insights gained through research, policy analysis is largely a question of politico-strategic insight and skills including client-analyst communication."
# Participatory &lt;br/&gt; Assumed that "not all sections of the population have ready access to policy systems; researchers, economic elites, institutionalized non-governmental organizations and politicians dominate policy discussions and decisions about major social issues."
# Process &lt;br/&gt; This is based on the assumption that "substantive aspects of a policy problem are, in fact, coordinate or perhaps even subordinate to the procedural aspects of a policy problem. The analyst or process manager creates 'loose coupling' of procedural aspects and substantive aspects of a problem."
# Interactive &lt;br/&gt;This style assumes that "individuals – experts, analysts, clients, stakeholders and target groups – have or may have differing views of the 'same' policy problem. An insight relevant to policy can be obtained by bringing about a confrontation and interaction of different views."

The styles mentioned above are based on underlying values and orientations, which determine in what way a policy analyst or others will view the quality of the policy analysis study and the criteria that will be applied to examine it. According to Mayer et al.&lt;ref name=Mayers/&gt; these criteria can be made explicit by addressing the following questions:

* Rational style. What is good knowledge?
* Argumentative style. What is good for the debate?
* Client advice style. What is good for the client/problem owner?
* Participatory style. What is good for democratic society?
* Process style. What is good for the process?
* Interactive style. What is good for mutual understanding?

==Theoretical approaches in development communication==

Today, development communication has shifted from modernization and dependency theories to more normative and holistic approaches. The modernization paradigm, which became dominant in the 1945 to 1965, supported the transfer of technology and the socio-political culture of the developed societies to the traditional societies. Development then was defined as economic growth. The main idea of the modernization perspective is the idea of evolution where development is conceived as directional and cumulative, predetermined and irreversible, progressive, and immanent with reference to the nation state. Here, the developed western societies seem to be the ultimate goals which the less developed societies strive to reach. These two sectors, the traditional and the modern, were regarded as two stages of development and in time the differences between them were to disappear because of the natural inclination towards equilibrium. The problem was to remove the barriers, which were only to be found in the traditional society. These barriers can be removed through at least five mechanisms:

# demonstration, whereby the developing world tries to catch up with the more developed by adopting more advanced methods and techniques; 
# fusion, which is the combination and integration of distinct modern methods; 
# compression, whereby the developing countries attempt to accomplish the task of development in less time than it took the developed world; 
# prevention that is, by learning from the 'errors' made by the developed countries; and 
# adaptation of modern practices to the local environment and culture.

Accordingly, the means of modernization were the massive transfer of capital, ideology, technology, and know-how. The measures of progress were G.N.P., literacy, industrial base, urbanization, and the like, all quantifiable criteria.

Communication theories such as the diffusion of innovations, the two-step-flow, or the 'extension' approaches are congruent with the modernization theory. According to Everett Rogers, one of the leading proponents of the diffusion theory, this perspective implies that the role of communication was (1) to transfer technological innovations from development agencies to their clients, and (2) to create an appetite for change through raising a climate for modernization' among the members of the public (Rogers, 1986).

===Diffusion model===

The 1950s was the decade of the communication model. One of the earliest and most influential of these came not from the social sciences or humanities, but from information engineering. Shannon and Weaver's linear source-transmitter-channel-receiver-destination model eclipsed the earlier, more organic, psychological and sociological approaches. Lasswell, Hofland, Newcomb, Schramm, Westley and Mclean, Berlo, and others each devised a model of communication as they conceived it. This profusion of communication models may be attributed to three reasons. Firstly, because they identified communication basically as the transfer of information, they were amenable to empirical methodology, thus establishing the basis for communication as a distinct and legitimate science. Secondly, theorists focused on the efficiency, or effects, of communication, thereby holding vast promise for manipulation or control of message receivers by vested interests, or the sources. Finally, the communication models fit neatly into the nature and mechanics of mass or mediated communication, an emergent and powerful force at that time. Therefore, in these years, the discipline of communication was largely, and most importantly, its effects. The hypodermic needle effects of media were to be a quick and efficient answer to a myriad of social ills.

Building primarily on sociological research in agrarian societies, Everett Rogers (1973) stressed the adoption and diffusion processes of cultural innovation. Modernization is here conceived as a process of diffusion whereby individuals move from a traditional way of life to a more complex, more technically developed and more rapidly changing way of life. This approach is therefore concerned with the process of diffusion and adoption of innovations in a more systematic and planned way. He distinguishes between five phases in the diffusion process: awareness, interest, evaluation, trial and adoption. The role of the mass media is concentrated on the first stage of the process, whereas personal sources are most important at the evaluation stage in the adoption process (Rogers, 1962). In a second edition of his work (Rogers,1973), there are only four crucial steps left in the process of diffusion and adoption: (a) the knowledge of the innovation itself (information), (b) the communication of the innovation (persuasion), (c) the decision to adopt or reject the innovation (adoption or rejection), and (d) the confirmation of the innovation by the individual.

Three more approaches contributed to the success of this diffusion model: that is, a psycho-sociological, institutional and technological interpretation of communication for modernization. The psycho-sociological or behavioristic perspective on communication and modernization is particularly concerned with the individual value and attitude change. Rokeach (1966) defined attitude as a relatively enduring organization of beliefs about an object or situation predisposing one to respond in some preferential manner. Attitude change would then be "a change in predisposition, the change being either a change in the organization or structure of beliefs, or a change in the content of one or more of the beliefs entering into the attitude organization" (Rokeach, 1966; cited in Servaes, 2002). Central in the view of Daniel Lerner (1958), one of the main representatives of this communication for modernization paradigm, is the concept of 'empathy'—the capacity to see oneself in the other fellow's situation. The major hypothesis is that high empathy is predominantly the personal style in modern society, which is distinctively industrial, urban, literate and participant.

Wilbur Schramm (1964), building on Lerner's idea, took a closer look on the perceived connection between mass communication and modernizing practices and institutions. The modern communication media supplement and complement the mobility multipliers—the oral channels of a traditional society. Their development runs parallel to the development of other institutions of modern society, such as schools and industry, and is closely related to some of the indices of general social and economic growth, such as literacy, per capita income, and urbanization. So he claimed that a developing country should give special attention to combining mass media with interpersonal communication (Schramm, 1964; cited in Servaes, 2002).

===Participatory model===

The participatory model incorporates the concepts in the emerging framework of multiplicity. It stresses the importance of cultural identity of local communities and of democratization and participation at all levels—international, national, local and individual. It points to a strategy, not merely inclusive of, but largely emanating from, the traditional receivers. Paulo Freire (1983; cited in Servaes, 2002) refers to this as the right of all people to individually and collectively speak their word. Consequently, no one can say a true word alone—nor can he say it for another, in a prescriptive act which robs others of their words. In order to share information, knowledge, trust, and commitment a right attitude in development projects participation is very important in any decision making process for development. This entails a new attitude for overcoming stereotyped thinking and to promote more understanding of diversity and plurality, with full respect for the dignity and equality of peoples living in different conditions and acting in different ways. (International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems, 1980; cited in Servaes, 2002) This model stresses reciprocal collaboration throughout all levels of participation. Listening to what the others say, respecting the counterpart's attitude, and having mutual trust are needed.

Participation involves the more equitable sharing of both political and economic power, which often decreases the advantage of certain groups. Structural change involves the redistribution of power. In mass communication areas, many communication experts agree that structural change should occur first in order to establish participatory communication policies. In fact, Mowlana and Wilson (1987) made this clear by stating that "Communications policies are basically derivatives of the political, cultural and economic conditions and institutions under which they operate. They tend to legitimize the existing power relations in society, and therefore, they cannot be substantially changed unless there are fundamental structural changes in society that can alter these power relationships themselves".

Since dialogue and face-to-face interaction is inherent in participation, the development communicator usually spend more time in the field as rapport and trust take time to develop. This is the reason why continued contact, meeting commitments, keeping promises, and follows up between visits are important. Development of social trust precedes task trust. Both parties will need patience. It is important to note that treating people the way we would like to be treated, we learn to work as a team, and this brings about rural commitment and motivation too. Further, honesty, trust, and commitment from the higher ups bring honesty, trust, and commitment for the grass-roots as well bringing about true participation. And true participation brings about appropriate policies and planning for developing a country within its cultural and environmental framework. Consequently, the perspective on communication also changes. It is more concerned with process and context, that is, on the exchange of meanings, and on the importance of this process, namely, the social relational patterns and social institutions that are the result of and are determined by the process. With this shift in focus, one is no longer attempting to create a need for the information one is disseminating, but one is rather disseminating information for which there is a need. Experts and development workers rather respond than dictate, they choose what is relevant to the context in which they are working. The emphasis is on information exchange rather than on the persuasion in the diffusion model.

==Two major approaches to participatory communication==
There are two major approaches to participatory communication. The first is the dialogical pedagogy of Paulo Freire, and the second involves the ideas of access, participation and self-management articulated in the Unesco debates of the 1970s. Every communication project which calls itself participatory accepts these principles of democratic communication.

The Freirian argument works by a dual theoretical strategy. It is argued that subjugated peoples must be treated as fully human subjects in any political process. This implies dialogical communication. Although inspired to some extent by Sartre's existentialism—a respect for the autonomous personhood of each human being—the more important source is a theology that demands respect for otherness—in this case that of another human being. The second strategy is a moment of utopian hope derived from the early Marx that the human species has a destiny which is more than life as a fulfillment of material needs. Also from Marx is an insistence on collective solutions. Individual opportunity, Freire stresses, is no solution to general situations of poverty and cultural subjugation.

The second discourse about participatory communication is the Unesco language about self-management, access and participation from the 1977 meeting in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The final report of that meeting defines the terms in the following way: Access refers to the use of media for public service. It may be defined in terms of the opportunities available to the public to choose varied and relevant programs and to have a means of feedback to transmit its reactions and demands to production organizations.

Participation implies a higher level of public involvement in communication systems. It includes the involvement of the public in the production process, and also in the management and planning of communication systems. It may be no more than representation and consultation of the public in decision-making. On the other hand, self-management is the most advanced form of participation. In this case, the public exercises the power of decision-making within communication enterprises and is also fully involved in the formulation of communication policies and plans. These ideas are important and widely accepted as a normative theory of alternative communication: it must involve access and participation. However, one should note some differences from Freire. The Unesco discourse includes the idea of a gradual progression. Some amount of access may be allowed, but self-management may be postponed until sometime in the future. The Unesco discourse talks in neutral terms about "the public". Freire talked about the oppressed. Finally, the Unesco discourse puts the main focus on the institution. Participatory radio means a radio station that is self-managed by those participating in it.

'''Dialogflow''' (formerly Api.ai, Speaktoit) is a Google-owned developer of [[human–computer interaction]] technologies based on natural language conversations. The company is best known for creating the [[Assistant (by Speaktoit)]], a virtual buddy for [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], and [[Windows Phone]] [[smartphone]]s that performs tasks and answers users' question in a natural language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Digital Personal Assistant Problem Siri Still Hasn't Solved|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3000253/digital-personal-assistant-problem-siri-still-hasnt-solved|publisher=''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]''|accessdate=24 October 2012|date=8 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaktoit has also created a natural language processing engine that incorporates conversation context like dialogue history, location and user preferences.

In May 2012, Speaktoit received a venture round (funding terms undisclosed) from [[Intel Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speaktoit Secures Funding From Intel|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/article/2012-05-25/ajHvFvFOrqxI.html|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=20 October 2012|date=25 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, Speaktoit closed their Series B funding led by Motorola Solutions Venture Capital with participation from new investor Plug and Play Ventures and existing backers Intel Capital and Alpine Technology Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speaktoit Scores $2.6M to Put Virtual Assistant Into Cars, Robots and Wearables|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/07/18/speaktoit-scores-2-6m-to-put-virtual-assistant-into-cars-robots-and-wearables/|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|accessdate=6 October 2014|date=18 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Speaktoit released api.ai (the voice-enabling engine that powers Assistant) to third-party developers, allowing the addition of voice interfaces to apps based on [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], [[HTML5]], and [[PhoneGap|Cordova]].&lt;ref name="thenextweb"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wierema|first=Sam |title=Build your own Siri: Api.ai offers voice integration for all|url=https://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/09/16/build-your-own-siri-api-ai-offers-voice-integration-for-all/|publisher=The Next Web|date=16 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=api.ai Documentation|url=http://api.ai/docs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SDK's contain voice recognition, natural language understanding, and text-to-speech. api.ai offers a web interface to build and test conversation scenarios. The platform is based on the natural language processing engine built by Speaktoit for its [[Assistant (by Speaktoit)|Assistant]] application.&lt;ref name="thenextweb"/&gt; Api.ai allows [[Internet of Things]] developers to include natural language voice interfaces in their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tolentino|first=Mellisa |title=New platforms, upgrades simplify life for IoT developers|url=http://siliconangle.com/blog/2014/09/19/new-platforms-upgrades-simplify-life-for-iot-developers/|publisher=Silicon Angle|date=19 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistant and Speaktoit's websites now redirect to api.ai's [http://api.ai/ website], which redirects to the Dialogflow [https://dialogflow.com/ website].

Google bought the company in September 2016&lt;ref name=tc&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/19/google-acquires-api-ai-a-company-helping-developers-build-bots-that-arent-awful-to-talk-to/&lt;/ref&gt; and was initially known as API.AI; it provides tools to developers building apps ("Actions") for the [[Google Assistant]] [[Virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)|virtual assistant]].&lt;ref&gt;api.ai&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed on 10 October 2017 as Dialogflow.&lt;ref name="dialogflow"&gt;[https://blog.dialogflow.com/post/apiai-new-name-dialogflow-new-features/ Introducing Dialogflow, the new name for api.ai]&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization discontinued the Assistant app on December 15, 2016.

Voice and [[conversational interfaces]] created with Dialogflow works with a wide range of devices including phones, wearables, cars, speakers and other smart devices. It supports 14+ languages including Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Ukrainian. Dialogflow supports an array of services that are relevant to entertainment and hospitality industries. Dialogflow also includes an analytics tool that can measure the engagement or session metrics like usage patterns, latency issues, etc.

[[Image:Beaver.jpg|thumb|[[Beavers]] are the prototypical ecosystem engineer because of the effects their [[beaver dam|dams]] have on [[Channel (geography)|channel]] flow, [[geomorphology]], and ecology.]]
[[Image:Rockfish around kelp Monterey Bay Aquarium.jpg|thumb|upright|Kelp are autogenic ecosystem engineers, by building the necessary structure for kelp forests]]

An '''ecosystem engineer''' is any [[organism]] that creates, significantly modifies, maintains or destroys a [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. These organisms can have a large impact on the [[species richness]] and landscape-level [[heterogeneity]] of an area.&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = Justin P | last2 = Jones | first2 = Clive G | last3 = Flecker | first3 = Alexander S | year = 2002 | title = An ecosystem engineer, the beaver, increases species richness at the landscape scale | url = | journal = Ecosystems Ecology | volume = 132 | issue = 1| pages = 96–101 | doi=10.1007/s00442-002-0929-1| pmid = 28547281 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, ecosystem engineers are important for maintaining the health and stability of the environment they are living in. Since all organisms impact the environment they live in &lt;!-- not a mistake--&gt;in one way or another, it has been proposed that the term "ecosystem engineers" be used only for [[keystone species]] whose behavior very strongly affects other organisms.&lt;ref name= Haemig&gt;[Haemig PD (2012). Ecosystem Engineers: wildlife that create, modify and maintain habitats.  ECOLOGY.INFO #12]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Jones et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = CG | last2 = Lawton | first2 = JH | last3 = Shachak | first3 = M | year = 1994 | title = Organisms as ecosystem engineers | url = | journal = Oikos | volume = 69 | issue = 3| pages = 373–386 | doi=10.2307/3545850| jstor = 3545850 }}&lt;/ref&gt; identified two different types of ecosystem engineers:

===Allogenic engineers===

Allogenic engineers modify the [[environment (biophysical)]] by mechanically changing living or nonliving materials from one form to another. [[Beaver]]s are the original model for ecosystem engineers; in the process of [[clearcutting]] and damming, beavers alter their [[ecosystem]] extensively. The addition of a dam will change both the distribution and the abundance of many organisms in the area.&lt;ref name= Haemig /&gt; [[Caterpillars]] are another example in that by creating shelters from leaves, they are also creating shelters for other organisms which may occupy them either simultaneously or subsequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = CG | last2 = Lawton | first2 = JH | last3 = Shachak | first3 = M | year = 1997 | title = Positive and negative effects of organisms as physical ecosystem engineers | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 78 | issue = 7| pages = 1946–1957 | doi=10.2307/2265935| jstor = 2265935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional example may be that of [[woodpecker]]s or other birds who create holes in trees for them to nest in. Once these birds are through with them, the holes are used by other species of birds or mammals for housing.&lt;ref name= Haemig /&gt;

===Autogenic engineers===

Autogenic engineers modify the environment by modifying themselves. Trees are a good example, because as they grow, their trunks and branches create habitats for other living things; these may include squirrels, birds or insects among others. In the tropics, [[liana]]s connect trees, which allow many animals to travel exclusively through the forest canopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.eoearth.org/article/Ecosystem_engineer|title= Ecosystem engineer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
Being able to identify ecosystem engineers in an environment can be important when looking at the influence these individuals may have over other organisms living in the same environment – especially in terms of resource availability.&lt;ref name= Chapman&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chapman | first1 = Colin A | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = Are primates ecosystem engineers? | doi = 10.1007/s10764-012-9645-9 | journal = International Journal of Primatology | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 1–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of some ecosystem engineers has been linked to higher species richness at the [[landscape]] level. By modifying the habitat, organisms like the beaver create more habitat heterogeneity and so can support species not found elsewhere.&lt;ref name= Wright /&gt; Thoughts may be that similar to other [[umbrella species]] by conserving an ecosystem engineer you may be able to protect the overall diversity of a landscape.&lt;ref name= Wright /&gt; Beavers have also been shown to maintain habitats in such a way as to protect the rare [[Saint Francis' satyr]] butterfly and increase plant diversity.&lt;ref name= Bartel&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bartel | first1 = Rebecca A | last2 = Haddad | first2 = Nick M | last3 = Wright | first3 = Justin P | year = 2010 | title = Ecosystem engineers maintain a rare species of butterfly and increase plant diversity | url = | journal = Oikos | volume = 119 | issue = 5| pages = 883–890 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.18080.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biodiversity]] may also be affected by ecosystem engineer's ability to increase the complexity of processes within an ecosystem, potentially allowing greater [[species richness]] and diversity in the local environments. As an example, beavers have the capacity to modify riparian forest and expand wetland habitats, which results in an increase of the diversity of the habitats by allowing a greater number of species to inhabit the landscape. [[Coral reef|Coral-reef habitats]], created by the ecosystem engineer coral species, hold some of the highest abundances of aquatic species in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Biodiversity effects of ecosystem engineers are stronger on more complex ecosystem processes|journal = Ecology|date = 1 September 2013|issn = 1939-9170|pages = 1977–1985|volume = 94|issue = 9|doi = 10.1890/12-1385.1|language = en|first = Adriano|last = Caliman|first2 = Luciana S.|last2 = Carneiro|first3 = João J. F.|last3 = Leal|first4 = Vinicius F.|last4 = Farjalla|first5 = Reinaldo L.|last5 = Bozelli|first6 = Francisco A.|last6 = Esteves}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduced species as ecosystem engineers==
Species are able to be transported across all parts of the world by humans or human-made vessels at boundless rates resulting in foreign ecosystem engineers changing the dynamics of species interactions and the possibility for engineering to occur in locations that would not have been accessible by engineers without the mediation by humans.

[[Introduced species]], which may be [[invasive species]], are often ecosystem engineers. [[Kudzu]], a leguminous plant introduced to the southeast U.S., changes the distribution and number of animal and bird species in the areas it invades. It also crowds out native plant species. The [[zebra mussel]] is an ecosystem engineer in North America. By providing refuge from [[predator]]s, it encourages the growth of freshwater [[invertebrate]]s through increasing microhabitats. Light penetration into infected lakes also improves the ecosystem, resulting in an increase in [[algae]]. In contrast to the benefits some ecosystem engineers can cause, invasive species often have the reverse effect.

[[File:Gordon Dam.jpg|thumb|Gordon Dam]]

==Humans as ecosystem engineers==
Humans are thought to be one of the most dramatic ecosystem engineers. [[Niche construction]] has been prevalent since the earliest days of human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Bruce D.|date=30 March 2007|title=The Ultimate Ecosystem Engineers|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/315/5820/1797|journal=Science|language=en|volume=315|issue=5820|pages=1797–1798|doi=10.1126/science.1137740|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17395815}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through urban development, agricultural practices, logging, damming and mining, humans have changed the way they interact with the environment. 
This interaction is more studied in the field of [[human ecology]].

Due to the complexity of many communities and ecosystems, restoration projects are often difficult. Ecosystem engineers have been proposed as a means to restore a given area to its previous state. While ideally these would all be natural agents, with today's level of development some form of human intervention may be necessary as well. In addition to being able to assist in [[restoration ecology]], ecosystem engineers may be a helpful agent in [[invasive species]] management.&lt;ref name= Byers&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Byers | first1 = James E | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2006 | title = Using ecosystem engineers to restore ecological systems | url = | journal = Ecology and Evolution | volume = 21 | issue = 9| pages = 493–500 | doi=10.1016/j.tree.2006.06.002| pmid = 16806576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New fields are developing which focus on restoring those ecosystems which have been disrupted or destroyed by human activities as well as developing ecosystems that are sustainable with both human and ecological values.&lt;ref name= Mitsch&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mitsch | first1 = William J | year = 2012 | title = What is ecological engineering? | url = | journal = Ecological Engineering | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 5–12 | doi=10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.04.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Terrestrial environments===

Besides the previously mentioned beaver acting as an ecosystem engineer, other terrestrial animals do the same. This may be through feeding habits, migration patterns or other behaviors that result in more permanent changes.

Research has suggested primates as ecosystem engineers as a result of their feeding strategies – [[frugivory]] and [[folivory]] – making them act as seed dispersers.&lt;ref name= Chapman /&gt; As a whole primates are very abundant and feed on a large quantity of fruit that is then distributed around their territory. Elephants have also been designated ecosystem engineers as they cause very large changes to their environment whether it be through feeding, digging or migratory behavior.&lt;ref name= Hayes&gt;[Hayes, Gary. (2012). Elephants (and extinct relatives) as earth-movers and ecosystem engineers. Geomorphology 157–158: 99–107.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only animals are ecosystem engineers. Fungi are able to connect regions that are distant from one another and translocate nutrients between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boddy|first1=Lynne|last2=Watkinson|first2=Sarah C.|title=Wood decomposition, higher fungi, and their role in nutrient redistribution|journal=Canadian Journal of Botany|date=31 December 1995|volume=73|issue=S1|pages=1377–1383|doi=10.1139/b95-400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doing so they create nutritional niches for xylophagous invertebrates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Filipiak|first1=Michał|last2=Sobczyk|first2=Łukasz|last3=Weiner|first3=January|title=Fungal Transformation of Tree Stumps into a Suitable Resource for Xylophagous Beetles via Changes in Elemental Ratios|journal=Insects|date=9 April 2016|volume=7|issue=2|pages=13|doi=10.3390/insects7020013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Filipiak|first1=Michał|last2=Weiner|first2=January|last3=Wilson|first3=Richard A.|title=How to Make a Beetle Out of Wood: Multi-Elemental Stoichiometry of Wood Decay, Xylophagy and Fungivory|journal=PLoS ONE|date=23 December 2014|volume=9|issue=12|pages=e115104|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0115104|pmid=25536334|pmc=4275229}}&lt;/ref&gt; supply trees with N translocated from previously predated animals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wardle|first1=D. A.|title=Ecological Linkages Between Aboveground and Belowground Biota|journal=Science|date=11 June 2004|volume=304|issue=5677|pages=1629–1633|doi=10.1126/science.1094875|pmid=15192218}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even form an "underground pipeline" that redistributes carbon between trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=T.|last2=Siegwolf|first2=R. T. W.|last3=Korner|first3=C.|title=Belowground carbon trade among tall trees in a temperate forest|journal=Science|date=14 April 2016|volume=352|issue=6283|pages=342–344|doi=10.1126/science.aad6188|pmid=27081070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus fungi are engineers controlling nutrient cycles in ecosystems.

[[Prairie dogs]] are another terrestrial form of allogenic ecosystem engineers due to the fact that the species has the ability to perform substantial modifications by burrowing and turning soil. They are able to influence soils and vegetation of the landscape while providing underground corridors for [[arthropods]], [[avians]], other small [[mammals]], and [[reptiles]]. This has a positive effect on species richness and diversity of their habitats which results in the prairie dogs being labelled as keystone species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Bruce W.|last2=Augustine|first2=David J.|last3=Sedgwick|first3=James A.|last4=Lubow|first4=Bruce C.|date=1 February 2013|title=Ecosystem engineering varies spatially: a test of the vegetation modification paradigm for prairie dogs|journal=Ecography|language=en|volume=36|issue=2|pages=230–239|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07614.x|issn=1600-0587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eilat Scuba Parrotfish.JPG|thumb|Parrotfish]]

===Marine environments===

In marine environments, [[filter feeders]] and [[plankton]] are ecosystem engineers because they alter turbidity and light penetration, controlling the depth at which [[photosynthesis]] can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berke | first1 = Sarah K | year = 2012 | title = Functional Groups of Ecosystem Engineers: A Proposed Classification with Comments on Current Issues | doi = 10.1093/icb/icq077 | pmid = 21558195 | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 50 | issue = 2| pages = 147–157 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn limits the primary productivity of [[benthic zone|benthic]] and [[pelagic zone|pelagic]] habitats&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abrahams | first1 = MV | last2 = Kattenfeld | first2 = MG | year = 1997 | title = The role of turbidity as a constraint on predator–prey interactions in aquatic environments | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 169–74 | doi=10.1007/s002650050330}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influences consumption patterns between [[trophic level|trophic]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hartman | first1 = EJ | last2 = Abrahams | first2 = MV | year = 2000 | title = Sensory compensation and the detection of predators: the interaction between chemical and visual information | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 267 | issue = 1443| pages = 571–75 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1039| pmid = 10787160 | pmc = 1690576 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of ecosystem engineers in marine environments would be [[scleractinian corals]] as they create the framework for the habitat most coral-reef organisms depend on.&lt;ref name=Wild&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wild | first1 = Christian | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2011 | title = Climate change impedes scleractinian corals as primary reef ecosystem engineers | doi = 10.1071/mf10254 | journal = Marine and Freshwater Research | volume = 62 | issue = 2| pages = 205–215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ecosystem engineers such as coral have help maintaining their environment. [[Parrotfish]] often help maintain coral reefs as they feed on macroalgae that competes with the coral.&lt;ref name= Bozec&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bozec | first1 = Yves-Marie | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = Reciprocal facilitation and non-linearity maintain habitat engineering on coral reefs | url = | journal = Oikos | volume = 122 | issue = 3| pages = 428–440 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0706.2012.20576.x| citeseerx = 10.1.1.457.9673 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As this relationship is mutually beneficial, a positive feedback cycle is formed between the two organisms, making them both responsible for creating and maintaining coral reef ecosystems.&lt;ref name= Bozec /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6039">An '''evolutionarily significant unit''' ('''ESU''') is a population of [[organism]]s that is considered distinct for purposes of [[Conservation ethic|conservation]]. Delineating ESUs is important when considering conservation action. 
This term can apply to any [[species]], [[subspecies]], [[Race (biology)|geographic race]], or [[population]]. Often the term "species" is used rather than ESU, even when an ESU is more technically considered a subspecies or variety rather than a [[species|biological species]] proper. In [[Marine biology|marine animals]] the term "stock" is often used as well.

==Definition==
Definitions of an ESU generally{{weasel-inline|date=December 2016}} include at least one of the following criteria:&lt;ref name="Conner"&gt;Jeffrey Conner, Daniel Hartl. ''A Primer of Ecological Genetics''. 2004, {{ISBN|978-0878932023}}{{page needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Current geographic separation,
# Genetic differentiation at [[Genetic_monitoring#Types|neutral markers]] among related ESUs caused by [[Population bottleneck|past restriction of gene flow]], or
# Locally adapted [[Phenotype|phenotypic traits]] caused by differences in [[Natural selection|selection]].

Criterion 2 considers the gene flow between populations, measured by [[fixation index|F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;]]. A high degree of differentiation between two populations among genes that provide no adaptive advantage to either population (known as ''neutral markers'') implies a lack of gene flow, showing that [[Genetic drift|random drift]] has occurred in isolation from other populations. Very few migrants per generation are needed to prevent strong differentiation of neutral markers. Even a single migrant per generation may be enough for neutral markers to show gene flow between populations, making it difficult to differentiate the populations through neutral markers.

Criterion 3 does not consider neutral genetic markers, instead looking at locally adapted traits of the population. Local adaptations may be present even with some gene flow from other populations, and even when there is little differentiation at neutral markers among ESUs. Reciprocal transplantation experiments are necessary to test for genetic differentiation for phenotypic traits, and differences in selection gradients across habitats. Such experiments are generally more difficult than the fixation index tests of criterion 2, and may be impossible for very rare or [[endangered species]].

For example, [[Hemileuca maia|Cryan's buckmoth]] (''Hemileuca maia'') feeds only on the herb ''[[Menyanthes trifoliata]]'', commonly known as buckbean, and while indistinguishable morphologically from related buckmoths, and not differentiated at the genetic markers tested, the moth is highly adapted to its host plant, having 100% survivorship on ''Menyanthes'', while close genetic relatives all died when reared on the plant.&lt;ref name=Buckmoth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=John|first1=Legge|last2=Richard|first2=Roush|last3=Rob|first3=Desalle|last4=Alfried|first4=Vogler|last5=Bernie|first5=May|title=Genetic Criteria for Establishing Evolutionarily Significant Units in Cryan's Buckmoth|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1996.10010085.x |journal=Conservation Biology|date=February 1996|volume=10|issue=1|pages=85–98|ref=http://animalscience.ucdavis.edu/gvl/Conservation_Genetics_Fund/Publications_4_files/1996%20-%20Cryan%27s%20buckmoth.pdf}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 January 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In this case gene flow was sufficient to reduce differentiation at neutral markers, but did not prevent local [[host adaptation]].

Both criteria 2 and 3 have the problem that there is no clear dichotomy between ESU and not-ESU, as genetic differentiation between populations forms a continuum, prompting a contention for consideration of both genetic and ecological processes in identifying ESUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Crandall | display-authors=etal   | year=2000 | title=Considering evolutionary processes in conservation biology | journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution | volume=15 | issue=| pages=290–295 | doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(00)01876-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the different approaches to designating ESUs each have their benefits, and the need and form of management prescriptions may vary across contexts, some support an "adaptive" approach to identification of ESUs, for instance suggesting consideration of facets from numerous designation methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fraser | first1= | last2=Bernatchez | year=2001 | title=Adaptive evolutionary conservation: towards a unified concept for defining conservation units | journal=Molecular Ecology | volume=10 | issue=| pages=2741–2752 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-294x.2001.t01-1-01411.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study of [[transsexualism]], the [[essentialism|essentialist]] idea of a '''feminine essence''' refers to the proposal that [[Trans woman|male-to-female transsexuals]] are females trapped in male bodies.  This idea has been interpreted in many senses, as a female mind, spirit, soul, personality, etc., as well as in more literal senses such as having a female brain structure; it is also a [[psychological narrative]], that is, a self-description of how some transsexuals see themselves, or of how they may portray themselves to qualify for certain medical treatments.

According to sexologist [[J. Michael Bailey]] and Kiira Triea, "the predominant cultural understanding of male-to-female transsexualism is that all male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals are, essentially, women trapped in men's bodies."  They reject the idea, claiming that "The persistence of the predominant cultural understanding, while explicable, is damaging to science and to many transsexuals."&lt;ref name=Bailey2007&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bailey J.

The great majority of patients understand full well that this is a ''[[wikt:façon de parler|façon de parler]],'' not a literal statement of fact, and are not delusional in any normal sense of the word."&lt;ref name="UTorontoRounds2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autogynephilia.org/psychiatry_rounds.pdf|title=Psychiatry Rounds: The case for and against publicly funded transsexual surgery|date=April 2000|publisher=Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto Centre for Addiction and Mental Health; Toronto, Ontario|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304092619/http://www.autogynephilia.org/psychiatry_rounds.pdf|archive-date=2012-03-04|volume=4|issue=2|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminine essence idea has been described under several names, and there is no authoritative, widely accepted definition.&lt;ref name=Blanchard2008 /&gt;  It was called the ''feminine essence narrative'' by [[Alice Dreger]] in 2008,&lt;ref name=Dreger2008&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dreger AD |title=The Controversy Surrounding The Man Who Would Be Queen: A Case History of the Politics of Science, Identity, and Sex in the Internet Age |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=366–421 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18431641 |doi=10.1007/s10508-007-9301-1 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/0753m756162q4236/fulltext.pdf |pmc=3170124}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''feminine essence theory'' by Ray Blanchard, who formulated the concept into a set of logical propositions.&lt;ref name=Blanchard2008&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blanchard R |title=Deconstructing the feminine essence narrative |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=434–8; discussion 505–10 |date=June 2008 |pmid= 18431630|doi=10.1007/s10508-008-9328-y |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other names include ''[[Harry Benjamin]] syndrome'', after one of the early sexologists whose early writings about the nature of transsexualism, along with those of psychiatrist [[David O.

|quote=As the medical literature on transsexuals emerged, the doctors and scientists involved drew, as Ulrichs had, a distinction between the sex in the mind, as seen in the sense of self, and the sex in the body, as generally evidenced in the genitals.  Cauldwell referred to individuals who were "physically of one sex and apparently psychologically of the opposite sex."  Hamburger and his colleagues wrote of a "female personality in a male body" and the "feeling of being a woman."  Benjamin borrowed Ulrichs' formula of "a female soul'... in [a] male body."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea is associated with, but separate from the brainsex theory of transsexualism, which is a belief about a neurodevelopmental [[cause of transsexualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey and Triea, 2007.  "The narrative has been extended to an etiological theory, which Lawrence (2007b) has called "the brainsex theory of transsexualism." The transsexual advocacy website, transsexual.org, puts this theory succinctly: 'A transsexual is a person in which the sex-related structures of the brain that define gender identity are exactly opposite the physical sex organs of the body.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the brainsex theory of transsexualism draw a distinction between "brain sex" and "anatomical sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harrybenjaminsyndrome-nz.co.nz/ |title=Harry Benjamin Syndrome (HBS) |accessdate=6 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202040714/http://www.harrybenjaminsyndrome-nz.co.nz/ |archivedate=2 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some proponents reject the term ''transsexual'', as the ''[[:wikt:trans-|trans-]]'' prefix implies that their true sex is changing, instead of being affirmed, with treatments like [[sex reassignment surgery]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A figurative interpretation, involving neurologically mediated [[gender identity]], was supported historically by pioneering sexologists such as [[Harry Benjamin]].&lt;ref name=HBS /&gt;

==Description==

The "feminine essence" idea predates modern psychological studies,&lt;ref name="How Sex Changed" /&gt; and was supported by some early sexologists such as [[Harry Benjamin]] ("the father of transsexualism"), who revived the idea of [[Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]] that a person might have a "female soul trapped in a male body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern researchers classify the common story told by transsexual women about themselves as a [[psychological narrative]], and therefore refer to this idea as the "feminine essence narrative".  In his book ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', sexologist [[J. Michael Bailey]] gives these statements as a prototypical example of the feminine essence narrative:  "Since I can remember, I have always felt as if I were a member of the other sex. I have felt like a freak with this body and detest my penis. I must get sex reassignment surgery (a "sex change operation") in order to match my external body with my internal mind."&lt;ref name =Dreger2008/&gt;

==Blanchard's deconstruction==

In 2008, [[Ray Blanchard]] presented the idea in the form of a theory in a commentary entitled "Deconstructing the Feminine Essence Narrative" in which he lists what he considers to be "the central tenets of the feminine essence theory", and then refutes each of these tenets:&lt;ref name = Blanchard2008/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

#Male-to-female transsexuals are, in some literal sense and not just in a figurative sense, women inside men’s bodies.
#There is only one type of woman, therefore there can be only one type of (true) male-to-female transsexual.
#Apparent differences among male-to-female transsexuals are relatively superficial and irrelevant to the basic unity of the transsexual syndrome.
#Male-to-female transsexuals have no unique, behavioral or psychological characteristics that are absent in typical men and women.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Neuroanatomic research==

According to Bailey and Triea,&lt;ref name=Bailey2007/&gt; one of the predictions based on the feminine essence theory is that male-to-female transsexuals would possess female rather than male brain anatomy. A widely cited research study of this topic examined the brain anatomy of six deceased male-to-female transsexuals, who had undergone during their lives hormonal treatment and surgical sex reassignment.&lt;ref name=Zhou1995&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhou J. N. |author2=Hofman M. A. |author3=Gooren L. J. G. |author4=Swaab D. F. | year = 1995 | title = A sex difference in the human brain and its relation to transsexuality | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 378 | issue = 6552| pages = 68–70 | doi = 10.1038/378068a0 | pmid = 7477289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study reported that a brain structure called the "central subdivision of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis" (BSTc), which is larger in typical males than in typical females, was in the female range in the transsexual subjects. The interpretation and the methods of that study have been criticized,&lt;ref name=LawrenceWeb&gt;[http://www.annelawrence.com/twr/brain-sex_critique.html Transsexual women’s resources, by Dr. Anne Lawrence]&lt;/ref&gt; and the finding continues to be a matter of debate.

Neurological research has found that the brains of transsexuals differ in a number of ways.  For example, a study done on the brains of non-homosexual transsexuals using MRI and pheromones as stimuli found that transsexuals process smelling androgen and estrogen in the same way that women do. Previous research by the same team found that homosexual males also process smelling the pheromones of the sexes in a way that is similar to that of women.&lt;ref name="pheroMTF"&gt;[http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bhm216v1?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;title=transsexual&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;andorexacttitleabs=and&amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT "Male-to-Female Transsexuals Show Sex-Atypical Hypothalamus Activation When Smelling Odorous Steroids"], by H. Berglund1,  P. Lindström2,  C. Dhejne-Helmy3 and  I. Savic2, Cerebral Cortex&lt;/ref&gt;   Work done by [[Simon LeVay]] had previously found that the hypothalamus of homosexual males has a region which is similar in size to that of heterosexual females.&lt;ref name="levay"&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/scotts/bulgarians/nature-nurture/levay.html A Difference in Hypothalmic Structure Between Heterosexual and Homosexual Men Simon LeVay]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not so in non-homosexual males.&lt;ref name="levay"/&gt; Last but not least a study done by Hilleke E Hulshoff Pol reached the conclusion that the brain does change in overall volume and the volume of its parts with the use of cross-sex hormone supplements.&lt;ref name="CSCB"&gt;[http://www.eje-online.org/cgi/content/abstract/155/suppl_1/S107 Changing your sex changes your brain: influences of testosterone and estrogen on adult human brain structure] Hilleke E Hulshoff Pol,  Peggy T Cohen-Kettenis1,  Neeltje E M Van Haren,  Jiska S Peper, Rachel G H Brans,  Wiepke Cahn,  Hugo G Schnack,  Louis J G Gooren2 and  René S Kahn&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of male-to-female transsexuals, the brain assumes the proportions of a female brain.&lt;ref name="CSCB"/&gt;

==Other findings==

The main support for the feminine essence narrative is that many male-to-female transsexuals say they feel it to be true; many autobiographical and clinical accounts by or about transsexual individuals contain variations of the statement of having a female soul or needing to make the external body resemble the inner or true self.&lt;ref name=Brown1996&gt;Brown, M. L., &amp; Rounsley, C. A. (1996). ''True selves: Understanding transsexualism.'' San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ettner1999&gt;Ettner, R. (1999). ''Gender loving care: A guide to counseling gender-variant clients.'' New York: W. W. Norton.{{ISBN|0393703045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of this narrative consider it to be inconsistent with their research findings.  Blanchard has reported finding that there are two, and not one, types of male-to-female transsexual and that they differ with regard to their sexual interests, whether they were overtly gender atypical in childhood, how easily they pass as female, the ages at which they decide to transition to female, birth order, and their physical height and weight.&lt;ref name=Blanchard1990&gt;Blanchard, R., &amp; Steiner, B. W. (1990). ''Clinical management of gender identity disorders in children and adults.'' Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Press. {{ISBN|0-88048-187-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2005a&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Smith Y. L. S.|author2= van Goozen S. H. M.|author3= Kuiper A.

==Role of medical community==

Since the medical community has guidelines for what types of individuals qualify for [[sex reassignment surgery]], transsexual persons sometimes adopt and tell the story that they believe will best help them qualify – the "feminine essence narrative" – and representing themselves as "essentially female", which may explain at least part of the prevalence of the feminine essence narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Terminology==

The phrase "feminine soul enclosed in a male body" (''anima muliebris in corpore virili inclusa'') was introduced in 1868 by [[Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]], not to describe male-to-female transsexuals, none of whom existed yet as such, but to describe a type of gay men who self-identified as feminine.&lt;ref name=Ulrichs1868&gt;Ulrichs, Karl-Heinrich (1868). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=k-2eOwAACAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Memnon+inauthor:Ulrichs&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&amp;cad=0_2 "Memnon.": Die Geschlechtsnatur des mannliebenden Urnings, eine naturwissenschaftliche Darstellung: körperlich-seelischer Hermaphroditismus.

'''Fertility in art''' refers to any [[artistic work]] representing or portraying [[fertility]], which usually refers to successful breeding among humans, although it may also mean successful [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]].  It includes engravings, drawings, [[paintings]], [[sculptures]], [[figurines]], [[portraits]] and even [[literary works]]. In [[Paleolithic art]], fertility is usually associated with figurines with exaggerated parts of human anatomy. 

Many civilisations in history believed in fertility [[deities]]. In [[Classical mythology]], [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (to the [[Greeks]]) or [[Terra (mythology)|Terra]] (to the [[Romans]]), the personification of [[Earth]], is associated with [[female fertility]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goddess-guide.com/greek-goddess-of-the-earth.html Greek Goddess of the Earth&lt;/ref&gt; Women are often depicted with a ripe [[bosom]], a child-bearing [[hip]] and a [[nude]] body in some cases.&lt;ref name=Fertility&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/mar/30/art.familyandrelationships Laura Cumming on fertility in art&lt;/ref&gt; Animals that [[reproduce]] prolifically are also seen in art depicting fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=9xkhBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT577&amp;lpg=PT577&amp;dq=Animals+that+%5B%5Breproduce%5D%5D+prolifically+are+also+seen+in+art+depicting+fertility.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=La01CAx3OF&amp;sig=bIowIpN3ZECwWjj3zvnf2akWJL4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxrIDa1c7TAhXFPBoKHYhTBboQ6AEIMjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Animals+that+%5B%5Breproduce%5D%5D+prolifically+are+also+seen+in+art+depicting+fertility.&amp;f=false|title=Animals into Art|first=Howard|last=Morphy|date=30 October 2014|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional cultures==
[[File:Wien NHM Venus von Willendorf.jpg|thumb|170px|left|[[Venus of Willendorf]], considered to be an example of fertility in art.]]
Fertility was present in art traditionally in many different forms. These include ceramic figures from some [[Pre-Columbian]] cultures, and a few figures from most of the ancient Mediterranean cultures. Many of these seem to be connected with fertility. Palielothic statuettes had round [[abdomen|bellies]], short [[heads]] and short, pointed [[legs]]. They also exaggerate the [[hips]], breasts, [[thighs]], or [[vulva]] of the subject.

Two of the earliest known possible depictions of fertility in art are the ''[[Venus of Willendorf]]'' (c. 25,000 [[BCE]]), an [[Oolite|oolitic]] [[limestone]] figurine of a woman whose breasts and hips have been exaggerated to emphasise her fertility found in [[Austria]] and the ''Fertility Goddess'' of Cernavoda (c. 5,000 BCE) found in [[Romania]], a small figurine that is meant to possibly show fertility. Historians consider these figurines to be goddesses. It is believed that worshippers would push the pointed legs into the earth to erect a temporary [[shrine]] for the goddess. The rotundity and [[obesity]] of these figurines were seen as attractive in early times when [[food]] was scarce.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 747&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western art==
===Early forms===
[[File:TITIAN - Venus Anadyomene (National Galleries of Scotland, c. 1520. Oil on canvas, 75.8 x 57.6 cm).jpg|thumb|220px|[[Titian]], copy of the ''[[Venus Anadyomene]]'' ]]
[[Fertility]] is often shown in artworks related to [[Classical mythology]]. Paintings of the [[Greek goddess]] of love [[Aphrodite (mythology)|Aphrodite]] ([[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] to the [[Romans]]) often portray her as [[Human sexual activity|sexual]] and fertile. [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' states that Aphrodire (Venus) was born from the sperm/foam of the castrated genitals of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]. ''[[Venus Anadyomene]]'' is a painting by [[Apelles]] that shows Aphrodite rising from the sea. The original painting is now lost, but a colossal copy of the painting exists, painted by the artist [[Titian]] and known as [[Venus Anadyomene (Titian)|''Venus Anadyomene'' by Titian]]. It depicts Venus (Aphrodite) rising from the sea and wringing her wet hair after her birth, a pose inspired by an account of the original painting by Apelles.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 140 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/8687/venus-rising-sea-venus-anadyomene-about-1520 Venus Rising from the Sea ('Venus Anadyomene') (About 1520)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demeter]], the Greek goddess of [[agriculture]], [[grain crops]], [[fertility]] and motherly relationships is often shown carrying a basket of [[apples]] in [[sculptures]], which are meant to show fertility.&lt;ref name=Fertility/&gt;
[[File:Ostara by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|170px|left|[[Johannes Gehrts]]: Eostre, the [[Germanic mythology|Germanic goddess]] flies through the heavens surrounded by Roman-inspired [[putti]], beams of light, rabbits and birds. Germanic people look up at the goddess from the realm below.]]

[[Hares]] are often portrayed in art as a symbol of [[reincarnation|rebirth]] and fertility.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1964)p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]] goddess [[Eostre]], whose [[theme (arts)|themes]] are fertility and rebirth, is often surrounded by hares in art. 
In Christianity, white rabbits are considered to be symbols of rebirth and fertility and are seen on a wing of the high altar in [[Freiburg Minster]], where they are playing at the feet of two pregnant women, [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Elizabeth_(biblical_figure)|Elizabeth]].
In [[Jan Van Eyck]]'s ''[[Arnolfini portrait]]'', a carving of [[Margaret the Virgin|St. Margaret of Antioch]] (patron saint of childbirth) appears in the center background of the painting. The presence of this symbol in the painting either promises fertility in the marriage or announces the pregnancy of the bride.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 749 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
[[Paula Modersohn-Becker]]'s series of self-portraits showing her pregnant even before she had actually been so represent her fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 64 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[The Jewish Bride]]'' is a painting of a couple joined in love. Despite the title, none of the subjects in the painting are [[Jewish]]. The Painting portrays the [[fertility]] of the young couple, particularly that of the woman.

The shoe tied to the happy couple's car can be seen to represent the fertile vagina, as with [[There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe|The Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe]], a nursery rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''The Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' (1973) Vol II p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Botticelli]]'s ''Primavera'', on one hand the [[Charites|Three Graces]] represented by nubile young women embody the sexual powers of springtime while opposite them [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]], the goddess of Spring is a symbol of motherhood and, by her distribution of the roses gathered in her skirt, believed to represent the good things of life.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Swinglehurts, ''Botticelli'' (1994) p. 26-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Picasso]]' paintings of [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]], everywhere there is green, the colour of fertility and nature's renewal.&lt;ref&gt;John Golding, in D. H Kahnweiler et al eds., ''Picasso 1881/1973'' (1973) p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; In his series of sleeping nudes, Picasso may have been influenced by the much reproduced [[Hal Saflieni Hypogeum|Hal Saflieni]] ''Reclining Woman'' and the Venuses of [[Venus of Lespugue|Lespugue]] and Willendorf, which with their heavy, ripe, bulging forms can be viewed as ancestresses of Picasso's images of female fecundity.&lt;ref&gt;Golding, p. 115-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
In ''[[The Bacchae]]'', an [[Classical Greece|ancient Greek]] [[tragedy]] written by [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] playwright [[Euripides]], Dionysus is mentioned as a male fertility god that represented a special kind of vitality that is sometimes referred to as the [[Energy (esotericism)|Life Force]]. It is described a force which, in itself, is neither good nor bad, but one that simply exists.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Curry trans., ''Euripides'' (Cambridge 1981) p. 164 and p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

When at the close of [[Possession (Byatt novel)|''Possession: A Romance'']], a novel by [[A. S. Byatt]], the two lovers Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte finally unite in the midst of a great storm. They wake the next day to find that the whole world had a strange new smell. It is described as 'a green smell, a smell of shredded leaves and oozing resin, of crushed wood and splashed sap, a tart smell, which bore some relation to the smell of bitten apples.' It was the described as the smell of death and destruction, however, it was said to smell fresh, lively and hopeful.&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Byatt, ''Possession: A Romance'' (1991) p. 507&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15073">In [[quantum mechanics]], the results of the quantum [[particle in a box]] can be used to look at the equilibrium situation for a quantum ideal '''gas in a box''' which is a box containing a large number of molecules which do not interact with each other except for instantaneous thermalizing collisions. This simple model can be used to describe the classical [[ideal gas]] as well as the various quantum ideal gases such as the ideal massive [[Fermi gas]], the ideal massive [[Bose gas]] as well as [[black body]] radiation ([[photon gas]]) which may be treated as a massless Bose gas, in which thermalization is usually assumed to be facilitated by the interaction of the [[Photon|photons]] with an equilibrated mass.

Using the results from either [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]], [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] or [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]], and considering the limit of a very large box, the '''Thomas-Fermi approximation''' (named after [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Llewellyn Thomas]]) is used to express the [[Degenerate energy levels|degeneracy of the energy states]] as a differential, and summations over states as integrals. This enables thermodynamic properties of the gas to be calculated with the use of the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] or the [[grand partition function]]. These results will be applied to both massive and massless particles. More complete calculations will be left to separate articles, but some simple examples will be given in this article.

==Thomas–Fermi approximation for the degeneracy of states==

For both massive and massless [[particles in a box]], the states of a particle are
enumerated by a set of quantum numbers
[''n&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;n&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;n&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'']. The magnitude of the momentum is given by

:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{h}{2L}\sqrt{n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2} \qquad \qquad n_x,n_y,n_z=1,2,3,\ldots &lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] and ''L'' is the length of a side of the box. Each possible state of a particle can be thought of as a point on a 3-dimensional grid of positive integers. The distance from the origin to any point will be

:&lt;math&gt;n=\sqrt{n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2}=\frac{2Lp}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose each set of quantum numbers specify ''f'' states where ''f'' is the number of internal degrees of freedom of the particle that can be altered by collision. For example, a spin ½ particle wou1ld have ''f''=''2'', one for each spin state. For large values of ''n'', the number of states with magnitude of momentum less than or equal to ''p'' from the above equation is approximately

:&lt;math&gt;
g=\left(\frac{f}{8}\right)  \frac{4}{3}\pi n^3 
 = \frac{4\pi f}{3} \left(\frac{Lp}{h}\right)^3
&lt;/math&gt;

which is just ''f'' times the volume of a sphere of radius ''n'' divided by eight since only the octant with positive ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is considered. Using a continuum approximation, the number of states with magnitude of momentum between ''p'' and ''p''+''dp'' is therefore

:&lt;math&gt;
dg=\frac{\pi}{2}~f n^2\,dn =  \frac{4\pi fV}{h^3}~ p^2\,dp
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V=L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the volume of the box. Notice that in using this continuum approximation, also known as '''Thomas−Fermi approximation''''', ''the ability to characterize the low-energy states is lost, including the ground state where ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''=1. For most cases this will not be a problem, but when considering [[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose–Einstein condensation]], in which a large portion of the gas is in or near the [[ground state]], the ability to deal with low energy states becomes important.

Without using any approximation, the number of particles with energy ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
  N_i = \frac{g_i}{\Phi(\epsilon_i)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt; g_i&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp;[[Degenerate energy level|degeneracy]] of state ''i''
|-
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|&lt;math&gt; \Phi(\epsilon_i) = 
\begin{cases} 
  e^{\beta(\epsilon_i-\mu)},  &amp; \text{for particles obeying Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics} \\
  e^{\beta(\epsilon_i-\mu)}-1, &amp; \text{for particles obeying Bose-Einstein statistics}\\ 
  e^{\beta(\epsilon_i-\mu)}+1, &amp; \text{for particles obeying Fermi-Dirac statistics}\\
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|with ''β'' = ''1/k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T&amp;nbsp;'', [[Boltzmann's constant]] ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, [[temperature]] ''T'', and [[chemical potential]] ''μ''.
|-
|(See [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]], [[Bose–Einstein statistics]], and [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]].)
|}
Using the Thomas−Fermi approximation, the number of particles ''dN&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp; with energy between ''E''&amp;nbsp; and ''E+dE''&amp;nbsp; is:

:&lt;math&gt;dN_E= \frac{dg_E}{\Phi(E)} &lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;dg_E&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; is the number of states with energy between ''E'' and ''E+dE''.

==Energy distribution==

Using the results derived from the previous sections of this article, some distributions for the gas in a box can now be determined. For a system of particles, the distribution &lt;math&gt;P_A&lt;/math&gt; for a variable &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is defined through the expression &lt;math&gt;P_AdA&lt;/math&gt; which is the fraction of particles that have values for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A+dA&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_A~dA = \frac{dN_A}{N} = \frac{dg_A}{N\Phi_A}&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;dN_A&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp;number of particles which have values for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A+dA&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dg_A&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp;number of states which have values for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A+dA&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp;probability that a state which has the value &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is occupied by a particle
: &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; total number of particles.

It follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_A P_A~dA = 1&lt;/math&gt;

For a momentum distribution &lt;math&gt;P_p&lt;/math&gt;, the fraction of particles with magnitude of momentum between &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p+dp&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;P_p~dp = \frac{Vf}{N}~\frac{4\pi}{h^3\Phi_p}~p^2dp&lt;/math&gt;

and for an energy distribution &lt;math&gt;P_E&lt;/math&gt;, the fraction of particles with energy between &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E+dE&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;
P_E~dE = P_p\frac{dp}{dE}~dE
&lt;/math&gt;

For a particle in a box (and for a free particle as well), the relationship between energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and momentum &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is different for massive and massless particles. For massive particles,

:&lt;math&gt; E=\frac{p^2}{2m}&lt;/math&gt;

while for massless particles,

:&lt;math&gt;E=pc\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the particle and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light.
Using these relationships,

*  For massive particles

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{2}
 dg_E &amp; = \quad \ \left(\frac{Vf}{\Lambda^3}\right)
\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}~\beta^{3/2}E^{1/2}~dE \\
 P_E~dE &amp; = \frac{1}{N}\left(\frac{Vf}{\Lambda^3}\right)
\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}~\frac{\beta^{3/2}E^{1/2}}{\Phi(E)}~dE \\
\end{alignat}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Λ'' is the [[thermal wavelength]] of the gas.

:&lt;math&gt;
\Lambda =\sqrt{\frac{h^2 \beta }{2\pi m}}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is an important quantity, since when ''Λ'' is on the order of the inter-particle distance &lt;math&gt;(V/N)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''1/3''&lt;/sup&gt;, quantum effects begin to dominate and the gas can no longer be considered to be a Maxwell–Boltzmann gas.

*  For massless particles

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{2}
 dg_E &amp; = \quad \ \left(\frac{Vf}{\Lambda^3}\right)
\frac{1}{2}~\beta^3E^2~dE \\
 P_E~dE &amp; = \frac{1}{N}\left(\frac{Vf}{\Lambda^3}\right)
\frac{1}{2}~\frac{\beta^3E^2}{\Phi(E)}~dE \\
\end{alignat}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Λ'' is now the thermal wavelength for massless particles.

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda = \frac{ch\beta}{2\,\pi^{1/3}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Specific examples==

The following sections give an example of results for some specific cases.

===Massive Maxwell–Boltzmann particles===

For this case:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(E)=e^{\beta(E-\mu)}&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating the energy distribution function and solving for ''N'' gives

:&lt;math&gt;N = \left(\frac{Vf}{\Lambda^3}\right)\,\,e^{\beta\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into the original energy distribution function gives

:&lt;math&gt;P_E~dE = 2 \sqrt{\frac{\beta^3 E}{\pi}}~e^{-\beta E}~dE&lt;/math&gt;

which are the same results obtained classically for the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. Further results can be found in the classical section of the article on the [[ideal gas]].

===Massive Bose–Einstein particles===
For this case:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(E)=\frac{e^{\beta E}}{z}-1\,&lt;/math&gt;

:where &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; z=e^{\beta\mu}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating the energy distribution function and solving for ''N'' gives the [[particle number]]

:&lt;math&gt;N = \left(\frac{Vf}{\Lambda^3}\right)\textrm{Li}_{3/2}(z)&lt;/math&gt;

where Li&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') is the [[polylogarithm]] function. The polylogarithm term must always be positive and real, which means its value will go from 0 to ζ(3/2) as ''z&amp;nbsp;'' goes from 0 to 1. As the temperature drops towards zero, ''Λ'' will become larger and larger, until finally ''Λ'' will reach a critical value ''Λ''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; where ''z=1'' and

:&lt;math&gt;N = \left(\frac{Vf}{\Lambda_{\rm c}^3}\right)\zeta(3/2),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\zeta(z)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Riemann zeta function]]. The temperature at which ''Λ=Λ''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the critical temperature. For temperatures below this critical temperature, the above equation for the particle number has no solution. The critical temperature is the temperature at which a Bose–Einstein condensate begins to form. The problem is, as mentioned above, that the ground state has been ignored in the continuum approximation. It turns out, however, that the above equation for particle number expresses the number of bosons in excited states rather well, and thus: 

:&lt;math&gt;
N=\frac{g_0
z}{1-z}+\left(\frac{Vf}{\Lambda^3}\right)\textrm{Li}_{3/2}(z)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the added term is the number of particles in the ground state. The ground state energy has been ignored. This equation will hold down to zero temperature. Further results can be found in the article on the ideal [[Bose gas]].

===Massless Bose–Einstein particles (e.g. black body radiation)===
For the case of massless particles, the massless energy distribution function must be used. It is convenient to convert this function to a frequency distribution function:

:&lt;math&gt;
P_\nu~d\nu = \frac{h^3}{N}\left(\frac{Vf}{\Lambda^3}\right)
\frac{1}{2}~\frac{\beta^3\nu^2}{e^{(h\nu-\mu)/k_{\rm B}T}-1}~d\nu
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Λ'' is the thermal wavelength for massless particles. The spectral energy density (energy per unit volume per unit frequency) is then

:&lt;math&gt;U_\nu~d\nu = \left(\frac{N\,h\nu}{V}\right) P_\nu~d\nu =  \frac{4\pi f h\nu^3 }{c^3}~\frac{1}{e^{(h\nu-\mu)/k_{\rm B}T}-1}~d\nu.&lt;/math&gt;

Other thermodynamic parameters may be derived analogously to the case for massive particles. For example, integrating the frequency distribution function and solving for ''N'' gives the number of particles:

:&lt;math&gt;N=\frac{16\,\pi V}{c^3h^3\beta^3}\,\mathrm{Li}_3\left(e^{\mu/k_{\rm B}T}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The most common massless Bose gas is a [[photon gas]] in a [[black body]]. Taking the "box" to be a black body cavity, the photons are continually being absorbed and re-emitted by the walls. When this is the case, the number of photons is not conserved. In the derivation of [[Bose–Einstein statistics]], when the restraint on the number of particles is removed, this is effectively the same as setting the chemical potential (''μ'') to zero. Furthermore, since photons have two spin states, the value of ''f'' is 2. The spectral energy density is then

:&lt;math&gt;U_\nu~d\nu = \frac{8\pi h\nu^3 }{c^3}~\frac{1}{e^{h\nu/k_{\rm B}T}-1}~d\nu &lt;/math&gt;

which is just the spectral energy density for [[Planck's law of black body radiation]]. Note that the [[Wien approximation|Wien distribution]] is recovered if this procedure is carried out for massless Maxwell–Boltzmann particles, which approximates a Planck's distribution for high temperatures or low densities.

In certain situations, the reactions involving photons will result in the conservation of the number of photons (e.g. [[light-emitting diode]]s, "white" cavities). In these cases, the photon distribution function will involve a non-zero chemical potential. (Hermann 2005)

Another massless Bose gas is given by the [[Debye model]] for [[heat capacity]]. This model considers a gas of [[phonons]] in a box and differs from the development for photons in that the speed of the phonons is less than light speed, and there is a maximum allowed wavelength for each axis of the box. This means that the integration over phase space cannot be carried out to infinity, and instead of results being expressed in polylogarithms, they are expressed in the related [[Debye function]]s.

===Massive Fermi–Dirac particles (e.g. electrons in a metal)===
For this case:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(E)=e^{\beta(E-\mu)}+1.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating the energy distribution function gives

:&lt;math&gt;N=\left(\frac{Vf}{\Lambda^3}\right)\left[-\textrm{Li}_{3/2}(-z)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where again, Li&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') is the polylogarithm function and ''Λ'' is the [[thermal de Broglie wavelength]]. Further results can be found in the article on the ideal [[Fermi gas]]. Applications of the Fermi gas are found in the [[free electron model]], the theory of [[white dwarf]] and [[degenerate matter]] in general.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4521">'''Johannes Gijsbrecht Kuenen''' (born 9 December 1940, [[Heemstede]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[microbiologist]] who is [[professor emeritus]] at the [[Delft University of Technology]] and a visiting scientist at the [[University of Southern California]]. His research is influenced by, and a contribution to, the scientific tradition of the Delft School of Microbiology.

Kuenen studied at the [[University of Groningen]], where he received both his [[Doctorandus]] degree and in 1972 his Doctorate (PhD) under the supervision of Professor Dr. Hans Veldkamp. The title of his thesis was ‘‘Colourless sulphur bacteria from Dutch tidal mudflats’’. After a short post-doc at the [[University of California in Los Angeles]] (USA), he returned as a senior lecturer to Groningen. In 1980, he moved to [[Delft]] to become the 4th Professor of Microbiology (succeeding M.W. Beijerinck and A.J. Kluyver) at Delft University of Technology. Kuenen's initial research interests were (the application of) bacteria involved in the natural [[sulfur cycle]] and [[yeast]] physiology and metabolism. His later interest in the (eco)physiology of nitrifying and [[denitrifying]] bacteria has led a.o. to the discovery of the bacteria within the phylum  [[planctomycetes]] that perform the [[Anammox]] process. In addition, his research has been focussed on (halo) alkaliphilic [[sulfur-oxidizing bacteria]] from soda lakes. Gijs Kuenen retired in 2005 but remains active in science.

== Awards ==
In 2004 Gijs Kuenen became a Knight in the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]], In 2005 he was elected  Fellow of the [[American Academy of Microbiology]]. In 2006 he received the Jim Tiedje Award for his outstanding contribution to microbial ecology at the 11th International Symposium on Microbial Ecology in Vienna and in 2007 he was awarded the Procter &amp; Gamble Award in Applied and Environmental Microbiology.

For his contribution to the founding of the education [[Life Science and Technology]] ([[Delft University of Technology]] and [[Leiden University]]) in 2005 he received an honorary membership of [[Study Association LIFE]].

==Named after Kuenen==
One of the five known anammox genera, with the single member [[Kuenenia stuttgartiensis]], has been named after Kuenen. The Kuenen lab had named the first discovered species [[Brocadia anammoxidans]], after the company Gist-Brocades (now [[DSM Gist]]), for which Kuenen did consulting work and in which wastewater the bacteria was discovered.

===Contraction and release===
The fundamental movement of Graham technique is the cycle between "contraction" and subsequent "release", which developed as a stylized representation of [[breathing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=LaMothe|first1=Kimerer L.|title=Nietzsche's Dancers: Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, and the Revaluation of Christian Values|date=2006|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781403977267|page=172|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gubFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the "fall and recovery" dualism of [[Doris Humphrey]]'s technique, it is one of the most important concepts in early modern dance.&lt;ref name="Foulkes"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julia L. Foulkes|title=Modern Bodies: Dance and American Modernism from Martha Graham to Alvin Ailey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zpia9O6Da_EC&amp;pg=PA17|date=1 November 2003|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-6202-5|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CraineMackrell2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Debra Craine|author2=Judith Mackrell|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=42g8Hp-xA48C&amp;pg=PA196|date=19 August 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-956344-6|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote box|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|width=20%|align=right|salign=right
|quote="Pull, pull on the contraction. Do not cave in. And the contraction is not a position. It is a movement into something. It is like a pebble thrown into the water, which makes rippling circles when it hits the water. The contraction moves."

}}

A classic Graham contraction is a movement originating from the deep [[pelvic floor|pelvic&amp;nbsp;muscles]]. These muscles, along with the [[Abdomen#Muscles|abdominal muscles]], pull the [[human vertebral column|spine]] into a [[:wikt:concave|concave]] arc from the [[coccyx]] to the [[nape]] of the neck, with the pelvis tucked and shoulders forward.&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;{{cite book | editor= Lisa Rado |last=Reynolds | first=Dee |chapter=Dancing Free: Women's Movements in Early Modern Dance | title=Modernism, Gender, and Culture: A Cultural Studies Approach | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-136-51553-8 | pages=263–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bannerman99" /&gt; The spine grows longer, not shorter, in a contraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macel |first1=Emily |title=Interview with Terese Capucilli |journal=Dance Magazine |date=July 2009 |url=http://www.dancemagazine.com/issues/july-2009/Terese-Capucilli |accessdate=12 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402193454/http://www.dancemagazine.com/issues/july-2009/Terese-Capucilli |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The force of the contraction can be used to move the body through space or change its trajectory.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; The release may be considered a relatively passive return to a "normal" state, or alternatively an equally active outward propulsion of energy.&lt;ref name =Bannerman99/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Terry | first=W. | title=I was there: selected dance reviews and articles--1936-1976 | publisher=Audience Arts | series=The Dance program | year=1978 | isbn=978-0-8247-6524-8 |pages=53–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contraction is associated with the exhale, and the release with the inhale, although this connection may be merely conceptual.&lt;ref name="Hart-Johnson" /&gt;

The [[Indexicality|indexical]] meaning of the contraction in Graham's choreography is generally that the dancer is overcome with emotion, although the details depend on the specific context.&lt;ref name =Bannerman99/&gt;

Graham's decision to make movement originate from the core rather than [[distal]]ly echoes the style of [[Isadora Duncan]], but Duncan wrote in [[My Life (Isadora Duncan autobiography)|her autobiography]] that movement originates in the [[solar plexus]] rather than the low abdomen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lang |first=Pearl |authorlink=Pearl Lang | editor=Horosko, M. | title=Martha Graham: The Evolution of Her Dance Theory and Training, 1926-1991 | publisher=Chicago Review Press | year=1991 | isbn=978-1-55652-142-3 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Spiraling===
The second fundamental concept in Graham technique is the [[spiral]]. The basic "spiraling" position consists of rotating the spine approximately 45° around its vertical axis, so that a dancer facing the front of the stage would have their shoulders aligned with the "Via Triumphalis", an imaginary line parallel to a corner-to-corner diagonal of the stage.&lt;ref name="Hart-Johnson" /&gt; In a "hip spiral", the movement initiates subtly from the [[hip]] and builds to maximum tension by pulling the opposing [[scapula|shoulder blade]] away from the initiating hip.&lt;ref name =Bannerman99/&gt;

===Falls===
{{quote box|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|width=20%|align=right|salign=right
|quote="Falling is not a literal representation of reality, but instead an embodiment of inner experience; not a reductive language, but a poetic language that derives its meaning from the layering of the physical and psychic."
|source=Former Graham dancer Ellen Graff, 2004&lt;ref name="Graff" /&gt;
}}
Like other early modern choreographers, Graham used [[floorwork]] to explore the themes of weight and gravity in new ways;&lt;ref name="Graff"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Graff | first=Ellen | title=When your heart falls: The drama of descent in Martha Graham's technique and theater | journal=Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory | volume=14 | issue=1 | year=2004 | pages=107–115 | url=http://marthagraham.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Falling-by-Ellen-Graff.pdf | doi=10.1080/07407700408571443}}&lt;/ref&gt; European students were "shocked" when [[Anna Sokolow]] introduced them to Graham's "percussive" falling techniques in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Partsch-Bergsohn"&gt;{{cite book | last=Partsch-Bergsohn | first=I. | title=Modern Dance in Germany and the United States: Crosscurrents and Influences | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | series=Choreography and Dance Studies Series | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-134-35821-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecn9AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR15 | page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Graham falls use contractions and manipulate the body's [[center of gravity]], in order to control the timing and direction of a fall.&lt;ref name="Graff"/&gt; There are a wide range of strictly codified Graham falls, including sitting and traveling falls; falls from elevation; and standing falls, which may be directed forward, backwards, to the side, or into a split.&lt;ref name="Graff"/&gt; In almost all falls, the dancer exerts a strong upward force to counteract the force of gravity and suspend the body in space for artistic effect.&lt;ref name="Graff"/&gt;

Graham falls can be used for dramatic effect, taking meaning in a choreographic context from manipulating the balance between actively suspending the body and surrendering to gravity.&lt;ref name="Graff" /&gt;

===Other aspects===
Graham technique uses the [[hand]]s in distinctive ways. They are generally meant to be active and purposeful, not decorative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daly|first1=Ann|title=Critical Gestures: Writings on Dance and Culture|date=2002|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=9780819565662|page=158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_g6IG0HIhoC&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=%22Graham%20technique%22%20hands&amp;pg=PA158}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often held in a stylized, cupped position, with the fingers held straight and pulled towards the palm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guest|first1=Ann Hutchinson|title=Your Move|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135800055|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f2ezz6bEvcAC&amp;pg=PA89}} (with illustration of Graham-contracted hand)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franklin|first1=Eric N.|title=Dynamic Alignment Through Imagery|date=2012|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=9780736067898|page=333|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CBwV_g8DhEMC&amp;lpg=PA333&amp;dq=%22Graham%20technique%22%20hands%20feet&amp;pg=PA333}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arm]]s typically move in response to impetus from the back or shoulders. Arm movements were often left unspecified in Graham's early work, and there is variation between Graham teachers' use of ''[[port de bras]]'' (carriage of the arms).&lt;ref name =Bannerman99/&gt;{{rp|12}}

==Analysis==

Graham technique is designed to make its dancers expressive and dramatic. Its movement vocabulary draws connections between the physical and emotional meanings of "power", "control", and "vulnerability".&lt;ref name="Hart-Johnson" /&gt; Movement initiates from the core, incorporating large back movements and [[floorwork|dancing on the floor]].&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gould |first1=Karen |editor1=Goethals, George R.|editor2=Sorensen, Georgia|editor3=Burns, James MacGregor|title=Encyclopedia of Leadership|volume=1|date=2004|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9780761925972|page=594|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kjLspnsZS4UC&amp;pg=PA594}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique highlights weight and effort; according to Marian Horosko, "the body had to appear to be pushing through a heavy mass, much like the pressure confronted when walking through water."&lt;ref name="Horosko"&gt;{{cite book | last=Horosko | first=M. | title=Martha Graham: The Evolution of Her Dance Theory and Training, 1926-1991 | publisher=Chicago Review Press | year=1991 | isbn=978-1-55652-142-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The technique's "earthbound" and "assertive" character initially drew strong criticism. In a "vehement" 1934 review, [[Lincoln Kirstein]] wrote: "Her jumps are jolts; her walks, limps and staggers; her runs, blind impulsive gallops; her bends, sways," and called the effect "stark, earth-ridden, gaunt, inward-eyed."&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kane"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kane |first= Angela |title= Episodes (1959): Entente Cordiale? |journal= Dance Research |volume=25 |issue=1 |issn= 1750-0095 |pages= 54–72 |doi=10.1353/dar.2007.0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Graham was strongly promoted by dance critic [[John Martin (dance critic)|John Martin]], who helped her to win a popular following.&lt;ref name="Conner"&gt;{{cite book | last=Conner | first=L. | title= Spreading the gospel of the modern dance: newspaper dance criticism in the United States, 1850-1934 |publisher= University of Pittsburgh Press | year=1997 |accessdate= 21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham was exceptionally flexible, and many of her technique's exaggerated movements can be difficult or painful to execute.&lt;ref name="Parviainen"&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Parviainen |first= Jaana |title=Bodies Moving and Moved |type= |page=99 |url=http://tampub.uta.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/68138/951-44-5595-9.pdf?sequence=1|year=1998 |publisher=[[Tampere University]] Press |access-date=12 Mar 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to ballet===

Graham is considered a "codified technique", like the several schools of classical [[ballet]].&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Helen|title=The Body, Dance and Cultural Theory|date=2003|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137487773|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jlkdBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Dyke|first1=Jan|title=Modern dance in a postmodern world|date=1992|publisher=National Dance Association|isbn=9780883145258|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are major differences between Graham and ballet techniques.

Graham dancers are trained to highlight their effort and use weight as a dramatic tool, while ballet dancers strive to appear weightless and effortless.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt; Graham technique's use of large torso movements and floorwork represent further breaks from the balletic tradition.&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt; Graham explained that, although she respected the advances made in the course of ballet history, "Ballet…did not say enough, especially when it came to intense drama, to passion."&lt;ref name ="Freedman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freedman|first1=Russell|title=Martha Graham: A Dancer's Life|date=1998|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780395746554|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LauOC7vYx-gC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;ots=e3LM_2BYW_&amp;dq=%22martha%20graham%22%20%22graham%20technique%22&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA56}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|56}} However, her extended collaboration with ballet-trained [[Erick Hawkins]] made her technique more balletic over time.&lt;ref name =Bannerman99/&gt;{{rp|23}}

===Gender===
The technique was originally developed on an all-female company, although the company later included men.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt; Graham sometimes criticized her dancers for failing to initiate from the pelvis, or as she sometimes put it, "move from the vagina";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scherr|first1=Apollinaire|title=DANCE; Making a Career With One Eye on a Gender Gap|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/04/arts/dance-making-a-career-with-one-eye-on-a-gender-gap.html|accessdate=13 March 2015|work=The New York Times|date=4 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; the connection between Graham technique and the female pelvis led one of Graham's male dancers to develop "vagina envy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bannerman|first1=Henrietta|title=Martha Graham's House of the Pelvic Truth: The Figuration of Sexual Identities and Female Empowerment|journal=Dance Research Journal|date=2010|volume=42|issue=1|pages=30–45|doi=10.1017/S0149767700000814|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8511717|accessdate=12 March 2015}} "The contraction as described above encloses the vagina and the womb.…a male dancer claimed to have "vagina envy"' no doubt because he was unable to obey that particular female-centered instruction.…Vagina envy may have represented the male dancer’s desire for the type of pelvic flexibility that lends itself best to Graham's style."&lt;/ref&gt; The pelvic origin of the contraction contributes to the role of [[sexuality]] in Graham technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bullough | first=V.L. | last2=Bullough | first2=B. | title=Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-135-82502-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-cqlAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA163 | page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminism|Feminist]] dance scholar [[Dee Reynolds (scholar)|Dee Reynolds]] has argued that, because Graham technique was "so large and forceful, thrusting into and conquering space," it allowed Graham and her early all-female company to "redefine femininity as powerful and autonomous."&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt; Reynolds also noted that the idea of "moving from the vagina" is similar to late nineteenth-century ideas about "[[female hysteria]]," a supposed sexual disorder sometimes linked to dancing, and Graham's contractions could be seen as reclaiming the female body as an artistic medium.&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt;

==Influence on modern dance==
Graham, along with [[Doris Humphrey]], [[Helen Tamiris]], [[Agnes de Mille]], and others, was part of an artistic movement in dance which rejected both the centuries-old tradition of classical [[ballet]] and the first-generation rebels of [[modern dance]], such as those who taught at the [[Denishawn school]] where Graham studied.&lt;ref name="Freedman" /&gt;{{rp|47}}

The expressive force of Graham technique had a revolutionary effect on modern dance.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt; Graham is now taught in most university dance programs, and remains the "hallmark" style of contemporary [[concert dance]]; its movement vocabulary is familiar to almost all professional contemporary dancers.&lt;ref name="TIME" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith-Autard" /&gt; It strongly influenced several other codified techniques, notably those of [[Merce Cunningham]], [[Lester Horton]], and [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]].&lt;ref name="McFee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McFee|first1=Graham|title=Understanding Dance|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134899463|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YzauVU0RRE4C&amp;lpg=PT201&amp;dq=evolution%20of%20cunningham%20technique%20owes%20a%20debt%20to%20graham%20technique&amp;pg=PT201#v=onepage&amp;q=evolution%20of%20cunningham%20technique%20owes%20a%20debt%20to%20graham%20technique}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perces"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perces|first1=Marjorie B.|last2=Forsythe|first2=Ana Marie|last3=Bell|first3=Cheryl|title=The Dance Technique of Lester Horton|date=1992|publisher=Princeton Book Company|isbn=9780871271648|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harss"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harss|first1=Marina|title=A Form of Order: On Paul Taylor|publisher=The Nation|date=12 September 2012|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/169891/form-order-paul-taylor|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
Graham developed a daily class for her company, which is still used (with some variations) to teach her technique.&lt;ref name ="Butterworth" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Butterworth|first1=Jo|title=Dance Studies: The Basics|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136584060|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gpfHBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17&amp;dq=%22graham+technique%22+%22modern+dance%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Traiger|first1=Lisa|title=Common Ground: 5 Modern Techniques for the 21st Century|journal=Dance Studio Life|date=6 March 2008|url=http://www.dancestudiolife.com/common-ground-5-modern-techniques-for-the-21st-century/|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The class is organized as follows:

*'''[[Floor work]]''' Students stand to salute the teacher as she or he enters, then work on the floor for thirty to forty minutes. Students begin with "bounces" of the torso in three seated positions, and perform contraction exercises and kneeling combinations. The floor exercises emphasize core strength and stability, explore the articulation of the spine and torso, and start to coordinate the arms, legs and head.&lt;ref name="BannermanSomatics"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bannerman | first=Henrietta | title=A question of somatics the search for a common framework for twenty-first-century contemporary dance pedagogy: Graham and Release-based techniques | journal=Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices | volume=2 | issue=1 | year=2010 | pages=5–19 | doi=10.1386/jdsp.2.1.5_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Standing exercises''' The floorwork exercises transition up to standing combinations, which work the legs, feet, and torso, and train balance and control.
*'''Across the floor''' These traveling combinations begin with simple walking exercises, and increase in complexity to include jumps and leaping turns. Students traditionally consider this section an opportunity for "real" dancing, in contrast to the other sections' duly executed technical training.
*'''Falls''' Each fall consists of a contraction and concurrent move from the feet or knees to the back. The falls are meant to demonstrate control of the body at each of the vertical levels previously practiced.&lt;ref name=Hart-Johnson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart-Johnson|first1=Diana|title=A Graham Technique Class|journal=Journal for the Anthropological Study of Human Movement|date=1997|volume=9|issue=4|pages=193–214|url=http://jashm.press.illinois.edu/9.4/9-4AGraham_Hart-Johnson193-214.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trademark dispute==
Martha Graham founded a school, the [[Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance]], which she sold in 1956. After Graham's death, [[Ron Protas]], her sole heir, sued the school for the rights to use Graham's trademarked name and choreography. A federal court awarded the school the rights to the names "Martha Graham" and "Graham technique" in 2001, and the rights to Graham's choreography in 2002.&lt;ref name=rights&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunning|first1=Jennifer|title=Martha Graham Center Wins Rights to the Dances|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/24/arts/martha-graham-center-wins-rights-to-the-dances.html|accessdate=13 March 2015|work=The New York Times|date=24 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunning|first1=Jennifer|title=Federal Judge Allows Martha Graham Center to Use Her Name and Methods|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/08/arts/dance/08GRAH.html|accessdate=13 March 2015|work=The New York TImes|date=8 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6054">The '''Hagedorn temperature''' is the temperature in [[theoretical physics]] where [[hadron]]ic matter (i.e. ordinary matter) is no longer stable, and must either "evaporate" or convert into [[quark matter]]; as such, it can be thought of as the "boiling point" of hadronic matter. The Hagedorn temperature exists because the amount of energy available is high enough that matter particle ([[quark]]-[[antiquark]]) pairs can be spontaneously pulled from vacuum. Thus, naively considered, a system at Hagedorn temperature can accommodate as much energy as one can put in, because the formed quarks provide new degrees of freedom, and thus the Hagedorn temperature would be an impassable [[absolute hot]]. However, if this phase is viewed as quarks instead, it becomes apparent that the matter has transformed into [[quark matter]], which can be further heated.

It is about the same as the mass-energy of the lightest hadrons, the [[pion]], at 130-140 MeV per particle or about 2 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; K.&lt;ref name="iop"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cartlidge |first=Edwin |title=Quarks break free at two trillion degrees |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2011/jun/23/quarks-break-free-at-two-trillion-degrees |work=[[Physics World]] |accessdate=27 January 2014 |date=23 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This energy range can be routinely probed in particle accelerators such as [[CERN]]'s [[Large Hadron Collider]]. Matter at Hagedorn temperature or above will spew out fireballs of new particles, which can again produce new fireballs, and the ejected particles can then be detected by particle detectors. This [[QCD matter|quark matter]] has been detected in heavy-ion collisions at [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]] and [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] in [[CERN]] (France and Switzerland) and at [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider|RHIC]] in [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (USA).

In string theory, a separate Hagedorn temperature can be defined for strings rather than hadrons. This temperature is extremely high (10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; K) and thus of mainly theoretical interest.&lt;ref name="NPB"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Atick |first=Joseph J. |last2=Witten |first2=Edward |year=1988 |title=The Hagedorn transition and the number of degrees of freedom of string theory |journal=[[Nuclear Physics B]] |volume=310 |issue=2 |pages=291 |bibcode=1988NuPhB.310..291A |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(88)90151-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Hagedorn temperature was discovered by German physicist [[Rolf Hagedorn]] in the 1960s while working at CERN. His work on the [[statistical bootstrap model]] of hadron production showed that because increases in energy in a system will cause new particles to be produced, an increase of collision energy will increase the entropy of the system rather than the temperature, and "the temperature becomes stuck at a limiting value".&lt;ref name="tale" /&gt;

== Technical explanation ==
Hagedorn temperature is the temperature above which the [[partition sum]] diverges in a system with exponential growth in the density of states.&lt;ref name="tale"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ericson |first=Torleif |last2=Rafelski |first2=Johann |date=4 September 2003 |title=The tale of the Hagedorn temperature |url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/28919 |work=[[CERN Courier]] |accessdate=2016-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyson |first=Peter |date=December 2007 |title=Absolute Hot: Is There an Opposite to Absolute Zero? |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/zero/hot.html |work=[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]] |accessdate=2008-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{T\rightarrow T_H^-} Tr[e^{-\beta H}]=\infty&lt;/math&gt;

Because of the divergence, people may come to the incorrect conclusion that it is impossible to have temperatures above the Hagedorn temperature, which would make it the [[absolute hot]] temperature, because it would require an infinite amount of [[energy]]. In equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{T\rightarrow T_H^-}E=\lim_{T\rightarrow T_H^-}\frac{Tr[H e^{-\beta H}]}{Tr[e^{-\beta H}]}=\infty&lt;/math&gt;

This line of reasoning was well known to be false even to Hagedorn. The partition function for creation of hydrogen-antihydrogen pairs diverges even more rapidly, because it gets a finite contribution from energy levels that accumulate at the ionization energy. The states that cause the divergence are spatially big, since the electrons are very far from the protons. The divergence indicates that at a low temperature hydrogen-antihydrogen will not be produced, rather proton/antiproton and electron/antielectron. The Hagedorn temperature is only a maximum temperature in the physically unrealistic case of exponentially many species with energy E and finite size.

The concept of exponential growth in the number of states was originally proposed in the context of [[condensed matter physics]]. It was incorporated into high-energy physics in the early 1970s by [[Steven Frautschi]] and Hagedorn. In hadronic physics, the Hagedorn temperature is the deconfinement temperature.

== In string theory ==
In [[string theory]], it indicates a phase transition: the transition at which very long strings are copiously produced. It is controlled by the size of the string tension, which is smaller than the [[Planck energy|Planck scale]] by the some power of the coupling constant. By adjusting the tension to be small compared to the Planck scale, the Hagedorn transition can be much less than the [[Planck temperature]]. Traditional [[Grand Unified Theory|grand-unified]] string models place this in the magnitude of 10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; [[kelvin]], two orders of magnitude smaller than the Planck temperature. Such temperatures have not been reached in any experiment and are beyond the reach of current, or even foreseeable technology.

'''The hole drilling method''' is a method for measuring residual stresses&lt;ref name="residual stress"&gt;[http://ttp.zcu.cz/en/laboratories/residual-stresses/residual-stresses Residual stresses, University of West Bohemia, New Technologies - Research Centre, department Thermomechanics of Technological Processes]&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref name="Hole drilling residual stress measurement"&gt;[http://www.g2mtlabs.com/residual-stress-measurement-rosette-hole-drilling-astm-837/ Residual stress measurement system]&lt;/ref&gt; in a material. [[Residual stress]] occurs in a material in the absence of external loads. Residual stress interacts with the applied loading on the material to affect the overall strength, fatigue, and corrosion performance of the material. Residual stresses are measured through experiments. The hole drilling method is one of the most used methods for residual stress measurement.&lt;ref name="hole drilling method"&gt;[http://ttp.zcu.cz/en/laboratories/residual-stresses/hole-drilling-method Measuring residual stresses by the hole drilling method, University of West Bohemia, New Technologies - Research Centre, department Thermomechanics of Technological Processes]&lt;/ref&gt;

The hole drilling method can measure macroscopic residual stresses near the material surface. The principle is based on drilling of a small hole into the material. When the material containing residual stress is removed the remaining material reaches a new equilibrium state. The new equilibrium state has associated deformations around the drilled hole. The deformations are related to the residual stress in the volume of material that was removed through drilling. The deformations around the hole are measured during the experiment using strain gauges or optical methods. The original residual stress in the material is calculated from the measured deformations. The hole drilling method is popular for its simplicity and it is suitable for a wide range of applications and materials.

Key advantages of the hole drilling method include rapid preparation, versatility of the technique for different materials, and reliability. Conversely, the hole drilling method is limited in depth of analysis, specimen geometry, and at least semi-destructive. 

[[File:Fig 03 EN wiki hole drilling method.jpg|thumb|Hole drilling method for measuring residual stresses – detail of the end mill in the measuring device.]]

== History and development ==

The idea of measuring the residual stress by drilling a hole and registering the change of the hole diameter was first proposed by Mathar in 1934. In 1966 Rendler and Vignis introduced a systematic and repeatable procedure of hole drilling to measure the residual stress. In the following period the method was further developed in terms of drilling techniques, measuring the relieved deformations, and the residual stress evaluation itself. A very important milestone is the use of finite element method to compute the calibration coefficients and to evaluate the residual stresses from the measured relieved deformations (Schajer, 1981). That allowed especially the evaluation of residual stresses which are not constant along the depth. It also brought further possibilities of using the method, e.g., for inhomogeneous materials, coatings, etc. The measurement and evaluation procedure is standardised by the norm ASTM E837&lt;ref name="ASTM E837"&gt;[ASTM E 837: Standard Test Method for Determining Residual Stress by the Hole Drilling Strain-Gauge Method, ASTM Standard, American Society for Testing and Materials]&lt;/ref&gt; of the American Society for Testing and Materials which also contributed to the popularity of the method. The hole drilling is currently one of the most widespread methods of measuring the residual stress. Modern computational methods are used for the evaluation. The method is being developed especially in terms of drilling techniques and the possibilities of measuring the deformations.

== Fundamental principles ==

The hole drilling method of measuring the residual stresses is based on drilling a small hole in the material surface. This relieves the residual stresses and the associated deformations around the hole. The relieved deformations are measured in at least three independent directions around the hole. The original residual stress in the material is then evaluated based on the measured deformations and using the so-called calibration coefficients. The hole is made by a cylindrical end mill or by alternative techniques. Deformations are most often measured using strain gauges (strain gauge rosettes).

[[File:Fig 04 EN wiki hole drilling method.png|thumb|Principle of the hole drilling method for residual stress measurement.]]

The biaxial stress in the surface plane can be measured. The method is often referred to as semi-destructive thanks to the small material damage. The method is relatively simple, fast, the measuring device is usually portable. Disadvantages include the destructive character of the technique, limited resolution, and a lower accuracy of the evaluation in the case of nonuniform stresses or inhomogeneous material properties.

The so-called calibration coefficients play an important role in the residual stress evaluation. They are used to convert the relieved deformations to the original residual stress in the material. The coefficients can be theoretically derived for a through hole and a homogeneous stress. Then they depend only on the material properties, hole radius, and the distance from the hole. In the vast majority of practical applications, however, the preconditions for using the theoretically derived coefficients are not met, e.g., the integral deformation over the tensometer area is not included, the hole is blind instead of through, etc. Therefore, coefficients taking into account the practical aspects of measuring are used. They are mostly determined by a numerical computation using the finite element method. They express the relation between the relieved deformations and the residual stresses, taking into account the hole size, hole depth, shape of the tensometric rosette, material, and other parameters.

The evaluation of the residual stresses depends on the method used to calculate them from the measured relieved deformations. All the evaluation methods are built on the basic principles. They differ in the preconditions for use, the accuracy requirements on the calibration coefficients, or the possibility to take additional influences into account. In general, the hole is made in successive steps and the relieved deformations are measured after each step.

== Evaluation methods for the residual stress ==

Several methods have been developed for the evaluation of residual stresses from the relieved deformations. The fundamental method is the ''equivalent uniform stress method''. The coefficients for particular hole diameter, rosette type, and hole depth are published in the norm ASTM E837.&lt;ref name="ASTM E837" /&gt; The method is suitable for a constant or little changing stress along the depth. It can be used as a guideline for non-constant stresses, however, the method may give highly distorted results.

The most general method is the ''integral method''. It calculates the influence of the relieved stress in the given depth which, however, changes with the total depth of the hole. The calibration coefficients are expressed as matrices. The evaluation leads to a system of equations whose solution is a vector of residual stresses in particular depths. A numerical simulation is required to get the calibration coefficients. The integral method and its coefficients are defined in the norm ASTM E837.&lt;ref name="ASTM E837" /&gt;

[[File:Fig 07 EN wiki hole drilling method.png|thumb|Residual stress evaluation scheme by the Integral method. Shape of the calibration coefficients depending on the hole depth and the position in the hole.]]

There are other evaluation methods that have lower demands on the calibration coefficients and on the evaluation process itself. These include ''the average stress method'' and ''the incremental strain method''. Both the methods are based on the assumption that the change in deformation is caused solely by the relieved stress on the drilled increment. They are suitable only if there are small changes in the stress profiles. Both the methods give numerically correct results for uniform stresses.

''The power series method'' and ''the spline method'' are other modifications of the integral method. They both take into account both the distance of the stress effect from the surface and the total hole depth. Contrary to the integral method, the resulting stress values are approximated by a polynomial or a spline. The power series method is very stable but it cannot capture rapidly changing stress values. The spline method is more stable and less susceptible to errors than the integral method. It can capture the actual stress values better than the power series method. The main disadvantage are the complicated mathematical calculations needed to solve a system of nonlinear equations.

== Using the hole drilling method ==

The [http://www.g2mtlabs.com/residual-stress-measurement-rosette-hole-drilling-astm-837/ hole drilling method] finds its use in many industrial areas dealing with material production and processing. The most important technologies include heat treatment, mechanical and thermal surface finishing, machining, welding, coating, or manufacturing composites. Despite its relative universality, the method requires these fundamental preconditions to be met: the possibility to drill the material, the possibility to apply the tensometric rosettes (or other means of measuring the deformations), and the knowledge of the material properties. Additional conditions can affect the accuracy and repeatability of the measuring. These include especially the size and shape of the sample, distance of the measured area from the edges, homogeneity of the material, presence of residual stress gradients, etc.  Hole drilling can be performed in the laboratory or as a field measurement, making it ideal for measuring actual stresses in large components that cannot be moved.

[[File:Sampling "Ginger Jake"(FDA 186) (8225510422).jpg|thumb|Sampling "Ginger Jake", &lt;!-- ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ???? --&gt; April 2, 1932]]
'''Jamaica ginger''' extract, known in the [[United States]] by the slang name '''"Jake,"''' was a late 19th-century [[patent medicine]] that provided a convenient way to bypass [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] laws, since it contained between 70% and 80% [[ethanol]] by weight.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==History==
The [[U.S. Treasury Department]], which administered the Prohibition laws, recognized Jake's potential as an illicit alcohol source, and because of this, it required changes in the solids content of Jake to discourage drinking. The minimum requirement of [[ginger]] solids per cubic centimeter of alcohol resulted in a fluid that was extremely bitter and difficult to drink.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Occasionally, [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] inspectors would test shipments of Jake by boiling the solution and weighing the remaining solid residue. In an effort to trick regulators, [[Rum-running|bootlegger]]s replaced the ginger solids{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} with a small amount of ginger and either [[castor oil]] or [[molasses]].

A pair of amateur chemists and bootleggers, Harry Gross and Max Reisman,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} worked to develop an alternative adulterant that would pass the tests, but still be somewhat palatable. They sought advice from a professor{{whom|date=October 2018}} at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] who did not realize it was meant for internal consumption. They settled on a [[plasticizer]], [[tricresyl phosphate|tri-o-tolyl phosphate]] (also known as tri-ortho cresyl phosphate, TOCP, or [[tricresyl phosphate]]), that was able to pass the Treasury Department's tests but preserved Jake's drinkability. TOCP was originally thought to be non-toxic; however, it was later determined to be a neurotoxin that causes axonal damage to the nerve cells in the [[nervous system]] of human beings, especially those located in the [[spinal cord]]. The resulting type of paralysis is now referred to as [[organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy]], or OPIDN.

In 1930, large numbers of Jake users began to lose the use of their hands and feet.&lt;ref&gt;https://newsok.com/article/3849680/jake-leg-epidemic-first-reported-by-oklahoma-city-doctors&lt;/ref&gt; Some victims could walk, but they had no control over the muscles which would normally have enabled them to point their toes upward. Therefore, they would raise their feet high with the toes flopping downward, which would touch the pavement first followed by their heels. The toe first, heel second pattern made a distinctive "tap-click, tap-click" sound as they walked. This very peculiar gait became known as the '''jake walk''' and those afflicted were said{{by whom|date=October 2018}} to have '''jake leg,''' '''jake foot,''' or '''jake paralysis.''' Additionally, the calves of the legs would soften and hang down and the muscles between the thumbs and fingers would atrophy.

Within a few months, the TOCP-adulterated Jake was identified as the cause of the paralysis,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} and the contaminated Jake was recovered. But by that time, it was too late for many victims. Some did recover full, or partial, use of their limbs. But for most, the loss was permanent. The total number of victims was never accurately determined, but is frequently quoted as between 30,000 and 50,000. Many victims were [[immigration|immigrants]] to the United States, and most were poor, with little political or social influence. The victims received very little assistance.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Several [[blues]] songs on the subject were recorded in the early 1930s, such as "Jake Walk Papa" by [[Asa Martin]], "Jake Leg Blues" by  the [[Mississippi Sheiks]], "Alcohol and Jake Blues" by [[Tommy Johnson (blues musician)|Tommy Johnson]], "Jake Jigga Juke" by [[Iron Mike Norton]], and "Jake Liquor Blues" by [[Ishman Bracey]].

Although this incident became well known,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} later cases of organophosphate poisoning occurred in Germany, Spain, Italy, and, on a large scale, in Morocco in 1959, where cooking oil adulterated with jet engine lubricant from an American airbase led to paralysis in approximately 10,000 victims, and caused an international incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Books ===
* In Sara Gruen's 2006 novel ''[[Water for Elephants]]'' jake paralysis afflicts one character, Camel, after drinking contaminated Jamaica Ginger.
* In the novel ''[[The Black Dahlia (novel)|The Black Dahlia]]'', the protagonist reveals early on that his mother went blind and fell to her death after drinking jake, leading to his resentment of his father for purchasing it.
*  In the novel ''Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet'' the main character purchases Jamaica Ginger in order to gain access to a jazz club when he was a minor.
*  In Cormac McCarthy's 1979 novel Suttree, minor character Kenneth "Worm" Hazelwood turns down a drink of homemade whiskey, saying that the last time he drank such liquor, it gave him "the jakeleg."
*  In his autobiography ''[[On the Move: A Life]],'' [[Oliver Sacks]] describes research that he conducted to develop an animal model of jake paralysis.  He was able to duplicate the toxic effects of TOCP on myelinated neurons in earthworms and chickens.
*  In Jamie Ford's novel ''[[Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet]]'' the two young characters Henry and Keiko are given a prescription for Jamaican Ginger in the 1942 portion of the story. They go to the pharmacy, pick up the bottles, and return to the Black Elks club. Due to war rationing and systemic oppression at the time, the black jazz club is not allowed to have a liquor license, so the proprietor uses Jamaican Ginger to make bathtub gin.

=== Music ===
Songs were recorded at the time about "jake" and its effects; in a variety of musical styles, including [[blue music|blues]] and [[country music|country]]. Several have been included on the compilation albums ''Jake Walk Blues'' (1977, 14 songs)&lt;ref&gt;{{discogs release |release=2099447 |name=Various{{snd}}Jake Walk Blues, Stash Records ST 110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Jake Leg Blues'' (1994, 16 songs)&lt;ref&gt;{{discogs release |release=5374288 |name= Various{{snd}}Jake Leg Blues, Jass Records J-CD-642 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Allmusic |class=album |id=jake-leg-blues-mw0000171317 |label=Various Artists: Jake Leg Blues |accessdate=July 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a marked but unsurprising duplication of songs between those albums.

'''Johannes du Plessis Scholtz''' (14 May 1900 &amp;ndash; 26 January 1990) was a [[South African]] [[philology|philologist]], [[history of art|art historian]], and art collector.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:PROF.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A picture of Prof. J. du P. Scholtz in his chair.|Prof. J. du P. Scholtz. {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;

==Scholarly life==
Scholtz studied first at the [[University of Stellenbosch]], completing an M.A. in 1920. He then took a job assisting the philologist {{Interlanguage link multi|Johannes Jacobus Smith (philologist)|af|3=Johannes J. Smith|lt=J. J. Smith}} in editing ''[[Huisgenoot|Die Huisgenoot]]'', but he moved shortly thereafter over to the [[Naspers|Nasionale Pers]] to be head of the publication department. In 1924 he went to [[Amsterdam]] and in 1927 he received a Ph.D. from the [[Gemeentelijke Universiteit]]. He returned to the Netherlands for two years (1929–1931) to pursue further studies in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]  [[dialectology]] and [[structural linguistics]], studies which formed the foundation of his later work in [[Afrikaans]].

Upon returning to Stellenbosch, he worked again for J. J. Smith on the [[Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal]]. He also worked under [[C. G. N. de Vooys]] at the [[University of Utrecht]] on his dissertation ''Die Afrikaner en Sy Taal, 1806-1875'', for which he received the [[Hertzog Prize]] for scholarly prose (what is more, the award had existed until then; it was expressly created in order to honor him with it). In 1934 he accepted a lecturership at the [[University of Cape Town]] teaching [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans]]. In 1950 he became head of the Department of Dutch and Afrikaans and Hofmeyr-Professor, and in 1965 retired as emeritus professor to pursue linguistic and artistic scholarship without the pressure of university administration. After his retirement he received [[honorary doctorate]]s from the University of Stellenbosch and the [[University of the Orange Free State]]. His final commemoration came in the form of a ''[[Festschrift]]'' entitled ''Dietse Studies'', given on the occasion of his 65th birthday with contributions from the foremost South African scholars of the time, as well as notable Dutch scholars such as [[C. B. van Haeringen]].

While others in South Africa, and to a lesser extent the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], were still discussing  origin of Afrikaans at a theoretical level only, Scholtz had been collecting and analyzing as much data as were available. He steered clear of theorizing, and his work was based on two great linguistic schools of the time: [[Leonard Bloomfield]]'s [[descriptive linguistics]], and [[N. S. Trubetzkoy]]'s [[structural linguistics]]. Scholtz was the first in South Africa to employ these approaches and in so doing revolutionized the world of Afrikaans linguistics. His work remains to this day the high-water mark for the fields of Afrikaans philology and linguistics.

Scholtz sat on numerous committees such as the Taalkommissie of the [[South African Academy]], the [[Van Riebeeck Society]], the [[Historical Monuments Commission]], the Archive Commission, and was one of the founders of the [[Vereniging vir die Vrye Boek]]. He was a member of  the [[South African Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[Maatschappij der Nederlandsche Letterkunde]], the [[International Centre for Onomastics]], and the [[Linguistic Society of America]]. He was also a co-trustee of the [[Irma Stern Trust]].

The South African Academy of Arts and Sciences honored him with numerous awards: in 1970 with the first [[Langenhoven Prize]] for linguistics, and in 1974 with the first [[Stals Prize]] for art history. The [[Kaapse Drie-Eeuestigting]] added to this and celebrated his work on the Irma Stern Trust with an honorary award in 1972.

==Publications==
His first scholarly work was an M.A. thesis on the language of the fishermen of [[Lamberts Bay|Lambertsbaai]], written under the tutelage of J. J. Smith, (which has subsequently been lost). In 1934 his publishing life began with the article "Afrikaanse geskrifte van Louis Henri Meurant uit die jare 1844-1850" in ''Tydskrif vir Wetenskap en Kuns'', Jg. 12, Nr. 4, Julie 1934.

The most productive period for Scholtz, however, was after 1950, after his retirement from UCT in 1965. He now had  time for his art studies, and also to publish  analyses of the textual material that L.C. van Oordt had mined out of the Kaapse Argief. By this point in his intellectual life, Scholtz was in a perfect position to evaluate these texts.

Scholtz's monographs on [[Strat Caldecott]], [[Pieter Wenning]], [[D. C. Boonzaier]], [[Moses Kottler]], and [[Katrine Harries]] remain authoritative. Not only are they the best works on their subjects, but "Strat Caldecott, 1886-1929" has become a prized possession for collectors of Africana.

==Work in the arts==
He became interested in the fine arts at the height of classical [[modernism]]'s zenith. In 1923, while at the National Press, he met the "famous and feared"  D. C. Boonzaier, [[cartoonist]] and supporter of the fine arts in Cape Town. Through Boonzaier he became acquainted with art critic [[Bernard Lewis (critic)|Bernard Lewis]] and [[sculptor]]  Moses Kottler . Eventually, his circle of artist-friends was to include the [[Painting|painter]]s Enslin du Plessis, Jean Welz, Florence Zerffi  and  Irma Stern, the [[graphic artist]] Katrine Harries, and, less intimately, Hendrik Pierneef, Erich Mayer, and  Ruth Prowse, the members  of a school of South African Impressionism in the years 1915-1935. This was perhaps the most important epoch in South African art, and Scholtz was there for all of it. Scholtz's literary friends were famous in South Africa: M.E.R., N.P. van Wyk Louw, Dirk Opperman, and Boerneef.

'''''Law in Modern Society: Toward a Criticism of Social Theory''''' is a 1976 book by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. In the book, Unger uses the rise and decline of the [[rule of law]] as a vehicle to explore certain problems in [[social theory]]. According to Unger, problems that were central concerns of classical social theorists like [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]—the problems of explanation, order, and modernity—remain unsolved. Unger contends that the failure of classical social theory to solve these dilemmas can be traced to the way in which it asserted its independence from the ancient political philosophers, namely in its denial of a supra-historical human nature and in its insistence upon the contrast of [[fact-value distinction|fact and value]]. Unger argues that a radical reorientation of social theory is needed to solve the problems it faces. "To carry out its own program," Unger writes, social theory must destroy itself."{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=8}} The rise and decline of the rule of law, and the dilemmas of social theory, converge in the need to be able to compare and criticize different forms of society, in order to be able to more effectively submit the organization of society to the human will.

==Overview==

===Chapter 1: The Predicament of Social Theory===

Unger opens ''Law in Modern Society'' by connecting the study of law to the unsolved problems of social theory. Social theory is the tradition originating in the writings of [[Montesquieu]] and culminating with the work of [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]].{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=1-3}} In Unger's view, classic social theory as represented by these thinkers is marked by an insistence on the distinction between fact and value, description and evaluation, and also by a denial of a unitary human nature. Unger contrasts classic social theory with the political philosophy of the ancients, who did not recognize as sharp a distinction between fact and value, and maintained that there is a universal human nature that exists in all times and places.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=3-5}}

The study of law affords a vantage point from which to explore three unsolved problems of social theory, according to Unger. The first, the '''problem of method''', is that the prevailing methodological approaches to social study are inadequate. The rationalist approach (as seen in the works of economists) and the historicist approach (which accepts the function of cause and effect but not logical entailment) both invite deterministic social explanations. Unger contends that we need a third method, one that is generalizing, and yet also open to rich historical particularity while not falling into deterministic explanations.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=8-23}}

The second problem is the '''problem of social order'''. How do we account for the existence of a social order? Classical social theory is represented by a struggle between the doctrines of instrumentalism (or private interest) versus legitimacy (or consensus). The legitimacy approach sees rules as manifestations of the shared values of a group. The instrumentalist approach sees society as made up of many divergent individual wills, and rules serve the instrumental purpose of helping the members of society achieve their privately chosen aims in the long run.  Utilitarianism is an example of an instrumentalist approach. According to Unger, we need to go beyond the partial truths expressed in each doctrine.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=23-37}}

The third unsolved problem of social theory is '''the problem of modernity'''. What marks the experience of modernity? What is its place in world history? What is the relationship between ideology and actuality in modern life? Our social theory must be able to reconcile the subjective experience of society with its objective meaning. As history transpires, new puzzles are added to the experience of studying modernity.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=37-40}} A large part of the problem of modernity is the difficulty of comparing modern forms of social life: modern Western society with its forbears, and different forms of contemporary society (traditional, revolutionary socialist, postliberal) among themselves.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=41-42}}

The program of classic social theory has value, according to Unger—namely in allowing us to study human beings as they are rather than as they ought to be, and in helping us to inquire into how each society shapes conduct and consciousness of its members. These classical social theorists sought to create a body of objective knowledge of society that would not be at the mercy of metaphysical speculation or political controversy, and up to a point, they succeeded.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=266-267}} But Unger concludes that the problems of social theory cannot be resolved unless the truths of classic social theory are reconciled with the insights of older political philosophy.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=43}} We need a general doctrine of human nature.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=40-43}}

===Chapter 2: Law and the Forms of Society===

In this chapter Unger addresses the varieties of law and explores the conditions under which each of them develops. '''Customary/interactional''' law is neither public nor positive, and consists of implicit standards of conduct, not formulated rules. Under a system of customary and interactional law, customs are characteristically inarticulate.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=49-50}} '''Bureaucratic/regulatory''' law is public and positive, and emerges with the division of state and society.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=50-52}} A '''legal order''' is a legal system that is committed to being general and autonomous, in addition to being public and positive.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=52-54}}

From this discussion, he draws conclusions about the issue of social order as it relates to the development of law. Unger explains how disintegration of community is accompanied by a trend toward increasing specialization in a society's division of labor, a trend that is responsible for the separation of state and society.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=63}} This process erodes the basis for an inclusive set of shared beliefs.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=61-62}} The legal order emerges with interest group pluralism,{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=66-76}} as well as reliance on higher divine or universal law as standard for justifying and criticizing a state's positive law.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=76-86}}  The rule of law is a response to the decline of order in society.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=127-133}} But when the belief in higher law declines, the legal order is threatened. In contemporary history, the natural rights synthesis that underlies the legal order ideal has been undone, with the result that the coherence of the rule of law ideal is compromised.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=84-86}}

===Chapter 3: Law and Modernity===

In this chapter, Unger traces the rise and decline of the rule of law in society. He begins by setting out a preliminary framework for the comparison of societies, and uses this framework to examine tribal society, liberal society, and aristocratic society. Unger's inquiry into these types of society revolves around three questions: What is the nature of the contrast between insiders and outsiders? How are insiders drawn together in significant groups and what is the quality of their encounters with strangers? And, finally, how individuals conceive of the place of the ideal—do they have a concept of the right or the good that transcends the natural or social world?{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=137-140}}

Unger concludes that tribal society displays the starkest possible contrast between insiders and outsiders; outsiders are not regarded as human beings with whom the insiders share anything significant in common. There is a paucity of significant groups in tribal society. And there is little conception of a good or right that towers over the immanent reality of daily life or the natural world. The important insight, for Unger, is that tribal society is an extremely cohesive social world, where there is deep agreement about fundamental social questions, profound distrust of strangers, and no recognition of overarching ideals against which the quotidian life or nature can be compared.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=140-143}}

At the other extreme, liberal society is one in which the contrast between insiders and outsiders is softened by the fact that each individual belongs to a large number of significant groups. Because members of liberal society become accustomed to other people being both insiders and outsiders in different contexts, the hostility of tribal society for the stranger is replaced, in liberal society, by ideals of impersonal respect and formal equality. People will abide by relatively stable standards of social order because it is to their advantage to do so, not because they observe identical conceptions of the true and the good. In liberal society, a concept of the right and the good transcends the reality of daily life and the natural world.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=143-147}}

Unger views aristocratic society as a synthesis of tribal and liberal societies. Aristocratic society unites universalism and particularism. In aristocratic society, significant social groups are experienced as steps on a hierarchic ladder. Each individual belongs to a specific group, his estate, which confers on him a range of entitlements and obligations and predetermine his outlook on the world. These strata are sharply divided from each other and are decisive in determining the quality of the individual's life. Aristocratic society's view of the relationship between the ideal and the actual occupies an intermediate position between the views of tribal and liberal society. In aristocratic society, there is an intense oscillation between a tendency to sanctify existing social arrangements and the tendency to oppose them to a higher heavenly perfection.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=147-153}}

Having set out a rudimentary grammar for the comparison of societies, Unger traces the emergence and decline of the liberal state and the rule of law{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=134}} (which Unger describes as the soul of liberal society{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=192}}).

Liberal society developed out of aristocratic society, namely the society of estates (Standestaat), which was an intermediary system between feudal society and the modern liberal state.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=155-156}} The law of the Standestaat was a forerunner to the modern legal system, and consisted of an area of royal discretion (matters falling under the prince's prerogative to keep the peace) and a higher law (matters pertaining to the privileges and obligations of estates of the realm).{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=158-160}} The elements that make up a modern legal order—positiveness, publicity, generality and autonomy—were not present,{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=160}} but as the formerly neat line between royal prerogatives and the law of estates faded away, the prince was increasingly held to standards of generality and autonomy, and estate privileges acquired a public and positive character.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=162-163}} The confinement of royal power by the fundamental law of the Standestaat was supported by a belief in a God-given natural order.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=166}}

The liberal state—with its multiplicity of significant groups, the disappearance of a sharp distinction between insiders and outsiders, and a stark division between the ideal and the actual—faced two questions with increasing urgency: how can there be consensus without widespread agreement about the good,{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=169-170}} and how can we distinguish legitimate from illegitimate uses of power in the face of dissolving hierarchy and moral confusion?{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=172-173}} The rule of law, which attempted to guarantee the impersonality of power, was a way of dealing with these urgent questions.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=176-178}}

The rule of law has two major premises—that the most significant forms of power can be concentrated in government, and that power can be effectively constrained by rules. But Unger contends that these premises are largely fictitious.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=178-179}} They are undermined by the awareness that individuals are most vulnerable to hierarchies of the family, the workplace, and the market that are largely beyond the reach of the legal system, and also that rules can never make power truly impersonal and impartial—administrators and judges will always decide among competing sets of beliefs in rendering a decision.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=179-181}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, the very assumptions of the rule of law ideal appear to be falsified by the reality of life in liberal society ... The state, a supposedly neutral overseer of social conflict, is forever caught up in the antagonism of private interests and made the tool of one faction or another. Thus, in seeking to discipline and to justify the exercise of power, men are condemned to pursue an objective they are forbidden to reach. And this repeated disappointment accentuates still further the gap between the vision of the ideal and the experience of actuality.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=181}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The contradictions and paradoxes of liberal society, by undermining the rule of law and the ideals it represents, ultimately give rise to what Unger calls postliberal society. Postliberal society is marked by overt intervention by the government in areas previously regarded as beyond the reach of state action, and a gradual approximation of state and society. The state's pretense of being a neutral guardian of the social order is abandoned.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=192-193}} These trends are reflected in the rise of open-ended clauses in legislation, administration, and adjudication, and a concern with substantive justice over formal justice.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=192-200}} The effacement of the boundary between state and society, called corporatism, leads to the rise of state institutions that rival the state in their power.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=200-203}} Unger argues that these welfare state institutions are an assault on the legal order, while the corporatist tendencies in postliberal society undermine bureaucratic law.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=200}} The danger of these tendencies, Unger contends, is demonstrated by the Weimar Republic, in which the decline of the rule of law in favor of a welfare corporate state set the stage for terror and inhumanity of Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=216-220}}

Unger concludes his examination of law and modernity by looking at two varieties of the modern state—the traditionalist state{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=224-231}} and the revolutionary socialist{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=231-234}}—then considering two possibilities for the development of law in the future. Seeing similar tensions within traditionalist and revolutionary socialist societies,{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=234-235}} Unger points out that the liberal state is only a special case of modernity.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=166}} He concludes that there's no more reason to think that societies will converge toward similarity rather than grow in their differences.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=237}}

The future of the rule of law, Unger suggests, could take two forms. The first, pessimistic, possibility he imagines is a scenario in which the progression of custom, bureaucracy, and rule of law revolves in a circle, and the postliberal decline of the rule of law would lead to the return of custom as the exclusive instrument of the social order.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=238-239}} There would be a relapse of a tribalism that sanctifies the existing order of the group as an irrevocable decree of nature. The second possibility Unger imagines is an optimistic scenario, which Unger describes as a spiral in which "individual freedom could be rescued from the demise of the rule of law."{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=239}} On this model, society defeats inequality to such an extent that people place greater confidence in collective choices, not suspecting them as a product of the interests of dominant groups.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=239-240}} The increasing equality of society would make possible a greater consensus about the immanent order of society and help refine further the meaning of equality.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=240}}

===Chapter 4: The Predicament of Social Theory Revisited===

In this final chapter, Unger returns to the questions of the methodology of social theory with which he opened the book.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=243-245}} For each of the unsolved problems of social theory—the problem of method, the problem of social order, and the problem of modernity—Unger concludes that the theoretical problems of social theory require a political solution.

For the problem of method, Unger offers the interpretive method as an alternative to the rationalist and historicist approaches favored by classical social theorists. The interpretive method, which emphasizes the embeddedness of action in belief and the way social phenomena cluster into meaningful totalities, avoids the tendency of rationalist and historicist methods to fall into deterministic accounts of human activity, while also offering the prospect of reconciling the demands of subjectivity and objectivity in social explanation. But the possibility of reconciling subjectivity and objectivity in social theory ultimately is premised on a belief in the unity of the human spirit, and in order to be achieved, we would need a community of experience, understanding and value to come into existence. For this reason, to solve the problem of method completely requires a political solution.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=245-262}}

For the second persistent problem of social theory, the problem of social order, Unger sees the crux of this problem in the divergence between the doctrines of legitimacy/consensus and instrumentalism/private interest. These views offer completely different accounts of the basis for order in society. Unger allows that instrumentalism is more effective in explaining liberal society, while consensus theory comes closer in explaining tribal and hierarchical societies.
Social study of law suggests a response to our puzzlement over the basis of order in society. It puts the controversy between the doctrines of private interest and consensus, and hence between the instrumental and noninstrumental view of rules, in perspective. But once again, a political solution is called for to deal with the divergence between instrumentalism and consensus theories: the crisis of order will only be fully resolved once it reconciles individual freedom with community cohesion, and the sense of immanent order with possibility of community cohesion.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=262-265}}

Addressing the final unsolved problem of social theory, the problem of modernity, Unger concludes that we must reject the approaches offered by both liberalism, which views society as an association of individuals with conflicting ends and whose security and freedom are guaranteed by the rule of law, and Marxism, which sees society as a structure of class domination whose true character is hidden by the prevailing ideology. Unger argues we must focus on the interplay between belief and experience, consciousness and organization, in the study of modernity. This interplay takes new forms as history unfolds. The political problem presented by modernity—a problem confronted by postliberal, traditionalist, and revolutionary socialist societies—is the problem of reconciling freedom and community. Harmonizing the sense of latent order in society with the capacity to let will remake social arrangements is the key to reconciling freedom and community.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=265-266}}

==Reception==

[[Talcott Parsons]] reviewed ''Law in Modern Society'' for the ''[[Law &amp; Society Review]]'', and offered qualified praise for Unger's work. "The book is important because it contains one of the sharpest and clearest statements of the problem of what the author calls the place of a legal system in a total and complex society."{{sfn|Parsons|1977|p=145}} However, Parsons contends that Unger erroneously claims that law as a social phenomenon is restricted to its interpenetration with the state. Parsons also "disagree[s] with [Unger's] characterization of the legal system as ''part of the structure of modern societies''."{{sfn|Parsons|1977|p=149}} Parsons concludes: "His is both an important and a good book, but it does not give the reader a
competent and comprehensive appraisal of the issues which contemporary legal and 'social' theory need to confront in their mutual pursuit of an understanding of legal systems."{{sfn|Parsons|1977|p=149}}

Manning J. Dauer reviewed ''Law in Modern Society'' in ''[[The Journal of Politics]]'', describing the book as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;an able work arguing for a new synthesis in social sciences and in legal theory. The argument that traditionalistic aspects now need modifying is well presented. The rule of law is an important concept, but it has to be adapted to more individualistic judgments as the social sciences impinge on traditionalistic interpretations. Might he consider John Rawls's attempt to define Social Justice? Unger points out the need and the difficulties; the method whereby this will be achieved is still in process, but the dilemma presented to the social sciences is well stated.{{sfn|Dauer|1977|p=1106}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

German sociologist Klaus Eder considered ''Law in Modern Society'' alongside [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Donald Black]]'s ''The Behavior of Law''. Eder considered Unger's argument in detail, and concluded that Unger offered a promising research program for a sociological study of law:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This model of the evolution of law is an interesting working hypothesis, which may be especially fruitful for the analysis of changes in modern law. [Unger's] book is ... neither more nor less than a research program, probably a fruitful one, for the sociological study of law on two levels: a synchronic structural description of forms of normative order and a diachronic social-historical analysis of the factors that produce structural transformations of law.{{sfn|Eder|1977|p=142-143}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[James B. Stewart|James Stewart]] reviewed ''Law in Modern Society'' for the ''[[Journal of Economic Issues]]'', writing that "this book should be read by those seeking to escape the limitations of existing social theory and particularly neoclassical economics. In particular, Unger's emphasis on the need to undertake cross-cultural analyses and his careful delineation of alternative concepts of law provide a useful guide for further developments in institutional economics."{{sfn|Stewart|1976|pp=990-991}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Neil T. Duxbury wrote a retrospective assessment of ''Law in Modern Society'' in ''[[The Modern Law Review]]''. Duxbury acknowledges Unger's commitment to "straddle the frontiers of social theory" in both ''[[Knowledge and Politics]]'' and ''Law in Modern Society'', calling this persistence in addressing the most difficult questions of social theory a "defining feature of the book." However, Duxbury finds fault with the book, contending that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unger's notion of post-liberalism is awash with over-generalised arguments. Contrary to his own suggestions, there appears to be no reason why the corporatist tendency within post-liberalism should result not only in a move towards the establishment of substantive justice, but also in the maintenance of the liberal tendency towards formal justice.{{sfn|Duxbury|1986|p=673}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Duxbury concludes that Unger's work operates at such a vague and abstract level of generality, that his work might be invalidated by empirical evidence left unexplored by Unger:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unger has continued to develop his 'modernist' position with a conceptual vagueness which suggests not so much that he should be criticised for theorising at a selected level of abstraction, but rather that, so long as he continues to operate at this level, he will always, if only potentially, be open to the charge of failing to pay sufficient attention to the empirical evidence on offer-evidence which may sometimes invalidate the conceptualisations to which he ascribes.{{sfn|Duxbury|1986|p=679}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alfred P. Rubin offered high praise for ''Law in Modern Society'' in ''Perspective'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is impossible to do justice to this book in a short review. The evolution of society from status to contract and back to status has been noted by many other writers, but Professor Unger's framework for social analysis is in large part original, accessible only to sophisticated scholars, and possibly seminal.{{sfn|Rubin|1976|p=114}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Mercury, Venus and the Moon Align.jpg|thumb|250px|Conjunction of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus (planet)|Venus]], appearing above the [[Moon]], at the [[Paranal Observatory]].]]

This is a list of our [[solar system]]'s recent and forthcoming '''planetary''' [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunctions]] (in layman's terms, "when two planets look close together").

In [[astronomy]], a conjunction is an event, defined only when using either an [[Equatorial coordinate system|equatorial]] or an [[Ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic]] [[celestial coordinate system]], in which '''any''' two [[astronomical objects]] (e.g. [[asteroid]]s, [[moon]]s, [[planet]]s, [[star]]s) have the same [[celestial longitude]], normally as when observed from the Earth ([[geocentric]]).

In the case of a geocentric conjunction of two of our solar system's planets, since our solar system's planets appear to travel "along the same line" (the [[ecliptic]]), the two planets appear to an Earthbound observer as being near one another in the sky around the time of the conjunction.

The list below presents instances during the period 2005-2020 in which two of our solar system's planets are in conjunction according to the equatorial coordinate system (in which the celestial longitude is termed [[right ascension]]).

[[File:US Army 52327 25th CAb touches down in Kuwait.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Small arms live-fire training, simulating advancing upon an enemy compound at [[Camp Buehring]], Kuwait, 2009.]]
A '''live-fire exercise''' or LFX is any [[military exercise]] in which a realistic scenario for the use of specific equipment is demonstrated. In the popular lexicon this is applied primarily to tests of weapons or weapon systems that are associated with the various branches of a nation's [[armed forces]], although the term can be applied to the civilian arena as well.

==Armed services==
Armed services usually use live-fire exercises as an opportunity to use real [[ammunition]] in a realistically created combat situation. The area in which these tests are conducted will be devoid of people to avoid casualties, and will likely be owned by the government which authorized the test. Most live-fire tests are conducted either against derelict equipment, such as tanks and ships, or against remotely controlled drones.

The purpose of this type of exercise is twofold: First, it offers recruits the chance to get accustomed to their weapons so that they will know how to properly operate them; secondly, this provides soldiers with an opportunity to fire live ammunition without having to worry about an actual enemy returning fire. This allows soldiers to get reacquainted with the feel and time of actually using and expending ammunition, rather than simply simulating the experience. Live-fire exercises of this type can be observed either by remotely controlled cameras or by long-range [[telescope|telescopic]] devices, such as [[binoculars]].

===Army===
[[File:Mercedes-Benz G-Class of the Canadian Land Forces.JPG|thumb|right|A Canadian Army Mercedes-Benz G-Class wagon in a live-fire exercise with Canadian soldier firing the mounted C6 GPMG.]]
An army, being the main branch responsible for land combat, is perhaps the best known group that conducts live-fire exercises. Most live-fire exercises occur within the [[military base]] where the units conducting the exercise are located. In some cases, one installation will host units from another for a larger live-fire exercise. Equipment tested under these circumstances range from [[small arms]] and [[assault rifle]] fire all the way up to missile systems and [[artillery]] fire. In the case of small arms, the tests are usually proficiency based and aimed at ensuring a soldier can fire their assigned weapons. In the case of the latter, missile systems may be test-fired at remotely controlled drones to simulate a situation in which enemy missiles or aircraft are launched at allied or friendly forces, while artillery units can take the opportunity to test new shells or to fire under adverse [[weather]] conditions for a chance to see how the artillery pieces will perform.

===Marine forces===
[[File:M1A1 firing main gun 3.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines conduct a live-fire exercise with an M1A1 Abrams Tank in Iraq.]]
For the most part [[marine (armed services)|marine]] corps live-fire exercises are similar to the army's live-fire exercises. One notable difference stems from the amphibious nature of a marine force's duty, which can lead the force to incorporate [[amphibious assault ship]]s when they conduct live-fire exercises.

===Air forces===
[[Image:B-2 Spirit bombing, 1994.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[B-2 Spirit]] dropping [[Mark 83 bomb|Mk.82 bombs]] in a 1994 training exercise off [[Point Mugu, California|Pt. Mugu]] in the Pacific Ocean.]]
An [[air force]], due to its nature, usually limits live-fire exercises to the air, although bombing exercises can be conducted as well.

During live-fire exercises dealing with air-to-air combat, remotely controlled [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] are frequently used to simulate enemy [[aircraft]]. In modern times, the drones are fired on by planes loaded with some type of [[air-to-air missile]], with the objective of the exercise being to destroy the drone. These test are usually done to ensure that guidance packages within the missiles will work, although they can be done to test other factors, such as a missile's susceptibility to [[Radar jamming and deception|jamming]] or to see if a new type of dodging technique will work against the missiles fired.

Live-fire exercises involving air-to-surface work are usually centered around [[precision-guided munition]]s. In some cases, tests involving bombs will make use of [[wikt:derelict|derelict]] buildings or, even more frequently, vehicles. Live-fire bombing exercises are usually conducted with precision-guided munitions to ensure that they work correctly, but are also used to test new and experimental weapons to ensure that they work as they were originally designed to. These test are usually monitored by [[chase plane]]s and by cameras to determine if everything worked as it was originally intended to.

Live-fire exercises may also be conducted against planes for the purpose of testing a plane's susceptibility to SAM sites, or as a means to test a plane's stealth features.

===Naval forces===
[[Image:USSTheSullivans-firingmissi.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer}}s fire anti-missile missiles during a live-fire exercise.]]
Naval live-fire exercises may use anti-ship [[missile]]s and [[torpedo]]es, although tests involving air-to-air and [[air-to-surface missile]], guns and bombs are not uncommon. Navies conduct live-fire exercises to test elements of an integrated defense system, such as the US [[Aegis combat system|Aegis]]; namely, its ability to track and destroy enemy [[anti-ship missile]]s. Tests can also include an integrated defense system's compatibility to fire new missiles or newer versions of the same missile. Live-fire tests are also conducted with a [[CIWS]] system, which is designed as the last line of defense for a ship. Surface ships also frequently test-fire the various guns kept and maintained aboard the vessel; these can range from sidearms and rifles up to the [[16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun|16" guns]] of the mothballed US {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship}}s. This is done to maintain the skill and knowledge needed to operate the weapon. In the case of [[aircraft carrier]]s, the pilots assigned to the carrier may conduct air-to-air and air-to-surface missile exercises similar to those of the air force; additionally, these pilots may also conduct live-fire exercises against derelict ships. Recent aircraft carriers have incorporated missile-launching systems, and have taken part in live-fire exercises involving missiles.

For [[submarine]]s, both fast attack and ballistic missile (or "boomers"), live-fire tests may include firing sea-to-land missiles at targets on shore or launching dummy ballistic missiles; however, the most frequent live-fire exercises conducted by submarines involve firing torpedoes at a target. The best-known tests of torpedoes are those conducted against a derelict ship, typically on a ship from a navy's own [[reserve fleet|mothball fleet]] that has become too old or obsolete to warrant maintaining. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the torpedo will work under combat conditions, and such tests can be used to determine whether or not noisemakers or other [[decoy]]s will have any effect against the unit when launched.

===Use against training soldiers===
Some forces, especially in more [[authoritarian]] societies{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}, have also been known to use live ammunition against their own forces in military exercises,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} to ensure that the soldiers 'take their training seriously' and get accustomed to being shot at before facing actual enemies. This kind of fire is usually not intended to kill anyone, though practices such as firing into the ground close to a soldier going through an obstacle course pose obvious risks.&lt;!-- Cannot cite this, but saw a movie about an Arab military training camp 15 years ago in which this was done. Please reference if possible --&gt;

German [[Waffen SS]] training involved the usage of live ammunition, designed to make the soldiers tougher than regular soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waffen-ss.com/page.php?page=100 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130630135835/http://waffen-ss.com/page.php?page=100 |archivedate=30 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]], just after [[Joseph Stalin]] died in 1954, conducted a live [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[Nuclear testing|test]], during exercises at the [[Totskoye range]], against soldiers at a distance believed to be safe when in [[trench]]es. Any immediate deaths can't be proven today, but [[Russia]]n [[human rights]] activists assert that the long aftermath death toll is in the thousands.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

A similar live nuclear test was performed by the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[Marine Corps Test Unit]] and [[US Army]] Armored Task Force "Razor" during exercise [[Operation Teapot|Teapot]] ([[Desert Rock VI]]) at the [[Nevada Test Site]] in 1955.

The British [[Special Air Service|SAS]] and [[Royal Marines]] are also known to use live rounds, for the former during the jungle phase of training, and the latter using live rounds in their final exercise.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The SAS also use live-fire in regular close quarter combat training.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Non-military==
[[Image:CannonWithSmoke.jpg|thumb|left|Cannon in a Civil War [[Historical reenactment|re-enactment]]: The large amounts of gunpowder used often affected visibility significantly. Gunners hope for a strong wind that will allow them to continue to see their target.]]
Weapons tests are not usually conducted by civilian agencies; however, some civilian groups do conduct live-fire tests of equipment to ensure that they work properly or to test new methods. Examples here would include [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] ([[shooting range]]s) and [[controlled explosion]]s by demolition experts. Sometimes, [[historical reenactment]]s, such as those done for the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], will include live-fire demonstrations so the general public can observe historical equipment in action.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Other types==
[[Image:Peacekeeper-missile-testing.jpg|thumb|right|Testing of the [[LG-118A Peacekeeper]] re-entry vehicles, all eight fired from only one missile. Each line represents the path of a warhead which, were it live, would detonate with the explosive power of twenty-five [[Little Boy|Hiroshima-style]] weapons.]]
Other types of live-fire exercises include various [[nuclear testing|nuclear tests]] conducted by the world's nuclear powers. Also in this group are the live-fire tests of new and exotic weaponry like the [[Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb]], or "Mother of all Bombs". Also numbered among the unique weapons tests are test fires of [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBM) and [[multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle]]s. Recently, a new addition was made to this area when live-fire tests began of the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative, nicknamed "[[Strategic Defense Initiative|Star Wars]]". These live-fire tests are aimed at intercepting incoming enemy ballistic missiles before they can detonate over their designated target.

==Dangers==
[[File:US Navy 090226-N-1251W-002 Gunners Mate 1st Class Leland Pasion explains how to inspect rounds for safety before a live-fire exercise aboard the amphibious dock landing ship USS Harpers Ferry (LSD 49).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Inspection for safety before a live-fire exercise]]
[[Image:USS Iowa BB61 Iowa Explosion 1989.jpg|thumb|right|On 19 April 1989, {{USS|Iowa|BB-61|6}}{{'}}s #2 turret [[USS Iowa turret explosion|exploded]] during a routine live-fire training exercise. Forty-seven sailors died as a result of the blast.]]
In any situation in which [[hazardous material]]s are involved there exists the potential for a mishap to occur, and when these mishaps occur the results can be as spectacular as they are deadly. All forms of ordnance contain some type of [[explosive]] charge to launch and, in most cases, detonate, a weapon. If these charges are inappropriately stored or handled the result can be serious injury or death to the person and anyone in the immediate vicinity. Other dangers include faulty guidance and sensory information, which can cause guided ordnance to inadvertently target friendly or neutral units. Advances in technology have helped to reduce, and in some cases eliminate, problems with these materials; nonetheless, extreme care must be given when using or implementing them. For example, the handling of [[gunpowder]] demands the use of [[glove]]s and an area free of [[static electricity]] and other potential sparks which could ignite the powder.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8097">[[File:Local times surface.png|thumb|300px|A sample path of an Itō process together with its surface of local times.]]

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] theory of [[stochastic process]]es, '''local time''' is a stochastic process associated with [[diffusion]] processes such as [[Brownian motion]], that characterizes the amount of time a particle has spent at a given level. Local time appears in various [[stochastic integration]] formulas, such as [[Tanaka's formula]], if the integrand is not sufficiently smooth. It is also studied in statistical mechanics in the context of [[random field]]s.

==Formal definition==
For a real valued diffusion process &lt;math&gt;(B_s)_{s\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;, the local time of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; at the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the stochastic process

:&lt;math&gt;L^x(t) =\int_0^t \delta(x-B_s)\,ds,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Dirac delta function]]. It is a notion invented by [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]]. The basic idea is that &lt;math&gt;L^x(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a (rescaled) measure of how much time &lt;math&gt;B_s&lt;/math&gt; has spent at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; up to time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. It may be written as

:&lt;math&gt; L^x(t) =\lim_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0} \frac{1}{2\varepsilon} \int_0^t 1_{\{ x- \varepsilon &lt; B_s &lt; x+\varepsilon \}} \, ds,&lt;/math&gt;

which explains why it is called the local time of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. For a discrete state-space process &lt;math&gt;(X_s)_{s\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;, the local time can be expressed more simply as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ioannis |last=Karatzas |first2=Steven |last2=Shreve |year=1991 |title=Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus |publisher=Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; L^x(t) =\int_0^t 1_{\{x\}}(X_s) \, ds.&lt;/math&gt;

==Tanaka's formula==
Tanaka's formula provides a definition of local time for an arbitrary continuous semimartingale &lt;math&gt;(X_s)_{s\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; \mathbb R: &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Kallenberg"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kallenberg |title=Foundations of Modern Probability |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=1997 |pages=428–449 |isbn=0387949577 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; L^x(t) = |X_t - x| - |X_0 - x| - \int_{0}^t \left( 1_{(0,\infty)}(X_s - x) - 1_{(-\infty, 0]}(X_s-x) \right) dX_s, \qquad t \geq 0. &lt;/math&gt;
A more general form was proven independently by Meyer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=P. A. |last=Meyer |chapter=Un cours sur les intégrales stochastiques |title=Séminaire de probabilités 1967–1980 |series=[[Lecture Notes in Mathematics|Lect.

If &lt;math&gt; F:\mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is absolutely continuous  with derivative &lt;math&gt; F',&lt;/math&gt; which is of bounded variation, then
: &lt;math&gt; F(X_t) = F(X_0) + \int_{0}^t F'_{-}(X_s) dX_s + \frac12 \int_{-\infty}^\infty L^x(t) dF'(x), &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; F'_{-}&lt;/math&gt; is the left derivative.

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a Brownian motion, then for any &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in(0,1/2)&lt;/math&gt; the field of local times &lt;math&gt; L = (L^x(t))_{x \in \mathbb R, t \geq 0}&lt;/math&gt; has a modification which is a.s. Hölder continuous in &lt;math&gt; x&lt;/math&gt; with exponent &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, uniformly for bounded &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kallenberg2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kallenberg |title=Foundations of Modern Probability |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=1997 |pages=370 |isbn=0387949577 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general,  &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt;  has a modification that is a.s. continuous in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and cadlag in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Tanaka's formula provides the explicit [[Doob–Meyer decomposition theorem|Doob–Meyer decomposition]] for the one-dimensional reflecting Brownian motion, &lt;math&gt;(|B_s|)_{s \geq 0}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Ray–Knight theorems==
The field of local times &lt;math&gt; L_t = (L^x_t)_{x \in E}&lt;/math&gt; associated to a stochastic process on a space &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a well studied topic in the area of random fields. Ray–Knight type theorems relate the field ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; to an associated [[Gaussian process]].

In general Ray–Knight type theorems of the first kind consider the field ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; at a hitting time of the underlying process, whilst theorems of the second kind are in terms of a stopping time at which the field of local times first exceeds a given value.

===First Ray–Knight theorem===
Let (''B''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''t'' ≥ 0&lt;/sub&gt; be a one-dimensional Brownian motion started from ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a'' &gt; 0, and (''W''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''t''≥0&lt;/sub&gt; be a standard two-dimensional Brownian motion ''W''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Define the stopping time at which ''B'' first hits the origin, &lt;math&gt; T = \inf\{t \geq 0 \colon B_t = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;. Ray&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D. |last=Ray |title=Sojourn times of a diffusion process |journal=[[Illinois Journal of Mathematics]] |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=615–630 |year=1963 |doi= |mr=0156383 |zbl=0118.13403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Knight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=F. B. |last=Knight |title=Random walks and a sojourn density process of Brownian motion |journal=[[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=109 |issue=1 |pages=56–86 |year=1963 |jstor=1993647 |doi=10.2307/1993647}}&lt;/ref&gt; (independently) showed that
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\left\{ L^x(T) \colon x \in [0,a]  \right\} \stackrel{\mathcal{D}}{=} \left\{ |W_x|^2 \colon x \in [0,a] \right\} \,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
where (''L''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''t'' ≥ 0&lt;/sub&gt; is the field of local times of (''B''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''t'' ≥ 0&lt;/sub&gt;, and equality is in distribution on ''C''[0, ''a'']. The process |''W''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is known as the squared [[Bessel process]].

===Second Ray–Knight theorem===
Let (''B''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;t ≥ 0&lt;/sub&gt; be a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 ∈ '''R''', and let (''L''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''t'' ≥ 0&lt;/sub&gt; be the associated field of local times. Let ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; be the first time at which the local time at zero exceeds ''a'' &gt; 0
: &lt;math&gt; T_a = \inf \{ t \geq 0 \colon L^0_t &gt; a \}.&lt;/math&gt;
Let (''W''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''t'' ≥ 0&lt;/sub&gt; be an independent one-dimensional Brownian motion started from ''W''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, then&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus |last2=Rosen |title=Markov Processes, Gaussian Processes and Local Times |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |pages=53–56 |isbn=0521863007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\left \{ L^x_{T_a} + W_x^2 \colon x \geq 0 \right \} \stackrel{\mathcal{D}}{=} \left\{ (W_x + \sqrt a )^2 \colon x \geq 0 \right \}. \,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
Equivalently, the process &lt;math&gt;(L^x_{T_a})_{x \geq 0}&lt;/math&gt; (which is a process in the spatial variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) is equal in distribution to the square of a 0-dimensional [[Bessel process]], and as such is Markovian.

===Generalized Ray–Knight theorems===
Results of Ray–Knight type for more general stochastic processes have been intensively studied, and analogue statements of both ({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}) are known for strongly symmetric Markov processes.

'''Global [[mangrove]] distributions''' have fluctuated throughout human and [[Geology|geological]] history. The area covered by mangroves is influenced by a complex interaction between land position, [[rain]]fall [[hydrology]], [[sea level]], [[sedimentation]], [[subsidence]], storms and pest-predator relationships&lt;ref name="Eslami-Andargoli et al. 2009"&gt;Eslami-Andargoli, L., Dale, P. et al.

==Mangrove declines==

=== Global trends ===

In the last five decades, worldwide mangrove area has fallen across all regions.&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002"&gt;Alongi, D. M. 2002. Present state and future of the world's mangrove forests. Environmental Conservation, 29, 331–349.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;FAO 2007. The World's Mangroves 1980–2005. FAO Forestry Paper. Rome: Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) no.153&lt;/ref&gt; Different data sources or survey methods make estimates more problematic, as many nations have high variations of mangrove change.&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbier and Sathirathai 2004"&gt;Barbier, E. &amp; Sathirathai, S. 2004. Shrimp farming and mangrove loss in Thailand, Cheltenham, Edward Elgar Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Percentage of original area lost per year'''
* Asia: 1.52%
* Africa: 1.25%
* Australia: 1.99%
* Americas: 3.62%
* The World: 2.07%

(based on data from)&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001"/&gt; ''(Annual loss rates  calculated from the mean number of years between original area and present area for each region: 24, 25, 7, 11, and 17
years for Asia, Africa, Australia, the Americas, and the world, respectively.) ''

From 2000 to 2012, the global mangrove deforestation rate was between 0.16% and 0.39% annually but as high as 3.58% to 8.08% in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The most recent and comprehensive global assessment of mangrove distribution was conducted by Hamilton and Casey (2016) and provides a high-resolution global database of mangrove loss at the 1 arc-second level at annual intervals from 2000 to 2012 with estimates for 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  In the 1980s and 1990s the greatest amount of loss occurred, while in the period of 2000 to 2005 the rate has fallen significantly across all regions.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; Some projections estimate that worldwide mangrove area will decline by a further 25% by 2025, particularly in developing nations.&lt;ref name="McLeod and Salm 2006"&gt;McLeod, E. &amp; Salm, R. V. 2006. Managing mangroves for resilience to climate change. Gland, Switzerland: The World Conservation Union (IUCN)&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that since 1970, 28% of mangrove lost has been directly displaced by commercial aquaculture.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 585–601"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=Stuart|date=2013-04-01|title=Assessing the Role of Commercial Aquaculture in Displacing Mangrove Forest|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/2013/00000089/00000002/art00013|journal=Bulletin of Marine Science|volume=89|issue=2|pages=585–601|doi=10.5343/bms.2012.1069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of perception===
People’s [[perception]] of mangrove ecosystems has been instrumental in the loss of mangroves. Commonly, they have been undervalued and considered ‘wastelands’ with low [[productivity]] (,&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McLeod and Salm 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krauss et al. 2008"&gt;Krauss, K. W., Lovelock, C. E., McKee, K. L., Lopez-Hoffman, L., Ewe, S. M. L. &amp; Sousa, W. P. 2008. Environmental drivers in mangrove establishment and early development: A review. Aquatic Botany, 89, 105–127.&lt;/ref&gt;). Concerns for the fate of mangroves have historically been restricted to [[Scientific community|scientific communities]], with little transfer of knowledge to [[Local community|local communities]] and governments.&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001"/&gt; Mangroves are a [[Common-pool resource|common pool resource]], creating difficulties in enforcing restrictions on exploitative activities.&lt;ref name="Idrus 2009"&gt;Idrus, M. R. 2009. Hard habits to break : investigating coastal resource utilisations and management systems in Sulawesi, Indonesia : a thesis submitted in partial of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Environmental Science at the University of Canterbury.&lt;/ref&gt;
More recently, perceptions have shifted to a broader acknowledgment within communities and governments of the value of mangroves in coastal ecosystems and local communities. The declining rate of mangrove loss since 2000 across all regions is indicative of this, bringing forth an increasing number of [[Conservation biology|conservation]] projects and [[legislation]].&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

===Causes of decline===
A variety of factors have led to the declining trends in mangrove distribution (refer to table fig of causes). These factors are predominantly [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] in origin, as mangrove destruction is positively [[Correlation and dependence|correlated]] to human population density.&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt; Up to 35% of mangrove forests worldwide have been lost since 1980, reflecting the increased pressure from high population densities residing at the [[coast]].&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; Mangrove losses to climate change are considered a probable long term threat to future distribution.&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McLeod and Salm 2006"/&gt; Despite a wide variety of factors linked to mangrove loss (insert figure of causes), the main drivers of recent (i.e. after 1980) mangrove destruction are linked to four main activities: [[urban sprawl]], [[tourism]], [[agriculture]] and [[aquaculture]].&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farnsworth and Ellison 1997"&gt;Farnsworth, E. J. &amp; Ellison, A. M. 1997. The global conservation status of mangroves. Ambio, 328–334.&lt;/ref&gt; The causes of declines in mangrove areas vary between regions. In [[Asia]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]], aquaculture and tourism development are the greatest threat.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; In [[Oceania]], tourism development is the greatest threat while in [[Africa]], conversion of mangroves for agricultural and urban development is most apparent.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

'''Aquaculture''' – This activity is considered the greatest contributor to worldwide mangrove loss.&lt;ref name="Barbier and Sathirathai 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McLeod and Salm 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton 585–601"/&gt; Since the 1980s, [[shrimp]] aquaculture dramatically increased, replacing mangroves with ponds and degrading surrounding areas with associated pollution.&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dierbergand and Kiattisimkul 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt;  Aquaculture has dramatically affected some regions. For example, 50-80% of mangroves were lost in Asia in the past decades.&lt;ref name="Farnsworth and Ellison 1997" /&gt; Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America have been most affected by aquaculture&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt;

[[File:Lone house in Petite-Anse (1180932461).jpg|thumb|Urban expansion - Urban development on mangrove habitat in [[Cap-Haitien, Haiti]]]]

'''Urban expansion''' – As population density increases at the coast, areas of mangrove forest have been replaced to provide urban and [[Industry|industrial]] lands.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

'''Tourism''' – infrastructure supporting tourism often requires the reclamation of substantial tracts of mangrove forests.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; In the Americas and Oceania, tourism is a major driver of mangrove loss. Where tourism is a main contributor to an [[economy]] (such as Pacific Island nations), construction of [[resort]]s and related [[infrastructure]]s have reduced mangrove area in past decades.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

'''Agriculture''' – Conversion of mangrove forests for agriculture has occurred across all regions historically, freeing up land for activities such as rice or [[salt]] production (.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farnsworth and Ellison 1997"/&gt;

====Mangrove loss case study: shrimp aquaculture in South-east Asia====
In many South-east Asian nations, shrimp aquaculture has been instrumental in mangrove loss, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dierbergand and Kiattisimkul 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; Due to high economic returns, shrimp farming was promoted to improve economic conditions in many countries.&lt;ref name="Dierbergand and Kiattisimkul 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbier and Sathirathai 2004" /&gt; The social and economic benefits of shrimp farming are substantial.&lt;ref name="Dierbergand and Kiattisimkul 1996" /&gt; Shrimp farms are located close to the coast to reduce costs by using [[Tide|tidal]] energy and short [[canal]] lengths to the coast.&lt;ref name="Dierbergand and Kiattisimkul 1996" /&gt; Consequently, vast tracts of mangrove forest have been replaced by numerous ponds. Compounding mangrove losses is the short life span of individual ponds (5–10 years), imposing a [[shifting cultivation]] pattern to shrimp farming.&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001"/&gt;

After 1980, shrimp farming became far more [[intensive]], with high productivity (per unit area) ponds proliferating across the landscape.&lt;ref name="Dierbergand and Kiattisimkul 1996" /&gt; Dramatic reductions in mangrove forests were reported with shrimp pond intensification. In [[Thailand]], mangrove forests literally halved between 1975–1993&lt;ref name="Aksornkoae and Tokrishna 2004"&gt;Aksornkoae, S. &amp; Tokrishna, R. 2004. Overview of shrimp farming and mangrove loss in Thailand. In: Barbier, E. &amp; Sathirathai, S. (eds.) Shrimp farming and mangrove loss in Thailand. Cheltenham Edward Elgar Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of such losses has been linked to the disruption of [[Ecology|ecological]] and economic functioning of mangroves.&lt;ref name="Barbier and Sathirathai 2004" /&gt; For example, loss of income for local Thai fishermen has been reported due to reduced catches from the degradation of [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] fish habitat.&lt;ref name="Barbier and Sathirathai 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aksornkoae and Tokrishna 2004" /&gt;
Some consider that the number of shrimp farms in South-east Asia peaked in the late 1990s, with the rate of mangrove loss declining accordingly.&lt;ref name="Aksornkoae and Tokrishna 2004" /&gt; This decline is in part due to increased [[Conservation biology|conservation]] and [[Restoration ecology|restoration]] projects, and improved [[management]] practices.

===Global climate change and mangrove loss===
Increases in temperature, CO2, precipitation, storms, and sea level are likely to threaten mangroves in the future.&lt;ref name="McLeod and Salm 2006"/&gt; Sea level rise is considered the greatest [[climate change]] related threat to mangrove regions.&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McLeod and Salm 2006"/&gt; The natural ability of mangroves to ‘keep up’ with rising [[sea level]] through [[peat]] or [[sediment]] accumulation could be exceeded, leading to mangrove die back.&lt;ref name="Ellison 1993"&gt;Ellison, J. C. 1993. Mangrove retreat with rising sea-level, Bermuda. [[Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science]], 37, 75–87.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Low island]] mangroves are most at risk, as demonstrated in [[Bermuda]], where sea level rise has exceeded peat accumulation rates periodically, resulting in landward die back of mangrove stands.&lt;ref name="Ellison 1993" /&gt; Climate change may reduce global mangrove area by 10-15%, but it is a long term, less significance threat to the current 1-2% annual loss from human activities.&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt;

==Mangrove expansions==

=== Global trends ===

Several nations have experienced an expansion of their mangrove area. These expansions include human activities promoting seaward or landward expansion from climatic or other local factors, as well as conservation and [[reforestation]] programmes.&lt;ref name="Morrisey et al. 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farnsworth and Ellison 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saintilan and Wilton 2001" /&gt; Globally, this stability and expansion is far outweighed by the magnitude of mangrove loss from human activities.

===Seaward expansion and human activity===
Seaward mangrove expansion is considered a natural response to high inputs of sediment and nutrients from human activity in adjacent [[Catchment area (human geography)|catchments]];.&lt;ref name="Morrisey et al. 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harty 2009"&gt;Harty, C. 2009. Mangrove planning and management in New Zealand and South East Australia - A reflection on approaches. Ocean and Coastal Management, 52, 278–286.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovelock et al 2007"&gt;Lovelock, C. E., Feller, I. C., Ellis, J., Schwarz, A. M., Hancock, N., Nichols, P. &amp; Sorrell, B. 2007. Mangrove growth in New Zealand estuaries: The role of nutrient enrichment at sites with contrasting rates of sedimentation.&lt;/ref&gt; Mangroves naturally encourage [[sediment]] deposition by slowing [[Ocean current|currents]] and attenuating [[Wind wave|waves]]. However, with high [[sediment]] inputs, the elevation of [[intertidal]] flats can rise above the [[low tide]] limit of the original mangrove forest, resulting in a seaward expansion of new mangrove [[habitat]].&lt;ref name="Morrisey et al. 2007" /&gt; Once new mangroves establish, they too begin to trap more sediment, raising the tidal flat elevation and generating more mangrove habitat.&lt;ref name="Morrisey et al. 2007" /&gt; Seaward expansions are likely in regions with modified catchments (i.e. deforestation or urban development) with high topography where high sediments loads are delivered to mangroves at the coast.&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt; Extremely high rates of sediment input can exceed tolerance thresholds and induce mangrove die backs.&lt;ref name="Krauss et al. 2008"/&gt; Excess sedimentation is the primary control, but [[nutrients]] (i.e. from [[agricultural runoff]]) can enhance mangrove expansion, particularly when combined with high levels of [[sedimentation]].&lt;ref name="Lovelock et al 2007" /&gt; Seaward expansions highlight the interconnectivity of mangrove ecosystems to adjacent catchments and the need to consider catchment alteration when managing mangroves.

====Case study: New Zealand mangroves====
In [[New Zealand]] (NZ), [[temperate]] mangroves (Avicennia marina) are common in [[estuaries]], harbours and [[tidal]] creeks north of 38° latitude.&lt;ref name="Morrisey et al. 2007" /&gt; Following [[European colonization]], mangrove area declined, but since the 1970s rapid, ongoing seaward expansion has occurred in many areas.&lt;ref name="Morrisey et al. 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovelock et al 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Park 2004"&gt;Park, S. 2004. Aspects of Mangrove Distribution and Abundance in Tauranga Harbour. Whakatane: Environment Bay of Plenty, 2004/16.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the last 50 years mangrove area has expanded 120% in Tuaranga Harbour.&lt;ref name="Park 2004" /&gt; Such expansion is strongly correlated with elevated rates of sediment deposition. [[Drainage basin|Catchment]] activities such as [[deforestation]] and more recently, [[urban development]] have been blamed for the expansion.&lt;ref name="Morrisey et al. 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovelock et al 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Park 2004" /&gt;
Considerable debate over whether to protect or remove NZ mangroves exist. Proponents for protection cite the ecological and coastal protection values of mangrove stands, while removal advocates aim to restore recreational values and prevent encroachment into non-mangrove ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt; A shift in the management strategy of regional councils from protection to mangrove ‘management’ has occurred recently&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="De Luca 2009"&gt;De Luca, S. 2009. Mangrove Management - Balancing Values. Coastal News, NZ no. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Removals may take place when human amenities or non-mangrove habitats are deemed threatened by mangrove encroachment.&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="De Luca 2009" /&gt; Some researchers caution comparisons being made between NZ and [[tropical]] mangroves, suggesting NZ mangroves are unique in their ecology and require a tailored [[management]] approach.&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt;

===Landward expansion===
In contrast to seaward expansions in NZ, [[landward]] expansions are documented in a number of regions ([[Thailand]], Australia, and [[Hawaii]]).&lt;ref name="Eslami-Andargoli et al. 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saintilan and Wilton 2001"&gt;Saintilan, N. &amp; Wilton, K. 2001. Changes in the distribution of mangroves and saltmarshes in Jervis Bay, Australia. Wetlands Ecology and Management, 9, 409–420.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chimner et al. 2006"&gt;Chimner, R. A., Fry, B., Kaneshiro, M. Y. &amp; Cormier, N. 2006. Current Extent and Historical Expansion of Introduced Mangroves on O'ahu, Hawai'i1. Pacific Science, 60, 377–383&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of landward expansions is not always clear. In Eastern Australia expansions have replaced salt marshes with various suggestions for the cause of landward expansion (increased rainfall, changes in hydrology, to local subsidence).&lt;ref name="Eslami-Andargoli et al. 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saintilan and Wilton 2001" /&gt; Expansions in Hawaii are thought to be the result of invasions by [[Invasive species|exotic]] mangrove species.&lt;ref name="Chimner et al. 2006" /&gt;

===Expansion through conservation and restoration===
More recently, awareness of the economic, social, and [[ecological]] values of mangroves have led to an increase in the number of initiatives to protect and restore mangrove areas.&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; Broader recognition of the connection of mangroves to coastal food chains, [[coastal protection]] and [[socio-economic]] welfare has driven recent conservation.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; For example, [[Bangladesh]] has undertaken extensive coastal afforesation (mass plantings) projects since 1966, leading to an increase in mangrove area in recent decades;&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saenger N. A. 1993"&gt;Saenger, N. A. 1993. Land from the sea: the mangrove afforestation program of Bangladesh. Ocean &amp; Coastal Management, 20, 23–39&lt;/ref&gt; 2005;.&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt; Many nations with mangroves have signed on to the 1971 [[Ramsar Convention]] on wetlands in the last two decades, making a commitment to [[wetland]] preservation.&lt;ref name="Ramsar 1971"&gt;Ramsar. 1971. Ramsar Convention on Wetlands [Online]. Available: http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-about-about-ramsar/main/ramsar/1-36%5E7687_4000_0__ [Accessed April 2010].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the adoption of protective [[legislation]] is not evenly spread. For instance, community initiatives to protect mangroves are common in Africa but little legislation exists compared to other regions, such as Asia.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

==Challenges, limitations and future suggestions==
Much attention has been given to mangroves by the [[scientific community]], as well as a largely universal acknowledgement among communities and governments of the ecological and economic values.&lt;ref name="Farnsworth and Ellison 1997"/&gt; Despite this awareness, global mangrove area continues to decline through human activities. A lack of communication between [[biologists]], effected residents, and governments could partly account for this.&lt;ref name="Farnsworth and Ellison 1997"/&gt; Calls have been made for greater [[collaboration]] between international researchers and residents of affected nations.
Efforts to assess changes in worldwide mangrove distribution have been hindered by a lack of long term data, or limited to no data at all for some nations.&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farnsworth and Ellison 1997"/&gt; Without accurate data on distributions, an accurate forecast of mangrove loss or expansion becomes problematic. This in turn may hinder the progress of [[Conservation biology|conservation]] projects.
Despite large volumes of [[scientific literature]] on [[mangroves]], many uncertainties still exist. These include how mangroves will respond to increases in greenhouse gases and sea level, [[sustainable]] yields for silviculture, the difference in ecological functioning between tropical and [[temperate]] species, and why within the same species we get seaward and landward expansions.&lt;ref name="Morrisey et al. 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt; Obtaining this knowledge will help nations to better predict future mangrove behavior, and administer appropriate [[management]] policies.

==Summary==
Mangrove loss has been a worldwide trend for the last 50 years due primarily to [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] activities that compete for land area. Expansions in mangrove area do occur, but have a limited ability to offset the extensive losses. Recently the rate of loss has been declining due to a greater awareness of mangrove values, with legislation and conservation projects becoming more commonplace. It can only be hoped that this declining rate of loss continues, allowing future generations to appreciate the many benefits of mangroves.

'''Media and gender''' refers to the relationship between [[Media (communication)|media]] and [[gender]], and how gender is represented within [[media platform]]s. These platforms include but are not limited to [[film]], [[television]], [[journalism]], and [[video game]]s.
Initiatives and resources exist to promote [[gender equality]] and reinforce women's [[empowerment]] in the media industry and representations. For example, [[UNESCO]], in cooperation with the [[International Federation of Journalists]], elaborated the [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/crosscutting-priorities/gender-and-media/gender-sensitive-indicators-for-media/ Gender-sensitive Indicators for Media] contributing to [[gender equality]] and women's [[empowerment]] in all forms of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/crosscutting-priorities/gender-and-media/gender-sensitive-indicators-for-media/|title=Gender-Sensitive Indicators for Media: Framework of indicators to gauge gender sensitivity in media operations and content {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Feminism|Feminist]] writers, largely gaining prominence in the 1960s during [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminism]], began criticizing the [[Western canon]] for providing and promoting an exclusively white male [[world view]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Have We Got a Theory for You! Feminist Theory, Cultural Imperialism and the Demand for "The Woman's Voice"|last=Lugones|first=Maria C.|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=1983|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These feminists typically perceive gender as a social construct which is not only reflected in artistic work but perpetuated by it.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism|last=Treichler|first=Paula|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until fairly recently, feminists have mainly directed their studies to gender representations in literature.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Gender disparity in media careers ==
Numbers of women in media professions, such as journalism, is growing; however, the media is and has been statistically dominated by men, who hold the vast majority of power positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.metiers-presse.org/explore.php#stack/alljournalists/journalistNumber/ageSlice/genderDistribution/none/2014/none|title=La répartition du nombre de journalistes par tranches d’âge et par sexe en 2014|work=Espace Data - Observatoire des métiers de la presse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that men are more likely to be quoted than women in the media, and more likely to cover "serious" topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensmediacenter.com/pages/the-problem|title=The Problem|publisher=Women's Media Center|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210092107/http://www.womensmediacenter.com/pages/the-problem|archivedate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bechdel test]], originally created to evaluate popular fiction's representation of women and subsequently adapted to employment in the media professions, show that a number of women are employed but do not benefit from an equal voice. For example, women's presence on [[radio]] is typically hired to cover topics such as weather and [[culture]].

In the [[video game industry]] about half of the [[gamer]]s are women but their presence is still limited in the production of games. Those who tried to publicly challenge this situation, such as [[Anita Sarkeesian|A. Sarkeesian]], have been subjected to harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvey|first1=A.|year=2015|title="Everyone Can Make Games!": The post-feminist context of women in digital game production|url=https://zenodo.org/record/849069|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=15|issue=4|pages=576–592|doi=10.1080/14680777.2014.958867}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cinema there is concern about the low number of female [[Film director|director]]s and the difficulties of older actresses to find roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/10/100-women-directors-hollywood-should-be-hiring.html|title=100 Women Directors Hollywood Should Be Hiring|last=Buchanan|first=Kyle|date=November 2, 2015|work=Vulture}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-women-directors-20150222-story.html|title=Oscars 2015: Female directors scarce at Hollywood's major studios|last=Keegan|first=Rebecca|date=February 22, 2015|work=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also earn 2.5 times less income than men in the same jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Smith L., Stacy|author2=Choueiti, Marc|author3=Pieper, Katherine|year=2014|title=Gender bias without borders: An investigation of female characters in popular films across 11 countries|url=https://seejane.org/wp-content/uploads/gender-bias-without-borders-full-report.pdf|publisher=Media, Diversity, &amp; Social Change Initiative. University of Southern California, Annenberg School for Communication &amp; Journalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey conducted by [[Stacy Smith]] of the [[University of Southern California]] shows that only 7% of directors, 13% of [[writer]]s and 20% of [[Film producer|producer]]s in film and television are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theairspace.net/insight/gender-equality-in-the-media-the-new-social-movement/|title=Gender Equality in the Media: The New Social Movement|last1=McSweeney|first1=Melissa|website=The AirSpace|accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to The Writers Guild, an estimated 17% of screenplays over the last decade were written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Charlotte|date=2000|title=MOVIES; Her Type Is Strong, Not Silent; Susannah Grant is making waves in the male-dominated world of screenwriting with her latest films centering on determined women.: [Home Edition]|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/421663810?OpenUrlRefId=info:xri/sid:wcdiscovery&amp;accountid=11411|journal=Los Angeles Times|volume=|pages=|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, increasing numbers of women work in the media as journalists or directors. Therefore, they deal with topics tightly related to women's needs and tend to provide a positive role for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsdrc.org/topic-guides/gender/gender-and-media/|title=Gender and media|author1=Ann Kangas|author2=Huma Haider|date=July 2015|publisher=GSDRC|author3=Erika Fraser|author4=Evie Browne}}&lt;/ref&gt; No longer only consumers of media but also contributors to media, they get more involved in decision-making and agenda of activities. This empowerment of women gives them abilities to promote balance in gender representations and avoid stereotypes. Media becomes a suitable ground for expressions and claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender in the Information Society: Emerging Issues|author1=Pavarala, V.|author2=Malik, K. K.|author3=Cheeli, J.

== Representations of women ==

=== Underrepresentation ===
According to the report investigation of female characters in popular films across 11 countries, 1 woman for 2.24 men appeared on the screen between January 1, 2010 and May 1, 2013. In 2009, the [[Screen Actors Guild|Screen Actors Guild (US)]] also found that men continue to make up the majority of roles, especially [[Supporting Roles|supporting roles]], where they contribute around two roles for every female role, whereas females hold a slightly larger proportion of [[lead role]]s compared to their proportion of supporting roles, but still less than lead roles occupied by male counterparts.

The same is true for [[television programs]]. In general, from the 1950s to the 1970s, television programs had 30-35% female roles in American TV shows.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Media, Gender and Identity: An Introduction|last1=Gauntlett|first1=David|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-39661-5|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female roles increased in the 1980s, but there were still twice as many roles for men in television.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; However, these disparities change depending on the type of program: in mid-1970s [[sitcom]]s there were "nearly equal proportions", whereas in [[Action-adventure (disambiguation)|action-adventure shows]] "only 15 per cent of the leading characters were women".&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; In the 1980s, female characters represented 43% of roles in comedy shows and only 29% in action-adventure programs, however, they had outnumbered male characters two to one in dramas.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; Since the 1990s, "gender roles on television seemed to become increasingly equal and non-stereotyped ... although the majority of lead characters were still male."&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt;

The [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media]] is an organisation that has been lobbying the industry for years to expand the roles of women in film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21737490-furore-hollywood-will-result-different-stories-making-it-screen|title=The aftermath of the Weinstein scandal|website=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, feminists such as [[Clare Short]], Gaye Tuchman, and [[Angela McRobbie]] denounced unfair representations of gender in media and especially in magazines.

=== Sexualization ===
The [[Western world|Western]] ideal of female beauty is that of the fit, young and thin woman, and the media spreads this ideal through movies, TV shows, [[fashion show]]s, advertisements, magazines and newspapers, music videos, and children's [[cartoon]]s. For women to be considered attractive, they have to conform to images in advertisements, television, and music portraying the ideal woman as tall, white, thin, with a 'tubular' body and blonde hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4795|title=Female Body Image and the Mass Media: Perspectives on How Women Internalize the Ideal Beauty Standard|author=Serdar, K.L.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428172944/http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4795|archivedate=2016-04-28|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2016-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies show that typical female roles fall into cultural stereotypes of women and are often sexualized with minimal clothing and sexualized roles.&lt;ref name="Collins2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Rebecca L.|date=2011|title=Content Analysis of Gender Roles in Media: Where Are We Now and Where Should We Go?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11199-010-9929-5|journal=Sex Roles|volume=64|issue=3|pages=290–298|doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9929-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a content analysis of video games found that "41% of female characters wore revealing clothing and an equal number were partially or totally nude", whereas the male characters were not.&lt;ref name="Downs2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Downs|first1=Edward|last2=Smith|first2=Stacy L.|date=2010|title=Keeping Abreast of Hypersexuality: A Video Game Character Content Analysis|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11199-009-9637-1|journal=Sex Roles|volume=62|issue=11|pages=721–733|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9637-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[sexualization]] is not the only stereotypical way in which women are represented in the media.

In advertisement, celebrity endorsement of products are thought to be especially effective if the celebrity is a physically attractive woman, as the attractiveness is thought to transfer to the brand's image and studies have shown that audiences respond better to female endorsements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chan, Kara; Yu Leung Ng; Luk, Edwin K. Young Consumers; Bradford|first=|date=2013|title=Impact of celebrity endorsement in advertising on brand image among Chinese adolescents|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1365799498?OpenUrlRefId=info:xri/sid:wcdiscovery&amp;accountid=11411|journal=Emerald Publishing|volume=14|pages=167–179|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[objectification]] of women in the media is transmitted verbally and nonverbally, as well as directly and indirectly, and it is not only visual but can also be expressed subtly by commenting on women's appearance in a humorous way, making jokes and gags, and using double meanings.&lt;ref name="Galdi3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galdi|first1=Silvia|last2=Maass|first2=Anne|last3=Cadinu|first3=Mara|date=2014|title=Objectifying Media: Their Effect on Gender Role Norms and Sexual Harassment of Women|url=http://pwq.sagepub.com/content/38/3/398|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=38|issue=3|pages=398–413|doi=10.1177/0361684313515185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some shows focused entirely on successful professional women and their "quests for sex, pleasure and romantic love", such as ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' (1997–2002) and ''[[Sex and the City]]'' (1998–2004).&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; Even if the main character in Ally McBeal was portrayed as desperate to find a husband, the show had other non-stereotypical female characters and "sided with the women".&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt;  ''Sex and the City'' had assertive female protagonists, especially in matters of sex, and did not punish them for wanting pleasure, knowing how to get it, and being determined to do so, which can be seen especially in the case of [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]], played by [[Kim Cattrall]].&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; Another female icon from the 1990s is the title character on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', a teenage girl who starred and became hugely popular in the "typically male-dominated world of [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] fans".&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; [[Buffy Summers]], played by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], was powerful, heroic, confident, and assertive, characteristics that were generally ascribed to male characters.

In her 1973 article "[[Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema]]", feminist film critic [[Laura Mulvey]] coined the term [[Male gaze|male-gaze]] to describe the way that women in film serve as projections of male fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|date=1 October 1975|title=Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema|url=https://academic.oup.com/screen/article-abstract/16/3/6/1603296?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Screen|volume=16|pages=6–7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestication ===
On TV, marriage, parenthood, and domesticity have been shown as more important to women than men.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; From the mid-1940s to the 1960s, women (predominantly white, middle-class women) were portrayed mostly as housewives who had seemingly "perfect" lives: their houses were always impeccably clean, their children were always healthy, and they were always beautiful and organized.&lt;ref name="Zeisler3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Feminism and Pop Culture|last1=Zeisler|first1=Andi|date=2008|publisher=Seal Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; TV didn't portray the reality that by 1960 "40 per cent of women worked outside the home ... [and that] divorce rates spiked twice after World War II".&lt;ref name="Zeisler3"/&gt; According to a study from 1975 conducted by Jean McNeil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNeil|first1=Jean|date=1975|title=Feminism, Femininity and the Television Shows: A Content Analysis|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08838157509363786|journal=Journal of Broadcasting|volume=19|issue=3|pages=259–269|doi=10.1080/08838157509363786}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 74 per cent of the cases studied women's interactions were "concerned with romance or family problems", whereas men's interactions were concerned with these matters in only 18 per cent of the cases.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; Furthermore, female characters often didn't have jobs, especially if they were wives and mothers, and were not the dominant characters or [[Decision-making|decision-makers]].&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; The boss is usually a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.iwmf.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IWMF-Global-Report-Summary.pdf|title=Global Report on the Status of Women in the News Media|author=Byerly, C.

As one study about gender role portrayals in advertisements from seven countries' shows, women are more likely to play the role of the [[Housekeeping|housekeeper]] and men are more likely to play the roles of professionals.&lt;ref name="Paek2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paek|first1=Hye-Jin|last2=Nelson|first2=Michelle R.|last3=Vilela|first3=Alexandra M.|date=2011|title=Examination of Gender-role Portrayals in Television Advertising across Seven Countries|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11199-010-9850-y|journal=Sex Roles|volume=64|issue=3|pages=192–207|doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9850-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, Souha R. Ezzedeen found that career-driven female characters in film are often portrayed as failing at fulfilling the stereotypical roles of a woman, like sexual attraction, maternal roles, and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ezzedeen|first=Souha R.|date=2015|title=Portrayals of career women in Hollywood films: implications for the glass ceiling's persistence|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1675843005?OpenUrlRefId=info:xri/sid:wcdiscovery&amp;accountid=11411|journal=Gender in Management|volume=30|pages=239–264|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Age gap ===

Older characters and actors in general tend to be underrepresented in most media; however, this seems to specifically effect female actors who appear less frequently in film and television than their male colleagues and younger women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2015/04/is-2015-the-year-of-the-older-actress-203907/|title=Is 2015 the Year of the Older Actress?|last=Berger|first=Laura|date=April 22, 2015|work=IndieWire}}&lt;/ref&gt; While 40+ male roles are on the rise in both theatrical and television productions, female 40+ roles represent only 28% of female roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sag.org/press-releases/october-23-2009/latest-casting-data-follows-historical-trends-and-continues-exclude-p|title=Latest casting data follows historical trends and continues to exclude people with disabilities|date=October 23, 2009|publisher=Screen Actors Guild}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actors such as [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Clint Eastwood]] continue to undertake major roles as ageless heroes, whereas the normative structure for older women is that their ageing is part of the plot (for example in ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' (2008) and [[Sex and the City (film)|''Sex and the City'']] (2010)).&lt;ref name="Fairclough, K. 20122"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fairclough|first1=K|year=2012|title=Nothing less than perfect: female celebrity, ageing and hyper-scrutiny in the gossip industry|url=http://doi.org/10.1080/19392397.2012.644723|journal=Celebrity Studies|volume=3|issue=1|pages=90–103|doi=10.1080/19392397.2012.644723}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typically seen in relation to female roles relying on sexualization and the superficial (apparent) effects of aging on their body are presented as something to be hidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Calasanti, Toni|author2=Kathleen F. Slevin|author3=Neal King|date=13 November 2017|title=Ageism and Feminism: From "Et Cetera" to Center|journal=NWSA Journal|publisher=|volume=18|issue=1|pages=13–30|doi=10.2307/4317183|jstor=4317183}}&lt;/ref&gt; They continue to be defined mainly by their appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=L'assignation de genre dans les médias : attentes, perturbations, reconfigurations|author1=Damian, B.|author2=Montañola, S.|author3=Olivesi, A.|publisher=Presses universitaires de Rennes|year=2014|isbn=978-2-7535-2905-2|location=Rennes|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In gossip culture, the older female body is represented in largely negative terms unless it has been modified "correctly" by cosmetic surgery.&lt;ref name="Fairclough, K. 20122" /&gt; Aging female celebrities have become one of the mainstays of gossip magazines and blogs, which endorse a culture of consumption in which cosmetic technologies and procedures are not questioned but in which female celebrities who have used them are either figured as glamorous for getting it right or as monstrous for going too far.&lt;ref name="doi.org2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jermyn, D.|date=2012|title="Get a life, ladies.

This has led to critiques that these representations are first and foremost framed in terms of how well older actresses are managing their aging bodies.&lt;ref name="Fairclough, K. 20122" /&gt; Midlife women have grown accustomed to seeing their age group portrayed in a seemingly unrealistic way, and this had led to an increase of eating disorders and negative body image among this group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hefner|first=Veronica|date=Summer 2014|title=The Influence of Television and Film Viewing on Midlife Women's Body Image, Disordered Eating, and Food Choice|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=65fa7055-cd70-453b-8863-f0b372478d63%40sessionmgr4006&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=95678398&amp;db=ufh|journal=Media and Psychology|volume=17|pages=185–207|doi=10.1080/15213269.2013.838903|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one court case in 2011, English television actress [[Miriam O'Reilly]] successfully sued the [[BBC]] for [[age discrimination]] after being dropped from a show. It was claimed that she had been told to be careful about her wrinkles and to consider [[Botulinum toxin|Botox]] and dyeing her hair.&lt;ref name="doi.org2" /&gt;

The commercial potential of older consumers is becoming more significant (an increased 'active [[lifespan]]', the [[Baby boomers|baby boom]] generation entering retirement, retirement ages that are raising). A multiplication of images of successful aging are explicitly tied to consumerism by the anti-ageing industry and older female celebrities advertising their products.&lt;ref name="doi.org2" /&gt; Examples abound: [[Sharon Stone]] for [[Christian Dior]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] for [[Elizabeth Arden]], [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Julianna Margulies]] for [[L'Oreal]], [[Christy Turlington]] for [[Maybelline]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]] for [[CoverGirl]], etc. These advertisements are paradoxical in that they allow older celebrities to remain visible while encouraging an ageist and [[Sexism|sexist]] culture in which women are valued for their appearance. Baby boomers are an increasingly important audience group for the cinema industry, resulting in more and new kinds of stories with older [[protagonist]]s. [[Romantic comedy|Romantic comedies]] in which women protagonists take on the [[Romance (love)|romantic]] [[hero]]ine role provide one of the few spaces in [[popular culture]] showing appealing representations of older women, such as ''[[I Could Never Be Your Woman]]'' (2007), ''[[Last Chance Harvey]]'' (2008), and ''[[It's Complicated (film)|It's Complicated]]'' (2009). They are part of a phenomenon called the "girling" of older women, where the protagonists and celebrities are portrayed as being just as excited and entitled to be going out on dates as younger women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jermyn, D.|date=2012|title="Glorious, glamorous and that old standby, amorous": the late blossoming of Diane Keaton's romantic comedy career|journal=Celebrity Studies|publisher=|volume=3|issue=1|pages=37–51|doi=10.1080/19392397.2012.644718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abuse ===
Heterosexual romantic relationships in media, particularly in film, often romanticize intimate partner violence wherein the woman is the victim. Films like [[Twilight (2008 film)|''Twilight'']] (2008), ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey (film)|Fifty Shades of Gray]]'' (2015), and ''[[Once Were Warriors (film)|Once Were Warriors]]'' (1994) are all examples of films in which abusive behavior, such as manipulation, coercion, threats, control and domination, isolation, excessive jealousy, and physical violence, are all exhibited by the male romantic lead.&lt;ref&gt;Bonomi, Amy E., et al. “The Abuse Litmus Test: A Classroom Tool to Assess Power and Control in On-Screen Relationships.” Family Relations, vol. 66, no. 1, Feb. 2017, pp. 154–165. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1111/fare.12237.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study on women's interpretations of abusive behavior found that many women see the sort of abusive behaviors shown in popular films as romantic or desirable. This conflation of abuse and romance is widely attributed to the prevalence of abusive tropes in popular media. &lt;ref&gt;Papp, Leanna, et al. “The Dark Side of Heterosexual Romance: Endorsement of Romantic Beliefs Relates to Intimate Partner Violence.” Sex Roles, vol. 76, no. 1–2, Jan. 2017, pp. 99–109. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1007/s11199-016-0668-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Female characters as plot devices for male characters ===
====Referred Pain====
In media featuring a male protagonist, women’s pain, suffering, or even death are often used as plot devices to further the male protagonist’s narrative arc. This is known as the “referred pain” plot device. It involves a situation wherien a woman undergoes a traumatic event, often (but not always) of a sexual nature, but her pain is referred to a male character. This male character’s grief and anger due to the trauma experienced by the female character are explored in depth.  The female character’s emotional or physical response is only addressed briefly or cursorily. This trope is featured in such films as [[Mission: Impossible 2|''Mission: Impossible 2'' (2000)]], [[Moulin Rouge!|''Moulin Rouge'' (2001)]], as well as in the Shakespeare play ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' and books like ''[[Oroonoko]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Åström |first1=Berit |title=Referred pain: privileging male emotions in narrative instances of female physical suffering |journal=Journal of Gender Studies |year=2011 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=125-137 |doi=10.1080/09589236.2011.565193 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09589236.2011.565193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

====Disposable Woman====
The Disposable Woman trope refers to a trope in which a woman is included in a story for the sole purpose of dying, thus putting the male protagonist through emotional development or inspiring him to embark on a revenge quest. The woman who dies in these situations is referred to as "disposable" because she does not serve a purpose beyond her death. The disposable woman trope in present in many films, including ''[[Braveheart (1995 film)|Braveheart'' (1995)]], [[The Matrix Revolutions|''The Matrix Revolutions'' (2003)]], ''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy'' (2004)]], ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight'' (2008)]], ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2|The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' (2014)]], ''[[Deadpool 2|Deadpool 2'' (2018)]], and ''[[Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers: Infinity War'' (2018)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disposable Woman |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableWoman |website=TVtropes |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== [[Manic Pixie Dream Girl|The Manic Pixie Dream Girl]] ====
The term “Manic Pixie Dream Girl” was coined in 2007 by film critic Nathan Rabin to describe a female character who exists solely “to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures."&lt;ref name="rabin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/my-year-of-flops-case-file-1-elizabethtown-the-bat,15577/ |title=My Year Of Flops, Case File 1: ''Elizabethtown'': The Bataan Death March of Whimsy |last=Rabin |first=Nathan |authorlink=Nathan Rabin |date=January 25, 2007 |website=[[The A.V.

== Representations of men ==
Men are proportionally represented by media more often compared to women, but the representations that do exist are often criticized for their portrayal of sexist stereotypes. Most critics discuss the ways male characters in film and television are typically more tough, aggressive, domineering, etc than the average man they are meant to represent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gendered Media: The Influence of Media on Views of Gender|last=Wood|first=Julia T.|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text='[[Masculinity|Masculine]]' means the male who fits in with [[Society of the United States|American society]]'s stereotypical 'manly man', or a handsome (according to current [[Culture of the United States|American culture]]) man with definite muscles, and a conservative style of dress and hairdo. The inadequate male lacks many characteristics of the masculine male. He is weak and fearful, lacking both physical stamina and any significant amount of courage. This was demonstrated in the cartoons analyzed not only through actions but also by body type and bone structure, as well as dress and hairstyle. The delicate female was patterned in the cartoons studied as a woman of delicate physical structure, who is thin and dressed in such a manner as would not allow her to complete tasks traditionally meant for males. The modern female is one who is dressed in a more neutral fashion, such as jeans or pants, and does not have a noticeably tiny waistline.|author=Kelly Eick|source="Gender Stereotypes in Children's Television Cartoons"&lt;ref name="Eick"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.calpoly.edu/~jrubba/495/paper1.html|title=Gender Stereotypes in Children's Television Cartoons|website=Dr. Rubba's Home Page: English 495 Topics in Applied Language Study|publisher=California Polytechnic State University|date=April 17, 2008|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}}}

Media representations of sports and athletes contribute to the construction of a dominant model of [[masculinity]] centered on strength and an ambivalent relationship to [[violence]], encouraging boys and men to take risks and to be aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Messner|first1=Michael A.|last2=Dunbar|first2=Michele|last3=Hunt|first3=Darnell|author-link3=Darnell Hunt|date=November 2000|title=The televised sports manhood formula|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0193723500244006|journal=[[Journal of Sport &amp; Social Issues]]|publisher=[[Sage Publications|Sage]]|volume=24|issue=4|pages=380&amp;ndash;394|doi=10.1177/0193723500244006|postscript=.|ref=harv|author-link1=Michael Messner}} [http://www.michaelmessner.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/manhood-formula.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In advertising, men usually promote alcoholic beverages, banking services, credit cards, or cars. Although women also promote cars, advertisements involving women are usually highly dependent on their [[sexuality]], which is not the case for those with men, who are shown in these ads in an elegant and powerful way. Also, when men are acting on a [[Television advertisement|television commercial]], they are usually performing activities such as playing sports, driving around girls, repairing cars, drinking, relaxing, and having fun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Advertising|author=Bartos, R.|publisher=Sage Publications|year=2000|editor=J. Jones|location=US|pp=103–117|chapter=Women as advertising target}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, when a man is promoting on an advertisement, they usually speak about the product and do not use it. They seem to be the [[beneficiary]] of the product or service, typically performed by women.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whipple|first1=T. W.|last2=Courtney|first2=A.

Film historian [[Miriam Hansen]] argues the way [[female gaze]] came to film during the [[flapper]] films of the 1920s, specifically citing the famous Italian-American actor [[Rudolph Valentino]] as having been used on the screen to draw in a female audience as an embodiment of male beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|date=November 10, 2016|title=From a faculty seminar with Laura Mulvey: reflections on visual pleasure|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17400309.2017.1377923?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=New Review of Film and Television Studies|volume=15|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginie Julliard and Nelly Quemener remark that even though the dominant conception of sexuality in media is [[heterosexuality]] with [[construction]] of [[tradition]]al models of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]], sexually diverse versions are being used in media which can also be a source of identification by the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rfsic.revues.org/693|title=Le genre dans la communication et les médias : enjeux et perspectives|author1=Virginie Julliard|author2=Nelly Quemener|date=2014-01-15|accessdate=2015-03-04|journal=Revue française des sciences de l'information et de la communication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, a U.S. [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] [[media monitoring]] organization called [[GLAAD]] was founded by [[Vito Russo]], [[Jewelle Gomez]], and Lauren Hinds with the support of other [[LGBT]] people in the media to combat media discrimination.

Studies have found that exposure to objectifying media can be linked to increased probability of male viewers engaging in sexual harassment, abuse, or acts of violence against women.&lt;ref name="Galdi3" /&gt;

In the U.S., for example, exposure to TV has been associated with "more stereotypical sexual attitudes [like the idea that men are sex-driven and the notion that women are sexual objects] and evaluation styles". Also popular is the idea that appearance or sexiness is essential for men and women.&lt;ref name="Bogt2" /&gt; Additionally, pop music and music videos have been shown to increase stereotypical gender schemas, and promote the ideas that gender relationships are adversarial and that appearance is fundamental.&lt;ref name="Bogt2" /&gt;

The stereotyped portrayals of men and women have been argued to be valued and internalized by younger viewers, especially during puberty and the construction of their sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Raja Mujtaba|date=January 18, 2011|title=Mass media and its influence on society|work=Opinion Maker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Body image ===
There are many studies that aim to prove that sexual objectification is the root cause of body image issues. One 1995 study intended to prove that sexual advertising contributes to body dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinberg|first=Leslie|date=1995|title=Body Image and Televised Images of Thinness and Attractiveness: A Controlled Laboratory Investigation|url=http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.1995.14.4.325|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume=14|pages=325–338|doi=10.1521/jscp.1995.14.4.325|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hundred and thirty nine women were involved. They were split into two groups: The first group where the women watched an advert that showed attractive women. The second part where they showed adverts that were non-appearance related. The results showed the group of women that watched the appearance related advertisement experienced feelings of depression and body dissatisfaction.

Relationships between media exposure and personal concepts of body image have also been increasingly explored. ''[[Psychology Today]]'' conducted a survey and observed that "of 3,452 women who responded to this survey, 23% indicated that movie or television celebrities influenced their body image when they were young, and 22% endorsed the influence of fashion magazine models".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=J.

Factors involved in the composition of self-image include the emotional, physical, and reasoning aspects of a person, and these aspects affect one another.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Legenbauer|first=Tanja|date=May 2008|title=Influence of Appearance-Related TV Commercials on Body Image State|url=|journal=Behavior Modification|volume=32|pages=352–371|doi=10.1177/0145445507309027|pmid=18391052|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main contributors to negative body image is the fact that forms of media like commercials and magazines promotes the "thin ideal".&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; From seeing images of women with extremely thin bodies, some people have an increase of negative emotions, and these individuals tend to take actions like dieting to help relieve the undesirable feelings about their body image.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; This act of dieting could lead to dangerous behaviors such as eating disorders if the negative perceptions about one's body image does not improve.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Considering that an average North American will watch about 35,000 commercials a year, it is to be expected that commercials presenting images of skinny and gorgeous women will have a bigger impact on increasing negative body image, than ads in magazines.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The author of "Influence of Appearance-Related TV Commercials on Body Image State", Tanja Legenbauer, conducted a study in order to demonstrate that images presented in commercials can lead to harmful effects in those that watch them. &amp;nbsp;Her study included participants who looked at different silhouettes of differently shaped women, and their response to these images was reviewed. These participants included those with and without eating disorders, and usually those participants with eating disorders reacted more negatively to the images presented to them in the study.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

One explanation for why TV shows could negatively affect body image is the idea of the "third" person. The "third" person idea explains that women can start to develop negative body image because they are constantly seeing images of thin and beautiful women on TV.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Yoonhyeung|date=October 2008|title=Third-Person Effects of Idealized Body Image in Magazine Advertisements|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=52|pages=147–164|doi=10.1177/0002764208321348|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From seeing these images, they realize that men are seeing these same women and thinking that those images are the standards for a perfect or ideal woman.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; Body image can be defined as the perception of how one sees themselves and whether or not they are happy with what they are seeing. This image of oneself can be positively or negatively affected by the opinions of those that matter to the person.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; When a woman thinks about the "third person", the gender and relationship of the "third person" to the woman can change the amount of impact their opinion has on the woman.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; So, an example would be if a woman knows that her boyfriend is seeing these images of lean and beautiful women, her boyfriend's opinion can more negatively affect how she sees herself and her body than if she thinks about a female stranger seeing the same images.

Eating disorders are presumed to mainly affect teenage girls, but they are starting to become more common in middle aged women. When women want to work on bettering their health or when they want to get into shape, they often look to fitness or health magazines.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Willis|first=Laura E.|date=April 2014|title=Weighing Women Down: Messages on Weight Loss and Body Shaping in Editorial Content in Popular Women's Health and Fitness Magazines|url=|journal=Health Communication|volume=29|pages=323–331|doi=10.1080/10410236.2012.755602|pmid=23844558|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One problem with women looking towards health magazines for help is that these magazines are often filled with images of women who are in their 40s and 50s, but are very lean and beautiful.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; In order to establish that these health magazines are having a negative impact on body image in the readers of the magazines, Laura E. Willis, the author of "Weighing Women Down: Messages on Weight Loss and Body Shaping in Editorial Content in Popular Women's Health", conducted a study. She looked at issues of five different health and fitness magazines, and realized that these magazines tend to focus more on appearance rather than health, and focused on reducing caloric intake rather than exercise.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The messages presented in these magazines can cause a negative perception of oneself, and instead of motivating people to better themselves, they have the ability to make the reader feel bad about their body.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

=== Growing lack of "strong" male characters ===
Some critics have expressed fears of the growing trend of female protagonists with less important male counterparts used for support and comic relief, and specifically the effects this will have on [[Generation Z]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-media-is-redefining-men-and-how-men-are-redefining_us_59b18166e4b0c50640cd657f|title=How Media is Redefining Men and How Men are Redefining Media|last=Myers|first=Jack|date=Nov 7, 2017|work=Huffington Post|access-date=March 27, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responses and movements for change ==
=== Feminist response ===
[[Germaine Greer]], Australian-born author of [[The Female Eunuch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Female-Eunuch-Germaine-Greer/dp/006157953X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458435668&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+female+eunuch+by+germaine+greer|title=The Female Eunuch|last1=Greer|first1=Germaine|date=1970|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|isbn=978-0061579530}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1970), offered a systematic deconstruction of ideas such as womanhood and femininity, arguing that women are forced to assume submissive roles in society to fulfill male fantasies of what being a woman entails.  Greer wrote that women were perceived as mere consumers benefiting from the purchasing power of their husband. Women become targets for marketing, she said, and their image is used in advertising to sell products.  American socialist writer and feminist, [[Sharon Smith (writer)|Sharon Smith]] wrote on the first issue of ''Women and Film'' that women's roles in film "almost always [revolve] around her physical attraction and the mating games she plays with the male characters" in contrast to men's roles, which according to the author are more varied.&lt;ref name="Smith2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Sharon|title=The Image of Women in Film: Some Suggestions for Future Research|journal=Women and Film|issue=1|pages=13–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 Marjorie Rosen, an important contributor to [[feminist film theory]], argued that "the Cinema Woman is a Popcorn Venus, a delectable but insubstantial hybrid of cultural distortions".&lt;ref name="Rosen2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Popcorn Venus|last1=Rosen|first1=Marjorie|date=1973|publisher=Avon Books|location=New York|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 Gaye Tuchman wrote of the concept of [[symbolic annihilation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hearth and Home: Images of Women in the Mass Media|last1=Tuchman|first1=Gaye|last2=Kaplan Daniels|first2=Arlene|last3=Benét|first3=James|date=1978|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195023527|ref=Tuchman}}&lt;/ref&gt; blaming the media for imposing a negative vision of active women and making an apologia for housewives.

From media representations, feminists paved the way for debates and discussions about gender within the social and political spheres. In 1986, the British MP Clare Short proposed a bill to ban newspapers from printing [[Page 3]] photographs of topless models.&lt;ref name="Biscarrat2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rfsic.revues.org/619|title=L'analyse des médias au prisme du genre : formation d'une épistémè|author=Laetitia Biscarrat|date=2013|accessdate=2015-03-04|journal=Revue française des sciences de l'information et de la communication|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/clare-short-i-didnt-get-rid-of-page-3-can-leveson-6294455.html|title=I didn't get rid of Page 3 &amp;ndash; Can Levenson?|author=Clare Short|accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, feminist critics began analyzing film in terms of the Bechdel test. This feminist assessment of cinema was named after [[Alison Bechdel]], feminist cartoonist and creator of the long-running comic strip ''[[Dykes to Watch Out For]]''. This test determines the level of gender equality present in a film by assessing whether a work of&amp;nbsp;[[fiction]]&amp;nbsp;features at least two named women who talk to each other about something other than a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bechdeltest.com/|title=Bechdel Test Movie List|website=bechdeltest.com|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, TV critics, academics, and women started to point out the way TV shows portrayed female characters.&lt;ref name="Zeisler3"/&gt; ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine called out the industry for "refusing to rise above characterizations of women as pretty, skinny, dopey, hapless housewives or housewife wannabes", and a poll conducted by ''[[Redbook]]'' magazine in 1972 showed that "75 per cent of 120,000 women ... agreed that 'the media degrades women by portraying them as mindless dolls'".&lt;ref name="Zeisler3" /&gt; In that sense, ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' was a television breakthrough because it introduced the first female character whose central relationships were not her husband or boyfriend or her family, but her friends and coworkers. The main character was a sort of stand-in for the "new American female" who put her job before romance and preferred to be alone than with the wrong men, but still had to do stereotypically female office work (like typing and getting coffee) and didn't speak up to her boss and other male coworkers.&lt;ref name="Zeisler3" /&gt;

=== International Organization and NGO response ===
==== UN Women ====
[[UN Women]] is the [[United Nations|UN]] organization dedicated to [[gender equality]] and the [[empowerment]] of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/about-us/about-un-women|title=About UN Women|work=UN Women|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to increase women's leadership, to end violence against women and to engage women in all aspects of peace and security processes, it's important to give women the right place in media landscape, and their representations must be fair and equal. UN Women supports media monitoring studies on how women are depicted in the media. For instance, the organisation "engage media professionals by raising awareness of gender equality and violence against women, including through special workshops and tool-kits, to encourage gender-sensitive reporting."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/end-violence-against-women/2014/media|title=Women and media|work=UN Women|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== UNESCO ====
In line with UNESCO's [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/themes/gender-equality/ Global Priority Gender], "[[UNESCO]] is contributing to achieving full [[gender equality]] in the media by 2030".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/media-pluralism-and-gender-equality|title=Media Diversity and Gender Equality|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reach this goal, the Organization developed the [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/crosscutting-priorities/gender-and-media/gender-sensitive-indicators-for-media/ Gender-sensitive Indicators for Media (GSIM)] to measure gender awareness and portrayal within media organizations (e.g. working conditions), but particularly in editorial content. The Organization has been promoting their application by governments, media organizations, journalists unions and associations, journalism schools and the like. They set the basis for gender equality in media operations and editorial content. In addition, each year, UNESCO organizes a campaign named "[https://en.unesco.org/womenmakenews Women Make the News]"; in 2018 the theme was ''Gender Equality and Sports Media'' as "Sports coverage is hugely powerful in shaping norms and [[stereotype]]s about [[gender]]. Media has the ability to challenge these norms, promoting a balanced coverage of men's and women's sports and a fair portrayal of sportspeople irrespective of gender."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/womenmakenews|title=Women Make the News 2018|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Geena Davis Institute ====
The [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media|Geena Davis Institute]] advocates for gender equality in media. It is a NGO specialized in researches on gender representation in media. It advocates for equal representation of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-12|title=Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geena_Davis_Institute_on_Gender_in_Media&amp;oldid=830135727|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to increase women's leadership, to end violence against women and to engage women in all aspects of peace and security processes

[[File:BattleofSluys.jpeg|thumb|Melee aboard ships at the [[Battle of Sluys]] 1340 (BNF Fr. 2643, 15th century)]]
[[File:Battle of Lutzen.jpg|thumb|''[[Battle of Lutzen (1632)|Battle of Lützen]]'' by  [[Carl Wahlbom]] depicting a melee in which King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] was killed on 16 November 1632.]]
'''Melee''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|eɪ|l|eɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|l|eɪ}}, French: '''mêlée''' {{IPA-fr|mɛle|}}) or '''pell-mell''' battle  generally refers to disorganized [[close combat]] in battles fought at abnormally close range with little central control once it starts.{{sfn|OED|2015}}

In the 1579 translation of [[Plutarch]]'s ''Lives of the noble Grecians and Romanes'', [[Sir Thomas North]] uses the term 'pelmel' to refer to a disorganized retreat.&lt;ref name="phrases"&gt;https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/pell-mell.html&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was later used in its current spelling in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', 1594:

{{Quote
|text= "March on, ioine brauelie, let vs to it pell mell, If not to heauen then hand in hand to hell."
}}

The phrase comes from the French expression ''pêle-mêle'', a rhyme based on the old French ''mesler'', meaning to mix or mingle. 
&lt;ref name="phrases" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pell-mell&lt;/ref&gt;

The French term ''melee'' was first used in English in c. 1640 (also derived from the old French ''mesler'',&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/melee#English&lt;/ref&gt;  but the Old French stem survives in ''[[:wikt:medley|medley]]'' and ''[[:wikt:meddle|meddle]]'').{{sfn|OED|2015}}

In military aviation, a melee has been described as "[a]n air battle in which several aircraft, both friend and foe, are confusingly intermingled".{{sfn|Kumar|DeRemer|Marshall|2004|p=462}}

[[Lord Nelson]] described his tactics for the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] as inducing a "pell mell battle" focused on engagements between individual ships where the superior morale and skill of the [[Royal Navy]] would prevail.{{sfn|Fremont-Barnes|2005|p=38}}

The [[destroyer]] night action of the second [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] on 13 November 1942, was so utterly chaotic and the ships were so intermingled that an officer on {{USS|Monssen|DD-436|6}} later likened it to "a barroom brawl after the lights had been shot out".&lt;ref name="guadalcanal441"&gt;Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Descartes mind and body.gif|thumb|200px|right|[[René Descartes]]' illustration of [[mind/body dualism]].

Descartes believed inputs are passed on by the sensory organs to the [[Pineal gland|epiphysis]] in the brain and from there to the immaterial spirit.&lt;ref name="Descartes1641"&gt;Descartes, R. (1641) ''Meditations on First Philosophy'', in ''The Philosophical Writings of René Descartes'', trans. by J. Cottingham, R. Stoothoff and D.

The '''mind''' is a set of [[cognition|cognitive]] faculties including [[consciousness]], [[perception]], [[thought|thinking]], [[judgement]], [[language]] and [[memory]]. It is usually defined as the faculty of an entity's thoughts and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mind|title=mind – definition of mind in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds the power of imagination, recognition, and appreciation, and is responsible for processing feelings and emotions, resulting in attitudes and actions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

There is a lengthy tradition in [[philosophy of mind|philosophy]], [[religion]], [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]] about what constitutes a mind and what are its distinguishing properties.

One open question regarding the nature of the mind is the [[mind–body problem]], which investigates the relation of the mind to the physical [[brain]] and nervous system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Older viewpoints included [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and [[idealism]], which considered the mind somehow non-physical.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mindware|last=Clark|first=Andy|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-982815-9|location=198 Madison Avenue, New York, 10016|pages=14, 254–256|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern views often center around [[physicalism]] and [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], which hold that the mind is roughly identical with the brain or [[Reductionism|reducible]] to physical phenomena such as [[neuron|neuronal activity]]&lt;ref&gt;Smart, J.J.C., "The Mind/Brain Identity Theory", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/mind-identity/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2016}}, though dualism and idealism continue to have many supporters. Another question concerns which types of [[being]]s are capable of having minds (New Scientist 8 September 2018 p10).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} For example, whether mind is exclusive to humans, possessed also by some or all [[animals]], by all [[life|living things]], whether it is a strictly definable characteristic at all, or whether mind can also be a property of some types of [[artificial intelligence|human-made machines]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Whatever its nature, it is generally agreed that mind is that which enables a being to have [[subjectivity|subjective]] [[awareness]] and [[intentionality]] towards their environment, to [[perceive]] and respond to [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] with some kind of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], and to have consciousness, including thinking and [[feeling]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The concept of mind is understood in many different ways by many different cultural and religious traditions. Some see mind as a property exclusive to humans whereas others ascribe properties of mind to non-living entities (e.g. [[panpsychism]] and [[animism]]), to animals and to [[deity|deities]]. Some of the earliest recorded speculations linked mind (sometimes described as identical with [[soul]] or [[spirit]]) to theories concerning both [[life after death]], and [[cosmology|cosmological]] and [[Nature (philosophy)|natural]] order, for example in the doctrines of [[Zoroaster]], [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], Plato, [[Aristotle]], and other ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek]], [[Indian philosophy|Indian]] and, later, [[Islamic psychological thought|Islamic]] and medieval European philosophers.

Important philosophers of mind include [[Plato]], [[Patanjali]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Kant]], [[Hegel]], [[Schopenhauer]], [[John Searle|Searle]], [[Daniel Dennett|Dennett]], [[Jerry Fodor|Fodor]], [[Thomas Nagel|Nagel]], and [[David Chalmers|Chalmers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2016/01/20-most-important-philosophers-of-mind-since-wwii.html | title=20 "Most Important" Philosophers of Mind since WWII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists such as [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and [[William James|James]], and [[computer science|computer scientists]] such as [[Alan Turing|Turing]] and [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]] developed influential theories about the nature of the mind. The possibility of nonbiological minds is explored in the field of [[artificial intelligence]], which works closely in relation with [[cybernetics]] and [[information theory]] to understand the ways in which information processing by nonbiological machines is comparable or different to mental phenomena in the human mind.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Etymology==
The original meaning of [[Old English]] ''[[:wikt:gemynd|gemynd]]'' was the faculty of [[memory]], not of thought in general.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Hence ''call to mind'', ''come to mind'', ''keep in mind'', ''to have mind of'', etc. The word retains this sense in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mind|title=mind – definition of mind in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old English]] had other words to express "mind", such as ''[[:wikt:hyge|hyge]]'' "mind, spirit".{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The meaning of "memory" is shared with [[Old Norse]], which has ''[[Muninn|munr]]''. The word is originally from a [[PIE]] verbal root ''{{PIE|*men-}}'', meaning "to think, remember", whence also Latin'' [[:wikt:mens#Latin|mens]]'' "mind", Sanskrit ''[[:wikt:मनस्|{{IAST|manas}}]]'' "mind" and Greek [[:wikt:μένος|μένος]] "mind, courage, anger".

The generalization of ''mind'' to include all mental faculties, thought, [[Volition (psychology)|volition]], feeling and memory, gradually develops over the 14th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mind|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The attributes that make up the mind are debated. Some psychologists argue that only the "higher" intellectual functions constitute mind, particularly reason and [[memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Başar|first1=Erol|title=Brain body mind oscillations in scope of uncertainty principle|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1441961365|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NAbMHo-ux58C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=Some+psychologists+argue+that+only+the+%22higher%22+intellectual+functions+constitute+mind,+particularly+reason+and+memory#v=onepage&amp;q=Some%20psychologists%20argue%20that%20only%20the%20%22higher%22%20intellectual%20functions%20constitute%20mind%2C%20particularly%20reason%20and%20memory&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view the emotions — [[love]], [[hate]], [[fear]], and [[joy]] — are more ''primitive ''or subjective in nature and should be seen as different from the mind as such. Others argue that various rational and emotional states cannot be so separated, that they are of the same nature and origin, and should therefore be considered all part of it as mind.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In popular usage, ''mind ''is frequently synonymous with ''thought'': the private conversation with ourselves that we carry on "inside our heads."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Israel|first1=Richard|last2=North|first2=Vanda|title=Mind Chi Re-wire Your Brain in 8 Minutes a Day ; Strategies for Success in Business and Life|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester|isbn=978-1907321375|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VCP63CWtVqIC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=mind+is+frequently+synonymous+with+thought:#v=onepage&amp;q=mind%20is%20frequently%20synonymous%20with%20thought%3A&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus we "make up our minds," "change our minds" or are "of two minds" about something. One of the key attributes of the mind in this sense is that it is a private sphere to which no one but the owner has access. No one else can "know our mind." They can only interpret what we consciously or unconsciously communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Masters|first1=Frances|title=Harness your Amazingly Creative Mind|url=http://www.thefusionmodel.com/harness-amazingly-creative-mind/|website=www.thefusionmodel.com|accessdate=18 April 2015|date=2014-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental faculties==
{{See also|Nous|Reason|Modularity of mind|Mental process}}

Broadly speaking, mental faculties are the various functions of the mind, or things the mind can "do".

[[Thought]] is a mental act that allows humans to make sense of things in the world, and to represent and interpret them in ways that are significant, or which accord with their needs, attachments, goals, commitments, plans, ends, desires, etc. Thinking involves the [[symbol]]ic or [[semiotic]] mediation of [[idea]]s or data, as when we form [[concept]]s, engage in [[problem solving]], reasoning, and making [[choice|decisions]]. Words that refer to similar concepts and processes include [[deliberation]], [[cognition]], [[idea]]tion, [[discourse]] and [[imagination]].

Thinking is sometimes described as a "higher" [[cognitive]] function and the analysis of thinking processes is a part of [[cognitive psychology]]. It is also deeply connected with our capacity to make and use [[tools]]; to understand [[causality|cause and effect]]; to recognize patterns of significance; to comprehend and [[world disclosure|disclose]] unique contexts of experience or activity; and to respond to the world in a meaningful way.

[[Memory]] is the ability to preserve, retain, and subsequently recall, knowledge, information or experience. Although memory has traditionally been a persistent theme in [[philosophy]], the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also saw the study of memory emerge as a subject of inquiry within the paradigms of [[cognitive psychology]]. In recent decades, it has become one of the pillars of a new branch of science called [[cognitive neuroscience]], a marriage between cognitive psychology and [[neuroscience]].

[[Imagination]] is the activity of generating or evoking novel situations, [[image]]s, ideas or other [[qualia]] in the mind. It is a characteristically [[Subjectivity|subjective]] ''activity'', rather than a direct or passive experience. The term is technically used in [[psychology]] for the process of reviving in the mind [[perception|percepts]] of objects formerly given in sense perception. Since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary [[language]], some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as "[[wikt:Imaging|imaging]]" or "[[wikt:Imagery|imagery]]" or to speak of it as "reproductive" as opposed to "productive" or "constructive" imagination. Things imagined are said to be seen in the "[[mind's eye]]". Among the many practical functions of imagination are the ability to project possible futures (or histories), to "see" things from another's perspective, and to change the way something is perceived, including to make decisions to respond to, or enact, what is imagined.

[[Consciousness]] in mammals (this includes humans) is an aspect of the mind generally thought to comprise qualities such as [[subjectivity]], [[sentience]], and the ability to [[perception|perceive]] the relationship between [[Personal identity|oneself]] and one's [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. It is a subject of much research in [[philosophy of mind]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive science]]. Some philosophers divide consciousness into [[phenomena]]l consciousness, which is subjective experience itself, and access consciousness, which refers to the global availability of information to processing systems in the brain.&lt;ref name="Bl"&gt;Ned Block: "On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness" in: ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Phenomenal consciousness has many different experienced qualities, often referred to as [[qualia]]. Phenomenal consciousness is usually consciousness ''of'' something or ''about'' something, a property known as [[intentionality]] in philosophy of mind.

==Mental content==
Mental contents are those items that are thought of as being "in" the mind, and capable of being formed and manipulated by mental processes and faculties. Examples include [[thought]]s, [[concept]]s, [[memories]], [[emotion]]s, [[percept]]s and [[intention]]s. Philosophical theories of mental content include [[internalism]], [[externalism]], [[direct and indirect realism|representationalism]] and [[intentionality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/content-narrow/ | title=Narrow Mental Content | publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memetics===
[[Memetics]] is a theory of mental content based on an analogy with [[Darwinian evolution]], which was originated by [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in the 1980s. It is an [[evolutionary model]] of cultural [[information transfer]]. A [[meme]], analogous to a [[gene]], is an idea, belief, pattern of behaviour (etc.) "hosted" in one or more individual minds, and can reproduce itself from mind to mind. Thus what would otherwise be regarded as one individual influencing another to adopt a belief, is seen memetically as a meme reproducing itself.

==Relation to the brain==
{{See also|Cognitive neuroscience}}

In animals, the [[brain]], or ''encephalon'' ([[Greek (language)|Greek]] for "in the head"), is the control center of the [[central nervous system]], responsible for [[thought]]. In most animals, the brain is located in the head, protected by the [[skull]] and close to the primary sensory apparatus of [[Visual perception|vision]], [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[equilibrioception]], [[taste]] and [[olfaction]]. While all [[vertebrate]]s have a brain, most [[invertebrate]]s have either a centralized brain or collections of individual [[ganglion|ganglia]]. Primitive animals such as [[sponge]]s do not have a brain at all. Brains can be extremely complex. For example, the [[human brain]] contains around 86 billion [[neuron]]s, each linked to as many as 10,000 others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whishaw|first=Bryan Kolb, Ian Q.|title=An Introduction to Brain and Behavior|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7167-7691-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIBEEP2b1MIC|edition=3rd |accessdate=11 May 2012|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherwood|first=Lauralee|title=Fundamentals of Human Physiology|year=2011|publisher=Brooks/Cole Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-8400-6225-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jl4rLDuewo4C|edition=4th |accessdate=11 May 2012|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding the relationship between the brain and the mind&amp;nbsp;– [[mind–body problem]] is one of the central issues in the history of [[philosophy]]&amp;nbsp;– is a challenging problem both philosophically and scientifically.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Smith Churchland, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hAeFMFW3rDUC ''Neurophilosophy: toward a unified science of the mind-brain''], MIT Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; There are three major philosophical schools of thought concerning the answer: dualism, materialism, and idealism. [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]] holds that the mind exists independently of the brain;&lt;ref&gt;Hart, W.D. (1997): [https://books.google.com/books?id=GFtVBGAn5-YC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;dq=dualism+%22The+mind-body+problem+is+the+question+how+the+mind+is+attached+to+the+body%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VKuFTtvlNYSN4gTVrf20Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dualism%20%22The%20mind-body%20problem%20is%20the%20question%20how%20the%20mind%20is%20attached%20to%20the%20body%22&amp;f=false ‘Dualism’, pp. 265–267] in S. Guttenplan (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GFtVBGAn5-YC ''A Companion to the Philosophy of Mind''], Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; [[materialism]] holds that mental phenomena are identical to neuronal phenomena;&lt;ref name="DicPhil"&gt;A.R. Lacey, ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and [[idealism (philosophy)|idealism]] holds that only mental phenomena exist.&lt;ref name="DicPhil"/&gt;

Through most of history many philosophers found it inconceivable that cognition could be implemented by a physical substance such as brain tissue (that is neurons and synapses).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChurchland|''Neurophilosophy'']], Ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Descartes]], who thought extensively about mind-brain relationships, found it possible to explain reflexes and other simple behaviors in [[The Description of the Human Body|mechanistic terms]], although he did not believe that complex thought, and language in particular, could be explained by reference to the physical brain alone.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDescartes|Descartes, ''Description of the human body'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most straightforward scientific evidence of a strong relationship between the physical brain [[matter]] and the mind is the impact physical alterations to the brain have on the mind, such as with [[traumatic brain injury]] and [[psychoactive drug]] use.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBoake|Boake and Diller, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Patricia Churchland]] notes that this drug-mind interaction indicates an intimate connection between the brain and the mind.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChurchland|''Neurophilosophy'']], Ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the philosophical questions, the relationship between mind and brain involves a number of scientific questions, including understanding the relationship between mental activity and brain activity, the exact mechanisms by which drugs influence [[cognition]], and the [[neural correlates of consciousness]].

Theoretical approaches to explain how mind emerges from the brain include [[connectionism]], [[computationalism]] and [[Bayesian brain]].

==Evolutionary history of the human mind==
The [[evolution of human intelligence]] refers to several theories that aim to describe how human [[intelligence]] has [[evolution|evolved]] in relation to the evolution of the [[human brain]] and the [[origin of language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harnad, S.R., Steklis, H.D., &amp; Lancaster, J.E.|title=Origins and evolution of language and speech|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=280|issue=1|pages=1–2|date=1976|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1976.tb25462.x|bibcode=1976NYASA.280....1H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The timeline of [[human evolution]] spans some 7 million years, from the separation of the genus ''[[Chimpanzee|Pan]]'' until the emergence of [[behavioral modernity]] by 50,000 years ago. Of this timeline, the first 3 million years concern ''[[Sahelanthropus tchadensis|Sahelanthropus]]'', the following 2 million concern ''[[Australopithecus]]'', while the final 2 million span the history of actual ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' species (the [[Paleolithic]]).

Many traits of human intelligence, such as [[empathy]], [[theory of mind]], [[mourning]], [[ritual]], and the use of [[Great ape language|symbols]] and [[tool]]s, are already apparent in [[great ape]]s although in lesser sophistication than in humans.

There is a debate between supporters of the idea of a sudden emergence of intelligence, or "[[Behavioural modernity#Great leap forward|Great leap forward]]" and those of a gradual or [[Behavioural modernity#Continuum hypothesis|continuum hypothesis]].

Theories of the evolution of intelligence include:
* [[Robin Dunbar]]'s social brain hypothesis&lt;ref name="The Social Brain Hypothesis"&gt;[http://www.liv.ac.uk/evolpsyc/Evol_Anthrop_6.pdfThe Social Brain Hypothesis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713121559/http://www.liv.ac.uk/evolpsyc/Evol_Anthrop_6.pdfThe |date=2015-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]]'s [[sexual selection]] hypothesis concerning [[Sexual selection in human evolution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|authorlink=Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|title=The Mating Mind|isbn=978-0-8058-5749-8|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ecological dominance-social competition (EDSC)&lt;ref name=flinn&gt;{{cite web| url=http://web.missouri.edu/~gearyd/Flinnetal2005.pdf|title=Flinn, M.V., Geary, D.C., &amp; Ward, C.V. (2005).

Geary and Carol V. Ward based mainly on work by [[Richard D. Alexander]].
* The idea of intelligence as a signal of good health and resistance to disease.
* The [[Group selection]] theory contends that organism characteristics that provide benefits to a group (clan, tribe, or larger population) can evolve despite individual disadvantages such as those cited above.
* The idea that intelligence is connected with nutrition, and thereby with status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306987704000416 |title= Enhanced nutrition of offspring as a crucial factor for the evolution of intelligence on land |website= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A higher IQ could be a signal that an individual comes from and lives in a physical and social environment where nutrition levels are high, and vice versa.

==Philosophy of mind==
{{Main|Philosophy of mind}}

Philosophy of mind is the branch of [[philosophy]] that studies the nature of the mind, [[mental event]]s, [[mental function]]s, [[mental property|mental properties]], [[consciousness]] and their relationship to the physical body. The ''[[mind–body problem]]'', i.e. the relationship of the mind to the body, is commonly seen as the central issue in philosophy of mind, although there are other issues concerning the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the physical body.&lt;ref name="Kim1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kim | first = J. | editor = Honderich, Ted | title = Problems in the Philosophy of Mind.

''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. Ted Honderich (ed.) Oxford:Oxford University Press. 1998.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Manuel Rodriguez Delgado]] writes, "In present popular usage, soul and mind are not clearly differentiated and some people, more or less consciously, still feel that the soul, and perhaps the mind, may enter or leave the body as independent entities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=James M.R. Delgado | title= Physical control of the mind; towards a psycho civilized society | page=25 | year=1969 | publisher=Fitzhenry &amp; Whiteside Limited | location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]]'' and ''[[monism]]'' are the two major schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind–body problem. Dualism is the position that mind and body are in some way separate from each other. It can be traced back to [[Plato]],&lt;ref name="Plato"&gt;{{cite book  | author = Plato |editor1=E.A.

(1996) "Dualism", in Samuel Guttenplan (org) ''A Companion to the Philosophy of Mind'', Blackwell, Oxford, 265–267.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th century philosopher Martin Heidegger suggested that subjective experience and activity (i.e. the "mind") cannot be made sense of in terms of [[Descartes|Cartesian]] "substances" that bear "properties" at all (whether the mind itself is thought of as a distinct, separate kind of substance or not). This is because the nature of subjective, ''qualitative'' experience is incoherent in terms of&amp;nbsp;– or semantically [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]] with the concept of&amp;nbsp;– substances that bear properties. This is a fundamentally [[ontology|ontological]] argument.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus, "Critique of Descartes I" (recorded lecture), University of California at Berkeley, September 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher of [[cognitive science]] [[Daniel Dennett]], for example, argues there is no such thing as a narrative center called the "mind", but that instead there is simply a collection of sensory inputs and outputs: different kinds of "software" running in parallel.&lt;ref name=Dennett1991&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel |title=Consciousness Explained |year=1991 |publisher=Little Brown |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-316-18065-8|title-link=Consciousness Explained }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--find page # or page range for this citation--&gt; Psychologist [[B.F. Skinner]] argued that the mind is an explanatory fiction that diverts attention from environmental causes of behavior;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. About Behaviorism 1974, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; he considered the mind a "black box" and thought that mental processes may be better conceived of as forms of covert verbal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. ''About Behaviorism'', Chapter 7: Thinking&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A thesis against which [[Noam Chomsky#Contributions to psychology|Noam Chomsky]] advanced a considerable polemic.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[David Chalmers]] has argued that the third person approach to uncovering mind and consciousness is not effective, such as looking into other's brains or observing human conduct, but that a first person approach is necessary.   Such a first person perspective indicates that the mind must be conceptualized as something distinct from the brain.

The mind has also been described as manifesting from moment to moment, one thought moment at a time as a fast flowing stream, where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;

===Mind/body perspectives===
''Monism'' is the position that mind and body are not [[physiology|physiologically]] and ontologically distinct kinds of entities. This view was first advocated in [[Western Philosophy]] by [[Parmenides]] in the 5th Century BC and was later espoused by the 17th Century [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[Baruch Spinoza]].&lt;ref name="Spin"&gt;Spinoza, Baruch (1670) ''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus'' (A Theologico-Political Treatise).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Spinoza's [[dual-aspect theory]], mind and body are two aspects of an underlying reality which he variously described as "Nature" or "God".
* ''[[Physicalism|Physicalists]]'' argue that only the entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that the mind will eventually be explained in terms of these entities as physical theory continues to evolve.
* ''[[idealism (philosophy)|Idealists]]'' maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind.
* ''[[neutral monism|Neutral monists]]'' adhere to the position that perceived things in the world can be regarded as either physical or mental depending on whether one is interested in their relationship to other things in the world or their relationship to the perceiver. For example, a red spot on a wall is physical in its dependence on the wall and the pigment of which it is made, but it is mental in so far as its perceived redness depends on the workings of the visual system. Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects.

The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include [[behaviorism]], the [[type physicalism|type identity theory]], [[anomalous monism]] and [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;Kim, J., "Mind-Body Problem", ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. Ted Honderich (ed.). Oxford:Oxford University Press. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern philosophers of mind adopt either a ''reductive'' or ''non-reductive physicalist'' position, maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the body.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, e.g. in the fields of [[sociobiology]], [[computer science]], [[evolutionary psychology]] and the various [[neuroscience]]s.&lt;ref name="PsyBio"&gt;Pinel, J.

===Neuroscience===
{{See also|Cognitive neuroscience|Thought identification}}

[[Neuroscience]] studies the [[nervous system]], the physical basis of the mind. At the systems level, neuroscientists investigate how [[biological neural networks]] form and physiologically interact to produce mental functions and content such as [[reflex]]es, [[multisensory integration]], [[motor coordination]], [[circadian rhythm]]s, [[emotion|emotional responses]], [[learning]], and [[memory]]. At a larger scale, efforts in [[computational neuroscience]] have developed large-scale models that simulate simple, functioning brains.&lt;ref name="Spaun"/&gt; As of 2012, such models include the [[thalamus]], [[basal ganglia]], [[prefrontal cortex]], [[motor cortex]], and [[occipital cortex]], and consequentially simulated brains can learn, respond to visual stimuli, coordinate motor responses, form short-term memories, and learn to respond to patterns. Currently, researchers aim to program the [[hippocampus]] and [[limbic system]], hypothetically imbuing the simulated mind with [[long-term memory]] and crude [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref name="CNRG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Computational Neuroscience Research Group|url=http://ctnsrv.uwaterloo.ca/cnrglab/|publisher=Waterloo Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[affective neuroscience]] studies the neural mechanisms of [[personality psychology|personality]], [[emotion]], and [[mood (psychology)|mood]] primarily through experimental tasks.

===Cognitive Science===
{{See also|Cognitive Science}}
{{expand section|date=May 2013}}

[[Cognitive science]] examines the mental functions that give rise to [[information processing]], termed [[cognition]]. These include [[perception]], [[attention]], [[working memory]], [[long-term memory]], producing and understanding [[language]], [[learning]], [[reason]]ing, [[problem solving]], and [[decision making]]. Cognitive science seeks to understand thinking "in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures".&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;Thagard, Paul, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/cognitive-science/ Cognitive Science], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
{{See also|Neuropsychology|Psyche (psychology)|label 2=Psyche|Unconscious mind}}

[[Psychology]] is the scientific study of human behavior, mental functioning, and experience. As both an [[academic]] and [[applied science|applied]] discipline, Psychology involves the [[science|scientific study]] of [[mental process]]es such as [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[emotion]], [[Personality psychology|personality]], as well as environmental influences, such as social and cultural influences, and [[interpersonal relationships]], in order to devise theories of human behavior. Psychological patterns can be understood as low cost ways of information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Unity of Science and Economics: A New Foundation of Economic Theory|last = Chen|first = Jing|publisher = Springer|year = 2015|isbn = |location = https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493934645}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychology also refers to the application of such [[knowledge]] to various spheres of [[Human behavior|human activity]], including problems of individuals' [[everyday life|daily lives]] and the treatment of [[mental health]] problems.

Psychology differs from the other [[social sciences]] (e.g. [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]]) due to its focus on [[experimentation]] at the scale of the individual, or individuals in small groups as opposed to [[group (sociology)|large groups]], [[institutions]] or [[societies]]. Historically, psychology differed from [[biology]] and [[neuroscience]] in that it was primarily concerned with mind rather than brain. Modern psychological science incorporates [[Psychophysiology|physiological]] and [[neuropsychology|neurological]] processes into its conceptions of [[perception]], [[cognition]], behaviour, and [[mental disorders]].

==Mental health==
{{Main|Mental health}}

By analogy with the health of the body, one can speak metaphorically of a state of health of the mind, or [[mental health]]. [[Merriam-Webster]] defines mental health as "A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her cognitive and emotional capabilities, function in society, and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life." According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), there is no one "official" definition of mental health. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how "mental health" is defined. In general, most experts agree that "mental health" and "[[mental disorder]]" are not opposites. In other words, the absence of a recognized mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health.

One way to think about mental health is by looking at how effectively and successfully a person functions. Feeling capable and competent; being able to handle normal levels of stress, maintaining satisfying relationships, and leading an independent life; and being able to "bounce back," or recover from difficult situations, are all signs of mental health.

[[Psychotherapy]] is an [[interpersonal]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relational]] intervention used by trained psychotherapists to aid [[wikt:Client|clients]] in problems of living. This usually includes increasing individual sense of [[well-being]] and reducing subjective discomforting experience. Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building, [[dialogue]], [[communication]] and [[behavior]] change and that are designed to improve the [[mental health]] of a client or patient, or to improve group relationships (such as in a [[family]]). Most forms of psychotherapy use only spoken [[conversation]], though some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, [[art]], [[drama]], [[narrative]] story, or therapeutic touch. Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained [[therapist]] and client(s). Purposeful, theoretically based psychotherapy began in the 19th century with [[psychoanalysis]]; since then, scores of other approaches have been developed and continue to be created.

==Non-human minds==

===Animal intelligence===
[[Animal cognition]], or cognitive ethology, is the title given to a modern approach to the mental capacities of animals. It has developed out of [[comparative psychology]], but has also been strongly influenced by the approach of [[ethology]], [[behavioral ecology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]]. Much of what used to be considered under the title of "animal intelligence" is now thought of under this heading. [[Animal language acquisition]], attempting to discern or understand the degree to which animal cognition can be revealed by [[linguistics]]-related study, has been controversial among [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive linguists]].

===Artificial intelligence===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2007}}
{{Main|Philosophy of artificial intelligence}}

[[File:Forest of synthetic pyramidal dendrites grown using Cajal's laws of neuronal branching.png|thumb|[[Computer simulation]] of the branching architecture of the [[dendrite]]s of [[pyramidal neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/image.pcbi.v06.i08 | title = PLoS Computational Biology Issue Image &amp;#124; Vol. 6(8) August 2010 | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = ev06.ei08 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;]] In 1950 [[Alan M. Turing]] published "Computing machinery and intelligence" in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', in which he proposed that machines could be tested for intelligence using questions and answers. This process is now named the [[Turing Test]]. The term [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) was first used by [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] who considered it to mean "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines".&lt;ref&gt;What is Artificial Intelligence? by John McCarthy [http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/whatisai.html Stanford University] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118212402/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/whatisai.html |date=2015-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer to [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] as exhibited by an artificial (''man-made'', ''non-natural'', ''manufactured'') entity. AI is studied in overlapping fields of [[computer science]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]] and [[engineering]], dealing with intelligent [[behavior]], [[learn]]ing and [[adaptation]] and usually developed using customized [[machine]]s or [[computer]]s.

Research in AI is concerned with producing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior. Examples include [[control system|control]], [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning and scheduling]], the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions, [[handwriting recognition|handwriting]], [[natural language]], [[speech recognition|speech]] and [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]]. As such, the study of AI has also become an engineering discipline, focused on providing solutions to real life problems, [[knowledge mining]], [[software]] applications, [[strategy games]] like [[computer chess]] and other [[video game]]s. One of the biggest limitations of AI is in the domain of actual machine comprehension. Consequentially [[natural language understanding]] and [[connectionism]] (where behavior of neural networks is investigated) are areas of active research and development.

The debate about the nature of the mind is relevant to the development of [[artificial intelligence]]. If the mind is indeed a thing separate from or higher than the functioning of the brain, then hypothetically it would be much more difficult to recreate within a machine, if it were possible at all. If, on the other hand, the mind is no more than the aggregated functions of the brain, then it will be possible to create a machine with a recognisable mind (though possibly only with computers much different from today's), by simple virtue of the fact that such a machine already exists in the form of the human brain.

==In religion==
Many religions associate spiritual qualities to the human mind. These are often tightly connected to their [[mythology]] and ideas of [[afterlife]].

The [[India]]n [[philosopher]]-sage [[Sri Aurobindo]] attempted to unite the Eastern and Western psychological traditions with his [[integral psychology (Sri Aurobindo)|integral psychology]], as have many philosophers and [[New religious movement]]s. [[Judaism]] teaches that "moach shalit al halev", the mind rules the heart. Humans can approach the Divine intellectually, through learning and behaving according to the Divine Will as enclothed in the Torah, and use that deep logical understanding to elicit and guide emotional arousal during prayer. [[Christianity]] has tended to see the mind as distinct from the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Greek ''[[nous]]'') and sometimes further distinguished from the [[spirit]]. [[Esotericism|Western esoteric traditions]] sometimes refer to a [[mental body]] that exists on a plane other than the physical. [[Hinduism]]'s various philosophical schools have debated whether the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Sanskrit ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'') is distinct from, or identical to, ''[[Brahman]]'', the [[divinity|divine]] [[reality]]. [[Taoism]] sees the human being as contiguous with natural forces, and the mind as not separate from the [[Human body|body]]. [[Confucianism]] sees the mind, like the body, as inherently perfectible.

===Buddhism===
{{See also|Buddhism and psychology|Vijñāna|Śūnyatā|Shentong|Rangtong|Yogacara}}

Buddhist teachings explain the moment-to-moment manifestation of the mind-stream.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The components that make up the mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt; The Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.

According to [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosopher [[Dharmakirti]], the mind has two fundamental qualities: "clarity and cognizes". If something is not those two qualities, it cannot validly be called mind. "Clarity" refers to the fact that mind has no color, shape, size, location, weight, or any other physical characteristic, and "cognizes" that it functions to know or perceive objects.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, [[Geshe Kelsang Gyatso]], ''Understanding the Mind'': The Nature and Power of the Mind, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-78-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Knowing" refers to the fact that mind is aware of the contents of experience, and that, in order to exist, mind must be cognizing an object. You cannot have a mind – whose function is to cognize an object – existing without cognizing an object.

Mind, in Buddhism, is also described as being "space-like" and "illusion-like". Mind is space-like in the sense that it is not physically obstructive. It has no qualities which would prevent it from existing. In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, mind is illusion-like in the sense that it is empty of inherent existence. This does not mean it does not exist, it means that it exists in a manner that is counter to our ordinary way of misperceiving how phenomena exist, according to Buddhism. When the mind is itself cognized properly, without misperceiving its mode of existence, it appears to exist like an illusion. There is a big difference however between being "space and illusion" and being "space-like" and "illusion-like". Mind is not composed of space, it just shares some descriptive similarities to space. Mind is not an illusion, it just shares some descriptive qualities with illusions.

Buddhism posits that there is no inherent, unchanging identity (Inherent I, Inherent Me) or phenomena (Ultimate self, inherent self, Atman, Soul, Self-essence, Jiva, Ishvara, humanness essence, etc.) which is the experiencer of our experiences and the agent of our actions. In other words, human beings consist of merely a body and a mind, and nothing extra. Within the body there is no part or set of parts which is – by itself or themselves – the person. Similarly, within the mind there is no part or set of parts which are themselves "the person". A human being merely consists of five aggregates, or ''[[skandha]]s'' and nothing else.

In the same way, "mind" is what can be validly conceptually labelled onto our mere experience of clarity and knowing. There is something separate and apart from clarity and knowing which is "Awareness", in Buddhism. "Mind" is that part of experience the sixth sense door, which can be validly referred to as mind by the concept-term "mind". There is also not "objects out there, mind in here, and experience somewhere in-between". There is a third thing called "awareness" which exists being aware of the contents of mind and what mind cognizes. There are five senses (arising of mere experience: shapes, colors, the components of smell, components of taste, components of sound, components of touch) and mind as the sixth institution; this means, expressly, that there can be a third thing called "awareness" and a third thing called "experiencer who is aware of the experience". This awareness is deeply related to "no-self" because it does not judge the experience with craving or aversion.

Clearly, the experience arises and is known by mind, but there is a third thing calls [[Sati (Buddhism)|Sati]] what is the "real experiencer of the experience" that sits apart from the experience and which can be aware of the experience in 4 levels. (Maha Sathipatthana Sutta.)
# Body
# Sensations (Changes of the body mind.)
# Mind,
# Contents of the mind. (Changes of the body mind.)

To be aware of these four levels one needs to cultivate equanimity toward Craving and Aversion. This is Called Vipassana which is different from the way of reacting with  Craving and Aversion. This is the state of being aware and equanimous to the complete experience of here and now. This is the way of Buddhism, with regards to mind and the ultimate nature of minds (and persons).

===Mortality of the mind===
{{Main|Consciousness after death}}
Due to the [[mind–body problem]], a lot of interest and debate surrounds the question of what happens to one's conscious mind as one's body dies. During [[brain death]] all [[brain activity|brain function]] permanently ceases, according to the current neuroscientific view which sees these processes as the physical basis of mental phenomena, the mind fails to survive brain death and ceases to exist. This permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called "[[eternal oblivion]]". The belief that some [[spirit]]ual or [[incorporeal]] component ([[soul]]) exists and that it is preserved after death is described by the term "[[afterlife]]".

==In pseudoscience==
===Parapsychology===
[[Parapsychology]] is a study of certain types of [[paranormal phenomena]], or of phenomena which appear to be paranormal but it does not have any scientific basis &lt;ref&gt;[http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html#p Parapsychological Association website, Glossary of Key Words Frequently Used in Parapsychology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824232035/http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html |date=2010-08-24 }}, Retrieved February 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; for instance [[precognition]], [[telekinesis]] and [[telepathy]].

The term is based on the Greek [[:wikt:para-|para]] (beside/beyond), [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] (soul/mind), and [[logos]] (account/explanation) and was coined by psychologist [[Max Dessoir]] in or before 1889.&lt;ref name = "EncyOccult"/&gt; [[J.B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3435">[[File:Multiple nuclei model.svg|lang=en|thumb|450px|Mehrkernemodell von Harris und Ullmann|Multiple nuclei model]]
The '''multiple nuclei model''' is an economical model created by [[Chauncy Harris]] and [[Edward Ullman]] in the 1945 article "The Nature of Cities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Chauncy D.|last2=Ullman|first2=Edward L.|date=1945-01-01|title=The Nature of Cities|jstor=1026055|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=242|pages=7–17|doi=10.2307/1026055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Model==
The model describes the layout of a city, based on Chicago. It says that even though a city may have begun with a [[central business district]], or CBD, other smaller CBDs develop on the outskirts of the city near the more valuable housing areas to allow shorter commutes from the outskirts of the city. This creates nodes or nuclei in other parts of the city besides the CBD thus the name multiple nuclei model. Their aim was to produce a more realistic, if more complicated, model. Their main goals in this were to:
# Move away from the concentric zone model
# To better reflect the complex nature of urban areas, especially those of larger size

==Effects of multiple nuclei on Industry==
As multiple nuclei develop, transportation hubs such as airports are constructed which allow industries to be established with reduced transportation costs.
These transportation hubs have [[negative externalities]] such as noise pollution and lower land values, making land around the hub cheaper. Hotels are also constructed near airports because people who travel tend to want to stay near the source of travel. Housing develops in wedges and gets more expensive the farther it is from the CBD.&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, Kelly. Kaplan AP Human Geography. 2009. 2009. 360-364. eBook. &lt;https://books.google.com/books?&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for the model==

Harris and Ullman argued that cities do not grow a single nucleus but several separate nuclei. Each nucleus acts like a growth point.

The theory was formed based on the idea that people have greater movement due to increased car ownership. This increase of movement allows for the specialization of regional centers (e.g. heavy industry, business parks, retail areas). The model is suitable for the large, expanding cities. The number of nuclei around which the city expands depends upon situational as well as historical factors. Multiple nuclei develop because:
# Certain industrial activities require transportation facilities e.g. ports, railway stations, etc. to lower transportation costs.
# Various combinations of activities tend to be kept apart e.g. residential areas and airports, factories and parks, etc.
# Other activities are found together to their mutual advantage e.g. universities, bookstores and coffee shops, etc.
# Some facilities need to be set in specific areas in a city - for example the CBD requires convenient traffic systems, and many factories need an abundant source of resources.

'''Nadir and Occultation for MArs Discovery''' ('''NOMAD''') is a 3-channel [[spectrometer]] on board the [[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]] (TGO) launched to [[Mars]] orbit on 14 March 2016.

NOMAD is designed to perform high-sensitivity orbital identification of atmospheric components, concentration and temperature, their sources, loss, and cycles. It measures the sunlight reflected from the surface and atmosphere of Mars, and it analyses its wavelength [[spectrum]] to identify the components of the [[Martian atmosphere]] that may suggest a [[biosignature|biological source]].  The Principal Investigator is Ann Carine Vandaele, from the [[Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy]], Belgium.

==Overview==

NOMAD is one of four science instruments on board the European ExoMars TGO orbiter. This spectrometer consists of three separate channels: solar occultation (SO), limb nadir and occultation (LNO), and ultraviolet and visible spectrometer (UVIS). The first two channels work in the [[infrared]] (2.2 to 4.3 μm); the third channel (UVIS) works in the UV-visible range (0.2 to 0.65 μm), which is able to measure [[ozone]], [[sulphuric acid]], and perform aerosol studies.&lt;ref name='IVRA'&gt;[http://mars.aeronomie.be/en/exomars/nomad.htm ExoMars NOMAD instrument.] [[Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy]]. Accessed: 13 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='NOMAD home'/&gt; Measurements are carried out during solar [[occultation]], i.e. the instrument points toward the sunset as the orbiter moves toward or away the dark side of Mars. It also measures in [[nadir]] mode, i.e. looking directly at the sunlight reflected from the surface and atmosphere of Mars.&lt;ref name='NOMAD home'&gt; [http://exploration.esa.int/mars/48523-trace-gas-orbiter-instruments/?fbodylongid=2187 ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter Instruments - NOMAD.] [[European Space Agency]]. 4 November 2016.

==Objectives==

NADIR will map the composition and distribution of Mars' atmospheric trace gases and [[isotope]]s in unprecedented detail. The specific objectives are: &lt;ref&gt;[https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=2016-017A-02 Nadir and Occultation for Mars Discovery (NOMAD)]. NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive. Accessed: 18 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*search for signs of past or present [[life on Mars]].
*investigate how the water and geochemical environment varies
*investigate Martian atmospheric trace gases and their sources.
*study the surface environment and identify hazards to future [[Human mission to Mars|crewed missions to Mars]].
*investigate the planet subsurface and deep interior to better understand the evolution and [[planetary habitability|habitability]] of Mars.

To achieve these objectives, NOMAD covers a spectral region from UV, visible, and infrared that that reveals the signatures of the following molecules and isotopologues: 
CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (including &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;OCO, &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;OCO, C&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), CO (including &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CO, C&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O), H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (including [[Semiheavy water|HDO]]), NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, [[ozone|O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] (including &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;D), C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO, HCN, OCS, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, HCl, HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;ref name='Patel 2014'/&gt;

In particular, the detection of the different methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) isotopologues (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;D) will be key to help determine whether they are of geological ([[Serpentinite|serpentinisation]], [[clathrate]]s) or a biological source.&lt;ref name='Patel 2014'/&gt; In addition, NOMAD can detect formaldehyde ([[Formaldehyde|{{chem|H|2|CO}}]]) which is a photochemical product of methane, as well as nitrous oxide ([[Nitrous oxide|{{chem|N|2|O}}]]) and hydrogen sulfide ([[Hydrogen sulfide|{{chem|H|2|S}}]]) which are potential atmospheric [[biosignature]]s.&lt;ref name='Patel 2014'/&gt; SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a gas related to volcanism may reveal present or recent [[Volcanism on Mars|volcanic activity on Mars]].&lt;ref name='Patel 2014'/&gt;

'''Nitrogen nutrition in the [[arbuscular mycorrhiza]]l system''' refers to...

==Role of nitrogen==
[[Nitrogen]] is a vital [[nutrient|macronutrient]] for plants, necessary for the [[biosynthesis]] of many basic cellular components, such as [[DNA]], [[RNA]] and [[proteins]]. Nitrogen is obtained by plants through roots from inorganic or organic sources, such as [[amino acids]].&lt;ref&gt;Govindarajulu, Manjula; Pfeffer,Philip E.; Jin, Hairu; Abubaker, Jehad; Douds, David D; Allen, James W.; Bucking, Heike; Lammers, Peter J.; Shachar-Hill, Yair (2005). "Sulfur Transfer through an Arbuscular Mycorrhiza". ''Plant Physiology'' 149:549-560&lt;/ref&gt; In agricultural settings, nitrogen may be a limiting factor for plant growth and yield, and in total, as a critical cellular component that a plant deficient in this nitrogen will shunt resources away from its shoot in order to expand its root system so that it can acquire more nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;Marschner, Horst. ''Mineral Nutrition of Higher Plants''. Academic Press, 2002, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Arbuscular mycorrhiza|Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi]] are divided into two parts depending on where the [[mycelium]] is located. The intra-radical mycelia (IRM) are found within the root itself while the extra-radical mycelium (ERM) are tiny [[hypha]]l threads which reach far out into the soil. The IRM is the site of nutrient exchange between the [[symbiont]]s, while the ERM effectively serves as an extension of the plant's root system by increasing the surface area available for nutrient acquisition, including nitrogen, which can be taken up in the form of [[ammonium]], [[nitrate]] or from organic sources.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, James W. and Shachar-Hill, Yair (2009). "Sulfur Transfer through an Arbuscular Mycorrhiza". ''Plant Physiology'' 149:549-560&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leigh, Joanne; Hodge, Angela; Fitter, Alastair H.(2008). "Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi can Transfer Substantial Amounts of Nitrogen to their Host Plant from Organic Material". "New Phytologist " 181:199ñ207&lt;/ref&gt; Working with an ''[[in vitro]]'' system, studies have shown that as much as 29%&lt;ref&gt;Govindarajulu, Manjula; Pfeffer,Philip E.; Jin, Hairu; Abubaker, Jehad; Douds, David D; Allen, James W.; Bucking, Heike; Lammers, Peter J.; Shachar-Hill, Yair (2005) "Nitrogen transfer in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis". ''Nature'' 435:819-823&lt;/ref&gt; to 50%&lt;ref&gt;Jin, H; Pfeffer, P. E.; Douds, D. D.; Piotrowski, E.; Lammers, P. J.; Shachar-Hill, Yair (2005). "The uptake, metabolism, transport and transfer of nitrogen in an arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis". ''New Phytologist'' 168:687ñ696&lt;/ref&gt; of the root nitrogen was taken up via the fungus. This is also true in ''in planta'' studies, such as an experiment in which the researchers showed that 75% of the nitrogen in a young [[maize]] leaf originated from the ERM.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, Yoko; Yano, Katsuya (2005). "Nitrogen delivery to maize via mycorrhizal hyphae depends on the form of N supplied". ''Plant, Cell and Environment'' 28:1247-1254.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanism of action===
The precise mechanism(s) by which nitrogen is taken up from the soil by the ERM, transported to the IRM, and then turned over to the plant are still under investigation. Toward elucidating the mechanisms through which nitrogen transfer is completed, the sum of numerous studies have provided the necessary tools to study this process. For example, the detection and measurement of [[gene expression]] has enabled researchers to determine which genes are [[downregulation and upregulation|up-regulated]] in the plant and fungus under various nitrogen conditions. Another important tool is the use of the nitrogen [[isotope]] [[&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]], which can be distinguished from the more common &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N isotope. Nitrogen-containing compounds thus labeled can be tracked and measured as they move through the fungus and into the plant, as well as how they are incorporated into nitrogen-containing molecules.

The current model, first put forth in 2005, proposes that the nitrogen taken up by the fungus is converted in the ERM to [[arginine]], which is then transported to the IRM, where it is released as ammonium into the [[apoplast]] for the plant to use.&lt;ref&gt;Govindarajulu, Manjula; Pfeffer,Philip E.; Jin, Hairu; Abubaker, Jehad; Douds, David D; Allen, James W.; Bucking, Heike; Lammers, Peter J.; Shachar-Hill, Yair (2005) "Nitrogen transfer in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis". ''Nature'' 435:819-823&lt;/ref&gt; A growing body of data has supported and expanded upon this model. Support has been found primarily in two ways: labeling experiments and the study of gene expression, as demonstrated in a 2010 paper by Tian ''et al.'' When labeled nitrogen compounds were added to the ERM compartment of an in vitro bsystem, six fungal genes encoding [[enzyme]]s involved in the incorporation of inorganic nitrogen into [[glutamine]] and its subsequent conversion to arginine were rapidly up-regulated. After a delay, gene expression in the IRM began to show increasing levels of [[mRNA]] for genes involved in the breakdown of arginine into [[urea]] and the subsequent cleaving of ammonium from the urea molecule. This change in gene expression takes place concurrently with the arrival of &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N labeled arginine from the ERM compartment.&lt;ref&gt;Tian, Chunjie; Kasiborski, Beth; Koul, Raman; Lammers, Peter J.; Bucking, Heike; Shachar-Hill, Yair (2010). Regulation of the Nitrogen Transfer Pathway in the Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbiosis: Gene Characterization and the Coordination of Expression with Nitrogen Flux". ''Plant Physiology'' 153:1175-1187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once inside the ERM, the nitrogen molecule may have to travel many centimeters to reach the root. While much progress has been made on either end of the transfer of nitrogen, the mechanism by which the arginine actually moves from the ERM to the IRM remains unresolved. AM fungi are non-septate and lack cell walls between cells, forming one long filament. However, passive flow through the continuous cytoplasm is too slow to explain the transport of nutrients. The mechanism by which the newly manufactured arginine is transported to the plant requires further investigation.

===Community and ecology===

A single plant with its associated fungus is not an isolated entity. It has been shown that mycelia from the roots of one plant actually colonize the roots of nearby plants, creating an underground network of plants of the same or different species. It has been demonstrated that nitrogen is transferred between plants via the hyphal network, sometimes in large amounts. For example, Cheng and Baumgartner found that about 25% of the labeled nitrogen supplied to a source plant, in this case a grass species, was transferred to the sink plant, grapevine.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, Xiaomei and Baumgartner, Kendra (2004). "Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-mediated nitrogen transfer from vineyard cover crops to grapevines". ''Biology and Fertility of Soils'' 40:406-412.&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely believed that these hyphal networks are important to local ecosystems and may have agricultural implications.

Some plants, called [[legumes]], can form simultaneous symbiotic relationships with both AM fungi and the nitrogen-fixing bacteria [[nitrogen-fixing bacteria|Rhizobia]]. In fact, both organisms trigger the same pathways in plants during early colonization, indicating that the two very different responses could share a common origin. While the bacteria can supply nitrogen, they cannot provide other benefits of AM fungi; AM actually enhances bacterial colonization, probably by supplying extra phosphorus for the formation of the bacterial habitat within the plant, and thus contributing indirectly to the plant's nitrogen status.&lt;ref&gt;Barea, J. M.; Escudero, J. L.; Azcon-G de Aguilar, C. (1980). "Effects of introduced and indigenous VA mycorrhizal fungi on nodulation, growth and nutrition of Medicago sativa in phosphate-fixing soils as affected by P fertilizers". ''Plant and Soil'' 54:283-296&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known if there is signaling between the two, or only between the plant and each microbe. There is almost certainly competition between the bacterial and fungal partners, whether directly or indirectly, due to the fact that both are dependent on the plant as their sole source of energy. The plant must strive to strike a delicate balance between the maintenance of both partners based on its nutrient status.

=== Alternate theories ===
A large body of research has shown that AM fungi can, and do, transfer nitrogen to plants and transfer nitrogen between plants, including crop plants. However, it has not been shown conclusively that there is a growth benefit from AM due to nitrogen. Some researchers doubt that AM contribute significantly to plant N status in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, S. E. and Read, D. J. ''Mycorrhizal Symbiosis''. Academic Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In one field study, there was negligible transfer between soybeans and corn.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, Chantal and Smith, Donald L. (1992). "Mycorrhizae-mediated 15N transfer from soybean to corn in field-grown intercrops: Effect of component crop spatial relationships". ''Soil Biology and Biochemistry'' 24:499-501.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, AM sometimes appears to be parasitic. This has primarily been seen under conditions of high nitrogen, which is not the usual state in a natural environment. However, it has been shown that in at least one case, colonization by AM fungi under nitrogen-limiting conditions lead to decreased shoot biomass,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Nancy Collins; Wilson, Gail W. T.; Bowker, Matthew A.;Wilson, Jacqueline A.; Miller, R. Michael (2010). "Resource limitation is a driver of local adaptation in mychorrhizal symbioses". ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' 107:2093-2098.&lt;/ref&gt; implying that the relationship does the plant more harm than good. Likewise in a multi-plant system it would be very difficult to find the advantage to the source plants when their nutrients are being shunted to sink plants. These findings are at odds with the observed phenomenon that under conditions of low phosphorus, the degree of AM colonization is inversely proportional to nitrogen availability.&lt;ref&gt;Blanke, Verena; Renker, Carsten; Wagner, Markus; Füllner, Kerstin; Held, Matthias; Kuhn, Arnd J.; Buscot, François (2005). "Nitrogen supply affects arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization of Artemisia vulgaris in a phosphate-polluted field site". ''New Phytologist'' 166:981-992.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the plant must supply all of the energy needed to grow and sustain the fungus, it seems counter-intuitive that it would do so without some benefit to itself. Further studies are definitely needed to delineate the details of the relationship between the symbionts, including a gradient of interaction that runs from mutualism to parasitism.

The '''Orlando Science Center''' ('''OSC''') is a private science museum located in [[Orlando, Florida]]. Its purposes are to provide experience-based opportunities for learning about science and technology and to promote public understanding of science.

The Orlando Science Center is accredited by the [[American Alliance of Museums]] (AAM) and is a member of the [[Association of Science-Technology Centers]] (ASTC). The Orlando Science Center is member supported and sponsored in part by United Arts of Central Florida, Inc., the State of Florida, Department of State, Division of Cultural Affairs and the Florida Arts Council.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.osc.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission statement ==
Inspire science learning for life.

== History ==
Incorporated in 1955, the Central Florida Museum (CFM) opened in Orlando Loch Haven Park in 1960. For its first decade, it was an anthropology museum with collections of artifacts relating to [[Florida]] and the [[Caribbean Basin]].

In the early 1970s, the CFM's board of directors voted to change directions and to become a "hands-on" science and technology center. In 1973 the institution was renamed to honor a famous native son and astronaut, [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]].

In 1984, as part of an expansion and change of philosophy, the institution's name was changed to Orlando Science Center. In 1985 another major expansion created a permanent physical sciences hall, a traveling exhibit hall, and Curiosity Corner, a hands-on exhibit area dedicated to pre-school and early primary age children. Its new facility was the setting for the Orlando Children's Museum scenes in ''[[Ernest Saves Christmas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2014/06/20/location-matters-various-points-from-ernest-saves-christmas|title= Location Matters: various points from 'Ernest Saves Christmas'|date= June 10, 2014|work=Orlando Weekly|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the final expansion to the original facility in 1990, NatureWorks, a prototype for OSC's centerpiece natural science exhibit was created.

In May 1992, the Board and staff developed a comprehensive master plan for the Orlando Science Center, including a blueprint for construction of an entirely new science center. Construction of the new science center began in early 1995.

The new {{convert|207000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} Orlando Science Center celebrated its grand opening on February 1, 1997. It is six times larger than the original facility, which closed December 31, 1996. The current president and CEO of the science center is JoAnn Newman.

== Exhibits ==
These are the current exhibits within the Orlando Science Center 
*'''NatureWorks'''  - 1st Floor - Exhibit hall that describes the richness of the natural world, with a focus on the diverse ecosystems of Central Florida. Such as, plants and animals of coral reefs, cypress swamps, mangrove, and other Florida environments. You can learn how living and non-living things interact with each other and their environment.
*'''KidsTown''' - 2nd Floor - Miniature town that introduces science concepts through whole-body experiences, hands-on interactives and  imaginative role-playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/os-orlando-science-center-kids-town-20160909-story.html|title=Orlando Science Center hopes Kids Town can be boom town|date= September 9, 2016|work=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Kinetic Zone''' - 2nd Floor - An eclectic array of hands-on, interactive exhibits, Kinetic Zone lets visitors explore the fundamentals of forces, such as electricity, gravity, Newton's Laws and much more. Visitors can engage in a series of hands-on challenges that invite them to design, build and test their own.
*'''The Hive: A Makerspace''' - 3rd Floor - A collaborative work space for making, learning, exploring, and sharing. The Hive is a space that cultivates community and emphasizes learning opportunities in every failure and success. 
*'''Fusion: A STEAM Gallery''' – 3rd Floor Mezzanine - The Orlando Science Center's art gallery which integrates art into the STEM curriculum. All art displayed has a fusion of art and technology. While the Gallery will remain as a permanent part of the Science Center, the exhibition is updated intermittently
*'''DinoDigs''' - 4th Floor - Exhibit consisting of fossil replicas of dinosaurs and prehistoric sea creatures. Uncover fossils in the giant dig pit "Jurassic Ridge"; examine real, fossilized dino eggs; explore displays that feature ancient land and marine reptiles; compare reptiles and dinosaurs to see similarities and differences; and discover denizens of the ancient oceans such as Elasmosaurus and Tylosaurus.
*'''Our Planet''' - 4th Floor - This exhibit is geared to exploring the strange, curious and odd peculiarities of the universe and our place within it. Discover the dynamic forces and systems that shape Earth and uncover the mysteries of the solar system. Experiences include computer-based interactives and visuals, such as images direct from the NASA Hubble Space Telescope, and hands-on stations that explore some strange and familiar phenomena. There is also a Virtusphere: a 10-foot hollow sphere that rotate freely in any direction based to the user's steps. 
*'''Crosby Observatory''' - 6th Floor - Florida's largest public refractor telescope as well as an array of smaller yet still powerful telescopes strategically placed for star gazing. The Crosby Observatory is open from 3-5pm for SunWatch on the first Saturday of each month, weather permitting, and from 5-9 on the first and third Saturday of the month, weather permitting (exhibit halls are closed during this time).

== Traveling Exhibits ==
The Science Center has a history of hosting traveling exhibits that are displayed for a few months at a time in different galleries.

== Theaters ==
The Science Center has two movie theaters that show both educational and Hollywood films as well as laser light shows. Check the Orlando Science Center website for a current list of movie show times.
*'''Dr. Phillips Cinedome''' - Featuring a giant screen measuring 8,000 square feet, the 300-seat Dr. Phillips CineDome projects films through a fisheye lens, creating an image that surrounds the audience and extends well beyond their peripheral vision. It uses the largest film format in the world, 10 times larger than a conventional film theater. It's commonly called 15/70, meaning 15 perforations (horizontally) on a 70&amp;nbsp;mm print.
*'''Digital Adventure Theater''' - One of the first museums to join a national effort with National Geographic,  the Science Center has special access to one of the world's largest giant-screen film libraries that includes award-winning films in 2D and 3D digital formats. In addition, this theater also shows select Hollywood movies and Science Live! programs such as Kaboom! and High Voltage.

== Annual Events ==
*'''[[Otronicon]]'''- Four day event that lets guests experience, interact, and learn with STEM industry leaders and educators, experience the future of games and design, see the latest in medical and military technologies, check out workshops and panels led by industry pros, and look at art from a new and exciting angle with the fusion of art and technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://otronicon.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Science Night Live'''-Grown-up inspired programming including Science Trivia, experiments, 3D films, special presentations, laser light, stars and planets viewing through the giant refractor telescope in the Crosby Observatory.&lt;ref&gt;http://attractionsmagazine.com/orlando-science-center-offer-adults-night/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dead tree river.jpg|right|thumb|Terrestrial and aquatic phototrophs: plants grow on a fallen log floating in algae-rich water]]

'''Phototrophs''' (''[[Ancient Greek language|Gr]]'': φῶς, φωτός&lt;!-- Phos is an odd kszettle of fish, see Liddell-Scott-Jones Greek Lexicon --&gt; = light, τροϕή = nourishment) are the [[organism]]s that carry out photon capture to acquire energy.  They use the [[energy]] from [[light]] to carry out various cellular metabolic processes.  It is a common misconception that phototrophs are obligatorily [[photosynthetic]].  Many, but not all, phototrophs often photosynthesize: they [[Anabolism|anabolically]] convert [[carbon dioxide]] into organic material to be utilized structurally, functionally, or as a source for later [[Catabolism|catabolic]] processes (e.g. in the form of starches, sugars and fats).  All phototrophs either use [[electron transport chain]]s or direct [[proton pump]]ing to establish an electro-chemical gradient which is utilized by [[ATP synthase]], to provide the molecular energy currency for the cell. 
Phototrophs can be either [[autotroph]]s or [[heterotroph]]s. As their electron and hydrogen donors are inorganic compounds [Na2S2O3 (PSB) and H2S (GSB)] they can be also called as lithotrophs, and so, some photoautotrophs are also called photolithoautotrophs. Examples of phototroph organisms:  ''[[Rhodobacter capsulatus]]'', ''[[Chromatium]]'', ''[[Chlorobium]]'' etc.

==History==
Originally used with a different meaning, the term took its current definition after [[André Lwoff|Lwoff]] and collaborators (1946).&lt;ref&gt;Lwoff, A., C.B. van Niel, P.J. Ryan, and E.L. Tatum (1946). Nomenclature of nutritional types of microorganisms. ''Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology'' (5th edn.), Vol. XI, The Biological Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, pp. 302–303, [http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/11/local/back-matter.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, С. K. 1917. ''Illustriertes Handwörterbuch der Botanik.'' 2. Aufl., herausgeg. von K. Linsbauer. Leipzig: Engelmann, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/32951#/summary].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photoautotroph==
Most of the well-recognized phototrophs are [[autotrophic]], also known as '''photoautotrophs''', and can [[carbon fixation|fix carbon]]. They can be contrasted with [[chemotroph]]s that obtain their energy by the [[oxidation]] of [[electron donor]]s in their environments. Photoautotrophs are capable of synthesizing their own food from inorganic substances using light as an energy source. Green plants and photosynthetic bacteria are photoautotrophs. Photoautotrophic organisms are sometimes referred to as '''holophytic'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Facts on File dictionary of biology | last=Hine | first=Robert | publisher=Infobase Publishing | year=2005 | page=175 | isbn=978-0-8160-5648-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such organisms derive their energy for food synthesis from light and are capable of using carbon dioxide as their principal source of carbon.

Oxygenic photosynthetic organisms use [[chlorophyll]] for light-energy capture and oxidize water, [[Oxygen-evolving complex|"splitting"]] it into molecular oxygen.  In contrast, anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria have a substance called [[bacteriochlorophyll]] - which absorbs predominantly at non-optical wavelengths - for light-energy capture, live in aquatic environments, and will, using light, oxidize chemical substances such as [[hydrogen sulfide]] rather than water.

===Ecology===
In an [[ecology|ecological]] context, phototrophs are often the food source for neighboring heterotrophic life. In terrestrial environments, [[plant]]s are the predominant variety, while aquatic environments include a range of phototrophic organisms such as [[algae]] (e.g., [[kelp]]), other [[protist]]s (such as [[euglena]]), [[phytoplankton]], and [[bacteria]] (such as [[cyanobacteria]]). The depth to which sunlight or artificial light can penetrate into water, so that photosynthesis may occur, is known as the [[photic zone]].

Cyanobacteria, which are prokaryotic organisms which carry out oxygenic photosynthesis, occupy many environmental conditions, including fresh water, seas, [[soil]], and [[lichen]]. Cyanobacteria carry out plant-like photosynthesis because the [[chloroplast|organelle]] in plants that carries out photosynthesis is derived from an &lt;ref&gt;Hill, Malcolm S. “Production Possibility Frontiers in Phototroph:heterotroph Symbioses: Trade-Offs in Allocating Fixed Carbon Pools and the Challenges These Alternatives Present for Understanding the Acquisition of Intracellular Habitats.” ''Frontiers in Microbiology'' 5 (2014): 357. ''PMC''. Web. 11 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; endosymbiotic cyanobacterium.&lt;ref&gt;3. Johnson, Lewis, Morgan, Raff, Roberts, and Walter. "Energy Conversion: Mitochondria and Chloroplast." ''Molecular Biology of the Cell, Sixth Edition''  By Alberts. 6th ed. New York: Garland Science, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2015. 774+. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This bacterium can use water as a source of [[Electron transport chain|electrons]] in order to perform CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  [[Redox|reduction]] reactions. Evolutionarily, cyanobacteria's ability to survive in [[Oxygenic photosynthesis|oxygenic]] conditions, which are considered toxic to most [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] bacteria, might have given the bacteria an adaptive advantage which could have allowed the cyanobacteria to populate more efficiently.

A ''photolithoautotroph'' is an [[autotrophic]] organism that uses light energy, and an [[inorganic compound|inorganic]] [[electron donor]] (e.g., H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S), and [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] as its [[carbon]] source. Examples include plants.

==Photoheterotroph==
{{Main|Photoheterotroph}}

In contrast to photoautotrophs, '''photoheterotrophs''' are organisms that depend solely on light for their energy and principally on organic compounds for their carbon. Photoheterotrophs produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] through [[photophosphorylation]] but use environmentally obtained [[organic compound]]s to build structures and other bio-molecules.&lt;ref name="campbell564"&gt;{{Cite book|

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2281">In [[computer-generated imagery]] and real-time [[3D computer graphics]], '''portal rendering''' is an algorithm for [[Hidden surface determination|visibility determination]]. For example, consider a 3D computer game environment, which may contain many polygons, only a few of which may be visible on screen at a given time. By determining which polygons are currently not visible, and not rendering those objects, significant performance improvements can be achieved.

A portal system is based on using the partitioning of space to form generalizations about the visibility of objects within those spaces. Regions of map space are divided into polygonal, generally convex, areas called ''zones'', or sometimes ''sectors''. Adjacent zones are linked to one another via shared dividing polygons termed ''portals''.  Approaches that precompute visibility for zones are referred to as [[potentially visible set]] or ''PVS'' methods.

For example, in a [[computer game]] such as ''[[Descent (video game)|Descent]]'', the game area might be divided into several zones. These zones would then be connected to each other by small openings such as doors or windows. These openings are referred to as ''portals''. When the zone behind a portal needs to be drawn, the only parts that are visible are the parts that can be seen through the portal. Therefore, the zone can be [[clipping (computer graphics)|clipped]] against the portal boundaries to remove overdraw.

The use of portals simplifies the [[game engine]]'s task of determining visible areas and objects from any given point of view of the level, and simplifies rendering by allowing it to use each portal as a [[viewing frustum]] for the area it leads to. Ideally, portals are formed of confined areas (like doors or tunnels), connecting two complex areas of the scene, where each of these areas would be enclosed in such a polygonal body.

Portals are best suited for indoor scenes such as mazes. Outdoor scenes do not usually have door-like objects that would clearly separate one zone from another.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8918">'''Postsecularism''' refers to a range of theories regarding the persistence or [[Growth of religion|resurgence of religious beliefs]] or practices in the present. The "post-" may refer to after the end of secularism or after the beginning of secularism.

== Use ==
The term “postsecular” has been used in sociology, political theory,&lt;ref&gt;Kyrlezhev, Aleksandr. “The Postsecular Age: Religion and Culture Today.” Trans. Joera Mulders and Philip Walters. Religion, State and Society 36.1 (2008): 21-31. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLennan, Gregor. “The Postsecular Turn.” Theory, Culture &amp; Society 27.4 (2010): 3-20. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; religious studies, art studies,&lt;ref&gt;King, Mike. “Art and the Postsecular.” Journal of Visual Art Practice 4.1 (2005): 3-17. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; literary studies,&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Michael. “Locating the Postsecular.” Religion &amp; Literature 41.3 (2009): 67-73. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed, Feisal G. Milton and the Post-Secular Present: Ethics, Politics, Terrorism. Stanford, CA: Stanford UP, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Educational Philosophy for a Post-secular Age|last=Lewin|first=David|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781138923669|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other fields. [[Jürgen Habermas]] is widely credited for popularizing the term,&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen. "Secularism's Crisis of Faith: Notes on Post-Secular Society". ''New perspectives quarterly''. vol. 25 (2008) p.&amp;nbsp;17-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reder, Michael and Josef Schmidt. “Habermas and Religion.” An Awareness of What Is Missing: Faith and Reason in a Post-Secular Age. Jürgen Habermas, et al. Trans. Ciaran Cronin. Cambridge, UK: Polity, 2010. 1-14. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to current times in which the idea of modernity is perceived as failing and, at times, morally unsuccessful, so that, rather than a stratification or separation, a new peaceful dialogue and tolerant coexistence between the spheres of faith and reason&lt;ref&gt;The title of a very recent book of [[Jean-Marc-Ferry]] is ''La Raison et la foi''&lt;/ref&gt; must be sought in order to learn mutually.&lt;ref&gt;Buston, Fernando del. 2014. ''[«El Estado debe proteger a la religión»]''. El Comercio. Date access: January 10, 2015: ''"Jürgen Habermas ha acuñado el término de postsecularidad. Se da por fallida la idea central de la modernidad de que la religión iba a desaparecer y se establece una nueva relación entre razón y religión. Habermas plantea que es necesario emprender un aprendizaje mutuo entre las sociedades modernas y las creencias, o entre razón secular y fe. Se inicia una nueva época de mutuas tolerancias. La razón no puede echar por la borda el potencial de sentido de las religiones y éstas deben traducir sus contenidos racionalmente."''&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, Habermas insists that both religious people and secularist people should not exclude each other, but to learn from one another and coexist tolerantly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resetdoc.org/EN/Habermas-Istanbul.php A “post-secular” society – what does that mean?] by Jurgen Habermas June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Javier Espinosa. ''[http://www.uclm.es/actividades0304/seminarios/spinoza/pdf/cuadernos/22.pdf The religion in the public sphere. Habermas, Toland and Spinoza]''. Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha&lt;/ref&gt; Massimo Rosati says that in a post secular society, religious and secular perspectives are on even ground, meaning that the two theoretically share equal importance. Modern societies that have considered themselves fully secular until recently have to change their value systems accordingly as to properly accommodate this co-existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Making of a Postsecular Society: A Durkheimian Approach to Memory, Pluralism and Religion in Turkey (Classical and Contemporary Social Theory)|last = Rosati|first = Massimo|publisher = Ashgate Publishing Company|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1472423122|location = |pages = 83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Taylor’s ''[[A Secular Age]]'' is also frequently invoked as describing the postsecular,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, James K. A. “Secular Liturgies and the Prospects for a ‘Post-Secular’ Sociology of Religion.” The Post-Secular in Question: Religion in Contemporary Society. Ed. Philip S. Gorski, et al. New York, NY: New York UP 2012. 159-184. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; though there is sometimes disagreement over what each author meant with the term. Particularly contested is the question of whether “postsecular” refers to a new sociological phenomenon or to a new awareness of an existing phenomenon—that is, whether society was secular and now is becoming post-secular or whether society was never and is not now becoming secular even though many people had thought it was or thought it was going to be.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, Rhonda Hustedt, and Douglas G. Jacobsen. “Postsecular America: A New Context for Higher Education.” The American University in a Postsecular Age. Ed. Rhonda Hustedt Jacobsen and Douglas G. Jacobsen. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2008. 3-16. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Jeffrey K. “Toward Desacralizing Secularization Theory.” Social Forces 65.3 (1987): 587-611. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggest that the term is so conflicted as to be of little use.&lt;ref&gt;Beckford, James A. “Public Religions and the Postsecular: Critical Reflections.” Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 51.1 (2012): 1-19. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that the flexibility of the term is one of its strengths.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, Allen. “The Precarious Integrity of the Postsecular.” Boundary 2: An International Journal of Literature and Culture 37.3 (2010): 91-99. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In literary studies, the term has been used to indicate a sort of postmodern religious or spiritual sensibility in certain contemporary texts.&lt;ref&gt;McClure, John A..  Partial Faiths: Postsecular Fiction in the Age of Pynchon and Morrison. Athens, GA: U of Georgia P, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3000">'''Quantum complexity theory''' is a part of [[computational complexity theory]] in [[theoretical computer science]]. It studies [[complexity classes]] defined using [[quantum computers]] and [[quantum information]] which are [[computational model]]s based on [[quantum mechanics]]. It studies the hardness of problems in relation to these complexity classes, and the relationship between quantum complexity classes and classical (i.e., non-quantum) complexity classes.

==Overview==
A complexity class is a collection of problems which can be solved by some computational model under resource constraints. For instance, the complexity class [[P (complexity)|P]] is defined to be the set of problems solvable by a [[Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]]. Similarly, one may define a quantum complexity class using a quantum model of computation, such as a standard [[quantum computer]] or a [[quantum Turing machine]]. Thus, the complexity class [[BQP]] is defined to be the set of problems solvable by a quantum computer in polynomial time with bounded error.

Two important quantum complexity classes are [[BQP]] and [[QMA]] which are the bounded-error quantum analogues of [[P (complexity)|P]] and [[NP (complexity)|NP]]. One of the main aims of quantum complexity theory is to find out where these classes lie with respect to classical complexity classes such as P, NP, [[PP (complexity)|PP]], [[PSPACE]] and [[List of complexity classes|other complexity classes]].

==Quantum query complexity==
In the query complexity model, the input is given as an oracle (black box). The algorithm gets information about the input only by querying the oracle. The algorithm starts in some fixed quantum state and the state evolves as it queries the oracle.

Quantum Query Complexity is the smallest number of queries to the oracle that are required in order to calculate the function. Clearly, Quantum Query Complexity is a lower bound on the overall time complexity of a function.

An example depicting the power of Quantum Computing is [[Grover's algorithm]] for searching unstructured databases. Its Quantum Query Complexity is &lt;math display="inline"&gt;O{\left(\sqrt{N}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;, a quadratically improvement over the best possible classical query complexity, a [[linear search]].

The '''semiotics of social networking''' discusses the images, symbols and signs used in systems that allow users to communicate and share experiences with each other. Examples of social networking systems include [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and [[Instagram]].

== Semiotics ==
[[Semiotics]] is a discipline that studies images, symbols, signs and other similarly related objects in an effort to understand their use and meaning. Semiotic [[structuralism]] seeks the meaning of these objects within a social context. [[Post-structuralist]] theories take tools from structuralist semiotics in combination with social interaction, creating social semiotics.&lt;ref name="Chandler 2007"&gt;Chandler, D. 2007. Semiotics: The Basics, 2nd ed., New York, NY, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social semiotics]] is “a branch of the field of semiotics which investigates human signifying practices in specific social and cultural circumstances and which tries to explain meaning-making as a social practice.” “Social semiotics also examines semiotic practices, specific to a culture and community, for the making of various kinds of texts and meanings in various situational contexts and contexts of culturally meaningful activity”.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, J. L. Important Theories for Research Topics. 2002. Internet on-line. Available from [http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/education/jlemke/theories.htm academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Social semiotics is concerned with studying human interactions.&lt;ref name="Hodge Kress 1988"&gt;Hodge, R., and G. Kress. 1988. Social Semiotics. Polity: Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social networking==
Social networking is the communication among people within a virtual social space.&lt;ref&gt;Artsnooze. Social Networking (Semiotics, Phenomenology, Epistemology, Ontology, Culture studies). 2009. Internet on-line. Available from [https://www.scribd.com/doc/18011361/Social-Networking-Semiotics-Phenomenology-Epistemology-Ontology-Culture-Studies scribd.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This medium of communication allows insight into the significance of social semiotics. “Millions of people now interact through blogs, collaborate through wikis, play multiplayer games, publish podcasts and video, build relationships through social network sites and evaluate all the above forms of communication through feedback and ranking mechanisms”.&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, Mark, Douglas Grimes. 2007. Audience, Authorship, and Artifact: The Emergent Semiotics of Web 2.0. Cambridge Journal 27, no. Annual Review of Applied Linguistic: 1-1-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Social semiotics “unlike speech, writing necessitates some sort of technology in the form of person device interaction”.&lt;ref&gt;Noy, Chaim. 2008. Mediation materialized: The Semiotics of a Visitor Book at an Israeli Commemoration Site. Critical Studies in Media Communication 25, no. 2: 175(21).&lt;/ref&gt; Social semiotics functions through the triad of communication or [[semiotic elements and classes of signs|Peircean semiotics]] in the form of sign, object, interpretant&lt;ref&gt;Mules, Warwick. 1997. The Social Semiotics of Mass Communication. Journal of Communication 47 p166(4).&lt;/ref&gt; (Chart 1) and “Human, Machine, Tag (Information)”&lt;ref&gt;Social Tagging, Online Communication, and Peircean Semiotics. 2008. Internet on-line. Available from the website http://www.slideshare.net/andreasinica/social-tagging-online-communication-and-peircean-semiotics-presentation&lt;/ref&gt; (Chart 2). In Peircean semiotics (Chart 1), "A sign…[in the form of representamen] is something which stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity. It addresses somebody, that is, creates in the mind of that person an equivalent sign, or perhaps a more developed sign. That sign which it creates I call the interpretant of the first sign. The sign stands for an object, not in all respects, but in reference to a sort of idea which I have something called the ground of the representamen".&lt;ref name="Chandler 2007" /&gt;

Hershey, PA: IGI Global.&lt;/ref&gt; The Human takes the photo on a camera and puts the digital file (information) on the Machine, the Machine is then navigated to Facebook where the file is downloaded. The Human has the Machine Tag the photo with information (e. g., names, places, data) for other Humans to see. This process then can be continued (see Chart 2). “Collaborative tagging has been quickly gaining ground because of its ability to recruit the activity of web users into effectively organizing and sharing large amounts of information”.&lt;ref&gt;Cattuto, Ciro, Vittorio Loreto, and Luciano Pietronero. 2007.

'''Sky-Map.org''' (or '''WikiSky.org''') is a [[wiki]] and interactive sky [[map]] that covers more than half a billion celestial objects. Users can view the whole star sky at once and zoom in to view areas in greater detail. WikiSky includes many stars, galaxies, constellations, and planets, but it is still in development. Users can also edit information about different stars by writing articles, adding Internet links, uploading images, or create a special interest group for a specific task. The website, although still available for users to visit, has not shown much activity since 2010.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Software==
{{unsourced section|date=December 2013}}
Users may browse the sky in several surveys, including [[GALEX]], [[Digitized Sky Survey|DSS]], and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]]. In either mode, the user can access the name and a brief description of visible objects. This can be used to access more detailed information, including articles and different photo images.

Sky-Map.org also has its own API so that code can be written to access maps, objects’ information and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] data. The API that has more functionality than the interactive part of the website currently uses.

[[File:Space syntax - Global Integration - Brasilia.svg|thumb|250px|Map of axis lines in Brasília. The colors show the global integration of the different streets, measuring the accessibility of a topological line for the entire system according to the spatial analysis of the space syntax. Created with Mindwalk 1.0]]
The term '''space syntax''' encompasses a set of theories and techniques for the analysis of spatial configurations. It was conceived by [[Bill Hillier]], [[Julienne Hanson]] and colleagues at [[The Bartlett]], [[University College London]] in the late 1970s to early 1980s as a tool to help urban planners simulate the likely social effects of their designs.

==Thesis==
The general idea is that spaces can be broken down into components, analyzed as networks of choices, then represented as maps and graphs that describe the relative connectivity and integration of those spaces. It rests on three basic conceptions of space:
*  an '''[[isovist]]''' (popularised by [[Michael Benedikt (urbanist)|Michael Benedikt]] at [[University of Texas]]), or viewshed or visibility polygon, the field of view from any particular point
*  '''axial space''' (idea popularized by Bill Hillier at UCL), a straight sight-line and possible path
*  '''convex space''' (popularized by John Peponis, and his collaborators at Georgia Tech), an occupiable void where, if imagined as a wireframe diagram, no line between two of its points goes outside its perimeter: all points within the polygon are visible to all other points within the polygon.

The three most popular ways of analysing a street network are '''Integration''', '''Choice''' and '''Depth Distance'''.
*  '''Integration''' measures how many turns have to be made from a street segment to reach all other street segments in the network, using shortest paths. If the number of turns required for reaching all segments in the graph is analyzed, the analysis is said to measure integration at radius 'n'. The first intersecting segment requires only one turn, the second two turns and so on. The street segments that require the fewest turns to reach all other streets are called 'most integrated' and are usually represented with hotter colors, such as red or yellow. Integration can also be analyzed in local scale instead of the scale of the whole network. In the case of radius 4, for instance, only four turns are counted departing from each street segment.

Theoretically, the integration measure shows the cognitive complexity of reaching a street, and is often argued to 'predict' the pedestrian use of a street: the easier it is to reach a street, the more popular it should be. While there is some evidence of this being true, the method is biased towards long, straight streets that intersect with lots of other streets. Such streets, as [[Oxford Street]] in London, come out as especially strongly integrated. However, a slightly curvy street of the same length would typically be segmented into individual straight segments, not counted as a single line, which makes curvy streets appear less integrated in the analysis.

*  The '''Choice''' measure is easiest to understand as a 'water-flow' in the street network. Imagine that each street segment is given an initial load of one unit of water, which then starts pours from the starting street segment to all segments that successively connect to it. Each time an intersection appears, the remaining value of flow is divided equally amongst the splitting streets, until all the other street segments in the graph are reached. For instance, at the first intersection with a single other street, the initial value of one is split into two remaining values of one half, and allocated to the two intersecting street segments. Moving further down, the remaining one half value is again split among the intersecting streets and so on. When the same procedure has been conducted using each segment as a starting point for the initial value of one, a graph of final values appears. The streets with the highest total values of accumulated flow are said to have the highest choice values.

Like Integration, Choice analysis can be restricted to limited local radii, for instance 400m, 800m, 1600m. Interpreting Choice analysis is trickier than Integration. Space syntax argues that these values often predict the car traffic flow of streets, but, strictly speaking, Choice analysis can also be thought to represent the number of intersections that need to be crossed to reach a street. However, since flow values are divided (not subtracted) at each intersection, the output shows an exponential distribution. It is considered best to take a log of base two of the final values in order to get a more accurate picture.

*  '''Depth Distance''' is the most intuitive of the analysis methods. It explains the linear distance from the center point of each street segment to the center points of all the other segments. If every segment is successively chosen as a starting point, a graph of accumulative final values is achieved. The streets with lowest Depth Distance values are said to be nearest to all the other streets. Again, the search radius can be limited to any distance.

===Applications===
From these components it is thought to be possible to quantify and describe how easily navigable any space is, useful for the design of museums, airports, hospitals, and other settings where [[wayfinding]] is a significant issue. Space syntax has also been applied to predict the correlation between spatial layouts and social effects such as crime, traffic flow, and [[sales per unit area]].

==History==
Space syntax originated as a programme research in the early 1970's when Bill Hillier, Adrian Leaman and Alan Beattie came together at the School of Environmental Studies at UCL (now known as the Bartlett). Bill Hillier had been appointed Director of the Unit for Architectural Studies (UAS) as successor to John Musgrove. They established a new MSc programme in Advanced Architectural Studies and embarked on a programme of research aimed at developing a theoretical basis for architecture. Previously Bill Hillier had written papers with others as secretary to the RIBA, notably 'Knowledge and Design' and 'How is Design Possible'. These laid the theoretical foundation for a series of studies that sought to clarify how the built environment relates to society. One of the first cohort of students on the MScAAS was Julienne Hanson who went on to co-author The Social Logic of Space (SLS) with Bill Hillier (CUP, 1984). This brought together in one place a comprehensive review of the programme of research up to that point, but also developed a full theoretical account for how the buildings and settlements we construct an not merely the product of social processes, but also play a role in producing social forms. SLS also developed an analytic approach to representation and quantification of spatial configuration at the building and the settlement scale, making possible both comparative studies as well as analysis of the relationship between spatial configuration and aspect of social function in the built environment. These methods coupled to the social theories have turned out to have a good deal of explanatory power. Space syntax has grown to become a tool used around the world in a variety of research areas and design applications in [[architecture]], [[urban design]], planning, [[transport]] and [[interior design]]. In general, the analysis uses one of many [[Spatial network analysis software|software programs]] that allow researchers to analyse graphs of one (or more) of the primary spatial components.

Over the past decade, Space syntax techniques have been used for research in [[archaeology]], [[information technology]], urban and human [[geography]], and [[anthropology]]. Since 1997, the Space syntax community has held biennial conferences, and many journal papers have been published on the subject, chiefly in [http://www.envplan.com Environment and Planning B].

==Criticism==
Space syntax's mathematical reliability has come under scrutiny because of a seeming paradox that arises under certain geometric configurations with 'axial maps', one of the method's primary representations of spatial configuration. This paradox was proposed by [[Carlo Ratti]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], but comprehensively refuted in a passionate academic exchange with Bill Hillier and Alan Penn [2004]. There have been moves to combine space syntax with more traditional [[transport engineering]] models, using intersections as nodes and constructing [[visibility graph]]s to link them, by researchers including [[Bin Jiang]], Valerio Cutini and [[Michael Batty]]. Recently there has also been research development that combines space syntax with geographic accessibility analysis in [[Geographic Information System|GIS]], such as the [[place syntax]]-models developed by the research group [[Spatial Analysis]] and Design at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. A series of [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437106001282; http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/b32045 interdisciplinary works] published from 2006 by [http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~latora/ Vito Latora], [https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/portasergioprof/ Sergio Porta] and colleagues, proposing a network approach to [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-84996-396-1_6 street centrality analysis] and [http://www.placelogic.org.uk design], have highlighted Space Syntax' contribution to decades of previous studies in [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037015730500462X the physics of spatial complex networks].

'''Systems biomedicine''', also called '''systems biomedical science''',&lt;ref&gt;Systems approaches to biomedical science doctoral training programme at the University of Oxford in the UK. Their website: http://www.sabscdt.ox.ac.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; is the application of [[systems biology]] to the understanding and modulation of developmental and pathological processes in humans, and in animal and cellular models. Whereas systems biology aims at modeling exhaustive networks of interactions&lt;ref&gt;Uri Alon, An Introduction to Systems Biology - Design Principles of Biological Circuits, CRC Press, 3rd printing (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; (with the long-term goal of, for example, creating a comprehensive [[computational model]] of the cell), mainly at intra-cellular level, systems biomedicine emphasizes the multilevel, hierarchical nature of the models ([[molecule]], [[organelle]], [[cell (biology)|cell]], [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], [[organ (anatomy)|organ]], individual/[[genotype]], [[environmental factor]], [[population]], [[ecosystem]]) by discovering and selecting the key factors at each level and integrating them into models that reveal the global, [[emergence|emergent behavior]] of the biological process under consideration.

Such an approach will be favorable when the execution of all the experiments necessary to establish exhaustive models is limited by time and expense (e.g., in animal models) or basic ethics (e.g., human experimentation).

In the year of 1992, a paper on system biomedicine by Kamada T. was published (Nov.-Dec.), and an article on systems medicine and pharmacology by Zeng B.J. was also published (April) in the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;Zeng (B.) J., On the holographic model of human body, 1st National Conference of Comparative
Studies Traditional Chinese Medicine and West Medicine, Medicine and Philosophy, April, 1992 ( termed "systems medicine and pharmacology").&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, the first collective book on systems biomedicine was edited by Edison T. Liu and Douglas A. Lauffenburger.&lt;ref&gt;Edison T. Liu and Douglas A. Lauffenburger, Systems Biomedicine: Concepts and Perspectives, Academic Press (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, one of the first research groups uniquely devoted to systems biomedicine was established at the [[European Institute of Oncology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifom-ieo-campus.it/research/donofrio.php IFOM-IEO Campus::Research program::Alberto d'Onofrio::Systems Biomedicine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first research centers specialized on systems biomedicine was founded by [[Rudi Balling]]. The [http://wwwde.uni.lu/lcsb Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine] is an interdisciplinary center of the [http://wwwen.uni.lu/ University of Luxembourg]. The first centre devoted to spatial issues in systems biomedicine has been recently established&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/basic-science-departments/biomedical-engineering/spatial-systems-biomedicine/about.cfm Center for Spatial Systems Biomedicine -About&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Oregon Health and Science University]].

The first peer-reviewed journal on this topic, [http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/systemsbiomedicine/ Systems Biomedicine], was recently established by [[Landes Bioscience]].

== Required skills ==
A system integration engineer needs a broad range of skills and is likely to be defined by a breadth of knowledge rather than a depth of knowledge.  These skills are likely to include [[software architecture|software]], [[systems architecture|systems]] and [[enterprise architecture|enterprise]] architecture, [[software engineering|software]] and [[hardware engineering|hardware]] engineering, [[Protocol (computing)|interface protocols]], and general problem solving skills. It is likely that the problems to be solved have not been solved before except in the broadest sense. They are likely to include new and challenging problems with an input from a broad range of engineers where the system integration engineer "pulls it all together."&lt;ref name="BUPT"&gt;{{Citation |title=An Introduction to School of Information Engineering, Information Engineering Program|publisher=Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications|location=Beijing }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance technology Integration==

Systems integrators generally have to be good at matching clients needs with existing products. An [[inductive reasoning aptitude]] is useful for quickly understanding how to operate a system or a [[Graphical user interface|GUI]]. A systems integrator will tend to benefit from being a generalist, knowing a lot about a large number of products. Systems integration includes a substantial amount of diagnostic and troubleshooting work. The ability to research existing products and software components is also helpful. Creation of these information systems may include designing or building customized vehicle prototypes or concepts for future investors and sponsors for a good model or example of the revamped  integrations to come - [[Hybrid Technology]], [[Electric]]{{dn|date=September 2017}}, [[Turbocharged]], [[Svt]]{{dn|date=September 2017}}, [[McLaren]], Greenwood, [[Ac shnitzer]],[are some of the specialized teams of Factory/Performance integration that drives auto designers to stay competitive and keep the cutting edge feel in any Brand from Dodge to Pagani there are areas for improvement that can only be tweaked and twisted to stay a cut above the rest and maintain the physical appearance of the specialty teams trademark modifications.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

==In the defense industry==

In the defense industry, the job of 'Systems Integration' engineer is growing in importance as defense systems become more 'connected'.  As well as integrating new systems, the task of integrating current systems is attracting a lot of research and effort.  It is only in recent years that systems have started to be deployed that can interconnect with each other; most systems were designed as 'stovepipe' designs with no thought to future connectivity.

The current problem is how to harness all the information available, from the various information generators (or sensors) into one complete picture.

As well as the design of the actual interfaces much effort is being put into presenting the information in a useful manner.  The level of information, needed by the different levels in the military structure, and the relevance of the information (information can become outdated in seconds) is so variable that it may be necessary to have more than one system connected.

Another problem is how information is networked.  The Internet may seem to be an obvious solution, but it is vulnerable to [[denial of service]] and physical destruction of the key 'hubs'.  One answer is to use a dedicated military communication system, but the [[Throughput|bandwidth]] needed would be astronomical in such a system.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Army [[Warrant Officer (United States)]] military occupational specialty (MOS) 140A - Command and Control Systems Technician is an example of a systems integrator in the defense industry.
140A Warrant Officers assigned to Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) integrate systems with multiple [[operating systems]] (OS) and hardware configurations – that include: 
[[UNIX]], [[Linux]] &amp; [[Microsoft Windows]]
Others can fill a similar role at the Division level and higher.

==In Entertainment and architectural controls==

In entertainment and architectural installations, systems integrators function as a designer/engineer, bringing together a wide array of components from various manufacturers to accomplish the goal of creating a unified, functioning system that meets the needs of the client.  Systems Integrators are usually involved in the selection of instruments and control components from among various [[OEMs]] to determine the specific mix of output, function, interconnection, program storage, controls, and user interfaces required for specific projects.  The integrator is generally responsible for generating the control riser, collaborating with the lighting consultant/ AV consultant on the function programming, and will commission the system once installed.  Often (but not always) the system integrator will also be the vendor for projects they are commissioning, and will collaborate with the lighting designer on the artistic design.  As lighting and A/V systems increase in their level of sophistication, and the number of manufacturers for components of these systems increases, so does the demand for systems integrators.
 
Common data protocols involved in entertainment and architectural systems are [[DMX512-A|Digital Multiplexing (or DMX512-A)]], [[RDM (lighting)|Remote Device Management (or RDM)]], [[Art-Net]], [[Architecture for Control Networks|ACN]] or sACN (Streaming Architecture for Control Networks), Analog, and various proprietary control software from a variety of manufacturers.  Systems Integrators design many distributed nodes in traditional star or ring topologies, or customize system layout for specific installations.  The network will have a hierarchy of main and sub-control stations with varying degrees of access.  The network can be designed such that the controls for this system can be on an established timeline, or controlled in real time by astronomical clocks, audio/motion/IR sensors, or various means of user interface (buttons, touch-pads, consoles).  This system might utilize a primary controller that can access the entire system, and satellite control interfaces linked via a network backbone that would determine functionality based on access codes.  For example, a casino might use a networked system that interfaces with architectural lighting, stage lighting, special effects (such as fog machines or fountains), and media content routed to a media server.  The primary controller would have access to all devices on the network, while individual control stations could have varying levels of functionality.  A ballroom might have a multi-button panel that would adjust lighting only in that ballroom, while a cabaret space with a stage would require an access code that would give employees access to the stage lighting, while the IT manager could use the same panel to access the main controls for the networks.

== In the automation industry ==
{{main article|Automation integrator}}
System Integrators in the automation industry typically provide the product and application experience in implementing complex automation solutions.  Often, System Integrators are aligned with automation vendors, joining their various System Integrator programs for access to development products, resources and technical support.  System integrators are tightly linked to their accounts and often are viewed as the engineering departments for small manufacturers, handling their automation system installation, commissioning and long term maintenance.

'''Tiling arrays''' are a subtype of [[DNA microarray|microarray]] chips. Like traditional microarrays, they function by [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridizing]] labeled [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] target molecules to probes fixed onto a solid surface.

Tiling arrays differ from traditional microarrays in the nature of the probes. Instead of probing for [[Nucleic acid sequence|sequences]] of known or predicted genes that may be dispersed throughout the [[genome]], tiling arrays probe intensively for sequences which are known to exist in a contiguous region. This is useful for characterizing regions that are sequenced, but whose local functions are largely unknown. Tiling arrays aid in [[transcriptome]] mapping as well as in discovering sites of DNA/[[protein]] interaction ([[ChIP-on-chip|ChIP-chip]], [[DamID]]), of DNA [[methylation]] (MeDIP-chip) and of sensitivity to DNase (DNase Chip) and array CGH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yazaki|first=J |author2=Gregory, BD |author3=Ecker, JR|title=Mapping the genome landscape using tiling array technology.|journal=Current Opinion in Plant Biology|date=October 2007|volume=10|issue=5|pages=534–42|pmid=17703988 |doi=10.1016/j.pbi.2007.07.006|pmc=2665186}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to detecting previously unidentified genes and regulatory sequences, improved quantification of transcription products is possible. Specific probes are present in millions of copies (as opposed to only several in traditional arrays) within an array unit called a feature, with anywhere from 10,000 to more than 6,000,000 different features per array.&lt;ref name="Moc05"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mockler|first=TC|author2=Chan, S |author3=Sundaresan, A |author4=Chen, H |author5=Jacobsen, SE |author6=Ecker, JR |title=Applications of DNA tiling arrays for whole-genome analysis.|journal=Genomics|date=January 2005|volume=85|issue=1|pages=1–15|pmid=15607417| doi = 10.1016/j.ygeno.2004.10.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Variable mapping resolutions are obtainable by adjusting the amount of sequence overlap between probes, or the amount of known [[base pair]]s between probe sequences, as well as probe length. For smaller genomes such as ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana|Arabidopsis]]'', whole genomes can be examined.&lt;ref name="Yamada 842–6"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yamada|first=K |author2=Lim, J |author3=Dale, JM |author4=Chen, H |author5=Shinn, P |author6=Palm, CJ |author7=Southwick, AM |author8=Wu, HC |author9=Kim, C |author10=Nguyen, M |author11=Pham, P |author12=Cheuk, R|title=Empirical analysis of transcriptional activity in the Arabidopsis genome.|journal=Science|date=Oct 31, 2003|volume=302|issue=5646|pages=842–6|pmid=14593172|doi=10.1126/science.1088305|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiling arrays are a useful tool in [[genome-wide association study|genome-wide association studies]].

== Synthesis and manufacturers ==
The two main ways of synthesizing tiling arrays are [[photolithographic]] manufacturing and mechanical spotting or printing.

The first method involves ''[[in situ]]'' synthesis where probes, approximately 25bp, are built on the surface of the chip. These arrays can hold up to 6 million discrete features, each of which contains millions of copies of one probe.

The other way of synthesizing tiling array chips is via mechanically printing probes onto the chip. This is done by using automated machines with pins that place the previously synthesized probes onto the surface. Due to the size restriction of the pins, these chips can hold up to nearly 400,000 features.&lt;ref name="Liu 1842–4"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=XS|title=Getting started in tiling microarray analysis.|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|date=October 2007|volume=3|issue=10|pages=1842–4|pmid=17967045 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030183|pmc=2041964}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Three manufacturers of tiling arrays are [[Affymetrix]], [[NimbleGen]] and [[Agilent]]. Their products vary in probe length and spacing. ArrayExplorer.com is a free web-server to compare tiling arrays.

== Applications and types ==
[[Image:chromatin fig 2.png|thumb|250px|Overview of ChIP-chip procedure.]]

=== ChIP-chip ===
{{main|ChIP-on-chip}}
ChIP-chip is one of the most popular usages of tiling arrays. [[Chromatin immunoprecipitation]] allows binding sites of [[proteins]] to be identified. A genome-wide variation of this is known as ChIP-on-chip. Proteins that bind to [[chromatin]] are cross-linked [[in vivo]], usually via fixation with [[formaldehyde]]. The chromatin is then fragmented and exposed to [[antibodies]] specific to the protein of interest. These complexes are then precipitated. The DNA is then isolated and purified. With traditional DNA microarrays, the immunoprecipitated DNA is hybridized to the chip, which contains probes that are designed to cover representative genome regions. Overlapping probes or probes in very close proximity can be used. This gives an unbiased analysis with high resolution. Besides these advantages, tiling arrays show high reproducibility and with overlapping probes spanning large segments of the genome, tiling arrays can interrogate protein binding sites, which harbor repeats. ChIP-chip experiments have been able to identify binding sites of transcription factors across the genome in yeast, drosophila and a few mammalian species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Geen|first=H |author2=Squazzo, SL |author3=Iyengar, S |author4=Blahnik, K |author5=Rinn, JL |author6=Chang, HY |author7=Green, R |author8=Farnham, PJ|title=Genome-wide analysis of KAP1 binding suggests autoregulation of KRAB-ZNFs.|journal=PLOS Genetics|date=June 2007|volume=3|issue=6|pages=e89|pmid=17542650 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030089|pmc=1885280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:transcriptome fig 3.png|thumb|left|235px|Overview of transcriptome mapping procedure.]]

=== Transcriptome mapping ===
Another popular use of tiling arrays is in finding expressed genes. Traditional methods of gene prediction for annotation of genomic sequences have had problems when used to map the transcriptome, such as not producing an accurate structure of the genes and also missing transcripts entirely. The method of sequencing cDNA to find transcribed genes also runs into problems, such as failing to detect rare or very short RNA molecules, and so do not detect genes that are active only in response to signals or specific to a time frame. Tiling arrays can solve these issues. Due to the high resolution and sensitivity, even small and rare molecules can be detected. The overlapping nature of the probes also allows detection of non-polyadenylated RNA and can produce a more precise picture of gene structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bertone|first=P|author2=Gerstein, M |author3=Snyder, M |title=Applications of DNA tiling arrays to experimental genome annotation and regulatory pathway discovery.|journal=Chromosome research : an international journal on the molecular, supramolecular and evolutionary aspects of chromosome biology|year=2005|volume=13|issue=3|pages=259–74|pmid=15868420|doi=10.1007/s10577-005-2165-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier studies on chromosome 21 and 22 showed the power of tiling arrays for identifying transcription units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cawley|first=S|author2=Bekiranov, S |author3=Ng, HH |author4=Kapranov, P |author5=Sekinger, EA |author6=Kampa, D |author7=Piccolboni, A |author8=Sementchenko, V |author9=Cheng, J |author10=Williams, AJ |author11=Wheeler, R |author12=Wong, B |author13=Drenkow, J |author14=Yamanaka, M |author15=Patel, S |author16=Brubaker, S |author17=Tammana, H |author18=Helt, G |author19=Struhl, K |author20=Gingeras, TR|title=Unbiased mapping of transcription factor binding sites along human chromosomes 21 and 22 points to widespread regulation of noncoding RNAs.|journal=Cell|date=Feb 20, 2004|volume=116|issue=4|pages=499–509|pmid=14980218|doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00127-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kapranov|first=P |author2=Cawley, SE |author3=Drenkow, J |author4=Bekiranov, S |author5=Strausberg, RL |author6=Fodor, SP |author7=Gingeras, TR|title=Large-scale transcriptional activity in chromosomes 21 and 22.|journal=Science|date=May 3, 2002|volume=296|issue=5569|pages=916–9|pmid=11988577|doi=10.1126/science.1068597}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kam04"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kampa|first=D |author2=Cheng, J |author3=Kapranov, P |author4=Yamanaka, M |author5=Brubaker, S |author6=Cawley, S |author7=Drenkow, J |author8=Piccolboni, A |author9=Bekiranov, S |author10=Helt, G |author11=Tammana, H |author12=Gingeras, TR|title=Novel RNAs identified from an in-depth analysis of the transcriptome of human chromosomes 21 and 22.|journal=Genome Research|date=March 2004|volume=14|issue=3|pages=331–42|pmid=14993201 |doi=10.1101/gr.2094104|pmc=353210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors used 25-mer probes that were 35bp apart, spanning the entire chromosomes. Labeled targets were made from polyadenylated RNA. They found many more transcripts than predicted and 90% were outside of annotated [[exon]]s. Another study with Arabidopsis used high-density [[oligonucleotide]] arrays that cover the entire genome. More than 10 times more transcripts were found than predicted by ESTs{{clarify|date=September 2012}} and other prediction tools.&lt;ref name="Yamada 842–6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stolc|first=V |author2=Samanta, MP |author3=Tongprasit, W |author4=Sethi, H |author5=Liang, S |author6=Nelson, DC |author7=Hegeman, A |author8=Nelson, C |author9=Rancour, D |author10=Bednarek, S |author11=Ulrich, EL |author12=Zhao, Q |author13=Wrobel, RL |author14=Newman, CS |author15=Fox, BG |author16=Phillips, GN Jr |author17=Markley, JL |author18=Sussman, MR |title=Identification of transcribed sequences in Arabidopsis thaliana by using high-resolution genome tiling arrays.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Mar 22, 2005|volume=102|issue=12|pages=4453–8|pmid=15755812 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0408203102|pmc=555476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also found were novel transcripts in the [[centromere|centromeric]] regions where it was thought that no genes are actively expressed.  Many noncoding and natural [[antisense RNA]] have been identified using tiling arrays.&lt;ref name="Kam04" /&gt;

[[Image:ChIP fig 4.png|thumb|250px|Overview of MeDIP-chip procedure.]]

=== MeDIP-chip ===
Methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation followed by tiling array allows DNA methylation mapping and measurement across the genome. DNA is methylated on [[cytosine]] in CG di-nucleotides in many places in the genome. This modification is one of the best-understood inherited [[epigenetic]] changes and is shown to affect gene expression. Mapping these sites can add to the knowledge of expressed genes and also epigenetic regulation on a genome-wide level. Tiling array studies have generated high-resolution methylation maps for the Arabidopsis genome to generate the first "methylome".

[[Image:Nucleosome fig 5.png|thumb|left|235px|Overview of DNase-chip procedure.]]

=== DNase-chip ===
DNase chip is an application of tiling arrays to identify hypersensitive sites, segments of open chromatin that are more readily cleaved by DNaseI. DNaseI cleaving produces larger fragments of around 1.2kb in size. These hypersensitive sites have been shown to accurately predict regulatory elements such as promoter regions, enhancers and silencers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crawford|first=GE|author2=Davis, S |author3=Scacheri, PC |author4=Renaud, G |author5=Halawi, MJ |author6=Erdos, MR |author7=Green, R |author8=Meltzer, PS |author9=Wolfsberg, TG |author10=Collins, FS |title=DNase-chip: a high-resolution method to identify DNase I hypersensitive sites using tiled microarrays.|journal=Nature Methods|date=July 2006|volume=3|issue=7|pages=503–9|pmid=16791207|doi=10.1038/nmeth888 |pmc=2698431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the method uses Southern blotting to find digested fragments. Tiling arrays have allowed researchers to apply the technique on a genome-wide scale.

=== Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) ===
Array-based CGH is a technique often used in diagnostics to compare differences between types of DNA, such as normal cells vs. cancer cells. Two types of tiling arrays are commonly used for array CGH, whole genome and fine tiled. The whole genome approach would be useful in identifying copy number variations with high resolution. On the other hand, fine-tiled array CGH would produce ultrahigh resolution to find other abnormalities such as breakpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heidenblad|first=M|author2=Lindgren, D |author3=Jonson, T |author4=Liedberg, F |author5=Veerla, S |author6=Chebil, G |author7=Gudjonsson, S |author8=Borg, A |author9=Månsson, W |author10=Höglund, M |title=Tiling resolution array CGH and high density expression profiling of urothelial carcinomas delineate genomic amplicons and candidate target genes specific for advanced tumors.|journal=BMC Medical Genomics|date=Jan 31, 2008|volume=1|pages=3|pmid=18237450 |doi=10.1186/1755-8794-1-3|pmc=2227947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
[[Image:flow chart fig 6.png|thumb|250px|Workflow of tiling array procedure.]]
Several different methods exist for tiling an array. One protocol for analyzing gene expression involves first isolating total RNA. This is then purified of rRNA molecules. The RNA is copied into double stranded DNA, which is subsequently amplified and in vitro transcribed to cRNA. The product is split into triplicates to produce dsDNA, which is then fragmented and labeled. Finally, the samples are hybridized to the tiling array chip. The signals from the chip are scanned and interpreted by computers.

Various software and algorithms are available for data analysis and vary in benefits depending on the manufacturer of the chip. For Affymetrix chips, the model-based analysis of tiling array (MAT) or hypergeometric analysis of tiling-arrays (HAT&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taskesen|first=Erdogan |author2=Beekman, R |author3=de Ridder, J |author4=Wouters, BJ |author5=Peeters, JK |author6=Touw, IP |author7=Reinders, MJ |author8=Delwel, R |title=HAT: hypergeometric analysis of tiling-arrays with application to promoter-GeneChip data.|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|date=May 21, 2010|volume=11|pages=275|pmid=20492700|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-11-275|pmc=2892465}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are effective peak-seeking algorithms. For NimbleGen chips, TAMAL is more suitable for locating binding sites. Alternative algorithms include MA2C and TileScope, which are less complicated to operate. The Joint binding deconvolution algorithm is commonly used for Agilent chips. If sequence analysis of binding site or annotation of the genome is required then programs like MEME, Gibbs Motif Sampler, Cis-regulatory element annotation system and [[Galaxy (computational biology)|Galaxy]] are used.&lt;ref name="Liu 1842–4"/&gt;

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

Tiling arrays provide an unbiased tool to investigate protein binding, gene expression and gene structure on a genome-wide scope. They allow a new level of insight in studying the transcriptome and methylome.

Drawbacks include the cost of tiling array kits. Although prices have fallen in the last several years, the price makes it impractical to use genome-wide tiling arrays for mammalian and other large genomes. Another issue is the "transcriptional noise" produced by its ultra-sensitive detection capability.&lt;ref name="Moc05" /&gt; Furthermore, the approach provides no clearly defined start or stop to regions of interest identified by the array. Finally, arrays usually give only chromosome and position numbers, often necessitating sequencing as a separate step (although some modern arrays do give sequence information.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}})

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women in journalism''' are individuals who participate in [[journalism]]. As journalism became a [[professionalization|profession]], women were restricted by custom from access to journalism occupations, and faced significant discrimination within the profession.  Nevertheless, women operated as editors, reporters, sports analysts and journalists even before the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Brown, "The Emergence of Females as Professional Journalists," HistoryReference.org [http://www.historyreference.org/library/refwomen.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Currently==

In 2017, with the [[#MeToo]] movement, a number of notable female journalists came forward to report sexual harassment in their workplaces.&lt;ref name="2017-December-Vox"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/18/16780424/women-journalism-career-harassment|title=When harassment drives women out of journalism|date=December 18, 2017|website= [[Vox Media|Vox]]|access-date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lauren Wolfe, an investigative journalist and the director of the Women's Media Center's Women Under Siege program, female journalists face particular risks over their male colleagues, and are more likely to experience [[online harassment]] or [[sexual assault]] on the job.&lt;ref name="2017-December-TI"/&gt;

According to a report released on December 20, 2017 by the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], in 2017, 42 journalists were killed because of their work worldwide, with 81 percent of those journalists male. This was slightly lower than the historical average of 93 percent of men journalists killed annually for their work, with ''[[The Intercept]]'' theorizing that the drop was perhaps due to women being assigned more frequently to dangerous locales.&lt;ref name="2017-December-TI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2017/12/21/an-unusually-deadly-year-for-women-journalists-around-the-world-report-finds/|title=An Unusually Deadly Year for Women Journalists Around the World, Report Finds |date=December 20, 2017|website= [[The Intercept]]|access-date=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
{{Main|Safety of Journalists}}
'''Safety of journalists''' is the ability for [[journalist]]s and media professionals to receive, produce and share information without facing physical or moral threats. Women journalists also face increasing dangers such as sexual assault, "whether in the  form  of  a  targeted  sexual  violation,  often  in  reprisal  for  their  work;  mob-related sexual violence aimed against journalists covering public events; or the sexual abuse of journalists in detention or captivity. Many of these crimes are not reported as a result of powerful cultural and professional stigmas."&lt;ref&gt;The United Nations Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and Issues of Impunity, 2012, https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/un-plan-on-safety-journalists_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends Report in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002610/261065e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Threats ===
Women journalists, whether they are working in an insecure context, or in a [[newsroom]], face risks of physical assault, [[sexual harassment]], [[sexual assault]], [[rape]] and even murder. They are vulnerable to attacks not only from those attempting to silence their coverage, but also from sources, colleagues and others.&lt;ref&gt;Lanza, Edison. 2017.

Available at http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/expression/docs/publications/ZONAS_SILENCIADAS_ENG.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 global survey of nearly a thousand journalists, initiated by the International News Safety Institute (INSI) in partnership with the [[International Women's Media Foundation|International Women's Media Foundation]] (IWMF) and with the support of UNESCO, found that nearly two-thirds of women who took part in the survey had experienced intimidation, threats or abuse in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;International Media Women’s Foundation and International News Safety Institute 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period from 2012 through 2016, UNESCO's Director-General denounced the killing of 38 women journalists, representing 7 per cent of all journalists killed.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/unesco-condemns-killing-of-journalists&lt;/ref&gt;  The percentage of journalists killed who are women is significantly lower than their overall representation in the media workforce. This large gender gap is likely partly the result of the persistent under-representation of women reporting from war-zones or insurgencies or on topics such as politics and crime.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Janet, Nick Mosdell, and James Griffiths. 2016. Gender, Risk and Journalism. Journalism Practice 10 (7): 902–916&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online harassment ===
Research undertaken by [[Pew Research Center]] indicated that 73 per cent of adult internet users in the [[United States]] had seen someone be harassed in some way online and 40 per cent had personally experienced it, with young women being particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment and [[stalking]].&lt;ref&gt;Duggan, Maeve, Lee Rainie, Aaron Smith, Cary Funk, Amanda Lenhart, and Mary Madden. 2014. Online Harassment. Pew Research Center. Available at http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/10/22/onlineharassment/.&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of more than two million tweets performed by the [[think tank]] [[Demos (U.S. think tank)|Demos]] found that women journalists experienced approximately three times as many abusive comments as their male counterparts on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;Demos. 2014.

[[The Guardian]] surveyed the 70 million comments recorded on its website between 1999 and 2016 (only 22,000 of which were recorded before 2006). Of these comments, approximately 1.4 million (approximately two per cent) were blocked for abusive or disruptive behavior. Of the 10 staff journalists who received the highest levels of abuse and ‘dismissive [[Internet troll|trolling]]’, eight were women.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, Becky, Mahana Mansfield, Ian Anderson, Josh Holder, Daan Louter, and Monica Ulmanu. 2016.

[[Sophia Dalton]] published the newspaper ''The Patriot'' in [[Toronto]] in 1840-48,&lt;ref&gt;I. R.

Canadian born [[Florence MacLeod Harper]] was notable for her work with photographer Donald Thompson covering both the Eastern front in World War One and the February revolution in St Petersburg 1917 for Leslie's weekly. Her subsequent books, Bloostained Russia and 'Runaway Russia', were some of the first Western accounts of events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alexanderpalace.org/thompson/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
In Denmark, women became editors early on by inheriting papers form their spouses, the earliest examples being [[Sophie Morsing]], who inherited ''Wochenliche Zeitung'' from her husband in 1658 and managed the paper as editor, and Catherine Hake, who inherited the paper ''Europäische Wochentliche Zeitung'' as widow the following year – as far as it is known, though, these women did not write in their papers.&lt;ref&gt;John Chr. Jørgensen: Da kvinderne blev journalister. Københavns Universitet. Det Humanistiske Fakultet. Københavns Universitet. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The first woman in Denmark who published articles in Danish papers were the writer [[Charlotte Baden]], who occasionally participated in the weekly ''MorgenPost'' from 1786 to 1793.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;John Chr. Jørgensen:Da kvinderne blev journalister. Københavns Universitet. Det Humanistiske Fakultet. Københavns Universitet. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1845, Marie Arnesen became the first woman to participate in the public political debate in a Danish newspaper, and from the 1850s, it became common for women to participate in public debate or contribute with an occasional article: among them being [[Caroline Testman]], who wrote travel articles, and [[Athalia Schwartz]], who was a well known public media figure through her participation in the debate in the papers between 1849 and 1871.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In the 1870s, the women's movement started and published papers of their own, with women editors and journalists.

It was not until the 1880s, however, that women begun to be professionally active in the Danish press, and [[Sofie Horten]] (1848–1927) likely became the first woman who supported herself as a professional journalist when she was employed at ''Sorø Amtstidende'' in 1888.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; An important pioneer was [[Loulou Lassen]], employed at the ''[[Politiken]]'' in 1910, the first female career journalist and a pioneer female journalist within science, also arguably the first nationally well known woman in the profession. In 1912, eight women were members of the reporter's union ''[[Københavns Journalistforbund]]'' (Copenhagen Association of Journalists), five in the club ''Journalistforeningen i København'' (Journalist Association of Copenhagen) and a total of 35 women employed as journalists in Denmark.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Finland===

The Swedish journalist and editor [[Catharina Ahlgren]] was most likely the first female journalist and editor in the then Swedish province of Finland when she published her own essay paper, the Swedish language ''Om att rätt behaga'' in 1782, which was also among the very first papers in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;Henrika Zilliacus-Tikkanen: När könet började skriva – Kvinnor i finländsk press 1771–1900 (English: When gender started to write – women in Finnish media 1771–1900)&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the first female journalist has been referred to as [[Fredrika Runeberg]], who wrote poems and articles in ''[[Helsingfors Morgonblad]]'' under the name of her spouse [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg]] in the 1830s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The first woman in Finland to work as a journalist in Finland under her own name was [[Adelaïde Ehrnrooth]], who wrote in ''[[Helsingfors Dagblad]]'' and ''[[Hufvudstadsbladet]]'' for 35 years from 1869 onward.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===France===
[[Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer]] (1663–1719) has been referred to as one of the most famous early 18th century female journalists in Europe. Her reports of the negotiations leading to the [[Peace of Utrecht]] were read all over Europe and admired for the distinction with which she reported on scandal and gossip.&lt;ref&gt;Regine Reynolds-Cornell: Fiction and reality in the Mémoires of the notorious Anne-Marguerite Petit DuNoyer (Tübingen: Narr 1999). {{ISBN|3-8233-5527-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
The first female journalist in Norway was [[Birgithe Kühle]], who published the local paper ''Provincial-Lecture'' in [[Bergen]] between 1794 and 1795.&lt;ref&gt;Bra böckers världshistoria / [chefredaktör: Kenneth Åström ; redaktion: Gil Dahlström ...]. Bd 10, Två revolutioner : 1750–1815 / av Kåre Tønnesson ; [översättning: Ingrid Emond ...] Malmö Bra Böcker 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th-century, women participated with articles in the press, especially within the culture sections and a translators, notably [[Magdalene Thoresen]], who has by some been referred to as an early female journalist: from 1856, [[Marie Colban]] (1814–1884) lived in Paris, from where she wrote articles for ''[[Morgenbladet]]'' and ''[[Illustreret Nyhedsblad]]'', for which she can be regarded as the first female foreign correspondent in the Norwegian press.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Other pioneers were [[Wilhelmine Gulowsen]], editor of the culture paper ''Figaro'' in 1882–83, and [[Elisabeth Schøyen]], editor of the family magazine ''Familie-Musæum'' in 1878 and journalist of ''[[Bergensposten]]'' and ''[[Aftenposten]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Schøyen. (2009, 14. februar). I Store norske leksikon. Hentet 16. November 2015 fra https://snl.no/Elisabeth_Sch%C3%B8yen.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norwegian newspaper press in the capital of [[Oslo]] had their first two female reporters with [[Marie Mathisen]] in ''[[Dagsposten]]'' in 1897, and [[Anna Hvoslef]] in ''[[Aftenposten]]'' in 1898: the former became the first female member of the [[Oslo Journalistklubb]] (Oslo Journalist Association) in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Kvaale, Reidun: Kvinner i norsk presse gjennom 150 år. Gyldendal Norsk Forlag, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
[[File:Beata Chmielowska-Olech beax.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Polish television news anchor Beata Chmielowska-Olech, 2007]]
In 1822, [[Wanda Malecka]] (1800–1860) became the first woman newspaper publisher in Poland when she published the ''Bronisława'' (followed in 1826–31 by the ''Wybór romansów''); she had in 1818-20 previously been the editor of the handwritten publication ''Domownik'', and was also a pioneer woman journalist, publishing articles in ''Wanda''.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Rogalski, Historya literatury Polskiéj, Volume 2, Nakładem Michała Glücksberga, księgarza, 1871. pp. 590–591&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
[[File:Wendela Hebbe.jpg|thumb|[[Wendela Hebbe]], drawing by [[Maria Röhl]] 1842.]]
In Sweden, [[Maria Matras]], known as "N. Wankijfs Enka", published the paper ''Ordinarie Stockholmiske Posttijdender'' in 1690–1695, but it is unknown if she wrote in the paper as well.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Berger, Margareta, Pennskaft: kvinnliga journalister i svensk dagspress 1690–1975 [Penholders: Female journalists in Swedish press 1690–1975], Norstedt, Stockholm, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margareta Momma]] became the first identified female journalist and [[chief editor]] as the editor of the political essaypaper ''[[Samtal emellan Argi Skugga och en obekant Fruentimbers Skugga]]'' in 1738.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Öhrberg, Vittra fruntimmer. Författarroll och retorik hos frihetstidens kvinnliga författare (Uppsala 2001) 165–187, 339–345.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th-century, many periodicals for, about, and likely also by women were published, but as women normally published under pseudonym, the can seldom be identified: one of the few identified ones being [[Catharina Ahlgren]], who edited the typical women's periodical ''[[De nymodiga fruntimren]]'' (Modern Women) in 1773.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Margareta, Äntligen ord från qwinnohopen!: At last, words also from the women : om kvinnopress under 1700-talet, Akademilitt., Stockholm, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Women chief editors became fairly common during the 18th-century when the press in Sweden developed, especially since the widow of a male printer or editor normally took over the business of her late spouse: a successful and well known female newspaper editor was [[Anna Hammar-Rosén]], who managed the popular newspaper ''[[Hwad Nytt?? Hwad Nytt??]]'' between 1773 and 1795.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

It was not until the 19th-century that the papers of the Swedish press started to introduce a permanent staff of co-workers and journalists, a development which attached the first women as permanent employees to the newspaper offices, which are noted to be [[Wendela Hebbe]] at ''[[Aftonbladet]]'' in 1841–51 and [[Marie Sophie Schwartz]] at ''Svenska Tidningen Dagligt Allehanda'' in 1851–57.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In 1858, [[Louise Flodin]] came to be regarded as an important pioneer when she founded her own newspaper, became the first woman to be given a newspaper license, and composed a staff entirely of women employees,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and [[Eva Brag]] became an important pioneer during her career at ''Göteborgs Handels- och Sjöfartstidning'' in 1865–1889.&lt;ref&gt;Heggestad, Eva: Kritik och kön. 1880-talets kvinnliga kritiker och exemplet Eva Brag. Samlaren. Tidskrift för svensk litteraturvetenskaplig forskning. Årgång 115 1994. Svenska Litteratursällskapet.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1880s, women became more common in the offices of the press, and when women was admitted to the [[Swedish Publicists' Association]] in 1885, 14 women were inducted as members.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;    
The pioneer generation of women journalists were generally from the upper class who wished to earn their own income.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; At this point, the focus of a conventional education for a woman was language, which was not the case with a conventional male education, especially since the male reporters were generally not from the upper classes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Women were employed as translators and given the responsibility for the coverage of culture and foreign news and interviews of foreigners. During this period, women journalists were reportedly respected – partially due to their social background – and due to their language skills given assignments with equal status to their male co-workers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In 1918, [[Maria Cederschiöld]], first woman editor of a foreign news section, recalled that women reporters were not as controversial or discriminated in the 1880s as they would later become, "...when the results of [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]]'s hatred of women made itself known. Nor was the struggle of life and competition so sharp, as it has later become. The women pioneers were generally treated with sympathy and interest, even by the men, perhaps because they normally did not regard them as dangerous competitors."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Of the seven biggest newspapers in Stockholm, six had female co-workers prior to 1900, and when [[Swedish Union of Journalists]] was founded in 1901, women were included from the start.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; An important event occurred in 1910, when the popular novel ''Pennskaftet'' by [[Elin Wägner]] made the journalist profession a popular career choice for women, and women career journalists were often referred to as "pennskaft".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; By this time, women reporters, though a minority, had become common and no longer regarded as a novelty and the competition had become harder: in 1913, ''[[Stockholms Dagblad]]'' made a record by having seven female co-workers, and the same year, the [[Swedish Publicists' Association]] founded the ''De kvinnliga journalisternas stipendiefond'' to finance foreign trips for women reporters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Women covered [[World War I]] and the [[Russian revolution]] and several women journalists became famed role models such as [[Ester Blenda Nordström]] and [[Elin Brandell]].

During the [[Interwar period]], a change occurred which exposed women reporters to an informal discrimination long referred to as a "woman's trap": the introduction of the customary women's section of the newspapers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; During [[World War I]], war time rationing made it necessary to cover household interests, which after the war became a woman's section, as household tasks were regarded as female tasks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The coverage of the women's section customarily became the task of the women reporters, and as they were a minority, the same reporters were often forced to handle the women's section side from their other assignments, which placed them in a great disadvantage to their male colleagues when the competition became harsher during the interwar depression.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;   
In parallel, they were women with successful careers, notably [[Barbro Alving]], whose coverage of the [[Spanish civil war]], [[World War II]] and the [[Cold war]] made her famous, and Dagmar Crohn, who were the editor of the economy section at ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' in 1933–1959, which made her unique at the time.
In 1939, [[Elsa Nyblom]] became vice chairperson of the [[Publicistklubben]].

The informal discrimination changed when women reporters started to expand the subjects treated at the women's sections. A noted example of this development was [[Synnöve Bellander]], editor of the women's section ''Hus och hem'' at Svenska Dagbladet in 1932–59. Originally expected to write only of fashion and make up, she started to expand the area to the subjects of education and professional life for women, and from there to consumer issues and food quality and other issues concerning the private home life. This development in the women's sections gradually transformed them to sections for "family" and private life for both sexes, and blurred the line to the rest of the paper.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The 1960s signified a great change. A debate about gender discrimination in the press, followed by the general debate about gender roles during the 
[[second-wave feminism]], quickly raised the numbers of female reporters in the press from 1965 onward. In 1970, [[Pernilla Tunberger]] became the first woman to be awarded ''[[Stora Journalistpriset]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The first female full-time employed journalist in [[Fleet Street]] was [[Eliza Lynn Linton]], who was employed by ''[[The Morning Chronicle]]'' from 1848: three years later, she became the paper's correspondent in Paris, and upon her return to London in the 1860s, she was given a permanent position.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is regarded as the first account of war by a woman. Her writing analyzes the relevant events, personalities of key actors and consequences of the military struggles she observed. Moreover, she was personally involved in the heart of the [[Battles of Saratoga]]. She suffered the hardships of siege when she sheltered in the cellar of [[Marshall House (Schuylerville, New York)|the Marshall House]] during the [[Saratoga campaign|failed retreat of the British army]].

Beginning in the late nineteenth century, women began agitating for the right to work as professional journalists in North America and Europe; by many accounts, the first notable woman in political journalism was [[Jane Grey Swisshelm]]. A former correspondent for Horace Greeley's ''New York Tribune'', she persuaded President Millard Fillmore to open the gallery in congress so that she could report on congressional news.&lt;ref&gt;"Jane Grey Swisshelm:  A Staunch Foe of Slavery, A Noble Woman's Life's Work." San Francisco Bulletin, 2 August 1884, p. 1S.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Swisshelm, Horace Greeley had employed another noteworthy woman in journalism, [[Margaret Fuller]], who covered international news.  [[Nellie Bly]] became known for her investigative reporting at the ''New York World''. She was one of the first female journalists of her era to report by going undercover.

While many female reporters in the 1800s and early 1900s were restricted to [[society reporting]] and were expected to cover the latest in food or fashion, there were a few women who reported on subjects that were considered the domain of male reporters. One example was [[Ina Eloise Young]] (later Ina Young Kelley). In 1907, Miss Young was said to be the only female sports editor (or "sporting" editor, as it was then called). She worked in Colorado for the ''Trinidad Chronicle-News'', and her areas of expertise were baseball, football, and horse racing.&lt;ref&gt;"Colorado Has the Only Woman Sporting Editor." Washington DC Sunday Star, 29 December 1907, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; She covered the 1908 World's Series, the only woman of her time to do so.&lt;ref&gt;"World's Series Notes." Harrisburg (PA) Patriot, 15 October 1908, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 Status of Women in the U.S. Media reported that of more than 150 sports-related print publications and sports-related websites, 90 percent of editors were white males.&lt;ref name="Bedard-WE media"/&gt;

[[File:Public Domain World War II Correspondents (NARA).jpg|thumb|350px|U.S. [[World War II]] [[War correspondent|correspondents]]]]
Another example of a woman in a non-traditional media profession was [[Jennie Irene Mix]]:  when radio broadcasting became a national obsession in the early 1920s, she was one of the few female radio editors at a magazine:  a former classical pianist and a syndicated music critic who wrote about opera and classical music in the early 1920s, Miss Mix became the radio editor at ''Radio Broadcast'' magazine, a position she held from early 1924 until her sudden death in April 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Mitchell, editor. Women and Radio:  Airing Differences.

===Nepal===
The history of women in journalism in [[Nepal]] is relatively new. Nepal only enjoyed an open press after the [[People's Movement I (1990)|1990 democratic movement]]. It is only since that change that women have been more active in the scene of journalism. The number of registered women journalists under the [[Federation of Nepalese Journalists]] is 1,613.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://setopati.net/blog/15868/|title=Women in media in Nepal|work=Setopati Online|author=Bhandari, Kripa |date=18 July 2016|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
[[Hind Nawfal]] (1860–1920) was the first woman in the Arab world to publish a journal ([[Al Fatat]]) concerning only women's issues.  [[Zaynab Fawwaz]] was another prolific journalist who also founded a literary salon.

===Turkey===
[[Fatma Aliye Topuz]] wrote for thirteen years between 1895 and 1908 columns in the magazine Hanımlara Mahsus Gazete ("Ladies' Own Gazette") and her sister [[Emine Semiye Onasya]] worked on the editorial staff.

==Music critics==

===Popular music===
[[File:Ann Powers 01A.jpg|thumb|right|200px|American pop music critic [[Ann Powers]] (pictured in 2007)]]
While there are significant numbers of [[Women in music|women vocalists]] singing in pop and rock music, many other aspects of pop and rock music are male-dominated, including [[record producer|record producing]], [[Instrumentalist|instrument playing]] and [[music journalism]]. According to Anwen Crawford, the "problem for women [popular music critics] is that our role in popular music was codified long ago", which means that "[b]ooks by living female rock critics (or jazz, hip-hop, and dance-music critics, for that matter) are scant."&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;Crawford, Anwen. "The World Needs Female Rock Critics" in ''The Atlantic''. 26 May 2015. Available at: http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-world-needs-female-rock-critics&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Simon Frith]] noted that pop and rock music "are closely associated with gender; that is, with conventions of male and female behaviour."&lt;ref name=Frith2001&gt;Frith, Simon, "Pop Music" in S. Frith, W. Stray and J. Street, ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock]]'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Holly Kruse, both popular music articles and academic articles about pop music are usually written from "masculine subject positions."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Steve, ed. (2002). Pop Music and the Press. Temple University Press. ASIN B00EKYXY0K. {{ISBN|9781566399661}}. p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; As well, there are relatively few women writing in music journalism: "By 1999, the number of female editors or senior writers at ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' hovered around...15%, [while] at ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' and ''[[Ray Gun (magazine)|Raygun]]'', [it was] roughly 20%."&lt;ref&gt;McLeod (2002) at 94, quoted in {{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Marion |chapter=Meaning Making in the Press |title=Gender in the Music Industry: Rock, Discourse, and Girl Power |location=Aldershot, Hampshire, England  |year= 2007 |page=67 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd  |isbn=9780754638629 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eMtDpy85IC4C&amp;pg=PA67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism associated with gender was discussed in a 2014 ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]'' article about the struggles of women in music journalism, written by music critic Tracy Moore, previously an editor at the ''[[Nashville Scene]]''.&lt;ref name=moore2014&gt;{{cite web|author=Moore, Tracy |date=20 March 2014 |title=Oh, the Unbelievable Shit You Get Writing About Music as a Woman |work=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] |url=http://jezebel.com/oh-the-unbelievable-shit-you-get-writing-about-music-a-1547444869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American music critic [[Ann Powers]], as a female critic and journalist, has written critiques on the perceptions of sex, racial and social minorities in the music industry. She has also written about feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwp.org/cs/public/print/resource/3696|title=Why I Write: Ann Powers Reflects on Writing About Rock|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/6485_guest-blog-ann-powers/|title=Pop music critic Ann Powers searches for the language of rock and roll|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 she accepted a position as chief pop-music critic at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', where she succeeded [[Robert Hilburn]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick MacDonald, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/artsentertainment/2002848360_aebriefs07.html Ann Powers named L.A. Times pop critic], ''Seattle Times'', 7 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Powers co-wrote the book ''[[Piece by Piece (book)|Piece by Piece]]'' with musician [[Tori Amos]], which discusses the role of women in the modern music industry, and features information about composing, touring, performance, and the realities of the music business.

Notable popular music critics include:
*[[Tanja Bakić]]
*[[Raquel Cepeda]]
*[[Ann Powers]]
*[[Joy Press]]
*[[Linda Solomon]]
*[[Lillian Roxon]]
*[[Penny Valentine]]

===Classical music===
[[File:Marion Lignana Rosenberg.png|thumb|right|180px|[[Marion Lignana Rosenberg]] (1961–2013) was a music critic, writer, translator, broadcaster and journalist. She wrote for many periodicals, including [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Playbill]]''.]]
In 2005, the National Arts Journalism Program (NAJP) at Columbia studied arts journalism in America and found that "the average classical music critic is a white, 52-year-old male with a [[graduate degree]], but twenty-six percent of all critics writing are female." However, William Osborne points out that this 26% figure includes all newspapers, including low-circulation regional papers. Osborne states that the "...large US papers, which are the ones that influence public opinion, have virtually no women classical music critics." The only female critics from major US papers are [[Anne Midgette]] (''New York Times'') and Wynne Delacoma (''Chicago Sun-Times''). Midgette was the "...first woman to cover classical music in the entire history of the paper."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osborne-conant.org/women-critics.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susannah Clapp]], a critic from ''The Guardian''–a newspaper that has a female classical music critic–stated in May 2014 that she had only then realized "...what a rarity" a female classical music critic is in journalism.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/may/25/sexism-stage-critics-tara-erraught-glyndebourne&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable women classical music critics include:
*[[Anne Midgette]] (''New York Times'')
*[[Marion Lignana Rosenberg]] (1961–2013)
