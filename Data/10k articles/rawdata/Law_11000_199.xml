Following the Syedna's death, Mufaddal took up the office of [[Da'i al-Mutlaq]], as per the appointment by Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/mumbai-mourns-syedna-mohammed-burhanuddins-demise-1346039.html|title=Mumbai mourns Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin's demise|work=First Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obotsYGvlIw|title=Live : Dr Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin's final journey|work=News Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khuzaima Qutbuddin|Khuzaima Qutubuddin]] claiming to have been appointed heir 50 years earlier in secrecy,&lt;ref name="Huff Post" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hindustantimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai/talk-of-rift-among-bohras-over-syedna-s-successor/article1-1044475.aspx|title=Talk of rift among Bohras over Syedna's successor|accessdate=26 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326095043/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai/talk-of-rift-among-bohras-over-syedna-s-successor/article1-1044475.aspx|archive-date=26 March 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenged Mufaddal's right to be Dai in court.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-claimant-to-syedna-seat-declares-official-challenge-1968682, 'but this has been challenged by Khuzaima'&lt;/ref&gt; He also took office as the 53rd Dā'ī of Dawoodi Bohras with two headquarters, the primary being in Darus Sakina in Thane and the other in Saifee Mahal where Mufaddal resides.&lt;ref name="press release"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fatemidawat.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/press-statement-april2014.pdf | title=Commencement of Legal Action by His Holiness Syedna Khuzaima Qutbuddin TUS, being the 53rd Dai al-Mutlaq and Head of the Dawoodi Bohra Community Against The False Claimant Shehzada Mufaddal Saifuddin: For Truth, Justice and Future of the Dawoodi Bohra Community | accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue is also historic in the sense that similar [[Dawoodi Bohra#Intra-Bohra schisms|case]] was put up in the court of Mughal emperor [[Akbar]], in year 1591AD,  where succession was challenged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/unique-case-from-akbar-s-court-in-1591-to-bombay-hc/story-u4QNPgu4wyYETNUSa2mjVN.html]; Unique case: From Akbar’s court in 1591 to Bombay HC &lt;/ref&gt; There is also a unique case ([[Chandabhoy Galla Case]]) filed in the British time court in Mumbai, in 1917 and decided in 1921, where claim was based on modality of succession earlier done. In the both of these case challenger were defeated, Syedna [[Dawood Bin Qutubshah]] remained  Dai in 1591AD&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010210004257/http://www.bohra.net/archive/ahmedabad.html]; History of Duat Mutlakin's of Ahmedabad&lt;/ref&gt; and, ownership of the Chandabhoy Galla remained with Syedna [[Taher Saifuddin]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=0857735268]; History   A Modern History of the Ismailis: Continuity and Change in a Muslim Community; edited by Farhad Daftary  2010 - Social Science; 'legal battle with dissidents:-chandbhai case,

== Overview ==

=== Mufaddal Saifuddin's Position ===
[[Mufaddal Saifuddin]] states that he has been appointed a number of times in presence of multiple witnesses.&lt;ref name="His Holiness 615"&gt;{{cite book |last= His Holiness |first= Syedna Aali Qadr Mufaddal Saifuddin Saheb |date= 1436H |title=  رسالة اننعي المسماة - حكمة الغيبة القدسانية الابدية |url= |location= |publisher= His Holiness Syedna Aali Qadr Mufaddal Saifuddin Saheb, Badri Mahal, Mumbai, India |page= 615 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These incidences are:

* In October/November 2005, during the month of Ramadan 1426H, in the presence of Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]]'s eldest son [[Qaidjoher Ezzuddin]] and Malek al Ashtar Shujauddin.&lt;ref name="His Holiness 615" /&gt;
* On 4 June 2011 (corresponding to 3 Rajab al-Asab 1432H) in [[Cromwell Hospital]], London, in the presence of 6 witnesses.&lt;ref name="His Holiness 615" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Syedna-suffers-stroke-names-son-successor/articleshow/8754141.cms|title=Syedna suffers stroke, names son successor |date= 7 June 2011 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For three years from 2011 to 2014 Mufaddal Saifuddin assumed the role of Syedna's successor. In the [[Dawoodi Bohra]] [[Mithaq]] (oath of allegiance), [[Mufaddal Saifuddin]]'s name was taken alongside Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]]'s as the successor.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Together,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":322"/&gt; [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]] and [[Mufaddal Saifuddin]] traveled the globe&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; looking after the affairs&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; of the community&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt; up until Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]]'s death in 2014. Henceforth, he assumed the role of the 53rd [[Da'i al-Mutlaq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.samaa.tv/pakistan/2014/01/syedi-mufaddal-bhaisaheb-saifuddin-becomes-spiritual-leader-of-bohra-community/|title=Syedi Mufaddal Bhaisaheb Saifuddin becomes spiritual leader of Bohra community {{!}} SAMAA TV|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Khuzaima Qutbuddin's Claim ===
In 2011 up to 2014, Khuzaima Qutbuddin&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; and his family&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; had publicly declared and congratulated Mufaddal Saifuddin as the successor. On a few occasions, Khuzaima Qutbuddin was seen participating in public gatherings seated below&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; Mufaddal Saifuddin. Until the Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]]'s death, there wasn't any indication of objection from [[Khuzaima Qutbuddin]].

Following the Syedna's death in January 2014, [[Khuzaima Qutbuddin]], who was the second in command to [[Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin]], claimed the title of the 53rd Dā'ī l-Muṭlaq of the Dawoodi Bohras. Khuzaima Qutbuddin claims that Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin performed [[Nass (Islam)|nass]] on him 49 years ago in 1965 a ritual during which he appointed him as his successor in private without any witnesses.&lt;ref name="trouble"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/who-is-new-syedna-trouble-brews-as-half-brother-stakes-claim/|title=Who is new Syedna? Trouble brews as half-brother stakes claim|date=6 February 2014|work=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qutbuddin states that Syedna Burhanuddin told him that this was because otherwise, 'swords would be crossed'.

The rift between the two claimants started to appear even before the death of Burhanuddin, with followers of Khuzaima Qutbuddin rallying support for Khuzaima.&lt;ref name="rift" /&gt; A group formed in 2013 in support of Burhanuddin's half-brother [[Khuzaima Qutbuddin]], who was Mazoon, serving second under Dai al Mutlaq.&lt;ref name="rift" /&gt; Khuzaima has denied formation of any separate sect by publishing a public affidavit.{{citation needed|date=July 2016|reason= Is there any source for this affidavit?}}

[[Khuzaima Qutbuddin]] died on 30 March 2016. On 31 March 2016 the family of [[Khuzaima Qutbuddin]] released a statement that Khuzaima Qutbuddin had conferred nass (announcement of successor) on his son [[Taher Fakhruddin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianage.com/mumbai/syedna-s-death-won-t-affect-succession-row-high-court-717|title=Syedna's death won't affect succession row in High Court|work=[[The Asian Age]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronological Account of the events in 2011 ==

=== The Events of 4 June 2011 ===
On 4 June 2011 (corresponding to 3 Rajab al-Asab 1432H), His Holiness Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]] gathered three of his sons (commonly referred to as Shehzadas), namely Qusai, Idris and Ammar; his daughter Husaina; son in law Dr Moiz, and grandson Abdul Qadir to his room at [[Cromwell Hospital]]. He made a declaration appointing his son [[Mufaddal Saifuddin]] as his successor, and instructed them to inform the [[Dawoodi Bohra]] community.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1= |title= مثال - نص داعي الطيب منصور اليمن على المولى عقيق اليمن - 19 شهر رمضان 1432هـ |url= |accessdate= |publisher=Alvazaratus Saifiyah |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]] then summoned [[Mufaddal Saifuddin]] and his eldest son [[Qaidjoher Ezzuddin]] to [[Cromwell Hospital]], where a short [[Majlis]] was held in [[Cromwell Hospital]], Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]] was congratulated on his appointment, drank [[sharbat|sherbet]] and everyone present performed [[Š-L-M|salaam]] to Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]] and [[Mufaddal Saifuddin]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Khuzaima Qutbuddin]] challenged this ascension and claimed that Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]] was too ill to have spoken coherently, and medically unfit to move or drink [[sharbat|sherbet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/others/Late-Syedna-too-ill-to-have-spoken-coherently/articleshow/33144765.cms|title= LATE SYEDNA 'TOO ILL TO HAVE SPOKEN COHERENTLY' |date= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reply to these allegations, an audio recording of the appointment, and a video recording of the [[Majlis]] in [[Cromwell Hospital]] was shown to the entire [[Dawoodi Bohra]] community on 18 May 2014 (corresponding to 19 Rajab al Asab 1435H). This video confirmed Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]] speaking coherently to his family, drinking [[sharbat|sherbet]] and presiding over the [[Majlis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawoodi-bohras.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=10277&amp;sid=cfd77d27f5f6babe9fe98fe6b131075a|title= Audio/Video clips on Nass |date= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore affirming the events described by [[Qaidjoher Ezzuddin]] and the Alvazaratus Saifiyah document.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Qutbuddin has not responded to this video.

==== Syedna's Medical Condition ====
At the time of Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]]'s stroke his sons, attendant physician and son-in-law, Dr Moiz bhaisaheb and surviving daughter were present in London with him along with other close family members. Neither Qutbuddin nor his family were present before or subsequently.

The medical report presented by Khuzaima Qutbuddin explicitly ruled out the possibility of the Syedna having any ability to coherently speak or move.&lt;ref name="perilous"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/cover-story/A-perilous-transition/articleshow/29266169.cms|title=A perilous transition|date=2014-01-24|publisher=Mumbai Mirror|accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mumbaimirrorill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/others/Late-Syedna-too-ill-to-have-spoken-coherently/articleshow/33144765.cms |title=Late Syedna 'too ill to have spoken coherently' |work=Mumbai Mirror |date=2014-04-03 |accessdate=2014-04-04 |publisher=[[The Times Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DNA Nass Article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_successor-to-syedna-mohammed-burhanuddin-named_1551640|title=Successor to Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin named|work=dna}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The review&lt;ref name="mumbaimirrorill" /&gt; was done by Dr Daniel Mankens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doctors.beaumont.org/provider/Daniel+H+Arndt/227272 |title= Dr Daniel Menkes |date= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; chairman of Neurology Beaumont Hospital, Michigan. He writes, 'It is inconceivable that someone his age and with neurological deficits would have such a profound, yet transient recovery.' He goes on to say that 'family members usually report even the slightest improvement to medical staff. It surprises me that such an event would not be documented in the medical record, much less reported to the medical staff'. Based on this review report, Qutbuddin claimed that 'the succession was not done in London Hospital' as Mohammad Burhanuddin suffered from a 'full stroke at the age of 100 that made it difficult for him to write, speak, or move'.&lt;ref name="mumbaimirrorill" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mumbaimirror1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/others/Dawoodi-Bohra-succession-battle-takes-legal-turn/articleshow/33092989.cms |title=Dawoodi Bohra succession battle takes legal turn |work=Mumbai Mirror |date=2014-04-02 |accessdate=2014-04-04 | publisher=[[The Times Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctors behind these reports had never met nor treated Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]] at any time and gave their opinions based on medical reports and the explanations provided by [[Khuzaima Qutbuddin]].

Meanwhile, the specialists who treated, attended to Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]] and who actually wrote the medical reports do not agree with these opinions. Dr John Francis Costello;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bupacromwellhospital.com/find-a-doctor/find-a-consultant/john-costello/ |title= Dr John Costello |date= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consultant in Respiratory Medicine, and Neurologist Dr Omar Malik,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bupacromwellhospital.com/find-a-doctor/find-a-consultant/omar-malik/ |title= Dr Omar Malik |date= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; both who had attended to Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]] at [[Cromwell Hospital]] in London have stated, in writing, that His Holiness was capable of making the declaration and of conducting a ceremony, even though his speech was slurred.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malik |first1= Dr Omar|title= Letter – Neurological assessment and management of His Holiness between 01 June 2011 and over the subsequent 96 hours |url= |accessdate= |publisher= Dr Omar Malik, PHD, FRCP – Consultant Neurologist (GMC No:3276389) |date=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Dr Costello stated that he believes the report provided by the USA doctor Dr Daniel Menkes is incorrect.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Francis Costello |first1= John|title= Letter – Summary of my view on the state of His Holiness's health in June 2011 |url= |accessdate= |publisher=Notarized by Sarah Karen Mackie England Notary Public |date=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He confirmed that his patient, Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]] indeed did communicate his wishes on a variety of issues during his admission.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

On 4 June, the day of the [[Nass (Islam)|Nass]] in question, Dr Costello noted that there was evidence of continued improvement in Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]]'s health&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; He confirmed that although he did not witness the said [[Nass (Islam)|Nass]], there was no doubt that Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]] was able to effectively communicate his wishes whilst at [[Cromwell Hospital]], particularly in his mother toungue [[Lisan al-Dawat]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In regards to His Holiness's intellective state, both Dr Costello and Dr Malik confirmed that he was of sound cognitive state, and that he was able to clearly communicate with his family and medical staff.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; In regards to the reports by the USA doctors, Dr Omar denied there was any evidence of a receptive speech problem.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Dr Costello further expresses he felt a special connection with His Holiness as he often greet him with a smile of recognition, looked him in the eye, interacted in English, and even become lively at times.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

A year later in 2012, Dr Costello was invited on stage to meet Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin. In his medical report&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; he notes that Syedna instantly smiled at him with recognition, and shook his hand for a lengthy time.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zeninfosys.net/zen/sites/default/files/styles/akhbar-popup/public/photos/akhbar/huzurala-tus/2012-07/15080/13-07-2012-217907-img88380.jpg?itok=qqyJnfO6|title=SMB meeting with Dr Costello|last=|first=|date=14 July 2012|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zeninfosys.net/zen/sites/default/files/styles/akhbar-popup/public/photos/akhbar/huzurala-tus/2012-07/15080/13-07-2012-217908-img88400.jpg?itok=8EW70ED6|title=SMB shaking hands with Dri Costello|last=|first=|date=14 July 2012|website=|publisher=Zeninfosys|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These reports were submitted in court in the sworn affidavit submitted by Shehzada [[Qaidjoher Ezzuddin]] the eldest son of Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]] before the [[Mumbai High Court|Bombay High Court]].

=== The Raudat Tahera Ceremony ===
On 8 June 2011, Dr John Francis Costello noted improvements in His Holiness's health and there were discussions about his wishes to travel to [[Mumbai]] for to attend the death anniversary of his father Syedna [[Taher Saifuddin]]&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; which was to be held on 20 June 2011. By 15 June 2011, there was further improvement. Dr John Francis Costello approved of sending His Holiness to [[Mumbai]] in an air ambulance as it was deemed safe and appropriate.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; On this day, Dr Costello recalls having a short coherent conversation in English with His Holiness about his journey to [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; On 17 June 2011, His Holiness was discharged from [[Cromwell Hospital]] and traveled to Mumbai, as planned, in an air ambulance.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; These sequence of events, His Holiness's wishes to travel and the doctor's approval are of paramount significance because the group loyal to Qutbuddin allege that His Holiness was forced to travel against his own will despite suffering a stroke. Dr Costello's letter proves otherwise.

A ceremony was arranged in [[Raudat Tahera]] [[Mumbai]] on 20 June 2011 (corresponding to 19th Rajab 1432H) to declare [[Mufaddal Saifuddin]] as the Dā'ī.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge9wG2Irv-Q|title=Nass – Raudat Tahera – 19th Rajab 1432 (Part 1)|date=|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire ceremony was recorded and was broadcast on the same day to Dawoodi Bohra community centers worldwide. This video was posted by Qutbuddin's website and re-posted by another [[Youtube]] user.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Images of this ceremony are also available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://qutbibohras.blogspot.com/2014/12/guidance-through-history.html|title=Qutbi Bohras: Guidance through history|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bombay High Court case ===
The late Syedna's half-brother Qutbuddin went to the High Court claiming the position of 53rd and to restrict Saifuddin from discharging the duties as the 53rd Dā'ī. The prime contention of the 700-page petition to the High Court was to have Qutbuddin, the half-brother, legally declared as the 53rd Dā'ī al-Mutlaq of the 1.2-million-strong Bohra community, while simultaneously preventing his nephew, Mufaddal Saifuddin, from acting as the Dā'ī.&lt;ref name="mumbaimirror1" /&gt;

Justice SJ Kathawala of the Bombay High Court [[judicial disqualification|recused]] himself from hearing the suit filed by Qutbuddin as he had appeared for the late Syedna in the past, creating a conflict of interest. The Lawyers appearing for Saifuddin had no objection to Justice SJ Kathawala from hearing the suit, however Qutbuddin's lawyer Mr Kadam requested the judge to recuse himself from the case.&lt;ref name=":36"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Religious-matters-must-not-come-to-court-HC-judge/articleshow/33411113.cms|title=Religious matters must not come to court: HC judge - Times of India|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This delayed the suit before being placed before Justice Gautam Patel at the High Court.&lt;ref name=":36" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-bombay-high-court-judge-recuses-himself-from-hearing-syedna-successor-row-1976144|title=Bombay high court judge recuses himself from hearing Syedna successor row|date=2014-04-08|website=DNA|publisher=Diligent Media Corporation|author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s) --&gt;|accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qutbuddin sought relief including entry to Saify Mahal, the house of the community leader,filed a 700-page suit asking the court to restrain Mufaddal Saifuddin to act as the [[Da'i al-Mutlaq]]. In reply to the suit, defendant Mufaddal Saifuddin filed a detailed 494-page affidavit on 23 April 2014.&lt;ref name=":111"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/High-Court-willing-to-hold-daily-trial-in-Syedna-lawsuit/articleshow/36676279.cms|title=High Court willing to hold daily trial in Syedna lawsuit - Times of India|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Gautam Patel said it would be better to hold the trial rather than decide on interim relief.&lt;ref name=":111"/&gt; The Bombay High Court later agreed that it is willing to conduct a speedy, day-to-day trial&lt;ref name=":111"/&gt;

==== Framing of Issues ====
In September 2014, the court had framed issues in the matter, where each side will have to prove he was conferred valid nass, or the official declaration of succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai/bohra-succession-row-hc-to-judge-if-qutbuddin-can-prove-anointment/story-OQA3x20XwOxDrcfwxw3LbL.html|title=Bohra succession row: HC to judge if Qutbuddin can prove anointment|date=2014-09-15|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was then fixed for 11 December 2014, to determine the admissibility of the documents placed on record by both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pressreader.com/india/hindustan-times-st-mumbai/20141111/281951721106680|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issues framed on 15 September 2014 in Suit No. 336 of 2014 were:
* What are the requirements of a valid Nass as per the tenets of the faith?&lt;ref name=":37"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fatemidawatlegal.com/all/bombay-high-court-declaratory-suit-update-15th-september-2014/|title=Bombay High Court Declaratory Suit Update: 15th September 2014 {{!}} Fatemi Dawat Legal|website=fatemidawatlegal.com|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whether the Plaintiff proves that a valid Nass was conferred/pronounced on him as stated in the Plaint?
* Whether a Nass once conferred cannot be retracted or revoked or changed or superseded?
* Whether the Defendant proves that a valid Nass was conferred on him by the 52nd Dai: On 28 January 1969, in the year 2005, on 4 June 2011, On 20 June 2011  as stated in the written statement and if the answer is in the negative then whether any Nass proved on the Defendant as above consequently amounts to a retraction or revocation or change or supersession of any Nass previously conferred on the Plaintiff by the 52nd Dai?&lt;ref name=":37" /&gt;
The case began with the new judge asking Qutbuddin, what requirements had to be fulfilled for "pronouncing a Syedna's successor", such as witnesses, publicity and acceptance by the community.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; He also asked Qutbuddin to spell out what he did to establish his right as the spiritual head since 2011 when his nephew was publicly pronounced the successor by the late Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Spell-out-steps-you-took-to-be-spiritual-head-since-2011-Bombay-HC-tells-Syednas-uncle/articleshow/34390197.cms|title=Spell out steps you took to be spiritual head since 2011, Bombay HC tells Syedna’s uncle - Times of India|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed a reply from Saifuddin's attorney and the late Syedna's eldest son [[Qaidjoher Ezzuddin]], which contested Qutbuddin's claim.&lt;ref name="Sequeira"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Spell-out-steps-you-took-to-be-spiritual-head-since-2011-Bombay-HC-tells-Syednas-uncle/articleshow/34390197.cms|title=Spell out steps you took to be spiritual head since 2011, Bombay HC tells Syedna's uncle|last=Sequeira|first=Rosy|date=29 April 2014|publisher=[[The Times Group]]|location=Mumbai|work=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="howchosen"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/how-is-syedna-chosen-hc-wants-to-know/|title=How is Syedna chosen? HC wants to know|date=30 April 2014|newspaper=The Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On behalf of Mufaddal Saifuddni, Ezzuddin stated that there was "overwhelming evidence" that Saifuddin was chosen by the late Dai to be his successor and between 2011 when he was appointed the successor and in January 2014 when the 52nd Dai passed away - Saifuddin "operated within the community as the successor designate". Also, after his father's demise, Saifuddin was given misaq (oath of allegiance) by 500 Jamaats all over the world and high dignitaries.&lt;ref name=":06"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Spell-out-steps-you-took-to-be-spiritual-head-since-2011-Bombay-HC-tells-Syednas-uncle/articleshow/34390197.cms|title=Spell out steps you took to be spiritual head since 2011, Bombay HC tells Syedna’s uncle - Times of India|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"As per court proceedings, Qutbuddin's lawyer pointed out that Saifuddin's earlier pleading of succession was  only referring the pronouncement done in year 2011 at London hospital, but after demise of late Syedna, now the case is put up in different way and now it refers that pronouncements were 'made in 1969, 1994 and 2005 and only reconfirmation was done in 2011'."&lt;ref name="Sequeira" /&gt;

Qutbuddin alleged that "[s]ince 1980, defendant (Saifuddin) and his family implemented a devious scheme to malign him"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/qutbuddin-tells-hc-that-syedna-had-appointed-him-as-successor/16172176|title=Qutbuddin tells HC that Syedna had appointed him as successor|date=29 April 2015|work=[[Mid Day]]|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Patel declined Kadam's plea to pass an order for access to Qutbuddin to his office in Saify Mahal and his apartment at Al Azhar.

Saifuddin's counsel Iqbal Chagla questioned Qutbuddin on the meaning of various terminologies used in the community and degrees for knowledge of scriptures awarded by [[Al Jamea tus Saifiyah]]  and conferred by the Dai. Qutbuddin admitted to being conferred the degree of ''Al Aleem Al Bare'' (The Outstanding Scholar) by his father, Syedna [[Taher Saifuddin]] but denied he was conferred any degree by his late brother Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Siblings-silently-back-me-for-title-Syednas-kin/articleshow/47077519.cms|title=Siblings silently back me for title: Syedna’s kin - Times of India|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was to bring forth his knowledge of Islamic studies and degrees being conferred by the principal of the Dawoodi Bohra community's educational institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-none-of-my-siblings-openly-support-my-claim-to-being-the-53rd-syedna-khuzaima-qutbuddin-2081251|title=None of my siblings openly support my claim to being the 53rd Syedna: Khuzaima Qutbuddin {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=2015-04-28|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qutbuddin also told the court that the highest title is the ''Umdat al Ulama al Muwahhadeen'' (support of unparalleled scholar), which was given to Burhanuddin by the 51st dai.&lt;ref name=":211" /&gt;

Qutbuddin claimed that he did not challenge Saifuddin's claims at the time because he (Qutbuddin) had been asked to maintain his appointment in confidence by Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin. He prayed and hoped that "Syedna Burhanuddin Saheb would recover and set the position right in the manner he deemed appropriate".&lt;ref name=":211"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-none-of-my-siblings-openly-support-my-claim-to-being-the-53rd-syedna-khuzaima-qutbuddin-2081251|title=None of my siblings openly support my claim to being the 53rd Syedna: Khuzaima Qutbuddin {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=2015-04-28|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2) 28 April 2015:''' Qutbuddin admitted to being informed that a ''majlis'' was to be held on 6 June 2011 at Saifee Masjid and the reason for it. When asked what the reason for the ''majlis'' was, Qutbuddin replied,"The majlis was because His Holiness' health was not good and an announcement was to be made of the alleged nass conferred on the defendant (Saifuddin)." &lt;ref name=":38"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Prayed-for-long-life-of-Syedna-Half-brother-tells-HC/articleshow/48273001.cms|title=Prayed for long life of Syedna : Half-brother tells HC - Times of India|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He admitted to drinking the celebratory sherbat offered. "That was routine,&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; said Qutbuddin. When asked if the majlis had been convened for condolence, would sherbat have been offered, he replied,"No.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; He added that the ''majlis'' was not a condolence meeting. "I did, in fact, pray for the long life of the Syedna,&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; he said.&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt;

Qutbuddin also said that two attempts were made to kill him; first in Indore during Muharram and the second in Yemen,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/Kin-Clash-Over-Control-on-Rich-Dawoodi-Bohra-Community/2015/08/23/article2988141.ece|title=Kin Clash Over Control on Rich Dawoodi Bohra Community|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, he named no suspects, nor dates, in court.&lt;ref name="courtapril27"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/special/court-battle-lays-bare-inner-intrigues-of-bohras-priestly-family/20150428.htm|title=Court battle lays bare inner intrigues of Bohras' priestly family|date=30 April 2015|work=[[Rediff.com]]|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''3) 29 July 2015:''' Qutbuddin said that he was referred to as ''al Walad al Ahabb,'' meaning the 'beloved son'. According to him, this carried the meaning that he was the successor. Counsel Iqbal Chagla, however, suggested to him that one Hussain Dawoodbhai of Sri Lanka was also referred to as ''al Walad al Ahabb''. Qutbuddin alleged that the meaning may be the same but the context was different.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dnasyndication.com/showarticlerss.aspx?nid=ZZXvspMsMOCU1SgaITYLM8ZGplAN5KAi0wkQGEuEWEE=|title='Attended majlis where successor was announced' - Mumbai - News {{!}} News Syndication {{!}} Content Syndication|website=dnasyndication.com|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qutbuddin also confirmed that shortly after Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin's sroke in 2011, he had called [[Qaidjoher Ezzuddin]] in London to wish the Syedna and his successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai/talk-of-rift-among-bohras-over-syedna-s-successor/story-cb4UkDJk2lUM1JD3RkHUkJ.html|title=Talk of rift among Bohras over Syedna’s successor|date=2013-04-15|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''4) - 31 July 2015:''' Qutbuddin told Court he was very hurt at being prevented from visiting [[Raudat Tahera]]. Chagla asked him if there has been a single instance when he was prevented. Qutbuddin replied that he had sent his sons to visit the mausoleum a few months ago. "They were actually beaten and pushed away.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; he said. But Chagla asked, "Have you personally been prevented from visiting the [[Raudat Tahera]]?&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. He replied "I did not go because my security advised me not to do so.". When Chagla asked if the statement that he was prevented from visiting is incorrect, Qutbuddin said, "I don&lt;nowiki&gt;'t agree. I stand by my statement.''&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Im-hurt-at-being-barred-from-mausoleum-Syednas-uncle/articleshow/48302656.cms|title=I’m hurt at being barred from mausoleum: Syedna’s uncle - Times of India|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counsel Iqbal Chagla, showed several documents to Qutbuddin and sought his reply on whether those were written by the 52nd Dai and whether he recognized it. To some he accepted and to some he replied in the negative or sought to study them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-challenger-to-syedna-post-claims-he-can-t-enter-raudat-tahera-2109976|title=Challenger to Syedna post claims he can't enter Raudat Tahera {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=2015-08-01|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''5) - 3 Aug 2015:''' Qutbuddin claimed that even his father, Syedna [[Taher Saifuddin]], had viewed him as a successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://epaperbeta.timesofindia.com/Article.aspx?eid=31804&amp;articlexml=Even-my-father-viewed-me-as-a-successor-04082015005015|title=The Times Group|website=epaperbeta.timesofindia.com|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an earlier hearing, he alleged that Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]] had appointed him as the ''Mazoon'' and gave a sermon, at that time he said 'I was a beloved son', and this carried the meaning that he was his successor. He again reiterated the same thing by saying that it is correct that his appointment as Mazoon was done in a public sermon by the 52nd Dai.&lt;ref name=":44"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afternoondc.in/city-news/syedna-burhanuddin-said-i-am-beloved-son-says-qutbuddin-during-cross-examination/article_145524|title=Syedna Burhanuddin said I am beloved son, says Qutbuddin during cross-examination|website=afternoondc.in|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''6) - 4 Aug 2015:''' Qutbuddin was asked about the exact phrase used by Syedna [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]] in his sermon on 10 Dec 1965 and when according to him, he said that you are his beloved son? Qutbuddin replied, "Al-waladul-ahabb."&lt;ref name=":44"/&gt; Chagla asked him whether the translation of Al-walad ul-ahabb meant ''the'' beloved son or ''my'' beloved son. Qutbuddin maintained it meant  ''my'' beloved son. He was then shown paragraph 28 (a) at page 64 of his plaint where it stated "my [lit. 'the'] beloved son". Qutbuddin was questioned as to what the meaning of [lit. 'the'] was and whether he agreed that the meaning of the phrase was in fact ''the'' beloved son. Qutbuddin said that he was confused as to why he said "my" when the translation provided by his son in the plaint stated the words "[lit. 'the']". When asked whether the translation done in the plaint was incorrect, he said he was confused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al Jamea tus Saifiyah, London|first=|date=10 April 2016|title=Fateh Mubeen Exhibition|url=|journal=معرض الفتح المبين|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around more than 400 questions were asked in which the examination centered around the sermon of 52nd Dai which mentioned the word "beloved son".&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

'''7) 24 Aug 2015:''' Chagla asked Qutbuddin whether Mufaddal Saifuddin and his brothers were his pupils in matters of "spiritual guidance ". He replied, "Not regularly. But only once in a while". When asked how often, he replied, "They were regular during one period of time but not later." He said Burhanuddin sent his sons to him and this was for about ten years during his reign. While he could not remember the exact period they were his pupils, Qutbuddin added that they came to him from the time of his father, the 51st Dai.

Qutbuddin later stated that "if not all then many" persons of higher spiritual value knew he was made the ''mansoos'' (successor) and even offered him ''sajda'' (prostration). He alleged that Saifuddin and his brothers used to offer him ''sajda''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Nephew-was-my-student-Syednas-uncle-tells-HC/articleshow/48657792.cms|title=Nephew was my student, Syedna’s uncle tells HC - Times of India|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked whether ''sajda'' (physical prostration) could be offered to a person other than a dai, Qutbuddin said, "Sajda is offered only to a dai or the mansoos or to a person known as one who will succeed the dai." "I remember my sisters would sometimes do so (offer him sajda). I do not remember if my brothers did it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-incumbent-syedna-his-brothers-were-my-pupils-for-spiritual-learning-khuzaima-qutbuddin-2118053|title=Incumbent Syedna, his brothers were my pupils for spiritual learning: Khuzaima Qutbuddin {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=2015-08-25|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''8) 25 Aug 2015:''' Qutbuddin stated that '''i'''n the last years of his life, late Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin was not as mentally alert as he used to be. When advocate Iqbal Chagla asked whether Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin was in full control of his mental and physical faculties till the end, Qutbuddin answered, "I felt and believed that his health had deteriorated during the last two and a half years of his life." He said Syedna Burhanuddin was "unable to function and carry out his activities as before."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Late-Syedna-was-less-alert-in-sunset-years/articleshow/48672477.cms|title=‘Late Syedna was less alert in sunset years’ - Times of India|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Status of case following the death of Khuzaima Qutbuddin (Plaintiff) ====
The hearings were later fixed from 22 April to 2 May 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Bombay-high-court-fixes-fresh-trial-dates-in-Syedna-succession-row/articleshow/51286997.cms|title=Bombay high court fixes fresh trial dates in Syedna succession row - Times of India|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, after [[Khuzaima Qutbuddin]]'s death on 30 March 2016, the Bombay High Court cancelled these two dates.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-bombay-high-court-cancels-cross-examination-of-khuzaima-qutbuddin-due-to-his-death-2199109|title=Bombay High Court cancels cross examination of Khuzaima Qutbuddin due to his death {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=2016-04-07|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Indian law, upon the death of a plaintiff a suit will not abate immediately upon death but rather after 90 days if no action is taken by the legal heirs or representatives of the plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalservicesindia.com/article/article/no-abetment-by-parties-death-if-right-to-sue-survive-498-1.html|title=No abetment by parties death if right to sue survive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Fakhruddin intends to continue the case, it is likely that such an application would be made and the case would not abate.&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt; Accordingly, Justice Patel also said if Fakhruddin decides that he would like to be substituted as plaintiff he will have to file a chamber summons to set aside the abatement of the suit, and that "Nobody requires an order that that the suit has abated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/With-death-of-Syednas-uncle-his-succession-suit-abates-HC/articleshow/51717768.cms|title=With death of Syedna's uncle, his succession suit abates: HC|date=6 April 2016|author=Rosy Sequeira|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 4 July 2016, [[Taher Fakhruddin]] reported that he has written a letter to [[Mufaddal Saifuddin]] in which he mentions that he has filed a Chamber Summons in the Bombay High Court as the plaintiff in place of his late father [[Khuzaima Qutbuddin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newkerala.com/news/2016/fullnews-85865.html|title=Leadership tangle continues to dog Dawoodi Bohra community|date=4 July 2016|author=|work=New Kerala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A senior counsel commented that the [[Da'i al-Mutlaq]] is not a hereditary title that can be passed on from a father to a son; it’s an appointment that is made. This is the basis on which Khuzaima Qutbuddin had challenged the naming of Mufaddal Saifuddin as the 53rd Syedna. Taher Fakhruddin will have to prove that his father had been appointed as the Syedna, and only then can he claim the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/following-khuzaima-qutbuddins-death-battle-for-supremacy-in-bohra-community-takes-a-new-turn/17096171|title=Following Khuzaima Qutbuddin's death, battle for supremacy in Bohra community takes a new turn|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 March 2017, Justice Gautam Patel allowed Taher Fakhruddin's plea to be substituted as plaintiff in this suit, stating that although [[Taher Fakhruddin]] was free to file a separate suit, including him in the current suit would save judicial time, money and valuable amounts of paper. The matter was set for direction on 25 April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bombay-hc-relief-for-rival-claimant-to-syedna-title/articleshow/57522940.cms|title=Bombay HC relief for rival claimant to Syedna title - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-fakhruddin-can-challenge-53rd-syedna-for-post-bombay-high-court-2345858|title=Fakhruddin can challenge 53rd Syedna for post: Bombay High Court {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=2017-03-08|work=dna|access-date=2017-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court then fixed the dates of 8, 11 and 12 December 2017 for the cross examination of Taher Fakhruddin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fatemidawatlegal.com/all/bombay-high-court-october-30th-2017/|title=Bombay High Court October 30th 2017 {{!}} Fatemi Dawat Legal|website=fatemidawatlegal.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cross Examintation of Taher Fakhruddin (Petitioner) ====
The cross examination of Taher Fakhruddin commenced on  8 December 2017.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/dawoodi-bohra-succession-case-live-updates-bombay-high-court-to-hear-case-on-8-11-and-12-december-4248371.html|title=Dawoodi Bohra Succession Case LIVE updates: Fakhruddin claims he received special knowledge meant for Dai from his father LIVE News, Latest Updates, Live blog, Highlights and Live coverage - Firstpost|date=2017-12-08|work=Firstpost|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''8 December 2017:''' Anand Desai appeared for Taher Fakhruddin.  The petitioner submits letters as evidence. Examination-in-chief of Fakhruddin, Anand Desai cross examined Fakhruddin aasking him the function of the ''mazoon mutlaq'' and ''mukasir'', to which he replied that "''Mazoon'' administers the oath to the believers, shows them the position of the Dai" and the "''mukasir'' does what the Dai wants them to do and that they don't have absolute authority". On the subject of ''nass'', Fakhruddin said there was no one prescribed method, but there must be a clear communication of ''nass'' in the form of a direct statement by the preceding dai to the one he confers the nass, or there must be an indication from the Dai. He further claimed that no witnesses were needed during ''nass,'' and there were historical precedents for a private ''nass''. He stated that a ''nass'' is irrevocable and final, "It can't be changed or superseded".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-battle-for-bohri-syedna-post-goes-to-bombay-high-court-2566160|title=Battle for Bohri Syedna post goes to Bombay High Court {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=2017-12-09|work=dna|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also asked as to what happens when a successor passes away before the dai. He added that 6th Dai told 7th dai who to appoint as 8th Dai; and the 28th Dai appointed the 29th Dai in accordance with the wishes of the 27th Dai.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/i-have-special-knowledge-to-lead-bohras-syedna-to-bombay-high-court/1184117|title=I have special knowledge to lead Bohras: Syedna to Bombay High Court {{!}} Free Press Journal|website=www.freepressjournal.in|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''22 March 2018:''' Justice Gautam Patel commented on what appeared to be contradictions between Taher Fakhruddin's written submissions and his court testimony in regard to Taher Fakhruddin's statementsthat Queen [[Arwa al-Sulayhi]] was 'to be the single witness to the nass he conferred via the Sijil-ul-Bisharat.' This contradiction was pointed out three times, following which Justice Patel expressed his impatience with the slow pace of this case into its fourth year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mid-day.com/articles/mumbai-high-court-judge-expresses-his-impatience-with-the-slow-pace-of-syedna-row/19228197|title=Mumbai: High Court judge expresses his impatience with the slow pace of Syedna row|date=2018-03-22|work=mid-day|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gujarat High Court case ===
[[Gujarat High Court]] issued an interim order on 16 April 2014 prohibiting Saifuddin from acting as the 53rd Dā'ī and his supporters from dealing with the trust properties. Khuzaima filed eight [[writ]] petitions before [[Gujarat High Court]] pertaining to the succession controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/City/Mumbai/Syedna-row-8-petitions-in-Gujarat-HC/articleshow/33834539.cms|title=Syedna row: 8 petitions in Gujarat HC|date=17 April 2014|publisher=The Times Group|author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s) --&gt;|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/gujarat-hc-grants-injunction-on-dawoodi-bohra-trusts-wakfs-114041601405_1.html|title=Gujarat HC grants injunction on Dawoodi Bohra trusts, Wakfs|date=16 April 2014|author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s) --&gt;|work=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; This order was rescinded to allow [[Mufaddal Saifuddin]] full control over and use of all properties in Gujarat, provided that as the sole trustee, nothing is done to degenerate the value of the trust, effectively allowing him to operate as the 53rd Dai, but without granting such recognition. This situation was to remain pending the outcome of the Bombay High Court.

=== UK Charity Commission ===
In May 2014, Khuzaima Qutbuddin approached the UK Charity Commission&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt; claiming that there was no valid appointee as the [[Da'i al-Mutlaq]]. On 15 August 2014, the UK Charity Commission&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/charity-commission|title=The Charity Commission - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; altered their position in favour of Mufaddal Saifuddin. The Commission established that there is someone in office, albeit that their position is being challenged. They also stated in writing, that "our view is therefore that His Holiness Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin is the current incumbent of the office of Dai al-Mutlaq."&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; They further stated that Mufaddal Saifuddin can continue to administer the Charity until the outcome of the Bombay High Court case is known.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

The [[Progressive Dawoodi Bohra]] took a neutral stance in wake of the succession controversy, citing dubious claims of both the would-be successors and the wealth accumulated by the late Syedna's family. The Progressives' Central Board warned the claimants that they would be "consigned to the [[Ash heap of history|dustbins of history]]" if they do not adapt and act more fairly.&lt;ref name="Press Conference" /&gt; Several community members interviewed welcomed the court action as they looked forward to corruption in the community being exposed.&lt;ref name="scroll"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/660414|title=As Bohra succession battle heads to court, support for challenger gathers steam|last=Johari|first=Aarefa|date=2 April 2014|website=Scroll.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Software''' is [[software]] used in the [[finance]] and [[legal]] industries to meet the legal requirements for [[financial institutions]] and other regulated entities to prevent or report [[money laundering]] activities.  There are four basic types of software that address anti-money laundering:
transaction monitoring systems, [[currency transaction report]]ing (CTR) systems, customer identity management systems and compliance management software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/anti-money-laundering/anti-money-laundering-software/|title=What Is Anti Money Laundering Software? I ComplyAdvantage|last=|first=|date=|work=ComplyAdvantage|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Anti-money laundering guidelines came into prominence globally after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the subsequent enactment of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] in the United States and the establishment of the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF).  By 2010 many jurisdictions globally required [[financial institutions]] to monitor, investigate and report transactions of a suspicious nature to the financial intelligence unit in their respective country.

An entire industry developed around providing software to analyze transactions in an attempt to identify transactions or patterns of transactions, called [[structuring]], which requires a [[Suspicious activity report|SAR]] filing, or other suspicious patterns that qualify for SAR reporting. Financial institutions faced penalties for failing to properly file CTR and SAR reports, including heavy fines and regulatory restrictions, even to the point of charter revocation.

==Types==
There are four basic types of software addressing AML business requirements:
* Transaction monitoring systems, which focus on identification of suspicious patterns of transactions which may result in the filing of [[Suspicious Activity Report]]s (SARs) or Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs).  Identification of suspicious (as opposed to normal) transactions is part of the KYC requirements.
* [[Currency Transaction Report]]ing (CTR) systems, which deal with large cash transaction reporting requirements ($10,000 and over in the U.S.)
* Customer identity management systems which check various negative lists (such as [[OFAC]]) and represent an initial and ongoing part of [[Know your customer]] (KYC) requirements. Electronic verification can also check against other databases to provide positive confirmation of ID such as (in the UK: electoral roll; the "share" database used by banks and credit agencies; telephone lists; electricity supplier lists; post office delivery database
* Compliance software to help firms comply with AML regulatory requirements; retain the necessary evidence of compliance; and deliver and record appropriate training of relevant staff.  In addition, it should have audit trails of compliance officers activities in particular pertaining to the handling of alerts raised against customer activity. 

===Transaction monitoring software===
These software applications effectively monitor bank customer transactions on a daily basis and, using customer historical information and account profile, provide a "whole picture" to the bank management. Transaction monitoring can include cash deposits and withdrawals, wire transfers and ACH activity. In the bank circles, these applications are known as "AML software".

Each vendor's software works somewhat differently.  Some of the modules which should be present in an AML software are:
*Know Your Customer
*Entity Resolution
*Transaction Monitoring
*Compliance Reporting
*Alert based case management
*Investigation Tools
*Document management to hold the customer related documentation such as account opening package, customer identification documents, etc...
*Delivery of AML Training
*Customer due diligence checks, including electronic verification
*Automated Standard operating procedures e.g. workflow engine/
*Dissemination of AML policies and procedures

===Customer Identity Management Systems===
The definition for Customer Identity Management Systems varies in different regions and jurisdictions. Most vendors include the following features in their solutions:
*Sanction List Check
*Politically Exposed Person (PEP) Check
*False Positive Recording
*Single Scan and Batch Scanning
*Auditing and Reporting

===Machine learning for money laundering detection===
There are solutions based on artificial intelligence, which are characterized by much better efficiency in detecting money laundering, comparing to rule-based approach. Especially, deep neural networks  are able to discover complex interdependencies between various activities performed to launder money. This translates into fewer false alarms and more accurate detection. In the near future, transaction monitoring systems will be based on machine learning rather than on rules and scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In '''''Brenner v. Scott''''' and its companion case, '''''Grimsley v. Scott''''', a U.S. district court found Florida's constitutional and statutory same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional. On August 21, 2014, the court issued a preliminary injunction that prevents that state from enforcing its bans and then stayed its injunction until stays are lifted in the three same-sex marriage cases then petitioning for a [[writ of certiorari]] in the U.S. Supreme Court–''[[Bostic v. Schaefer|Bostic]]'', ''[[Bishop v. Oklahoma|Bishop]]'', and ''[[Kitchen v. Herbert|Kitchen]]''–and for 91 days thereafter. When the district court's preliminary injunction took effect on January 6, 2015, enforcement of Florida's bans on same-sex marriage ended.

The state defendants appealed to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals]], where it was styled ''Brenner v. Armstrong''.

Civil rights attorneys Bill Sheppard ([http://www.sheppardwhite.com Sheppard, White, Kachergus, &amp; DeMaggio P.A]) and Sam Jacobson ([http://www.bledsoejacobson.com Bledsoe, Jacobson, Schmidt, Wright, &amp; Wilkinson]) filed ''Brenner v. Scott'' on behalf of a [[Leon County, Florida]], same-sex couple seeking to have their Canadian marriage recognized by the state. Both plaintiffs in this case are state employees; James Brenner works for the [[Florida state forests|state forest service]] and Charles Jones works in the state [[Florida Department of Education|department of education]]. They complained of being unable to designate each other as a spouse in the state [[pension|retirement benefits]] program because of Florida's nonrecognition of and refusal to license same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Schoettler |first= Jim |date= March 3, 2014 |title= Jacksonville civil rights attorneys challenge Florida laws refusing to recognize same-sex marriages |url=http://members.jacksonville.com/news/crime/2014-03-03/story/jacksonville-civil-rights-attorneys-challenge-florida-laws-refusing |newspaper= [[The Florida Times-Union]] |accessdate= March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2014/03/couple-files-federal-lawsuit-challenging-floridas-ban-on-same-sex-marriage/|title=Couple files federal lawsuit challenging Florida's ban on same-sex marriage |publisher=LGBTQ Nation|date=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second couple (Steven Schlairet &amp; Ozzie Russ) were added to the Brenner suit on March 16, 2014.  Steven is a retired hospital administrator, and Ozzie manages a local fast food restaurant.

''Brenner'' was initially filed on February 28, 2014, and ''Grimsley'' on March 13, 2014. Each case names Florida Governor [[Rick Scott]] as the lead defendant. On April 21, 2014, Judge Hinkle ordered the ''Brenner'' and ''Grimsley'' cases consolidated for case-management purposes, though they remain separate on the docket.

===Ruling===
On August 21, 2014, Judge Hinkle issued a ruling in ''Brenner'' and ''Grimsley'' that granted the same-sex couple plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary [[injunction]]. In ordering the injunction, Judge Hinkle found that Florida's statutory and constitutional bans on same-sex marriage were unconstitutional:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sweeney |first1=Dan|title=Same-sex marriage ban struck down in Florida federal court|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/fl-gay-marriage-federal-court,0,191085.story |accessdate=August 21, 2014|work=Sun-Sentinel|date=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snow |first1=Justin |title=Federal judge rules Florida same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional |url=http://www.metroweekly.com/2014/08/federal-judge-rules-florida-same-sex-marriage-ban-unconstitutional/|accessdate=August 21, 2014|work=Metro Weekly|date=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|This order holds that marriage is a fundamental right as that term is used in cases arising under the Fourteenth Amendment's [[Due Process Clause|Due Process]] and [[Equal Protection Clause]]s, that Florida's same-sex marriage provisions thus must be reviewed under [[strict scrutiny]], and that, when so reviewed, the provisions are unconstitutional.}}

{{quote|The institution of marriage survived when bans on interracial marriage were struck down, and the institution will survive when bans on same-sex marriage are struck down.

Tolerating views with which one disagrees is a hallmark of civilized society.&lt;ref name=Brenner-Order/&gt;}}

===Stay of injunction===
Judge Hinkle's injunction ordered the Secretary of the [[Florida Department of Management Services]] and the [[Florida Department of Health|Florida Surgeon General]] "and their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys" to cease enforcing Florida's ban on same-sex marriage. It also ordered the Clerk of Court of Washington County to issue a marriage license to two of the plaintiffs. He issued a temporary stay of his preliminary injunction, pending resolution of the three same-sex marriage cases that were then petitioning for a [[writ of certiorari]] before the U.S. Supreme Court, and for 91 days thereafter: ''[[Bostic v. Schaefer]]'', ''[[Bishop v. Oklahoma|Bishop v. Smith]]'', and ''[[Kitchen v. Herbert]]''. He also removed the governor and attorney general as defendants.

In a separate part of his injunction, which he did not stay, he ordered the state to revise the death certificate of Carol Goldwasser to include the name of her wife, Arlene Goldberg, one of the plaintiffs. They had married in New York in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stutzman|first1=Rene|title=Tallahassee federal judge throws out Florida's ban on same-sex marriage |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/os-gay-marriage-ban-florida-federal-judge-20140821-story.html |accessdate=October 9, 2014|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 2014, following the U.S. Supreme Court's rejection the previous day of ''certiorari'' in ''Bostic'', ''Bishop'', and ''Kitchen'', the Brenner and Grimsley plaintiffs filed separate motions asking Judge Hinkle to lift his stay before the 91-day period under the original order expired. The state defendants indicated that they object to lifting the stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/242222698/4-14-cv-00107-88 |title=''Brenner v.

On December 23, the Washington County Clerk of Court, whom Hinkle's injunction ordered to issue a marriage license to one of the plaintiff couples, filed an emergency request asking Hinkle if she was also required to issue marriage licenses to all qualified same-sex couples once his injunction took effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=December 23, 2014|website=Scribd.com| publisher=U.S. District Court for Northern Florida|title=Emergency Motion for Clarification|url=https://www.scribd.com/mobile/doc/250893582}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 24, Judge Hinkle issued an order in which he noted that his injunction applied to the Secretary of the Department of Management Services, the Surgeon General, "and their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys—and others in active concert or participation with any of them".

==Court of Appeals proceedings==
With Scott removed as a defendant, Dr. John H. Armstrong, the state's [[Florida Department of Health|Surgeon General and Secretary of Health]] became the lead defendant and the case ''Brenner v.

He and the remaining defendants appealed to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Briefing Notice |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/240579689/14-14061-6-Briefing-Notice|work=U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|publisher=Scribd.com|date=September 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All briefings were completed in December 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=State of Florida: All in this Region: Lawsuits - Pending |url=http://www.marriageequality.org/region_florida |accessdate=January 8, 2015 |work=Marriage Equality USA |date=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the state declined its right to reply to the plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=14-14061 Appellants Reply Notice |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/251566558/14-14061-Appellants-Reply-Notice |accessdate=January 8, 2015 |work=Equality Case Files |date=January 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 4, 2015, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals put its same-sex marriage cases on hold until the Supreme Court rules in pending cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/02/eleventh-circuit-puts-off-same-sex-marriage-cases/ |publisher=SCOTUSblog |accessdate=February 5, 2015| date= February 5, 2015| first= Lyle |last=Denniston | title= Eleventh Circuit puts off same-sex marriage cases}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of Florida has dropped their appeal in the Brenner v. Armstrong case with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Despite same-sex marriage being legal in Florida, as of February 2016 the case is still awaiting a final injunction order in the Northern District Court from Judge Hinkle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/florida/sfl-florida-lawmakers-leave-gay-marriage-ban-on-books-20160215-story.html|title=Florida lawmakers leave gay marriage ban on books|date=15 February 2016|work=Sun Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. Supreme Court==

On October 6, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court denied [[certiorari]] without recorded dissent in all the cases it had been asked to consider from appellate courts in the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits, allowing the circuit court decisions striking down marriage bans to stand. The cases were: ''[[Baskin v. Bogan|Bogan v. Baskin]]'' (Indiana); ''[[Wolf v. Walker|Walker v. Wolf]]'' (Wisconsin); ''[[Herbert v. Kitchen]]'' (Utah); ''[[Bostic v. Schaefer|McQuigg v.

On November 13, commenting in an unrelated case on behalf of himself and Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote that the Supreme Court "often review[s] decisions striking down state laws, even in the absence of a disagreement among lower courts.... But for reasons that escape me, we have not done so with any consistency, especially in recent months". He referenced denials of certiorari or denials of a stay in ''Herbert'', ''Bishop'', ''Bostic'', ''Walker v. Wolf'', ''Otter v. Latta'', and ''Parnell v. Hamby''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On Application for Stay: ''Maricopa County v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7844">The '''California Fair Employment and Housing Act of 1959''', codified as Government Code §§12900 - 12996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/california_fair_employment_and_housing_act_feha_government_code_12900_12996|title=California Fair Employment and Housing Act - FEHA - Government Code 12900 - 12996 - findUSlaw|website=finduslaw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a powerful California statute used to fight [[sexual harassment]] and other forms of unlawful [[discrimination]] in [[employment]] and [[House|housing]], which was passed on September 18, 1959.

==Scope==
The FEHA is the principal [[California]] [[statute]] prohibiting [[employment discrimination]] covering employers, [[labor organizations]], employment agencies, apprenticeship programs and any person or entity who aids, abets, incites, compels, or coerces the doing of a discriminatory act. It prohibits [[employment discrimination]] based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or color; [[religion]]; national origin or ancestry, physical [[disability]]; [[Mental disability (disambiguation)|mental disability]] or medical condition; marital status; sex or [[sexual orientation]]; age, with respect to persons over the age of 40; and pregnancy, [[childbirth]], or related medical conditions. The FEHA also prohibits retaliation against anyone for opposing any practice forbidden by the Act or for filing a complaint, testifying, or assisting in proceedings under the FEHA.

An amendment passed in 1978 requires employers to provide an unpaid job-protected leave to employees disabled by pregnancy (also known as "pregnancy disability leave") for up to four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/479/272.html|title = FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|website = Findlaw|access-date = 2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legality of this statute and its consistency with federal law was upheld by the Supreme Court in ''[[California Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Guerra]]'' (1987). After the passage of the federal [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978]], pregnant employees in California also became eligible to receive temporary disability insurance benefits under the [[California State Disability Insurance]] program.

==Purpose==
Various individual states within the [[United States]] have anti-discrimination laws which sometimes differ from [[federal law]]; these laws are provided in addition to the federal law, and may offer more desirable avenues to victims of harassment and discrimination.

The FEHA was adopted with the stated purpose of providing effective remedies to eliminate certain types of employment discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Government Code § 12920|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&amp;sectionNum=12920|website=California Legislative Information|publisher=California State Legislature|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
California law and the FEHA also allow for the imposition of [[punitive damages]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californialawyerassociates.com/2011/03/why-california%E2%80%99s-feha-is-used-in-most-discrimination-cases/|title=Why California’s FEHA is used in Most Discrimination Cases|publisher=|access-date=2011-10-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814210642/http://www.californialawyerassociates.com/2011/03/why-california%E2%80%99s-feha-is-used-in-most-discrimination-cases/#|archive-date=2011-08-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tosdalsmith.com/agediscrim.html|title=TSSW: Employment Law Specialists|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a corporate defendant's officers, directors or managing agents engage in harassment, discrimination, or retaliation, or when such persons approve or consciously disregard prohibited conduct by lower-level employees in violation of the rights or safety of the [[plaintiff]] or others.

The [[California Court of Appeals]] opinion in the landmark sexual harassment case of ''Weeks. v. Baker &amp; McKenzie''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/data2/californiastatecases/a068499.doc|title=FindLaw's California Court of Appeal case and opinions.|website=Findlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a good example of how the FEHA works to protect employees in California. Settlements in FEHA cases can actually be quite complex and require complex negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gjel.com/news/feha-cases.html|title=Beware of the "Fine Print": Settlement Agreements in FEHA Cases - GJEL Accident Attorneys|date=19 August 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alston.com/laborandemploymentblog/blog.aspx?entry=3733|title=RECOVERING EXPERT FEES FROM FEHA PLAINTIFFS: ANOTHER SLIGHT TIP OF THE SCALES IN FAVOR OF CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Whether seeking an investigation under FEHA or a suit in court, the process usually begins with the victim filing a complaint&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/complaints/Default.aspx|title=DFEH.ca.gov|publisher=|access-date=2008-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128213519/http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/complaints/Default.aspx#|archive-date=2008-01-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of discrimination with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/|title=DFEH – Dept Fair Employment &amp; Housing|first=State of|last=California|website=www.dfeh.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeocoffice.com/States/california/california.htm|title=Address, phone, and contact information for California EEOC offices and California state employment agencies.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|Castle law|the hill in Scotland|Castle Law}}
A '''castle doctrine''', also known as a '''castle law''' or a '''defense of habitation law''', is a legal doctrine that designates a person's abode or any legally occupied place (for example, a vehicle or home) as a place in which that person has protections and immunities permitting one, in certain circumstances, to use force (up to and including [[deadly force]]) to defend oneself against an intruder, free from legal prosecution for the consequences of the force used.&lt;ref name=njsd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2008/Bills/A0500/159_I1.PDF|title=Assembly, No. 159, State of New Jersey, 213th Legislature, The "New Jersey Self Defense Law"| date= May 6, 2008| quote=The "Castle Doctrine" is a long-standing American legal concept arising from English Common Law that provides that one's abode is a special area in which one enjoys certain protections and immunities, that one is not obligated to retreat before defending oneself against attack, and that one may do so without fear of prosecution. |accessdate=2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most commonly used in the [[United States]], though many other countries{{which|date=November 2017}} invoke comparable principles in their laws.

A person may have a [[duty to retreat]] to avoid violence if one can reasonably do so. Castle doctrines lessen the duty to retreat when an individual is assaulted within one's own home. Deadly force may either be [[justifiable homicide|justified]], the [[Prima facie|burdens of production]] and [[Burden of proof (law)|proof]] for charges impeded, or an [[affirmative defense]] against [[criminal homicide]] applicable, in cases "when the actor reasonably fears [[imminent peril]] of death or serious bodily harm to him or herself or another".&lt;ref name=njsd/&gt; The castle doctrine is not a defined law that can be invoked, but a set of principles which may be incorporated in some form in many jurisdictions. Castle doctrines may not provide civil immunity, such as from [[wrongful death]] suits, which have a much lower [[Burden of proof (law)|burden of proof]].

Justifiable homicide&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelawdictionary.org/homicide-justifiable/#ixzz2aUEbR0HM Black's Law Dictionary]: This term applies to the blameless killing of a person, such as in self-defense.&lt;/ref&gt; in self-defense which happens to occur inside one's home is distinct, as [[question of law|a matter of law]], from castle doctrine because the mere occurrence of [[trespassing]]—and occasionally a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] requirement of fear—is sufficient to invoke the castle doctrine, the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] of [[Fact (law)|fact]] is much less challenging than that of justifying a homicide in self-defense. With justifiable homicide in self-defense, one generally must [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]] prove to a [[trier of fact]], against [[Legal burden of proof#Beyond reasonable doubt|all reasonable doubt]], the [[Intent (law)|intent]] in the intruder's mind to commit [[violence]] or a [[felony]]. It would be a misconception of law to infer that because a state has a justifiable homicide in self-defense provision pertaining to one's [[Domicile (law)|domicile]], it has a castle doctrine protecting the estate and exonerating any duty whatsoever to retreat therefrom. The doctrine can be misused as a [[pretext]] for [[extrajudicial punishment]] in private spaces. The use of this legal principle in the United States has been controversial in relation to a number of cases in which it has been invoked, including the deaths of Japanese exchange student [[Yoshihiro Hattori]] and Scottish businessman [[Andrew de Vries]].

==History==
The legal concept of the inviolability of the home has been known in [[Western civilization]] since the age of the [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges]], ''The Ancient City'', 50. "To enter this house with any malevolent intention was a sacrilege. The domicile was inviolable."&lt;/ref&gt; In [[English common law]] the term is derived from the dictum that "'''an Englishman's home is his castle'''" (see ''[[Semayne's case]]''). This concept was established as English law by the 17th century jurist [[Sir Edward Coke]], in his ''The Institutes of the Laws of England'', 1628:&lt;ref name="phrases1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/an-englishmans-home-is-his-castle.html |title=An Englishman's home is his castle |publisher=Phrases.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For a man's house is his castle, et domus sua cuique est tutissimum refugium [and each man's home is his safest refuge].&lt;ref name="phrases1"/&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

English common law came with colonists to the New World, where it has become known as the castle doctrine.&lt;ref name="phrases1"/&gt; The term has been used in England to imply a person's absolute right to exclude anyone from their home, although this has always had restrictions, such as [[bailiff]]s having increasing powers of entry since the late-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Philip Johnston |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/philipjohnston/4218091/An-Englishmans-home-is-no-longer-his-castle.html |title=An Englishman's home is no longer his castle |publisher=Telegraph |date= 11 January 2009|accessdate=2012-01-11 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 18th-century Presbyterian minister and biblical commentator [[Matthew Henry]], the prohibition of murder found in the [[Old Testament]] contains an exception for legitimate self-defense.  A home defender who struck and killed a thief caught in the act of breaking in at night was not guilty of bloodshed.  "If a thief is caught breaking in and is struck so that he dies, the thief owes no blood-debt to the home-defender; but if the thief lives, he owes a blood-debt to the home-defender and must make restitution."&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:2-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0222.htm|title=Exodus 22 / Hebrew - English Bible / Mechon-Mamre|website=www.mechon-mamre.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the early United States ===
[[File:Auction-storage-no-trespassing-sign-tn1.jpg|thumbnail|"Trespassers will be shot" sign]]

By the 18th century, many US state legal systems began by importing English common law such as Acts of Parliament of 2 Ed. III ([[Statute of Northampton]]), and 5 Rich. II ([[Forcible Entry Act 1381]]) in law since 1381—which imposed criminal sanctions intending to discourage the resort to self-help.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/CACourts/ ''Dickinson v. Maguire,'' 9 Cal. 46],  The [[Chief Justice of California]] during the ruling was [[David S. Terry]], who ironically, was later killed by order of [[Stephen Johnson Field|
Associate Supreme Court Justice Field]] under the guise of self-defense.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/daluiso-v-boone-27416 Daluiso v. Boone, 71 Cal.2d 484] for English common law history&lt;/ref&gt; This required a threatened party to retreat, whenever property was "involved" and resolve the issue by civil means.

Then as now, there were English politicians who were for or against the use of self-help over state-help. [[William Blackstone]], in Book 4, Chapter 16&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch16.htm Blackstone's Commentaries - Book the Fourth - Chapter the Sixteenth : Of Offenses Against the Habitations of Individuals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503193949/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch16.htm |date=2008-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Some doctrines would be hotly debated as law as applied in the young post-revolution United States. Example: "That the King can do no wrong, is a necessary and fundamental principle of the English constitution."&lt;/ref&gt; proclaims that the laws "leave him (the inhabitant) the natural right of killing the aggressor (the burglar)" and goes on to generalize in the following words:

{{quote|text=And the law of England has so particular and tender a regard to the immunity of a man's house, that it stiles it his castle, and will never suffer it to be violated with immunity: agreeing herein with the sentiments of ancient Rome, as expressed in the works of Tully;&lt;ref&gt;"Tully" was once a common abbreviation for Marcus Tullius [[Cicero]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''quid enim sanctius, quid omni religione munitius, quam domus uniusquisque civium?''&lt;ref&gt;''What is more sacred, what more strongly guarded by every holy feeling, than a man's own home?''&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason no doors can in general be broken open to execute any civil process; though, in criminal causes, the public safety supersedes the private. Hence also in part arises the [[animadversion]] of the law upon eaves-droppers, nuisancers, and incendiaries: and to this principle it must be assigned, that a man may assemble people together lawfully without danger of raising a riot, rout, or unlawful assembly, in order to protect and defend his house; which he is not permitted to do in any other case.|sign=[[William Blackstone]] |source=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]}}

Not only was the doctrine considered to justify defense against neighbors and criminals, but any of the Crown's agents who attempted to enter without a proper warrant as well. It should be noted that prohibitions of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] share a common background with current castle doctrine laws.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In 1841, The [[Preemption Act]] was passed to "appropriate the proceeds of the sales of public lands... and to grant 'pre-emption rights' to individuals" who were already living on federal lands (commonly referred to as "[[Squatting in the United States|squatters]]"). During this same period, [[claim club]]s sprung up all over the US advocating [[Alertness|vigilance]] and the castle doctrine. This was in concurrence with the culture of [[manifest destiny]] which led to [[westward expansion]] and the [[American Indian Wars]], the last of which ended by the [[Battle of Bear Valley|1920s]].

=== On the American frontier===
On the [[American frontier]], the doctrine of no duty to retreat extended outside a residence. It asserted that a man in an altercation that he did not provoke was not obliged to flee from his attacker, but was free to stand his ground and defend himself. A state Supreme Court justice wrote in 1877,&lt;ref name=jay2006&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jay|first1=Roger|title=Spitting Lead in Leadville: Doc Holliday's Last Stand |url=http://www.historynet.com/spitting-lead-in-leadville-doc-hollidays-last-stand.htm|website=HistoryNet|publisher=Wild West Magazine|accessdate=13 April 2015|date=August 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Indeed, the tendency of the American mind seems to be very strongly against the enforcement of any rule which requires a person to flee when assailed.}}

American West historian Richard M. Brown wrote that under the circumstances, for a man in the American West to flee under such circumstances would be cowardly and un-American. 
Legendary dentist and gambler [[Doc Holliday]] successfully used this defense when he shot Billy Allen as he entered a saloon. Holliday owed Allen $5 which Allen wanted paid and had threatened Holliday. Although Allen was unarmed at the time, Holliday had received reports that Allen had been armed and looking for him earlier in the day. During the subsequent trial, Holliday asserted he was within his rights and the jury agreed. He was acquitted on March 28, 1885.&lt;ref name=jay2006/&gt;

Each jurisdiction incorporates the castle doctrine into its laws in different ways. The circumstance in which it may be invoked include the premises covered (abode only, or other places too), the degree of retreat or non-deadly resistance required before deadly force can be used, etc. Typical conditions that apply to some castle doctrine laws include:{{Citation needed|date=January 2012|reason=for each of these points}}

* An intruder must be making (or have made) an attempt to unlawfully or forcibly enter an occupied residence, business, or vehicle.
* The intruder must be acting unlawfully (the castle doctrine does not allow a right to use force against officers of the law, acting in the course of their legal duties).
* The occupant(s) of the home must reasonably believe the intruder intends to inflict serious bodily harm or death upon an occupant of the home. Some states apply the Castle Doctrine if the occupant(s) of the home reasonably believe the intruder intends to commit a lesser felony such as arson or burglary.
* The occupant(s) of the home must not have provoked or instigated an intrusion; or, provoked/instigated an intruder's threat or use of deadly force.  In all cases, the occupant(s) of the home: must be there legally; must not be fugitives from the law, themselves, or aiding/abetting other fugitives; and must not use force upon an officer of the law performing a legal duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reinhart|first1=Christopher|title=CASTLE DOCTRINE AND SELF-DEFENSE|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2007/rpt/2007-r-0052.htm|website=www.cga.ct.gov|publisher=State of Connecticut|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Colorado, the make-my-day statute provides the occupant with immunity from prosecution only for force used against a person who has made an unlawful entry into the dwelling, but not against a person who remains unlawfully in the dwelling.&lt;ref&gt;People v. Drennon, 860 P.2d 589 (Colo. Ct. App. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="People v. McNeese 1995"&gt;People v. McNeese, 892 P.2d 304 (Colo. 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immunity from civil lawsuit===
In addition to providing a valid defense in criminal law, many laws implementing the castle doctrine, particularly those with a "stand-your-ground clause," also have a clause which provides immunity from any ''civil'' lawsuits filed on behalf of the assailant (for damages/injuries resulting from the force used to stop them). Without this clause, an assailant could sue for medical bills, property damage, disability, and pain &amp; suffering as a result of the injuries inflicted by the defender; or, if the force results in the assailant's death, his/her next-of-kin or estate could launch a [[wrongful death]] suit. Even if successfully rebutted, the defendant (the homeowner/defender) may still have to pay high legal costs leading up to the suit's dismissal.  Without criminal/civil immunity, such civil action could be used as revenge against a lawfully acting defender (who was, originally, the assailant's victim).

Use of force in self-defense which causes damage or injuries to other, non-criminally-acting parties, may not be shielded from criminal or civil prosecution, however.

===Duty to retreat===
In US jurisdictions where the castle doctrine applies, there is no [[duty to retreat]] before deadly force is used against an intruder by a person in their home or, in some jurisdictions, just simply where the person can legally be.&lt;ref name=2007-R-0052&gt;Rhinehart, C, [http://www.cga.ct.gov/2007/rpt/2007-R-0052.htm Castle Doctrine and Self-Defense] Connecticut General Assembly, Office of Legislative Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stand-your-ground===
{{main|Stand-your-ground law}}
Most states in the United States have stand-your-ground laws where individuals can use deadly force in any location one is legally allowed to be without first attempting to retreat.

===Culpability of intruder===
In Colorado, the make-my-day statute "was not intended to justify use of physical force against persons who enter a dwelling accidentally or in good faith."&lt;ref name="People v. McNeese 1995"/&gt; In other words, "the unlawful entry element requires a culpable mental state of 'knowingly' on the part of the intruder."&lt;ref&gt;People v. Zukowski, 260 P.3d 339 (Colo. Ct. App. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

A list of states and their most applicable body of law to justifying homicide in protection of the abode is listed below. Because not all states truly invoke castle doctrine, [[justifiable homicide |justifiable homicide in defense of life]]—which is nearly universal in adoption, but with narrower application—is often what is invoked as a [[pretext]] to protect the home. However, the mere fact that one is trespassing is an inappropriate or inadequate defense [[per se (terminology)|per se]] to justifying homicide in many states.&lt;ref name="forbidden force"/&gt;

===States incorporating castle doctrine principles===
The castle doctrine in its traditional absolute and [[extrajudicial]] form is antiquated in most states. However, its vestige saliently remains as a set of principles which are incorporated to a variegated extent through both [[statutory law|statutory]] and [[case law]]. It is commonly manifested as an [[affirmative defense]] to criminal homicide that occurred within a home;&lt;ref name=Randall/&gt; in some states though it slightly enhances the conditions for justifiable homicide in self-defense by laying down no duty to retreat or avert a violent encounter, or by even granting a blanket rebuttable [[presumption]] of required killing in defense of life. Where principles are statutized in a [[penal code]], a homicide may be excused criminally, but be a [[wrongful death]] civilly. In a strict sense, simple [[justifiable homicide]] in self-defense which happens to occur inside one's home is actually distinct as a  matter of law from castle doctrine's no duty to retreat in defense of one's domicile. Self-defense protects life while castle doctrine defends estate. While most American states forbid the use of force in the recovery of possession of land,&lt;ref name="forbidden force"/&gt; a minority of jurisdictions do invoke pure castle doctrine which unconditionally authorizes violent self-help in protection of one's domicile. States still espousing the archaic form tend to be conservative, or have unique issues such as a primarily rural population in a harsh or adverse environment which critically demands high broad skill in self-reliance. It is invoked in areas often associated with small local governments and very long response times from law enforcement. Dense urban jurisdictions repeatedly find that injustices, mistakes, and avoidable escalation from violent self-help often outweigh any benefit, especially when potential occurrences are frequent, initial police response is usually less than 7–15 minutes away, and legal remedies are local.

Chapter 5 § 505] || The most recent version of Pennsylvania's Castle Doctrine legislation was signed into law in June 2011.  The law extends the right to self-defense up to and including deadly force in a victim's dwelling (now including any attached porch, deck or patio), occupied vehicle, or any other dwelling or vehicle that the victim legally occupies.  A place of work is included in the "castle" provision under certain circumstances.  Use of deadly force is justifiable if the "castle" area in the event that an assailant is "unlawfully and forcefully entering" or has entered the "castle" area.  Deadly force is also justifiable, subject to certain provisions, if a person that legally enters the "castle" goes on to unlawfully attack a victim (when the victim is resonably in fear of his/her life) or if the attacker attempts to kidnap anyone who legally occupies the "castle".    The victim must be in "legal possession" of a firearm or other weapon to be justified in the use of that weapon.  Use of deadly force to protect an innocent third person is generally allowed in circumstances where the provisions for justifiable self-defense are met.  Victims who justifiably use force to defend themselves under the provisions of the law are immune from civil liability for any injuries sustained by the attacker during the incident. The new legislation also contains a stand your ground provision when outside the "castle".  Outside "castle areas" there is no duty to retreat if confronted with a weapon.

-
Legitimate Defense.
A person does not incur criminal liability when defending his person, his home, his property or
rights, or person, dwelling, property or rights of others when the person reasonably believes that imminent damage is to be expected,
provided that there is a rational need for the means of impeding or repelling the damage, and it can be shown that there isn't sufficient evidence
that the person exercising the defense provoked the aggressor, and that the means of exercising the defense did not exceed the means necessary to
repel or avoid the damage.

When self-defense is claimed to justify killing a human being, it is necessary to have founded grounds to believe that by killing the
aggressor, the victim of the aggression or the person being defended from the aggressor was in imminent or immediate danger of death or serious
bodily harm. To justify the defense of the abode, the circumstances must indicate an illegal entry or that the person in the dwelling had a reasonable
belief that a crime will be committed. To justify the defense of property or rights, the circumstances must indicate an attack on them
which results in a criminal offense or puts them in serious danger of imminent deterioration or loss.

A new law passed in April 2018 expanded castle doctrine protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.primerahora.com/noticias/gobierno-politica/nota/defensoresdelasarmascelebrannuevaleydedoctrinadelcastillo-1278342/|title=Defensores de las armas celebran nueva ley de doctrina del castillo|date=2018-04-18|work=Primera Hora|access-date=2018-08-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===States with weak or no specific castle law===
These states uphold castle doctrine in general, but may rely on case law instead of specific legislation, may enforce a duty to retreat, and may impose specific restrictions on the use of deadly force:
*District of Columbia
*Nebraska - a bill was introduced in January 2012 that allowed deadly force against a person who broke into a house or occupied vehicle or who tried to kidnap someone from a house or vehicle; however, the bill was revised to include only an [[affirmative defense]] from lawsuits pertaining to justifiable use of force.&lt;ref name="neb bill cut up"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.southwestiowanews.com/council_bluffs/news/around_the_region/article_2148734e-79b4-11e1-b16e-001a4bcf887a.html |title=150 at rally over death of Florida teen|work=The Daily Nonpariel|date= March 29, 2012|author=Moring, Rosann|accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=28-1409|title=Nebraska Legislature|last=LTC|website=nebraskalegislature.gov|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*New Mexico - Limited Castle Doctrine for self-defense inside one's home established by court precedence in ''State v. Couch'' (1946).  No civil immunity from potential lawsuits by the aggressor or surviving relatives.  In 2011, two bills (House Bill 228 and Senate Bill 29) would have granted civil immunity to individuals who lawfully use lethal force in self-defense, both bills died in their respective chambers of the [[New Mexico Legislature]].
*South Dakota - "Homicide is justifiable if committed by any person while resisting any attempt to murder such person, or to commit any felony upon him or her, or upon or in any dwelling house in which such person is."

==Outside the US==

===Australia===

Australian states have differing [[Self-defence (Australia)|self-defence laws]]. Under South Australian law, the general defence appears in s15(1) Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) for defending a person's life, and s15A(1) for defending property, subject to a hybrid test, i.e. the defendant honestly believed the threat to be imminent and made an objectively reasonable and proportionate response to the circumstances as the accused subjectively perceived them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Law Consolidation (Self Defence) Amendment Act 2003|url=http://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/V/A/2003/CRIMINAL%20LAW%20CONSOLIDATION%20%28SELF%20DEFENCE%29%20AMENDMENT%20ACT%202003_28/2003.28.UN.PDF|publisher=Government of South Australia|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2003, the Rann Government (SA) introduced laws allowing householders to use "whatever force they deem necessary" when confronted with a home invader. Householders who kill or injure a home invader escape prosecution provided they can prove they had a genuine belief that it was necessary to do so to protect themselves or their family. The law was strongly opposed by then-Director of Public Prosecutions Paul Rofe, QC, and lawyer Marie Shaw, who is now a District Court Judge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,21134744-2682,00.html Accused to argue self defence | adelaidenow].

=== Brazil (self-defence of possession) ===
Since 1917, with the enacting of the first Brazilian Civil Code, a possessor of a thing, moveable or immoveable, is allowed, in case of disturbance ("turbação") or expulsion ("esbulho"), to "maintain or to reintegrate himself [at the possession of a thing] using its own force, as well as he does it soon". The acts of force employed by the possessor shall not exceed the necessary ones for eliminating the disturbance or for reintegration (Article 502 of the former Civil Code; Federal Ordinary Law 3.071/1917).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/Ccivil_03/leis/L3071impressao.htm|title=L3071impressao|website=www.planalto.gov.br|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This possibility remained untouched on the Brazilian Civil Code of 2002 (Federal Ordinary Law 10.406/2002), in its Article 1.210.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/CCivil_03/leis/2002/L10406.htm|title=L10406|website=www.planalto.gov.br|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-defence of possession is not allowed for the cases of threat ("ameaça"). It is needed for the possessor to be effectively and physically disturbed in its possession ("turbação") or completely severed from it ("esbulho"). A possessor acting under the prescriptions of the Article 1.210 of the Civil Code shall be exempt of any civil or criminal responsibility. In terms of Tort Law, Article 188, inc. I, of the Civil Code states that is not an unlawful act "the regular exercise of a right recognized by the law".

===Canada===

According to the Criminal Code of Canada Sections 34 and 35,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-6.html#h-9|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Criminal Code|first=Legislative Services|last=Branch|website=lois-laws.justice.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which were updated in 2012 with the passage of bill C-26) force, up to and including lethal force may be used in defence of one's life or "peaceably" possessed property or the defence of another's life or "peaceably" possessed property, and is not considered an offence so long as the person believes that force is being used against them in the case of self-defence, that someone is about to or has broken into or damaged property in the case of defence of property, that they are acting in defence of themselves, someone else or "peaceably" possessed property, and that the act is reasonable in the circumstances. The criminal code also lays out the factors in either case that will be used to determine what constitutes "reasonable given the circumstances". The changes made by the government were to clarify the laws involving self-defence and defence of property, and to help legal professionals to apply the law as believed to reflect the values Canadians hold to be acceptable.

===Ireland===
Under the terms of the Defence and the Dwelling Act enacted in 2011, property owners or residents are entitled to defend themselves with force, up to and including lethal force.  Any individual who uses force against a trespasser is not guilty of an offense if he or she honestly believes they were there to commit a criminal act and a threat to life. However, there is a further provision which requires that the reaction to the intruder is such that another reasonable person in the same circumstances would likely employ.  This provision acts as a safeguard against grossly disproportionate use of force, while still allowing a person to use force in nearly all circumstances.

The law was introduced in response to [[Death of John Ward|DPP v.

Italy passed a law in 2005 that would allow property owners to defend themselves with force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4645228.stm Italy approves self-defence law ], BBCX, January 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The law's practical application is however highly controversial: Italian judiciary system is rather complex and using force is, more often than not, not recommended at all, since the property owner might get sued for disproportionate use of force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diritto.it/docs/21686-la-riforma-della-legittima-difesa] Diritto.it, commentary on the law&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Communication rights''' involve [[freedom of opinion]] and [[Freedom of expression|expression]], [[democracy|democratic]] [[Media (communication)|media]] [[governance]], [[media ownership]] and media control, participation in one's own culture, [[linguistic rights]], [[right to education|rights to education]], [[right to privacy|privacy]],  [[Right to assemble|assemble]], and [[right to self-determination|self-determination]].  They are also related [[social exclusion|inclusion and exclusion]],  quality and [[accessibility]] to  means of communication.&lt;ref name=WACCA&gt;[http://centreforcommunicationrights.org/index.php/introduction.html What are communication rights?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109023820/http://centreforcommunicationrights.org/index.php/introduction.html |date=2014-11-09 }} How do they relate to [[human rights]]? How do they differ from  [[freedom of expression]] ? Centre for Communication Rights. [[World Association for Christian Communication|WACC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A "right to communicate" and "communication rights" are closely related, but not identical. The former is more associated with the [[New World Information and Communication Order]] debate, and points to the need for a formal legal acknowledgment of such a right, as an overall framework for more effective implementation. The latter emphasizes the fact that an array of international rights underpinning communication already exists, but many are often ignored and require active mobilization and assertion.&lt;ref name=WACCA /&gt;

==History==
The concept of the right to communicate began in 1969 with [[Jean D’Arcy]], a pioneer in French and European television in the 1950s and by 1969 Director of the United Nations Radio and Visual Services Division, where he was involved in international policy discussions arising out of the recent innovations in satellite global communications.  He recognized that the communication rights relating to freedom of expression embodied in the U. N. [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) adopted in 1948 would need to be re-examined in the context of global, interactive communication between individuals and communities. He called for the need for the recognition of a human right to communicate that would encompass earlier established rights.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arcy, Jean - [http://righttocommunicate.com/?q=node/117  The Right to Communicate] (edited by L. S. Harms).&lt;/ref&gt;  He thus was the first to link communication and ''universal'' human rights. His call was taken up by academics, policy experts, and public servants who evolved into the [[Right to Communicate Group]], the many non-governmental and civil society organisations that made up the Platform for Co-operation on Communication and Democratisation, and the Communication Rights in the Information Society (CRIS) Campaign.

The first broad-based debate on media and communication globally, limited mainly to governments, ran for a decade from the mid-1970s. Governments of the South, by then a majority in the UN, began voicing demands in [[UNESCO]] concerning media concentration, the flow of news, and ‘[[cultural imperialism]]’. The MacBride Report (1981) studied the problem, articulating a general ‘right to communicate’. The debate was compromised, however, by Cold War rhetoric, and fell apart after the US and the UK pulled out of UNESCO.

The ''MacBride Report'' became unavailable until the [[World Association for Christian Communication]] (WACC) sponsored its republication in 1988. WACC held the secretariat of the CRIS Campaign 2000–05.

Interest in the right to communicate languished during the 1980s as there was no mass movement to promote it for the simple reason few people had direct experience with interactive communication over global electronic networks.  This situation changed dramatically in the 1990s with a cluster of innovations that included the Internet, the World Wide Web, search engines, availability of personal computers, and social networking.  As more people participated in interactive communication and the many challenges it raised in regard to such communication rights as free of speech, privacy, and freedom of information, they began to develop a growing consciousness of the importance of such rights to their ability to communicate.

A result of this growing communicative consciousness is a renewed research interest in and political advocacy for a right to communicate (see references).  From the 1990s onwards, NGOs and activists{{Who|date=December 2012}} became increasingly active in a variety of communication issues, from community media, to language rights, to copyright, to Internet provision and free and open source software. These coalesced in a number of umbrella groups tackling inter-related issues from which the pluralistic notion of communication rights began to take shape, this time from the ground up.

==Four pillars==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Each Pillar [of Communication Rights] relates to a different domain of social existence, experience and practice, in which communication is a core activity and performs key functions. The {{sic|rational}} for the four [pillars is,] that each involves a ''relatively autonomous sphere of social action'', yet ''depends on the others'' for achieving its ultimate goal - they are necessary interlocking blocks in the struggle to achieve communication rights. Action can be coherently pursued under, each, often in collaboration with other social actors concerned with the area more generally; while bridges can and must be built to the other areas if the goal is to be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Ó Siochrú | 2005 | p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Communicating in the public sphere===
"The role of communication and media in exercising democratic political participation in society."&lt;ref name="Ó Siochrú 2005 41"&gt;{{Harvnb | Ó Siochrú | 2005 | p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication knowledge===
"The terms and means by which knowledge generated by society is communicated, or blocked, for use by different groups."&lt;ref name="Ó Siochrú 2005 41"/&gt;

===Civil rights in communication===
"The exercise of civil rights relating to the processes of communication in society."&lt;ref name="Ó Siochrú 2005 41"/&gt;

===Cultural rights in communication===
"The communication of diverse cultures, cultural forms and identities at the individual and social levels."&lt;ref name="Ó Siochrú 2005 41"/&gt;

==Right to communicate vs. communication rights==
A ‘right to communicate’ and ‘communication rights’ are closely related, but not identical, in their history and usage. In the Cold War tensions of the 1970s and 1980s, the former became associated with the [[New World Information and Communication Order]] (NWICO) debate, thus, efforts within UNESCO to formulate such a right were abandoned.  The latter emphasizes the fact that an array of international rights underpinning communication already exists, but many are too often ignored and require active mobilisation and assertion.  While some, especially within the [[mass media]] sector, still see the right to communicate as a "code word" for state [[censorship]],the technological innovations in interactive electronic, global communication of recent decades are seen by others as challenging the traditional mass media structures and formulations of communication rights values arising from them, thereby renewing the need to re-consider the need for a right to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;These issues are explored more fully in Raboy's and Shtern's  ''Media Divides: Communication rights and the right to communicate in Canada'' (2010) and Dakroury, Eid, &amp; Kamalipour (Eds.), ''The right to communicate: Historical hopes, global debates, and future premises.'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Competition Bureau''' ({{lang-fr|Bureau de la concurrence}}) is an independent [[Canada|Canadian]] [[law enforcement agency]] that ensures that markets operate in a competitive, innovative manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/h_00125.html Competition Bureau - Our Organization]&lt;/ref&gt;

Headed by the Commissioner of Competition, the Bureau is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the ''[[Competition Act]]'', the ''Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act'', the ''Textile Labelling Act'' and the ''Precious Metals Marking Act''.

==Commissioner==

The current Interim Commissioner of Competition is Matthew Boswell. He served as Senior Deputy Commissioner of Competition before being appointed to his current position.

The Commissioner is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the ''Competition Act'' and three labelling statutes, the ''Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act'', the ''Precious Metals Marking Act'' and the ''Textile Labelling Act''.

Under the ''Competition Act'', the Commissioner can launch inquiries, challenge civil and merger matters before the [[Competition Tribunal]], make recommendations on criminal matters to the [[Public Prosecution Service of Canada]], and intervene as a competition advocate before federal and provincial bodies.

As head of the Canadian Competition Bureau, the Commissioner leads the Bureau's participation in international fora such as the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[International Competition Network]] (ICN), to develop and promote coordinated competition laws and policies in an increasingly globalized marketplace.

==Branches==

===Mergers and Monopolisitc Practices Branch===

The Mergers and Monopolistic Practices Branch reviews proposed merger transactions and investigates practices that could negatively impact competition. The Mergers Directorate reviews proposed mergers to assess whether the transactions are likely to substantially prevent or lessen competition in the marketplace. The Monopolistic Practices Directorate detects, investigates and deters business practices that have a negative impact on competition, such as abuse of dominance, as well as certain types of anti‑competitive agreements or arrangements between competitors.

===Cartels and Deceptive Marketing Practices Branch===

The Cartels and Deceptive Marketing Practices Branch fights criminal or deceptive business practices that hurt consumers and competition in the marketplace. The Cartels Directorate detects, investigates and deters genuine cartels, including conspiracies, agreements or arrangements among competitors and potential competitors to fix prices, rig bids, allocate markets or restrict supply. The Directorate also reaches out to stakeholders engaged in procurement to enable them to detect and deter bid-rigging and other cartel activities.The Deceptive Marketing Practices Directorate detects, investigates and deters false or misleading representations and deceptive marketing practices identified under the Competition Act. The Directorate also enforces related legislation, i.e. the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act (except as it relates to food), the Precious Metals Marking Act and the Textile Labelling Act.

===Competition Promotion Branch===

The Competition Promotion Branch encourages the adoption of pro-competition positions, policies, and behaviors by businesses, consumers, regulators, government and international partners. The Branch also provides economic analysis in support of enforcement, and leads the Bureau's planning and reporting processes. Also within this branch is the International Affairs Directorate, which establishes working relationships with foreigns competition law agencies and tribunals.

===Corporate Services Branch===

The Corporate Services Branch provides advice, planning and services for the effective operation of the Bureau's financial, asset, information management and human resource activities, as well as access to information, privacy, values and ethics, security and procurement matters. The Branch also provides expertise in complaint management and evidence collection and preservation in support of the Bureau's mandate.

===Legal Support===

====Competition Bureau Legal Services (DOJ)====

The Competition Bureau Legal Services of the Department of Justice is responsible for providing legal services to the Commissioner and for representing the Commissioner on all matters other than those for which the Public Prosecution Service of Canada is responsible.

====Competition Law Section (PPSC)====

The Competition Law Section of the Public Prosecution Service of Canada is responsible for initiating and conducting criminal prosecutions on behalf of the [[Attorney General of Canada]] and for advising the Bureau on criminal investigations.

[[File:Concreteblocks.jpg|thumb|A [[pallet]] of "8-inch" CMUs]]
[[File:Painted breeze-cinder block wall.jpg|thumb|An interior wall of painted CMUs]]

A '''concrete masonry unit''' ('''CMU''') is a standard size rectangular block used in [[building construction]].

Those that use cinders ([[fly ash]] or [[bottom ash]]) are called '''cinder blocks''' in the United States, '''breeze blocks''' (''breeze'' is a synonym of ''ash'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=breeze |work=[[The Oxford English Dictionary]] |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50027165/50027165se1 |accessdate=2007-11-30 |edition=2nd |year=1989 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |chapter=breeze, ''n.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524174214/http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50027165/50027165se1 |archivedate=May 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United Kingdom, and '''hollow blocks''' in the Philippines. In New Zealand and Canada they are known as '''concrete blocks''' (a name common in the United States also). In New Zealand, they are also called '''construction blocks'''. In Australia they are also called '''Besser blocks''' and '''Besser bricks''', because the [[Jesse Besser|Besser Company]] was a major supplier of machines that made concrete blocks. '''Clinker blocks''' use [[Clinker (waste)|clinker]] as aggregate. In non-technical usage, the terms ''cinder block'' and ''breeze block'' are often generalized to cover all of these varieties.

==Composition==
Concrete blocks are made from [[Casting|cast]] [[concrete]] (e.g. [[Portland cement]] and [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]], usually sand and fine [[gravel]], for high-density blocks). Lower density blocks may use [[industrial waste]]s, such as [[fly ash]] or [[bottom ash]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228234735/http://www.independent.co.uk:80/news/world/middle-east/green-cake-new-invention-concrete-gaza-strip-war-hamas-israeli-blockade-rebuildng-a7517721.html|title=A new invention by two female engineers could be the solution to Gaza's rebuilding problems - The Independent|author=|date=28 February 2018|website=archive.org|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417085423/http://www.middleeasteye.net/in-depth/features/green-cake-cheaper-alternative-help-reconstruction-besieged-gaza-681019806|title=Rebuilding Gaza: 'Green Cake' could be the phoenix rising from Gaza's ashes - Middle East Eye|author=|date=17 April 2017|website=archive.org|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concrete-machinery.com/ |title=Block Making Machine aggregate example|last=|first= |publisher=Web Editor|work (or website)=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lightweight blocks can also be produced using [[autoclaved aerated concrete]].

==Sizes and structure==
The use of blockwork allows structures to be built in the traditional [[masonry]] style with layers (or courses) of staggered blocks. Concrete blocks may be produced with hollow centers (cores) to reduce [[weight]] or improve [[building insulation|insulation]].  Blocks come in modular sizes, with the most popular typically referred to (by their thickness) as "4-inch", "6-inch", "8-inch", and "12-inch". In the US, CMU blocks are [[nominal size|nominally]] {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|8|in|mm|abbr=on}} long.  Their actual dimensions are their nominal dimensions, minus ⅜ in any direction (to allow for mortar joints regardless of their orientation as laid).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archtoolbox.com/materials-systems/masonry/concblocksizes.html The Architect's Toolbox]&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland and the UK, blocks are usually {{convert|440|x|215|x|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} excluding mortar joints. In Australia, New Zealand and Canada, blocks are usually {{convert|390|x|190|x|190|mm|in|abbr=on}} excluding mortar joints.

Block cores are typically tapered so that their top surface (as laid) has a greater surface on which to spread a mortar bed and for easier handling. Most CMU's have two cores, but three- and four-core units are also produced. A core also allows for the insertion of [[rebar|steel reinforcement]] to span courses in order to increase [[tensile strength]].  This is accomplished by [[grout]]ing the voids of blocks containing rebar with concrete. Thus reinforced, CMU walls are better able to resist lateral forces such as [[wind load]] and seismic forces.{{sfn|Beall|1987|pages=61–63}}

A variety of specialized shapes exist to allow special construction features.  U-shaped blocks or knockout blocks with notches to allow the construction of [[bond beam]]s or [[lintel]] assemblies, using horizontal reinforcing grouted into place in the cavity. Blocks with a channel on the end, known as "jamb blocks", allow doors to be secured to wall assemblies. Blocks with grooved ends permit the construction of [[Expansion joint|control joints]], allowing a filler material to be anchored between the un-mortared block ends. Other features, such as radiused corners known as "[[bullnose]]s" may be incorporated. A wide variety of decorative profiles also exist.{{sfn|Beall|1987|pages=66-68}}

Concrete masonry units may be formulated with special aggregates to produce specific colors or textures for finish use. Special textures may be produced by splitting a ribbed or solid two-block unit; such factory-produced units are called "split-rib" or "split-face" blocks.{{sfn|Beall|1987|pages=68-70}} Blocks may be scored by grooves the width of a mortar joint to simulate different block modules. For example, an {{convert|8|by(x)|16|in|adj=on}} block may be scored in the middle to simulate {{convert|8|by(x)|8|in|adj=on}} masonry, with the grooves filled with mortar and struck to match the true joints.&lt;ref name=ching1&gt;{{cite book|last=Ching|first=Francis D.K.|title=A Visual Dictionary of Architecture|year=2012|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], Inc.|isbn=978-0-470-64885-8|edition=2nd|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses===
Concrete block, when built in tandem with [[Reinforced concrete#Use in construction|concrete columns and tie beams]] and [[Rebar#Use in concrete and masonry|reinforced with rebar]], is a very common building material for the [[load-bearing wall]]s of buildings, in what is termed '''concrete block structure''' ('''CBS''') construction. American [[suburban]] [[houses]] typically employ a concrete [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]] and slab with a concrete block wall on the perimeter. Other common uses for concrete block wall is interior fire-rated partition walls, and exterior backup wall for attachment of building envelope systems and façades.

===Structural properties===
Concrete masonry walls may be ungrouted, partially [[grout]]ed, or fully grouted, the latter two enhancing their structural strength. Additionally, steel reinforcement bars ([[rebar]])  can be used both vertically and horizontally inside a CMU wall to maximize its structural performance. The cells in which the rebar is placed must be grouted for the bars to bond to the wall. For this reason, high seismic zones typically only allow fully grouted walls in their building codes. The American design code that guides design engineers in using CMU as a structural system is the ''Masonry Standards Joint Committee's Building Code Requirements &amp; Specification for Masonry Structures'' (TMS 402/ACI 530/ASCE 5). The compressive strength of concrete masonry units and masonry walls varies from approximately {{convert|1000|psi|MPa|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|5000|psi|MPa|0|abbr=on}} based on the type of concrete used to manufacture the unit, stacking orientation, the type of [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] used to build the wall, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cement.org/pdf_files/IS276.pdf|title=Compressive Strength of Masonry |publisher=Portland Cement Organization |format=PDF |accessdate=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/pubs/nrcc26362/nrcc26362.pdf |title=Comprehensive Strength of Hollow Concrete Blockwork |format=PDF |publisher=Government of Canada |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916124303/http://archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/pubs/nrcc26362/nrcc26362.pdf |date=4 June 1986 |archivedate=2017-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chestofbooks.com/reference/Henley-s-20th-Century-Formulas-Recipes-Processes-Vol3/Properties-of-Concrete-Blocks-8212-Strength.html|title=Properties of Concrete Blocks — Strength|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''constitutional court''' is a [[Supreme court|high court]] that deals primarily with [[constitutional law]]. Its main authority is to rule on whether laws that are challenged are in fact [[unconstitutional]], i.e. whether they conflict with constitutionally established rules, rights, and freedoms, among other things.

In 1919 the [[First Austrian Republic]] established the first dedicated constitutional court, the [[Constitutional Court of Austria]], which however existed in name only until 10 October 1920, when [[Constitution of Austria|the country's new constitution]] came into effect, upon which the court gained the power to review the laws of [[States of Austria|Austria's federal states]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vfgh.gv.at/cms/vfgh-site/vfgh/geschichte.html Constitutional Court of Austria - History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826165057/http://www.vfgh.gv.at/cms/vfgh-site/vfgh/geschichte.html |date=2012-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Czechoslovakia]]n [[Constitution of Czechoslovakia (1920)|Constitution of 1920]], which came into effect on 2 February 1920, was the first to provide for a dedicated court for judicial review of parliamentary laws, but the court did not convene until November 1921.

The list in this article is of countries that have a separate constitutional court. Many countries do not have separate constitutional courts, but instead delegate constitutional judicial authority to their general court system, with the final decision-making power resting in the [[supreme court]]. Nonetheless, such courts are sometimes also called "constitutional courts".  For example, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has been called the world's oldest constitutional court&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Liptak |first1=Adam |title=U.S. Court Is Now Guiding Fewer Nations |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/us/18legal.html |accessdate=June 7, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=September 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it was one of the earliest courts in the world to invalidate a law as unconstitutional (''[[Marbury v. Madison]]''), even though it is not a separate constitutional court, hearing as it does cases not touching on the Constitution.

Prior to 1919, the United States, Canada and [[Australia]] had adopted the concept of [[judicial review]] by their courts following shared principles of their similar [[Common law|common law legal systems]], which they, in turn, had inherited from [[British Empire|British]] legal practice. (The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] itself does not have a codified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitution]] to be reviewed by such a court.)
The [[Parthenopean Republic]] constitution of 1799, written by [[Francesco Mario Pagano|Mario Pagano]], envisaged such a body ("[[Ephor|eforato]]"), but lasted only 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro Lenci, ''The battle over "democracy"''.

{{Libertarianism sidebar |Related}}

'''Constitutionalism''' is "a complex of ideas, attitudes, and patterns of behavior elaborating the principle that the authority of government derives from and is limited by [[Constitutional law|a body of fundamental law]]".&lt;ref&gt;Don E. Fehrenbacher, ''Constitutions and Constitutionalism in the Slaveholding South'' (University of Georgia Press, 1989). p. 1. {{ISBN|978-0-8203-1119-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political organizations are constitutional to the extent that they "contain [[institution]]alized mechanisms of power control for the protection of the interests and [[Liberty|liberties]] of the [[citizenry]], including those that may be in the [[Minority group|minority]]".&lt;ref name="Gordon1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gordon |first=Scott |title=Controlling the State: Constitutionalism from Ancient Athens to Today |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1999 |page=4 |isbn=0-674-16987-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As described by political scientist and constitutional scholar [[David Fellman]]:
{{quote|Constitutionalism is descriptive of a complicated concept, deeply embedded in historical experience, which subjects the officials who exercise governmental powers to the limitations of a higher law. Constitutionalism proclaims the desirability of the rule of law as opposed to rule by the arbitrary judgment or mere fiat of public officials&amp;nbsp;...  Throughout the literature dealing with modern public law and the foundations of statecraft the central element of the concept of constitutionalism is that in political society government officials are not free to do anything they please in any manner they choose; they are bound to observe both the limitations on power and the procedures which are set out in the supreme, constitutional law of the community. It may therefore be said that the touchstone of constitutionalism is the concept of limited government under a higher law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-61 Philip P. Wiener, ed., "Dictionary of the History of Ideas: Studies of Selected Pivotal Ideas"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623044421/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-61 |date=2006-06-23 }}, (David Fellman, "Constitutionalism"), vol 1, pp. 485, 491–92 (1973–74) ("Whatever particular form of government a constitution delineates, however, it serves as the keystone of the arch of constitutionalism, except in those countries whose written constitutions are mere sham. Constitutionalism as a theory and in practice stands for the principle that there are—in a properly governed state—limitations upon those who exercise the powers of government, and that these limitations are spelled out in a body of higher law which is enforceable in a variety of ways, political and judicial. This is by no means a modern idea, for the concept of a higher law which spells out the basic norms of a political society is as old as Western civilization. That there are standards of rightness which transcend and control public officials, even current popular majorities, represents a critically significant element of man's endless quest for the good life.")&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Usage ==
Constitutionalism has prescriptive and descriptive uses. Law professor [[Gerhard Casper]] captured this aspect of the term in noting, "Constitutionalism has both descriptive and prescriptive connotations.  Used descriptively, it refers chiefly to the historical struggle for constitutional recognition of the people's right to 'consent' and certain other rights, freedoms, and privileges. Used prescriptively, its meaning incorporates those features of government seen as the essential elements of the... Constitution".&lt;ref name="Leonard Levy p. 473, 473"&gt;Leonard Levy, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the American Constitution'', (Gerhard Casper, "Constitutionalism"), vol 2, p. 473 (1986) {{ISBN|978-0-02-864880-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descriptive===
One example of constitutionalism's descriptive use is law professor Bernard Schwartz's five volume compilation of sources seeking to trace the origins of the U.S. Bill of Rights.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Schwartz, ''The Roots of the Bill of Rights'' (5 vols., Chelsea House Publisher, 1980) {{ISBN|978-0877542070}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with English antecedents going back to [[Magna Carta]] (1215), Schwartz explores the presence and development of ideas of individual freedoms and privileges through colonial charters and legal understandings. Then in carrying the story forward, he identifies revolutionary declarations and [[constitution]]s, documents and judicial decisions of the Confederation period and the formation of the federal Constitution. Finally, he turns to the debates over the federal Constitution's ratification that ultimately provided mounting pressure for a federal bill of rights. While hardly presenting a straight line, the account illustrates the historical struggle to recognize and enshrine constitutional rights and principles in a constitutional order.

===Prescriptive===
In contrast to describing what constitutions are, a prescriptive approach addresses what a constitution should be. As presented by the Canadian philosopher [[Wil Waluchow]], constitutionalism embodies
{{quote|the idea&amp;nbsp;... that government can and should be legally limited in its powers, and that its authority depends on its observing these limitations. This idea brings with it a host of vexing questions of interest not only to legal scholars, but to anyone keen to explore the legal and philosophical foundations of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/constitutionalism ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''], Wil Waluchow "Constitutionalism" (Intro Jan. 2001 (revised Feb. 20, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
One example of this prescriptive approach was the project of the National Municipal League&lt;ref&gt;Frank Mann Stewart, ''A Half Century of Municipal Reform: A History of the National Municipal League'' Ch.2 (Univ. of California Press, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; to develop a model state constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/txp_media/html/cons/features/0301_02/modelcons.pdf|title=''Model State Constitution''|author=|date=|website=utexas.edu|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226004540/http://www.laits.utexas.edu/txp_media/html/cons/features/0301_02/modelcons.pdf|archivedate=26 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authority of government===
Whether reflecting a descriptive or prescriptive focus, treatments of the concept of constitutionalism all deal with the legitimacy of government. One recent assessment of American constitutionalism, for example, notes that the idea of constitutionalism serves to define what it is that "grants and guides the legitimate exercise of government authority".&lt;ref&gt;Christian G. Fritz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpKCvUacmSwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA168 ''American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008). p. 1.] {{ISBN|978-0-521-88188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, historian Gordon S. Wood described this American constitutionalism as "advanced thinking" on the nature of constitutions in which the constitution was conceived to be a "''sett of fundamental rules'' by which even the supreme power of the state shall be governed."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon S. Wood, ''The Creation of the American Republic, 1770–1787'' (Norton &amp; Co. 1969). p. 268. {{ISBN|0-393-31040-X}} (quoting Demophilus, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2066&amp;chapter=155889&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 ''Genuine Principles''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511123036/http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2066&amp;chapter=155889&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |date=2011-05-11 }}. p. 4&gt; (Demophilus [George Bryan?]: ''the Genuine Principles of the Ancient Saxon, Or English [,] Constitution'').&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, American constitutionalism came to rest on the collective sovereignty of the people, the source that legitimized American governments.

===Fundamental law empowering and limiting government===
One of the most salient features of constitutionalism is that it describes and prescribes both the source and the limits of government power. William H. Hamilton has captured this dual aspect by noting that constitutionalism "is the name given to the trust which men repose in the power of words engrossed on parchment to keep a government in order."&lt;ref&gt;Walton H. Hamilton, "Constitutionalism". in Edwin R.A. Seligman, et al. (eds) ''Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (New York: Macmillan 1931). p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constitutionalism and constitutional questions ==
The study of constitutions is not necessarily synonymous with the study of constitutionalism.  Although frequently conflated, there are crucial differences. A discussion of this difference appears in legal historian Christian G. Fritz's ''American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'',&lt;ref&gt;(Cambridge University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; a study of the early history of American constitutionalism. Fritz notes that an analyst could approach the study of historic events focusing on issues that entailed "constitutional questions" and that this differs from a focus that involves "questions of constitutionalism."&lt;ref name="Fritz"&gt;Christian G. Fritz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpKCvUacmSwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA168 ''American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008). p. 6] {{ISBN|978-0-521-88188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Constitutional questions involve the analyst in examining how the constitution was interpreted and applied to distribute power and authority as the new nation struggled with problems of war and peace, taxation and representation. However,

{{quote|These political and constitutional controversies also posed questions of constitutionalism—how to identify the collective sovereign, what powers the sovereign possessed, and how one recognized when that sovereign acted. Unlike constitutional questions, questions of constitutionalism could not be answered by reference to given constitutional text or even judicial opinions. Rather, they were open-ended questions drawing upon competing views Americans developed after Independence about the sovereignty of the people and the ongoing role of the people to monitor the constitutional order that rested on their sovereign authority.&lt;ref name="Fritz" /&gt;}}

A similar distinction was drawn by British constitutional scholar [[A.V. Dicey]] in assessing Britain's unwritten constitution. Dicey noted a difference between the "conventions of the constitution" and the "law of the constitution". The "essential distinction" between the two concepts was that the law of the constitution was made up of "rules enforced or recognised by the Courts", making up "a body of 'laws' in the proper sense of that term." In contrast, the conventions of the constitution consisted "of customs, practices, maxims, or precepts which are not enforced or recognised by the Courts" but "make up a body not of laws, but of constitutional or [[political ethics]]".&lt;ref&gt;Dicey, A. V., [http://www.constitution.org/cmt/avd/law_con.htm ''Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040408171308/http://www.constitution.org/cmt/avd/law_con.htm |date=2004-04-08 }}, 8th ed. (London: Macmillan 1914) (Part III: The Connection between the law of the constitution and the conventions of the constitution; Ch 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constitutional economics ==
Constitutionalism has been the subject of criticism for its previous ignorance of economic issues but this criticism is now taken into account by the development of [[constitutional economics]].

Constitutional economics is a field of [[economics]] and constitutionalism and describes and analyzes the specific interrelationships between constitutional issues and the structure and functioning of the [[economy]]. The term “constitutional economics” was used by American economist [[James M. Buchanan]] as a name for a new academic sub-discipline. Buchanan received in 1986 the [[Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences]] for his "development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1986/buchanan.html|title=James M. Buchanan Jr. - Facts|author=|date=|website=nobelprize.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531002802/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1986/buchanan.html|archivedate=31 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan rejects "any organic conception of the state as superior in wisdom, to the individuals who are its members". This philosophical position is, in fact, the very subject matter of constitutional economics.

A constitutional economics approach allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis, helping to avoid an unidimensional understanding. Buchanan believes that a constitution, intended for use by at least several generations of citizens, must be able to adjust itself for pragmatic economic decisions and to balance interests of the [[state (polity)|state]] and [[society]] against those of individuals and their constitutional rights to [[personal freedom]] and private [[happiness]]. Constitutional economics draws substantial inspiration from the reformist attitude which is characteristic of [[Adam Smith]]'s vision, and that Buchanan’s concept can be considered the modern-day counterpart to what Smith called "the science of [[legislation]]".

Concurrently with the rise of academic research in the field of constitutional economics in the U.S. in the 1980s, the [[Supreme Court of India]] for almost a decade had been encouraging [[public interest litigation]] on behalf of the poor and oppressed by using a very broad interpretation of several articles of the [[Indian Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Cooper, "Poverty and Constitutional Justice", in ''Philosophy of Law: Classic and Contemporary Readings'', edited by Larry May and Jeff Brown. Wiley-Blackwell, UK, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This is a vivid example of a ''de facto'' practical application of the methodology of constitutional economics.

The Russian school of constitutional economics was created in the early 21st century with the idea that constitutional economics allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis in the legislative (especially budgetary) process, thus helping to overcome arbitrariness in the economic and financial decision-making: for instance, when military expenses (and the like) dwarf the budget spending on education and culture. In the [[English language]], the word "constitution" possesses a whole number of meanings, encompassing not only national constitutions as such, but also charters of public organizations, unwritten rules of various clubs, informal groups, etc. The Russian model of constitutional economics, originally intended for transitional and [[developing countries]], focuses entirely on the concept of the state constitution. In 2006, the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] officially recognized constitutional economics as a separate academic sub-discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova. [http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf "The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia" in ''The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032342/http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen. Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Since many countries with transitional political and economic systems continue to treat their constitutions as abstract legal documents disengaged from the economic policy of the state, the practice of constitutional economics becomes there a decisive prerequisite for democratic development of the state and society.

== Examples ==

===Descriptive===
Used descriptively, the concept of constitutionalism can refer chiefly to the historical struggle for constitutional recognition of the people's right to "consent" and certain other rights, freedoms, and privileges.&lt;ref name="Leonard Levy p. 473, 473"/&gt;

====United States====
American constitutionalism has been defined as a complex of ideas, attitudes and patterns elaborating the principle that the authority of government derives from the people, and is limited by a body of fundamental law. These ideas, attitudes and patterns, according to one analyst, derive from "a dynamic political and historical process rather than from a static body of thought laid down in the eighteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;docId=103280003 Stephen M. Griffin, "American Constitutionalism: From Theory to Politics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812002649/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;docId=103280003 |date=2011-08-12 }} (Princeton University Press, 1996). p. 5. {{ISBN|978-0-691-03404-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In U.S. history, constitutionalism, in both its descriptive and prescriptive sense, has traditionally focused on the federal constitution. Indeed, a routine assumption of many scholars has been that understanding "American constitutionalism" necessarily entails the thought that went into the drafting of the federal constitution and the American experience with that constitution since its ratification in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;For the assumptions by historians, political scientists and lawyers that have contributed to a view of constitutionalism essentially connected and confined to the US Constitution, see Christian G. Fritz, [http://works.bepress.com/christian_fritz/1/ "Fallacies of American Constitutionalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511124225/http://works.bepress.com/christian_fritz/1/ |date=2011-05-11 }} ," 35 ''Rutgers Law Journal'' (2004), 1327–69. See also Christian G. Fritz, ''American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008). p. 284 ("Invariably, the state constitutional tradition is deemed less authentic because of its departure from the federal model. This has led to the assumption that one need only study the federal Constitution to discover what American constitutionalism was then and is today.") {{ISBN|978-0-521-88188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a rich tradition of state constitutionalism that offers broader insight into constitutionalism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;G. Alan Tarr, ''Understanding State Constitutions'' (Princeton Univ. Press, 1998) and John J. Dinan, T''he American State Constitutional Tradition'' (Univ. Press of Kansas, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; While state constitutions and the federal constitution operate differently as a function of federalism from the coexistence and interplay of governments at both a national and state level, they all rest on a shared assumption that their legitimacy comes from the sovereign authority of the people or [[popular sovereignty]]. This underlying premise, embraced by the American revolutionaries with the [[Declaration of Independence]] unites American constitutional tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Paul K. Conkin, ''Self-Evident Truths: Being a Discourse on the Origins &amp; Development of the First Principles of American Government – Popular Sovereignty, Natural Rights, and Balance &amp; Separation of Powers'' (Indiana Univ. Press, 1974), p. 52 (describing "the almost unanimous acceptance of popular sovereignty at the level of abstract principle"); Edmund S. Morgan, "The Problem of Popular Sovereignty," in ''Aspects of American Liberty: Philosophical, Historical and Political'' (The American Philosophical Society, 1977), p. 101 (concluding the American Revolution "confirmed and completed the subordination of government to the will of the people"); Willi Paul Adams, ''The First American Constitutions: Republican Ideology and the Making of the State Constitutions in the Revolutionary Era'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1980), p. 137 (asserting that statements of the "principle" of the people's sovereignty "expressed the very heart of the consensus among the victors of 1776").&lt;/ref&gt;

Both experience with state constitutions before and after the federal constitution as well as the emergence and operation of the latter reflect an ongoing struggle over the idea that all governments in America rested on the sovereignty of the people for their legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Christian G. Fritz, ''American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008). p. 284 (Observing that from the Revolutionary era to the period before the Civil War "Americans continued to wrestle with what it meant that their national as well as state governments rested on the sovereignty of the people") {{ISBN|978-0-521-88188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
The United Kingdom is perhaps the best instance of constitutionalism in a country that has an [[uncodified constitution]]. A variety of developments in 17th century England, including "the protracted struggle for power between [[King of the United Kingdom|King]] and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was accompanied by an efflorescence of political ideas in which the concept of countervailing powers was clearly defined,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

====Japan====
The recent move of the Japanese government for revisions of its 1947 constitution under [[Shinzō Abe]]'s administration is criticized as anticonstitutionalist in the sense that the new constitution would impose obligations on citizens rather than protect their human rights.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

====Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth====
From the mid-sixteenth to the late eighteenth century, the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] utilized the ''[[liberum veto]]'', a form of [[unanimity|unanimity voting rule]], in its parliamentary deliberations. The "principle of ''liberum veto'' played an important role in [the] emergence of the unique Polish form of constitutionalism." This constraint on the powers of the monarch were significant in making the "[r]ule of law, religious tolerance and limited constitutional government... the norm in Poland in times when the rest of Europe was being devastated by religious hatred and despotism."&lt;ref name="Rohac2008"&gt;{{cite journal

===Prescriptive===
The prescriptive approach to constitutionalism addresses what a constitution should be.  Two observations might be offered about its prescriptive use.
* There is often confusion in equating the presence of a written constitution with the conclusion that a state or polity is one based upon constitutionalism. As noted by [[David Fellman]], constitutionalism "should not be taken to mean that if a state has a constitution, it is necessarily committed to the idea of constitutionalism. In a very real sense... every state may be said to have a constitution, since every state has institutions which are at the very least expected to be permanent, and every state has established ways of doing things". But even with a "formal written document labelled 'constitution' which includes the provisions customarily found in such a document, it does not follow that it is committed to constitutionalism...."&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-61 Philip P. Wiener, ed., "Dictionary of the History of Ideas: Studies of Selected Pivotal Ideas", (David Fellman, "Constitutionalism")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623044421/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-61 |date=2006-06-23 }}, vol 1, p. 485 (1973–74).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Often the word "constitutionalism" is used in a  rhetorical sense, as a political argument that equates the views of the speaker or writer with a preferred view of the constitution. For instance, University of Maryland Constitutional History Professor Herman Belz's critical assessment of expansive constitutional construction notes that "constitutionalism... ought to be recognized as a distinctive ideology and approach to political life.... Constitutionalism not only establishes the institutional and intellectual framework, but it also supplies much of the rhetorical currency with which political transactions are carried on."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/cmt/belz/lcfl_07.txt Herman Belz, "A Living Constitution or Fundamental Law? American Constitutionalism in Historical Perspective"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202001956/http://www.constitution.org/cmt/belz/lcfl_07.txt |date=2008-12-02 }} (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. 1998) at pp. 148–49 (Belz further argues: "Constitutionalism shapes political life in a variety of ways. Constitutional principles can become matters of commitment and belief possessing intrinsic value that motivate political action.... When citizens and governing officials internalize constitutional values, acting out of fidelity to law rather than expediency, constitutionalism gives direction to political life. Constitutionalism has a configurative effect also in providing the forms, rhetoric, and symbols by which politics is carried on. Political groups and individuals ordinarily try to choose courses of action that are consistent with or required by the Constitution. They do so not because they are in each instance committed to the constitutional principle or value at issue... [but] because they know that the public takes the Constitution seriously, believing that it embodies fundamental values and formal procedures that are the touchstone of political legitimacy. In American politics the Constitution is a justifying concept, and groups that invoke constitutional arguments do so, from their own perspective perhaps and in an immediate sense, instrumentally. Considered from an external and long-range view in relation to the polity as a whole, however, reliance on constitutional principles and rules is normative and noninstrumental. In this way constitutionalism shapes political events") {{ISBN|978-0-8476-8643-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Georgetown University Law Center Professor [[Louis Michael Seidman]] noted as well the confluence of political rhetoric with arguments supposedly rooted in constitutionalism. In assessing the "meaning that critical scholars attributed to constitutional law in the late twentieth century," Professor Seidman notes a "new order... characterized most prominently by extremely aggressive use of legal argument and rhetoric" and as a result "powerful legal actors are willing to advance arguments previously thought out-of-bounds.  They have, in short, used legal reasoning to do exactly what crits claim legal reasoning always does—put the lipstick of disinterested constitutionalism on the pig of raw politics."&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.fordham.edu/publications/articles/500flspub9546.pdf Louis Michael Seidman, "Critical Constitutionalism Now"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910120855/http://law.fordham.edu/publications/articles/500flspub9546.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}, 75 Fordham Law Review pp. 575, 586 (Nov. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{main|Constitutionalism in the United States}}
Starting with the proposition that "'Constitutionalism' refers to the position or practice that [[government]] be limited by a [[constitution]], usually written," analysts take a variety of positions on what the constitution means. For instance, they describe the document as a document that may specify its relation to statutes, treaties, executive and judicial actions, and the constitutions or laws of regional jurisdictions. This prescriptive use of Constitutionalism is also concerned with the [[Constitution#Principles of constitutional design|principles of constitutional design]], which includes the principle that the field of public action be partitioned between [[Delegation|delegated powers]] to the [[government]] and the [[rights]] of individuals, each of which is a restriction of the other, and that no powers be delegated that are beyond the competence of government.&lt;ref&gt;James Madison, in his remarks introducing the Bill of Rights, 8 June 1789, ''Annals'' 1:424–50. [http://www.constitution.org/ac/001/r01-1/bill_of_rights_hr1789.htm Link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504011004/http://www.constitution.org/ac/001/r01-1/bill_of_rights_hr1789.htm |date=2009-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth====
The [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]], which historian [[Norman Davies]] calls "the first constitution of its kind in Europe",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&amp;pg=PA699 |first=Norman |last=Davies |title=Europe: A History |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=699 |isbn=0-19-820171-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; was in effect for only a year. It was designed to redress longstanding political defects of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and its traditional system of "Golden Liberty". The Constitution introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility (''szlachta'') and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

====United Kingdom====
{{see also|Constitution of the United Kingdom}}
[[Constitutionalist (UK)|Constitutionalist]] was also a label used by some independent candidates in [[UK general election]]s in the early 1920s. Most of the candidates were former [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] members, and many of them joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] soon after being elected. The best known Constitutionalist candidate was [[Winston Churchill]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1924|1924 UK general election]].&lt;ref&gt;British parliamentary election results 1918–1949, Craig, F.W.S.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dominican Republic====
After the democratically elected government of president [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]] in the Dominican Republic was deposed, the Constitutionalist movement was born in the country. As opposed to said movement, the Anticonstitutionalist movement was also born. Bosch had to depart to [[Puerto Rico]] after he was deposed. His first leader was Colonel Rafael Tomás Fernández Domínguez, and he wanted Bosch to come back to power once again. Colonel Fernández Domínguez was exiled to Puerto Rico where Bosch was. The Constitutionalists had a new leader: [[Francisco Caamaño|Colonel Francisco Alberto Caamaño Deñó]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

== Criticisms ==
Legal scholar [[Jeremy Waldron]] contends that constitutionalism is often undemocratic:
{{quote|Constitutions are not just about retraining and limiting power; they are about the empowerment of ordinary people in a democracy and allowing them to control the sources of law and harness the apparatus of government to their aspirations. That is the democratic view of constitutions, but it is not the constitutionalist view.... Of course, it is always possible to present an alternative to constitutionalism as an alternative form of constitutionalism: scholars talk of "popular constitutionalism" or "democratic constitutionalism."... But I think it is worth setting out a stark version of the antipathy between constitutionalism and democratic or popular self-government, if only because that will help us to measure more clearly the extent to which a new and mature theory of constitutional law takes proper account of the constitutional burden of ensuring that the people are not disenfranchised by the very document that is supposed to give them their power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Contemporary Debates in Political Philosophy|year=2009|editor=Christiano, Thomas |editor2=Christman, John|page=279|chapter=Constitutionalism – A Skeptical View}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Constitutionalism has also been the subject of criticism by [[Murray Rothbard]], who attacked constitutionalism as incapable of restraining governments and does not protect the rights of citizens from their governments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[i]t is true that, in the [[United States]], at least, we have a constitution that imposes strict limits on some powers of government. But, as we have discovered in the past century, no constitution can interpret or enforce itself; it must be interpreted by ''men''. And if the ultimate power to interpret a constitution is given to the government's own Supreme Court, then the inevitable tendency is for the Court to continue to place its imprimatur on ever-broader powers for its own government. Furthermore, the highly touted "checks and balances" and "separation of powers" in the American government are flimsy indeed, since in the final analysis all of these divisions are part of the same government and are governed by the same set of rulers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/rothbard/newlibertywhole.asp Murray N. Rothbard, ''For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto''] (1978), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Islamic constitutionalism ==
The scope and limits of constitutionalism in Muslim countries have attracted growing interest in recent years. Authors such as Ann E. Mayer define Islamic constitutionalism as "constitutionalism that is in some form based on Islamic principles, as opposed to constitutionalism that has developed in countries that happen to be Muslim but that has not been informed by distinctively Islamic principles".&lt;ref&gt;Ann E. Mayer, Conundrums in Constitutionalism: Islamic Monarchies in an Era of Transition, 1 UCLA J. Islamic &amp; Near E.L. 183 (Spring / Summer, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the concrete meaning of the notion remains contested among Muslim as well as Western scholars. Influential thinkers like [[Mohammad Hashim Kamali]]&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Hashim Kamali, Constitutionalism in Islamic Countries: A Contemporary Perspective of Islamic Law, in: Rainer Grote and Tilmann Röder (eds.), Constitutionalism in Islamic Countries: Between Upheaval and Continuity, Oxford University Press, Oxford/New York 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Khaled Abou El Fadl]],&lt;ref&gt;Khaled Abou El Fadl, Shariah and Constitutionalism in: Rainer Grote and Tilmann Röder (eds.), Constitutionalism in Islamic Countries: Between Upheaval and Continuity, Oxford University Press, Oxford/New York 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; but also younger ones like [[Asifa Quraishi]]&lt;ref&gt;Asifa Quraishi, The Separation of Powers in the Tradition of Muslim Governments, in: Rainer Grote and Tilmann Röder (eds.), Constitutionalism in Islamic Countries: Between Upheaval and Continuity, Oxford University Press, Oxford/New York 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nadirsyah Hosen]]&lt;ref&gt;Nadirsyah Hosen, "In search of Islamic Constitutionalism", ''American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences'', Volume 21, No. 2, 2004, 23 foll.&lt;/ref&gt; combine classic Islamic law with modern constitutionalism. The constitutional changes initiated by the Arab spring movement have already brought into reality many new hybrid models of Islamic constitutionalism.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. the monitoring project "Constitutional Reform in Arab Countries", http://www.mpil.de/red/crac{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Egyptian copyright law'''&lt;ref&gt;Yasser OMAR AMINE, "Chronique d'Egypte", ''Revue Internationale du Droit d'Auteur'' (''RIDA''), janvier 2010, n° 223&lt;/ref&gt; has evolved over time. The currently applicable legislation in [[Egypt]] with regard to [[copyright]] is Book Three of the ''[[:File:Egyptian Intellectual Property Law 82 of 2002 (English).pdf|Law on the Protection of Intellectual Property Rights 82 of 2002]]'', which entered into force on 3 June 2002, the day following its publication in the ''Official Gazette''. The implementing decree is ''[[:File:Egyptian Prime Ministerial Decision 497 of 2005.pdf|Prime Ministerial Decree 497 of 2005]]'' (effective by Issue No. 12, ''Official Gazette'', 29 March 2005).

==Legislative texts==
Prior to 1954, there was no legislation in Egypt protecting artistic and [[literary property]].&lt;ref name="Yasser OMAR AMINE 2015"&gt;Yasser OMAR AMINE, ''The Forgotten Memory of the History of the Egyptian Copyright Law : the jurist M. Linant de Bellefonds, M. Pupikofer and E. Piola Caselli'' (La mémoire oubliée de l'histoire du droit d'auteur égyptien : Les juristes M. Linant de Bellefonds, M. Pupikofer et E. Piola Caselli), Publisher Dar El Nahda El Arabia, Cairo, 2014-2015, 602 p. (in Arabic and part in French)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the absence of any such legislation, indigenous and [[The Mixed Courts of Egypt|mixed courts]] invoked principles of [[natural law]] and [[justice]] to protect [[intellectual property]] rights.&lt;ref name="Yasser OMAR AMINE 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yasser OMAR AMINE, "Chronique d'Egypte", ''RIDA'', janv. 2010, n° 223.&lt;/ref&gt; However, indigenous and mixed courts had two different approaches to sanctioning violations. Indigenous courts refused to apply [[criminal law]] provisions, on the ground that no criminal responsibility could be determined in the absence of a specific legislative text dealing with artistic and literary property. On the other hand, mixed courts did not wait for implementing regulations to be enacted. In a hearing on 17 February 1941, the Criminal Chamber of Cassation, Mixed Court of Appeal, ruled that performance of a song or musical composition, without the authorization of the author or composer, was considered as an offence punishable under Article 351 of the Penal Law.&lt;ref name="Yasser OMAR AMINE 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WIPO/ACE/2/6"&gt;{{cite conference | author = Dr. Hassan El Badrawi | date = 2004-06-04 | title = Role of the Judiciary in the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights | conference = Advisory Committee on Enforcement: Second Session | volume = WIPO/ACE/2/6 | publisher = [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] | location = [[Geneva]] | url = http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/enforcement/en/wipo_ace_2/wipo_ace_2_6.pdf | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | accessdate = 2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law 354 of 1954===
{{Wikisourcelang|ar|قانون 354 لسنة 1954 - مصر|Law 354 of 1954}}
Literary and artistic protection were dealt with for the first time by Egyptian law in 1954, with the promulgation of Law No. 354 of 1954 on the Protection of Copyright.&lt;ref name="WIPO/ACE/2/6"/&gt; Article 20 of the law provided for a [[List of countries' copyright length|term of protection]] of 50 years after the author's death, although this was reduced to [[List of countries' copyright length based on publication and creation dates|15 years from publication]] in the case of "works of photography and audiovisual works that are not of [[Creative work|creative character]] and merely consist of a mechanical reproduction of scenes." [[Official text copyright|Official documents]] were explicitly excluded from copyright protection (Art. 4).

===Law 82 of 2002===
{{Wikisource|Egyptian Copyright Law|Law 82 of 2002}}
The 1954 law was repealed in its entirety when the new Intellectual Property Law 82 of 2002 entered into force on 3 June 2002. The new law retains many provisions contained in the previous law, notably the 50-year ''p.m.a.'' term of copyright protection (Art. 160). However, it also introduces several new concepts, among them the concept of national folklore (Art. 138 &amp; 142). The new law also deals for the first time ever with the protection of [[Related rights|neighbouring rights]] (Art. 153 and following).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author = Dr. Hassan El Badrawi | date = 2004-12-01 | script-title=ar:القانون المصري لحماية حقوق الملكية الفكرية: سماته الرئيسية ومدى توافقه والمعايير الدولية |trans-title=The Egyptian Intellectual Property Law: Main Features and Compatibility with International Standards | conference = WIPO National Training Workshop on Intellectual Property for Diplomats | volume = WIPO/IP/DIPL/CAI/04/2 | publisher = [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] | location = [[Cairo]] | url = http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/arab/ar/wipo_ip_dipl_cai_04/wipo_ip_dipl_cai_04_2.pdf | language = Arabic | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | accessdate = 2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the new law is not without its critics. The [[International Intellectual Property Alliance]] (IIPA) has repeatedly highlighted in its reports a number of shortcomings in the law, stating in its ''Special 301 Report'' published in 2009 that "the Copyright Law and the Implementing Decree, while suitable to enforce against copyright piracy in general, left unresolved some [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|TRIPS]] deficiencies, other ambiguities in protection, and important gaps for protection recommended by IIPA in order to modernize protection." Among the controversial provisions of the law is Article 148, which states that all foreign-language literary works fall into the [[public domain]] if they are not translated into Arabic within three years of publication.&lt;ref&gt;Yasser OMAR AMINE, « Abrogeons l’article 148 du Code égyptien de la propriété intellectuelle (droit de traduction et droit d’auteur en Égypte) », ''Communication – commerce électronique'', nov. 2011, n° 11, alerte 88, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yasser OMAR AMINE, « Le droit international privé du droit d’auteur en Égypte : à la croisée des chemins », ''Revue Critique de Droit International Privé'', janvier-mars 2013/1, pp. 75-100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2009 Special 301"&gt;{{cite web |title=2009 Special 301 Report: Egypt |url=http://www.iipa.com/rbc/2009/2009SPEC301EGYPT.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |date=2009-02-17 |publisher=[[International Intellectual Property Alliance]] |accessdate=16 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposal to copyright antiquities===
In late 2007, reports surfaced in the media that Egypt intended to pass a law requiring the payment of [[royalties]] whenever copies were made of its [[antiquities]] and monuments. [[Zahi Hawass]], the head of the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]], told [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] news agency that the law would not affect buildings such as the [[Luxor Las Vegas]] hotel because it was not an exact copy of a pyramid and its interior was completely different.&lt;ref&gt;Yasser OMAR AMINE, « Intellectual Property... and the protection of pharaonic monuments  », Review of ''Al-Mejalla'', ed. The General Egyptian Book Organization, January 2014, n° 20, p. 7-12 (in Arabic).&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC News]] stated that "MPs are expected to pass" the law, although it is unclear whether the proposal ever made it through [[Parliament of Egypt|Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Egypt 'to copyright antiquities' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7160057.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2007-12-25 |accessdate=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International agreements==
Egypt is a signatory to various [[international copyright agreements]]. The [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] entered into force in Egypt on 7 June 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Berne Convention: Egypt |url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/Remarks.jsp?cnty_id=946C |publisher=[[World Intellectual Property Organization]] |accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of Their Phonograms|Phonograms Convention]] on 23 April 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Phonograms Convention: Egypt |url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/Remarks.jsp?cnty_id=1172C |publisher=[[World Intellectual Property Organization]] |accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt became a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] on 30 June 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Egypt and the WTO |url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/egypt_e.htm |publisher=[[World Trade Organization]] |accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Piracy==
As early as 1985, Egypt has been targeted by the [[International Intellectual Property Alliance|IIPA]]. Based on the results of the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative#The Special 301 Report|Special 301 Report]] (which "examines in detail the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property rights" in many countries around the world), the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative|United States Trade Representative]] (USTR) placed Egypt on the ''Priority Watch List'' in 1992. The USTR lowered Egypt to the ''[[:File:2009 Special 301 Report (World Map).png|Watch List]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Appendix E: Historical Summary of Selected Countries' Placement for Copyright-Related Matters on the Special 301 Lists |url=http://www.iipa.com/rbc/2009/2009SPEC301HISTORICALSUMMARY.pdf |date=2009-02-17 |work=2009 Special 301 Report on Copyright Protection and Enforcement |publisher=[[International Intellectual Property Alliance]] |pages=15–16 |accessdate=16 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of [[Copyright infringement|piracy]] is pervasive in Egypt. The IIPA stated in a 2009 report that Egypt is "a nightmare market for right holders, stunted by piracy, difficult bureaucracy, and almost unparalleled market access hurdles."&lt;ref name="2009 Special 301"/&gt; Trade losses due to copyright piracy amounted to nearly $119 million in 2007, with a piracy level of 32% for books and 15% for records and music.&lt;ref name="2009 Special 301"/&gt;

{{Judicial remedies}}
A '''declaratory judgment''', also called a declaration, is the [[Legal judgment|legal determination]] of a [[court]] that resolves legal uncertainty for the [[litigant]]s. It is a form of [[legally binding]] preventive [[adjudication]]&lt;ref name=standard&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=1483859 |title=Preventive Adjudication |journal=University of Chicago Law Review |volume=77 |first=Samuel |last=Bray |year=2010 |page=1275}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which a party involved in an actual or possible legal matter can ask a court to conclusively rule on and affirm the rights, duties, or obligations of one or more parties in a [[civil case|civil]] [[:wikt:dispute|dispute]] (subject to any [[legal appeal|appeal]]).&lt;ref&gt;28 U.S.C.S. § 2201 (“Any such declaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and shall be reviewable as such.”)&lt;/ref&gt; The declaratory judgment is generally considered a [[statutory]] remedy and not an [[equitable remedy]] in the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;''Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp.'', 485 U.S. 271, 284 (1988) (“Actions for declaratory judgments  are neither legal nor equitable . . . .”).&lt;/ref&gt; and is thus not subject to equitable requirements, though there are analogies that can be found in the remedies granted by [[equity (law)|courts of equity]].&lt;ref name="Samuels v Mackell"&gt;''Samuels v. Mackell'', 401 U.S. 66, 70 (1971) (“Although the declaratory judgment sought by the plaintiffs was a statutory remedy rather than a traditional form of equitable relief, the Court made clear that a suit for declaratory judgment was nevertheless ‘essentially an equitable cause of action,’ and was ‘analogous to the equity jurisdiction in suits quia timet or for a decree quieting title.’”) (citations omitted)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Green v Mansour"&gt;''Green v. Mansour'', 474 U.S. 64, 72 (1985) (“The propriety of issuing a declaratory judgment may depend upon equitable considerations”).&lt;/ref&gt; A declaratory judgment does not by itself order any action by a party, or imply [[damages]] or an [[injunction]], although it may be accompanied by one or more other remedies.

A declaratory judgment is generally distinguished from an [[advisory opinion]] because the latter does not resolve an actual [[case or controversy]]. Declaratory judgments can provide [[legal certainty]] to each party in a matter when this could resolve or assist in a disagreement. Often an early resolution of [[legal rights]] will resolve some or all of the other issues in a matter.

A declaratory judgment is typically requested when a party is threatened with a [[lawsuit]] but the lawsuit has not yet been filed; or when a party or parties believe that their rights under law and/or [[contract]] might conflict; or as part of a [[counterclaim]] to prevent further lawsuits from the same plaintiff (for example, when only a contract claim is filed, but a copyright claim might also be applicable).  In some instances, a declaratory judgment is filed because the statute of limitations against a potential defendant may pass before the plaintiff incurs damage (for example, a malpractice statute applicable to a certified public accountant may be shorter than the time period the IRS has to assess a taxpayer for additional tax due to bad advice given by the C.P.A.).

Declaratory judgments are authorized by statute in most common-law jurisdictions. In the [[United States]], the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] and most states enacted statutes in the 1920s and 1930s authorizing their courts to issue declaratory judgments.&lt;ref&gt;See Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C.S. § 2201&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cease and desist==
The filing of a declaratory judgment [[lawsuit]] can follow the sending by one party of a [[cease-and-desist]] letter to another party.&lt;ref&gt;http://home.comcast.net/~jlw28129/05Harvey-Appel.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  A party contemplating sending such a letter risks that the recipient, or a party related to the recipient (such as a customer or supplier), may file for a declaratory judgment in their own [[jurisdiction]], or sue for minor damages in the law of unjustified threats.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.houstoninternetlaw.com/Cease%20and%20Desist.html; http://ocpatentlawyer.com/cease-and-desist-letters/. But see http://www.law.com/jsp/lawtechnologynews/PubArticleLTN.jsp?id=1202492338347&amp;slreturn=1&lt;/ref&gt;  This may require the sender to appear in a distant court, at their own expense.  So sending a cease-and-desist letter presents a dilemma to the sender, as it would be desirable to be able to address the issues at hand in a candid manner without the need for litigation. Upon receiving a cease-and-desist letter, the recipient may seek a tactical advantage by instituting declaratory-judgment litigation in a more favorable jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="houstoninternetlaw1"&gt;See http://www.houstoninternetlaw.com/Cease%20and%20Desist.html; http://ocpatentlawyer.com/cease-and-desist-letters/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the parties agree in advance of discussions that no declaratory-judgment lawsuit will be filed while the negotiations are continuing.  Sometimes a lawsuit is filed, but not served, before sending such a notice, to preserve a jurisdiction advantage without engaging the judicial process fully.  Some parties send cease-and-desist letters that make "an oblique suggestion of possible infringement" to lower the risk of the recipient filing a declaratory-judgment lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.findlaw.com/2003/Oct/31/133125.html |title=Patent Law: "Reasonable Apprehension" After Receipt of Cease-and-Desist Letter Grounds for Declaratory Judgment Action |publisher=Library.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declaratory judgment actions in patent litigation==
Declaratory judgments are common in [[patent]] litigation, as well as in other areas of [[intellectual property]] litigation, because declaratory judgments allow an alleged infringer to "clear the air" about a product or service that may be a business's focal point.  For example, in a typical [[patent infringement|patent-infringement]] claim, when a patent owner becomes aware of an infringer, the owner can simply wait until he pleases to bring an infringement suit.&lt;ref&gt;But see 35 U.S.C. 286 (imposing a six-year time limitation on damages).&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, the [[monetary damages]] continuously accrue – with no effort expended by the patent owner, apart from marking the patent number on products the patent owner sold or licensed.&lt;ref&gt;See http://library.findlaw.com/2002/Dec/19/132442.html&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the alleged infringer could do nothing to rectify the situation if no declaratory judgment existed.  The alleged infringer would be forced to continue to operate his business with the cloud of a lawsuit over his head.  The declaratory-judgment procedure allows the alleged infringer to proactively bring suit to resolve the situation and eliminate the cloud of uncertainty looming overhead.

Common claims for declaratory judgment in patent cases are non-infringement, patent invalidity, and unenforceability. To bring a claim for declaratory judgment in a situation where a patent dispute may exist or develop, the claimant must establish that an [[actual controversy]] exists.&lt;ref&gt;See [[MedImmune,_Inc._v._Genentech,_Inc.]], 549 U.S. 118, 126–27 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  If there is a substantial controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality, the court will generally proceed with the declaratory-judgment action.&lt;ref&gt;See [[MedImmune,_Inc._v._Genentech,_Inc.]], 549 U.S. 118, 127 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The court may even hear the action if the patentee has not filed a cease and desist letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstoninternetlaw.com/Cease%20and%20Desist.html |title=Cease and Desist Letter |publisher=Houstoninternetlaw.com |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The standard for an actual controversy was most recently addressed by the Supreme Court in ''MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.'', 549 U.S. 118 (2007).  But even if an actual controversy exists, the declaratory-judgment statute is permissive—a [[district court]], in its discretion, may decline to hear a declaratory-judgment action.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Grand T. W. R. Co. v. Consolidated Rail Corp.'', 746 F.2d 323, 325 (6th Cir. 1984) (“Title 28 of the United States Code § 2201 provides that in ‘a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction’ a federal court ‘may’ give a declaratory judgment, a power permissive, not mandatory. Although it is well settled that the granting of a declaratory judgment rests in the "sound discretion" of the court”).&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually the claimant is actually making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing or is prepared to actually make, use or sell, offer to sell or import an allegedly infringing device or method, and usually the patent owner has claimed that such activities by claimant will result in patent infringement.&lt;ref&gt;35 U.S.C. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;  An express threat of litigation is not needed, nor is it a guarantee that jurisdiction will be granted.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.houstoninternetlaw.com/Cease%20and%20Desist.html; ##Grand T. W. R. Co. v. Consolidated Rail Corp.'', 746 F.2d 323, 325 (6th Cir. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;  Some factors courts have considered in this analysis are whether a patent owner has asserted its rights against an alleged infringer in a royalty dispute, whether the owner has sued a customer of an alleged infringer, or whether an owner has made statements regarding its patents in trade magazines.

===Patent pitfalls and strategy===
{{Section howto|date=May 2017}}
The patent owner must be very careful when communicating with possible infringers.  If a patent owner does suggest that there is patent coverage of what an alleged infringer is doing or planning to do, the alleged infringer may bring suit.&lt;ref name="houstoninternetlaw1"/&gt; The alleged infringer, as the plaintiff in the suit, can choose the venue subject to constitutional restrictions and the state long-arm statute of the forum in question. The suit can be brought in any forum if the local federal district court can properly obtain personal jurisdiction over the alleged infringer. The patent owner being sued for a declaratory judgment created a situation where he has lost the "home-field advantage". Travel costs to a distant courthouse can be substantial, and a party  litigating in a distant forum may have to hire a local attorney, if required by the local rules, in addition to the regular patent litigation counsel.

Also, distant [[juries]] sometimes prefer the "home-town" guy over the foreigner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.valoremlaw.com/documents/ChanenPretrialPractice.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Defendants in infringement cases should also not forget the utility of a declaratory judgment as a counterclaim. If a defendant brings a declaratory-judgment [[counterclaim]], the plaintiff may not be able to so easily drop the suit if the outcome begins to look dismal because plaintiff now has to defend the counterclaim.

Patent owners should also be aware that a counterclaim of infringement is a [[compulsory counterclaim]] to a claim for declaratory judgment of non-infringement.&lt;ref&gt;''Vivid Techs., Inc. v. Am. Sci. &amp; Eng'g Inc.'', 200 F.3d 795, 802 (Fed. Cir. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; If a patent owner fails to assert an infringement counterclaim in a declaratory-judgment non-infringement suit, the patent infringement claim will be deemed waived.

{{Democracy}}
{{Forms of government}}

'''Direct democracy''' or '''pure democracy''' is a form of [[democracy]] in which people decide on policy [[initiatives]] directly. This differs from the majority of most currently established democracies, which are [[representative democracy|representative democracies]].

==Overview==
In a [[representative democracy]], people vote for representatives who then enact policy initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Budge |author-first=Ian |chapter=Direct democracy |editor=Clarke, Paul A.B. |editor2=Foweraker, Joe |title=Encyclopedia of Political Thought |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2001 |isbn=9780415193962 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=srzDCqnZkfUC&amp;pg=PA224}}&lt;/ref&gt; In direct democracy, people decide on policies without any intermediary. Depending on the particular system in use, direct democracy might entail passing executive decisions, the use of [[sortition]], making [[law]]s, directly electing or dismissing officials, and conducting [[trial]]s. Two leading forms of direct democracy are [[participatory democracy]] and [[deliberative democracy]].

[[Semi-direct democracies]] in which representatives administer day-to-day governance, but the citizens remain the sovereign, allow for three forms of popular action: [[referendum]] (plebiscite), [[initiative]], and [[recall election|recall]]. The first two forms—referendums and initiatives—are examples of direct legislation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Democratic Innovations: Designing Institutions for Citizen Participation (Theories of Institutional Design)|last = Smith|first = Graham|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = 112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 'compulsory referendum' subjects the legislation drafted by political elites to a binding popular vote. This is the most common form of direct legislation. A 'popular referendum' empowers citizens to make a petition that calls existing legislation to a vote by the citizens. Institutions specify the timeframe for a valid petition and the number of signatures required, and may require signatures from diverse communities to protect minority interests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This form of direct democracy effectively grants the voting public a [[veto]] on laws adopted by the elected legislature, as is done in [[Switzerland]].{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011a}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011b}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011c}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011d}}

A 'citizen-initiated referendum' (also called an [[initiative]]) empowers members of the general public to propose, by petition, specific statutory measures or constitutional reforms to the government and, as with referendums, the vote may be binding or simply advisory. Initiatives may be direct or indirect: With the direct initiative, a successful proposition is placed directly on the ballot to be subject to vote (as exemplified by California's system).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With an indirect initiative, a successful proposition is first presented to the legislature for their consideration; however, if no acceptable action is taken after a designated period of time, the proposition moves to direct popular vote. Such a form of indirect initiative is utilized by Switzerland for constitutional amendments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A [[deliberative referendum]] is a referendum that increases public deliberation through purposeful institutional design.

Power of recall gives the public the power to remove elected officials from office before the end of their term.&lt;ref name="FishkinCh2&amp;3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fishkin|2011|loc=Chapters 2 &amp; 3. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|History of democracy}}
The earliest known direct democracy is said to be the [[Athenian democracy]] in the 5th century BC, although it was not an inclusive democracy: women, foreigners, and [[slavery|slaves]] were excluded from it. The main bodies in the Athenian democracy were the [[Popular assembly|assembly]], composed of male citizens; the [[boule (ancient Greece)|boulê]], composed of 500 citizens; and the law courts, composed of a massive number of jurors chosen by lot, with no judges. There were only about 30,000 male citizens, but several thousand of them were politically active in each year, and many of them quite regularly for years on end. The Athenian democracy was ''direct'' not only in the sense that decisions were made by the assembled people, but also in the sense that the people through the assembly, boulê, and law courts controlled the entire political process, and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business.&lt;ref name="Raaflaub5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Raaflaub|Ober|Wallace|2007|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern democracies, being representative, not direct, do not resemble the Athenian system.

Also relevant to the history of direct democracy is the history of [[Ancient Rome]], specifically the [[Roman Republic]], beginning around 509&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=cary67&gt;{{Harvnb|Cary|Scullard|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rome displayed many aspects of democracy, both direct and indirect, from the era of [[Roman Kingdom|Roman monarchy]] all the way to the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]]. Indeed, the [[Roman senate|Senate]], formed in the first days of the city, lasted through the Kingdom, Republic, and Empire, and even continued after the decline of Western Rome; and its structure and regulations continue to influence legislative bodies worldwide. As to direct democracy, the ancient Roman Republic had a system of citizen lawmaking, or citizen formulation and passage of law, and a citizen veto of legislature-made law. Many historians mark the end of the Republic with the passage of a law named the ''[[Lex Titia]]'', 27 November 43 BC, which eliminated many oversight provisions.&lt;ref name=cary67/&gt;

Modern-era citizen lawmaking began in the towns of [[Switzerland]] in the 13th century. In 1847, the Swiss added the "statute referendum" to their national constitution. They soon discovered that merely having the power to veto Parliament's laws was not enough. In 1891, they added the "constitutional amendment initiative". Swiss politics since 1891 have given the world a valuable experience base with the national-level constitutional amendment initiative.&lt;ref name="Kobach1993"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kobach|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past 120 years, more than 240 initiatives have been put to referendums. The populace has been conservative, approving only about 10% of these initiatives; in addition, they have often opted for a version of the initiative rewritten by government. (See ''[[#Switzerland|Direct democracy in Switzerland]]'' below.){{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011a}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011b}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011c}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011d}}

Some of the issues surrounding the related notion of a direct democracy using the [[Internet]] and other communications technologies are dealt with in [[e-democracy]] and below under the term ''electronic direct democracy''. More concisely, the concept of [[open source governance]] applies principles of the [[free software movement]] to the governance of people, allowing the entire populace to participate in government directly, as much or as little as they please.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Open Source Democracy|last = Rushkoff|first = Douglas|publisher = Project Gutenberg Self-Publishing|year = 2004|isbn = |location = Project Gutenburg|pages = |url = http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10753/pg10753.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Early Athens===
{{Main|Athenian democracy}}
Athenian democracy developed in the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city-state]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]], comprising the city of Athens and the surrounding territory of [[Attica]], around 600 BC. Athens was one of the [[History of democracy#Athens|very first known democracies]]. Other Greek cities set up democracies, and even though most followed an Athenian model, none were as powerful, stable, or well-documented as that of Athens. In the direct democracy of Athens, the citizens did not nominate representatives to vote on legislation and executive bills on their behalf (as in the United States) but instead voted as individuals. The [[public opinion]] of voters was influenced by the [[political satire]] of the [[Ancient Greek comedy|comic poets]] in the [[Ancient Greek theatre|theatres]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J. (1996) ''Comic Hero versus Political Elite'' pp. 307–19 in {{Cite book|editor=Sommerstein, A.H. |editor2=S. Halliwell |editor3=J. Henderson |editor4=B. Zimmerman |title=Tragedy, Comedy and the Polis |year=1993 |publisher=Levante Editori |location=Bari}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solon]] (694 BC), [[Cleisthenes]] (608–607 BCE), and [[Ephialtes]] (562 BC) all contributed to the development of Athenian democracy. Historians differ on which of them was responsible for which institution, and which of them most represented a truly democratic movement. It is most usual to date Athenian democracy from Cleisthenes, since Solon's constitution fell and was replaced by the tyranny of [[Peisistratos|Peisistratus]], whereas Ephialtes revised Cleisthenes' constitution relatively peacefully.
[[Hipparchus (son of Pisistratus)|Hipparchus]], the brother of the tyrant [[Hippias (son of Pisistratus)|Hippias]], was killed by [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton]], who were subsequently honored by the Athenians for their alleged restoration of Athenian freedom.

The greatest and longest-lasting democratic leader was [[Pericles]]; after his death, Athenian democracy was twice briefly interrupted by oligarchic revolution towards the end of the [[Peloponnesian War]]. It was modified somewhat after it was restored under [[Eucleides]]; the most detailed accounts are of this 4th-century modification rather than of the Periclean system. It was suppressed by the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonians]] in 322 BC. The Athenian institutions were later revived, but the extent to which they were a real democracy is debatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Elster|1978|pp=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
[[File:Swiss voting material.jpg|thumb|In [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]], with no need to register, every citizen receives the [[ballot papers]] and information brochure for each vote, and can return it by post. Switzerland has various directly democratic instruments; votes are organised about four times a year.]]
{{Main|Politics of Switzerland|Voting in Switzerland}}
{{Further|Landsgemeinde|Federal popular initiative}}

The pure form of direct democracy exists only in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] and [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]].&lt;ref name=Golay/&gt; The [[Swiss Confederation]] is a semi-direct democracy (representative democracy with strong instruments of direct democracy).&lt;ref name=Golay/&gt; The nature of direct democracy in Switzerland is fundamentally complemented by its federal governmental structures (in [[German language|German]] also called the [[:de:Subsidiaritätsprinzip&lt;!-- please note that the English WP article about Subsidiarity does not (yet) reflect/discuss the political/governmental nature in a satisfiying quality, therefore referring to the German Article here --&gt;|Subsidiaritätsprinzip]]).{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011a}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011b}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011c}}{{sfnp|Hirschbühl|2011d}}

Most western countries have representative systems.&lt;ref name=Golay&gt;Vincent Golay and Mix et Remix, ''Swiss political institutions'', Éditions loisirs et pédagogie, 2008. {{ISBN|978-2-606-01295-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Switzerland]] is a rare example of a country with instruments of direct democracy (at the levels of the municipalities, [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]], and [[Politics of Switzerland|federal state]]). Citizens have more power than in a representative democracy. On any political level citizens can propose changes to the constitution ([[Popular initiative (Switzerland)|popular initiative]]), or ask for an [[optional referendum]] to be held on any law voted by the [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|federal]], [[cantonal]] parliament and/or [[Municipalities of Switzerland|municipal]] legislative body.&lt;ref name=refdum&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ch.ch/en/referendum |title=Referendums |publisher=Swiss Confederation |website=ch.ch – A service of the Confederation, cantons and communes |location=Berne, Switzerland |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list for [[mandatory referendum|mandatory]] or optional referendums on each political level are generally much longer in Switzerland than in any other country; for example any amendment to the constitution must automatically be voted on by the Swiss electorate and cantons, on cantonal/communal levels often any financial decision of a certain substantial amount decreed by legislative and/or executive bodies as well.&lt;ref name=refdum/&gt;

Swiss citizens vote regularly on any kind of issue on every political level, such as financial approvals of a school house or the building of a new street, or the change of the policy regarding sexual work, or on constitutional changes, or on the foreign policy of Switzerland, four times a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/directdemocracy/checks-and-balances_the-swiss-vote-more-than-any-other-country/36286970 |title=The Swiss vote more than any other country|author=Julia Slater |publisher=swissinfo.ch – the international service of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation |date=28 June 2013 |location=Berne, Switzerland |accessdate=2015-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between January 1995 and June 2005, Swiss citizens voted 31 times, on 103 federal questions besides many more cantonal and municipal questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/directdemocracy/explore-600-national-votes_how-direct-democracy-has-grown-over-the-decades/41481992 |title=How direct democracy has grown over the decades |author=Duc-Quang Nguyen |publisher=swissinfo.ch – the international service of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation |date=17 June 2015 |location=Berne, Switzerland |accessdate=2015-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, French citizens participated in only two referendums.&lt;ref name=Golay/&gt;

In [[Switzerland]], simple majorities are sufficient at the municipal and [[cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]] level, but at the federal level [[Double majority|double majorities]] are required on constitutional issues.&lt;ref name="Kobach1993" /&gt;

A double majority requires approval by a majority of individuals voting, and also by a majority of cantons. Thus, in Switzerland a citizen-proposed amendment to the federal constitution (i.e. [[Popular initiative (Switzerland)|popular initiative]]) cannot be passed at the federal level if a majority of the people approve but a majority of the cantons disapprove.&lt;ref name="Kobach1993" /&gt; For referendums or propositions in general terms (like the principle of a general revision of the Constitution), a majority of those voting is sufficient (Swiss Constitution, 2005).

In 1890, when the provisions for Swiss national citizen lawmaking were being debated by civil society and government, the Swiss adopted the idea of double majorities from the [[United States Congress]], in which House votes were to represent the people and Senate votes were to represent the [[U.S. state|states]].&lt;ref name="Kobach1993" /&gt; According to its supporters, this "legitimacy-rich" approach to national citizen lawmaking has been very successful. Kris Kobach claims that Switzerland has had tandem successes both socially and economically which are matched by only a few other nations. Kobach states at the end of his book, "Too often, observers deem Switzerland an oddity among political systems. It is more appropriate to regard it as a pioneer." Finally, the Swiss political system, including its direct democratic devices in a [[multi-level governance]] context, becomes increasingly interesting for scholars of [[European Union]] integration.&lt;ref&gt;Trechsel (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris Commune===

{{Main|Paris Commune}}

In 1871 after the establishment of the Paris Commune, the Parisians established a decentralized direct system of government with appointed organizers to make sense of the largely spontaneous uprising. While it still refused women the right to vote, they were heavily involved in the consensus before votes took place. Everything from the military to when meetings took place was democratized, and such decentralization and aforementioned democratization led many members of the First Internationale to regard the Paris Commune as a stateless society.

Due to the short lifespan of the Commune, only one citywide election was held and the structures necessary to facilitate future organized elections on large scales was largely nonexistent. However, the influence of direct democratization in the Paris Commune is not to be understated.

===United States===
{{Main|History of direct democracy in the United States|Initiatives and referendums in the United States}}

In the [[New England]] region of the United States, [[New England town|towns]] in areas such as [[Vermont]] decide local affairs through the direct democratic process of the [[town meeting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2A35hJAR7u0C&amp;pg=PR7|title=Real Democracy: The New England Town Meeting and How It Works|first=Frank M.|last=Bryan|date=15 March 2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=27 April 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the oldest form of direct democracy in the United States, and predates the founding of the country by at least a century.

Direct democracy was not what the framers of the [[United States Constitution]] envisioned for the nation. They saw a danger in [[tyranny of the majority]]. As a result, they advocated a [[representative democracy]] in the form of a constitutional republic over a direct democracy. For example, [[James Madison]], in [[Federalist No. 10]], advocates a constitutional republic over direct democracy precisely to protect the individual from the will of the majority. He says,

{{quote|Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society. Those who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a like discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests, grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into different classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government.

[...]

[A] pure democracy, by which I mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person, can admit no cure for the mischiefs of faction. A common passion or interest will be felt by a majority, and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party. Hence it is, that democracies have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have, in general, been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm The Federalist No. 10&amp;nbsp;– The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection (continued)&amp;nbsp;– Daily Advertiser&amp;nbsp;– November 22, 1787&amp;nbsp;– James Madison]. Retrieved 2007-09-07.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[John Witherspoon]], one of the signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], said: "Pure democracy cannot subsist long nor be carried far into the departments of state&amp;nbsp;– it is very subject to caprice and the madness of popular rage." [[Alexander Hamilton]] said, "That a pure democracy if it were practicable would be the most perfect government. Experience has proved that no position is more false than this. The ancient democracies in which the people themselves deliberated never possessed one good feature of government. Their very character was tyranny; their figure, deformity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zagarri|2010|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the framers' intentions in the beginning of the republic, ballot measures and their corresponding referendums have been widely used at the state and sub-state level. There is much state and federal [[case law]], from the early 1900s to the 1990s, that protects the people's right to each of these direct democracy governance components (Magleby, 1984, and Zimmerman, 1999). The first [[United States Supreme Court]] ruling in favor of the citizen lawmaking was in ''Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company v. Oregon'', 223 U.S. 118 in 1912 (Zimmerman, December 1999). [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]], in his "Charter of Democracy" speech to the 1912 [[Ohio]] constitutional convention, stated: "I believe in the Initiative and Referendum, which should be used not to destroy representative government, but to correct it whenever it becomes misrepresentative."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watts|2010|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In various states, referendums through which the people rule include:
* ''Referrals'' by the legislature to the people of "proposed constitutional amendments" (constitutionally used in 49 states, excepting only [[Delaware]]&amp;nbsp;– Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute, 2004).
* ''Referrals'' by the legislature to the people of "proposed statute laws" (constitutionally used in all 50 states&amp;nbsp;– Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute, 2004).
* ''Constitutional amendment initiative'' is a constitutionally-defined petition process of "proposed constitutional law", which, if successful, results in its provisions being written directly into the state's constitution. Since constitutional law cannot be altered by state legislatures, this direct democracy component gives the people an automatic superiority and sovereignty, over representative government (Magelby, 1984). It is utilized at the state level in nineteen states: [[Arizona]], [[Arkansas]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Florida]], [[Illinois]], [[Louisiana]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[Nevada]], [[North Dakota]], [[Ohio]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Oregon]] and [[South Dakota]] (Cronin, 1989). Among these states, there are three main types of the constitutional amendment initiative, with different degrees of involvement of the state legislature distinguishing between the types (Zimmerman, December 1999).
* ''Statute law initiative'' is a constitutionally-defined, citizen-initiated petition process of "proposed statute law", which, if successful, results in law being written directly into the state's statutes. The statute initiative is used at the state level in twenty-one states: [[Alaska]], Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, [[Idaho]], [[Maine]], Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, [[Utah]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Wyoming]] (Cronin, 1989). Note that, in Utah, there is no constitutional provision for citizen lawmaking. All of Utah's I&amp;R law is in the state statutes (Zimmerman, December 1999). In most states, there is no special protection for citizen-made statutes; the legislature can begin to amend them immediately.
* ''Statute law referendum'' is a constitutionally-defined, citizen-initiated petition process of the "proposed veto of all or part of a legislature-made law", which, if successful, repeals the standing law. It is used at the state level in twenty-four states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, [[Kentucky]], Maine, [[Maryland]], Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, [[New Mexico]], North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming (Cronin, 1989).
* The ''[[recall election]]'' is a citizen-initiated process which, if successful, removes an elected official from office and replaces him or her. The first recall device in the United States was adopted in [[Los Angeles]] in 1903. Typically, the process involves the collection of citizen petitions for the recall of an elected official; if a sufficient number of valid signatures and collected and verified, a recall election is triggered. In U.S. history, there have been three gubernatorial recall elections in U.S. history (two of which resulted in the recall of the governor) and 38 recall elections for state legislators (55% of which succeeded). 
: Nineteen states and the [[District of Columbia]] have a recall function for state officials. Additional states have recall functions for local jurisdictions. Some states require specific grounds for a recall petition campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/recall-of-state-officials.aspx Recall of State Officials], National Conference of State Legislatures (March 8, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zapatistas ===
[[Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities|Territories held by the Zapatistas]] in [[Mexico]] also employ elements of direct democracy. At a local level, people attend a [[general assembly]] of around 300 families where anyone over the age of 12 can participate in decision-making, these assemblies strive to reach a [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]] but are willing to fall back to a majority vote. Each community has 3 main administrative structures: (1) the ''commissariat'', in charge of day-to day administration; (2) the ''council for land control'', which deals with forestry and disputes with neighboring communities; and (3) the ''agencia'', a community police agency. The communities form a federation with other communities to create an autonomous municipalities, which form further federations with other municipalities to create a region. The Zapatistas are composed of five regions, in total having a population of around 300,000 people.

=== Rojava ===
In Syrian Kurdistan, in the cantons of [[Rojava]], a new model of polity is exercised by the Kurdish freedom movement, that of [[Democratic confederalism]]. This model has been developed by [[Abdullah Öcalan]], the leader of the [[Kurdistan Worker's Party|Kurdistan Workers' Party]], on the basis of the Kurdish revolutionary experience and traditions, and of the theory of [[Libertarian Municipalism|Communalism]] developed by [[Murray Bookchin]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Knapp, A. Flach, E. Ayboga and J. Biehl, ''Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan'', London, Pluto Press, 2016, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; At the opposite of the [[Nation state|Nation-State]] model of sovereignty, Democratic confederalism rests on the principle of radical self-government, where political decisions are taken in popular assemblies at the level of the commune, which will send delegates to the confederate level of the district and the canton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecology or Catastrophe: The Life of Murray Bookchin|last=Biehl|first=Janet|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780199342495|location=Oxford|pages=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bottom-up political structure coexists with the democratic self-administration, as organized in the [[Charter of the Social Contract]] adopted by the cantons of Rojava in 2014. These two structures constitute a situation characterized as one of dual power by [[David Graeber]], though a peculiar one as they are both formed by the same movement.&lt;ref&gt;M. Knapp, A. Flach, E. Ayboga and J. Biehl, ''Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan'', London, Pluto Press, 2016, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to other experiences categorized as ones of direct democracy such as OWS, the Rojava experiment presents only several elements of direct democracy, namely the organization of the self-governing communes in popular assemblies where everybody can participate, the confederation of these communes through imperative and recallable mandates, the rotation of charges (often biannually) and the absence of a centralized power.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;M. Knapp, A. Flach, E. Ayboga and J. Biehl, ''Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan'', London, Pluto Press, 2016, pp. 87-91.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, Öcalan describes the principle of Democratic Confederalism as follows: "In contrast to a centralist and bureaucratic understanding of administration and exercise of power confederalism poses a type of political self-administration where all groups of the society and all cultural identities can express themselves in local meetings, general conventions and councils.".&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Öcalan, ''Democratic Confederalism'', Cologne, 2011, bit.ly/1AUntIO, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, Rojava is organized on a system of "Four Level Councils": the Commune, the Neighborhood, the District, and the People's Council of West Kurdistan. Each level nominates delegates for the next level with [[imperative mandate]]s as well as recallable mandates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As democratic autonomy rests on the equal political engagement of members of the community, the Kurdish women's movement aims at changing the historical exclusion of women from the public sphere as well as at educating women, creating space where they can participate and produce their own decisions.&lt;ref&gt;M. Knapp, A. Flach, E. Ayboga and J. Biehl, ''Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan'', London, Pluto Press, 2016, pp. 43 and 63.&lt;/ref&gt; This commitment to women's liberation is instantiated in the principle of dual leadership and 40 percent quota and in the many political spaces created for women's education as well as their political and economic emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;M. Knapp, A. Flach, E. Ayboga and J. Biehl, Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan, London, Pluto Press, 2016, pp. 64-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Women are therefore fully included in the project of direct democracy. In order to contribute to their political emancipation, Kurdish women created a new science, [[Jineology|Jineologî]] or "women's science", in order to give to women access to knowledge, the very foundation of power in society.&lt;ref&gt;M. Knapp, A. Flach, E. Ayboga and J. Biehl, ''Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan'', London, Pluto Press, 2016, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, political emancipation is not seen as sufficient to ensure women's liberation if it does not rest on the possibility of women for self-defense. Therefore, Kurdish women created the Women's Protection Units ([[Women's Protection Units|YPJ]]) which forms, along with the People's Protection Units ([[People's Protection Units|YPG]]), the Kurdish armed forces.

The [[Rojava]] cantons are governed through a combination of district and civil councils. District councils consist of 300 members as well as two elected co-presidents- one man and one woman. District councils decide and carry out administrative and economic duties such as garbage collection, land distribution and cooperative enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tax |first1=Meredith |title=The Revolution in Rojava |url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/the-revolution-in-rojava|publisher=Dissent Magazin|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; `

==Democratic reform trilemma==
Democratic theorists have identified a [[trilemma]] due to the presence of three desirable characteristics of an ideal system of direct democracy, which are challenging to deliver all at once.  These three characteristics are ''participation'' – widespread participation in the decision making process by the people affected; ''deliberation'' – a rational discussion where all major points of view are weighted according to evidence; and ''equality'' –  all members of the population on whose behalf decisions are taken have an equal chance of having their views taken into account. [[Empirical evidence]] from dozens of studies suggests deliberation leads to better decision making.&lt;ref name="Ross 2011 loc= Chapter 3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ross|2011|loc= Chapter 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stokes1998&gt;{{Harvnb|Stokes|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Even Susan Strokes in her critical essay ''Pathologies of Deliberation'' concedes that a majority of academics in the field agree with this view.&lt;/ref&gt; The most popularly disputed form of direct popular participation is the referendum on constitutional matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juridicainternational.eu/index.php?id=15331 Jarinovska, K. "Popular Initiatives as Means of Altering the Core of the Republic of Latvia", ''Juridica International''.], {{ISSN|1406-5509}} Vol. 20, 2013. p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

For the system to respect the principle of political equality, either ''everyone'' needs to be involved or there needs to be a representative random sample of people chosen to take part in the discussion. In the definition used by scholars such as [[James S. Fishkin|James Fishkin]], [[deliberative democracy]] is a form of direct democracy which satisfies the requirement for deliberation and equality but does not make provision to involve everyone who wants to be included in the discussion. [[Participatory democracy]], by Fishkin's definition, allows inclusive participation and deliberation, but at a cost of sacrificing equality, because if widespread participation is allowed, sufficient resources rarely will be available to compensate people who sacrifice their time to participate in the deliberation. Therefore, participants tend to be those with a strong interest in the issue to be decided and often will not therefore be representative of the overall population.&lt;ref&gt;Fishkin suggests they may even have been directly mobilised by interest groups or be largely composed of people who have fallen for political propaganda and so have inflamed and distorted opinions.&lt;/ref&gt; Fishkin instead argues that random sampling should be used to select a small, but still representative, number of people from the general public.&lt;ref name="FishkinCh2&amp;3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross 2011 loc= Chapter 3"/&gt;

Fishkin concedes it is possible to imagine a system that transcends the trilemma, but it would require very radical reforms if such a system were to be integrated into mainstream politics.

==Relation to other movements==
[[File:Nuit Debout - Place Commune, 2016.05.14 (2).jpg|thumb|Practicing direct democracy – voting on Nuit Debout, Place de la République, Paris]]
Anarchists have advocated forms of direct democracy as an alternative to the centralized state and capitalism; however, others (such as [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]) have criticized direct democracy and democracy in general for ignoring the [[minority rights|rights of the minority]], and instead have advocated a form of [[consensus decision-making]]. [[Libertarian Marxism|Libertarian Marxists]], however, fully support direct democracy in the form of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat|proletarian republic]] and see majority rule and citizen participation as virtues. The [[Young Communist League USA]] in particular refers to representative democracy as "bourgeois democracy", implying that they see direct democracy as "true democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=membership Cmte |url=http://yclusa.org/article/articleview/1445/1/278/ |title=Young Communist League USA&amp;nbsp;– Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Yclusa.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DomainKeys Identified Mail''' ('''DKIM''') is an [[email authentication]] method designed to detect forged sender addresses in emails, ([[email spoofing]]), a technique often used in [[phishing]] and [[email spam]]. 

DKIM allows the receiver to check that an email claimed to have come from a specific [[domain name|domain]] was indeed authorized by the owner of that domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Service Overview |rfc=5585 |author1=Tony Hansen |author2=Dave Crocker |author3=[[Phillip Hallam-Baker]] |year=2009 |month=July |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=6 January 2016 |quote=Receivers who successfully verify a signature can use information about the signer as part of a program to limit spam, spoofing, phishing, or other undesirable behaviors.  DKIM does not, itself, prescribe any specific actions by the recipient; rather, it is an enabling technology for services that do.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It achieves this by affixing a [[digital signature]], linked to a domain name, to each outgoing email message.  The recipient system can verify this by looking up the signer's [[public-key cryptography|public key]] published in the [[domain name system|DNS]].  A valid signature also guarantees that some parts of the email (possibly including [[Email attachment|attachments]]) have not been modified since the signature was affixed.&lt;ref name="rfc6376-data_integrity"&gt;{{cite IETF |title=DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures |rfc=6376 |sectionname=Data Integrity |section=1.5 |editor1=Dave Crocker  |editor2=Tony Hansen  |editor3=Murray S.

DKIM is defined in RFC 6376, dated  September 2011, as a "Proposed standard".&lt;ref&gt;[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6376/ RFC 6376 Status]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

DKIM resulted in 2004 from merging two similar efforts, "enhanced DomainKeys" from [[Yahoo]] and "Identified Internet Mail" from [[Cisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dkim.org/info/dkim-faq.html |title=DKIM Frequently Asked Questions |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=16 October 2007 |website=DKIM.org |access-date=4 January 2016 |quote=DKIM was produced by an industry consortium in 2004.

"Identified Internet Mail" was proposed by [[Cisco]] as a signature-based mail authentication standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427023421/http://www.identifiedmail.com/| archive-date=27 April 2006 |dead-url=yes |url=http://www.identifiedmail.com/ |title=Identified Internet Mail: A network based message signing approach to combat email fraud |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=26 April 2006 |access-date=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Identified Internet Mail |draft=draft-fenton-identified-mail-00 |author1=Jim Fenton |author2=Michael Thomas |date=1 June 2004 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
while DomainKeys was designed by [[Yahoo]]&lt;ref name=yahoo /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmnews.com/digital-marketing/yahoo-releases-specs-for-domainkeys/article/84245/ "May 19, 2004 Yahoo Releases Specs for DomainKeys"]&lt;/ref&gt; to verify the [[DNS domain]] of an [[e-mail]] sender and the [[message integrity]].

Aspects of DomainKeys, along with parts of Identified Internet Mail, were combined to create DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM).&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;Delany, Mark (May 22, 2007). [http://ycorpblog.com/2007/05/22/one-small-step-for-email-one-giant-leap-for-internet-safety/ "One small step for email, one giant leap for Internet safety"]. Yahoo! corporate blog. Delany is credited as Chief Architect, inventor of DomainKeys.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RFC 4870 ("Domain-Based Email Authentication Using Public Keys Advertised in the DNS (DomainKeys)"; obsoleted by RFC 4871).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RFC 6376 ("DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures"; obsoletes RFC 4871 and RFC 5672).&lt;/ref&gt;
Trendsetting providers implementing DKIM include [[Yahoo]], [[Gmail]], [[AOL]] and [[FastMail]].

DKIM became one of the two pillars on which [[DMARC]] was founded, in the early 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dmarc.org/about/history/ |title=History |website=dmarc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions about DKIM signatures passing through indirect mail flows, formally in the DMARC working group, took place right after the first adoptions of the new protocol wreaked havoc on regular [[Electronic mailing list#Discussion list|mailing list]] use.  However, none of the proposed DKIM changes passed.  Instead, mailing list software was changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dmarc/history/ |title=DMARC Group History |website=[[IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, another working group was launched, DKIM Crypto Update (dcrup), with the specific restriction to review signing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dcrup/about/ |title=DKIM Crypto Update (dcrup) |website=[[IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  RFC 8301 was issued in January 2018.  It bans [[SHA-1]] and updates key sizes (from 512-2048 to 1024-4096).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Cryptographic Algorithm and Key Usage Update to DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) |rfc=8301 |author=Scott Kitterman |year=2018 |month=January |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  RFC 8463 was issued in September 2018.  It adds an [[Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm|elliptic curve algorithm]] to the existing [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]].  The added key type, &lt;code&gt;k=ed[[Curve25519|25519]]&lt;/code&gt; is adequately strong while featuring short public keys, more easily publishable in DNS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=A New Cryptographic Signature Method for DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) |rfc=8463 |author=John Levine |year=2018 |month=September |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
The original ''DomainKeys'' was designed by [[Mark Delany]] of Yahoo! and enhanced through comments from many others since 2004.  It is specified in Historic RFC 4870, superseded by Standards Track RFC 4871, DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures; both published in May 2007.  A number of clarifications and conceptualizations were collected thereafter and specified in RFC 5672, August 2009, in the form of corrections to the existing specification.  In September 2011, RFC 6376 merged and updated the latter two documents, while preserving the substance of the DKIM protocol.  Public key compatibility with the earlier DomainKeys is also possible.

DKIM was initially produced by an informal industry consortium and was then submitted for enhancement and standardization by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] DKIM Working Group, chaired by [[Barry Leiba]] and Stephen Farrell, with 
[[Eric Allman]] of [[sendmail]],
[[Jon Callas]] of [[PGP Corporation]], [[Mark Delany]] and Miles Libbey of [[Yahoo!]], and Jim Fenton and Michael Thomas of [[Cisco Systems]] attributed as primary authors.

Source code development of one common library is led by ''The OpenDKIM Project'', following the most recent protocol additions, and licensing under the [[BSD licenses#3-clause license ("New BSD License")|New BSD License]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opendkim.org/ |title=OpenDKIM |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
DKIM provides for two distinct operations, signing and verifying.  Either of them can be handled by a module of a [[mail transfer agent]] (MTA). The signing organization can be a direct handler of the message, such as the author, the [[Mail submission agent|submission]] site or a further intermediary along the transit path, or an indirect handler such as an independent service that is providing assistance to a direct handler.  Signing modules insert one or more &lt;code&gt;DKIM-Signature:&lt;/code&gt; header fields, possibly on behalf of the ''author'' organization or the originating service provider. Verifying modules typically act on behalf of the ''receiver'' organization, possibly at each [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol#Hop|hop]].

The need for this type of validated identification arose because [[email spam|spam]] often has forged addresses and content. For example, a spam message may claim to be from sender@example.com, although it is not actually from that address or domain or entity, and the spammer's goal is to convince the recipient to accept and to read the email. It is difficult for recipients to establish whether to trust or distrust any particular message or even domain, and system administrators may have to deal with complaints about spam that appears to have originated from their systems but did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jason-p-stadtlander/email-spoofing-explained-_1_b_6477672.html |title=Email Spoofing: Explained (and How to Protect Yourself) |author=Jason P. Stadtlander |date= 16 January 2015 |publisher=[[HuffPost]] |access-date=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DKIM specification allows signers to choose which [[E-mail header|header fields]] they sign, but the &lt;code&gt;From:&lt;/code&gt; field must always be signed.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite IETF |title=DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures |rfc=6376 |sectionname=Determine the Header Fields to Sign |section=5.4 |editor2=Tony Hansen |editor1=Dave Crocker |editor3=Murray S. Kucherawy |year=2009 |month=July |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=6 January 2016 |quote=The From header field MUST be signed (that is, included in the "h=" tag of the resulting DKIM-Signature header field).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
DKIM allows the signer (''author'' organization) to communicate which emails  it considers legitimate. It does not directly prevent or disclose abusive behavior. This ability to distinguish legitimate mail from potentially forged mail has benefits for recipients of e-mail as well as senders.

DKIM is independent of [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP) routing aspects in that it operates on the RFC 5322 message—the transported mail's header and body—not the SMTP envelope defined in RFC 5321.  Hence the DKIM signature survives basic relaying across multiple MTAs.

=== Technical details ===
The &lt;code&gt;DKIM-Signature&lt;/code&gt; header field consists of a list of &lt;code&gt;tag=value&lt;/code&gt; parts. Tags are short, usually only one or two letters. The most relevant ones are '''b''' for the actual digital signature of the contents (headers and body) of the mail message, '''bh''' for the body hash, '''d''' for the signing domain, and '''s''' for the selector. The default parameters for the [[authentication]] mechanism are to use [[SHA-256]] as the [[cryptographic hash]] and [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] as the [[public key encryption]] scheme, and encode the encrypted hash using [[Base64]].

Both header and body contribute to the signature.  First, the message body is hashed, always from the beginning, possibly truncated at a given length (which may be zero).  Second, selected header fields are hashed, in the order given by '''h'''.  Repeated field names are matched from the bottom of the header upward, which is the order in which &lt;code&gt;Received:&lt;/code&gt; fields are inserted in the header.  A non-existing field matches the empty string, so that adding a field with that name will break the signature.  The &lt;code&gt;DKIM-Signature:&lt;/code&gt; field of the signature being created, with '''bh''' equal to the computed body hash and '''b''' equal to the empty string, is implicitly added to the second hash, albeit its name must not appear in '''h''' —if it does, it refers to another, preexisting signature.  For both hashes, text is canonicalized according to the relevant '''c''' algorithms.  The result, after encryption with the private key and encoding using Base64, is '''b'''.  Algorithms, fields, and body length are meant to be chosen so as to assure unambiguous message identification while still allowing signatures to survive the unavoidable changes which are going to occur in transit.  No data integrity is implied.&lt;ref name="rfc6376-data_integrity"/&gt;

The receiving [[SMTP]] server uses the domain name and the selector to perform a DNS lookup. For example, given the signature
&lt;pre&gt;
DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; d=example.net; s=brisbane;
     c=relaxed/simple; q=dns/txt; l=1234; t=1117574938; x=1118006938;
     h=from:to:subject:date:keywords:keywords;
     bh=MTIzNDU2Nzg5MDEyMzQ1Njc4OTAxMjM0NTY3ODkwMTI=;
     b=dzdVyOfAKCdLXdJOc9G2q8LoXSlEniSbav+yuU4zGeeruD00lszZ
              VoG4ZHRNiYzR
&lt;/pre&gt;
A verifier queries the [[TXT Record|TXT]] resource record type of &lt;code&gt;brisbane._domainkey.example.net&lt;/code&gt;. Here, &lt;code&gt;example.net&lt;/code&gt; is the ''author'' domain to be verified against (in the '''d''' field), &lt;code&gt;brisbane&lt;/code&gt; is a selector given in the '''s''' field while &lt;code&gt;_domainkey&lt;/code&gt; is a fixed part of the protocol. There are no [[Certificate authority|CAs]] nor revocation lists involved in DKIM key management, and the selector is a straightforward method to allow signers to add and remove keys whenever they wish—long lasting signatures for archival purposes are outside DKIM's scope. Some more tags are visible in the example:
* '''v''' is the version, 
* '''a''' is the signing algorithm, 
*'''d''' is the domain,
*'''s''' is the selector,
* '''c''' is the [[canonicalization]] algorithm(s) for header and body, 
* '''q''' is the default query method, 
* '''l''' is the length of the canonicalized part of the body that has been signed, 
* '''t''' is the signature timestamp, 
* '''x''' is its expire time, and 
* '''h''' is the list of signed header fields, repeated for fields that occur multiple times.

The data returned from the query is also a list of tag-value pairs. It includes the domain's [[public key]], along with other key usage tokens and flags. The receiver can use this to then decrypt the hash value in the header field and at the same time recalculate the hash value for the mail message (headers and body) that was received. If the two values match, this cryptographically proves that the mail was signed by the indicated domain and has not been tampered with in transit.

Signature verification failure does not force rejection of the message. Instead, the precise reasons why the authenticity of the message could not be proven should be made available to downstream and upstream processes. Methods for doing so may include sending back an [[Feedback Loop (email)|FBL message]], or adding an ''Authentication-Results'' header field to the message as described in RFC 7001.

=== Patent encumbrance===
DomainKeys is covered by {{US patent|6986049}} assigned to Yahoo! Inc. For the purpose of the DKIM [[IETF]] Working Group, Yahoo! released the now obsolete DK library under a dual license scheme: the ''DomainKeys Patent License Agreement v1.2'', an unsigned version of which can still be found,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://domainkeys.sourceforge.net/license/patentlicense1-2.html |title=Yahoo! DomainKeys Patent License Agreement v1.1 |year=2006 |publisher=[[SourceForge]]|quote=Yahoo!

== Advantages ==
The primary advantage of this system for e-mail recipients is in allowing the signing domain to reliably identify a stream of legitimate email, thereby allowing domain-based blacklists and whitelists to be more effective.&lt;ref name="falk_part_3"&gt;{{Cite web | last=Falk | first=J.D. | title=Searching for Truth in DKIM | url=http://www.circleid.com/posts/20090317_searching_for_truth_in_dkim_part_3/ | publisher=CircleID | date=March 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also likely to make certain kinds of [[phishing]] attacks easier to detect.

There are some incentives for mail senders to sign outgoing e-mail:
* It allows a great reduction in abuse desk work for DKIM-enabled domains if e-mail receivers use the DKIM system to identify forged e-mail messages claiming to be from that domain.
* The domain owner can then focus its abuse team energies on its own users who actually are making inappropriate use of that domain.

=== Use with spam filtering ===
DKIM is a method of labeling a message, and it does not itself filter or identify spam. 
However, widespread use of DKIM can prevent spammers from forging the source address of their messages, a technique they commonly employ today. 
If spammers are forced to show a correct source domain, other filtering techniques can work more effectively. 
In particular, the source domain can feed into a [[reputation system]] to better identify spam. 
Conversely, DKIM can make it easier to identify mail that is known not to be spam and need not be filtered. 
If a receiving system has a whitelist of known good sending domains, either locally maintained or from third party certifiers, it can skip the filtering on signed mail from those domains, and perhaps filter the remaining mail more aggressively.&lt;ref name="falk_part_3" /&gt;

=== Anti-phishing ===
DKIM can be useful as an anti-[[phishing]] technology. Mailers in heavily phished domains can sign their mail to show that it is
genuine. Recipients can take the absence of a valid signature on mail from those domains to be an indication that the mail is probably forged. The best way to determine the set of domains that merit this degree of scrutiny remains an open question. DKIM used to have an optional feature called [[Author Domain Signing Practices|ADSP]] that lets authors that sign all their mail self-identify, but it was demoted to historic status in November 2013.&lt;ref name=historic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/status-change-adsp-rfc5617-to-historic/ |title=Change the status of ADSP (RFC 5617) to Historic |author=Barry Leiba |date=2013-11-25 |publisher=[[IETF]] |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, [[DMARC]] can be used for the same purpose&lt;ref name="dmarc_wiki"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dmarc.org/wiki/FAQ#What_happens_if_a_sender_uses_DMARC_and_ADSP.3F |title=FAQ - DMARC Wiki |format= |work= |accessdate=|quote=The DMARC standard states in Section 6.7, “Policy Enforcement Considerations,” that if a DMARC policy is discovered the receiver must disregard policies advertised through other means such as SPF or ADSP.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allows domains to self-publish which techniques (including [[Sender Policy Framework|SPF]] and DKIM) they employ, which makes it easier for the receiver to make an informed decision whether a certain mail is spam or not.&lt;ref name="add_dmarc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://support.google.com/a/answer/2466563?hl=en |title=Add a DMARC record - Google Apps Administrator Help |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, using DMARC, [[eBay]] and [[PayPal]] both publish policies that all of their mail is authenticated, and requesting that any receiving system, such as [[Gmail]], should reject any that is not.&lt;ref name="about_dmarc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://support.google.com/a/answer/2466580?hl=en |title=About DMARC - Google Apps Administrator Help |format= |work= |accessdate=|quote=Your policy can be strict or relaxed. For example, eBay and PayPal publish a policy requiring all of their mail to be authenticated in order to appear in someone's inbox. In accordance with their policy, Google rejects all messages from eBay or PayPal that aren’t authenticated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compatibility ===
Because it is implemented using DNS records and an added RFC 5322 header field, DKIM is compatible with the existing e-mail infrastructure. In particular, it is transparent to existing e-mail systems that lack DKIM support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Service Overview |rfc=5585 |author1=Tony Hansen |author2=Dave Crocker |author3=Phillip Hallam-Baker |year=2009 |month=July |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This design approach also is compatible with other, related services, such as the [[S/MIME]] and [[OpenPGP]] content-protection standards.
DKIM is compatible with the [[DNSSEC]] standard and with [[Sender Policy Framework|SPF]].

=== Protocol overhead ===
DKIM requires cryptographic checksums to be generated for each message sent through a mail server, which results in [[overhead (computing)|computational overhead]] not otherwise required for e-mail delivery. This additional computational overhead is a hallmark of digital postmarks, making sending bulk spam more (computationally) expensive.&lt;ref&gt;Roic, Alessio (July 5, 2007). [http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2007/07/05/postmarking-helping-the-fight-against-spam.aspx "Postmarking: helping the fight against spam"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717141250/http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2007/07/05/postmarking-helping-the-fight-against-spam.aspx |date=July 17, 2011 }}. Microsoft Office Outlook Blog.&lt;/ref&gt;
This facet of DKIM may look similar to [[hashcash]], except that the receiver side verification is not a negligible amount of work, and a typical hashcash algorithm would require far more work.

=== Non-repudiability ===
DKIM's [[non-repudiation]] feature prevents senders (such as spammers) from credibly denying having sent an email.  It has proven useful to news media sources such as [[WikiLeaks]], which has been able to leverage DKIM body signatures to prove that leaked emails were genuine and not tampered with, definitively repudiating claims by [[Hillary Clinton]]'s [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 US Presidential Election]] running mate [[Tim Kaine]], and [[Democratic National Committee|DNC]] Chair [[Donna Brazile]].&lt;ref name="WikiLeaks"&gt;

== Weaknesses ==

The RFC itself identifies a number of potential attack vectors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6376#section-8 "Security considerations"], ietf.org&lt;/ref&gt;

DKIM signatures do not encompass the message envelope, which holds the [[return-path]] and message recipients. Since DKIM does not attempt to protect against mis-addressing, this does not affect its utility.

A concern for any cryptographic solution would be [[replay attack|message replay]]
abuse, which bypasses techniques that currently limit the level of abuse from larger domains.{{Clarify|date=July 2015}} Replay can be inferred by using per-message public keys, tracking the DNS queries for those keys and filtering out the high number of queries due to e-mail being sent to large mailing lists or malicious queries by bad actors.

For a comparison of different methods also addressing this problem see [[e-mail authentication]].

===Arbitrary forwarding===
As mentioned above, authentication is not the same as abuse prevention.  An evil email user of a reputable domain can compose a bad message and have it DKIM-signed and sent from that domain to any mailbox from where they can retrieve it as a file, so as to obtain a signed copy of the message.  Use of the '''l''' tag in signatures makes doctoring such messages even easier. The signed copy can then be forwarded to a million recipients, for example through a [[botnet]], without control. The email provider who signed the message can block the offending user, but cannot stop the diffusion of already-signed messages. The validity of signatures in such messages can be limited by always including an expiration time tag in signatures, or by revoking a public key periodically or upon a notification of an incident. Effectiveness of the scenario can hardly be limited by filtering outgoing mail, as that implies the ability to detect if a message might potentially be useful to spammers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Analysis of Threats Motivating DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) |rfc=4686 |sectionname=Chosen Message Replay |section=4.1.4 |author=Jim Fenton  |year=2006 |month=September |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content modification===
DKIM currently features two [[canonicalization]] algorithms, &lt;tt&gt;simple&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;relaxed&lt;/tt&gt;, neither of which is [[MIME]]-aware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/yam/current/msg00381.html |title=secdir review of draft-ietf-yam-rfc1652bis-03 |author=[[Ned Freed]] (with agreement by [[John Klensin]]) |date=March 5, 2010 |work=YAM mailing list |publisher=[[IETF]] |quote=DKIM WG opted for canonical form simplicity over a canonical form that's robust in the face of encoding changes. It was their engineering choice to make and they made it. |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mail servers can legitimately convert to a different character set, and often document this with ''X-MIME-Autoconverted'' header fields. In addition, servers in certain circumstances have to rewrite the MIME structure, thereby altering the ''preamble'', the ''epilogue'', and entity boundaries, any of which breaks DKIM signatures. Only plain text messages written in [[ASCII|us-ascii]], provided that MIME header fields are not signed,&lt;ref&gt;RFC 2045 allows a parameter value to be either a token or a quoted-string, e.g. in &lt;tt&gt;format="flowed"&lt;/tt&gt; the quotes can be legally removed, which breaks DKIM signatures.&lt;/ref&gt; enjoy the robustness that end-to-end integrity requires.

The OpenDKIM Project organized a data collection involving 21 mail servers and millions of messages. 92.3% of observed signatures were successfully verified, a success rate that drops slightly (90.5%) when only mailing list traffic is considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ietf.org/iesg/implementation/report-rfc4871.txt |title=RFC4871 Implementation Report |date=March 28, 2011 |author=Kucherawy, Murray |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=2012-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Annotations by mailing lists====
The problems might be exacerbated when filtering or relaying software makes changes to a message. Without specific precaution implemented by the sender, the footer addition operated by most [[Electronic mailing list|mailing lists]] and many central [[Antivirus software|antivirus]] solutions will break the DKIM signature. A possible mitigation is to sign only designated number of bytes of the message body. It is indicated by '''l''' tag in '''DKIM-Signature''' header. Anything added beyond the specified length of the message body is not taken into account while calculating DKIM signature.  This won't work for MIME messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) and Mailing Lists |rfc=6377 |author=Murray S. Kucherawy |year=2011 |month=September |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another workaround is to whitelist known forwarders; e.g., by [[Sender Policy Framework|SPF]]. For yet another workaround, it was proposed that forwarders verify the signature, modify the email, and then re-sign the message with a Sender: header.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=DKIM Sender Signing Practices |draft=draft-allman-dkim-ssp-02 |sectionname=Mailing List Manager Actions |section=5.1 |author1=Eric Allman |author2=Mark Delany |author3=Jim Fenton  |year=2006 |month=August |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it should be noted that this solution has its risk with forwarded 3rd party signed messages received at SMTP receivers supporting the RFC 5617 [[Author Domain Signing Practices|ADSP]] protocol. Thus, in practice, the receiving server still has to whitelist known ''message streams''.

===Short key vulnerability===
In October 2012, ''Wired'' reported that mathematician Zach Harris detected and demonstrated an email source spoofing vulnerability with short DKIM keys for the &lt;code&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt; corporate domain, as well as several other high-profile domains. He stated that authentication with 384-bit keys can be factored in as little as 24 hours "on my laptop," and 512-bit keys, in about 72 hours with cloud computing resources.  Harris found that many organizations sign email with such short keys; he factored them all and notified the organizations of the vulnerability. He states that 768-bit keys could be factored with access to very large amounts of computing power, so he suggests that DKIM signing should use key lengths greater than 1,024. 

''Wired'' stated that Harris reported, and Google confirmed, that they began using new longer keys soon after his disclosure. According to RFC 6376 the receiving party must be able to validate signatures with keys ranging from 512 bits to 2048 bits, thus usage of keys shorter than 512 bits might be incompatible and shall be avoided. The RFC 6376 also states that signers must use keys of at least 1024 bits for long-lived keys, though long-livingness is not specified there.&lt;ref&gt;Zetter, Kim (October 24, 2012).

A '''drug test''' is a technical analysis of a [[biological specimen]], for example [[urine]], [[hair]], [[blood]], [[breath]], [[sweat]], and/or [[saliva|oral fluid/saliva]] — to determine the presence or absence of specified parent drugs or their [[metabolite]]s. Major applications of drug testing include detection of the presence of [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|performance enhancing]] [[steroid]]s in sport, employers and [[parole]]/[[probation]] officers screening for [[Prohibition (drugs)|drugs prohibited]] by law (such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[cocaine]], [[methamphetamine]], and [[heroin]]) and [[police officers]] testing for the presence and concentration of [[alcoholic drink|alcohol]] ([[ethanol]]) in the blood commonly referred to as [[Blood alcohol content|BAC]] (blood alcohol content).  BAC tests are typically administered via a [[breathalyzer]] while [[urinalysis]] is used for the vast majority of drug testing in [[sports]] and the [[workplace]]. Numerous other methods with varying degrees of accuracy, sensitivity (detection threshold/cutoff), and detection periods exist.

A drug test may also refer to [[illegal drug trade|a test]] that provides quantitative [[chemical analysis]] of an [[illegal drug]], typically intended to help with [[responsible drug use]].&lt;ref name=inde1&gt;{{cite web|title=I spent my weekend testing drugs at a festival|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/secret-garden-party-drugs-service-i-tested-drugs-at-festival-service-for-everyone-a7155376.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=18 May 2017|date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection periods==
The following chart gives approximate detection periods for each substance by test type.&lt;ref name="reference guide"&gt;[https://nebula.wsimg.com/f9798210579e56d22dd4c3facc3cf7fa?AccessKeyId=020EF4172A625EEA5605&amp;disposition=0&amp;alloworigin=1 "Drugs of Abuse Reference Guide,"] ''Pinnacle BioLabs'', Retrieved online April 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The detection windows depend upon multiple factors: drug class, amount and frequency of use, metabolic rate, body mass, age, overall health, and urine pH. For ease of use, the detection times of [[metabolite]]s have been incorporated into each parent drug. For example, heroin and cocaine can only be detected for a few hours after use, but their metabolites can be detected for several days in urine. The chart depicts the longer detection times of the metabolites.

Oral fluid or [[saliva testing]] results for the most part mimic that of blood. The only exceptions are THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and benzodiazepines. Oral fluid will likely detect THC from ingestion up to a maximum period of 6–12 hours. This continues to cause difficulty in oral fluid detection of THC and benzodiazepines.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Transportation: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (DOT HS 810 704). ''Pilot Test of New Roadside Survey Methodology for Impaired Driving''. January, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Breath air for the most part mimics blood tests as well. Due to the very low levels of substances in the breath air, liquid chromatography—mass spectrometry has to be used to analyze the sample according to a recent publication wherein 12 analytes were investigated.

Rapid oral fluid products are not approved for use in workplace drug testing programs and are not FDA cleared. Using rapid oral fluid drug tests in the workplace is prohibited in only:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.singlesourceservices.com/drug-test-kits/Statebystatelaw_800059vA_0611.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125024950/http://www.singlesourceservices.com/drug-test-kits/Statebystatelaw_800059vA_0611.pdf |archivedate=January 25, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Urine drug screen===
{{main article|Urinalysis}}
Urine analysis is primarily used because of its low cost. Urine drug testing is one of the most common testing methods used. The enzyme-multiplied immune test is the most frequently used urinalysis. Complaints have been made about the relatively high rates of false positives using this test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Drug use and abuse: A comprehensive introduction|last = Abadinsky|first = H.|publisher = Wadsworth Cengage Learning|year = 2014|isbn = 9781285070278|location = Belmont|pages = 163–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urine drug tests screen the urine for the presence of a parent drug or its metabolites. The level of drug or its metabolites is not predictive of when the drug was taken or how much the patient used. Rather, it is simply a confirmatory report indicating the presence of the parent drug or its metabolites.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Urine drug testing is an [[immunoassay]] based on the principle of competitive binding. Drugs which may be present in the urine specimen compete against their respective drug conjugate for binding sites on their specific antibody. During testing, a urine specimen migrates upward by capillary action. A drug, if present in the urine specimen below its cut-off concentration, will not saturate the binding sites of its specific antibody. The antibody will then react with the drug-protein conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test line region of the specific drug strip.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

When an employer requests a drug test from an employee, or a physician requests a drug test from a patient, the employee or patient is typically instructed to go to a collection site or their home. The urine sample goes through a specified 'chain of custody' to ensure that it is not tampered with or invalidated through lab or employee error. The patient or employee’s urine is collected at a remote location in a specially designed secure cup, sealed with tamper-resistant tape, and sent to a testing laboratory to be screened for drugs (typically the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] 5 panel). The first step at the testing site is to split the urine into two [[wikt:aliquot|aliquots]]. One aliquot is first screened for drugs using an analyzer that performs immunoassay as the initial screen. To ensure the specimen integrity and detecting possible adulterant, some other parameters such as, [[Creatinine|urine creatinine]], pH, and [[specific gravity]] are tested along in this initial test. If the urine screen is positive then another aliquot of the sample is used to confirm the findings by [[gas chromatography]]—[[mass spectrometry]] (GC-MS) or [[LC/MS|liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry]] methodology. If requested by the physician or employer, certain drugs are screened for individually; these are generally drugs part of a chemical class that are, for one of many reasons, considered more abuse-prone or of concern. For instance, [[oxycodone]] and [[diamorphine]] may be tested, both [[sedative]] [[analgesics]]. If such a test is not requested specifically, the more general test (in the preceding case, the test for opiates) will detect the drugs, but the employer or physician will not have the benefit of the identity of the drug.

Employment-related test results are relayed to a medical review office (MRO) where a medical physician reviews the results. If the result of the screen is negative, the MRO informs the employer that the employee has no detectable drug in the urine, typically within 24 hours. However, if the test result of the immunoassay and GC-MS are non-negative and show a concentration level of parent drug or metabolite above the established limit, the MRO contacts the employee to determine if there is any legitimate reason—such as a medical treatment or prescription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Review Officer Manual|url=http://workplace.samhsa.gov/DrugTesting/pdf/MRO_Manual_2010_100908.pdf|work=Medical Review Officer Manual|publisher=SAMSHA Gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215084325/http://workplace.samhsa.gov/DrugTesting/pdf/MRO_Manual_2010_100908.pdf|archivedate=February 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On-site instant drug testing is a more cost-efficient method of effectively detecting drug abuse amongst employees, as well as in rehabilitation programs to monitor patient progress.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} These instant tests can be used for both urine and saliva testing. Although the accuracy of such tests varies with the manufacturer, some kits boast extremely high rates of accuracy, correlating closely with laboratory test results.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.confirmbiosciences.com/knowledge/blog/everything-need-know-instant-drug-tests/ Article in ''Confirm Biosciences'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breath test ===
{{main article|Breathalyzer}}
[[File:Breathalyzer on citizen.jpg|thumb|204x204px|Breath test being used on a volunteer.]]
Breath test is a widespread method for quickly determining alcohol intoxication. A breath test measures the alcohol concentration in the body by a deep-lung breath. There are different instruments used for measuring the alcohol content of an individual though their breath. [[Breathalyzer]] is a widely known instrument which was developed in 1954 and contained chemicals unlike other breath-testing instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Forensic science: From the crime scene to the crime lab.|last = Saferstein|first = R.|publisher = Pearson Education Inc.|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0131391871|location = Upper Saddle River|pages = 295–300}}&lt;/ref&gt; More modernly used instruments are the infrared [[Spectrophotometry|light-absorption devices]] and [[fuel cell]] detectors, these two testers are microprocessor controlled meaning the operator only has to press the start button.

To get accurate readings on a breath-testing device the individual must blow for approximately 6 seconds and need to contain roughly 1.1 to 1.5 liters of breath. For a breath-test to result accurately and truly an operator must take steps such as avoiding measuring “mouth alcohol” which is a result from regurgitation, belching, or recent intake of an alcoholic beverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Forensic science: From the crime scene to the crime lab.|last = Saferstein|first = R.|publisher = Pearson Education|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0131391871|location = Upper Saddle River|pages = 295–303}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid measuring “mouth alcohol” the operator must not allow the individual that’s taking the test to consume any materials for at least fifteen minutes before the breath test. When pulled over for a driving violation if an individual in the United States refuses to take a breath test that individual's driver's license can be suspend for a 6 to 12 months time period.

===Hair testing===
{{main article|Hair analysis}}
Hair analysis to detect drugs of abuse has been used by court systems in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries worldwide. In the United States, hair testing has been accepted in court cases as forensic evidence following the Frye Rule, the Federal Rules of Evidence, and the Daubert Rule. As such, hair testing results are legally and scientifically recognized as admissible evidence. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Although some lower courts may have accepted hair test evidence, there is no controlling judicial ruling in either the federal or any state system declaring any type of hair test as reliable.

Hair testing is now recognized in both the UK and US judicial systems. There are guidelines for hair testing that have been published by the Society of Hair Testing (a private company in France) that specify the markers to be tested for and the cutoff concentrations that need to be tested.  Drugs of abuse that can be detected include Cannabis, Cocaine, Amphetamines and drugs new to the UK such as Mephedrone.

====Alcohol====
In contrast to other drugs consumed, alcohol is deposited directly in the hair. For this reason the investigation procedure looks for direct products of ethanol metabolism. The main part of alcohol is oxidized in the human body. This means it is released as water and carbon dioxide. One part of the alcohol reacts with fatty acids to produce esters. The sum of the concentrations of four of these fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs: ethyl myristate, ethyl palmitate, ethyl oleate and ethyl stearate) are used as indicators of the alcohol consumption. The amounts found in hair are measured in nanograms (one nanogram equals only one billionth of a gram), however with the benefit of modern technology, it is possible to detect such small amounts. In the detection of ethyl glucuronide, or EtG, testing can detect amounts in picograms (one picogram equals 0.001 nanograms).

However, there is one major difference between most drugs and alcohol metabolites in the way in which they enter into the hair: on the one hand like other drugs FAEEs enter into the hair via the keratinocytes, the cells responsible for hair growth. These cells form the hair in the root and then grow through the skin surface taking any substances with them. On the other hand, the sebaceous glands produce FAEEs in the scalp and these migrate together with the sebum along the hair shaft (Auwärter et al., 2001, Pragst et al., 2004). So these glands lubricate not only the part of the hair that is just growing at 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm per day on the skin surface, but also the more mature hair growth, providing it with a protective layer of fat.

FAEEs (nanogram = one billionth of a gram) appear in hair in almost one order of magnitude lower than (the relevant order of magnitude of) EtG (picogram = one trillionth of a gram). It has been technically possible to measure FAEEs since 1993, and the first study reporting the detection of EtG in hair was done by Sachs in 1993.&lt;ref name="Kintz"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pascal Kintz |title=Analytical and practical aspects of drug testing in hair |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBBq180lUEAC&amp;pg=PA305 |date=August 30, 2006 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8493-6450-1 |pages=305–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, most hair which is sent for analysis has been cosmetically treated in some way (bleached, permed etc.). It has been proven that FAEEs are not significantly affected by such treatments (Hartwig et al., 2003a). FAEE concentrations in hair from other body sites can be interpreted in a similar fashion as scalp hair (Hartwig et al., 2003b).

===Presumptive substance testing===
Presumptive substance tests identify a suspicious substance, material or surface where traces of drugs are thought to be, instead of testing individuals through biological methods such as urine or hair testing. The test involves mixing the suspicious material with a chemical in order to trigger a color change to indicate if a drug is present. Most are now available over-the-counter, and do not require a lab to read results.
[[File:Duquenois Reagent.jpg|thumb|174x174px|Duquenois reagent]]
Benefits to this method include that the person who is suspected of drug use does not need to be confronted or aware of testing.  Only a very small amount of material is needed to obtain results, and can be used to test powder, pills, capsules, crystals, or organic material. There is also the ability to detect illicit material when mixed with other non-illicit materials. The tests are used for general screening purposes, offering a generic result for the presence of a wide range of drugs, including Heroin, Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Amphetamine, Ecstasy/MDMA, Methadone, Ketamine, PCP, PMA, DMT, MDPV, and may detect rapidly evolving synthetic designer drugs. Separate tests for Marijuana/Hashish are also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touch-know.com/Drug-Test-Kit |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310225824/http://www.touch-know.com/Drug-Test-Kit |archivedate=March 10, 2014 |df=mdy }}. Touch-know.com. Retrieved on March 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five primary color-tests reagents used for general screening purposes. The [[Marquis reagent]] turns into a variety of colors when in the presence of different substances. [[Dille–Koppanyi reagent|Dille-Koppanyi reagent]] uses two chemical solutions which turns a violet-blue color in the presence of barbiturates. [[Duquenois–Levine reagent|Duquenois-Levine reagent]] is a series of chemical solutions that turn to the color of purple when the vegetation of marijuana is added. [[Ehrlich's reagent|Van Urk reagent]] turns blue-purple when in the presence of LSD. Scott Test's chemical solution shows up as a faint blue for cocaine base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Forensic science:From the crime scene to the crime lab|last = Saferstein|first = Richard|publisher = Pearson Education Inc|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0131391871|location = Upper Saddle River|pages = 271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saliva drug screen / Oral fluid-based drug screen===
[[Saliva]] / oral fluid-based drug tests can generally detect use during the previous few days. Is better at detecting very recent use of a substance. THC may only be detectable for 2–24 hours in most cases. On site drug tests are allowed per the Department of Labor.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Detection in saliva tests begins almost immediately upon use of the following substances, and lasts for approximately the following times:

* Alcohol: 6-12 h&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/testing/testing_info1.shtml Drug Testing Basics&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marijuana]]: 1-24h

A disadvantage of saliva based drug testing is that it is not approved by FDA or SAMHSA for use with DOT / Federal Mandated Drug Testing. Oral fluid is not considered a bio-hazard unless there is visible blood; however, it should be treated with care.

===Sweat drug screen===
Sweat patches are attached to the skin to collect sweat over a long period of time (up to 14 days).&lt;ref name="Drug Test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aboutdrugtesting.org/drug_test.htm|title=Drug Test|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are used by child protective services, parole departments, and other government institutions concerned with drug use over long periods, when urine testing is not practical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/167/thepatch.shtml|title=Federal Court Drug-Testing Device Under Fire, PharmChem Sweat Patch May Be "Too Good"|date=January 5, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also surface drug tests that test for the metabolite of parent drug groups in the residue of drugs left in sweat.

===Blood===
Drug-testing a blood sample measures whether or not a drug or a metabolite is in the body at a particular time. These types of tests are considered to be the most accurate way of telling if a person is intoxicated. Blood drug tests are not used very often because they need specialized equipment and medically trained administrators.

Depending on how much marijuana was consumed, it can usually be detected in blood tests within six hours of consumption. After six hours has passed, the concentration of marijuana in the blood decreases significantly. It generally disappears completely within 30 days.

===Anabolic steroids===
[[Anabolic steroid]]s are used to enhance performance in sports and as they are prohibited in most high-level competitions drug testing is used extensively in order to enforce this prohibition. This is particularly so in individual (rather than team) sports such as [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] and [[cycling]].

===Random drug testing===
Can occur at any time, usually when the investigator has reason to believe that a substance is possibly being abused by the subject by behavior or immediately after an employee-related incident occurs during work hours. Testing protocol typically conforms to the national medical standard, candidates are given up to 120 minutes to reasonably produce a urine sample from the time of commencement (in some instances this time frame may be extended at the examiners discretion).

===Diagnostic screening===
In the case of life-threatening symptoms, unconsciousness, or bizarre behavior in an emergency situation, screening for common drugs and toxins may help find the cause, called a ''toxicology test'' or ''tox screen'' to denote the broader area of possible substances beyond just self-administered drugs. These tests can also be done post-mortem during an autopsy in cases where a death was not expected. The test is usually done within 96 hours (4 days) after the desire for the test is realized. Both a urine sample and a blood sample may be tested.&lt;ref name=webmd&gt;[http://firstaid.webmd.com/toxicology-tests WebMD --&gt; Toxicology Tests] Author: Jeannette Curtis. Primary Medical Reviewer: Kathleen Romito, MD—Family Medicine. Specialist Medical Reviewer: R. Steven Tharratt, MD, MPVM, FACP, FCCP—Pulmonology, Critical Care, Medical Toxicology. Last Updated: May 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A blood sample is routinely used to detect [[ethanol]]/[[methanol]] and [[Acetylsalicylic acid|ASA]]/[[paracetamol]] intoxication. Various panels are used for screening urine samples for common substances, e.g. ''triage 8'' that detects [[amphetamines]], [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[cocaine]], [[methadone]], [[opiates]], cannabis, [[barbiturates]] and [[tricyclic antidepressants]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surrey.ac.uk/MDA/Pages/GuildfordEvaluations/PreviousReports/Reports/Drugs%20of%20abuse%20report.htm Sixteen devices for the detection of drugs of abuse in urine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811080853/http://www.surrey.ac.uk/MDA/Pages/GuildfordEvaluations/PreviousReports/Reports/Drugs%20of%20abuse%20report.htm |date=August 11, 2011 }} MHRA Report No. MHRA 03078. Report Date: October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Results are given in 10–15 min.

Similar screenings may be used to evaluate the possible use of [[date rape drug]]s. This is usually done on a urine sample.&lt;ref name=webmd/&gt;

==Methodologies==
Before testing samples, the [[tamper-evident]] seal is checked for integrity. If it appears to have been tampered with or damaged, the laboratory rejects the sample and does not test it.

Next, the sample must be made testable. Urine and oral fluid can be used "as is" for some tests, but other tests require the drugs to be extracted from urine. Strands of hair, patches, and blood must be prepared before testing. Hair is washed in order to eliminate second-hand sources of drugs on the surface of the hair, then the [[keratin]] is broken down using [[enzymes]]. [[Blood plasma]] may need to be separated by [[centrifuge]] from [[blood cells]] prior to testing. Sweat patches are opened and the sweat collection component is removed and soaked in a [[solvent]] to dissolve any drugs present.

Laboratory-based drug testing is done in two steps. The first step is the '''screening test''', which is an immunoassay based test applied to all samples. The second step, known as the confirmation test, is usually undertaken by a laboratory using highly specific chromatographic techniques and only applied to samples that test positive during the screening test.&lt;ref name="principles of drug testing technology"&gt;[http://www.drugtestsdirect.com.au/docs/other/principles-of-drug-testing-technology.pdf "Principles of Drug Testing Technology,"] ''Drug Tests Direct'', Retrieved online Dec 07, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Screening tests are usually done by [[immunoassay]] ([[Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique|EMIT]], [[ELISA]], and RIA are the most common). A "[[Wiktionary:dipstick|dipstick]]" drug testing method which could provide screening test capabilities to field investigators has been developed at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

After a suspected positive sample is detected during screening, the sample is tested using a '''confirmation test'''. Samples that are negative on the screening test are discarded and reported as negative. The confirmation test in most laboratories (and all [[SAMHSA]] certified labs) is performed using [[mass spectrometry]], and is precise but expensive. False positive samples from the screening test will almost always be negative on the confirmation test. Samples testing positive during both screening and confirmation tests are reported as positive to the entity that ordered the test. Most laboratories save positive samples for some period of months or years in the event of a disputed result or lawsuit. For workplace drug testing, a positive result is generally not confirmed without a review by a Medical Review Officer who will normally interview the subject of the drug test.

===Urine drug testing===
Urine drug test kits are available as on-site tests, or laboratory analysis. Urinalysis is the most common test type and used by federally mandated drug testing programs and is considered the Gold Standard of drug testing. Urine based tests have been upheld in most courts for more than 30 years. However, urinalysis conducted by the Department of Defense has been challenged for reliability of testing the metabolite of cocaine. There are two associated metabolites of cocaine, benzoylecgonine (BZ) and ecgonine methyl ester (EME), the first (BZ) is created by the presence of cocaine in an aqeous solution with a pH greater than 7.0, while the second (EME) results from the actual human metabolic process. The presence of EME confirms actual ingestion of cocaine by a human being, while the presence of BZ is indicative only. BZ without EME is evidence of sample contamination, however, the US Department of Defense has chosen not to test for EME in its urinalysis program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/books-of-the-year-2013-sport-8973040.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Chris | last=Maume | title=Books of the year 2013: Sport | date=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{relevance inline|date=October 2016}}

A number of different analyses (defined as the unknown substance being tested for) are available on Urine Drug Screens.

===Spray drug testing===
Spray (sweat) drug test kits are non-invasive. It is a simple process to collect the required specimen, no bathroom is needed, no laboratory is required for analysis, and the tests themselves are difficult to manipulate and relatively tamper-resistant. The detection window is long and can detect recent drug use within several hours.

There are also some disadvantages to spray or sweat testing. There is not much variety in these drug tests, only a limited number of drugs can be detected, prices tend to be higher, and inconclusive results can be produced by variations in sweat production rates in donors.  They also have a relatively long specimen collection period and are more vulnerable to contamination than other common forms of testing.&lt;ref name="Drug Test"/&gt;

===Hair drug testing===
Hair drug testing is a method that can detect drug use over a much longer period of time,&lt;ref name="Your hair tells all"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hairdrugtest.org|title=How Did I Pass My Drug Test - Personal Story|work=Best Way To Beat Any Drug Test!}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is often used for highly safety-critical positions where there is zero tolerance of illegal drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hatala|first=John W.|author-link=|date=June 2003|title=The Feasibility of Testing Hair for Illicit Drug Use in the United States Marine Corps|place=Monterey, California|publisher=[[Naval Postgraduate School]]|pages=2|url=http://www.usna.edu/IR/htmls/lead/database/cohort6/c06_hatala.pdf|accessdate =May 7, 2009|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standard hair follicle screen covers a period of 30 to 90 days. The growth of head hair is usually at the rate of 0.5&amp;nbsp;inches per month.&lt;ref name="zme"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.zmescience.com/other/science-abc/how-fast-hair-grows-042394/ |title=How fast hair grows, and other hairy science |last=Puiu |first=Tibi |date=August 23, 2018 |website=www.zmescience.com |publisher=ZME Science |access-date=September 28, 2018 |quote="The hair on your head grows about 6 inches a year." }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hair sample is cut close to the scalp and 80 to 120 strands of hair are needed for the test. In the absence of hair on the head, body hair can be used as an acceptable substitute.&lt;ref name="Your hair tells all"/&gt; This includes facial hair, the underarms, arms, and legs or even pubic hair. Because body hair grows at a different rate than head hair, the timeframe changes, with scientists estimating that drug use can be detected in body hair for up to 12 months. Currently, most entities that use hair testing have prescribed consequences for individuals removing hair to avoid a hair drug test.

The claim that a hair test cannot be tampered with has been shown to be debatable. One study has shown that [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] does not readily deposit inside epithelial cells so it is possible for cosmetic and other forms of adulteration to reduce the amount of testable cannabinoids within a hair sample.&lt;ref name="Kintz"/&gt;

==Legality, ethics and politics==
The results of federally mandating drug testing were similar to the effects of simply extending to the trucking industry the right to perform drug tests, and it has been argued that the latter approach would have been as effective at lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/345584 |title=Drug Testing in the Trucking Industry: The Effect on Highway Safety |author=Mireille Jacobson |journal=Journal of Law and Economics |volume=46 |issue=1 |date=April 2003 |pages=131–156|citeseerx=10.1.1.489.2439 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Tony Buon]] has criticized the use of workplace drug testing on a number of grounds, including:

# Flawed Technology: The real world performance of testing is much lower than that claimed by its promoters. Buon suggest that tests are probably adequate for rehabilitation and treatment situations, possibly adequate for pre-employment situations, but not for dismissing employees. 
# Ethical Issues: Because of the fairly simple ways that an employee can invalidate the test, drug testing must be strictly monitored.  This means that the specimen must be observed leaving the body. Many legal objections currently being raised in the courts about drug testing are pointing to legal requirements of prior notice, consent, due process, and cause.&lt;ref&gt;Buon, T (1996). Alcohol, Drug and Other Problems in Academia. Drugs In Society. 2/96 June. ADFQ. 8-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/23327644/does-testing-work|title=Does testing work?|work=ebscohost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Wrong focus: As has been shown with [[Employee Assistance Program]]s, the focus of management concern should be on work performance decline.  Buon suggests effective management practices are an infinitely better approach to managing workplace alcohol and other drug issues.&lt;ref&gt;Buon, Y. and Compton, B. 1994. "The Development of Alcohol and Other Drug Programs in the Workplace". In Stone, R. J. (ed.). ''Readings in Human Resource Management'' (Volume 2): 240–252. Brisbane: John Wiley Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tony Buon]] has also reported by the [[CIPD]] as stating that "drug testing captures the stupid—experienced drug users know how to beat the tests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cipd.co.uk/pm/peoplemanagement/b/weblog/archive/2013/01/29/doestestingwork-2006-11.aspx|title=Does testing work? - People Management Magazine Online|work=cipd.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a [[penology|penological]] standpoint, one purpose of drug testing is to help classify the 
people taking the drug test within risk groups so that those who pose more of a danger to the public can be [[incapacitation (penology)|incapacitated]] through incarceration or other restrictions on liberty. Thus, the drug testing serves a crime control purpose even if there is no expectation of [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitating]] the drug user through treatment, [[deterrence (penology)|deterring]] drug use through sanctions, or sending a message that drug use is a deviant behavior that will not be tolerated.&lt;ref name=newpenology&gt;{{cite journal|title=The New Penology: Notes on the Emerging Strategy of Corrections and Its Implications|volume=30|journal=Criminology|number=449|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
A study in 2004 by the Independent Inquiry into Drug Testing at Work found that attempts by employers to force employees to take drug tests could potentially be challenged as a violation of privacy under the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] and Article 8 of the [[European Convention of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not apply to industries where drug testing is a matter of personal and public safety or security rather than productivity.

===United States===
In consultation with Dr. Carlton Turner, President Ronald Reagan issued [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 12564. In doing so, he instituted mandatory drug-testing for all safety-sensitive executive-level and civil-service Federal employees. This was [[National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab|challenged in the courts]] by the [[National Treasury Employees Union]]. In 1988, this challenge was considered by the US Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;. National Treasury Employees Union v. von Raab. 86-1879, US Supreme Court, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar challenge resulted in the Court extending the drug-free workplace concept to the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Assoc. 87-15555. US Supreme Court, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; These decisions were then incorporated into the White House Drug Control Strategy directive issued by President George H.W. Bush in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0740-5472(90)90047-T | last1 = Miller | first1 = NS | last2 = Giannini | first2 = AJ | last3 = Gold | first3 = MS | last4 = Philomena | first4 = JA | title = Drug testing: medical, legal, and ethical issues. | journal=Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 239–44 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2290186 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; All defendants serving on [[federal probation]] or [[federal supervised release]] are required to submit to at least three drug tests. Failing a drug test can be construed as possession of a controlled substance, resulting in mandatory revocation and imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|18|3563}}, {{usc|18|3583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been inconsistent evaluation results as to whether continued pretrial drug testing has beneficial effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Pretrial Drug Testing: Panacea or Pandora's Box? |author=Christy A. Visher |journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |volume=521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing positive can lead to bail not being granted, or if bail has already been granted, to bail revocation or other sanctions. [[Arizona]] also adopted a law in 1987 authorizing mandatory drug testing of felony arrestees for the purpose of informing the [[pretrial release]] decision, and the [[District of Columbia]] has had a similar law since the 1970s. It has been argued that one of the problems with such testing is that there is often not enough time between the arrest and the bail decision to confirm positive results using GC/MS technology. It has also been argued that such testing potentially implicates the [[Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] [[privilege against self-incrimination]], the [[right to due process]] (including the prohibition against gathering evidence in a manner that [[shocks the conscience]] or constitutes [[outrageous government conduct]]), and the [[prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures]] contained in the [[Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Fourth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Constitutionality of Drug Testing at the Bail Stage |author=Cathryn Jo Rosen; John S. Goldkamp |journal=The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology |volume=80 |issue=1 |date=Spring 1989 |pages=114–176 |doi=10.2307/1143765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Henriksson, the anti-drug appeals of the Reagan administration "created an environment in which many employers felt compelled to implement drug testing programs because failure to do so might be perceived as condoning drug use. This fear was easily exploited by aggressive marketing and sales forces, who often overstated the value of testing and painted a bleak picture of the consequences of failing to use the drug testing product or service being offered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3551028 |title=The Unconvincing Case for Drug Testing |jstor=3551028 |author=Lennart E.

By 1987, nearly 25% of the [[Fortune 500]] companies used drug tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01016746 |title=A Critical Review of the Assumptions Underlying Drug Testing |author=Deborah F.

According to an uncontrolled self-report study done by DATIA and [[Society for Human Resource Management]] in 2012 (sample of 6,000 randomly selected human resource professionals), human resource professionals reported the following results after implementing a drug testing program: 19% of companies reported a subjective increase in employee productivity, 16% reported a decrease in employee turnover (8% reported an increase), and unspecified percentages reported decreases in absenteeism and improvement of workers' compensation incidence rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Employee Drug Testing Study|url=http://www.globaldrugpolicy.org/Issues/Vol%205%20Issue%204/Basic-11-22Efficacy%20Study%20Publication%20Final.pdf|publisher=Global Drug Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to US Chamber of Commerce 70% of all illicit drug users are employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EAP Employee and Supervisor Drug Education|url=http://www.usuhs.mil/chr/doc/EAPDrugFree.pdf|publisher=USUHS.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some industries have high rates of employee drug use such as construction (12.8%), repair (11.1%), and hospitality (7.9-16.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Substance Abuse in the hospitality industry|url=http://asbtdc.ualr.edu/drugfree/hospitly.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216184651/http://asbtdc.ualr.edu/drugfree/hospitly.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 16, 2009|publisher=Arkansas Small Business Development Center|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
A person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU—the new term that includes employers) has duties under the work health and safety (WHS) legislation to ensure a worker affected by alcohol or other drugs does not place themselves or other persons at risk of injury while at work. Workplace policies and prevention programs can help change the norms and culture around substance abuse.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

All organisations—large and small—can benefit from an agreed policy on alcohol and drug misuse that applies to all workers. Such a policy should form part of an organisations overall health and safety management system. PCBUs are encouraged to establish a policy and procedure, in consultation with workers, to constructively manage alcohol and other drug related hazards in their workplace.  A comprehensive workplace alcohol and other drug policy should apply to everyone in the workplace and include prevention, education, counselling and rehabilitation arrangements. In addition, the roles and responsibilities of managers and supervisors should be clearly outlined.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

All Australian workplace drug testing must comply with Australian standard AS/NZS4308:2008.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In Victoria, roadside saliva tests detect drugs that contain:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://adf.org.au/insights/roadside-drug-testing/|title=Roadside drug testing|last=|first=|date=|website=www.adf.org.au|publisher=Alcohol and Drug Foundation|accessdate=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* THC (Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol), the active component in cannabis.
* methamphetamine, also known as "ice", "crystal" and "crank".
* MDMA (Methylenedioxymethamphetamine), which is known as ecstasy.

In February 2016 a New South Wales magistrate "acquitted a man who tested positive for cannabis". He had been arrested and charged after testing positive during a roadside drug test, despite not having smoked for nine days. He was relying on advice previously given to him by police.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au2016-02-02-man-caught"&gt;{{cite web

==Refusal==
In the United States federal criminal system, refusing to take a drug test triggers an automatic revocation of probation or supervised release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Uscsub|18|3565|b|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Uscsub|18|3583|g|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Victoria, Australia the driver of the car has the option to refuse the drug test. Refusing to undergo a drug test or refusing to undergo a secondary drug test after the first one, triggers an automatic suspension and disqualification for a period of 2 years and a fine of AUD$1000. The second refusal triggers an automatic suspension and disqualification for a period of 4 years and an even larger fine.

===Historical cases===
* In 1993 Meritorious Marine Sergeant Steve Steinmetz refused to submit to further drug screening on the grounds that it violated his 4th and 5th Amendment Rights against unwarranted search and self-incrimination.  He was court-martialed and given a Bad Conduct Discharge from the United States Marine Corps in 1994 for refusing to obey a "lawful order".  He was threatened with forced medical procedures to obtain a sample if he was imprisoned.  Said Marine stated, "That won't happen".  He was discharged without being imprisoned.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* In 2000, an Australian Mining Company South Blackwater Coal Ltd with 400 employees, imposed drug-testing procedures, and the trade unions advised their members to refuse to take the tests, partly because a positive result does not necessarily indicate present impairment; the workers were stood-down by the company without pay for a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Case-Study.

The '''Edict of Châteaubriant''',&lt;ref&gt;Often ''Châteaubriand''; the modern spelling of the place is [[Châteaubriant]]; the château had been rebuilt magnificently by [[Jean de Laval-Châteaubriant|Jean de Laval]], baron de Châteaubriant, whose wife, [[Françoise de Foix]], had been a mistress of [[Francis I of France|François I]]; the baron had made a gift of it in 1539/40 to the ''connétable'' [[Anne de Montmorency]]. (Abbé Guillotin de Corson, "Châteaubriant, baronnie, ville et paroisse" in Abbé Goudé, ''Histoire politique et civile de Châteaubriant'' (1869), pt. I, ch. vi:[http://pinsonnais.free.fr/chateaubriant/?id=p1_s1_c6_2 On-line text], and following chapters&lt;/ref&gt; issued from the seat of [[Anne de Montmorency|Anne, duc de Montmorency]] in [[Brittany]], was promulgated by [[Henry II of France|Henri II of France]], 27 June 1551. The Edict was one of an increasingly severe series of measures taken by Henry II against [[Protestant]]s, whom he regarded as heretics. In the preamble, the Edict frankly reported that previous measures against [[heresy]] in the kingdom had proved ineffectual.&lt;ref&gt;The first punitive code, the [[Edict of Fontainebleau (1540)]], had been issued in 1540.&lt;/ref&gt; "Heretics", the Edict reported, met in [[conventicle]]s, infected schools, invaded the judicial bench and forced toleration upon judges. To ensure more rigorous judgements, in 1547 Henri had already created a special judicial chamber drawn from members of the ''[[parlement]]s'', solely to judge cases of heresy, (called by Protestants the ''Chambre Ardente'' (the "Burning Chamber").&lt;ref&gt;Linda L. Taber, "Religious Dissent within the Parlement of Paris in the Mid-Sixteenth Century: A Reassessment" ''French Historical Studies'' '''16'''.3 (Spring 1990:684-699) p 685.&lt;/ref&gt; The Edict contained quite detailed provisions: it called upon the civil and [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] courts to detect and punish all heretics, and placed severe restrictions on Protestants, including loss of one-third of property granted to informers, who were also granted immunity&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Mentzer, Jr., "The Legal Response to Heresy in Languedoc, 1500-1560" ''Sixteenth Century Journal'' '''4'''.1 (April 1973:19-30) p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and confiscations of property both moveable and immovable belonging to those who had fled to [[Geneva]], with whom the king's subjects were forbidden to correspond or to send money.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Edict of Compiègne]], of 1557, made travelling to Geneva an act punishable by death (Mentzer 1973:24.)&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen of its forty-six articles were concerned with [[censorship]]; its terms strictly [[Freedom of the press|regulated the press]] by prohibiting the sale, importation or printing of any book unapproved by the Faculty of Theology at the [[University of Paris]], then or, now it was implied,&lt;ref&gt;By a future tense in the wording (Francis M. Higman, ''Censorship and the Sorbonne'' [Geneva: Broz] 1979:65).&lt;/ref&gt; in the future.&lt;ref&gt;James K. Farge, ''Orthodoxy and Reform in Early Reformation France: The Faculty of Theology of Paris, 1500-1543'' (Leiden: Brill) 1985:218.&lt;/ref&gt; Booksellers were to display a copy of the Faculty's printed list of prohibited books alongside a list of books for sale. Delegates of the Faculty were to make visits twice a year to each bookseller to ensure that the provisions were complied with. Since 1542 it had been a requirement that any shipment of books into France be opened and unpacked in the presence of delegates from the Faculty of Theology, which now, according to Roger Doucet,&lt;ref&gt;''The Rabelais encyclopedia'' by Elizabeth A.

Though the Edict went so far as to forbid the discussion of religious topics at work, in the fields, or over meals, it proved insufficient to stem the rising tide of reform in religion. Sterner measures would be taken in the next edict of the series, the [[Edict of Compiègne]], 1557, which applied the death penalty for all convictions of heresy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17561">An '''entrenched clause''' or '''entrenchment clause''' of a [[basic law]] or [[constitution]] is a provision that makes certain amendments either more difficult or impossible to pass, making such amendments inadmissible. Overriding an entrenched clause may require a [[supermajority]], a [[referendum]], or the consent of the minority party.

Once adopted, a properly drafted entrenchment clause makes some portion of a basic law or constitution irrevocable except through the assertion of the [[right of revolution]].

Any amendment to a basic law or constitution which would not satisfy the prerequisites enshrined in a valid entrenched clause would lead to so-called "unconstitutional constitutional law", that is, an amendment to constitutional law text that would appear to be constitutional law by its form, albeit unconstitutional due to the procedure used to enact it or due to the content of its provisions.

Entrenched clauses are, in some cases, justified as protecting the rights of a minority from the dangers of [[majoritarianism]]. In other cases, the objective may be to prevent amendments to the basic law or constitution which would pervert the fundamental principles enshrined in it. However, entrenched clauses are often challenged by their opponents as being undemocratic.

[[Eternity clause]]s are a type of entrenched clause.

==Australia==

As Australian Parliaments have inherited the British principle of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], they may not entrench themselves by a regular act. Therefore, the entrenchment of the national flag in the ''Flags Act'' of 1953 is without force as the entrenchment clause could be removed (through normal legislative amendment) by later parliaments.&lt;ref&gt;Speech by the Hon. David Jull, MP – Minister for Administrative Services 2001 [http://www.samuelgriffith.org.au/papers/html/volume7/v7chap3.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Australia|Commonwealth Constitution]] is entrenched as it may only be amended by referendum; the amendment must gain the support of a majority of Australian voters nationwide, plus a majority of voters in a majority of states. These provisions are specified in [[Chapter VIII of the Australian Constitution|section 128]]. The Imperial Parliament's power to amend it in Australian law was limited by the [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942|''Statute of Westminster Adoption Act'' 1942]] and terminated by the [[Australia Act|''Australia Act'' 1986]].

State laws respecting the constitution, powers or procedure of the parliament of a state need to follow any restrictions specified in state law on such acts, by virtue of section 6 of the ''Australia Act''. This power does not extend to the whole constitution of the state, and the Parliament of Queensland has ignored entrenchments in amending its constitution.&lt;ref name="twomey"&gt;Anne Twomey. [http://www.gtcentre.unsw.edu.au/sites/gtcentre.unsw.edu.au/files/mdocs/5_AnneTwomey.pdf Manner and Form]&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, it is possible that the entrenchment clauses are unentrenchable, preventing state law from having effectively entrenching clauses.&lt;ref name="twomey"/&gt;

==Brazil==
Entrenched clauses of the [[Constitution of Brazil]] are listed in Article 60, Paragraph 4:

{{quote|No proposal of amendment shall be considered which is aimed at abolishing:&lt;br/&gt;
I – the federative form of State;&lt;br/&gt;
II – the direct, secret, universal and periodic vote;&lt;br/&gt;
III – the separation of the Government Powers;&lt;br/&gt;
IV – individual rights and guarantees.
}}

==Bosnia and Herzegovina==

Article X of the [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], defining the amendment procedure, provides in paragraph 2 that the rights and freedoms as established in Article II of the Constitution may not be eliminated or diminished, and that the paragraph 2 itself may not be altered.

==Czech Republic==
Article 9 of the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Czech Constitution]], which concerns [[Amendments|supplementing and amending]] the Constitution, states that "the substantive requisites of the democratic, law-abiding State may not be amended." This provision was invoked in 2009 when the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic]] abolished a [[Constitutional act of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Act]] adopted to invoke one off early legislative election. The disputed act was seen as an individual decision in violation of then-effective constitutional procedure regulating early elections.

==France==
The [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]] states in Title XVI, Article 89, On [[Amendments]] to the Constitution, "The [[republic]]an form of government shall not be the object of any amendment" thus forbidding the restoration of the [[monarchy]] or the [[empire]].

==Germany==
The [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] (''Grundgesetz'') provides in its [[eternity clause]] (Article&amp;nbsp;79 section&amp;nbsp;3) that any amendment would be "inadmissible" if such amendment would provide that the Federal Republic would not consist of states (''Länder'') any more, that the states would no longer be entitled to participate in the federal law-making procedures, or if "the basic principles" of Articles 1 and 20 would be affected. "The basic principles" are as follows:

* '''Duty of all state authority''': "The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority." (Article 1)
* '''Acknowledgement of human rights''': "The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human rights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world." (Article 1 Paragraph 2)
* '''Directly enforceable law''': "The following basic rights bind the legislature, the executive and judiciary as directly enforceable law." (Article 1 Paragraph 3)
* '''Republic''' (form of government): (Article 20 Paragraph 1)
* '''Federal state''' ''(Länder)'': (Article 20 Paragraph 1)
* '''Social state''' (welfare state): (Article 20 Paragraph 1)
* '''Sovereignty of the People''': "All state authority emanates from the People." (Article 20 Paragraph 2)
* '''Democratic''': "All state authority is exercised by the people by means of elections and voting and by specific legislative, executive and judicial organs." (Article 20 Paragraph 2)
* '''Rule of law''' ''(Rechtsstaat)'': "Legislation is subject to the constitutional order. The executive and judiciary are bound by the law." (Article 20 Paragraph 3)
* '''Separation of powers''': "Specific legislative, executive and judicial organs," each "bound by the law." (Article 20 Paragraphs 2–3)

The original purpose of this eternity clause was to ensure that the establishment of any [[dictatorship]] in Germany would be clearly illegal; in legal practice the clause was used by plaintiffs at the Federal Constitutional Court challenging constitutional amendments that affected Articles 1, 10, 19, 101, and 103 regarding restrictions of legal recourse.  Although these basic principles are protected from being repealed, their particular expression may still be amended; such as to clarify, extend or refine an entrenched principle.

==Honduras==
The [[Constitution of Honduras]] has an article stating that the article itself and certain other articles cannot be changed in any circumstances. Article 374 of the Honduras Constitution asserts this unmodifiability, stating, "It is not possible to reform, in any case, the preceding article, the present article, the constitutional articles referring to the form of government, to the national territory, to the presidential period, the prohibition to serve again as President of the Republic, the citizen who has performed under any title in consequence of which she/he cannot be President of the Republic in the subsequent period."&lt;ref name="georgetown_const_82-05_art374"&gt;{{citation | title= Republic of Honduras: Political Constitution of 1982 through 2005 reforms; Article 374 | publisher= [[Georgetown University]] | work= Political Database of the Americas | url= http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Honduras/hond05.html | language= Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; This unmodifiable article has played an important role in the [[2009 Honduran constitutional crisis]].

==Indonesia==
The Article 37 on the Chapter 16 of the [[Constitution of Indonesia]] manages constitutional amendment procedure, yet it also specifies that the [[unitary state]] status of [[Indonesia]] is unmodifiable.

==Ireland==
There are several examples of entrenched clauses which ultimately failed in their objectives, since their protections were undermined in unintended ways. The [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] was required in parts to be consistent with the 1922 [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], including the [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]] and the [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]]. The checks to protect this were removed by, for example, the Irish taking control of advice to the Governor-General, and when the [[Seanad Éireann (Irish Free State)|Senate]] proved obstructive, its abolition.

==Italy==
Article 139 of the [[Constitution of Italy]], promulgated in 1947, provides that the republican form of government shall not be a matter for constitutional amendment.

==Malaysia==
Another example of entrenchment would be the entrenching of portions of the [[Malaysian Constitution]] related to the [[Social contract (Malaysia)|Malaysian social contract]], which specifies that citizenship be granted to the substantial [[Chinese Malaysian|Chinese]] and [[Indian Malaysian|Indian]] immigrant populations in return for the recognition of a special position for the indigenous [[Malay people|Malay]] majority. The Constitution did not initially contain an entrenched clause; indeed, one of the articles later entrenched, [[Article 153]], was initially intended to be subject to a [[sunset clause]]. However, after the [[May 13 incident]] of racial rioting in 1969, [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]] passed the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1971. The Act permitted criminalisation of the questioning of Articles 152, 153, 181, and Part III of the Constitution.

Article 152 designates the [[Malay language]] as the national language of Malaysia; Article 153 grants the Malays special privileges; Article 181 covers the position of the [[Malay rulers]]; and Part III deals with matters of citizenship. The restrictions, which even covered Members of Parliament, made the repeal of these sections of the Constitution unamendable or repealable by ''de facto''; however, to entrench them further, the Act also amended Article 159(5), which covers Constitutional amendments, to prohibit the amending of the aforementioned Articles, as well as Article 159(5), without the consent of the [[Conference of Rulers]] &amp;mdash; a non-elected body comprising the rulers of the [[Malay states]] and the governors of the other states.&lt;ref&gt;Khoo, Boo Teik (1995). ''Paradoxes of Mahathirism'', pp. 104&amp;ndash;106. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|967-65-3094-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morocco==
In the [[Constitution of Morocco]], eternity clauses exist that ensure certain provisions cannot be amended, including the role of [[Islam]] in the nation's law, and the role of the [[List of rulers of Morocco|King of Morocco]] in law.&lt;ref name=EWC&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Constitutions|author=Gerhard Robbers|isbn=978-0816060788|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3A-xgf1yM4C&amp;pg=PA626&amp;lpg=PA626&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YdnxLlYGpo&amp;sig=6JeZzSC2H1Ms2nzztB6w7F1N7H8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CLNJULKMOYXL0AWJ6YHICw|year=2006|page=626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
Section 268 of the Electoral Act (part of the [[Constitution of New Zealand]]) declares that the law governing the maximum term of Parliament, along with certain provisions of the Electoral Act relating to the [[Redistribution (election)|redistribution]] of electoral boundaries, the voting age, and the [[secret ballot]], may only be altered either by three-quarters of the entire membership of the House of Representatives, or by a majority of valid votes in a popular [[referendum]]. Section 268 itself is not protected by this provision, so a government could legally repeal Section 268 and go on to alter the entrenched portions of law, both with a mere [[majority|simple majority]] in Parliament.

==South Africa==
Another example of a failed entrenched clause was in the [[South Africa Act]], the initial constitution of the [[Union of South Africa]]. The constitution's entrenched clauses protected [[suffrage|voting rights]] in the [[Cape Province]], including those of some [[Coloured]]s, but they lost their votes after the Government restructured the Senate and packed it with its sympathisers so that they were able to achieve the required supermajority in what is known as the [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis]].

==Turkey==
Article 4 of Part 1 of the [[Constitution of Turkey]] states that the "provision of Article 1 of the Constitution establishing the form of the state as a Republic, the provisions in Article 2 on the characteristics of the Republic, and the provision of Article 3 shall not be amended, nor shall their amendment be proposed."

==United Kingdom==
{{expandsect|date=October 2016}}
The doctrine of [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|parliamentary supremacy]] holds that Parliament may pass any law it wishes, including that it can't be limited by previous laws.

Notions of entrenchment have emerged in consideration of a number of constitutional statutes, including the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]]. (See ''[[Jackson v A-G]]'' [2005].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Young |first=Alison L. |year=2006 |title=Hunting Sovereignty: Jackson v Her Majesty's Attorney-General |journal=[[Public Law (journal)|Public Law]] |volume=2006 |issue=2 |pages=187–196 |publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell |issn=0033-3565 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

[[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]] of the [[United States Constitution]] temporarily shielded certain clauses in Article I from being amended. The [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Slave trade|first]] clause in Section 9, which prevented Congress from passing any law that would restrict the importation of [[History of slavery|slaves]] prior to 1808, and the [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Apportionment of direct taxes|fourth]] clause in that same section, a declaration that [[direct tax#U.S. constitutional law sense|direct taxes]] must be apportioned according to the state populations, were explicitly shielded from Constitutional amendment prior to 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spaulding|first1=Matthew|title=Essays on Article V: Prohibition on Amendment: Slave Trade|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/5/essays/130/prohibition-on-amendment-slave-trade|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Article V also shields the [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 1: Composition.3B Election of Senators|first]] clause of Article I, Section 3, which provides for equal representation of the states in the [[United States Senate]], from being amended, though not absolutely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rossum|first1=Ralph  Rossum|title=Essays on Article V: Prohibition on Amendment: Equal Suffrage in the Senate|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/5/essays/131/prohibition-on-amendment-equal-suffrage-in-the-senate|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been interpreted to require unanimous ratification of any amendment altering the composition of the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;Chico State Inside: [http://www.csuchico.edu/pub/inside/06_11_09/gibson.shtml Alan Gibson, "It Is Broken, but No One Wants to Fix It: A Call for Reform of the United States Constitution"], accessed July 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, the text of the clause would indicate that the size of the Senate could be changed by an ordinary amendment if each state continued to have equal representation.

==Company law==
Provisions may also be entrenched in the constitutions of corporate bodies. An example is in the memoranda and articles of a [[company limited by guarantee]], in which the principles of [[common ownership]] may be entrenched. This practice can make it almost impossible for the company's members to dissolve the company and distribute its assets amongst them. This idea has more recently been extended in the UK through the invention of the [[community interest company]] (CIC) which incorporates an [[asset lock]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004]], part 2&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies in the UK may make provision for entrenchment of certain articles so that, for example, the specified articles may only be amended or repealed by agreement of all the members of the company or by a court order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Companies Act 2006]], section 22&lt;/ref&gt; In India there is similar provision in section 5 of the [[Companies Act 2013]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.corporate-cases.com/2013/04/provisions-of-entrenchment-in-articles.html Provisions for Entrenchment in Articles of Association], accessed 20 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11959">'''False accusations''' (or '''groundless accusations''' or '''unfounded accusations''' or '''false allegations''' or '''false claims''') can be in any of the following contexts:
* Informally in everyday life. 
* [[Quasi-judicial]]ly
* [[Judicial]]ly.

==Types==
When there is insufficient supporting evidence to determine whether an accusation is true or false, it is described as "unsubstantiated" or "unfounded". Accusations that are determined to be false based on corroborating evidence can be divided into three categories:&lt;ref name="Ney"/&gt;
* An allegation that is completely false, in that the events that were alleged did not occur.
* An allegation that describes events that did occur, but were perpetrated by an individual who is not accused, and in which the accused person is innocent.
* An allegation that is false, in that it mixes descriptions of events that actually happened with other events that did not occur.

A false allegation can occur as the result of [[Lie|intentional lying]] on the part of the accuser;&lt;ref name="mikkel"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mikkelsen EJ, Gutheil TG, Emens M |title=False sexual-abuse allegations by children and adolescents: contextual factors and clinical subtypes |journal=Am J Psychother |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=556–70 |date=October 1992 |pmid=1443285 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant"&gt;Clifton D. Bryant, ''Deviant Behavior: Readings in the Sociology of Norm Violation'' (1990), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; or unintentionally, due to a [[confabulation]], either arising spontaneously due to [[mental illness]]&lt;ref name="mikkel"/&gt; or resulting from deliberate or accidental suggestive questioning, or faulty interviewing techniques.&lt;ref name="Ceci"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Maggie Bruck |author2=Ceci, Stephen J |title=Jeopardy in the Courtroom |publisher=Amer Psychological Assn |location= |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=1-55798-282-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers Poole and Lindsay suggested in 1997 applying separate labels to the two concepts, proposing the term "false allegations" be used specifically when the accuser is aware they are lying, and "false suspicions" for the wider range of false accusations in which suggestive questioning may have been involved.&lt;ref name="weiner438"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Psychology |author=[[Irving B. Weiner]] |author2=Donald K. Freedheim |year= 2003 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=lBXf1slZBDwC&amp;pg=PA438#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 438] | publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn= 0-471-17669-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a person is suspected of a wrongdoing for which they are in fact responsible, "false accusation may be used to divert attention from one's own guilt".&lt;ref name="Bryant"/&gt; False accusation may also arise in part from the conduct of the accused, particularly where the accused engages in behaviors consistent with having committed the suspected wrongdoing, either unconsciously or for purposes of appearing guilty.&lt;ref name="Bryant"/&gt; 

Additionally, once a false accusation has been made – particularly an emotionally laden one – normal human emotional responses to being falsely accused (such as fear, anger, or denial of the accusation) may be misinterpreted as evidence of guilt.

==Rape==
{{Main article|False accusation of rape}}
A false accusation of [[rape]] is the intentional reporting of a rape where no rape has occurred. It is difficult to assess the prevalence of false accusations because they are often conflated with non-prosecuted cases under the designation "unfounded."&lt;ref name="practical"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iV398oA5DdsC |title=Practical Aspects of Rape Investigation |year=2008 |editor-first=Robert R. |editor-last=Hazelwood |editor2-first=Ann Wolbert |editor2-last=Burgess |publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAOJ"&gt;Gross, Bruce (Spring 2009).

==Child abuse==
{{Main article|False accusations of child sexual abuse}}
A false allegation of child sexual abuse is an accusation that a person committed one or more acts of [[child sexual abuse]] when in reality there was no perpetration of abuse by the accused person as alleged. Such accusations can be brought by the victim, or by another person on the alleged victim's behalf. Studies of child abuse allegations suggest that the overall rate of false accusation is under 10%, as approximated based on multiple studies.&lt;ref name="Ney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hobbs197"&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Abuse and Neglect: A Clinician's Handbook |last= Hobbs |first= CJ |author2=Hanks HGI |author3=Wynne JM  |publisher= [[Elsevier|Elsevier Health Sciences]] |year=1999 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=3w_j-n1tLGcC&amp;pg=PA197#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 197] |isbn= 0-443-05896-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schetky105"&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Sexual Abuse: A Handbook for Health Care and Legal Professionals |last= Schetky |first=DH |author2=Green AH |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1988 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=QYyzGgZbllYC&amp;pg=PA105#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 105] |isbn= 0-87630-495-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolen109"&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Sexual Abuse: Its Scope and Our Failure |last= Bolen |first=RM |publisher=Springer |year= 2001 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bzd1ytm7nvoC&amp;pg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 109] |isbn= 0-306-46576-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the allegations determined to be false, only a small portion originated with the child, the studies showed; most false allegations originated with an adult bringing the accusations on behalf of a child, and of those, a large majority occurred in the context of [[divorce]] and child-custody battles.&lt;ref name="Ney"&gt;{{cite book|title=True and False Allegations of Child Sexual Abuse: Assessment and Case Management |last=Ney |first=T |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1995 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=BggJjhbBJzwC&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 23–33] |isbn= 0-87630-758-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robin21"&gt;{{cite book|title=Assessing Child Maltreatment Reports: The Problem of False Allegations |last= Robin |first=M |publisher= [[Haworth Press]] |year= 1991 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tqBVMUlMPLIC&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 21–24] |isbn= 0-86656-931-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace bullying==

Research by the Workplace Bullying Institute, suggests that "falsely accused someone of 'errors' not actually made" is the most common of all bullying tactics experienced, in 71 percent of cases.&lt;ref name=namie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workplacebullying.org/top-25/|title=Top 25 workplace bullying tactics|publisher=|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workplace mobbing can be considered as a "virus" or a "cancer" that spreads throughout the workplace via [[gossip]], [[rumour]] and unfounded accusations.&lt;ref&gt;Shallcross, L, Ramsay, S, &amp; Barker M, (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confessionpost.com/22070/i-falsely-accused-my-director)|title=I falsely accused my director|website=www.confessionpost.com|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Münchausen syndrome by proxy==
{{Main article|Münchausen syndrome by proxy}}
The case has been made that diagnoses of Münchausen syndrome by proxy, that is harming someone else in order to gain attention for oneself, are often false or highly questionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnc.com.au/~heleneli/paper.htm|title=False Accusations of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy.

==Stalking==
{{Main article|False claims of stalking, gang stalking and delusions of persecution}}
In 1999, Pathe, Mullen and Purcell wrote that popular interest in [[stalking]] was promoting false claims.&lt;ref&gt;M Pathe, PE Mullen, R Purcell; Stalking: false claims of victimisation; British Journal of Psychiatry 174: 170-172 (1999)[http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/174/2/170]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Sheridan and Blaauw said that they estimated that 11.5% of claims in a sample of 357 reported claims of stalking were false.&lt;ref name="Sheridan and Blauuw 2004"&gt;L.

==Narcissistic rage==
{{Main article|Narcissistic rage}}
Rage by a [[narcissist]] is directed towards the person that they feel has slighted them. This rage [[Cognitive distortion|impairs their cognition]], therefore impairing their [[judgment]]. During the rage, they are prone to shouting, fact distortion and making groundless accusations.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas D Narcissism: Behind the Mask (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological projection==
{{Main article|Psychological projection}}
Psychological projection can be established as a means of obtaining or justifying certain actions that would normally be found atrocious or heinous. This often means projecting false accusations, information, etc., onto an individual for the sole purpose of maintaining a self-created illusion.&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge 2006) p. 115 and p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Feature Group''', in North American telephone industry jargon, is most commonly used to designate various standard means of access by callers to competitive [[long distance calling|long distance]] services.  
They defined switching arrangements from [[local exchange carrier]]s central offices to [[interexchange carrier]]s. These arrangements were described in an official tariff{{specify|date=January 2011}} of the [[National Exchange Carrier Association]], filed with the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).{{when|date=January 2011}}

While there are other feature groups for local access,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuffsoftware.com/features.html Complete List of NECA standard Feature Codes]&lt;/ref&gt; the four common feature groups exist for access from the local subscriber to competitive [[interexchange carrier|long-distance carriers]]:
; Feature Group A: The original implementation, in which a user has to dial the local [[telephone number]] of a provider's gateway, followed by (usually) a password, then the desired long-distance number. There is a different local access number in each local calling area. This requires no special capability at the local telephone company office as competing long distance providers connected using standard local lines, which may or may not support [[caller ID]]. If a carrier has no local presence, a [[foreign exchange service (telecommunications)|foreign exchange]] line is used to reach its nearest point of presence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wholesale.att.com/products_and_services/access/transport/SWA_FGA.html Feature group 'A'], AT&amp;T/SBC&lt;/ref&gt; Once the standard means of accessing alternate long-distance carriers, local access numbers are now used primarily for low-cost prepaid calling cards as the calls may be made from any phone, at flat or local rates.
; Feature Group B: Associated with 950-XXXX calling; instead of a local telephone number the user enters 950 and 4 additional digits which identify the long distance carrier. Operation is similar to the local access numbers (feature group A) except that the 950-XXXX access number is the same in every community, [[North American Numbering Plan|NANP-wide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wholesale.att.com/products_and_services/access/transport/SWA_FGB.html Feature group 'B'], AT&amp;T/SBC&lt;/ref&gt; Some exchanges send [[automatic number identification|the caller's number]] automatically; where this service is not provided or not desired (calling card applications), the 950-XXXX number must be followed by a calling card number and the long-distance destination number. If ANI is provided, calls from the one subscribed line may be made as 950-XXXX and the long-distance destination. Largely deprecated by feature group D, but the 950 prefix and a list of carrier codes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanpa.com/enas/formCICBMasterReport.do NANPA list of feature group 'B' carrier codes]&lt;/ref&gt; remain reserved in all North American area codes, even in Canada where most providers went from feature group A directly to 1+ default carrier dialling and feature group D (101xxxx + destination) calling without ever using 950-XXXX as a primary means to access alternate long distance carriers from home land lines.
; Feature Group C: Rare, originally used by AT&amp;T for operator-assisted coin phones since they allow the operator to keep control of the caller's telephone line until the transaction is completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phworld.org/payphone/acts.htm Telephone World - AT&amp;T Automated Coin Toll System]&lt;/ref&gt; As coin-handling for trunk calls is now automated within the phone (like a [[COCOT]], the current generation of coin phones operates self-contained without the central exchange providing coin-call support functions), group 'C' is largely obsolete.
; Feature Group D: The current standard, requires the local switch support equal access by competing carriers at the trunk level; highest quality connection, and allows pre-selection of the [[interexchange carrier]] by the end-user.  This feature group permits two types of calls.  If a user dials 1 + [[area code]] + seven-digit number, the long distance call is handled by a default carrier chosen by the user.  Alternatively, a user dials 101 + four-digit carrier code + area code + seven-digit number, and the call is handled by the carrier specified by the carrier code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wholesale.att.com/products_and_services/access/transport/SWA_FGD.html Feature group 'D'], AT&amp;T/SBC&lt;/ref&gt; The original batch of carrier codes began with 0, so this type of "dial around" service was typically marketed as dial-around 1010-xxx service. NANPA maintains separate lists of carrier codes for feature groups 'B' and 'D'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanpa.com/enas/formCICDMasterReport.do NANPA list of feature group 'D' carrier codes]&lt;/ref&gt; as not all long distance providers support both standards.

These Feature Group alternatives allowed the LEC's end users to make [[long-distance calling|long distance calls]] using the interexchange carrier's network, when non-stored program-controlled exchanges could not be modified to provide equal access. By the mid 1990s, Equal Access features in exchange software had rendered Feature Group D universally available in modern landline exchanges; the others are either used for calling card applications or are obsolete.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8220">At 6:00 am ([[Amsterdam Time]]) on 10 May 1940, during the [[Battle of the Netherlands]], the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[envoy (title)|envoy]] Count [[Count Julius von Zech-Burkersroda|von Zech-Burkersroda]] gave the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Eelco Nicolaas van Kleffens|Van Kleffens]] a message. It was not an actual declaration of war. The message was later interpreted by the Dutch as a declaration of war; however from the German side it was at the time seen as a mere warning, hopefully intimidating the Dutch enough to accept German military protection. At this moment the German troops had already transgressed the Dutch border.

==The delivery==
In the early hours of 10 May the German minister of foreign affairs [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] ordered the German envoy in the Netherlands, [[Count Julius von Zech-Burkersroda]], who had been living in the Netherlands for many years representing the German government, to deliver a message to the Dutch government. Around 04:00 local time the Dutch minister of foreign affairs Eelco van Kleffens was recalled from the Dutch war council to his department in order to receive the message. It was not easy for Van Kleffens to reach the building as [[The Hague]] was already under attack by German [[Fallschirmjäger|paratroopers]] and nervous Dutch soldiers manning checkpoints suspected anyone to be a [[fifth column]]ist. He was even arrested and released only on orders of the General Headquarters.

On arrival Van Kleffens received the envoy around 6:00 in his office, who entered, guarded by two Dutch officers, in tears. He had with him a transcription in German of the telegram. He should have reformulated it, but had been unable to, apparently having been overcome by his emotions, feeling deeply ashamed of the actions by his fellow countrymen. When facing Van Kleffens he was unable to speak but merely cried; after a while Van Kleffens asked him to hand over the paper so that he could read it himself.

It was directly apparent to Van Kleffens that the message entailed an offer to become a German [[protectorate]] (like [[Denmark]] had done a month earlier) under threat of complete annihilation of the Dutch state if the Dutch would refuse to comply. It would have to be made clear immediately that the Netherlands intended to continue the fight together with their allies; however, by the [[Constitution of the Netherlands|Dutch Constitution]] for a Dutch declaration of war, consent was needed of the [[States-General of the Netherlands]]. Therefore, he chose to answer that the Dutch government considered the Kingdom of the Netherlands to be already in a state of war with Germany as a result of the German military action. He answered by writing a reply with a blue [[aniline]] pencil on a small paper.

Many Dutch sources treat the telegram text as if it were a German declaration of war and change the typical style into standard sentences.

==In English==
===The telegram===
{{quote|Announcement of deployment of enormous German military force.

Any resistance completely futile''

Germany guarantees European and extra-European possessions and the dynasty, if any resistance remains absent. Else danger of complete annihilation of the country and the form of government.

Therefore demand urgently appeal people and forces and demand establish contact with German military commanders

Motivation: we have irrefutable proof of an imminent threat of invasion by France and England in Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, which has long been prepared with the joint knowledge of the Netherlands and Belgium. Purpose: advance to Ruhr area}}

===Telegram changed into a German declaration===
{{quote|We announce to you the deployment of an enormous German military force. Any resistance is perfectly futile. Germany guarantees the territorial integrity in Europe and Overseas, as well as the dynasty, if any resistance remains absent. If not, then a danger exists of complete annihilation of the country and its form of government. Therefore we admonish you urgently to make an appeal to the people and the military forces and furthermore to establish a line of communication with the German military commanders.

Motivation: We have irrefutable proof of an imminent threat of invasion by France and England in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, which had long been prepared with the joint knowledge of the Netherlands and Belgium, with the purpose of attacking the Ruhr area.}}

===Dutch reply===

{{quote|With indignation Her Majesty's Government rejects the allegation by the German Government, that it, in any way, or with any other Power, has made secret agreements directed against Germany. In view of the outrageous German attack on the Netherlands, an attack initiated without any prior warning, it is the judgement of the Dutch Government that presently a state of war has come to exist between the Kingdom and Germany.}}

{{otheruses|Guarantee (disambiguation)}}
'''Guarantee''' – a method to ensure the fulfilment of international obligations, when a [[Sovereign state|state]] promises to help the other state to fulfil its obligations, when some third party hinders that.&lt;ref name="ЭСБЕ_Гарантия_международная"&gt;"Энциклопедический словарь Брокгауза и Ефрона", St. Petersburg, 1890—1907, VIII vol., 113—114 p., „Гарантия международная“, [[:s:ru:ЭСБЕ/Гарантия_международная]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously other methods to ensure fulfilment of international obligations, like [[oath|oaths]] or receiving [[hostage|hostages]], were also called guarantees.&lt;ref name="ЭСБЕ_Гарантия_международная"/&gt;

One example of such an obligation can be [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].&lt;ref name="ЭСБЕ_Гарантия_международная"/&gt; For example, before [[World War I]] neutrality of [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]] had been guaranteed.&lt;ref name="ЭСБЕ_Гарантия_международная"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2777">'''Don Gutierre de Hevia y Valdés''' (died December 2, 1772) was a Spanish military man, who was head of the Spanish Marine Corps and present when Spain lost Havana during the [[British expedition against Cuba]].

==Biography==
Born at [[Tortona]], [[Italy]], he joined the Spanish Navy in 1720. In [[Cadiz]], he was involved in a duel and killed his opponent. He was trialed but acquitted, and left for the Americas. He made career in the [[Infantería de Marina|Spanish Marine Corps]] and was the third man to set foot on enemy territory during the expedition to [[Oran]] in 1732.

In 1740, he served in the [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias|successful defense of Cartagena]] under general [[Blas de Lezo]] against a British invasion force under Admiral [[Edward Vernon]], and was wounded.

In 1747 he received his first command of the warship ''Nueva España''. In 1759 he commanded the [[Spanish ship Fenix (1749)|''Fenix'']] that was part of the convoy that brought [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]], the new King of Spain, from Naples to Spain. For this, he received the titles of ''Marqués del Real Transporte and Vizconde del Buen Viaje'', and became Squadron leader.

In 1761, he was sent to Havana with a fleet of 12 ships to defend the city against an expected attack by the British, as Spain had entered the [[Seven Years' War]] that year, on the side of France.

On June 6, 1762, a powerful English invasion force under [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle]] began the siege of Havana. The fleet of Hevia played no part in the battle, all the guns and men were disembarked and used to defend the forts. The city was finally taken on 13 August. Hevia neglected to burn his fleet, which fell intact in the hands of the British.

Hevia and the surviving Spanish troops were transported to Spain. On his arrival, the Madrid government caused him to be tried by a court-martial. He was stripped of his titles and condemned to house arrest for 10 years. Thanks to the influence of his father-in-law don [[Juan José Navarro]], Marqués de la Victoria, he was pardoned on September 17, 1765 on the occasion of the wedding of [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles, the Prince of Asturia]].

He was reinstated as head of the Marine Corps and was based in Cadiz. He died in 1772 at [[Isla de León]].

{{Politics of the Isle of Man}}

The '''High Bailiff''' ({{lang-gv|Ard-Vaylee}}) is a legal position held within the [[Isle of Man]]. The High Bailiff is the head stipendiary [[magistrate]].

==Isle of Man==

The current High Bailiff is His Worship John Needham, who took office on 30 January 2010 on the retirement of Mr [[Michael Moyle]]. Mr Needham was previously Clerk to the Justices.  The current Deputy High Bailiff is Her Worship [[Jayne Hughes]].

The High Bailiff and his deputy are appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. The High Bailiff and Deputy High Bailiff are ex officio Judicial Officers of the [[High Court of Justice of the Isle of Man]]&lt;ref&gt;High Court Act 1991 s.3C&lt;/ref&gt; and Coroners of Inquests.&lt;ref&gt;[[Coroner]]s of Inquests Act 1987 s.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally there was a High Bailiff of each of the four towns of the Island, Castletown, Ramsey, Peel and Douglas.  In 1911 the offices of High Bailiff of Castletown and Douglas, and the offices of High Bailiff of Peel and Ramsey, were merged.  Those offices were merged in turn in 1933 to form a single office of High Bailiff of the Isle of Man.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2274">The '''Howard W. Hunter Law Library''' is the library of the [[J. Reuben Clark Law School]] at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU), [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], Utah.  It was named for [[Howard W. Hunter]], the 14th President of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] who had been a lawyer in the Los Angeles area before he was called as a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve]].

The Hunter Law Library has only had its current name since 1995.  However the library dates back 1975.  It was renamed at the time of its expansion in 1995, which was also only a short time after Hunter's death.  Hunter had been an early advocate of the founding of the BYU law school as a member of the BYU Board of Trustees and had also been closely connected with recruiting [[Rex E. Lee]] to be the first dean.

The library was expanded largely through a donation from [[Jon M. Huntsman, Sr.]] who had been Hunter's [[Stake (LDS Church)|stake]] president and a good friend and wanted to honor him by having the library named for him.

The Hunter Law Library has over 450,000 volume and volume equivalents and over 4,000 active serial subscriptions.  The current director is Kory D. Staheli, who has held this position since 2005 when he replaced Constance Lundburg.

The library is located in the same building as the Clark Law School, but it has clear internal entrances which are the security points beyond which books that have not been checked out may not go.  Although geared towards the needs of law school students any BYU student may check out materials from the law library or access [[LexisNexis]] through the libraries system.

{{Wiktionary}}

In [[telecommunication]]s, '''interconnection''' is the physical linking of a [[common carrier|carrier]]'s [[telecommunications network|network]] with equipment or facilities not belonging to that network.  The term may refer to a connection between a carrier's facilities and the equipment belonging to its customer, or to a connection between two (or more) carriers.

In [[United States]] regulatory [[law]], interconnection is specifically defined (47 [[Code of Federal Regulations|C.F.R.]] 51.5) as "the linking of two or more networks for the mutual exchange of traffic."

One of the primary tools used by regulators to introduce competition in telecommunications markets has been to impose interconnection requirements on dominant carriers.

==History==
===United States===
Under the [[Bell System]] monopoly (post [[Communications Act of 1934]]), the Bell System owned the phones and did not allow interconnection, either of separate phones (or other [[terminal equipment]]) or of other networks; a popular saying was "Ma Bell has you by the calls".

This began to change in the landmark case [[Hush-A-Phone v. United States]] [1956], which allowed some non-Bell owned equipment to be connected to the network, and was followed by a number of other cases, regulatory decisions, and legislation that led to the transformation of the American [[long distance calling|long distance]] [[telephone]] industry from a [[monopoly]] to a competitive business.

This further changed in [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]'s ''[[Carterfone]]'' decision in 1968, which required the Bell System companies to permit interconnection by radio-telephone operators.

Today the standard electrical connector for interconnection in the US, and much of the world, is the [[registered jack]] family of standards, especially [[RJ11]]. This was introduced by the Bell System in the 1970s, following a 1976 FCC order. Since then, it has gained popularity worldwide, and is [[De facto standard|a de facto international standard]].

===Europe===
Outside of the U.S., Interconnection or "Interconnect regimes" also take into account the associated commercial arrangements. As an example of the use of commercial arrangements, the focus by the EU has been on "encouraging" incumbents to offer bundles of network features that will enable competitors to provide services that compete directly with the incumbent. Further the interconnect regime decided upon by the regulator has a major impact on the development/rate of growth of market segments. According to Source8 (an EU based consultancy) two examples from the UK of this are: 
* The decision about revenue sharing on local rate numbers was a contributory factor in the explosive growth in dial internet. 
* The asynchronous reciprocity that exists between fixed and mobile termination rates.

The '''Jena Six''' were six [[African American|black]] teenagers in [[Jena, Louisiana]], convicted in the 2006 beating of Justin Barker, a [[White American|white]] student at the local [[Jena High School]], which they also attended. Barker was injured on December 4, 2006, by the members of the Jena Six, and received treatment at an emergency room. While the case was pending, it was often cited by some media commentators as an example of racial injustice in the United States. Some commentators believed that the defendants had been charged initially with too-serious offenses and had been treated unfairly.

A number of events had taken place in and around Jena in the months before the Barker assault, which the media have associated with an alleged escalation of local racial tensions. These events included the hanging of rope [[noose]]s from a tree in the high school courtyard, two violent confrontations between white and black youths, and the destruction by fire of the main building of Jena High School. Extensive news coverage related to the Jena Six often reported these events as linked.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; Federal and parish attorneys concluded from their investigations that assessment was inaccurate for some of the events; for instance, the burning of the high school was an attempt to destroy grade records.

Six students (Robert Bailey, then aged 17; Mychal Bell, then 16; Carwin Jones, then 18; Bryant Purvis, then 17; Jesse Ray Beard, then 14; and Theo Shaw, then 17) were [[arrest]]ed in the assault of Barker. Mychal Bell was initially convicted as an adult of [[Aggravated assault|aggravated battery]] and [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit aggravated battery. His convictions were overturned on the grounds that he should have been tried as a [[minor (law)|juvenile]]. Before a retrial in [[juvenile court]], Bell pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of [[battery (crime)|simple battery]]. The other five defendants later pleaded "[[no contest]]" to the same offense, and were convicted.

The Jena Six case sparked protests by people who considered the arrests and subsequent charges, initially [[attempted murder|attempted second-degree murder]], as excessive and racially discriminatory. The protesters asserted that white Jena youths involved in similar incidents were treated more leniently. On September 20, 2007, between 15,000 and 20,000&amp;nbsp;protesters marched on Jena in what was described as the "largest civil rights demonstration in years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Andy | last = Gallacher | title = Huge rally in small-town Louisiana | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7005866.stm | work = BBC News | publisher = BBC | location = Jena, Louisiana | date = September 21, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Maria | last = Newman | title = Jena, La. | url = http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/national/usstatesterritoriesandpossessions/louisiana/jena/index.html | work = The New York Times | publisher = The New York Times Company | date = September 24, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Related protests were held in other US cities on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Christine | last = Simmons | title = "Jena 6" Protest at Justice Dept | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/02/AR2007100202254.html | publisher = Associated Press via ''The Washington Post'' | location = Washington, D.C. | date = October 2, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent reactions included songs alluding to the Jena Six, numerous editorials and opinion columns, and congressional hearings.

== Background to the assault ==
[[File:Rsz schoolpicture.gif|thumb|right|Jena High School]]

At [[Jena High School]], about 10% of students are black and roughly 90% are white, reflecting the population of the town of Jena, which has about 3,000&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref name="cdata"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.city-data.com/city/Jena-Louisiana.html | title = Jena, Louisiana (LA) Detailed Profile | accessdate = 2008-08-25 |year=2007 | publisher = City-data.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some early reporting indicated that students of different races seldom sat together, for instance in the cafeteria, although this has been disputed.&lt;ref name="whitetree"&gt;{{cite news | first = Todd | last = Lewan | title = Black and White Becomes Gray in La.

At a school assembly held on August 31, 2006, a black male freshman asked the principal whether he could sit under the tree.&lt;ref name="stealth"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/this_world/6685441.stm | title = 'Stealth racism' stalks deep South | last = Mangold | first = Tom | publisher = BBC News | date = August 16, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Donald Washington, [[United States Attorney]] for the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana|Western District of Louisiana]], the principal said the question was posed in a "jocular fashion".&lt;ref name="clearup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990004 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130204060816/http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990004 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 4, 2013 |title=Official sought to clear up 'Jena Six' 'misinformation' |last=Brown |first=Abbey |publisher=The Town Talk |location=Alexandria-Pineville, Louisiana |date=July 31, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal told the students they could "sit wherever they wanted".&lt;ref name="stealth" /&gt; CNN reported that the freshman and his friends sat under the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/09/19/jackson.jena6/ | title = Jesse Jackson: Obama needs to bring more attention to Jena 6 | last = Mooney | first = Alexander | publisher = CNN | date = September 19, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Noose hanging ===
The following morning, students and staff discovered rope [[noose]]s hanging from the tree; reports differ as to whether there were two&lt;ref name="whitetree" /&gt; or three&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; nooses. A black teacher described seeing both white and black students "playing with [the nooses], pulling on them, jump-swinging from them, and putting their heads through them" that same day.&lt;ref name="whitetree" /&gt; Craig Franklin, assistant editor of ''The Jena Times'', said the nooses were hung as a prank by three students directed at white members of the school rodeo team. The school's investigating committee had concluded that "the three young teens had no knowledge that nooses symbolize the terrible legacy of the [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings]] of countless blacks in American history."&lt;ref name="MediaMyths" /&gt; The names of those who hung the nooses were not publicly disclosed.

=== Repercussions ===
The school disciplinary process that followed is unclear. It was reported that the principal learned that three white students were responsible and recommended [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]], that the [[board of education]] overruled his recommendation, and that school superintendent Roy Breithaupt agreed with the overruling. It was initially reported that the punishment was reduced to three days of in-school suspension.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/03/AR2007080302098.html | title = La. Town Fells 'White Tree,' but Tension Runs Deep | last = Fears | first = Darryl | publisher = The Washington Post | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | date = August 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the district's Crisis Management Policy Procedures, the three students were isolated at an alternative school "for about a month",&lt;ref name="whitetree" /&gt; spent two weeks on in-school suspension, served Saturday detentions, had to attend Discipline Court, were referred to Families in Need of Services, and had to have an evaluation before they were able to return to school.&lt;ref name="whitetree" /&gt;

The school superintendent was quoted as saying, "Adolescents play pranks. I don't think it was a threat against anybody."&lt;ref name="tribune2"&gt;{{cite news | first = Howard | last = Witt | title = Racial demons rear heads | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-elf2u1mmay20,1,3301167.story | publisher = Chicago Tribune | location = Jena, Louisiana | date = May 20, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Black residents of Jena have said that this comment stoked racial tensions leading to subsequent events.&lt;ref name="wapo" /&gt;

According to US Attorney Donald Washington, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) investigators found that the hanging of the nooses "had all the markings of a [[hate crime]]". But, it could not be prosecuted as such since juveniles are rarely prosecuted in the federal system, and this offense did not meet departmental standards for charges to be brought.&lt;ref name="notrelated"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/law/09/19/jena.six.link/index.html | title = U.S. Attorney: Nooses, beating at Jena High not related | date = September 19, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | publisher = CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[La Salle Parish, Louisiana|La Salle Parish]] District Attorney [[J.

The school treated the incident seriously and called police to the school in the days after the noose incident.&lt;ref name="whitlock" /&gt; The principal called an assembly on September 6, 2006. The Jena Police Department asked Parish Attorney Walters to attend and speak at the assembly. Already pressed for time due to a case under preparation, Walters felt that the students were not paying proper attention to him. He warned them, "I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. With the stroke of a pen I can make life miserable for you or ruin your life. So I want you to call me before you do something stupid."&lt;ref name="whitlock"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kansascity.com/sports/columnists/jason_whitlock/story/296701.html | title = Jena 6 case caught up in whirlwind of distortion, opportunism | last = Whitlock | first = Jason | authorlink = Jason Whitlock | date = September 29, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-10-01 | publisher = The Kansas City Star | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012042224/http://www.kansascity.com/sports/columnists/jason_whitlock/story/296701.html | archivedate = October 12, 2007|deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though black students say Walters was looking at them when he made the comments, Walters and school board member Billy Fowler, also present, deny it.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; Walters said that he was irritated at "two or three girls, white girls, [who] were chit-chatting on their cellphones or playing with their cellphones".&lt;ref name="MediaMyths" /&gt;

=== School arson, fight, and confrontation ===
On November 30, 2006, the main building of the high school was destroyed by arson. Although it would be many months before the perpetrators were known, the news media later widely cited the fire as a racially charged event leading up to the assault on Barker.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; On December 28, 2007, LaSalle Parish Sheriff- elect Scott Franklin announced that an investigation had shown that the fire was set in an effort to destroy grade records in the building and to close the school for a time. Six male suspects (three juveniles and three adults) had been arrested, and two more adult males were being sought. They were racially diverse. Franklin indicated that the fire was not racially motivated, and had no connection to the Jena Six.&lt;ref name="face charges" /&gt;  Two of the arson defendants pleaded guilty, and were sentenced to ten years in prison, with restitution ordered in the amount of $10 million.&lt;ref name="hot"&gt;{{cite news | title = Three still awaiting trial in Jena High arson case | work = The Town Talk | date = December 13, 2008}} {&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gotta go.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Gotta Go'' convenience store outside Jena, Louisiana]]

On December 1, 2006, a private party was held at the Jena Fair Barn.&lt;ref name="clearup" /&gt; Bailey and four other black youths tried to enter the party at about 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. According to U.S. Attorney Washington, they were told by a woman that no one was allowed inside without an invitation. The youths persisted, stating that some friends were already at the party. A white male, who was not a student, moved in front of the woman and a fight ensued. After the fight broke up, the woman told both the white male and the black students to leave the party. Once outside, the black students were involved in another fight with a group of white males who were not students.&lt;ref name="clearup" /&gt; Justin Sloan, a white male, was charged with [[battery (crime)|battery]] for his role in the fight and was put on probation. Bailey later said that one of the white males broke a beer bottle over his head,&lt;ref name="wapo" /&gt; but there are no records of Bailey receiving medical treatment.&lt;ref name="clearup" /&gt;

The following day, an incident occurred at the ''Gotta Go'' convenience store, outside Jena in unincorporated LaSalle Parish, between Matt Windham and three black youths, including Bailey.&lt;ref name="lasupct"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=State of Louisiana v.

Windham alleged that Bailey and his friends chased him, that he ran to get his gun, and that the students wrestled it away from him. According to the black students, as they left the convenience store, they were confronted by Windham with a shotgun. They said they wrestled the gun away from him and fled the scene. Bailey was charged with disturbing the peace, second-degree robbery, and theft of a firearm.&lt;ref name="face charges"&gt;{{cite news | first = Elaine | last = McKewon | title = Jena Six timeline | url = http://www.bayoubuzz.com/News/Louisiana/Politics/Jena_Six_Timeline__4731.asp | work = The Bayou Buzz | date = September 21, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-22 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011082448/http://www.bayoubuzz.com/News/Louisiana/Politics/Jena_Six_Timeline__4731.asp | archivedate = October 11, 2007|deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attack on Barker ==
On December 4, 2006, 17-year-old Justin Barker, a white Jena High School student, was punched, kicked, and stomped on while at school by a group of black students. They first said that he had made a racist joke; some changed their account and said their actions were in response to the three nooses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44275022/t/years-later-jena-move/ | title = 5 years later, Jena 6 move on | date = August 25, 2011 | accessdate = 2015-12-20 | publisher = NBC News | last = Foster | first = Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superintendent Breithaupt described the battery as a "premeditated ambush and attack by six students against one. The victim attacked was beaten and kicked into a state of bloody unconsciousness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = CBS News | title = Jena Six teen to be freed on bail | date = September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Barker was released from a local emergency room after three hours of treatment and observation for a [[concussion]] and an eye that had swollen shut.&lt;ref name="wapo" /&gt; The emergency physician's record shows that he also had injuries to his face, ears, and hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/70916045 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090717110417/http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F99999999%2FNEWS%2F70916045 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 17, 2009 |title=Documents give details about fight |date=June 11, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |publisher=The Town Talk |last=Brown |first=Abbey |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He  attended his school's [[Class ring|class ring ceremony]] and dance that evening. He later testified, "I waited 11&amp;nbsp;years to go to it. I wasn't going to let that get in my way." He left the dance early due to pain.&lt;ref name="testify"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.katc.com/Global/story.asp?S=6719374 | title = Victim in Jena 6 case takes the stand | date = June 11, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-09-20 |agency=Associated Press | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011143108/http://www.katc.com/Global/story.asp?S=6719374 | archivedate = October 11, 2007|deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial, Barker testified that his face was badly swollen after the attack and that he suffered a loss of vision in one eye for three weeks. He said that he had suffered recurring headaches and forgetfulness since the attack.&lt;ref name="forget"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19488285/ | title = Black teen convicted in beating of white student | date = July 2, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-09-23 |agency=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

US Attorney Washington states he does not believe the noose incident and the beatings were related.  Walters likewise said that he believes there is no linkage between the noose incident and the beating. "When this case was brought to me and during our investigation and during the trial, there was no such linkage ever suggested. This compact story line has only been suggested after the fact."&lt;ref name="notrelated" /&gt; Although Washington believes that both the noose hangings and the Barker battery were symptoms of racial tension, he has also said that there was no apparent lingering anger among students at the school after the nooses were found.&lt;ref name="distort"&gt;{{cite news | title = U.S. Attorney: Critics in Jena Six case have distorted the facts | url = http://www.ktbs.com/story/22372203/us-attorney-critics-in-jena-six-case-have-distorted-the-facts | publisher = KTBS-3 | date = April 30, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-05-24 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20141217190658/http://www.ktbs.com/story/22372203/us-attorney-critics-in-jena-six-case-have-distorted-the-facts | archivedate = December 17, 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criminal cases ==
Law enforcement arrested six students, eventually dubbed the "Jena Six", who were accused in the attack on Barker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/law/09/04/bell.jena.six/ | publisher = CNN | title = Residents: Nooses spark school violence, divide town | accessdate = 2007-09-04 | date = September 5, 2007 |author=McLaughlin, Eliott C. &amp; [[Susan Roesgen|Roesgen, Susan]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Five of them (Robert Bailey, Jr., then 17; Mychal Bell, then 16; Carwin Jones, then 18; Bryant Purvis, then 17; and Theo Shaw, then 17) were charged with attempted murder.&lt;ref name="lasupct" /&gt; The sixth student, Jesse Ray Beard (also known as Jesse Rae Beard), was charged as a juvenile. Walters charged Mychal Bell as an adult,&lt;ref name="overturn" /&gt; although he was only 16, because of his previous [[criminal record]] and because Walters believed Bell initiated the attack.&lt;ref name="releaseabc" /&gt;

=== Mychal Bell proceedings ===
District Judge J. P. Mauffray, Jr. presided over Bell's trial. On the first day of trial, June 26, 2007, Walters reduced the charges to aggravated second-degree battery and conspiracy to commit aggravated second-degree battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,,-6738454,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025141828/http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0%2C%2C-6738454%2C00.html |archivedate=October 25, 2007 |title=Charges Reduced for Student in La.

Before the trial began, [[public defender]] Blane Williams had urged Bell to accept a [[plea bargain]].

The jury found Bell guilty, and he faced the possibility of up to 22&amp;nbsp;years in prison. The judge scheduled sentencing for September 20, 2007. Bell's new defense attorneys, Bob Noel, Walter Lee Perkins Jr., Peggy Sullivan, Louis Scott and Carol Powell-Lexing, requested a new trial on the grounds that Bell should not have been [[tried as an adult]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990017 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120917194828/http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990017 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 17, 2012 |title=Defense attorney says Bell case should be in juvenile system |date=August 16, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |last=Brown |first=Abbey |publisher=The Town Talk }}&lt;/ref&gt; A request to lower Bell's $90,000&amp;nbsp;bond was denied on August 24, 2007, due to his juvenile record.

While on probation, he was convicted of another battery charge and two charges of criminal damage to property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.shreveporttimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070825/NEWS03/708250353 | title = 'Jena Six' defendant's criminal history comes to light; bond denied | date = August 25, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | last = Brown | first = Abbey | publisher = ''The Town Talk'' via ''The Shreveport Times'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the battery charges was reportedly for punching a 17-year-old girl in the face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 'Jena Six' controversy swirls around football star | publisher = ESPN | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=3030458 | date = September 21, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 |author1=Barr, John  |author2=Noren, Nicole }}&lt;/ref&gt; The media had initially reported that Bell had no prior criminal record.&lt;ref name="wapo" /&gt; On September 4, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07/09/05/1422246 |title=Judge reduces charges in Jena 6 case but refuses to overturn Mychal Bell conviction |date=September 5, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |publisher=Democracy Now! |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114112430/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07%2F09%2F05%2F1422246 |archivedate=November 14, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Mauffray [[Vacated judgment|vacated]] the conspiracy conviction on the grounds that Bell should have been tried as a juvenile, but he let the battery conviction stand.&lt;ref name="premature"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/law/09/19/jena.six/ | title = Court: It's 'premature' to consider motion to release Jena 6 defendant | date = September 19, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | publisher = CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell [[appeal]]ed his conviction, principally on the ground that he had been improperly tried as an adult. On September 14, 2007, Louisiana's Third Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Bell's battery conviction, agreeing that this remaining charge was not among those for which a juvenile may be tried as an adult.&lt;ref name="overturn"&gt;{{cite news | title = Court overturns conviction in Jena beating | publisher = MSNBC | date = September 14, 2007 | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20779755/ | accessdate = 2007-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 2007, Mauffray found that Bell had violated the terms of his [[probation]] for previous convictions. The judge sentenced Bell to 18 months in a juvenile facility on two counts of simple battery and two counts of criminal destruction of property, and Bell was taken into custody. According to Walters, the matter was unrelated to the assault on Barker, and it had not been referred to during the Barker proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 'Jena Six' teen Mychal Bell back in jail |agency=Associated Press | date = October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The defense filed a motion to dismiss the Barker charges on the ground that retrying Bell would amount to [[double jeopardy]]. On November 8, 2007, Mauffray denied the motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Court rejects motion to dismiss juvenile charges in racial school attacks |agency=Associated Press | date = November 8, 2007 | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/08/america/NA-GEN-US-Racial-School-Attack.php | publisher=''International Herald Tribune'' |accessdate = 2008-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell's retrial in the Barker assault was scheduled for December 6. Three days before the trial began, he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of battery, and was sentenced to 18&amp;nbsp;months in a juvenile facility, with credit for time served. He agreed to testify against any of the other assault defendants at trial. All appeals were dropped as part of the [[Plea bargain|plea agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bell admits role in attack |publisher=The Town Talk |last=Brown |first=Abbey |date=December 4, 2007 |url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990133 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120918224933/http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990133 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 18, 2012 |accessdate=2007-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Remaining defendants ===
On September 4, 2007, charges against Carwin Jones and Theo Shaw were reduced to aggravated second-degree battery and conspiracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Charges Reduced in 'Jena 6' Attack | publisher = Associated Press via ''The Washington Post'' | date = September 4, 2007 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/04/AR2007090401047.html | accessdate = 2007-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as were those of Robert Bailey, Jr. on September 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Another Charge Reduced in 'Jena 6' Case | publisher = KYW-TV | date = September 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant Purvis was arraigned on reduced charges of aggravated battery and conspiracy to commit aggravated battery on November 7, 2007, and pleaded not guilty.&lt;ref name="nov7towntalk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Final 'Jena Six' defendant, Purvis, pleads not guilty to reduced charges |publisher=The Town Talk |date=November 8, 2007 |url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990122 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130204080735/http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990122 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 4, 2013 |accessdate=2008-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Louisiana law considers seventeen-year-olds to be adults for purposes of criminal culpability, the charges for these four were unaffected by the appellate ruling overturning Bell's conviction.&lt;ref name="overturn" /&gt;

Proceedings were on hold for some time pending resolution of various motions to require Mauffray to [[Judicial disqualification#Recusal in the United States|recuse himself]]. On July 31, 2008, Mauffray was removed from the cases by Judge Thomas Yeager for making questionable comments about the defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Judge in Jena 6 case is removed | work = Detroit Free Press | date = August 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Louisiana Supreme Court]] assigned Judge Yeager to hear the five remaining cases by order signed August 4, 2008.&lt;ref name="Yeager"&gt;{{cite news | title = Judge Yeager to hear 'Jena Six' cases | work = The Town Talk | date = August 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Walters appealed the recusal order, but his appeal was dismissed on March 4, 2009, as moot, or no longer relevant, as Mauffray had left the bench at the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Appeals court: "Jena Six" recusal issue moot point | work = The Town Talk | date = March 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2009, the remaining five defendants entered pleas of "no contest" to a charge of simple battery.&lt;ref name="ttover"&gt;{{cite news|title='Jena Six' case ends: Remaining 5 defendants given 7 days probation, apologize |work=The Town Talk |date=June 27, 2009 |url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20090627/NEWS01/906270304/-1/NEWSFRONT2/-Jena-Six--case-ends--Remaining-5-defendants-given-7-days-probation--apologize |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130205014318/http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20090627/NEWS01/906270304/-1/NEWSFRONT2/-Jena-Six--case-ends--Remaining-5-defendants-given-7-days-probation--apologize |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 5, 2013 |accessdate=2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court found them guilty as charged, and sentenced each to a fine of $500 (waived in regards to Shaw due to the time he spent in jail), $500 to be paid as court costs, restitution to be paid to the Barker family (with whom the defendants were ordered to have no contact), and seven days of unsupervised probation.  The defendants' lawyers read a statement apologizing to the Barker family and to the town. Addressing the rumors that the attack had been provoked by Barker using a racial epithet, they said on behalf of the defendants:&lt;ref name="over"&gt;{{cite news | last = Morgan | first = Robert | title = Five defendants plead no contest in 'Jena Six' case | work = CNN | date = June 26, 2009 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/06/26/louisiana.jena.6/ | accessdate = 2009-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yeager, who presided over the plea and sentencing, also ordered the youths to avoid criminal activity, and not to disavow the statement made on their behalf in court.&lt;ref name="ttover" /&gt;  On June 26, it was announced that the civil case by Barker against the Jena Six members had been settled on undisclosed terms. His civil case against the school board was pending.&lt;ref name="ttciv"&gt;{{cite news|last=Morgan |first=Robert |title=Secret settlement reached in 'Jena Six' civil suit |work=The Town Talk |date=June 27, 2009 |url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20090627/NEWS01/906270303/-1/NEWSFRONT2/Secret-settlement-reached-in--Jena-Six--civil-suit |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419015344/http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20090627/NEWS01/906270303/-1/NEWSFRONT2/Secret-settlement-reached-in--Jena-Six--civil-suit |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 19, 2013 |accessdate=2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media coverage ==

===News coverage===
Initially, the Jena Six were largely ignored by the United States national media, though covered locally and within Louisiana. Both ''The Jena Times''&lt;ref name="MediaMyths"/&gt; and ''The Town Talk'' (a regional newspaper published in [[Alexandria, Louisiana]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jena Six|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/70915030|work=The Town Talk|date=September 3, 2007|accessdate=2008-09-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130204054648/http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/70915030|archivedate=February 4, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; covered the story from its inception. A number of African-American bloggers also covered the story before there was mainstream national press coverage.&lt;ref name="blogs help drive" /&gt; The first piece on the case to be published by an outside source ran on May 9, 2007, in ''[[Left Turn (magazine)|Left Turn]]'', a small [[alternative news]] magazine.&lt;ref name="Leftturn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leftturn.mayfirst.org/?q=node/649 |title=Justice in Jena |accessdate=2007-10-20 |date=May 9, 2007 |last=Flaherty |first=Jordan |publisher=Left Turn Magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011212346/http://leftturn.mayfirst.org/?q=node%2F649 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mainstream US print media outlet to cover the matter was the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', whose Southwest Bureau Chief, Howard Witt, wrote a piece covering the story on May 20.&lt;ref name="tribune2"/&gt; Witt had received a summary of the situation&lt;ref name="foj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://friendsofjustice.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/responding_to_the_crisis_in_jena1.doc|title=Responding to the crisis in Jena, Louisiana|accessdate=2007-10-22|publisher=Friends of Justice |format=DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Alan Bean (activist)|Alan Bean]], a Texas minister who had founded the advocacy group Friends of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://friendsofjustice.wordpress.com/2007/10/02/howard-witt-responds-indirectly-to-jason-whitlock|title=Howard Witt Responds (indirectly) to Jason Whitlock|accessdate=2008-08-22|date=October 2, 2007|publisher=Friends of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group sent its document to other reporters and bloggers. In it Bean demanded that outside authorities, not those in LaSalle Parish, deal with the case, and that no incarceration of the defendants occur.&lt;ref name="foj"/&gt; [[United Kingdom|Britain's]] ''[[The Observer]]'' also featured an article on the case on May 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom|last=Mangold|title=Racism goes on trial again in America's Deep South|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,2083762,00.html|work=The Observer|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|location=Jena, Louisiana|date=May 20, 2007|accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A segment on a [[BBC]] program ''[[This World (television programme)|This World]]'' followed on May 24.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/6677057.stm "Race Hate in Louisiana"], ''This World'', bbc.co.uk, May 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The case began to receive more extensive national media coverage in July 2007, with [[CNN]] interviewing Jena residents and parents of those involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2007/07/01/roesgen.la.jena.6.update.affl?iref=videosearch CNN segment from Jena], CNN Newsroom video, July 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the racial history of the Deep South, many news reports from Jena evoked the [[Civil Rights Movement]], referred to historic [[lynching]], or [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]].&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;

Some sources pointed to inaccurate reporting by the media. The [[Associated Press]] published an article noting the various reporting errors that have been made, including whether the tree was a "white tree", the number of nooses, and the discipline given to the noose-hanging students.&lt;ref name="whitetree"/&gt; Based on this, MTV posted a retraction for incorrect information that it had reported on the case from other news sources.&lt;ref name="MTVerror"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1570444/20070924/id_0.jhtml|title=Jena Report Attempts To Sift Fact From Fiction; FBI Probes White-Supremacist Response|accessdate=2007-09-27|date=September 24, 2007|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Columnists and editorials ===
Many major editorial pages and columnists have been sympathetic to the supporters of the Jena Six. They have used the case to discuss broader trends of racism in the US criminal justice system and to call for a renewed civil rights movement. Most editorials were published around the time of the Jena rally. ''[[The New York Post]]'', in a September 23, 2007, editorial, stated "it's impossible to examine the case of the so-called Jena Six without concluding that these black teens have been the victims of a miscarriage of justice, with a clearly racial double standard at work."&lt;ref name="nyposted"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nypost.com/seven/09232007/postopinion/editorials/the_jena_six.htm | title = The Jena Six | accessdate = 2007-10-23 | date = September 23, 2007 | publisher = New York Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; Byron Williams, writing on the ''[[Huffington Post]]'', was one of several to cite the [[Urban League]]'s 2005 finding that the average black male convicted of aggravated assault serves 48&amp;nbsp;months in prison, one-third longer than a comparable white man.&lt;ref name="ByronWilliams"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/byron-williams/oldfashioned-southern-ju_b_65178.html | title = Old Fashioned Southern Justice in the Modern South | work = The Huffington Post | date = September 20, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | last = Williams | first = Byron }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 report also found that a black male who is arrested is three times more likely to go to jail than a white male arrested for the same crime.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/features/july-dec07/jena_9-24.html | title = Jena Six Rally Highlights Racial Tensions | date = September 24, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | last = Miller | first = Talea | publisher = PBS }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/21/2040080.htm | title = Jena 6 case sparks anti-racism protest | accessdate = 2007-09-27 | date = September 21, 2007 | last = Landers | first = Kim | publisher = ABC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="younge"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/Columnists/Column/0,,2170644,00.html | title = Apart from the noose, this is an everyday story of modern America | date = September 17, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | last = Younge | first = Gary | publisher = The Guardian | location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="page"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/09/injustice_is_bigger_than_jena.html | title = Injustice is bigger than the 'Jena 6' | date = September 25, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-09-27 | last = Page | first = Clarence | authorlink = Clarence Page | publisher = ''The Baltimore Sun'' via RealClearPolitics }}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the same statistics, syndicated columnist [[Clarence Page]] wrote that "The best legacy for the Jena March 6&amp;nbsp;would be a new movement, dedicated this time to the reduction and elimination of unequal justice wherever it appears. I don't care who leads it, but it shouldn't be for blacks only."&lt;ref name="page" /&gt; Writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'', Professor [[Orlando Patterson]] of [[Harvard University]] used the case to highlight the use of the prison system as a means of "controlling young black men", which is one factor in a broader "crisis in relations between men and women of all classes and, as a result, the catastrophic state of black family life".&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=/2007/09/30/opinion/30patterson.html | title = Jena, O.J., and the jailing of Black America | date = September 30, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | last = Patterson | first = Orlando | authorlink = Orlando Patterson | newspaper = The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other columnists have argued that inaccuracies in the media coverage unfairly tarnish the town and have led to a national overreaction, part of the tendency in the 24-hour news cycle. ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' columnist Heather MacDonald, while condemning the noose hangings as a "despicable provocation", said that "the media, the (race) advocates and pandering politicians have erupted in an outpouring of seeming joy at the alleged proof that America remains a racist country."&lt;ref name="macdonald"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mac Donald |first=Heather |authorlink=Heather Mac Donald |date=September 30, 2007 |title=Don't make Jena out to be more than it is |newspaper=The Dallas Morning News |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/points/stories/DN-macdonald_30edi.ART.State.Edition1.4257c86.html |accessdate=2008-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315020726/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/points/stories/DN-macdonald_30edi.ART.State.Edition1.4257c86.html |archivedate=March 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a column in the ''[[Kansas City Star]]'', [[Jason Whitlock]] drew attention to what he called factual inaccuracies in reporting of the story. He focused on the piece circulated by Bean to news outlets, "Bean's story is framed—by his own admission—as an indictment of the criminal justice system and the people in power in Jena and, therefore, the story is unfairly biased."&lt;ref name="whitlock" /&gt; Craig Franklin, assistant editor of ''The Jena Times'', who says that he is the only writer to have covered this story from its inception, wrote in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]],'' "I have never before witnessed such a disgrace in professional journalism. Myths replaced facts&amp;nbsp;... the truth about Jena will eventually be known."&lt;ref name="MediaMyths" /&gt;

== Public response ==
The case provoked reactions that the charges against the Jena Six were disproportionate and racially motivated. Supporters of the Jena Six circulated online petitions, raised money for legal defense, and held a demonstration in Jena on September 20, 2007. This event attracted thousands marching in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Thousands March to Decry Treatment of Jena Six | date = September 20, 2007 |agency=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rallies ===

=== Artistic tributes ===
Several songs have been produced in response to the Jena Six case. [[John Mellencamp]] released a song and video called "Jena", with lyrics such as "Jena, take your nooses down" which gained considerable media attention, and which Mellencamp described as a "condemnation of racism."&lt;ref name="mellencamp"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,299824,00.html | title = Louisiana mayor balks at Mellencamp 'Jena 6' protest song and video | accessdate = 2008-09-02 | date = October 6, 2007 | publisher = Associated Press via Foxnews | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090125153714/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,299824,00.html# | archive-date = 2009-01-25 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The video juxtaposes images of Jena, the high school, and the tree with video from the 1960s, including civil rights marchers and police beatings.

"[[Blood at the Root]]" is a play written by Dominique Morisseau about the Jena 6. Blood at the Root premiered on March 28, 2014 at Penn State Center Stage. The story is told through the lens of one of the Jena 6's sister, who also attended the high school. The audience is able to experience the series of events that led up to the convictions from multiple students' unique perspective. It has toured internationally and has been described as "catalyzing conversations on difficult and essential questions of race and justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brantley|first1=Ben|title='Blood at the Root' Draws Inspiration From the Jena Six Case in Louisiana|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/theater/blood-at-the-root-draws-inspiration-from-the-jena-six-case-in-louisiana.html?mcubz=3&amp;_r=0|accessdate=1 September 2017|publisher=New York TimesBr|date=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jena Six petition.JPG|thumb|An activist for [[A.N.S.W.E.R.]] gathers petition signatures at a [[Los Angeles]] rally, October 2007.]]

Many online petitions have circulated calling for various actions in response to the Jena Six case. Online advocacy group [[Color of Change]], which had previously advocated for victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]], called for District Attorney Walters to drop all charges and for Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] to investigate his conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorofchange.org/jena/main.html |title=Justice for the Jena 6 |accessdate=2007-10-18 |author=Color of Change |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011001120/http://www.colorofchange.org/jena/main.html |archivedate=2007-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Color of Change raised more than $212,000 for the Jena Six legal defense, largely through online donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Joe | last = Garofoli | title = Louisiana's Jena Six beating case galvanizes S.F.'s 'black MoveOn' | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/09/22/MNEISAVOE.DTL | publisher = San Francisco Chronicle | date = September 22, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.colorofchange.org/jena_fund/info.html |title=How funds are managed |author=Color of Change |accessdate=2008-02-08 |publisher=Color of Change }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the NAACP provided a link to the fund through its website, initially, the donation link on the NAACP Jena Six support page steered potential donors to the generic NAACP donation page, with no way to designate funds for the Jena Six. Black bloggers objected, and several days later, the link was altered to reach the defense fund.&lt;ref name="blogs help drive"&gt;{{cite news | first = Howard | last = Witt | title = Blogs help drive Jena protest | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-jena_blog_web19,0,1970628.story | publisher = Chicago Tribune | location = Jena, Louisiana | date = September 18, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] represented Beard, hired local defense counsel to represent Bailey, and helped coordinate the overall defense strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Scott | last = Michels | title = Civil Rights Leaders Urge Action in Racially Charged La.

In the months following the Jena Six rally, controversy arose about accounting and dispersal of the legal defense funds. Questions about the money were first sparked by photos posted on Robert Bailey's former [[MySpace]] account, which show him with quantities of hundred dollar bills stuffed in his mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990074 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130204053218/http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990074 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 4, 2013 |title='Jena Six' notebook |accessdate=2007-11-10 |date=September 28, 2007 |publisher=The Town Talk }}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy expanded when radio host [[Michael Baisden]] accused Color of Change of being "shady" with their use of the funds. Color of Change responded to the accusations by posting links to canceled checks on their web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorofchange.org/jena/baisden/ |title=False allegations on the Michael Baisden Show |accessdate=2008-02-08 |publisher=Color of Change |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302202444/http://www.colorofchange.org/jena/baisden/ |archivedate=2008-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his November 10 report, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' correspondent Howard Witt noted that Color of Change was the only national civil rights group to be fully transparent with their use of the funds.&lt;ref name="funds controversy"&gt;{{cite news | first = Howard | last = Witt | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-jena_bdnov11,1,5899685.story | title = Controversy over the Jena 6 funds | date = November 11, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-02 | publisher = Chicago Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt; But Witt raised broader questions about the funds, which totaled more than half a million dollars. He reported that attorneys for Bell claimed that they have yet to receive any money from him, and that the six families had refused to publicly account for the donations.&lt;ref name="funds controversy" /&gt;

On September 22, 2007, the [[FBI]] opened an investigation of a [[white supremacist]] website that listed the addresses of five of the Jena Six and the telephone numbers of some of their families "in case anyone wants to deliver justice". An FBI spokeswoman said the agency believed that the website "essentially called for their [[lynching]]".&lt;ref name="FBIprobe" /&gt; Civil rights advocate [[Al Sharpton]] has said that some of the families have continuously received threatening and harassing phone calls.&lt;ref name="FBIprobe"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/22/AR2007092201404.html?nav=rss_technology | title = FBI probes anti-Jena 6 Web page | accessdate = 2007-09-25 | date = September 22, 2007 | last = Bohrer | first = Becky | agency = Associated Press | work = The Washington Post | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121106135112/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/22/AR2007092201404.html?nav=rss_technology | archivedate = November 6, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later developments ==
On September 25, 2007, Representative [[John Conyers]] (D), Chairman of the [[House Judiciary Committee]], announced that he would hold congressional hearings on what he described as "the miscarriages of justice that have occurred in Jena, Louisiana," with the goal of pressuring the [[United States Department of Justice]] into taking action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/25/AR2007092501666.html | title = Lawmakers Seek Jena 6 Teen's Release | date = September 25, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | publisher = Associated Press via ''The Washington Post'' | last = Barrett | first = Devlin }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing took place on October 16, 2007; Washington and Sharpton, among others, testified. Walters was invited to testify but declined. Most Republican members of the committee declined to attend. Representative [[Sheila Jackson Lee]] (D-Texas) said to Washington and other Justice Department officials, "Shame on you. ... As a parent, I'm on the verge of tears,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-10-16-650507891_x.htm | title = Lawmakers Seek US Action in Jena 6 Case | publisher = USA Today | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | date = October 16, 2007 | last = Barrett | first = Devlin }}&lt;/ref&gt; and said, "I want to know what you're going to do to get Mychal Bell out of jail!"&lt;!--emphasis was in original--&gt;&lt;ref name="darryl"&gt;{{cite news | first = Darryl | last = Fears | title = U.S. Attorney Calls Noose Display 'Hate Crime,' Explains Lack of Charges | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/16/AR2007101600200.html | publisher = The Washington Post | date = October 17, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; US Attorney Washington responded that the federal government had a limited role to play in the matter.&lt;ref name="darryl" /&gt;

Representative Lee and other members of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] called upon outgoing Louisiana Governor Blanco to [[pardon]] the Jena Six on December 19, 2007, stating that "we believe Mychal Bell and the Jena 6 have paid a sufficient debt to society for any transgressions they may have committed."&lt;ref name="pardonme" /&gt; Blanco's office responded that she cannot grant pardons without a recommendation from the state Pardon Board, and no meeting of that body was scheduled during her remaining term of office. Walters commented that Representative Lee's "passion for racial equality is admirable, but her grasp of the facts is not."&lt;ref name="pardonme" /&gt; He indicated that the attack on Barker was not just a schoolyard fight "but rather an unprovoked, unforeseen assault on a young man who had nothing to do with the hanging of the nooses."&lt;ref name="pardonme"&gt;{{cite news | title = Black congressional members seek pardon for 'Jena Six'  |agency=Associated Press | date = December 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Blanco's term of office ended without any pardons being granted.

On July 31, 2007, the school had the controversial tree cut down.&lt;ref name="wapo" /&gt; School Board member Fowler said, "There's nothing positive about that old tree. It's all negative. And I'm serving on the new School Board, and we're wanting to start fresh on some things."&lt;ref name="cutdown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990005 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090717105743/http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F99999999%2FNEWS%2F399990005 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 17, 2009 |title=Jena High 'noose' tree cut down |date=July 31, 2008 |publisher=The Town Talk |accessdate=2008-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fowler, the tree would have had to have been cut down to make way for the rebuilding of the school after the fire. Others thought that taking down the tree was not an effective way to address any problems of racism in Jena. "Cutting down that beautiful tree won't solve the problem at hand," said Caseptla Bailey, Robert Bailey's mother. "It still happened."&lt;ref name="cutdown" /&gt;  The remains of the building have been cleared, and a bid accepted for the reconstruction.

Jones and Purvis attended the [[BET Hip Hop Awards]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] on October 13, 2007, and were invited to present the award for [[BET Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=/www/story/10-15-2007/0004682354 | title = Kanye West, Nelly, Common, Dr. Cornel West, MC Lyte, David Banner, Dr. Michael Eric Dyson, Lil' Wayne, Soulja Boy and Hurricane Chris, Among Others, Brought Style, Substance and Swagger to the BET HIP HOP AWARDS 2007 | accessdate = 2007-10-18 | publisher = PR Newswire/BET Networks }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the two defendants came out on stage, they were greeted by a standing ovation.

Justin Barker and his parents filed a civil suit on November 29, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/12/04/national/main3575112.shtml?source=RSSattr=U.S._3575112 | title = Victim in Jena Six case files suit | publisher = Associated Press via CBS News | date = December 4, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; against the parents of those accused of beating him, the adult members of the Jena Six (as of the time of the attack), an additional student named Malcolm Shaw, and the LaSalle Parish School Board.&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-12-04-jena-six_N.htm?csp=34 | title = Beating victim's family sues in 'Jena Six' case | date = December 4, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | work = USA Today }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barker's medical bills from his emergency room visit totaled more than $5,000.&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt; The lawsuit alleges that the LaSalle Parish School Board inadequately supervised students and failed to maintain discipline.&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt; The Barkers also allege that the school board did not implement a plan to "discourage the dangerous activity of threatening and attacking other students while in possession of actual knowledge of said threats and prior attacks while the students are on school grounds".&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt;

The case was on hold pending resolution of the criminal cases. When the Barkers' attorney learned that Jesse Ray Beard was using defense funds (which might be garnished under a civil suit) to pay for private school, he decided to push ahead with the case. Following a motion by Bell's civil attorney to recuse Mauffray in the civil case, proceedings were put on hold again pending appointment of a judge to hear that recusal motion.&lt;ref name="on hold"&gt;{{cite news |author=Abbey Brown | title = Jena Six cases linger more than a year later |date = September 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mauffray subsequently retired.

In February 2007, Jesse Ray Beard was charged with, and subsequently convicted of and sentenced for, simple battery, simple criminal damage to property less than $500, and simple assault. He received a suspended sentence of incarceration, and was placed on house arrest.&lt;ref name="charges"&gt;{{cite news|title=Louisiana youth getting a break|work=New Milford Times|date=August 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, 2008, Beard, by then aged 17, was released from house arrest so that he could attend a summer program and football camp in [[New York (state)|New York]]. It was revealed at a hearing on that date that Beard had been recommended for expulsion for 13 disciplinary actions, but that the recommendation had been overturned. In New York, he stayed with Alan Howard, a local attorney who represented Beard in the civil suit, and worked as an intern in the attorney's office, while taking summer courses to prepare him for junior year.&lt;ref name= newlife/&gt; He was required to return to Jena by August 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Jena Six' defendant removed from house arrest|work=The Town Talk|date=July 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corwin Jones was arrested on May 10, 2008, at the age of 19 in LaSalle Parish on a charge of misdemeanor simple battery.

'''Jury selection''' is the selection of the people who will serve on a [[jury]] during a [[jury trial]]. The group of potential jurors (the "jury pool", also known as the ''venire'') is first selected from among the community using a reasonably random method. Jury lists are compiled from voter registrations and driver license or ID renewals.  From those lists, summons are mailed. A panel of jurors is then assigned to a courtroom. The prospective jurors are randomly selected to sit in the jury box. At this stage they will be questioned in court by the judge and/or attorneys [[Jury selection in the United States|in the United States]]. Depending on the jurisdiction, attorneys may have an opportunity to mount a ''challenge for cause'' argument or use one of a limited number of [[peremptory challenge]]s. In some jurisdictions that have [[capital punishment]], the jury must be [[death-qualified jury|death-qualified]] to remove those who are opposed to the death penalty. Jury selection and techniques for ''[[voir dire]]'' are taught to law students in [[trial advocacy]] courses.  However, attorneys sometimes use expert assistance in [[scientific jury selection|systematically choosing the jury]], although other uses of [[jury research]] are becoming more common. The jury selected is said to have been "empaneled".

==''Voir dire''==
{{Main|Voir dire}}
[[File:Jury selection - Faulk.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Depiction of an attorney asking questions during jury selection.]]
Selected jurors are generally subjected to a system of examination whereby both the prosecution (or plaintiff, in a civil case) and defense can object to a juror. In [[common law]] countries, this is known as ''voir dire''. ''Voir dire'' can include both general questions asked of an entire pool of prospective jurors, answered by means such as a show of hands, and questions asked of individual prospective jurors and calling for a verbal answer. In some [[jurisdiction]]s, the attorneys for the parties may question the potential jurors; in other jurisdictions, the trial judge conducts the ''voir dire''.

The method and scope of the possible rejections varies between countries:
* In [[English criminal law|England]], these objections would have to be very well based, such as the defendant knowing a potential juror, to be allowed.
* Some jurisdictions, including [[Criminal law in Australia|Australia]], [[Criminal law of Canada|Canada]], [[Law of France|France]], [[Law of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Criminal law of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]], the [[Law of Ireland|Republic of Ireland]], and the [[Criminal law of the United States|United States]], give both the defense and prosecution a specific number of unconditional [[peremptory challenge]]s. No justifications have to be brought to exclude a specific juror. Generally, defense attorneys exclude jurors who have professions or backgrounds similar to that of the victim and who could thus feel an emotional link to them, while prosecuting attorneys exclude jurors who might show affinity to the defendant. However, in the United States, if either party excludes a [[minority group]] member and the other party challenges, under ''[[Batson v. Kentucky|Batson]]'' rules the party exercising the peremptory strike must provide a race-neutral reason for the exclusion (later extended by court rulings to gender-neutral reasons as well). Parties have been known to peremptorily strike jurors based on personal characteristics that wouldn't justify a [[strike for cause]], but which they believe makes the juror less likely to be sympathetic to their side.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907358,00.html|title=The Law: Women, Gimps, Blacks, Hippies Need Not Apply|date=June 4, 1973|publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In some jurisdictions, attorneys also have the right to make a ''challenge for cause'' argument to the judge. This is an argument over whether a juror's particular background or beliefs make them biased and therefore unsuitable for service on the jury.

=== United States ===
{{main|Jury selection in the United States}}
{{See also|Taylor v. Louisiana}}
In the United States the process of ''voir dire'' is often much more in depth than in other countries and its practical implementation is somewhat controversial because of this. The amount of privacy that the potential jurors are afforded when asked questions raises the issue of the definition of "impartial jury". Some people{{Who|date=June 2010}} are skeptical as to whether the intensive questioning of potential jurors looks not just for inherent bias but for a potential to be emotionally swayed. On the other hand, proponents argue that this method gives both sides more confidence in the verdict.

=== Canada ===
Part XX of the ''Criminal Code of Canada'' allows for a jury in a Canadian murder trial to consist of twelve jurors. However, a minimum of ten jurors and a maximum of 14 jurors may hear the evidence a trial. At the end of trial, a maximum of twelve jurors and minimum of ten jurors may deliberate. 

Section 631(2.2) as well as section 643 of the ''Criminal Code'' specify that a jury may consist of either 12, 13 or 14 members, however, 12 is most common. Section 631(2.2) allows a judge to order that 13 or 14 jurors be sworn in under certain circumstances.  

Jurors may also be excused during trial. According to section 644(1) of the ''Criminal Code'', a judge may discharge any juror during the trial due to illness or “other reasonable cause” such as impartiality (see ''R v Tsouma'' (1973) and R v Holcomb (1973)). Section 644(2) further specifies that a jury is still properly constituted to complete its duties even if a juror is discharged during the trial as long as the number of jurors is not reduced below ten. 

At the conclusion of trial and following the jury charge, a maximum of twelve jurors may deliberate. It requires the judge to pull numbers from a box in order to determine which jurors should be discharged in order to reduce the number of jurors down to twelve.

'''Jury Identification'''
When empanelling the jury, section 631(3) of the Criminal Code states that the court clerk will draw out the appropriate number of juror cards and read out the name and number of each card in the courtroom. In this sense, the identity of the jurors will be revealed to all parties. However, s. 631(3.1) goes on to say that judge can order that the clerk of the court shall only call out the number on each card, thereby withholding the names of the jury members. This generally takes place upon application by the prosecutor or when the judge deems it necessary in order to protect the safety and privacy of the jury members. 

Under s. 631(6) of the Code, the presiding judge may then make an order either directing that the identity of a jury member or any information that could reveal their identity not be published or broadcast in any way; or limiting access to or the use of that information. These amendments to s. 361 were introduced in 2001, with the purpose of “protecting jurors from intimidation, and enabling jurors to participate effectively by making them free to act without being subjected to threats, prejudice, intimidation or physical injury” (R v Jacobson, [2004] O.J. No. 1432 (OSCJ), at para 23).

'''Peremptory Challenges''' 

In Canada, the number of peremptory challenges (i.e., challenges for which no reason be given) for jury selection is governed by Section 634 of the Criminal Code of Canada. The number of peremptory challenges varies depending on the nature of the offence. The prosecutor and the accused are each allowed: twenty challenges for first-degree murder or high treason; twelve challenges for any offence, except first-degree murder or high treason, where a term of imprisonment exceeding five years is a possible sentence, and; four challenges where the accused is charged with a lesser offence (s. 634 (2), Criminal Code of Canada). 

Where multiple offences are tried together, the greatest number applicable is used (i.e., in an offence involving first-degree murder and armed robbery, the accused and the prosecutor are each entitled to twenty peremptory challenges) [s. 634 (3), Criminal Code of Canada]. 

When multiple accused are tried together, each accused is entitled to the same number that they would receive if tried separately, while the prosecutor has as many challenges as the total number available to all of the accused (i.e., in a case wherein two co-accused are charged with first-degree murder, each receives twenty peremptory challenges, and the prosecutor receives forty) [s. 634 (4), Criminal Code of Canada].

The amount of peremptory challenges can also vary according to the circumstances of the jury. The prosecutor and the accused are each entitled to one additional peremptory challenge if there are 13 jurors, or two additional challenges each in the case of 14 jurors (s. 634 (2.01), Criminal Code of Canada). As well, the number of peremptory challenges increases accordingly if the judge makes an order for alternate jurors at a rate of one additional challenge for each party per alternate juror (s. 634 (2.1), Criminal Code of Canada). In the event that replacement jurors are required, each party is similarly entitled to one peremptory challenge per replacement (s. 634 (2.2) Criminal Code of Canada). 


'''Challenge for Cause'''
Section 638 of the Criminal Code of Canada provides the basis upon which an individual juror may be challenged for cause.  A party seeking to challenge a prospective juror’s partiality must first demonstrate to the court that there is an ‘air of reality’ to the application (see R v Sherratt, [1991] 1 SCR 509).  A party may do this by establishing that there is a realistic potential for partiality (see R v Williams, [1998] 1 SCR 1128). 
 
Section 640 of the Criminal Code sets out the procedures for dealing with a challenge for cause.  A challenge for cause based on the enumerated grounds under section 638, other than the juror’s name not appearing on the panel, will be tried by the last two jurors to be sworn.  If no Jurors have been sworn the judge will appoint two persons to try the challenge for cause.  Upon application by the accused, the court may exercise its discretion to exclude all sworn and unsworn jurors from the court room until the challenge for cause is decided.  The two triers of the challenge for cause must decide the question on a balance of probabilities.  

'''Pre-Hearing Conference''' 
Part XX of the ''Criminal Code of Canada'' provides for Procedure in Jury Trials. 
Section 625.1 of the ''Criminal Code of Canada'' is the authority for a pre-hearing conference. 

A pre-hearing conference is a conference held prior to the beginning of a trial. It is held between the prosecutor and the accused (or counsel for the accused) and is presided over by the court. The purpose of a pre-hearing conference is to promote a fair and expeditious trial. It considers matters that would be better decided before the start of the trial and makes arrangements for the decisions of those matters. 

Either the prosecutor, defence or the judge may initiate a motion for a pre-hearing conference. 

A pre-hearing conference is '''mandatory''' for any case to be tried by jury (per s. 625.1(2) of the Criminal Code of Canada). It must be presided over by a judge of the court that will try the accused, and must be held in accordance with the rules of court made under sections 482 and 482.1. 

Case Law: A pre-hearing conference judge does not have the jurisdiction to review the Crown disclosure decisions or to order disclosure&lt;ref&gt;'''''R v S (S.S.)'' (1999), 136 CCC (3d) 477 (Ont SCJ''')&lt;/ref&gt; .

==Death qualification==
{{Main|Death-qualified jury}}
In the [[United States]], capital cases (cases where the prosecution pursues the death penalty), the jury must often be "death-qualified". A death-qualified jury is one in which all members of the venire that categorically object to [[capital punishment]] are removed. This has the effect of ensuring that the jury will be willing to hand down a sentence of death, if they feel the crime warrants it. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] has ruled that the practice is constitutional.  Critics object to death-qualification because empirical evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Samuel Gross|title=The Risks of Death: Why Erroneous Convictions Are Common in Capital Cases|publisher=44 Buffalo L. Rev. 469, 494|year=1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that death-qualified jurors are more likely to convict defendants of crimes than are jurors generally.

==Assistance of experts==
{{Main|Scientific jury selection|Jury research}}
In the 1970s and 1980s in the United States, [[scientific jury selection]]&amp;mdash;the use of expert assistance to more effectively use peremptory challenges &amp;mdash; became more common. The practice has proven controversial because of fears that it gives lawyers the ability to "fix" the jury and enhances the distorting effect of money. However, research indicates that the effect of the practice is modest at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=73|publisher=Judicature|pages=178|date=1989–1990|title=Scientific Jury Selection: What Social Scientists Know and Do Not Know|author=Diamond, Shari Seidman|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/judica73&amp;section=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the more generic jury consulting or [[jury research]] is increasingly more common as attorneys trying high-stakes cases demand assistance through all parts of the trial process. The still more generic field of [[trial consulting]] also contains a myriad of other tools and techniques not directly related to juries.

==Criticism{{anchor|Jury packing}}&lt;!--[[Jury packing]] redirects here--&gt;==
''Jury packing'' is "illegally or corruptly influencing a jury by making available for jury service persons known to be biased or partial in a particular case to be tried".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jury-packing|title=Jury-packing|work=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term also is applied pejoratively to jury selection procedures which are legal but perceived as unfair. In the nineteenth century, the prosecution had unlimited peremptory challenges in England and Ireland, whereas the defence were limited to six in England or 20 in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Howlin |first=Níamh |year=2009 |title=Controlling Jury Composition in Nineteenth-Century Ireland |journal=The Journal of Legal History |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=227–261: fn.152 |issn=0144-0365 |doi=10.1080/01440360903353955 |url=http://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/handle/10197/4258/NiamhHowlin_Controlling_Jury_Composition_[ppp].pdf#page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter O'Brien, 1st Baron O'Brien|Peter O'Brien]] as [[Crown Prosecutor]] during the [[Irish Land War]] was nicknamed "Peter the Packer" by supporters of the [[Irish Land League]].  The pool from which a jury panel is selected may not have the same demographics as the general population; until the nineteenth century or later in many jurisdictions, jury service, [[history of suffrage|as with the electoral franchise]], was restricted to male property owners.

== Breed background ==
The [[Malinois dog|Belgian Malinois]], a working class dog, can be employed for personal protection and scent tracking. They must receive [[Obedience training|training]] so they can channel their high energy drive tasks that their owners have given them. When Belgian Malinois are young, they require a lot of stimuli from their surroundings so that they can get used to them as they grow older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.malinoisclub.com/abmc/about-malinois/faqs/|title=FAQs – ABMC|website=www.malinoisclub.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belgian Malinois &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/belgian-malinois#overview|title=Belgian Malinois Breed Information|work=Vetstreet|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;is a Belgian herding breed that originated from a small town in Belgium called Malines. The other name for a Belgian Malinois is the Chien de Berger (bair-zhai) Belge (belzh). This lively and energetic breed can be family friendly with the proper training and care. It can suffer from health problems, like most other breeds. Retinal atrophy, hip/elbow dysplasia, etc. Because of its energy an intelligence, the breed was enlisted in World War I.

Rhinoceros poaching has “increased from 13 poached rhinos in 2007 to 1,215 in 2014” (BBC News). Kruger National Park, however, has enlisted the help of a special Belgian Malinois, Killer. Alongside Killer's handler, Amos Mzimba, Killer has aided in the arrests of more than 115 rhinoceros poachers illegally hunting within the park grounds. 

== Awards ==
The [[PDSA Gold Medal]] was awarded to K9 Killer in January 2016 for his fight against [[Poaching|anti-poaching]] in [[South Africa]]. Through the protection of human and non-human life, pets must show dedication to their duties in order to receive this honor.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The '''Lahore Declaration''' was a [[bilateral agreement]] and governance treaty between [[Republic of India|India]] and [[Islamic Republic of Pakistan|Pakistan]]. The treaty was signed on 21 February 1999, at the conclusion of a historic summit in [[Lahore]], and ratified by the parliaments of both countries the same year.&lt;ref name="LD"&gt;[http://www.usip.org/files/file/resources/collections/peace_agreements/ip_lahore19990221.pdf The Lahore Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the terms of the treaty, a mutual understanding was reached towards the development of atomic arsenals and to avoid accidental and unauthorised operational use of nuclear weapons. The Lahore Declaration brought added responsibility to both nations' leadership towards avoiding [[nuclear race]], as well as both non-conventional and conventional conflicts. This event was significant in the history of Pakistan and it provided both countries an environment of mutual [[Confidence-building|confidence]]. In a much-covered televised press conference in both countries, Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] and Prime Minister [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] signed the treaty. It was the second nuclear control treaty signed by both countries and pledged to continue the use of the first treaty, [[Non-Nuclear Aggression Agreement|NNAA]], was signed in 1988. The Lahore treaty was quickly ratified by the parliaments of [[Indian Parliament|India]] and [[Pakistan Parliament|Pakistan]] and came into force the same year.

The Lahore Declaration signalled a major breakthrough in overcoming the [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts|historically strained]] [[History of India and Pakistan|bilateral relations]] between the [[India and Pakistan|two nations]] in the aftermath of the publicly performed [[atomic test]]s carried out by both nations in May 1998. Widely popular in the public circles in Pakistan and hailed by the [[United Nations|international community]], the relations would soon lose impetus with the outbreak of the controversial [[Kargil War|Kargil debacle]] in May 1999.

==Overview==

The Lahore treaty was one of the most important and historical treaties of India and Pakistan to normalise the relations to ease up the military tensions in South Asia. In 1972, the [[Shimla Agreement|Shimla Treaty]] was acceded to establish peaceful relations in the aftermath of the disastrous [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|war]] in 1971 and committed both nations to resolving bilateral disputes by peaceful dialogue and co-operation.  In 1978, Pakistan made a proposal to limit the [[nuclear race]] between two countries and to establish South Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone (SANWFZ), for which negotiations were never concluded.

In 1988, Pakistan and India reached an important understanding towards controlling the nuclear weapons, and signed the [[Non-Nuclear agression agreement|NNAA]] treaty. Despite many proposals, the nuclear race continued and the cold war had been heightened over the issue of [[Kashmir]]. The domestic pressure and the increasingly political momentum, India conducted the nuclear tests (see: [[Pokhran-II|Operation Shakti]]) on May 1998, in spite of international pressure. Responding to India's test, Pakistan equalised the nuclear magnitude in South Asia after performing its own series of atomic tests, (see: [[Chagai-I]]), all in the end month of May 1998.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/India/IndiaShakti.html Shakti tests]&lt;/ref&gt; The tests invited condemnation and economic sanctions on both countries and many fear in the international community that in a wake of intensified conflict, it could lead to [[nuclear war]].

===Negotiations===

In 1998, the Foreign ministries of both countries had been initiating peace process to ease up the tension in the region. On 23 September 1998 both governments signed an agreement recognising the principle of building an environment of peace and security and resolving all bilateral conflicts, which became the basis of the Lahore Declaration.&lt;ref name="LD"/&gt; On 11 February 1999, the Pakistan [[Foreign Office of Pakistan|Foreign Office]] announced the state visit of Indian Prime minister [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] aboard the maiden bus service between the two countries.&lt;ref name="Dawn Wire Services, 13 1999"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hasan Akhtar|title=Nawaz-Vajpayee agenda includes Kashmir, N-issue|url=http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/SAserials/Dawn/1999/13Feb99.html#nawa|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=Dawn Wire Services, 13 1999|date=13 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the arrival of Indian Prime Minister, a warm welcome awaited Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee when he arrived at Wagah by the inaugural bus service between New Delhi and Lahore.&lt;ref name="Dawn Wire Service 1999"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ashraf Mumtaz|title=Vajpayee arrives today: Open-ended agenda for summit|url=http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/SAserials/Dawn/1999/20Feb99.html#vajp|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=Dawn Wire Service 1999|date=19 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was received by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and the units of [[Pakistan Army]] gave the Indian Prime minister a [[guard of honour]].&lt;ref name="Dawn Wire Service 1999"/&gt; It embarked on a historic visit to Pakistan, travelling on the [[Delhi-Lahore Bus|inaugural bus service]] connecting the Indian capital of New Delhi with the major Pakistani city of [[Lahore]], establishing a major transport link for the peoples of both nations.&lt;ref name="Dawn Wire Service 1999"/&gt; The inaugural bus also carried Indian celebrities and dignitaries such as [[Dev Anand]], [[Satish Gujral]], [[Javed Akhtar]], [[Kuldip Nayar]], [[Kapil Dev]], [[Shatrughan Sinha]] and [[Mallika Sarabhai]].&lt;ref name="VQ"&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/feb/20bus1.htm Vajpayee drives across the border into Pakistan and history]&lt;/ref&gt; He was received amidst great fanfare and media attention at the Pakistani border post of [[Wagah]] by Pakistan Prime minister Nawaz Sharif, with whom he had been at loggerheads a year before over the nuclear tests controversy. The summit was hailed worldwide as a major breakthrough and milestone in bilateral relations and a historic step towards ending conflict and tensions in the region.&lt;ref name="VQ"/&gt;

===Drafting and Signatures===

The Lahore declaration is one notable treaty after the 1988 [[Non-Nuclear agression agreement|NNAA treaty]] and the 1972 [[Simla agreement|Shimla Treaty]].&lt;ref name="Much Thanks to NTI for providing the text"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lahore Declaration|title=Lahore Declaration|url=http://www.nti.org/treaties-and-regimes/lahore-declaration/|work=Governments of India and Pakistan|publisher=Much Thanks to NTI for providing the text|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the two Prime ministers signed the agreement, the foreign secretaries of [[Foreign Secretary (Pakistan)|Pakistan]] [[Shamshad Ahmad]] and [[Indian Foreign Secretary|India]] K. Raghunath signed an [[Memorandum of Understanding|MoU]] on 21 February 1999, identifying measures aimed at promoting an environment of peace and security between the two countries.&lt;ref name="Much Thanks to NTI for providing the text"/&gt; The MOU reaffirmed the continued commitment of their respective governments to the principles and purposes of the [[United Nations|UN Charter]].&lt;ref name="Much Thanks to NTI for providing the text"/&gt;

The MoU reiterated the determination of both countries to implementing the Simla Agreement in letter and spirit; and that an environment of peace and security is in the national interest of both countries and that resolution of all outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, is essential for this purpose.&lt;ref name="Much Thanks to NTI for providing the text"/&gt; The parliaments of both countries quickly ratified and acceded the treaties following the signatures.&lt;ref name="Much Thanks to NTI for providing the text"/&gt;

==Content==
The Lahore Declaration was signed on 21 February along with a [[memorandum of understanding]] (MoU) after three rounds of talks between the Indian and Pakistani leaders.&lt;ref name="LD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RN"&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/feb/21bus.htm Vajpayee, Sharief sign Lahore Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt; In its content, both governments asserted their commitment to the vision of peace, stability and mutual progress and their full commitment to the Shimla Agreement and the [[Charter of the United Nations|UN Charter]]. Both governments recognised through the Lahore Declaration that the development of nuclear weapons brought added responsibility to both nations towards avoiding conflict and promoted the importance of [[Confidence-building measures]], especially to avoid accidental and unauthorised use of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name="LD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RN"/&gt; India and Pakistan also decided to give each other advance notification of [[ballistic missile]] flight tests and accidental or unexplained use of nuclear weapons to avoid the outbreak of a nuclear conflict.&lt;ref name="RN"/&gt; Its important ''inter alia'' stated:

**Recognizes that the nuclear dimension of the security environment of the two countries adds to their responsibility for avoidance of conflict between them.&lt;ref name="Thanks much to CNS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Press|title=Lahore Declaration Text|url=http://cns.miis.edu/inventory/pdfs/aptlahore.pdf|work=Governments of India and Pakistan|publisher=Thanks much to CNS|accessdate=15 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025003245/http://cns.miis.edu/inventory/pdfs/aptlahore.pdf|archivedate=25 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
**Commits both to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, and the universally accepted principles of [[peaceful co-existence]].&lt;ref name="Thanks much to CNS"/&gt;
**Commits both countries to the objectives of universal nuclear disarmament and [[Nuclear Proliferation Treaty|nonproliferation]].&lt;ref name="Thanks much to CNS"/&gt;

The Lahore Declaration and the MoU incorporated a joint commitment to intensify efforts to resolve the [[Kashmir conflict]] and other dispute, to enhance bilateral dialogue and to implement nuclear safeguards and measures to prevent conflict. Both governments condemned terrorism and committed to non-interference in each other's internal affairs and the objectives of the [[South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation]] and promote human rights.&lt;ref name="LD"/&gt;

In the joint statement issued after the conclusion of the summit, both governments said that their [[foreign minister]]s would meet periodically and consult each other on issues pertaining to the [[World Trade Organization]] and information technology.&lt;ref name="Much Thanks to NTI for providing the text" /&gt; A two-member ministerial committee was to be established to investigate human rights issues, civilian detainees and missing [[prisoners of war]]. The Indian Prime Minister thanked his Pakistani counterpart and issued an invitation for a future summit in India.&lt;ref name="LD"/&gt;

==Public debates and Reactions==

===Pakistan public and media opinion===

{{Main|News channels in Pakistan}}
The Lahore treaty was very popular in Pakistan's [[Pakistani society|civil society]] sphere.&lt;ref name="Dawn Wire Service 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Story of Pakistan (Ateam Developments)"/&gt; The general population polls were widely welcomed this move by the Nawaz Sharif Government to normalise relations with India.&lt;ref name="Story of Pakistan (Ateam Developments)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=The Lahore Declaration|url=http://storyofpakistan.com/the-lahore-declaration/|publisher=Story of Pakistan (Ateam Developments)|accessdate=15 February 2013|date=1 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news channels, television outlets, and print media widely hailed this move by the Government of Nawaz Sharif to normalise relations with India. Except [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|''JI'']], the far-right [[Right-wing populism|party]] was critical of this treaty; all major political forces in Pakistan, including [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]], hailed and congratulated Nawaz Sharif for successfully reaching the Lahore treaty.&lt;ref name="Dawn Wire Service 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Story of Pakistan (Ateam Developments)"/&gt;

However, it was speculated in the Pakistan's news media that many in [[Pakistan military]] did not approve of the treaty and consequently worked to subvert it and escalate tensions between the two nations.&lt;ref name="ITA"&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/1999/99apr04/j&amp;k.htm#1 Tribune India]&lt;/ref&gt; The reception for Vajpayee, described as the leader of an "enemy-combatant nation," was boycotted by the chiefs of Pakistan military, and those included the [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman joint chiefs]] and [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|army chief]] General [[Pervez Musharaff]], [[Chief of Air Staff (Pakistan)|air chief]] [[Air Chief Marshal|ACM]] [[Parvaiz Mehdi Qureshi|PQ Mehdi]] and [[Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan)|naval chief]] Admiral [[Fasih Bokhari]].&lt;ref name="BV"/&gt; A terrorist attacks claimed the lives of civilians continued even as the summit was about to take place.&lt;ref name="BV"&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/feb/20bus2.htm Pakistani military chiefs boycott welcome]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LI"&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/feb/20kash.htm 20 Hindu villagers gunned down in Kashmir]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian public and media opinion===

{{Main|News channels in india}}
The Lahore Declaration was hailed warmly in India and in the global media and by governments of other nations, forging optimism after the global tensions over the 1998 nuclear tests.&lt;ref name="VQ"/&gt; The initiative bolstered the popularity of the Vajpayee government in India, cementing his standing as a statesman.&lt;ref name="VQ"/&gt;

==Aftermath and status==

The relations between the two nations were completely transformed at the outbreak of the [[Kargil War]] in May 1999, following the sudden revelation that Pakistani soldiers had infiltrated into [[Indian-administered Kashmir|Indian Administered Kashmir]];&lt;ref name="IT"&gt;[http://www.india-today.com/itoday/07061999/cover.html Kargil War; Blasting Peace] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/65xyd3AN4?url=http://www.india-today.com/itoday/07061999/cover.html |date= 6 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;[http://www.weeklyvoice.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1443&amp;Itemid=66 Musharraf Vs.

The conflict was followed by an [[Atlantique incident]] in which the [[Indian Air Force]] intercept and shot down the [[Pakistan Navy]]'s reconnaissance aircraft; a total of eleven naval personnel were killed. After months of contentious relations with the military and judiciary, a [[1999 Pakistani coup d'état|military coup d'état]] was staged by [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] that overthrew the Government of Nawaz Sharif and brought the chairman joint chiefs General Pervez Musharraf, believed to be responsible for the Kargil incursion,&lt;ref name="PR"/&gt; to power, thus exacerbating doubts over the future of the relations between the two nations.&lt;ref name="PR"/&gt; Despite many political difficulties, India reiterated the necessity of implementing the Simla and Lahore treaties and said India would support the Simla Agreement, Lahore Declaration, and the issue of cross-border terrorism.&lt;ref name="Much Thanks to NTI for providing the text" /&gt;

'''Legal Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance or "LGRC"''', refers to the complex set of processes, rules, tools and systems used by corporate legal departments to adopt, implement and monitor an integrated approach to business problems.
While [[Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance]] refers to a generalized set of tools for managing a corporation or company, Legal GRC, or LGRC, refers to a specialized – but similar – set of [http://ro.ecu.edu.au/adf/171/ tools]&lt;ref&gt;Adams, R., Mann, G., &amp; Hobbs, V. (2017). ISEEK, a tool for high speed, concurrent, distributed forensic data acquisition''. Paper presented in Valli, C. (Ed.).'' ''The Proceedings of 15th Australian Digital Forensics Conference 5-6 December 2017, Edith Cowan University, Perth, Australia''&lt;/ref&gt; utilized by attorneys, corporate legal departments, general counsel and law firms to govern themselves and their corporations, especially but not exclusively in relation to the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/techexec/2007/0507techexec1.html Musthaler, Linda and Brian. Governance, risk management and compliance and what it means to you. Network World, March 7, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Other specializations within the realm of governance, risk management and compliance include IT GRC and financial GRC. Within these three realms, there is a great deal of overlap, particularly in large corporations that have legal and IT departments, as well as financial departments.

==Legal governance==

'''Legal governance''' refers to the establishment, execution and interpretation of processes and rules put in place by corporate legal departments in order to ensure a smoothly-run legal department and corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dciginc.com/2008/01/interview-with-stephen-whetstone-pt1.html Konkle, Joshua L. Legal risk management requires a corporate strategy, mindset and commitment. DCIG,January 9, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal risk management==

'''Legal risk management''' refers to the process of evaluating alternative regulatory and non-regulatory responses to risk and selecting among them. Even with the legal realm, this process requires knowledge of the legal, economic and social factors, as well as knowledge of the business world in which legal teams operate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fusrapmaywood.com/factsheet/gloss.htm US Army Corps of Engineers Glossary. August 1998.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120132402/http://www.fusrapmaywood.com/factsheet/gloss.htm |date=2008-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an organizational setting, risk management refers to the process by which an organization sets the risk tolerance, identifies potential risks and prioritizes the tolerance for risk based on the organization’s business objectives, and manages and mitigates risks throughout the organization.

==Legal compliance==

'''Legal compliance''' is the process or procedure to ensure that an organization follows relevant laws, regulations and business rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmsbvi.k12.nm.us/Records/records_def.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205103206/http://www.nmsbvi.k12.nm.us/Records/records_def.htm |archivedate=2008-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of legal compliance, especially in the context of corporate legal departments, has recently been expanded to include understanding and adhering to ethical codes within entire professions, as well. There are two requirements for an enterprise to be compliant with the law, first its policies need to be consistent with the law.  Second, its policies need to be complete with respect to the law.
The role of legal compliance has also been expanded to include self-monitoring the non-governed behavior with industries and corporations that could lead to workplace indiscretions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4153/is_3_61/ai_n6153200 Bauer, Christopher. An ethics self-exam: ethical compliances is not just an issue for external review; auditors must look inward to ensure their own integrity is not compromised. Bnet, June 2004.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218141809/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4153/is_3_61/ai_n6153200 |date=2007-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within the LGRC realm, it is important to keep in mind that if a strong legal governance component is in place, risk can be accurately assessed and the monitoring of legal compliance be carried out efficiently. It is also important to realize that within the LGRC framework, legal teams work closely with executive teams and other business departments to align their goals and ensure proper communication.

===Legal Consistency===

'''Legal Consistency''' is a property that declares enterprise policies to be free of contradictions with the law. '''Legal Consistency'''  has been defined as not having multiple verdicts for the same case  &lt;ref&gt;International Law and International Relations: An International  Organization Reader. By Beth A. Simmons, Richard H. Steinberg Contributor Beth A. Simmons, Richard H. Steinberg Edition: illustrated Published by Cambridge University Press, 
2007. {{ISBN|0-521-86186-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-86186-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
. The antonym '''Legal Inconsistency'''  is defined as having two rule that contradict each other.&lt;ref&gt;Legisprudence: A New Theoretical Approach to Legislation : Proceedings of the Fourth Benelux-Scandinavian Symposium on Legal Theory By Luc Wintgens Contributor Luc Wintgens Edition: illustrated Published by Hart Publishing, 1998 {{ISBN|1-84113-342-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-84113-342-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common definitions of consistency refer to “treating  similar cases alike”.&lt;ref&gt;Law and justice in the courts of classical Athens By Adriaan Lanni Published by Cambridge University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-521-85759-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-85759-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the enterprise context, legal consistency  refers to “obedience to the law”.&lt;ref&gt;The Measurement of Moral Judgment By Anne Colby, Lawrence Kohlberg Contributor Lawrence Kohlberg Edition: illustrated Published by CUP Archive, 1987 {{ISBN|0-521-32501-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-32501-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of legal requirements validation, legal consistency is defined as, " Enterprise requirements are legally consistent if they adhere to the legal requirements and include no contradictions."&lt;ref name="WaelHassan"&gt;Hassan, Waël. PhD Thesis.  University of Ottawa. University of Ottawa Press. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal Completeness===

'''Legal Completeness''' is a property that declares enterprise policies to cover all scenarios included or suggested by the law. Completeness suggests that there are no scenarios covered by the law that cannot be implemented in the enterprise.  In addition, it implies that all scenarios not allowed by the law are not allowed by the enterprise.

Enterprise policies are said to be legally complete if they contain no gaps in the legal sense. Completeness can be thought of in two ways:&lt;ref&gt;Armour, J. Share Capital and Creditor Protection: Efficient Rules for a 
Modern Company Law. ESRC Centre for Business Research - Working Papers wp148, ESRC Centre for Business Research. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars make use of a concept of ‘obligational’ completeness such as Ayres and Gertner.&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, Ian and Gertner, Robert (1992), ‘Strategic Contractual Inefficiency and the Optimal Choice of Legal Rules’, 101 Yale Law Journal 729&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to this usage, a system or a contract is ‘obligationally’ complete if it specifies what each party is to do in every situation, even if this is not the optimal action to take under some circumstances. Others discuss ‘enforceability’ completeness in the sense that failing to specify key terms can lead a court to characterize a system as being too uncertain to enforce (May &amp; Butcher v the King 1934),&lt;ref&gt;Cases and Materials on Contracts By S. M. Waddams, Waddams, S. M., 1942-, Waddams, Trebilcock, mccamus, Neyers, Waldron Edition: 3 Published by Emond  Montgomery Publication, 2005 {{ISBN|1-55239-166-3}}, {{ISBN|978-1-55239-166-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence a system may be complete with respect to enforceability. This leads to the following definition: enterprise regulations or requirements are legally complete if it specifies what each party is to do in each situation while covering all gaps in the legal sense.&lt;ref name="WaelHassan" /&gt;

==History==

Lebogang says.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110530070924/http://220.72.21.21/pub/docu/kr/AA/04/AA042007SAF/AA04-2007-SAF-001.PDF Kim, Won-Kyu. The effect of industrial restructuring policy post-financial crisis. September/October 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] act, legal industry [[thought leaders]] saw a need for a new framework for legal GRC, and borrowed heavily from IT, RIM and other industries to try to come up with new, clear processes and rules to make navigating the choppy waters of the post-financial crisis legal world go as smoothly as possible.

==Organizations==

===Legal GRC Center for Innovation===

The Legal GRC Center for Innovation is a nonprofit institute for the advancement of the concepts and applications of Legal GRC. The LGRC Center for Innovation serves as a forum for legal industry leaders to discuss and determine ways to systematize and streamline within the legal industry. The membership of the LGRC-CFI is made up of a group of [thought leaders] in the legal, business, IT, and RIM fields. They meet in online forums and at periodic conventions and summits to determine [[best practices]] for Legal GRC. The LGRC-CFI also publishes a [[blog]] and several industry-specific [[white papers]] regularly. The LGRC Center for Innovation addresses legal governance, risk management, and compliance exclusively.

===Institute on Governance===

The [[Institute on Governance]] (IOG), although it does not address LGRC exclusively, is a useful resource for knowledge on governance in general, and has collected some significant basics about legal governance online.
The IOG is an independent, Canadian, nonprofit [think tank] founded in 1990 to promote better governance for public benefit. Through our research and services we help public organizations and societies realize their objectives by putting [[good governance]] into practice.

===Association of Corporate Counsel===

The [[Association of Corporate Counsel]] ("ACC"), formerly the American Corporate Counsel Association ("ACCA"), is an association of in-house counsel, [[Lawyer|attorneys]] who work for [[corporations]]. The association publishes the magazine ACC Docket and arranges one of the United States’ largest annual meetings for in-house attorneys. ACC was founded in 1982. It currently has more than 24,000 members from over 10,500 corporations in 77 countries.[1]
The ACC does not address LGRC exclusively, but can be credited with laying some foundations for corporations – the original practitioners of governance, risk management, and compliance – and legal departments to begin to work together on overarching issues of governance, risk management, and compliance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In 2009, President Obama appointed Rogers to serve as the chair of his Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, a panel of faith and civic leaders from different religious and political backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/white-house-names-new-faith-based-office-director-91781/|title=White House Names New Faith-Based Office Director|work=Christian Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/pastor-and-rabbi-agree-melissa-roberts-is-good-choice-for-white-house-faith-office/2013/03/13/dfb4dfae-8bea-11e2-9f54-f3fdd70acad2_story.html|title=Pastor and rabbi agree: Melissa Rogers is good choice for White House faith office|author=Rev.

The First Freedom Center gave Rogers its First Freedom Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstfreedom.org/PDF/2010%20Awards%20Gala.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2011 she was named to a subgroup of the State Department’s Religion and Foreign Policy Working Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bjconline.org/white-house-official-speaks-at-2014-rlc-luncheon/|title=White House official speaks at 2014 RLC Luncheon|work=Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before her appointment, Rogers had been critical of the Obama administration’s handling of some church-state issues in an interview with the Huffington Post with respect to the Affordable Care Act’s contraception mandate.  She stated that the administration erred in only exempting houses of worship from the ACA’s requirement that employers include contraception coverage in their health insurance policies. Her ideas later became the basis for the administration’s accommodation of the interests of a wider set of religious entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obamas-breach-of-faith-over-contraceptive-ruling/2012/01/29/gIQAY7V5aQ_story.html|title=Obama’s breach of faith over contraceptive ruling|author=E.J.

In 2014, the Baptist Joint Committee gave Rogers its J.M. Dawson Religious Liberty Award.   In 2015, Rogers continued to lead the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/white-house-looks-to-curb-anti-muslim-sentiment/article/2578316 "White House looks to curb anti-Muslim sentiment"]. ''Washington Examiner'', Dec 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

After a Sikh man in California was attacked and severely injured, Rogers represented the Obama administration at his house of worship in Rockville, Maryland, where she spoke out against hate crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/10/27/isis-terrorist-lets-get-him-sikh-mans-attacker-found-guilty-of-hate-crime/ "‘ISIS.

The '''Official Language Act''' of 1974&lt;ref&gt;''Official Language Act'', S.Q. 1974, s. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[French language|French]] ''Loi sur la langue officielle''), also known as '''Bill 22''', was an act of the [[National Assembly of Quebec]], commissioned by Premier [[Robert Bourassa]], which made [[French language|French]] the sole [[official language]] of [[Quebec]], Canada. Provincial desire for the Official Language Act came after the repeal of [[Bill 63]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hudon|first=R|title=Bill 22|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/bill-22|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica-Dominion|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was ultimately supplanted by the [[Charter of the French Language]] (also known as Bill 101) in 1977, which imposed French as the only language for advertising and education (with many exceptions).&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.canlii.org/en/qc/laws/stat/rsq-c-c-11/latest/rsq-c-c-11.html Charter of the French Language]'', RSQ, c. C-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation was drafted in an attempt to follow the recommendations of the [[Commission of Inquiry on the Situation of the French Language and Linguistic Rights in Quebec]]. The act made French the official language in a number of areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speaking out: Quebec's debate over language laws|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/bill-22|work=CBC News|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter of the French Language, RSQ, c C-11|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/qc/laws/stat/rsq-c-c-11/latest/rsq-c-c-11.html|work=CanLii|publisher=Canadian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Language of services (must be primarily offered in French)
*Language of commercial signing (the use of French was required)
*Language of labour relations and business (businesses wanting to deal with the state had to apply for francization programs)
*Language of instruction (English-language public school was restricted to children who had a "sufficient" knowledge of this language)
*Language of legislation and justice (priority was given to French texts in case of ambiguity)


==Objections to Bill 22==

That English was an official language in Quebec as well, was declared on July 19, 1974, by [[McGill University]] law faculty's most expert counsellors, disputing Bill 22. The testifiers were Dean [[F. R. Scott|Frank R. Scott]], [[John Peters Humphrey]], chief planner of the United Nations' [[Declaration of Human Rights]], [[Irwin Cotler]] and four additional legal teachers:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=William|title=English-speaking Quebecers must wake up and defend their rights|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=9f05bde7-f404-4065-9d97-b1c68fdb264a&amp;p=1|accessdate=27 January 2012|newspaper=Montreal Gazette|date=31 August 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924012716/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=9f05bde7-f404-4065-9d97-b1c68fdb264a&amp;p=1|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Section 1, which provides that French is 'the official language of the province of Quebec,' is misleading in that it suggests that English is not also an official language in Quebec, which it is by virtue of Section 133 of the [[BNA Act]] and the federal [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]].&amp;nbsp;... No legislation in the National Assembly proclaiming French the sole official language in the province can affect these bilingual areas protected by the BNA Act.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Ciaccia and George Springate were suspended from the Liberal caucus for almost two months in 1974 for voting with the Opposition when the Robert Bourassa government passed Bill 22.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-longtime-quebec-liberal-john-ciaccia-dies-at-85-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24615">A '''patent box''' is a special tax regime used by several countries to incentivise research and development by taxing [[intellectual property|patent]] revenues differently from other commercial revenues. It is also known as '''intellectual property box regime''', innovation box or '''IP box'''.

==History==
In the early 1970s Ireland introduced the first scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardinal-ip.com/ip-news-strategy/the-patent-box/|title=The Patent Box|publisher=Cardinal-ip.com|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in its [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Seán Lemass and after|Corporation Tax]]. Section 34 of the 1973 Finance Act allowed total tax relief in respect of royalties and other income from licenses patented in Ireland. 

The concept was applied in 2001 by the French Tax Authorities as a reduced rate of tax on revenue from IP licensing or the transfer of qualified IP.&lt;ref&gt;ftp.zew.de/pub/zew-docs/dp/dp13070.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Within Europe, Belgium, Hungary, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom have also introduced similar schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neocleous.com/assets/modules/neo/publications/1592/docs/Global_Tax_Weekly.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916035601/http://neocleous.com/assets/modules/neo/publications/1592/docs/Global_Tax_Weekly.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The Irish Patent Box system is one of the key benefits for companies paying Irish corporation tax. The system was criticised by [[Lionel Jospin]] in the early 2000s and more recently by both the EU (Ecofin assessment 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belastingrechtaandevu.nl/Portals/0/images/140702_Sheets_panel2.pdf|format=PDF|title=EU and OECD aspects of IP-regimes|publisher=Belastingrechtaandevu.nl|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the OECD under its [[Base erosion and profit shifting (OECD project)|Base Erosion and Profit-Shifting (BEPS) project.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/financial-services/review-of-patent-tax-regimes-in-eu-has-irish-support-1.1905477|title=Review of patent tax regimes in EU has Irish support|work=Irish Times|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system has been key to attracting international IT companies to Ireland. The economic benefits of beneficial tax regimes for revenues from patents led to similar schemes being introduced in France in 2000 and amended in 2005 &amp; 2010.

==Schemes by country==

===Cyprus===
IP box rules were changed in October 2016, valid since July 2016 - reduced the list of the qualified IP incomes, no patents nor trademarks anymore. 80% of income is exempted after deducting the real expenses, giving an effective tax rate of 2.5% or less.

===Ireland===
{{main article|Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland}}
The scheme which had existed since 1973 was withdrawn in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2012/02/16/00064.asp|title=Dáil Éireann - 16/Feb/2012 Written Answers - Tax Code|publisher=Debates.oireachtas.ie|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revenue.ie/en/press/budget/archive/2011/budget-2011-summary.pdf|format=PDF|title=BUDGET SUMMARY 2011 |publisher=Revenue.ie|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the National recovery Plan 2011-2015 of the Republic of Ireland. It exempted revenue from qualifying Patents from Irish corporation tax. The exemption is to be replaced by a “[[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Knowledge development box|Knowledge Development Box]]” in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/budget-2015-new-knowledge-box-tax-incentive-scheme-to-be-targeted-in-eu-probe-30671379.html|title=Budget 2015: New 'knowledge box' tax incentive scheme to be targeted in EU probe|work=Independent.ie|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-10-15/goodbye-double-irish-hello-knowledge-box|title=Goodbye Double Irish, Hello Knowledge Box|author=Leonid Bershidsky|work=BloombergView.com|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering a reduced tax rate of 6.25% on qualifying profits generated in periods commencing on or after 1 January 2016.

The key difference in the Irish KDB to those of other European countries is its compliance with the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New Knowledge Box will help increase investment into Ireland – Budget Statement|url = http://www.idaireland.com/newsroom/budget-statement/|website = www.idaireland.com|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; programme, Ireland’s is the first patent-box type system to offer compliance in this area. Companies availing of the current R&amp;D tax credit should be aware of the KDB and the potential for them to take advantage of both systems.

===France===
Introduced in 1979&lt;ref&gt;Code général des impôts Légifrance&lt;/ref&gt; the Patents and royalties regime allows companies paying French corporation tax to pay a reduced rate of 15% (instead of 33%) on patent and royalties income&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifiscal.fr/fiche-pratique/imposition-benefices/calcul-resultat-fiscal.html|title=Calcul résultat fiscal impot société is LégiFiscal|publisher=Legifiscal.fr|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they are treated as a long term capital gain. If the licensee is a French corporation and actually uses the qualified IP licensed, the licensee may deduct the royalty payments from its income taxable at the standard 33.33% rate even if the licensor is taxed at the reduced 15% rate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jetro.go.jp/world/europe/ip/pdf/european_patent_box_regimes_en.pdf|title=European patent box regimes|publisher=Japan External Trade Organisation|accessdate=19 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226033009/http://www.jetro.go.jp/world/europe/ip/pdf/european_patent_box_regimes_en.pdf|archivedate=26 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
The Netherlands introduced a patent box tax regime referred to as the ‘innovation box’ in January 2007. This initial regime applied only to patents and applied a 10% rate of corporate tax. On 1 January 2010 the regime was expanded to include a much wider range of IP and the headline rate was reduced to 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://innovativetax.com/news/dutch-ip-innovation-box-effective-tax-rate-of-5-on-r-d-activities.html|title=Dutch IP Innovation Box: effective tax rate of 5% on R &amp; D activities|publisher=Innovativetax.com|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduced rate of corporate tax applies to the net positive income derived from the qualifying IP ( gross income minus all related expenses and depreciation).

===Belgium ===
The patent box scheme in Belgium was introduced in January 2007, and is known as a patent income deduction (PID). The last revision applies from July 2016. This PID allows a company, liable to pay Corporation Tax in Belgium, to deduct from its taxable income 85% of gross patent income. The remaining 15% of gross patent income is taxed at the standard corporation tax rate of 34% (including a 3% surtax). This results in an effective tax rate of 5.1% on the qualifying income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/blog/checkpoint/belgium-enacts-patent-box-incentive-regime/|title=Belgium Enacts Patent Box Incentive Regime|date=2017-02-28|work=Thomson Reuters Tax &amp; Accounting|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luxembourg===
The Luxembourg IP regime has been abolished. IP regimes claimed before July 2016 can still continue to benefit from the preferential rate for the next 5 years. It is expected that Luxembourg creates a new IP regime following the OECD criteria.

In Luxembourg IP regime became effective in January 2008 and amended in 2008 to also exclude qualifying IP assets from Luxembourg’s net wealth tax. The scheme applies to the net income derived from the use of qualifying intellectual property acquired or developed after December 2007. 80% of income is exempted, giving an effective tax rate of 5.76%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/invest-luxembourg/intellectual-property/index.html|title=Intellectual Property|publisher=Luxembourg.public.lu|accessdate=19 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018225721/http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/invest-luxembourg/intellectual-property/index.html|archivedate=18 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
Hungary introduced a scheme in 2003 including a provision according to which 50% of the pre-tax amount of the royalties received may be deducted from the tax base, this reducing the effective corporate tax rate on such royalties from 9% to 4.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itpa.org/?p=6640|title=The International Tax Planning Association Library – Hungary's New Position in the Royalty Planning Industry by Dr Willem G.

===Spain===
As of January 1, 2008, 50% of the gross income of Spanish domiciled companies derived from qualified Intellectual Property is exempt from Spain’s Corporation tax resulting in an effective tax rate of 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/washington-national-tax/assets/Merrill0326.pdf|format=PDF|title=Is It Time for the United States to Consider the Patent Box?|publisher=Pwc.com|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom introduced a Patent Box scheme in 2013 taxing qualifying IP at 10%.
The Patent Box in the UK is a tax incentive introduced in 2013 designed to encourage companies to make profits from their patents by reducing the UK tax paid on those profits.

====History====
The UK Patent Box went live in April 2013. The [[UK]] government wants to encourage high-value growth in [[Economy of the United Kingdom|UK plc]] through a competitive tax regime that supports UK [[R&amp;D]] from conception to commercialisation. The Patent Box forms a key part of this strategy by encouraging companies to ''commercialise'' their [[patents]] and R&amp;D in the UK. Other countries (eg.Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands) already operate schemes to provide incentives for companies to retain and commercialise existing patents

The scheme was first proposed in the 2009 Pre-Budget Report and went through various iterations and public consultations until final legislation was passed in the [[Finance Act]] 2012. The legislation is now formally a new Part 8A of the [[Corporation Tax Act 2010]] entitled "Profits Arising from the Exploitation of Patents etc". The Finance (No.2 Bill) 2015/16 includes proposed amendments, which, if implemented, will amend the patent box rules.

The Patent Box initiative is complementary to the R&amp;D tax incentives which encourage companies to ''undertake'' their R&amp;D in the UKhb

The Patent Box allows a 10% tax rate on [[profit (accounting)|profits]] derived from any products that incorporate patents. The net benefit for claiming companies is likely to be several percentage points of their corporate earnings, given that the main rate of [[UK corporation tax]] is 20 per cent.

The steady state cost, after the initial phasing- in period, of the Patent Box is forecast to be approximately £1.1 billion in terms of corporation tax revenues foregone by HM Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Budget 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim process is as follows:
*calculate qualifying income by identifying revenue streams from qualifying patents, 
*calculate the profit generated from this qualifying income, 
*then calculate residual profit by deducting routine profit made from routine business activities,
*then calculate the Patent box profit by deducting any profits derived from branding or marketing attributes
* then use the [[HMRC]] formula to calculate the corporate tax deduction.

====How to claim====
Companies must calculate their qualifying Patent Box profit and then apply a specific formula in their tax computation to calculate the deduction in their tax liability. Then they can take the tax deduction as a benefit in their CT600 tax return.
The formula to calculate the amount of the tax deduction is

 &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P} \mathbf{B} *\left ( \frac {MR-PBR} {MR} \right )&lt;/math&gt;
where 
*PB is the Patent Box profit for the company,
*MR is the main rate of corporation tax, and 
*PBR is the special Patent Box tax rate (10 per cent)

====Qualifying patents====
Qualifying patents must have been granted by an approved patent-granting body, including the [[UK Intellectual Property Office]], the [[European Patent Office]], and designated European territories:&lt;ref&gt;HMRC,[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/cirdmanual/CIRD210160.htm "CIRD Patent Box manual"] Retrieved 15 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UK Statutory Instrument 2013 No. 420 The Profits from Patents (EEA Rights) Order 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Austria; Bulgaria; the Czech republic; Denmark; Estonia; Finland; Germany; Hungary; Poland; Portugal; Romania; Slovakia and Sweden.

Currently, the Patent Box excludes patents registered in territories such as the USA, France, and Spain because of differences in the search and approval process for patent applications.

The Patent Box excludes products that only have [[copyright]] or [[trademark]] protection.

====Qualifying income====
There are five categories (“heads”) of qualifying income: 
*'''head 1''': worldwide income from the sale of products incorporating at least one embedded patent (and including income from sale of integral spare parts)
*'''head 2''': licence fees or [[royalties]] from qualifying [[Intellectual Property|IP]]
*'''head 3''': sale or disposal of qualifying IP and rights over qualifying IP 
*'''heads 4 &amp; 5''': damages/compensation income from infringement/loss of sales of qualifying IP rights

Income generated from exclusive licenses will be qualifying income on both sides of the agreement – i.e. for the licensor ''and'' the licensee – subject to specific conditions concerning the meaning of exclusivity.

“IP-derived income”, where patented products or processes are used in the manufacture or delivery of non-patented products or services, will be qualifying income to the extent of a notional royalty which values the specific patented product or process as a proportion of the value of the non-patented product or service.

====Qualifying company====
*must hold qualifying IP rights
*must elect into the scheme
*must fulfill “development” and/or “active ownership” conditions

====Details in the legislation to look out for====
*notional [[royalties|royalty]] 
*notional [[marketing]] royalty and marketing intangibles (including [[transfer pricing]])
*streaming
*meaning of exclusivity
*R&amp;D shortfall

====Anti-avoidance====
The following situations will be against the law:
*where a functionally irrelevant patent is incorporated into a product with the sole purpose of achieving Patent Box eligibility 
*commercially irrelevant grant of exclusivity with the sole purpose of achieving Patent Box eligibility 
*any scheme designed to inflate artificially qualifying IP income or qualifying Patent Box profits.
Reasonable and commercially appropriate steps to restructure corporate arrangements to take advantage of the Patent Box will be considered legitimate.

====Other technology tax reliefs====
*[[Research and Development Tax Credit]]
*[[Research and Development Expenditure Credit]]
*Above the Line R&amp;D Tax Relief
*[[Research and Development Capital Allowances]] 
*[[Creative Sector Tax Relief]]s including Video Games Tax Relief, Animation Tax Relief, High-end TV Production Tax Relief, and Film Tax Relief

The [[Enterprise Investment Scheme]] (EIS) and [[Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme]] (SEIS) give generous income and capital gains tax relief to individuals who invest in small early stage businesses.

====Government working group====
The government established a working group to complement wider consultation on the Patent Box and to discuss options and proposals in more detail. Members of the Working Group include representatives from: [[HMRC]] and [[HM Treasury]]; industry ([[GlaxoSmithKline]]; [[Dyson (company)|Dyson]]; [[ARM Holdings|ARM]]'''[[Syngenta]]), the financial services community including large accounting firms ([[PWC]]; [[Deloitte]]; [[KPMG]]; [[Ernst and Young]]); independent consultants and representatives from the technology commercialisation sphere and professional bodies.

====OECD Forum for Harmful Tax Practices and the EU Code of Conduct Group====
The UK government is in the process of gathering evidence to submit to the [[Forum for Harmful Tax Practices]] (FHTP), part of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), in the forum's work on international base erosion and profit shifting, specifically Action Point 5 of the OECD Action Plan published in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Publishing, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264202719-en: "OECD (2013), Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting."] Retrieved 09 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The forum provides member countries with the opportunity to review each other’s tax arrangements and to challenge harmful tax initiatives.

Action 5 focuses on “substantial activity” that must occur in a jurisdiction for a company to benefit from a specific preferential tax regime.

The UK government publicly supports the current work around Action 5 to ensure a better understanding of what constitutes economic substance when businesses carry out R&amp;D activities, so as to effectively address those instances where preferential tax regimes might present an opportunity to shift profits.&lt;ref&gt;HM Treasury March 2014, [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tackling-aggressive-tax-planning-in-the-global-economy-uk-priorities-for-the-g20-oecd-project-for-countering-base-erosion-and-profit-shifting  "Tackling aggressive tax planning in the global economy: UK priorities for the G20-OECD project for countering Base Erosion and Profit Shifting."] Retrieved 09 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Options being discussed include a new method of calculating benefits for IP-incentive tax schemes.  This is the so-called nexus approach (where underlying expenditure to create the IP is used to define the proportion of qualifying income generated from the IP), rather than the conventional transfer pricing approach (where transfer pricing principles define a substantial activity test and either the IP commercialisation activity passes the test or it does not, and all IP income thus either qualifies or it does not).

These discussions are also informed by work being carried out by the [[Economic and Financial Affairs Council]] (ECOFIN) and the EU Code of Conduct Group, which started in 2013 to look at the workings of the UK Patent Box scheme. The Code of Conduct Group operates on a similar basis to the FHTP. The Code of Conduct Group partnered with the FHTP in these discussions in early 2014.

====Anglo-German accord on the UK Patent Box====
Following a sustained period of international tax scrutiny led by Germany in the FHTP and the EU Code of Conduct Group, a compromise agreement for the UK patent box scheme based on a modified nexus approach was announced by the UK and Germany on 11 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;UK Government November 2014, [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/373135/GERMANY_UK_STATEMENT.pdf  "Proposals for New Rules for Preferential IP Regimes"] Retrieved 2 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptance of a nexus based approach will have significant implications for the UK patent box scheme; fundamentally, patent box relief will now be restricted to profits generated from IP initially developed in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmp-tax.co.uk/pdfs/A_fresh_start_for_UK_patent_box_28112014.pdf|title= A fresh start for the UK's patent box scheme.|journal=LexisNexis PSL tax|date=28 November 2014 |accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The main points in the Anglo-German accord have been announced as follows:
*a 30% uplift will be allowed to increase the value of the eligible R&amp;D expenditure proxy for outsourcing or acquisition costs 
*the existing UK regime will be closed to new entrants (for both products and patents) in June 2016 (and the existing scheme will be abolished in full by June 2021)
*IP within the existing regime will be able to retain the benefits of the scheme until June 2021, to allow time for transition to the new nexus regime 
*a practical and proportionate tracking and tracing approach will be introduced that can be implemented by companies and tax authorities with practical methodologies that companies and tax authorities can adopt to map R&amp;D expenditure to IP creation. 
The UK and Germany submitted their proposal to the OECD Forum on Harmful Tax Practices during its meeting on 17–19 November, and they have also committed to seek formal approval from the OECD and [[G20]] at the January 2015 meeting of the OECD’s Committee on Fiscal Affairs.

===Switzerland===

====Mixed-company====
Switzerland allows companies who predominantly trade internationally to benefit from the advantageous “mixed-company” status that allows them to be taxed at a rate of just 8,5%. In 2007 the European Commission alleged the tax schemes for holding, mixed and domiciliary companies violated the 1972 [[Free Trade Agreement|FTA]]    between the EU and Switzerland as it was State Aid. Although the Swiss government refuted the allegation in May 2012 the Swiss cantons gave the federal government the go-ahead to commence a tax dialogue with the EU. In May 2014 the EU and Switzerland reached an agreement whereby the disputed tax regimes would be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sif.admin.ch/sif/en/home/themen/internationale-steuerpolitik/unternehmensbesteuerung/eu-unternehmenssteuerdialog.html|title=Dialogue with the EU|author=[[State Secretariat for International Financial Matters]]|publisher=Sif.admin.ch|accessdate=19 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024161128/https://www.sif.admin.ch/sif/en/home/themen/internationale-steuerpolitik/unternehmensbesteuerung/eu-unternehmenssteuerdialog.html|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nidwalden Licence-Box regime====

The '''Pet Travel Scheme''' ("'''PETS'''") is a system which allows animals to travel easily between member countries without undergoing [[quarantine]]. A '''pet passport''' is a document that officially records information related to a specific animal, as part of that procedure. The effect is to drastically speed up and simplify travel with and transport of animals between member countries, compared to previous procedures, if the regulations are followed.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

==History==
PETS was originally introduced{{when|date=February 2018}} for the benefit of animals entering or returning to the United Kingdom from other European Union countries, since historically the UK had very strong controls to safeguard against [[rabies]] including a compulsory six-month [[quarantine]] period on imports of many animals.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

On 1 October 2001, a number of European Union countries{{clarifyme|date=February 2018}} introduced the PETS scheme, under which animals from any member country may freely travel (with the correct procedure) to any other member country on approved carriers. Over time the scheme has rolled out to other countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

== Appearance ==
The pet passport itself comes in multiple forms, sometimes a pink A4 sheet, sometimes a small blue booklet. It contains the [[microchip implant (animal)|microchip]] or [[tattoo]] number of the animal, the certification that it has had a rabies vaccination, and needs to be signed by an officially approved [[veterinary]] surgeon.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

A new style passport with laminated strips and additional security measures was introduced in the UK in December 2014. Old style passports remain valid.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

The passport is not to be confused with a much smaller folder (sometimes purple coloured), routinely issued by vets, which records the complete vaccination history of the pet.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

== Details of procedure ==
Every country has different requirements, both for export and import of animals, although some features are common to all.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

=== Common features ===
All countries:{{fact|date=February 2018}}
:* Subcutaneous (below the skin) [[Microchip implant (animal)|microchip implant]] that meets the [[International Society of Pharmacovigilance]] (SoP) specification.
:* Certified [[rabies]] [[vaccine|vaccination]], with some kind of prior period of time or evidence the vaccination is working (commonly [[blood]] [[serology]] tests to confirm the vaccination has "taken" and a delay of some months to confirm the animal is rabies-free initially). For pet travel in Europe, the rabies vaccine should be administered by a veterinarian with a minimum of 21 days before travel. Some countries may differ and always check with your local veterinarian for the procedures to follow. 
Some countries:
:* Animal treated for [[tick]]s, [[flea]]s and [[tapeworm]]s between 24 and 48 hours before boarding the outbound transport. The time limit is usually enforced ''strictly'' (i.e. no less than 24 hours and no more than 48 hours before check-in)
:* Veterinarian's letter or certificate confirming fitness to travel and/or no obvious signs of disease
:* Government certification that the veterinarian's export documentation and certificates are in order for travel
:* Sometimes only certain carriers or certain import/export points will allow animals.

In some countries the formal passport is needed. Others will accept documentation in any form so long as it provides clear evidence of the procedure being followed. Usually the animal and its papers are checked thoroughly both on boarding or export and upon arrival.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

A pet passport alone can be used to enter some countries if it records all relevant information (e.g., the UK), but it will not suffice to enter many countries. For instance [[Guatemala]], in common with almost every country operating such a scheme, demands that all [[import]]ed pets have a rabies vaccination, but will not accept the pet passport as proof of said vaccination. They require the proof of the rabies vaccination in the animal's records.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

Tapeworm treatment must be administered by a vet not less than 24 hours and not more than 120 hours (1–5 days) before scheduled arrival time.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

=== Specific country regulations ===

==== United Kingdom ====
Tapeworm treatment – (dogs only): before entering the UK, all pet dogs (including assistance dogs) must be treated for tapeworm. The treatment must be administered by a vet not less than 24 hours and not more than 120 hours (1–5 days) before its scheduled arrival time in the UK. (There is no mandatory requirement for tick treatment. No treatment is required for dogs entering the UK from Finland, Ireland or Malta).{{fact|date=February 2018}}

Prohibition on the transport of dogs and cats in the passenger cabin, or as baggage – British law precludes all animals entering the UK either in the cabin or in the hold as 'excess' or 'checked' baggage. Unlike the UK, most western countries do allow airlines to carry dogs/cats on flights provided that specific requirements are met regarding the container in which the pet will travel.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

All animals (except guide dogs) travelling to the UK must travel in the hold as manifest cargo. Most airlines do not offer cargo services to individual passengers directly and specialist agents must be used. UK law does not prohibit the transport of dogs and cats in the cabin or as hold baggage when departing from the UK, but restrictions may be imposed by individual airlines or destination countries. See [[#Other useful information|Other useful information]] below for further travel details.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

==== Japan ====
Although a participant in the PETs scheme, to bring pets into Japan from member states there are several separate procedures that must be followed. These do not cover Iceland, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Hawaii, and Guam, which have designated region ([[rabies]] free) status. If you take a pet out of Japan, it may take between 6 months to a year for it to re-enter. Including prior contact with Japanese Quarantine several months before entry:{{fact|date=February 2018}}
* The dog or cat must be microchipped.
* The dog or cat must have stayed in the country for at least 180 days (6 months) since its birth or having left Japan.
* The dog or cat must have had 2 rabies injections and a blood test 6 month before entering/re-entering Japan, proving the pet is free of rabies. This test must be carried out at a designated laboratory.
* The dog or cat does not have or show signs of rabies or Leptospirosis (dogs only).

To take a dog or cat out of Japan, on top of the necessary injections and microchip, you must:{{fact|date=February 2018}}
* Have certificates issued by an official vet to prove that your dog/cat has been vaccinated, microchipped and wormed as necessary. These are vets designated by the prefecture as able to issue certificates and officially vaccinate your dog. Contact your regional Animal Control for a full listing in your area. Your vet or local government offices can give you the information or the contact details for Animal Control.
* More than a week before travelling, notify Animal Quarantine Service at the port of departure, and apply for an export inspection for your dog/ cat. The inspection will be carried out by the Quarantine Office (Ken'eki-kyoku) before you check your pet in. The application and contact details for each office can be found online at the AQS site ( http://www.maff.go.jp/aqs/english/animal/dog ). The Quarantine Offices at international departure are often open during set times, so you may have to book the inspection for the day prior to travel if you have an early flight.

== Other useful information ==
{{howto|section=yes|date=December 2015}}
The PETS scheme is not yet standardised. This leads to much confusion. Every journey between any two countries should be researched separately to ensure that the animal will be accepted for travel upon arrival at the departure point.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

* The major delay in obtaining a pet passport is the time requirement for the rabies vaccination. The implications are:
*# An animal may get a valid rabies vaccination and serology check, and then apply for a passport on the spot, at a later date.
*# An animal whose rabies vaccination is allowed to go out of date (typically 1–2 years) by even one day, without a [[Booster dose|booster]], must start with a new vaccination and delay.
* Because PETS is European wide, the regulations may differ for travel within, and outside, Europe. Pet owners should take care since the requirements for travel to a destination may be quite different from the requirements upon returning.
* A suitable and carrier-approved [[crate (pet)|travel crate]] may be required, which must have the correct food and water containers as set out by the relevant bodies.
* Animals should '''not''' be sedated for air travel, since altitude can affect medications. Most airlines will not accept tranquilised animals nowadays. Instead, they are kept in a dark, heated, pressurized hold, which encourages them to sleep for the duration of travel.
* Larger animals may be restricted to airline routes which can accommodate their crates. Not all airlines will carry animals, and charges vary widely – check with each airline before travel.
* Some routes will not fly animals if the temperature is adverse
* Many airlines are unable to provide details of formal procedures, you may need to check with a vet or the [[consulate]] of the relevant countries to confirm details.
* Since airline staff are often (at present) poorly trained or uncertain, and conflicting information may be provided, at present it is sensible to double check and document all information supplied.
* In airlines, animals may travel as excess baggage or [[cargo]]. "Excess baggage" (in effect treating the crate and animal as another suitcase)  ensures they travel on the same flight and is often much cheaper.
* The UK restricts incoming flights to ship animals as cargo. A cheaper alternative around this aberration in the rules is to fly to some other European city, such as [[Paris]] or [[Amsterdam]], and then travel to the UK by [[Rail transport|rail]] or [[ferry]] instead, which do not have this restriction. It should be noted that passengers travelling with animals by rail or ferry to or from the UK must in many cases need to have access to a vehicle, as you cannot current take animals directly on foot by Eurostar, and neither on most ferry routes. After arriving in Europe from a non-EU  participating country, the certificate received from customs/quarantine is valid for Europe wide travel for up to 4 months, though it is best to contact [[DEFRA]] directly prior to travel.

'''''Pickup v. Brown''''' (12-17681) and '''''Welch v. Brown''''' (13-15023) are 2012 lawsuits in the United States challenging the constitutionality of California Senate bill SB 1172, which banned [[conversion therapy]] (therapy aimed at changing [[sexual orientation]]) on children under the age of 18, effective January 2013.

'''''Romanus Pontifex''''', [[Latin]] for "The Roman Pontiff",&lt;ref&gt;See full text pp.13-20 (Latin) and pp.20-26 (English) in [https://books.google.com/books?id=uLILAAAAIAAJ&amp;vid=OCLC00855948&amp;dq=nicholas+v+%22Romanus+Pontifex%22&amp;jtp=9 ''European Treaties Bearing on the History of the United States and Its Dependencies to 1648''], Washington, D.C., [[Frances Gardiner Davenport]], [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]], 1917-37 - [[Google Books]]. Reprint edition, 4 vols., (October 2004), Lawbook Exchange, {{ISBN|1-58477-422-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[papal bull]] written in 1454 by [[Pope Nicholas V]] to [[Afonso V of Portugal|King Afonso V]] of [[Portugal]]. As a follow-up to the ''[[Dum Diversas]]'', it confirmed to the Crown of Portugal dominion over all lands south of [[Cape Bojador]] in Africa. Along with encouraging the seizure of the lands of Saracen Turks and non-Christians, it repeated the earlier bull's permission for the enslavement of such peoples. The bull's primary purpose was to forbid other Christian nations from infringing the King of Portugal's rights of trade and colonisation in these regions, particularly amid the Portuguese and Castilian competition for ascendancy over new lands discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Freedom Bound: Law, Labor, and Civic Identity in Colonizing English America, 1580–1865|last=Tomlins|first=Christopher|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780521761390|location=New York|pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This bull should not be confused with a September 21, 1451 bull by the same name, also written by Nicholas V, relieving the dukes of Austria from any potential [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] censure for permitting Jews to dwell there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12273-popes-the "Popes, The", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', 1906]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
[[File:Henry_the_Navigator1.jpg|thumb|Henry the Navigator]]
Around 1312 [[Genoa|Genoese]] navigator [[Lancelotto Malocello]] came upon the [[Canary Islands]]. The Portuguese travelled there in 1341 both to trade and raid. By 1346 slave raiding was occurring. However, the first attempt at permanent colonization was sponsored by the [[Crown of Castile|Castilians]] in 1402.&lt;ref name=Thornton&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AVZDHeVEeywC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=romanus+pontifex+1436&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dSUCvnFk5S&amp;sig=GUSPMevObG1rAUMZQ4Hy35cpYCs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j_3OU6e_KYaeyASBw4DwAw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=romanus%20pontifex%201436&amp;f=false Thornton, John. ''Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World, 1400-1800'', Cambridge University Press, 1998] {{ISBN|9780521627245}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 14th century, a variety of forces competed for control of the Canaries: Genoese, Catalan-Mallorcan, Castilian, and Portuguese. In the following century, Castile and Portugal were the primary contenders.

In the early 15th century the Portuguese searched for a sea route to India to participate in the [[spice trade]]. As a first step, Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] launched expeditions to [[Exploration|explore]] the West Coast of [[Africa]]. This experience, exerted a deep impression so that his reign later on was marked by an ambitious expansion that resulted to exploratory achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Church and State Through the Centuries: A Collection of Historic Documents with Commentaries|last=Ehler|first=Sidney|last2=Morrall|first2=John|publisher=Biblo &amp; Tannen Publishers|year=1967|isbn=0819601896|location=|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, led to disputes between the Portuguese and the Castilians regarding control along the African coast. As an independent third party, the [[Pope]] would, on occasion, be asked to arbitrate disputes between kingdoms. {{sfn|Davenport p.11}} On January 5, 1443, in the papal bull ''[[Rex regum]]'', [[Eugenius IV]] took a neutral position on the disputed claims of Castile and Portugal over territory in Africa, which both claimed.{{sfn|Davenport p.12}}

==History==
[[File:Portuguese_Morocco.PNG|thumb|Portuguese possessions in Morocco (1415–1769)]] 
It was not until Alfonso V of Portugal responded to a Papal call for aid against the Turks, who eventually seized Constantinople in 1453, that Pope Nicholas V supported the Portuguese claims in the bull ''Dum Diversas''.&lt;ref name=Ehler&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2WuMyEzani8C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=romanus+pontifex&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zhvPU9OFFpa0yASPpICYBQ&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=romanus%20pontifex&amp;f=false Ehler, Sidney Z. and Morrall, John B., ''Church and State Through the Centuries: A Collection of Historic Documents with Commentaries'', Biblo &amp; Tannen, 1967] {{ISBN|9780819601896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, in 1454 a fleet of caravels from [[Seville]] and [[Cadiz]] traded along the African coast and upon their return, were intercepted by a Portuguese squadron. One of the ships was captured with crew and cargo taken to Portugal. [[Enrique IV of Castile]] threatened war. Afonso V appealed to the Pope for moral support of Portugal's right to a monopoly of trade in lands she discovered.&lt;ref name=Bown&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pDkfOAISLJIC&amp;pg=PT84&amp;lpg=PT84&amp;dq=Battle+of+Guinea+1478&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LurJNKq24D&amp;sig=wYQMCXYbhjgCtQYG8nm-s_gg2y4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=E5DSU6e1OpOryAT0h4KYCQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBDgy#v=onepage&amp;q=Battle%20of%20Guinea%201478&amp;f=false Bown, Stephen R., ''1494: How a Family Feud in Medieval Spain Divided the World in Half'', p. 73, Macmillan, 2012] {{ISBN|9780312616120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bull, issued in January 1454, endorsed Portuguese possession of [[Cueta]] (which they already held), and the exclusive right to trade, navigation, and fishing in the discovered lands. It provided an exemption from a [[Canon Law]] prohibition of trading with infidels. The bull also allowed enslavement of natives, principally for use as slaves for rowing in galleys, similar to the treatment captured Christians afforded in Islamic territories.&lt;ref name=Ehler/&gt;

==Content==

The bull praises earlier Portuguese victories against the Muslims of North Africa and the success of expeditions of discovery and conquest to the [[Azores]] and to [[Africa]] south of [[Cape Bojador]]. It also repeats earlier injunctions not to supply items useful in war such as weaponry, iron or timber to either Muslims or non-Christians. In ''Dum Diversas'', the European trade with Muslims was strictly prohibited but the ''Romanus Pontifex'' gave the King of Portugal an exception, provided that the trade did not include iron, weapons, and wood for building.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transcending Mission: The Eclipse of a Modern Tradition|last=Stroope|first=Michael|publisher=Intervarsity Press|year=2017|isbn=9780830882250|location=Downers Groove, Illinois|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, there were the threats of ecclesiastical punishments, including [[excommunication]] and [[interdiction]], for those who violate the provisions of the papal grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Americas in the Spanish World Order: The Justification for Conquest in the Seventeenth Century|last=Muldoon|first=James|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=1994|isbn=0812232453|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The substance of the Bull's articles are as follows:
 
{{quote|The Roman pontiff, successor of the key-bearer of the heavenly kingdom and vicar of Jesus Christ, contemplating with a father's mind all the several climes of the world and the characteristics of all the nations dwelling in them and seeking and desiring the salvation of all, wholesomely ordains and disposes upon careful deliberation those things which he sees will be agreeable to the Divine Majesty and by which he may bring the sheep entrusted to him by God into the single divine fold, and may acquire for them the reward of eternal felicity, and obtain pardon for their souls. This we believe will more certainly come to pass, through the aid of the Lord, if we bestow suitable favors and special graces on those Catholic kings and princes, who, like athletes and intrepid champions of the Christian faith, as we know by the evidence of facts, not only restrain the savage excesses of the Saracens and of other infidels, enemies of the Christian name, but also for the defense and increase of the faith vanquish them and their kingdoms and habitations, though situated in the remotest parts unknown to us, and ...

the said infante ... believing that he would best perform his duty to God in this matter, if by his effort and industry that sea might become navigable as far as to the Indians who are said to worship the name of Christ, and that thus he might be able to enter into relation with them, and to incite them to aid the Christians against the Saracens ...

...to conserve their right and possession, [the said king and infante] under certain most severe penalties then expressed, have prohibited and in general have ordained that none, unless with their sailors and ships and on payment of a certain tribute and with an express license previously obtained from the said king or infante, should presume to sail to the said provinces or to trade in their ports or to fish in the sea,

...since we had formerly by other letters of ours granted among other things free and ample faculty to the  aforesaid King Alfonso -- to invade, search out, capture, vanquish, and subdue all Saracens and pagans whatsoever, and other enemies of Christ wheresoever placed, and the kingdoms, dukedoms, principalities, dominions, possessions, and all movable and immovable goods whatsoever held and possessed by them and to reduce their persons to perpetual slavery, and to apply and appropriate to himself and his successors the kingdoms, dukedoms, counties, principalities, dominions, possessions, and goods, and to convert them to his and their use and profit -- by having secured the said faculty, the said King Alfonso, or, by his authority, the aforesaid infante, justly and lawfully has acquired and possessed, and doth possess, these islands, lands, harbors, and seas, and they do of right belong and pertain to the said King Alfonso and his successors, nor without special license from King Alfonso and his successors themselves has any other even of the faithful of Christ been entitled hitherto, nor is he by any means now entitled lawfully to meddle therewith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nativeweb.org/pages/legal/indig-romanus-pontifex.html Pope Nicholas V, "Romanus Pontifex", January 8, 1455, Indigenous People]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

King Afonso V gave a ceremonial lecture on the bull in [[Lisbon Cathedral]] on October 5, 1455 to inform the foreign representatives of commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/eurvoya/relex.html |title=University of Calgary: Religion &amp; Exploration |accessdate=2007-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218151827/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/eurvoya/relex.html |archivedate=December 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the bull the Portuguese had a monopoly for trade in the new areas in Africa and Asia. It also served as the legal basis for [[Boarding (attack)|boarding]] foreign ships in that area. Historian Stephen Bown notes that, "... Prince Henry and King Afonso V had now also shrouded Portuguese commercial activities in a cloak of pious devotion to the church's work".{{sfn|Bown p.74}} Along with the right of conquest, the ''Romanus Pontifex'' effectively made the Portuguese king and his representatives as the church's direct agents of ecclesiastical administration and expansion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Portuguese authorities sent to colonise lands were not only commanded to build churches, monasteries, and holy places, but also authorized to perform religious functions such as hearing confessions, granting of [[absolution]], and the administration of [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Colonialism===
{{cleanup|date=January 2011}}
In 1493 [[Pope Alexander VI]] issued the Bull ''[[Inter caetera]]'' stating one Christian nation did not have the right to establish dominion over lands previously dominated by another Christian nation. Together, the ''Dum Diversas'', the ''Romanus Pontifex'' and the ''Inter Caetera'' have been interpreted as serving as a justification for the [[Age of Imperialism]]. They were also early influences on the development of the [[slave trade]] of the 15th and 16th centuries, even though the papal bull [[Sublimus Dei]] of 1537 forbade the enslavement of non-Christians. The executive brief for Sublimus Dei was withdrawn by the Pope after protests by the Spanish monarchy. Paul III publicly sanctioned slavery in Rome in 1545, the enslavement of [[Henry VIII]] in 1547 and the purchase of Muslim slaves in 1548.&lt;ref&gt;"The Catholic Church and Slavery", J. F Maxwell, 1975, Barry-Rose Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman Housley observes that "it would be unfair to criticize the papal court exclusively for its failure to be more discriminating in its grants or to take more frequently the kind of action which Eugenius IV adopted in 1454 over the Canaries".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5qCDL94HWN8C&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=Creator+Omnium+1434&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nTXOUBRfNs&amp;sig=7seQN4gX93Y3kJfIJNumZBbo2-E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qzPRU8TGHJDaoATyh4HIAg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Joan%20of%20Portugal&amp;f=false Housley, Norman. ''Religious Warfare in Europe 1400-1536'', p. 187, Oxford University Press, 2002] {{ISBN|9780198208112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of discovery, and the conversion and enslavement that accompanied it, were identified with hard-held concepts of crusade and chivalry at that time.

===United States===
{{See also|Discovery doctrine}}
In the 1823 case ''[[Johnson v. M'Intosh]]'' Chief Justice John Marshall found a "universal recognition" of a so-called [[Discovery doctrine]] that held that discovery gave title to the government by whose subjects, or by whose authority, it was made, against all other European governments, which title might be consummated by possession.&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;[http://www.historytools.org/sources/Johnson-v-MIntosh.pdf Marshall, John. ''Johnson v. M'Intosh'', 21 U.S. 543, 5 L.Ed. 681, 8 Wheat. 543 (1823)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924030506/http://www.historytools.org/sources/Johnson-v-MIntosh.pdf |date=2015-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Spain did not rest her title solely on the grant of the Pope. Her discussions respecting boundary, with France, with Great Britain, and with the United States, all show that she placed it on the rights given by discovery. Portugal sustained her claim to the Brazils by the same title.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most of the opinion is [[dicta]]; thus, all that the opinion holds with respect to aboriginal title is that it is inalienable, a principle that remains well-established law in nearly all common law jurisdictions.

This decision was upheld in the 1831 case ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'', giving Georgia authority to extend state laws over [[Cherokee]]s within the state, and famously describing Native American tribes as "domestic dependent nations." This decision was modified in ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'', which stated that the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], and not individual [[U.S. state|states]], had authority in Indian affairs, but it maintained the loss of right to title upon discovery by Europeans.

In recent years, Native American groups including the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] and [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]] have called on the [[Holy See|Vatican]] to revoke the bulls of 1452, 1455, and 1493. The [[Haudenosaunee]] countered the papal bulls with the [[Two Row Wampum]] conditionally accepting the bulls stating through the two row wampum "You say that you are our Father and I am your Son We will not be like Father and Son, but like Brothers. This wampum belt confirms our words. '. Neither of us will make compulsory laws or interfere in the internal affairs of the other. Neither of us will try to steer the other's vessel."

===Mission===
After [[Vasco da Gama]] found the sea route to India in 1498, the Portuguese practiced trading for four centuries. Portuguese clerics were only responsible for the needs of the Portuguese, and clerics of other nations were not allowed to operate in [[Portuguese India]].

In [[Goa]], envoys of the Pope were arrested and sent back to Portugal.

'''[http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/1317393/ Section 5 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1963 (Act 36 of 1963)]'''is an enabling provision to assist the litigants who failed to do an act within the prescribed time period as originally fixed under various enactments. Whether Section 5 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1963 will applicable to the Execution Proceedings instituted under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act 5 of 1908)?.

==Introduction==
'''[http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/1317393/ Section 5 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1963 (Act 36 of 1963)]'''is an enabling provision to assist the litigants who failed to do an act within the prescribed time period as originally fixed under the various enactments. For example, a litigant who failed to file an Appeal before the superior courts within the permissible time period as originally fixed then he can file it after the expiry of the prescribed time period provided he has to show “sufficient cause” for non-filing the Appeal within the time period. Likewise while running a case either before the subordinates’ courts or any superior courts; the litigants have to file necessary applications under various enactments for smooth running of the case, but such an applications has not been filed in-time then he can file it latter on provided he has to shown “sufficient cause” for late filing of the same.

==Non-application of Section 5 to certain cases==
* The Section 5 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1963 is applicable only to the situation where the suit or appeal is already filed and pending for disposal. Suppose if the Suit or Appeal is not filed within the stipulated time-period, then this provision is not applicable to get an extension of time period for filing the same.
* Likewise this provision is applicable only to the proceedings which are exclusively pending before the '''''Courts''''' and it is not applicable to the proceedings pending before any Tribunals because mostly the Tribunals shall be constituted only by an act of Special Laws which prescribes all mode of remedies and it never borrows any provisions from outside sources and to put it in other words such Special Laws can be called as '''''“Self-contained Enactments”'''''. For example, ''Rent Control Acts, Banking Tribunals, Income Tax Tribunals, Land Acquisition Act, etc.,''
* Likewise for the enforcement of the Decrees, Orders passed by the court of law the litigants has to file an Execution Petition before the Executing Court by exercising the provisions as enshrined under the '''''Chapter Execution in Part II (Sections 36 to 74)''''' with the aid of '''''Order XXI of the First Schedule of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908)'''''. For filing such an Execution Petition Section 5 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1963 is strictly not applicable because the Execution Petition should be filed within the time-period as originally fixed under the Enactments failing which the litigants/Decree-Holder in the eyes of law had exhausted his lawful remedies as such he cannot thereafter enforcing his rights as enshrined under the Decrees, Orders, etc., passed by the Courts in his favour.

== Gist of Section 5 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1963==
Section 5 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1963 which runs as follows:

''5. Extension of prescribed period in certain cases: Any appeal or any application, '''''other than an application under any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908)''''', may be admitted after the prescribed period, if the appellant or the applicant satisfies the court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such period.''

''Explanation:'' The fact that the appellant or the applicant was misled by any order, practice or judgment of the High Court in ascertaining or computing the prescribed period may be sufficient cause within the meaning of this section.

==Gist of Rule 105 of Order XXI of Code of Civil Procedure, 1997==
''Rule 105: Hearing of application: (1) The Court, before which an application under any of the foregoing rules of this Order is pending, may fix a day for the hearing of the application.
&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Where on the day fixed or on any other day to which the hearing may be adjourned the applicant does not appear when the case is called on for hearing, the Court may make an order that the application be dismissed.
&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Where the applicant appears and the opposite party to whom the notice has been issued by the Court does not appear, the Court may hear the application exparte and pass such order as it thinks fit.''

''Explanation:'' An application referred to in sub-rule (1) includes a claim or objection made under rule 58.

Thereafter a proviso was added to sub-rule (3) by way of an Amendment made by the '''[[Madras High Court]]''' which was published by the '''[[Tamil Nadu]]''' '''Government Gazette''' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tn.gov.in/stationeryprinting/gazette/gazette_list.php&lt;/ref&gt; dated 27-02-1972, Part V, Page 1523 which is applicable to both '''[[Tamil Nadu]]''' and '''[[Puducherry]]''' Courts and the proviso which runs as follows: ''“Provided that an application may be admitted after the said period of thirty days if the applicant satisfies the Court that he had sufficient cause for not making the application within such period”''

==Amendments made to Code of Civil Procedure==
A major amendment was made to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) by way of Amendment Act 104 of 1976, Amendment Act 46 of 1999 and Amendment Act 22 of 2002 and all those Amendment Acts in its ''“Repeal and Savings Clauses”'' clearly specifics that any amendment made or any provision inserted in the principal Act by a State Legislature or High Court shall also stand repealed, except insofar as it is consistent with the provisions of the principal Act.

So again a doubt arises that what is meant by ''“Principal Act”'' with reference to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) for which lot of judicial pronouncements are there which unanimously held that ''“Principal Act”'' which refers only to the ''"body of the Code"'' or the ''"Sections Part of the Code"'' and not to the First Schedule of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.

As such in view of Section 122 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 the High Courts have the powers to annul, alter or add to all or any of the rules in the First Schedule of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and it implies that the High Courts have not powers to amend the ''"body of the Code"'' or the "Sections Part of the Code"....

==Collaborative discussions==
In view of the Amendments made to the First Schedule of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) which discusses the Orders and Rules for implementing the Act among which a Proviso to sub-rule (3) of Rule 105 of Order XXI which paves ways to the defaulting litigants who satisfies the Court that he had '''''“sufficient cause”''''' for not making the application within the prescribed period.

So Section 5 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1963 which strictly prohibits from entertaining any application under this Section before the Executing Court which implies in its words that, '''''“Any appeal or any application, other than an application under any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908)"''''' as such the Madras High Court has made an Amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 thereby a new Proviso was added to sub-rule (3) to Rule 105 of Order XXI (vide Tamil Nadu Government Gazette dated 27-02-1972, Part V, Page 1523) which paves ways to the defaulting litigants who satisfies the Court that he had '''''“sufficient cause”''''' for not making the application within the prescribed period as held by the Hon’ble '''[[Madras High Court]]''' in its landmark decision dated 12-08-2011 in '''''N.Rajendran Vs. Shriram Chits Tamil Nadu Private Limited, rep. by its Branch Manager''''' which is reported in '''''[2011 (5) Madras Law Weekly 174]'''''.&lt;ref&gt;http://judis.nic.in/judis_chennai/qrydisp.aspx?filename=33666&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hcmadras.tn.nic.in/jacademy/e%20journal/2011/eNovember%202011.pdf{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==
As mandated under Section 5 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1963 (Act 36 of 1963) no application would be maintainable before the Executing Court under this provision as such it is clearly concluded that Section 5 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1963 is strictly non-applicable to Execution Proceedings and the aggrieving party who lost his rights by way of his default may seek remedy under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) itself since it seems to be a '''''“Self-contained Enactment”''''' for every exigencies arisen thereof.

In [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]], a '''solemn vow''' is a vow ("a deliberate and free promise made to God about a possible and better good")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4E.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1191 §1]&lt;/ref&gt; that the Church has recognized as such.&lt;ref name="Code of Canon Law, canon 1192 §2"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4E.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1192 §2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Any other vow, public or private, individual or collective, concerned with an action or with abstaining from an action, is a '''simple vow'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4E.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1992 §2]&lt;/ref&gt; Even a vow accepted by a legitimate superior in the name of the Church (the definition of a "public vow")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4E.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1992 §1]&lt;/ref&gt; is a simple vow if the Church has not granted it recognition as a solemn vow. In canon law a vow is public (concerning the Church itself directly) only if a legitimate superior accepts it in the name of the Church; all other vows, no matter how much publicity is given to them, are classified as private vows&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4E.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1192 §1]&lt;/ref&gt; (concerning directly only those who make them). The vow taken at [[profession (religious)|profession]] as a member of any [[Religious institute#Categorization|religious institute]] is a public vow,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P26.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 654]&lt;/ref&gt; but in recent centuries can be either solemn or simple.

There is disagreement among theologians as to whether the distinction between solemn and simple vows derives simply from a decision of the Church to treat them differently or whether, in line with the opinion of Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;ref name=Aquinas&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3088.htm#article7 ''Summa Theologica'' II-II, q. 88, art. 7]&lt;/ref&gt; a solemn vow is, antecedently to any decision by the Church, a more strict, perfect and complete consecration to God.&lt;ref name=Sugawara&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NPCwDiIE9sAC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=%22code+of+canon+law%22+%22simple+vow%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=M_kjTu2BKYe7hAf_qPDEAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22code%20of%20canon%20law%22%20%22simple%20vow%22&amp;f=false Yūji Sugawara, ''Religious Poverty: from Vatican Council II to the 1994 Synod of Bishops'' (Loyola Press 1997, pp. 127-128)],  {{ISBN|978-88-7652-698-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas held that the only vows that could be considered solemn were those made by receiving the [[Holy Orders (Catholic Church)|holy orders]] as a member of the [[Hierarchy of the Catholic Church|Catholic Hierarchy]], or by the religious profession of the rule as a member of a [[Catholic religious order]]. As a unique{{cn|date=July 2018}} exception to this traditional dichotomy, the Benedictine [[abbot|abbots]] could be consecrated bishops by an analogue [[Sacred tradition|apostolic authority]] (like another bishop, an archbishop, or the pope)&lt;ref name=="osb.org"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.osb.org/intl/confed/bishops.html|title= Benedictine Monks Consecrated Bishops and Monks Appointed Abbots Ordinary|website= osb.org|access-date= Jul 22, 2018|language= en|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120207202936/http://www.osb.org/intl/confed/bishops.html|archive-date= Feb 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This practice was contemplated by the canonical law since the [[Timeline of the Middle Ages|Middle Age]], as it is testified by the later life of [[Peter Cellensis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/div-classtitlefriendship-and-rivalry-the-role-of-amicitia-in-twelfth-century-monastic-relationsdiv/9C61A8450F37D09937DF2A994BC6938B|author1= J.

Since the XVIII century, consecrators and [[apostolic succession|episcopal lineage]] were extended to the Benedectine monks-bishops&lt;ref name=="osb.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/ordinations-of-us-catholic-bishops-1790-1989-a-chronological-list/oclc/22690473|title= Ordinations of U.S. Catholic Bishops, 1790-1989|language= en|journal= (Proceedings of the) National Conference of Catholic Bishops, U.S. Catholic Conference (N. 323-X)|place= Washington, D.C.|date= 1990|pages= 277|archive-url= |archive-date= |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

As support for his view, he cited the fact that these two vows alone were considered to make the celebration of marriage invalid.&lt;ref name=Aquinas/&gt; A man who promised, either to a human being or to God (thus making a vow), to marry a certain woman was bound by that promise or vow, but if he broke it and married a different woman, the marriage was nonetheless considered valid. Similarly, if he made a vow to enter a particular religious institute or become a priest, but instead entered a different institute or decided to marry, the religious profession or the marriage, despite being a violation of his vow, was still considered valid. But once he had received holy orders or made religious profession, any marriage he contracted was considered null and void.

Solemn vows were originally considered indissoluble. Not even the Pope could dispense from them.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologica'', II-II, q. 88, a.11&lt;/ref&gt; If for a just cause a religious was expelled, the vow of chastity remained unchanged and so rendered invalid any attempt at marriage, the vow of obedience obliged in relation, generally, to the bishop rather than to the religious superior, and the vow of poverty was modified to meet the new situation but the expelled religious "could not, for example, will any goods to another; and goods which came to him reverted at his death to his institute or to the Holy See".&lt;ref name=Quay&gt;[http://www.canonlaw.info/a_quaydoc.htm Paul M. Quay, "Renewal of Religious Orders, or Destruction?", in ''Commentarium pro Religiosis et Missionariis'', vol. 65 (1984), pp. 77-86]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solemn and simple vows in religious institutes==

Originally, the vows taken by profession in any of the religious institutes approved by the Holy See were classified not only as public but also as solemn.&lt;ref name=Vermeersch&gt;[http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Religious_Life Arthur Vermeersch,  "Religious Life" in The Catholic Encyclopedia., Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115054809/http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Religious_Life |date=15 January 2012 }}. Accessed 18 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This was declared by [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (1235 – 1303).&lt;ref&gt;"Illud solum votum debere dici solemne . . . quod solemnizatum fuerit per suceptionem S. Ordinis aut per professionem expressam vel tacitam factam alicui de religionibus per Sedem Apostolicam approbatis" (C. unic. de voto, tit. 15, lib. III in 6, quoted in [https://archive.org/stream/religiouscongreg00frer#page/16/mode/2up/search/%22Illud+solum+votum+debere+dici+solemne%22 Celestine Anthony Freriks, ''Religious Congregations in Their External Relations''], p. 17).&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation changed in the 16th century.  In 1521, two years after the [[Fifth Lateran Council]] had forbidden the establishment of new religious institutes, [[Pope Leo X]] appointed a rule with simple vows for those [[third order|tertiaries]] attached to existing institutes who undertook to live in a community. In 1566 and 1568, [[Pope Pius V]] rejected this class of institute, but they continued to exist and even increased in number. After at first being merely tolerated, they afterwards obtained approval.&lt;ref name=Vermeersch/&gt; Only on almost the last day of the 19th century were they officially reckoned as religious, when [[Pope Leo XIII]] recognized as religious all men and women who took simple vows in such congregations.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution "Conditae a Christo" of 8 December 1900, cited in [http://www.dom.edu/export/sites/dominican/mcgreal/volumeone/DaHCHAP11.pdf Mary Nona McGreal, ''Dominicans at Home in a New Nation'', chapter 11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927150743/http://www.dom.edu/export/sites/dominican/mcgreal/volumeone/DaHCHAP11.pdf |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special case applied to the Jesuits. In the 16th century, [[Ignatius of Loyola]] obtained authorization for the members of the [[Society of Jesus]] to be divided into the professed with solemn vows and the coadjutors with dispensable simple vows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WtnR-6_PlJAC&amp;pg=PA1421&amp;dq=jesuits+%22solemn+vows%22+%22simple+vows%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dVclTo2RDNGwhAeI-43lCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=jesuits%20%22solemn%20vows%22%20%22simple%20vows%22&amp;f=false Karl Rahner, ''Sacramentum Mundi'', article "Religious Orders"]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, before Pope Leo XIII's reforms in the 19th century, these simple vows constituted them religious in the true and proper sense of the word, with the consequent privileges and exemption of regulars, including the vows being a diriment impediment to matrimony, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Quanto fructuosius (1-2-1583) and Ascendente Domino (5-24-1584).&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, the recognition as religious for simple vows had universal validity, but in practice, the Roman Curia considered it an exclusive privilege to the Society of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Religious Life'', Vol. 3, Jesús Álvarez Gómez, CMF, 1990 (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Codes of Canon Law on religious institutes==

On the basis of the distinction between solemn and simple vows, the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]] made several other distinctions in relation to religious institutes, which it defined as legitimately established associations in accordance with which the members make public vows, either perpetual vows or temporary ones that are to be renewed periodically.  It reserved the name "religious ''order''" for institutes in which the vows were solemn, and used the term "religious ''congregation''" for those with simple vows. The members of a religious ''order'' for men were called "regulars", those belonging to a religious ''congregation'' were simply "religious", a term that applied also to regulars. For women, those with simple vows were simply "sisters", with the term "[[nun]]" reserved in canon law for those who belonged to an institute of solemn vows, even if in some localities they were allowed to take simple vows instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_P1D.HTM 1917 Code of Canon Law, canon 488]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the 1917 Code abolished the distinction according to which solemn vows, unlike simple vows, were indissoluble. It recognized no totally indispensable religious vows and thereby abrogated for the [[Latin Church]] the special consecration that distinguished "orders" from "congregations", while keeping some juridical distinctions.&lt;ref name=Quay/&gt;

A juridical distinction that the 1917 Code maintained was its declaring invalid any marriage attempted by solemnly professed religious or by those with simple vows to which the Holy See had attached the effect of invalidating marriage,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_P3F.HTM 1917 Code of Canon Law, canon 1073]&lt;/ref&gt; while stating that no simple vow rendered a marriage invalid, except in the cases in which the [[Holy See]] directed otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_P3E.HTM 1917 Code of Canon Law, canon 1058]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus solemnly professed religious were barred absolutely from marriage, and any marriage they attempted was invalid. Those who made simple vows were obliged not to marry, but if they did break their vow, the marriage was considered [[valid but illicit]].

Another difference was that a professed religious of solemn vows lost the right to own property and the capacity to acquire temporal goods for himself or herself, but a professed religious of simple vows, while being prohibited by the vow of poverty from using and administering property, kept ownership and the right to acquire more, unless the constitutions of the religious institute explicitly stated the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_P1M.HTM 1917 Code of Canon Law, canons 580-582]&lt;/ref&gt;

These were two of the nine juridical consequences (apart from spiritual effects) of the difference between solemn and simple vows.&lt;ref name=Sugawara/&gt;

After publication of the 1917 Code, many institutes with simple vows appealed to the Holy See for permission to make solemn vows. The Apostolic Constitution ''Sponsa Christi'' of 21 November 1950 made access to that permission easier for nuns (in the strict sense), though not for religious institutes dedicated to apostolic activity. Many of these institutes of women then petitioned for the solemn vow of poverty alone. Towards the end of the [[Second Vatican Council]], superiors general of clerical institutes and abbots president of monastic congregations were authorized to permit, for a just cause, their subjects of simple vows who made a reasonable request to renounce their property except for what would be required for their sustenance if they were to depart.&lt;ref name=Sugawara/&gt;

The [[1983 Code of Canon Law]] maintains the distinction between solemn and simple vows,&lt;ref name="Code of Canon Law, canon 1192 §2"/&gt; but no longer makes any distinction between their juridical effects. For instance, while under the 1917 Code solemn vows rendered a subsequent marriage invalid, but simple vows only made the marriage illicit, the current Code of Canon Law states that "those bound by a public perpetual vow of chastity in a religious institute invalidly attempt marriage".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3Y.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1088]&lt;/ref&gt;

Renunciation of the right to own property is now a matter for the constitutions of the religious institute in question and is associated not with the solemnity of the vows but with their perpetuity. The 1983 Code states:
{{quote|A person who must renounce fully his or her goods due to the nature of the institute is to make that renunciation before perpetual profession in a form valid, as far as possible, even in civil law; it is to take effect from the day of profession. A perpetually professed religious who wishes to renounce his or her goods either partially or totally according to the norm of proper law and with the permission of the supreme moderator is to do the same.

A professed religious who has renounced his or her goods fully due to the nature of the institute loses the capacity of acquiring and possessing and therefore invalidly places acts contrary to the vow of poverty. Moreover, whatever accrues to the professed after renunciation belongs to the institute according to the norm of proper law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P28.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 668 §§4-5]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[United States]] [[Internal Revenue Code]] contains a limited number of specific statutory provisions excluding from income economic benefits that would otherwise constitute gross income under the Code.  IRC § 108 constitutes one such exclusion.  Section 108 excludes discharge of indebtedness&lt;ref&gt;Discharge of indebtedness refers to the value realized by a taxpayer who discharges a debt for an amount less than originally agreed upon.&lt;/ref&gt; from gross income under certain specified conditions, such as when the discharge occurs in [[bankruptcy]] or when the taxpayer is insolvent.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' §§ 108(a)(1)(A), (B)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/108 26 USC § 108 - Income from discharge of indebtedness], [[Cornell University]], Retrieved November 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;   Under ordinary taxation principles, discharge of debt would clearly fall within the broad definition of gross income provided by the Code.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Id.'' § 61(a)&lt;/ref&gt;  Section 108 thus provides a measure of relief for certain taxpayers who find themselves facing serious financial difficulties.

Unfortunately for financially troubled taxpayers, exclusion under § 108 comes at a cost.  Under § 108(b)(1), "the amount excluded from gross income under … subsection (a)(1) shall be applied to reduce the tax attributes of the taxpayer".  Thus, excluding income under § 108 requires a taxpayer to postpone his or her tax liability by decreasing dollar-for-dollar&lt;ref&gt;Except in the case of general business credits, minimum tax credits, and foreign tax carryovers, which must be reduced by one-third dollar-for-dollar.&lt;/ref&gt; certain "tax attributes" that would otherwise be available to offset future income.   ''Id.'' § (b)(3)(A).

Section 108(b)(2) provides the general rule that taxpayers must reduce seven specified tax attributes in the following order.  These attributes are:

* Net operating losses.
* General business credits.
* Minimum tax credits.
* Capital loss carryovers.
* Basis of property.
* Passive activity loss and credit carryovers.
* Foreign tax credit carryovers.

Should a taxpayer decide that he or she would be better situated preserving loss carryovers until the next taxable year, however, he or she may elect to apply any or all of the excluded income to reduce basis in property before reducing another attribute.&lt;ref&gt;IRC § 108(b)(5); Treas. Reg. § 1.108-7(a)(2)&lt;/ref&gt;  To the extent that a taxpayer applies excluded income for purposes other than basis reduction under the election, the taxpayer must follow the prescribed order.&lt;ref&gt;Treas. Reg. § 1.108-7(a)(2)&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless of whether a taxpayer makes an election, any reductions in basis are governed by § 1017.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Dalmarnock fire tests''' are a series of fire experiments that were conducted in a real high-rise building in the United Kingdom.

In 2006, the [[BRE Centre for Fire Safety Engineering]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]], conducted this series of large-scale fire tests in a high-rise building in collaboration with the BBC series ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'', [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council|EPSRC]], [[Glasgow Housing Association]], [[Strathclyde Fire and Rescue Service|Strathclyde Fire Brigade]], [[Glasgow Caledonian University]], Lion TV, [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]], [[Building Research Establishment|BRE]], [[Xtralis]] and Powerwall Systems Ltd, among other contributors.

==Description==
The building, a 23-storey reinforced-concrete tower located at 4 Millerfield Place in [[Dalmarnock]], Glasgow, was scheduled for demolition and hence was evacuated of tenants. Three main experiments were conducted over two days, from 25 to 26 July 2006. Tests One and Two took place in identical flats, the main compartment of which had been fitted with regular living room and office furniture, arranged to provide conditions that favour repeatability. Test Three was a smaller smoke management experiment held in one of the two main emergency exit stairwells.

Tests One and Two were fully instrumented with a high sensor density, including measurements of temperature, incident heat, gas velocities, smoke obscuration, wall temperature and structure deflection, among others. The tests varied in that Test One allowed the fire to develop freely to post-[[flashover]] conditions, while Test Two incorporated sensor-informed ventilation management and was extinguished before post-flashover conditions were attained. Both tests had approximately 300 sensors monitoring several different characteristics of the fire environment, but Test One had about 160 additional sensors monitoring the structural response.

These experiments endeavoured to establish a highly monitored fire in a realistic residential scenario, allowing for several different modern fire safety engineering tools to be tested. The comprehensive set of data collected is being used for validation of different [[mathematical model]]s of fire dynamics. Because the data has a spatial resolution high enough to be comparable to typical resolutions of [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] fire models, the tests are specially well suited for validation of this type of models. The tests also form an integral part of the research conducted for the FireGrid research project,&lt;ref name="FireGrid"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/1156 |title=FireGrid Project |accessdate=2018-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, the development of emergency control systems that use continuous sensor data and computer modelling, to provide forecast of the fire evolution and aid the efficient deployment of resources.

==Analysis and dissemination==
Analysis of the copious amounts of test data collected will take several years to complete. Nevertheless, there has been significant dissemination activities of the findings to date in the form of several related journal and conference papers; a one-day seminar introducing the tests and highlighting the analysis and conclusions to date (held in Edinburgh, November 2007);&lt;ref name="Dalmarnock FireSeat"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fireseat.eng.ed.ac.uk/dalmarnock-fire-tests-experiments-and-modelling |title=FireSeat The Dalmarnock Fire Tests: Experiments and Modelling |accessdate=2018-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a book detailing the tests and analysis completed to date was published in November 2007. The book, entitled ''The Dalmarnock Fire Tests: Experiments and Modelling'',&lt;ref name="Dalmarnock Book @ WorldCat"&gt;{{cite web |title=WorldCat: The Dalmarnock Fire Tests: Experiments and Modelling |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/419909727 |accessdate=2018-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; comprises material covering characterisation and comparison of both the Test One and Test Two fires; experimental error analysis; evaluation of the fire detection systems; calculation of heat transfer to the structure; analysis of the structural behaviour; evaluation of ceiling fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) performance; and comparison of both [[a priori and a posteriori]] computational fire, modelling against experimental data allowing for an evaluation of such the current use of tools.

The overall aim of the Dalmarnock fire tests is to improve understanding of how building fire emergencies can be handled in the most effective manner, while providing further insights into the fundamentals of compartment fire dynamics and fire-induced structural behaviour.

{{Tort law|property}}

''Trespass to land'' is a [[common law]] [[tort]] or [[crime]] that is committed when an individual or the object of an individual intentionally (or, in [[Australia]], [[negligence|negligently]]) enters the land of another without a lawful [[excuse]]. Trespass to land is ''actionable per se''. Thus, the party whose land is entered upon may sue even if no actual harm is done.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}  In some jurisdictions, this rule may also apply to entry upon public land having restricted access.  A court may order payment of [[damages]] or an [[injunction]] to remedy the tort.

By law, trespass for mesne profits is a suit against someone who has been ejected from property that did not belong to them. The suit is for recovery of damages the trespasser caused to the property and for any profits he or she may have made while in possession of that property.

For a trespass to be actionable, the [[tortfeasor]] must voluntarily go to a specific location, but need not be aware that he entered the property of a particular person. If A forces B unwillingly onto C's land, C will not have action in trespass against B, because B's actions were involuntary. C may instead claim against A.  Furthermore, if B is deceived by A as to the ownership or boundaries of C's land, A may be jointly liable with B for B's trespass.

In most jurisdictions, if a person were to accidentally enter onto private property, there would be no trespass, because the person did not intend any violation. However, in Australia, [[negligence]] may substitute the requirement for intent.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

If a trespass is actionable and no action is taken within reasonable or prescribed time limits, the land owner may forever lose the right to seek a remedy, and may even forfeit certain property rights. ''See [[Adverse possession]]'' and [[Easement]] by prescription.

Trespass may also arise upon the [[easement]] of one person upon the land of another. For example, if A grants B a right to pass freely across A's land, then A would trespass upon B's easement by erecting a locked gate or otherwise blocking B's rightful access.

In some jurisdictions trespass while in possession of a firearm, which may include a low-power air weapon without ammunition, constitutes a more grave crime of armed trespass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marplerifleandpistolclub.org.uk/general/gunlaw.htm#Shotgun_Certificates_%28SGC%29 Marple Rifle &amp; Pistol Club, Gun Law in the UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

The maxim "cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad infernos" (whoever owns the land owns it all the way to the heavens and to hell) is said to apply, however that has been limited by practical considerations. For example, aerial trespass is limited to airspace which might be used (therefore aeroplanes cannot be sued). Landowners may not put up structures to prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;TWA v Hickel (California 1940)&lt;/ref&gt; The courts have been more lenient with underground trespass. The Kentucky Court of Appeal in [[Edwards v Sims]] (1929) 24 SW 2d 619 seems to affirm the maxim without qualification, whereas the New South Wales Supreme Court in Australia seemed more reluctant to do so in Di Napoli v New Beach Apartments (2004) Aust Torts Reports 81-728. There is therefore an asymmetry between aerial and underground trespass, which may be resolved by the fact the ground is almost always used (to support buildings and other structures) whereas airspace loses its practical use above the height of skyscrapers.

There may be [[regulation]]s that hold a trespasser to a higher [[duty of care]], such as [[strict liability]] for [[timber trespass]] (removing trees beyond a permitted boundary), which is a type of [[trespass to chattels]] as a result of a trespass to land.

Some cases also provide remedies for trespass not amounting to personal presence, as where an object is intentionally deposited, or farm animals are permitted to wander upon the land of another.  Furthermore, if a new use of nearby land interferes with a land owner's [[quiet enjoyment]] of his rights, there may be an action for [[nuisance]], as where a disagreeable aroma or noise from A drifts across the land of B.

Trespass ab initio is when a person is granted access to land but then abuses that access. The entry to the land is considered to have been a trespass from the beginning. This only applies to access given by law, not to access given by a person (as established by the [[Six Carpenters' Case]]).

==United Kingdom==
===England===
{{main|Trespass in English law}}
In English law, trespass to land involves the "unjustifiable interference with land which is in the immediate and exclusive possession of another". Land is defined as the surface, subsoil, airspace and anything permanently attached to the land, such as houses. It is not necessary to prove that harm was suffered to bring a claim, and is instead actionable ''per se''. While most trespasses to land are intentional, it can also be committed negligently. Accidental trespass also incurs liability, with an exception for entering land adjoining a road unintentionally (such as in a car accident). Although previously a pure tort, the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] created some circumstances in which trespass to land can also be a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Catherine|last1=Elliott|first2=Francis|last2=Quinn|title=Tort Law|publisher=[[Longman]]|year=2007|edition=6th|isbn=978-1-4058-4672-1|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
Trespass is an offence under Scots Law; however, the legislation was amended under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 which established universal access rights to most land and inland water. These reforms do not apply (hence trespass remains an offence) to:
:*Houses and gardens, and non-residential buildings and associated land;
:*Land in which crops are growing;
:*Land next to a school and used by the school;
:*Sports or playing fields when these are in use and where the exercise of access rights would interfere with such use;
:*Land developed and in use for recreation and where the exercise of access rights would interfere with such use;
:*Golf courses (but you can cross a golf course provided you don’t interfere with any games of golf);
:*Places like airfields, railways, telecommunication sites, military bases and installations, working quarries and construction sites; and
:*Visitor attractions or other places which charge for entry.

==United States==
In most states, a criminal trespass to land is defined by statute and constitutes a [[misdemeanor]].&lt;ref name=ic&gt;E.g. "criminal trespass" in [[Indiana Code]] [http://www.ai.org/legislative/ic/code/title35/ar43/ch2.html 35-43-2-2].&lt;/ref&gt; In some states, it may be a [[felony]] under certain circumstances (e.g., trespassing on a research facility or school property).&lt;ref name=ic/&gt;  Remedies between private parties for trespass may include an [[injunction]] or money damages.
