'''The AbleGamers Foundation''' (also known as '''The AbleGamers Charity''') is an American [[nonprofit organization]] and [[Foundation (non-profit)|foundation]] dedicated to improving accessibility in the video game space, enabling more people with disabilities to be able to play video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schuster |first=Shawn |url=http://massively.joystiq.com/2009/04/09/do-developers-consider-disabled-gamers-enough/|publisher=Massively by Joystiq|title=Do Developers Consider Disabled Gamers Enough |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams |first=Paul |url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2011/07/accessible-games/#more-36954|publisher=Wired Magazine|title=Gamers With Disabilities Battle Indifferent Industry |date=2011-07-14 |accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charity creates resources, assists individuals in getting the peripherals they need, runs scholarships,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/12/01/ablegamers-will-send-3-developers-with-disabilities-to-train-jam-and-gdc-2018/|title=AbleGamers will send 3 developers with disabilities to Train Jam and GDC 2018|last=Minotti|first=Mike|date=1 December 2017|work=VentureBeat|access-date=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and works with video game publishers and video game companies to improve accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.windowscentral.com/ablegamers-xbox-adaptive-controller-interview|title=How AbleGamers aims to bring gaming to those with disabilities|last=Corden|first=Jez|date=5 June 2018|work=Windows Central|access-date=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
AbleGamers was founded by Mark Barlet and Stephanie Walker in 2004 after Walker discovered that her [[Multiple sclerosis]] was stopping her being able to properly control a [[computer mouse]] to play video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/episode-406-1.4804831/xbox-s-adaptive-controller-aims-to-bring-gaming-to-community-of-disabled-players-1.4804836|title=Xbox's Adaptive Controller aims to bring gaming to community of disabled players|last=|first=|date=8 September 2018|work=CBC|access-date=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charity works with individuals to assess their needs and challenges, determining what equipment they need to help them play video games - including both existing and new, custom-made, hardware. This includes both online consultations and visits to the charity's facilities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.shacknews.com/article/99906/how-ablegamers-turned-an-old-coast-guard-facility-to-a-hub-for-disabled-gamers|title=How AbleGamers Turned an Old Coast Guard Facility to a Hub for Disabled Gamers|last=Mejia|first=Ozzie|date=9 May 2017|work=Shacknews|access-date=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charity helps up to 300 people every year through direct support, and more through online resources.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/street-fighter-brolylegs-disabled-gamers-hardware-ablegamers-xbox-special-effects-software-players/|title=Playing Street Fighter with your face -- and kicking butt|last=NG|first=Alfred|date=7 April 2017|work=CNET|access-date=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the program was initially opened for applications only at certain times of the year, it began being offered year-round from 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2013/12/13/5206786/ablegamers-grant-for-gamers-with-disabilities-now-permanently-open|title=AbleGamers grant for gamers with disabilities now permanently open|last=|first=|date=13 December 2013|work=Polygon|access-date=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charity has opened ''Accessibility Arcade''s in locations such as [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C.'s]] [[Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library]] and the [[University of Toronto]]'s Semaphore Research Cluster, showcasing accessible hardware and games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/10/03/ablegamers-foundation-to-open-first-permanent-accessibility-arc/|title=AbleGamers Foundation to open first permanent 'Accessibility Arcade'|last=Mallory|first=Jordan|date=3 October 2012|work=Engadget|access-date=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/4/22/5639808/accessibility-arcade-university-of-toronto-ablegamers|title=Accessibility Arcade for disabled gamers opens April 26 at the University of Toronto|last=Tach|first=Dave|date=22 April 2014|work=Polygon|access-date=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the charity topped $100,000 [[United States dollar|USD]] in donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/1/10/5296664/ablegamers-2013-donations-100000|title=AbleGamers donations topped $100,000 in 2013|last=Tach|first=Dave|date=10 January 2014|work=Polygon|access-date=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

January 2016 the charity announced that it was extending its mission to include a new program entitled "Expansion Packs". Partnering with sponsors, AbleGamers is building accessible game rooms for activity centers that support people with disabilities, the first being at the Pediatric Specialty Care in Hopewell PA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatricspecialty.com/blog/ablegamers-so-everyone-can-game/|publisher=Pediatric Specialty Care|title=Ablegamers... So Everyone can Game!|date=December 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 AbleGamers started the ''Player Panels'' initiative, whereby gamers with disabilities work with game developers to improve the accessibility of upcoming games, and participate in research studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3204908/gaming/ablegamers-player-panels-could-make-future-games-more-disability-friendly.html|title=AbleGamers' Player Panels could make future games more disability-friendly|last=Chacos|first=Brad|date=29 June 2017|work=PC World|access-date=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AbleGamers Foundation worked with [[Evil Controllers]] to design accessible peripherals for disabled gamers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fletcher |first=JC |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/06/24/adroit-controller-line-to-make-games-more-accessible/|publisher=Massively by Joystiq|title='Adroit' controller line to make games more accessible|date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2018 it was announced that the [[Xbox Adaptive Controller]] had been created in partnership with organisations including AbleGamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/05/17/xbox-adaptive-controller-disabilities-gamepad-microsoft-tour/|title=Xbox Adaptive Controller first look: A new, necessary gamepad|last=Conditt|first=Jessica|date=17 May 2018|work=Engadget|access-date=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Center for Inclusive Play ===
In 2012, The AbleGamers Foundation opened "The AbleGamers Center on Game Accessibility and Inclusive Play" in [[Harpers Ferry]], WV. The center offered a place for people with disabilities to experience new accessible technology as well as a [[Hackerspace|maker space]] for custom controller design and prototyping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mcvuk.com/development/charity-opens-facility-to-help-disabled-gamers|title=Charity opens facility to help disabled gamers|last=Tipps|first=Seth|date=12 September 2013|work=MCV|access-date=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AbleGamers' facility includes a lifesize Songbird from [[BioShock Infinite]] donated to the charity by [[Irrational Games]] in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t96tqd_yx5s|title=Songbird has Landed|last=|first=|date=January 2015|website=YouTube|publisher=AbleGamers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to rare items such as original [[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]] concept art and signed games.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

AbleGamers expanded to a new facility, The AbleGamers Center for Inclusive Play, in [[Charles Town, West Virginia]] in 2017. The building was previously a [[US Coast guard]] facility,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and includes space to hold consultations, demonstrations, and has a [[3D printing]] studio for manufacturing of specialized equipment. It was funded by a grant from Level Access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/27/15451246/ablegamers-new-facility-west-virginia-disabilities|title=AbleGamers opens new facility to help those with disabilities get back in the game|last=Hall|first=Charlie|date=27 April 2017|work=Polygon|access-date=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new facility is a much larger space with more room for AbleGamers to create and display hardware, now has a dedicated [[Streaming media|streaming]] room, and had many features - such as wide doors - which made it beneficial for supporting disabled guests. AbleGamers would like to have facilities in more locations around the United States in the future.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Awards ==
Mark Barlet, president AbleGamers received the 2012 [[American Association of People with Disabilities]] Hearne Leadership Award for his work at AbleGamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aapd.com/what-powers-us/leadership-awards/|publisher=AAPD|title=Meet the 2012 Hearne Leadership Award Winners|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, AbleGamers won an MS Society [[Da Vinci Awards|Da Vinci Award]] for their document "Includification: A Practical Guide to Game Accessibility", the first time the award had been given to a document and concept, not a product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/chapters/MIG/chapter-news/chapter-news-detail/index.aspx?nid=7648|publisher=National MS Society|date=April 2013|title=da Vinci Award Winners announced at gala April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation distributes its own awards each year to the most accessible games released that year, with winners including [[FIFA 13]] and [[Bayonetta 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fifa-13-named-ablegamers-game-of-the-year/1100-6401970/|title=FIFA 13 named AbleGamers Game of the Year|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|date=2 January 2013|work=IGN|access-date=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-01-08-ablegamers-names-bayonetta-2-the-most-accessible-mainstream-game-of-2014|title=AbleGamers names Bayonetta 2 the most accessible mainstream game of 2014|last=Matulef|first=Jeffrey|date=8 January 2015|work=Eurogamer|access-date=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/1/28/5353992/ablegamers-honors-final-fantasy-14-the-stanley-parable|title=AbleGamers honors Final Fantasy 14, The Stanley Parable|last=Tach|first=Dave|date=28 January 2014|work=Polygon|access-date=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards are given to games with customisable control schemes and colors, optional or minimal [[Quick time event|quick time events]], and unique features such as Bayonetta 2's one-button combat mode.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem''''' is an [[action game]] exclusive to the [[PlayStation Portable]], developed by [[Rebellion Developments]] and published by [[Vivendi Games]]. It was released in November 2007 in North America and Europe, and December 2007 in Australia. It is part of the ''[[Alien vs. Predator (franchise)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' franchise, an amalgamation of the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' and ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'' franchises. ''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' is a [[tie-in]] to the [[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem|film of the same title]], which was released shortly after the game.

The game's plot is loosely based on the film, as players take the role of the film's primary [[Predator (alien)|Predator]]. After the events of the [[Alien vs. Predator (film)|first film]] of the ''Alien vs. Predator'' franchise, the Predator has been charged by his society to hunt down and destroy any trace of Alien activity taking place in a small American town, in order to avoid its detection by humanity.

The game received negative reviews from critics and was described as another entry in a long line of poorly developed movie tie-ins. Reviewers enjoyed the opportunity to play as a Predator, but complained that the game was too easy and not rewarding, particularly the simple [[artificial intelligence]] of enemies. The visuals and audio of the game were also considered of poor quality.

==Gameplay==
''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' is a [[Third-person shooter|third-person]] [[action-adventure game]].&lt;ref name="euroreview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/aliens-vs-predator-requiem-review |title=Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem |last=Gibson |first=Ellie |date=December 10, 2007 |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Single-player video game|single-player]] campaign is composed of 15 missions and features the Predator from the film.&lt;ref name="ignreview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/16/aliens-vs-predator-requiem-review-2 |title=Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem Review |last=Miller |first=Greg |date=November 16, 2007 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player has access to Predator weapons as seen in movies and other sources in the franchise, including claws and a shoulder-mounted energy cannon.&lt;ref name="gzreview" /&gt; New weapons from the corresponding film include an energy pistol.&lt;ref name="ignau" /&gt;

==Plot==
The protagonist predator has come to Earth in response to a distress signal from a comrade's ship. Upon his arrival in the small [[Colorado]] town of Gunnison,&lt;ref name="avpinterview" /&gt; he learns that Aliens have begun terrorizing the local populace. His mission is to destroy the Aliens and remove any trace of their activity.&lt;ref name="gspotreview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aliens-vs-predator-requiem-review/1900-6183818/ |title=Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem Review |last=McInnis |first=Shaun |date=December 7, 2007 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reaching his comrades' ship and erasing its traces from Earth, the Predator's only mission is to exterminate all Aliens in the vicinity.&lt;ref name="palgnreview" /&gt;

The Predator travels through rural and urban areas of Gunnison, fighting more Aliens along the way,&lt;ref name="gzreview" /&gt; and occasionally being harassed by human soldiers and civilians.&lt;ref name="pocketreview" /&gt; Finally, the main Alien lair is found in a hospital, where several mines are set by the Predator to bring the Hive down. The game concludes with the final fight against an attacking helicopter and the hospital's destruction. Suddenly, the Alien Queen is seen appearing out of the hospital's rubble, only to be destroyed, along with the entire town, by a nuclear warhead, while the Predator successfully leaves Earth.

We have a strong heritage with the PSP and have done a number of successful titles such as ''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron]]''".&lt;ref name="ignpreview" /&gt; Rebellion decided to forego the [[first-person shooter]] format of their earlier ''Alien vs. Predator'' games and instead focused on a third-person perspective,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/news/aliens-predator-duking-psp |title=Aliens vs. Predator Duking it Out on PSP |last=Kollar |first=Philip |date=August 15, 2007 |publisher=1UP.com |accessdate=August 7, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608052915/http://www.1up.com/news/aliens-predator-duking-psp |archivedate=June 8, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the player taking the role of a lone Predator.&lt;ref name="gzship"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/11_15_07_02_07PM.htm |title=Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem Attacks PSP, Retailers This Holiday |date=November 15, 2007 |publisher=GameZone |accessdate=March 19, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221080832/http://www.gamezone.com/news/11_15_07_02_07PM.htm |archivedate=February 21, 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike previous Rebellion ''Alien vs. Predator'' titles, ''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' does not permit players to take the role of Aliens or human [[Marine (military)|Marines]].&lt;ref name="ignau" /&gt; The company used a [[game engine]] of its own creation, and Hal Zabie, associate producer at Sierra Entertainment, said "...the challenge was to deliver high quality graphics while not sacrificing game performance and this is something that Rebellion achieved and will be noticed by players right away."&lt;ref name="avpinterview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetavp.com/features/interviews/halzabie.shtml |title=Interviews: Hal Zabie |last=Von Kallenback |first=Gareth |date=October 30, 2007 |publisher=Planet AvP |accessdate=August 7, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109001357/http://www.planetavp.com/features/interviews/halzabie.shtml |archivedate=November 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebellion was given materials from the film's production, including footage and the full script, in order to recreate the feel of the film and lend authenticity to the game.&lt;ref name="avpinterview" /&gt; The game's plot is loosely based on the film's,&lt;ref name="gzreview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/aliens_vs_predator_requiem_psp_review |title=Aliens vs. Predator Requiem - PSP - Review |last=Zacarias |first=Eduardo |date=December 9, 2007 |publisher=GameZone |accessdate=August 7, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007003854/http://psp.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r33511.htm |archivedate=October 7, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[player character]] working to remove traces of Alien and Predator presence in a small American town.&lt;ref name="ignpreview" /&gt; Despite similarities to the movie,&lt;ref name="gspotreview" /&gt; the ending is different and the game does not feature the "predalien",&lt;ref name="ignau" /&gt; a Predator-Alien hybrid introduced in ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]''.&lt;ref name="palgnreview" /&gt; The directors of the film, the [[Brothers Strause]], are fans of Rebellion's PC ''Aliens vs. Predator'' game and worked with the studio to develop ''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s premise.&lt;ref name="ignau" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ignpreview" /&gt; In an interview with [[IGN]], Rebellion's Tim Jones said "Fox is very protective of their franchise and take [sic] great care to make sure it is treated properly. We had to work within strict confines to remain consistent with the movie and everything we did had to be approved by the studio."&lt;ref name="ignau" /&gt; The game's system of honor points was considered crucial by Rebellion, who felt that the Predators, despite being the "bad guys", were characterized by a strict [[Honor code|code of honor]].&lt;ref name="ignpreview" /&gt;

{{Quote|"AvP Requiem PSP is set in [[Gunnison, Colorado|Gunnison]], the same small town as seen in the movie. The player assumes the role of the new elite Predator from the film.

Sierra described the game's development as challenging because portable consoles lack the processing power of larger machines.&lt;ref name="avpinterview" /&gt; Rebellion complained about the PSP's lack of a second [[analog stick|analog thumbstick]], stating that it made creating a usable control scheme challenging. They also stated that because the game's protagonist preferred to work alone, ''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' would not contain a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] cooperative mode for the single-player campaign,&lt;ref name="ignau" /&gt; but a "Survival Mode" [[minigame]] would be available where two players could work together to fight Aliens.&lt;ref name="ignpreview" /&gt; The game had a relatively short development cycle,&lt;ref name="avpinterview" /&gt; and was made in less time than the movie.&lt;ref name="ignpreview" /&gt;

''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' was released on November 13, 2007 in North America, over a month ahead of the film's December 25 opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758730/ |title=AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem (2007) |publisher=IMDb |accessdate=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on November 30 in Europe and December 6 in Australia.

''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' received "generally mixed reviews" according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="mcscore" /&gt;  It was considered a poor movie tie-in, an analysis typical of such games.&lt;ref name="palgnreview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gspotreview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1upreview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gplanetreview" /&gt; Reviewers specifically said the game wasn't "bad", just not "good"—[[IGN]], for instance, said, "''AVP'' doesn't suck, but that isn't to say it's good."&lt;ref name="ignreview" /&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s reviewer said, "''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' isn't a terrible game; it's just really mediocre."&lt;ref name="gspotreview" /&gt; [[Eurogamer]]'s Ellie Gibson described the game by referencing a colleague's review of ''[[Miami Vice: The Game]]'', a previous Rebellion PSP title, which stated "&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Miami Vice: The Game'' is&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; one of those games that's not bad, but nor is it ever that good."&lt;ref name="euroreview" /&gt;  The week before the movie's release, ''Requiem'' was listed at #5 on [[GameFly|GameFly's]] most-rented PSP titles list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=16680 |title=GameFly: Holiday Charts Led By ''Assassin's Creed'', ''Mass Effect'' |last=Alexander |first=Leigh |date=December 17, 2007 |publisher=Gamasutra |accessdate=March 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One critique was the game's [[difficulty level]], which was described as too easy.&lt;ref name="gzreview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ignreview" /&gt; [[Gameplanet]] called it "shockingly easy" and claimed that upgrades gained through the honor system made the protagonist invincible rather than stronger.&lt;ref name="gplanetreview" /&gt; Eurogamer noted that "furiously button mashing" was generally sufficient to kill most of the game's enemies.&lt;ref name="euroreview" /&gt;

{{Quote|"Although it's true that a game's difficulty is hardly the sole indicator of its overall quality, every other part of the game is far too mired in blandness to prevent you from drifting off under the spell of mindlessly simple gameplay."|Shaun McInnis, [[GameSpot]]&lt;ref name="gspotreview" /&gt;}}

The [[artificial intelligence]] of the game's enemies, the Aliens, was regarded as lacking,&lt;ref name="euroreview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ignreview" /&gt; and one reviewer noted that their blood was not acidic, a defining characteristic of the creatures from the films.&lt;ref name="gzreview" /&gt; Several reviewers did praise the game's representation of the Predator, however, especially in the early levels.&lt;ref name="palgnreview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gspotreview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gplanetreview" /&gt;
{{quote box|width=40%|align=left|quote="Imagine the pitch: 'Ian Predator and Steve Aliens are two neighbours from very different backgrounds.

The game's graphics and audio were not well-received,&lt;ref name="euroreview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gzreview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="palgnreview" /&gt; with IGN commenting, "There's never a moment that makes you step back and say wow. The textures are muted, the Predator looks alright, but everything is pretty forgettable."&lt;ref name="ignreview" /&gt;

Reviewers also took the opportunity to mock the franchise itself,&lt;ref name="pocketreview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1upreview" /&gt; with Eurogamer suggesting that the series be made into a [[sitcom]].&lt;ref name="euroreview" /&gt; Regarding the multiplayer, IGN's Greg Miller said, "This mode was so boring I made up my own story. I was the Mommy Predator and Ryan from the IGN News Team was the Daddy Predator. We were protecting our children -- the cars in the large empty lot we were running around -- from the aliens."&lt;ref name="ignreview" /&gt; [[1UP.com]]'s Patrick Klepek said, "''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' fails to capitalize on its gaming heritage, instead falling prey to the same substandard licensed schlock we're used to from the films."&lt;ref name="1upreview" /&gt;

An '''analytic narrative''' is a [[social science]] research method seeking to combine historical narratives with the rigor of [[rational choice theory]], particularly through the use of [[game theory]].

The goal of analytic narratives is to provide several forms of discipline on the structure of [[Case study|case studies]], such as a game, out of sample tests, and additional predictions that can be tested even if the main assertion about the case cannot.

Analytic narratives (Bates et al. 1998, 2000; Levi 2002, 2004) involve choosing a problem or [[puzzle]], then building a model to explicate the [[logic]] of an explanation for the puzzle or problem, often in the context of a unique case. The method involves: the use of narrative to elucidate the principal players, their preferences, the key decision points and possibilities, and the rules of game in a textured and sequenced account; and the evaluation of the model through comparative statics and the testable implications the model generates. The analytic narrative approach is most attractive to scholars who seek to evaluate the strength of [[parsimonious]] causal mechanisms in the context of a specific and often unique case. The requirement of explicit formal theorizing (or at least theory that could be formalized) compels scholars to make causal statements and to identify a small number of variables as central to understanding the case.

This approach provides two methods for establishing the generalizability of the theory. First, the model in an analytic narrative often affords a range of explanations and predictions. Although the main account of a unique case may not be testable, the model may yield other predictions that can be tested, either in this case or in other cases. Second, as with other methods, out-of-sample tests constitute an important route to [[generalization]]. The presumption today in social science research is that the authors will provide those tests themselves. However, seldom does the level of knowledge for the out of sample case rival the detailed understanding of the original case that puzzled the author. The demonstration of generalizability must rest on a larger community of scholars who take the findings applicable to one place and time to illuminate a very different place and time.

'''''Arx Fatalis''''' is a [[role-playing video game]]  for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[Microsoft Windows]], released on 12 November 2002 by [[Arkane Studios]], a [[video game developer]] based in [[Lyon, France]].

''Arx Fatalis'' is played from a [[first-person perspective]] and is set on a world whose [[Star|sun]] has failed, forcing the above-ground creatures to take refuge in subterranean [[cavern]]s. One game mechanic is the use of [[mouse gesture]]s to cast spells.

On 14 January 2011, Arkane Studios released a 1.21 patch and the game's [[source code]] under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), though the game assets remain proprietary.

== Plot ==
''Arx Fatalis'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "fatal fortress") is set on a world whose [[Star|sun]] has failed, forcing the above-ground creatures to take refuge in subterranean [[cavern]]s. The action in ''Arx Fatalis'' takes place in one of these large caves, where inhabitants from all races such as [[Trolls]], [[Goblins]], [[dwarf (mythology)|Dwarves]], [[Humans]], etc. have made their homes on various levels of the cave. The player awakens inside a prison cell and, after making his escape, eventually discovers his mission is to subvert and imprison the God of Destruction, Akbaa, who is trying to manifest itself in Arx.

== Gameplay ==

''Arx Fatalis'' has a somewhat open-ended gameplay style, allowing the player to allocate skill points for the character type such as [[spellcasting]], [[weapon]]s and [[armor]], [[wikt:stealth|stealth]], and so on. There are several side quests that can be undertaken. Simple [[crafting]] involves enchanting ammunition and weapons, or creating items, such as a [[fishing rod]] (fishing pole and rope), [[keyring]]s (key and ring), or [[pie]]s (dough and [[rolling pin]], optional [[apple]] and optional [[Wine|bottle of wine]]). Raw food can be cooked, like [[bread|rounds of bread]], [[chicken drumstick]]s, or pies. The main plotline is non-linear with the player collecting the various items to forge a sword required to defeat Akbaa in a [[boss battle|final showdown]]. Additional goals come up such as dealing with the rebels of Arx, the snake women and The King of Arx. The player can resolve the conflict between them all and experience several different endings to the conflict with different consequences somewhat affecting the story.

There is no dialogue system in Arx Fatalis. Rather, the player is able to make choices through actions which lead to different consequences. There are also multiple ways to finish quests and the player can progress through the game in several different ways. For example, the player can use force to kill enemies and break down doors, or they can use stealth and avoid enemies.

One of the intuitive interfaces in Arx Fatalis is the spellcasting system. Using the [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] and the [[Control key|Ctrl]] key, [[runes]] are drawn in mid-air with [[mouse gesture]]s, which must be correctly drawn, in order to successfully cast a spell. The player can find or buy different runes as gameplay progresses, combinations of which unlock new spells.

This gestural interface was simplified in the Xbox version to account for the limitations of the joypad. Each direction of the directional pad corresponds to a different mouse direction and different combinations of directions are entered with the directional pad to draw runes and correspondingly cast spells. A queue of up to 3 spells can be cast in advance, ready to be activated at the press of a button. There is also an instant magic mode that allows the player to simply select the desired spell they want to cast from a list of learned spells during gameplay.

In addition, Arx supports a stealth mode that is active when a stealth icon is visible on the interface. In stealth mode, usually when a player is in dark or shadowy areas, [[non-player characters]] cannot see them.

== Development ==

The design of ''Arx Fatalis'' was influenced by games from the now-defunct [[Looking Glass Studios]], especially ''[[Ultima Underworld]]''. Arkane Studios have stated that ''Arx Fatalis'' was intended to be ''Ultima Underworld III'',&lt;ref name="license discussion"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arx-fatalis-preview/1100-2856384/ |title=GameSpot Preview |work=[[GameSpot]]|author=Brett Todd |date=21 March 2002 |accessdate=2018-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412013415/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arx-fatalis-preview/1100-2856384/ | archive-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; however while [[Raphaël Colantonio]] had support from [[Paul Neurath]], one of the original developers of ''Ultima Underworld'', [[Electronic Arts]], who owned the rights, would not allow Arkane to make a sequel with their intellectual property unless he accepted some of their provisions. Colantonio refused to accept this and instead had Arkane set out on the game in the spirit of ''Ultima Underworld''.&lt;ref name="polygon history1"/&gt; Colantonio had difficulty in getting a publisher; with finances nearly exhausted, they had signed one small publisher who had gone bankrupt within the month, but later secured [[JoWooD Productions]] for publication, eventually releasing in 2002. While the game was well received, it was considered a commercial failure.&lt;ref name="polygon history1"/&gt;

''Arx Fatalis'' was released for Microsoft Windows on 28 June 2002 and for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] in 23 December 2003. In April 2007 ''Arx Fatalis'' was released on the [[digital distribution]] platform [[Steam (software)|Steam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamershell.com/news_37623.html|title=News: Arx Fatalis On Steam Now|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[GOG.com]] in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.develop-online.net/press-releases/42722/Arx-Fatalis Straight out of the Dungeon, Arx Fatalis invades GOG.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the game was well received, it was considered a commercial failure.&lt;ref name="polygon history1"/&gt; ''Arx Fatalis'' received generally favorable reviews from critics having an average rating of 80% on [[GameRankings]] for the Microsoft Windows Version,&lt;ref name="RevGRPC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/371212-arx-fatalis/index.html|title=Arx Fatalis|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 72.61% for Xbox version,&lt;ref name="RevGRXbox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox/914557-arx-fatalis/index.html|title=Arx Fatalis|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively a score of 77 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] for the Microsoft Windows Version,&lt;ref name="RevMCPC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/arx-fatalis|title=Arx Fatalis|work=Metacritic|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 71 out of 100 on Xbox version.&lt;ref name="RevMCXbox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox/arx-fatalis|title=Arx Fatalis|work=Metacritic|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Arx Fatalis'' was released after ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'' and ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'', with reviewers stating that although it is not so open like ''Morrowind'' it will appeal to the fans that like Dungeon Crawler RPG{{'}}s, paying homage to games like ''Ultima:Underworld''.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
[[GameSpot]]'s [[Greg Kasavin]] was pleased with the experience that the game offers, stating that "''Arx Fatalis'' is entertaining and great looking, and it should especially appeal to fans of other atmospheric first-person games, including ''[[Thief: The Dark Project]]'', ''[[System Shock 2]]'', and ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'', let alone this year's ''Morrowind''. Though marred by some technical issues (many of which have already been addressed by patches) and at times confusing to navigate in, ''Arx Fatalis'' nevertheless delivers a memorable, original role-playing experience",{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} and [[IGN]]'s Dan Adams overall enjoying the game stating that "The atmosphere, spell system, puzzles, voices, and story were good and interesting enough to give me a pretty enjoyable experience."{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
Although critics pointed out the visuals not being very appealing and the sound being like a "mixed bag" with "Some of the voice work is very good with particularly the main character's detached and distant voice, which makes more sense when you learn his identity. While some of the races had fairly cheesy voices."{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

''Arx Fatalis'' was nominated as 2002's best computer role-playing game by ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', [[GameSpot]] and the [[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences]].&lt;ref name=aias2002&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040404185448/http://interactive.org/awards/IAA-6/winners.asp |url=http://interactive.org:80/awards/IAA-6/winners.asp |title=6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards: Winners |publisher=[[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences]] |archivedate=4 April 2004 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all |access-date=10 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gamespot2002&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030207155400/http://gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/bestof2002/ |url=http://gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/bestof2002/ |title=GameSpot's Best and Worst of 2002 | author=GameSpot Staff | work=[[GameSpot]] |archivedate=7 February 2003 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cgwpremier2002&gt;{{cite journal | author=Staff | journal=[[Computer Gaming World]] | title=''Computer Gaming World''{{'}}s 2002 Games of the Year |date=April 2003 | issue=225 | pages=83–86, 88, 89, 92–97 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a runner-up for [[RPG Vault]]'s "Surprise of the Year" and "Debut Game of the Year" awards,&lt;ref name=rpgvault2002 /&gt; and for GameSpot's "Best Sound" and the [[Game Developers Choice Awards]]' "Rookie Studio of the Year" prizes.&lt;ref name=gamespot2002 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gdca2002&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamechoiceawards.com/archive/gdca_3rd.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703082229/http://www.gamechoiceawards.com/archive/gdca_3rd.html | archivedate=July 3, 2011 | title=Archive &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; 3rd Annual Game Developers Choice Awards | publisher=[[Game Developers Conference]] | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it did win RPG Vault's award for sound design that year.&lt;ref name=rpgvault2002&gt;{{cite web | author=Staff | url=http://rpgvault.ign.com:80/articles/382/382567p1.html | title=2002 RPG Vault Awards | work=[[RPG Vault]] | date=January 13, 2003 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918055234/http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/382/382567p1.html | archivedate=18 September 2007 | access-date=10 September 2018 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The editors of ''Computer Gaming World'' wrote that ''Arx Fatalis'' "has hands-down the most annoying interface of the year, but fortunately, it also sports sharp graphics [...] and a great story".&lt;ref name=cgwpremier2002 /&gt;

==Legacy==
''Arx Fatalis''{{'s}} critical praise gave Arkane the opportunity for them to work with [[Valve Corporation]] to develop a new title on their [[Source (game engine)|Source engine]], and Colantonio opted to make a sequel, ''Arx Fatalis 2''. However, the poor sales of the first game made it difficult to find a publisher; They were approached by [[Ubisoft]] and asked to apply the ''Arx Fatalis'' game engine to their ''[[Might and Magic]]''. This became ''[[Dark Messiah of Might and Magic]]'', released in October 2006. It refined the first-person melee combat of ''Arx Fatalis'' with a lesser emphasis on role-playing elements.&lt;ref name="polygon history1"/&gt; During this time, Colantonio moved from France to Austin, Texas leaving the main studio in the hands of his colleagues while he set up Arkane Austin in June 2006.&lt;ref name="polygon history1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2012/9/28/3425300/the-mirror-men-of-arkane | title= The Mirror Men of Arkane | first = Russ | last= Pitts | date = 27 June 2012 | accessdate = 17 April 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernard H. Paul''' (April 22, 1907 – September 18, 2005) was a [[puppeteer]] best known for his traveling show and television broadcasts of "Paul's Puppets". His marionette show ran for 10 years on [[WBAL-TV]] in [[Baltimore]]. In 1931 he performed the first known children's television show.

Paul also did the first professional puppet show for a United States president when he performed at the [[White House]] for [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and his wife in 1934.

== Early life ==
[[File:Bernard Paul, c. 1912.PNG|thumb|left|180px|Bernard Paul, {{circa|1912}}]]
Bernard Paul was born on April 22, 1907, in Baltimore, Maryland, the only child of Henry James Paul and Mary Paul. He was born in a private hospital called Bidler and Sellman. He went by the nickname "Bernie". The family lived in Baltimore on Lanvale Street for a while and later moved to a house on Gilmore Street.

They moved to a neighborhood called [[Linthicum, Maryland|Linthicum Heights]] in 1919 when Paul was 12 years old. Paul's father designed and built the house that was located on Hawthorne Road. That homesite had many flower and vegetable gardens.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen&gt;{{cite news |last= Rasmussen |first=Frederick N. |date=September 20, 2005 |title= Operated puppet troupe for 22 years on WBAL-TV|url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-09-20/news/0509200093_1_puppet-paul-was-born-edee |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |location=Baltimore, MD |access-date=November 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sarg&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thestoriesbetween.com/stories/bernard-paul |title= Bernard &amp; Edith Paul|last1= Perfetti  |first1=Sharon |last2= |first2= |date=2015 |website= |publisher=The Stories Between |access-date=November 28, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul attended Linthicum Elementary School, where he first met his future wife, Edith "Edee" Rogers.&lt;ref name=Sarg /&gt;{{clear left}}

== Education and marriage ==
After Paul's graduation from the eighth grade his family had moved out of the area where Edith lived and he lost contact with her at this time. Paul had then attended Baltimore City College for a year. For the next three years he then went to Severn Preparatory School in [[Severna Park, Maryland]], from which he graduated in 1925. Paul then enrolled at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] (MICA) where he was reunited with Edee. He studied [[stagecraft]] and she was a student of costume design and became a professional [[seamstress]]. They graduated from MICA in 1929.&lt;ref name=drawers&gt;ProQuest (909635346), ''The Baltimore Sun'', "Couple keeps friends in drawers, in strings" by Donna Weaver (27 April 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul and Edee were married on April 17, 1930, in his parents' home on Hawthorne Road in Linthicum. They lived there for their entire lives. They had two sons who were raised there as the third generation in the same house. Peter Darr was their first son, born on January 21, 1933. Larry Ramon was their second child, born on July 10, 1935.&lt;ref name=Sarg/&gt;

== Career ==
Paul had changed his mind of becoming a college-trained professional in stagecraft sometime in the late 1920s. This happened after seeing a puppet performance of [[Tony Sarg]] at [[Goucher College]]. He then decided on a career in puppetry.&lt;ref name=Sarg/&gt; Paul associated himself with Sarg and obtained [[marionette]] puppet ideas and skills. In a short time they became friends. From Sarg's unique training he and his wife learned to stage puppet shows at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]]. The faculty was so impressed with their performances that they began teaching puppetry,&lt;ref name=Rasmussen/&gt; and a teaching stint spanning almost two decades followed.&lt;ref name=ArtPrice&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artprice.com/artist/193684/bernard-h-paul/biography |title=Bernard H.

== Paul's Puppets ==
[[File:Pauls with puppets.jpg|thumb|The Pauls manipulating their puppets in December 1949]]
Paul, along with his wife Edee, started a traveling puppet show in 1930 called Paul's Puppets. With their combined puppetry talents they managed every step of the process for each performance. Paul, with his skills, designed and built the puppet sets and marionettes. Edee created the puppets' scripts and their costumes. Paul had a separate 45' by 16' workshop studio that was part of their personal residence he added in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;ProQuest (1637460113), ''The Baltimore Sun'' (15 Jan 1989) "Puppeteers spread good cheer" by Jill L Zarend&lt;/ref&gt; In the studio he created the marionettes that were made from pine, which included the flexible wooden joints for the puppets. The marionette heads were from plaster wood. The rough block heads were individually crafted, specifically shaped, finished, painted up, and decorated with hair. His wife would add her custom-designed costumes just before being attached to an overhead controller by strings.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen/&gt;

Paul's Puppets consisted of a company of some 500 marionettes, including animals, fairies, giants, princes, princesses and soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;ProQuest (542342634), ''The Baltimore Sun'', 14 Feb 1960, "The Biggest family in Maryland" by Gerald H. Borstel&lt;/ref&gt; The performances were adaptations of the [[Arabian Nights]], [[Aesop's fables]], [[Daniel Defoe]], [[Beatrix Potter]], [[John Ruskin]], [[Mark Twain]] and [[Hans Christian Andersen]] fairy tales. Other plays were of Snow White, Red Riding Hood, Butterfly that Stamped, Undersen and Taps, and The Wizard Prince.&lt;ref&gt;ProQuest (540624352),'' The Baltimore Sun'' (April 6, 1930) "Marionettes play at Guild Theater".&lt;/ref&gt; The performances represented countries from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;ProQuest (539569700), ''The Baltimore Sun'', "Marionettes on Display at Institute – represents many countries" (16 Nov 1930).&lt;/ref&gt;

The marionette puppets were carefully stored when not performing. A son had noted that the family could never play with the hand-crafted marionettes because they were stage props and not children's toys. The performances in the first years had musical accompaniment from [[78-rpm record]]s. The sound effect techniques improved later and included music tapes. Paul and his wife were the voices for their marionette characters.&lt;ref name=drawers/&gt;

Paul worked as an assistant Post Master at a U.S. Post Office in 1940 giving puppet shows with his marionettes on his off times. The Pauls did performances at Army posts and aboard Navy ships during World War II. They also did puppet acts on college campuses, in retail store windows, at country clubs, local schools and churches. Notable performances they did later consisted of one in an opera at the [[Peabody Conservatory]] and another in a Shakespeare play.&lt;ref&gt;ProQuest (543298422), ''The Baltimore Sun'', "Vagabonds to Produce Play by Shakespeare" (16 October 1932)&lt;/ref&gt; In their performances they mocked things like candy, politicians, and Social Security.&lt;ref name= Rasmussen/&gt;

The Pauls started television for WMAR in late 1947 when they did a commercial with their marionettes.&lt;ref name=Sarg/&gt; Paul's Puppets then made a 15-minute debut on WBAL-TV on January 8, 1948, in preparation for a twice-weekly show that ran for ten years.&lt;ref name=Capital&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.capitalgazette.com/neighborhoods/ph-ac-gn-linthicum-0704-20150701-story.html |title=Linthicum: Local woman creates a way to crowdsource memories |last1= Turner |first1=Phil |last2= |first2= |date= July 1, 2015 |newspaper=[[Maryland Gazette|Capital Gazette]] |publisher=Baltimore Sun Media Group  |access-date=November 28, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sponsored by [[Hutzler's]] department store. Other sponsors were [[Nestlé|Nestle's Ever Ready Sweet Milk Cocoa]] and [[Planters|Planters Peanuts]]. The first shows came with theme music of "March of the Little Fawns". The later ones came with music from [[The Nutcracker]]. Paul once told a friend that though the television show was considered a success, he missed having a live audience. One noted marionette character that many remember was JoJo. It was a red, white, and blue clown puppet that had interviews with audience children as the master of ceremonies before going "live" with the show.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-12-06/news/1990340152_1_puppet-pauls-jo |title=TV puppeteers taught a generation |last1=Kelly |first1=Jacques |last2= |first2= |date=December 6, 1990 |website= |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |access-date=November 28, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WBAL began showing the performances in color in 1955. In 1957 the station changed its programming to a news-weather program in Paul's Puppets evening time period. The puppet performances were moved to a morning time slot and the show floundered because the targeted audience of children were in school. Their television career ended in 1958, but they still did live performances at the Hutzler's stores.&lt;ref name=Sarg/&gt;

The Pauls made display windows in later years for department stores like [[Hochschild Kohn's|Hochschild]]'s and [[Hutzler]]'s. The display windows consisted of still doll-like figures that did not move as their marionette puppets did. One display was of the [[coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth]]. Another store display showed shoppers on Howard Street in Baltimore at the turn of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;

== Hobbies ==
Paul had several hobbies. Among them were carving, collecting, photography, making jewelry and [[woodworking]]. He was a collector with wide-ranging interests, including bells and gongs, butterflies, buttons, masks, old music boxes, swords, Oriental objects, toy soldiers and ancient puppets. He had a [[Darkroom|photography darkroom]] in his house and developed his own pictures.&lt;ref name=Sarg/&gt;

== Retirement and death ==
The Pauls performed puppet shows in schools, hospitals and department stores until retiring in 1981. Paul's wife died on November 2, 1993. Paul remained at the Hawthorne Road home in Linthicum until he was 96. He then moved to an assisted living facility. Paul died on September 18, 2005, at the age of 98.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sarg/&gt;

== Legacy ==
Paul and his wife had a television career in the Baltimore area for ten years on TV stations WBAL and WMAR. Their puppet show was the first Baltimore color television show. It was also chosen to be in the first edition of TV Guide for Baltimore as the featured program. Paul was a guest on the American television panel game show ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' on March 19, 1965. Since he misspelled the name of a well-known puppet, none of the panelists guessed he was Bernard H. Paul of Paul's Puppets.&lt;ref name=Sarg/&gt;

Paul performed the first known children's television show.{{sfn|McPharlin|1969|p=453}}{{sfn|Davis|1995|p=1}}{{sfn|Robertson|2011|p=795}}&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waynet.org/talk/talk/messages/15/78.html?967072844 |title=Charles Francis Jenkins |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2015 |website=Al McGilvray |publisher= Waynet, Inc. |access-date= November 28, 2015 |quote= His station W3XK, also produced the first children's show on 11/6/1931, hosted by Bernard H.

The '''Broadcasting and Entertainment Trades Alliance''' (BETA) was a short-lived [[United Kingdom|British]] [[entertainment]] [[trade union]].  It was founded in 1984 with the merger of the [[Association of Broadcasting Staff]] and the [[National Association of Theatrical Television and Kine Employees]].

The union appointed two General Secretaries, [[Tony Hearn]] and [[John Wilson (trade unionist)|John Wilson]]; Wilson standing down in 1987.

In 1991, BETA merged with the [[Association of Cinematograph Television and Allied Technicians]] to form the [[Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union]].

This article gives some details of the various '''catalogues of classical compositions''' that have come into general use.

==Opus numbers==
While the [[opus number]]ing system has long been the standard manner in which individual compositions are identified and referenced, it is far from universal, and there have been many different applications of the system. Very few composers gave opus numbers to all of their published works without exception:
* Some composers used it for certain genres of music but not for others (for example, in [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s time, it was normal to apply opus numbers to instrumental compositions but not to vocal compositions such as operas, oratorios, etc.).
* Some composers gave opus numbers to some of their early compositions but abandoned the practice after some time (examples include [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] and [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]]).
* Some used it in a very erratic manner, or were subject to the wishes of their publishers, who for commercial reasons often presented works with opus numbers that bore little relationship to their place in the chronological sequence of the composer's works. In cases such as [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], one opus number could refer to a number of different works; or a single work could appear under different opus numbers.
* Some composers abandoned their early compositions and restarted the opus numbering sequence. Some did this more than once. For example, [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] three times started numbering his works with opus numbers. He stopped the system in 1921 because of the difficulty of distinguishing between original works and ethnographic arrangements, and between major and minor works.
* A few composers allowed superstitious considerations to override chronological specificity in numbering: [[Jules Massenet|Massenet]], for this reason, published an "Opus 12B" but not an "Opus 13."{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

There are cases where works that a composer chose not to publish were published after their death and assigned very late opus numbers that often give a misleading idea of their order of composition (cases include [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]).

Other composers simply never used opus numbers at all (examples include [[Aaron Copland|Copland]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]] and many other 20th-century composers).

In some cases, the opus numbers that were established during the composer's lifetime are still used, but symbols from alternative comprehensive catalogues are used for unpublished works or works that have come to light since the composer's death.

==Comprehensive catalogues==
For the above and other reasons, musicologists have often found it necessary to produce comprehensive catalogues that incorporate the most up-to-date information available about the composers' works. These catalogues sometimes also include unpublished sketches, incomplete drafts, even doubtful works and those known to have been spuriously attributed, as well as writings and other non-musical output.

When such a catalogue finds general acceptance, the sequence numbers allocated by the author then become the standard way of referencing the composer's works, and these numbers usually supersede the opus numbers (if any) that were previously used.

Some such catalogues are organised in a single chronological sequence; others are divided into different genres and listed chronologically within each genre; others are alphabetically arranged. [[Thematic catalogue]] indicates a catalogue with a music example ([[incipit]]/theme) for each entry, usually represented on one or two staves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Erich Deutsch]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=SL3VXT875IQC ''The Schubert Thematic Catalogue.''] New York: [[Dover Publications]], 1995. {{ISBN|0486286851}} – {{ISBN|9780486286853}} pp. ix ff.&lt;/ref&gt; A symbol is chosen to represent the catalogue as a whole, and this is usually the initial of the author's or the composer's surname, or an abbreviation of the title of the catalogue itself. In a small number of cases, different symbols apply to different parts of the catalogue.

Among the most famous examples of this are:
* the '''[[BWV]]''' numbers allocated to [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s works in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]] (Bach Works List) developed by [[Wolfgang Schmieder]]. They are also sometimes referred to by their '''S'''&amp;nbsp;numbers (after Schmieder)
* the '''K''' numbers allocated to [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s works in the [[Köchel catalogue]], created by [[Ludwig Ritter von Köchel]]. In Germany and other parts of Europe, the symbol used is '''KV''', for [[Köchel-Verzeichnis]] (Köchel List)
* the '''{{D.}}''' numbers allocated to [[Franz Schubert]]'s works in the [[Deutsch catalogue]], developed by [[Otto Erich Deutsch]]

In some cases, both the opus number ''and'' the newer catalogue designation are sometimes appended to a work. For example, Schubert's first set of [[Impromptus (Schubert)|Impromptus]] was published as Op. 90 and is now catalogued as {{D.|number=899}}, but concert programmes, CDs and reference works commonly refer to Schubert's "Impromptus, Op. 90, D. 899".

Some catalogues have appendixes ({{lang-de|Anhang}}, abbreviated as Anh.) for doubtful and/or spurious works, arrangements, etc.

==Thematic catalogue==
A '''thematic catalogue''' is an index used to identify musical compositions through the citation of the opening notes ([[incipit (music)|incipit]]) and/or main theme(s) of the work and/or of its movements or main sections.&lt;ref&gt;Grier, James, 'Thematic catalogue'. In ''The Oxford Companion to Music'' ([[Oxford University Press]])&lt;/ref&gt; Such catalogues can be used for many purposes, including as guides to a specific composer's works, as an inventory of a library's holding or as an advertisement of a publisher's output. In addition to the musical identification, a thematic catalogue may continue information such as dates of composition and first performance. Works within a thematic catalogue can be grouped chronologically or by genre.

Thematic catalogues produced as scholarly guides to the works of a particular composer provide a shorthand means of identification for their music. The [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]] (BWV) numbering system used for the works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] is one example.

==Multiple catalogues==
In a number of cases, more than one catalogue exists, or has existed, for the same composer's works. In most such cases, only one will be considered the current standard catalogue for the purposes of musicological indexing. For example, [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s works are now known only by S numbers, from the catalogue by [[Humphrey Searle]], which superseded that created by [[Peter Raabe]], which used R numbers.  Older catalogues are included for [[historiography|historiographic]] purposes.

But there are exceptions to this, such as:
* For [[Domenico Scarlatti]], the [[Alessandro Longo|Longo]] catalogue ('''L''' numbers) was in use from 1906, and although it has become generally superseded by the 1953 [[Ralph Kirkpatrick|Kirkpatrick]] catalogue ('''K''' or '''Kk''' numbers), L numbers are still seen in references. In 1967, [[Giorgio Pestelli|Pestelli]] created a third catalogue ('''P''' numbers), which has found acceptance in some places. Because all three symbols are often encountered, there is a [[List of solo keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti|concordance]] to help navigate between them.
*[[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s works can appear with an '''opus''' number, a '''WoO''' number, a '''Hess''' number or a '''Bia''' number (see [[Catalogues of Beethoven compositions]]). Until 1955, the opus numbers that appeared in the [[Beethoven Gesamtausgabe]] were used exclusively, but this edition omitted a large number of works. In 1955, Georg Kinsky and Hans Helm produced a listing of works that had not been given opus numbers, and gave them [[WoO (Beethoven)|WoO]] numbers (''Werke ohne Opuszahl'', or "Works without opus number"). This listing is often referred to as the Kinsky Catalogue. In 1957, [[Willy Hess (composer)|Willy Hess]] produced a new catalogue of Beethoven's unpublished works, which included all or most of the Kinsky Catalogue as well as other pieces; Hess numbers were allocated to this sequence of works. In 1968, Giovanni Biamonti produced the [[Biamonti Catalogue]], which sought to combine and update all pre-existing catalogues. Bia numbers relate to this catalogue.
** Note: The WoO symbol has also been used to classify some other composers' works that were not given opus numbers, such as certain works by [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]].
* In [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]'s case, at least three latter-day catalogues vie for prominence: Maurice J. E. Brown ('''B''' numbers); [[Krystyna Kobylańska]] ('''KK''' numbers); and [[Józef Michał Chomiński]], whose catalogue is segmented into six parts, each part utilising a different letter ('''A, C, D, E, P''' and '''S'''). Hence, a work of Chopin can be referred to by its opus number and/or a catalogue number preceded by one of eight letter symbols.
* The cataloguing of [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]]'s works is similarly complex. Bartók assigned opus numbers to his works three times. He ended this practice with the Violin Sonata No. 1, Op. 21 in 1921, because of the difficulty of distinguishing between original works and ethnographic arrangements, and between major and minor works. Since his death, three attempts—two full and one partial—have been made at cataloguing. The first, and still most widely used, is [[András Szőllősy]]'s chronological '''Sz''' numbers, from 1 to 121. [[Denijs Dille]] subsequently reorganised the juvenilia (Sz. 1–25) thematically, as '''DD''' numbers 1 to 77. The most recent catalogue is that of [[László Somfai]]; this is a chronological index with works identified by '''BB''' numbers 1 to 129, incorporating corrections based on the Béla Bartók Thematic Catalogue.

| Terry; W
| 2nd edition with a new foreword by H.C. Robbins-Landon&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Bach's works are mostly referred to by the opus number assigned by the original publishers, which can cause misidentification because different, secondary publishers used the same (original) opus number (such as using Op. 18 to identify three different sets of J. C. Bach works). Moreover, three of six Op. 6 symphonies are identified as Op. 8, but in a different order. Because of this confusion, the ''de facto'' standard catalogue is '''''John Christian Bach''''', by C. S. Terry (2nd ed. 1967). When identifying a J. C. Bach work, one cites the page and incipit numbers "in Terry", although they are not catalogue numbers per se. A short list of the Terry numbers is in ''The New Grove Bach Family'', by Christoph Wolff, et al. (pp.&amp;nbsp;341ff., NY: Norton, 1983). Also used are the opus numbers of the "Thematic Catalog" in the ''Collected Works of Johann Christian Bach'' (Ernest Warburton, ed.; NY: Garland Publishing, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, some more works were published in 1855 and 1857 as Opp. posth. 66–74. Yet more works were later published, but without opus numbers; some of these were known in Chopin's lifetime, while others have come to light only since his death. At least three major attempts have been made to catalogue all Chopin's works systematically, and each catalogue has its own numbering system. Maurice J. E. Brown uses B numbers, [[Krystyna Kobylańska]] uses KK numbers, and Józef Michał Chomiński allocates numbers to a variety of letters (A, C, D, E, P and S). These alternative designations are generally used to identify only the works that were not given opus numbers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourchopin.com/list.html Our Chopin]&lt;/ref&gt;

| K or KV
| Mozart's opus numbers are particularly scattered and useless and are no longer used at all (for instance, there are two sets of violin sonatas both called Op. 1). Köchel's '''''Chronologisch-thematisches Verzeichnis sämmtlicher Tonwerke W. A. Mozarts''''' was published in 1862 and has been substantially revised four times since then. KV numbers (short for Köchel-Verzeichnis) are often used for Mozart's works in Europe.

Two volumes of a catalogue of the remaining works were published by Erich Hermann Mueller von Asow (1892–1964) in 1959. After von Asow's death, Franz Trenner (d. 1993) and Alfons Ott (d. 1976) published the third volume, based on von Asow's notes; this catalogue lists 323 titles, including Strauss's literary writings. The numbers for compositions from this catalogue have '''AV''' numbers. During the 15 years it took to publish von Asow's work, many new sources became available, so Trenner created a new chronological catalogue in 1985. An updated edition was published in 1993, and his son Florian Trenner published a completely revised edition in 1999; this catalogue lists 298 works and it uses '''TrV''' numbers.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Catherine'''''{{efn|{{nihongo||キャサリン|Kyasarin}}&lt;!-- See [[WP:JFN]] --&gt;}} is a [[puzzle platformer]] video game developed by [[Atlus]]. The game was released by Atlus for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in Japan and North America in 2011, and in [[PAL region]]s by [[Deep Silver]] the following year. The story follows Vincent Brooks, a man who is beset by supernatural nightmares while torn between his feelings for longtime girlfriend Katherine and the similarly-named beauty Catherine. The gameplay is divided between daytime hours, where Vincent interacts with the characters, and his dreams where he must navigate three-dimensional tower puzzles. The game's ending is affected by moral choices made by Vincent over the course of the story.

''Catherine'' was developed by the same studio behind the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, including producer and director [[Katsura Hashino]], character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]], and music composer [[Shoji Meguro]]. The game began production near the end of ''[[Persona 4]]''{{'s}} development in 2008, with the aim being to create something different from the ''Persona'' series, being aimed more at an adult audience. The English localization was handled by [[Atlus USA]], with the English actors being allowed to adlib some lines.

Reception was generally positive, with critics praising its mature subject matter and gameplay, despite criticism towards its high difficulty. Several journalists also commented on its representation of gender stereotypes. It exceeded Atlus' sales expectations by having sold over half a million units worldwide by the end of 2011. ''Catherine: Full Body'', a remaster featuring an additional love interest named Rin, will be released for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[PlayStation Vita]] in 2019.

During the daytime, Vincent will converse with his friends as well as try to handle his relationships with Catherine and Katherine. Most of this time takes place in the Stray Sheep bar where Vincent can save and send text messages from his mobile phone, talk to customers, order drinks, play a minigame titled ''Rapunzel'' or listen to a jukebox containing tracks from other Atlus games such as the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/xbox360/catherine/news/new-mini-games-revealed-for-catherine/a-2011020217623268063/g-2010081911452055090|title=New mini-games revealed for Catherine|first=Ryan|last=Winterhalter|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=February 2, 2011|accessdate=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main gameplay takes place in the Nightmare stages. In a nightmarish dreamworld inhabited by other men, who are represented as [[anthropomorphic]] sheep, Vincent must climb up giant staircases that are slowly collapsing underneath him and safely reach the top. To accomplish this, Vincent must push, pull and climb blocks as quickly as possible while avoiding various traps such as spikes and ice. Climbing up steps in quick succession increases a score multiplier, and at the end of the level, players are given an award based on their score. Each stage is split up into numerous areas, culminating in a boss stage in which a nightmarish creature also attempts to kill Vincent. Vincent can move faster depending on how much alcohol he drinks during the day and can earn pillows that allow him to retry levels. There are also several items which can be found or purchased in between stages, such as spare blocks, lightning which removes enemies and energy drinks that allow Vincent to climb more steps at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2010/11/30/catherine_drinks/ |title=All About Catherine's Drinks |publisher=Andriasang.com |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707142201/http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2010/11/30/catherine_drinks/ |archivedate=July 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent will die if he falls off the bottom of the level, gets caught by a trap or is killed by a boss, with the game ending if Vincent runs out of retry pillows. In between action stages, Vincent can interact with the other sheep, save his game, learn techniques or spend coins on special items. When playing on easy and normal difficulty, players can push the Select/Back button to correct a single block move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mike Fahey |url=http://kotaku.com/5725398/catherine-gameplay-is-quite-puzzling |title=Catherine Gameplay Is Quite Puzzling |publisher=Kotaku.com |date=January 5, 2011 |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/692qj7KFC?url=http://kotaku.com/5725398/catherine-gameplay-is-quite-puzzling |archivedate=July 10, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/catherine-video-full-access-preview/a-2011012714652287090|title=Catherine video – Full Access Preview|first=Chris|last=Antista|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=January 26, 2011|accessdate=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the game, the choices the player makes during certain sections of the game will affect the development of Vincent's character and the route the story takes place. This is represented by a morality meter, which can change in several ways, such as how Vincent types out a text message to one of the girls, how he answers certain questions and how he converses with non-playable characters. The game features [[Nonlinear gameplay|multiple endings]] based on the route Vincent takes, and has over twenty hours of gameplay.&lt;ref name="Multiple Endings"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scrawlfx.com/2010/08/catherine-is-twenty-hours-long-has-multiple-endings |title=Catherine is twenty-hours long, has multiple endings |first=Sal |last=Romano |date=August 27, 2010 |work= |publisher=Scrawl |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829024047/http://scrawlfx.com/2010/08/catherine-is-twenty-hours-long-has-multiple-endings |archivedate=August 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GRadar/&gt; In addition to the Golden Playhouse mode, Babel Mode features four large stages playable with up to two players, while Vs Colosseum features two players simultaneously playing a stage in order to reach the top first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/285619/news/multiplayer-detailed-for-atlus-catherine/|title=Multiplayer detailed for Atlus' 'Catherine'|first=Mike|last=Jackson|work=[[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]]|date=January 27, 2011|accessdate=February 15, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130061845/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/285619/news/multiplayer-detailed-for-atlus-catherine/|archivedate=January 30, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Setting and characters===
''Catherine'' takes place in an undefined North American city. The plot is presented as a [[story within a story]] told through ''Golden Playhouse'', a television program described as "like a Saturday morning theatre, with a bit of a ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' vibe".&lt;ref name="PSBlogCath"/&gt; A key location in the game is the Stray Sheep Bar, where the main cast meet up on a regular basis and acting as the stage for the game's major events.&lt;ref name="CathBook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CathCharactersStray"/&gt;  The story remains the same up to the ending, which varies based upon the choices Vincent has made in both the real world and the Nightmare realm.&lt;ref name="PSBlogCath"/&gt; The plot of ''Catherine'' focuses on three main characters:&lt;ref name="CathGemProfiles"/&gt;
* {{nihongo|'''Vincent Brooks'''|ヴィンセント・ブルックス|Vinsento Burukkusu}}, the main protagonist, is a 32-year-old systems engineer [[salaryman]], described as in between independence from his family and getting married. A lifelong bachelor, he lacks any kind of ambition and chooses to avoid the problems of adult life such as his career and possible future marriage, wanting to live a bachelor life as long as possible.&lt;ref name="CathGemProfiles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FamStaffComments"/&gt; Vincent is voiced by [[Koichi Yamadera]] in Japanese,&lt;ref name="FamStaffComments"/&gt; and [[Troy Baker]] in English.&lt;ref name="SilLocalVoiceDirector"/&gt;
* {{nihongo|'''Catherine'''|キャサリン|Kyasarin}}, a 22-year-old beauty who seemingly bumps into Vincent in the bar by accident, and ends up spending the night with him. This encounter, and her continued attempts to romance him, become the catalyst for the game's events. Outwardly Catherine is a playful, seductive and free spirited young woman; in reality, she is a [[succubus]] who tempts men for her own ends.&lt;ref name="CathBook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CathGemProfiles"/&gt; Catherine is voiced by [[Miyuki Sawashiro]] in Japanese,&lt;ref name="FamStaffComments"/&gt; and [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]] in English.&lt;ref name="SilLocalVoiceDirector"/&gt;
* {{nihongo|'''Katherine McBride'''|キャサリン・マクブライド|Kyasarin Makuburaido}}, a 32-year-old woman who is an old school friend of Vincent's working as an office manager at a clothing manufacturer. Having known each other since high school, Katherine and Vincent meet up again five years prior to the game's events and begin dating. Katherine is trying to push Vincent into marriage, and gets increasingly irritated by his indecisiveness.&lt;ref name="CathGemProfiles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CathKath"/&gt; Katherine is voiced by [[Kotono Mitsuishi]] in Japanese,&lt;ref name="CathKath"/&gt; and [[Michelle Ruff]] in English.&lt;ref name="SilLocalVoiceDirector"/&gt;

===Plot===
Vincent Brooks is unwilling to commit to marrying longtime girlfriend Katherine. One night at the Stray Sheep Bar, a drunken Vincent meets an enigmatic young woman named Catherine; they have a [[one-night stand]] which turns into an affair. Simultaneously, Vincent begins experiencing surreal nightmares where he and other men must ascend a tower while outrunning terrifying demons; if they fail in the dream, they die in real life.&lt;ref name="CathRef"/&gt; The stress of his [[double life]] and the growing intensity of his nightmares eventually leads Vincent to end the affair with Catherine. In a violent confrontation between Vincent, Catherine, and Katherine, Catherine is seemingly killed; however, the incident is revealed to have occurred in the nightmare, from which Vincent and Katherine escape. The next day, Katherine — who has retained no memory of the nightmare — breaks off their relationship.

Vincent realizes he is seemingly the only person aware of Catherine's existence, and that all of her messages have vanished from his phone. Vincent confronts Mutton, the proprietor of the Stray Sheep who is the only other person he has witnessed Catherine speaking to. He learns that Mutton is [[Dumuzid the Shepherd]], and that Catherine is a [[succubus]] who aided Mutton in his game to kill men who would not commit to marriage and family. Vincent enters the nightmare game one last time, on the condition that he and other men will be freed if he succeeds. Vincent is victorious and defeats Dumuzid, who is revealed to be an associate of [[Astaroth]].&lt;ref name="CathRef"/&gt; From here, there are several possible endings, depending on the player’s actions throughout the game:

*'''Katherine Ending:''' Vincent meets with Katherine, and asks her to take him back. In the “bad” ending, she refuses. In the “good” ending, she forgives him after Mutton and Vincent’s friends reveal his ordeal. In the “true” ending, they are married.
*'''Catherine Ending:''' Vincent summons Catherine, and asks her to be his wife. In the “bad” ending, she refuses. In the “good” ending, Catherine accepts; they live together in [[Hell]] despite the objections of [[Nergal]], the King of Hell and Catherine’s father. In the “true” ending, Vincent overthrows Nergal, becoming the King of Hell with Catherine as his queen.
*'''Freedom Ending:''' Vincent realizes he does not desire marriage. Having won against Mutton, he demands payment from him, which he immediately uses to bet on a wrestling match. In the “good” ending, he loses the bet. In the “true” ending, he wins and uses the money to fulfill his dream of [[Space tourism|visiting outer space]].

In all of the game’s endings, Trisha states in a closing narration that the purpose of Vincent's story, and the player's actions in directing his story, was to determine whether the player desired a life of comfort or a life of excitement. She explains that tower was a [[Hero's journey|metaphor for the journey to adulthood]], and that "there is no right way to climb the tower."&lt;ref name="CathBook"/&gt; In a secret ending unlocked when the player clears the game’s challenge stages, Trisha [[Breaking the fourth wall|speaks directly to the player]] and reveals that she is [[Ishtar]], with Astaroth having been one of her avatars. Having grown tired of Dumuzid’s infidelity, the events of ''Catherine'' were a test to find someone worthy of her love. She offers to make the player into a deity so that they can become her consort.&lt;ref name="CathBook"/&gt;

==Development==
''Catherine'' was developed by the "2nd Creative Production Department", a team within [[Atlus]] who had previously handled development for the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, a subseries within the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise.&lt;ref name="CatherineDev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="4Gcatherine"/&gt; Planning for ''Catherine'' began while the development team were performing final polishing work for ''[[Persona 4]]'' prior to the latter's 2008 release.&lt;ref name="4Gcatherine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FamCathOrigins"/&gt; ''Catherine'' was the very first title developed by Atlus for [[High-definition video|high-definition]] (HD) [[video game console]]s, specifically the [[PlayStation 3]] (PS3) and [[Xbox 360]] (360).&lt;ref name="FamStaffComments"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FamCathOrigins"/&gt; It used the third-party [[Gamebryo]] [[game engine]].&lt;ref name="CathBryon"/&gt; While they had the option of developing the title for [[Handheld game console|handheld consoles]] or [[mobile device]]s, Hashino felt that the game would lose its charm on less powerful hardware. Using HD consoles they were able to fully portray the world of ''Catherine''. Despite the shift onto HD consoles making their vision easier to realize, debugging for multiple consoles caused problems that pushed back the planned development schedule.&lt;ref name="FamCathOrigins"/&gt; In a 2012 statement, an Atlus staff member said that ''Catherine'' was a "difficult" game for the company to make.&lt;ref name="CathNaoki"/&gt; The game would later be called a "test" for the development of the [[Persona 5|next ''Persona'' title]].&lt;ref name="4Gcatherine"/&gt;

The aim with ''Catherine'' was to create a game that was not within the role-playing genre as with the majority of Atlus' titles, in addition to making something that was aimed at adults. The main aim was to create something new as a change prior to developing a new role-playing game.&lt;ref name="FamStaffComments"/&gt; The three key staff members were all veterans of the ''Persona'' series: director and producer Katsura Hashino had helmed both ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''Persona 4''; art director and character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]] had designed characters for both ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4''; and composer [[Shoji Meguro]] had created music for multiple ''Megami Tensei'' titles, including the ''Persona'' series. The chief designer was Kazuhisa Wada, while the chief programmer was Yujiro Kosaka.&lt;ref name="FamStaffComments"/&gt;&lt;ref name="4Gcatherine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CathStaffANN"/&gt; The initial story was written by Hashino, who originally worked alone on the scenario before other writers were brought on to help.&lt;ref name="CathInfoDeng"/&gt; Hashino felt that ''Catherine'' was an ambitious title due to its themes and subject matter, saying that no-one but Atlus would have supported the project. The main theme is love between men and women, although in its infancy the project was themed around conflict. In order to make the love triangle between Vincent, Catherine and Katherine sound realistic, he asked other members of Atlus staff for their experiences. One story, where a woman detailed killing people in her dreams, was almost directly referenced within the game.&lt;ref name="CathInfoDeng"/&gt;

Soejima, who had mainly worked on the ''Persona'' series up to this point, was most focused on making the characters' expressions seem realistic within the context of the story.&lt;ref name="FamStaffComments"/&gt; All the characters were designed around being realistic, with their proportions being more akin to real people rather than stylized figures.&lt;ref name="CathSoejima1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P5magazine"/&gt; According to him, he was influenced by the game's themes of instinctual desire intruding into everyday life, the desire for sleep, and the concept of greed. Vincent exemplified these themes.&lt;ref name="CathSoejima2"/&gt; Vincent's character was based on and named after [[Vincent Gallo]], specifically his appearance in the 1998 film ''[[Buffalo '66]]''. The younger "Catherine" was designed to be beautiful and youthful when compared to "Katherine", who had an adult charm.&lt;ref name="CathInfoDeng"/&gt; The pink coloring of the game's [[user interface]] was intended to evoke its sensual and "kitschy" atmosphere.&lt;ref name="CathUI"/&gt; The cutscenes were created by anime production studio [[Studio 4°C]].&lt;ref name="CathStaffANN"/&gt; While the ''Persona'' games up to that point boasted around half an hour of cutscenes, the number in ''Catherine'' came to considerably more. Studio 4&amp;nbsp;°C spent around a year working on the anime cutscenes.&lt;ref name="CathInfoDeng"/&gt;

Meguro began working on the first demo tracks for the game in August 2009. Meguro worked as the main composer, leading a team composed of himself, Kenichi Tsuchiya, Atsushi Kitajoh, and Toshiki Konishi. Kitajoh was the general coordinator and managed sound effects for the action scenes.&lt;ref name="MeguroCathLiners"/&gt; Meguro did not have much freedom with the project, as Hashino was specific about that he wanted the music to be like. The key words he was given were "classic", "adult oriented" and "erotic".&lt;ref name="FamStaffComments"/&gt; Meguro and his team used multiple genres for the music in ''Catherine'', switching genre depending on the flow of gameplay; action segments used remixes of Classical music, quiet moments used jazz, and the anime cutscenes used strings.&lt;ref name="CathShoji2"/&gt; Meguro found creating music for the anime cutscenes difficult when compared to earlier projects within the company, as he had to match his music's beat to work by an external company. To help cope Meguro received aid from Tsuchiya, a long-time collaborator on previous cutscene-based pieces.&lt;ref name="CathShoji1"/&gt; Meguro was highly impressed by both the sound quality compared to his previous work with the company, and the amount of control were was adjusting the relative volume of music and sound effects.&lt;ref name="FamStaffComments"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CathShoji1"/&gt;

==Release==
[[File:Catherine XBox 360 Japan.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Uncensored Xbox 360 cover art featuring Katherine. The differing covers of the 360 and PS3 versions were intended to catch consumer eyes in stores, and exemplify the contrasting appeal of the two heroines.&lt;ref name="CathPackagingJP"/&gt;]]
''Catherine'' was first announced in August 2010, along with its prospective platforms.&lt;ref name="CathAnnounced"/&gt; Upon its announcement, ''Catherine'' proved unexpectedly popular, garnering as much public attention and fan expectation as recent releases in the ''Persona'' series.&lt;ref name="CathInfoDeng"/&gt; Due to the game's content, Atlus found it difficult to gain their wished-for rating from Japan's [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]] ratings board.&lt;ref name="FamCathOrigins"/&gt; Beginning from October 2010, Atlus and its then-parent Index Media began a "aggressive" advertising campaign to promote the title in Japan.&lt;ref name="SilHashino"/&gt; ''Catherine'' released on February 17, 2011.&lt;ref name="CathDateJP"/&gt; A PS3 demo for the game was released in January, but in early February Atlus pulled the demo, stating that it had achieved the maximum number of planned downloads.&lt;ref name="CathJPDemo"/&gt; Following player complaints about the game's difficulty, Atlus created a patch which added a lower difficulty. The patches for both the PS3 and 360 versions released in March.&lt;ref name="CathJPpatchPS3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CathJPpatch360"/&gt; The PS3 version was released in mainland Asia on July 26, 2011, distributed by Softsource. The 360 version was not released in the region due to unspecified coding issues.&lt;ref name="CathAsiaRelease"/&gt;

Different cover artwork was created by Soejima for the 360 and PS3 versions—the PS3 cover showed Catherine showing off her cleavage, while the 360 cover had Katherine lying on her front showing her behind. Soejima was originally told by Hashino to create covers that would catch people's eyes in stores; the different cover arts for different versions was chosen as they felt it would be interesting. The two characters were originally going to be in identical, near-naked poses. This was changed due to the character's different charms, which it was felt would be lost if they were posed in such a way. Soejima went through multiple cover designs, with one being the two characters holding different cutlery utensils. Hashino had little involvement beyond his initial instruction, but did ask that more of Katherine's back be shown in the image. The covers exemplified each character's contrasting appeal: Catherine's cleavage showed off her youthful beauty, while displaying Katherine's behind was meant to evoke her more motherly charms.&lt;ref name="CathPackagingJP"/&gt; This artwork was used for retail posters, but Atlus also created alternate artwork for stores that wanted something less risque.&lt;ref name="CathJPPoster"/&gt;

''Catherine'' was initially not planned for a Western release.&lt;ref name="CathJPexclusive"/&gt; After an initial leak through listings on [[EB Games]] and [[Gamestop]], Atlus USA confirmed that ''Catherine'' would be released in North America.&lt;ref name="SilCathUSannounced"/&gt; Atlus USA initially had difficulty persuading mainstream stores like [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Walmart]] to take ''Catherine'' due to its suggestive cover art and marketing calling it an "adult" title, which was mostly associated with erotic games not sold in such stores. To convince them that the game was suitable for mainstream stores, Atlus USA put together a film reel of clips from unspecified [[AAA (video game industry)|triple-A]] games those stores did sell that featured more explicit content than ''Catherine''. When they met the retailer representatives, they showcased the film and pointed out that ''Catherine'' had none of that content, before showing off the most explicit scenes in the game to prove their point. The retailers were convinced and allowed ''Catherine'' to be sold in mainstream stores, and were also convinced into looking through their stocks as concerns were raised due to the film showcasing other games' erotic content.&lt;ref name="CathWestStores"/&gt; As with the Japanese version, Atlus used alternate covers for the 360 and PS3 versions. In addition, they created alternate versions of those covers that toned down the suggestive elements for stores catering to more sensitive consumers.&lt;ref name="SilCathCoversWest"/&gt; ''Catherine'' released in North America on July 26, 2011.&lt;ref name="CathUSDate"/&gt; In addition to the standard edition, a special limited "Love is Dead" edition was created for both PS3 and 360.&lt;ref name="CathNAcollectors"/&gt;

Though initial statements from Atlus said that ''Catherine'' would not be released in Europe,&lt;ref name="CathEUdetails"/&gt; its release in the region was leaked through a rating for the 360 version in Germany.&lt;ref name="CathEUleak"/&gt; Its official release was confirmed in a press release from Atlus shortly after the leak. The title was published by [[Deep Silver]] across all PAL territories, and featured written language support for English, Spanish, German, French, and Italian. Deep Silver was chosen as the publisher as they shared Atlus' enthusiasm about the game.&lt;ref name="CathEUannounced"/&gt; ''Catherine'' released in Europe on February 10, 2012.&lt;ref name="CathEUdate"/&gt; As with North America, the PS3 and 360 versions had a limited special edition. Called the "Stray Sheep Edition" after a central location in the game, it had differing content to the North American edition.&lt;ref name="CathEUcollectors"/&gt; In Australia, the title was distributed by QV Software.&lt;ref name="CathAUqv"/&gt; The PS3 version released on February 16,&lt;ref name="QVcathPS3"/&gt; while the 360 version released on February 23.&lt;ref name="QVcath360"/&gt;

The game was localized for the West by [[Atlus USA]], who had previously handled many of the company's earlier titles.&lt;ref name="SilLocalVoiceDirector"/&gt; Main localization staff included editors Mike Meeker and Clayton S. Chan; and [[quality assurance]] staff Scott Williams, Jonathon Reinhold, Kourtnie McKenzie, Allie Doyon and Charles Chaikaew.&lt;ref name="KotoCathLocalInterview"/&gt; Compared to previous Atlus titles, which had focused on Japanese culture, Atlus USA had comparatively little work adjusting things for a Western audience as the game was set within a North American city environment. Their main issue was with the dialogue, which was meant to be naturalistic despite some tongue in cheek dialogue, alongside jokes and references that needed adjusting so they would make sense to a Western audience. According to the localizers, the problem "[wasn't] translating the definition, it's translating the intent".&lt;ref name="PSBlogCath"/&gt; A major issue the team faced was with the quotes used in loading screens. While they were apparently all famous quotes, they had been taken from a Japanese book of quotes without any authors being mentioned, in addition to their translation into Japanese sometimes being poor. In the event, Atlus USA went with new quotes to put in their place rather than trying to identify and translate the existing quotes. The quotes used were from multiple sources, including [[Douglas Adams]], [[George Carlin]] and [[Rodney Dangerfield]]. According to Chan, the main advantage of ''Catherine'' compared to other projects was that the situations and characters were ones he and other team members could understand rather than typical fantasy scenarios.&lt;ref name="KotoCathLocalInterview"/&gt;

Valerie Arem of PCB Productions was the voice director for dubbing.&lt;ref name="SilLocalVoiceDirector"/&gt; Rather than recording as a team, each actor recorded their lines separately.&lt;ref name="CathRuffInterview"/&gt; Baker, Bailey and Willingham, the respective voices of Vincent, Catherine and Johnny, described the voice recording period as a positive experience, reinforced by the fact that they were all old friends. Baker noted that it was a relative rarity for this to be the case in general voice acting.&lt;ref name="CathBakerInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CathBaileyInterview"/&gt; Ruff, the voice of Katherine, was helped in her performance by both Arem and Atlus staff.&lt;ref name="CathRuffInterview"/&gt; In contrast to the majority of Japanese game localizations, the lip movements for some cutscenes were adjusted so they would sync with the English voices. This was done to give the acting and performances a more natural feel. This meant that the voice actors had more freedom to adlib parts of their performance: a cited example was the fight between Katherine and Catherine, where the two actresses adlibed the majority of the characters' argument. The aim for realism also meant that the performances were more restrained than those given for Japanese anime, which leaned towards stylized performances.&lt;ref name="SilLocalVoiceDirector"/&gt; For real-time cutscenes, lines had to be matched with gestures and line lengths to within 0.2 seconds; the Atlus staff needed to go through the Japanese script and create a dedicated column for speaking times, then they acted out the lines themselves so they had a reference for the voice actors, and finally they would allow an actor to alter things a little to suit their performance and document those changes so the subtitles matched.&lt;ref name="KotoCathLocalInterview"/&gt;

Baker, Bailey and Ruff had all previously worked with Atlus on the ''Persona'' series: Ruff voiced Yukari Takeba in ''Persona 3'' while Baker and Bailey respectively voiced [[Kanji Tatsumi]] and Rise Kujikawa from ''Persona 4''.&lt;ref name="CathBakerInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CathRuffInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BaileyRise"/&gt; In an interview, Baker described the Atlus USA staff as giving him and the other English actors a great deal of freedom when it came to delivering lines and portraying their characters. He noted that the themes in ''Catherine'' were far more controversial compared to earlier titles he and Atlus had worked on, and that it was a unique voice acting opportunity.&lt;ref name="CathBakerInterview"/&gt; Bailey was working on another Atlus project when she was offered the opportunity to voice Catherine. Having already heard of the project in the press, Bailey accepted the offer; during her time recording lines, she found the experience strange as she considered Baker to be a brotherly figure, starkly contrasting the relationship between Vincent and Catherine.&lt;ref name="CathBaileyInterview"/&gt; Ruff was offered the role of Katherine based on her acting abilities and her previous work with Atlus. She saw some footage of Katherine to get a feeling for her relationship with Vincent, but did not try to sync her performance with the Japanese. This was partly because of the planned English sync adjustments, and partly because she heard Japanese voice recording and cutscene finalization was still in progress.&lt;ref name="CathRuffInterview"/&gt; This was confirmed by Arem in a separate interview. Arem described each main actor's strengths during recording: Baker had good timing when it came to delivering his lines, Bailey required few retakes, while Ruff was able to realistically convey a variety of emotions. She also noted the work done by Fitzgerald, the voice actress for both Trisha and Erica; Fitzgerald had difficulty with the timing for Trisha's lines, but managed to "pull it off".&lt;ref name="SilLocalVoiceDirector"/&gt; The amount of voice acting involved was so large that the actors felt they could not finish it.&lt;ref name="CathBakerInterview"/&gt; Looking back on the production, Arem said she would not recast any of the characters.&lt;ref name="SilLocalVoiceDirector"/&gt;

==Professional competition==

''Catherine'' received mostly positive reviews from critics.

==Legacy==
Since its release, ''Catherine'' has appeared on several lists of the top games of the [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation era of video game consoles]]. In August 2012, IGN placed the game at number eighteen on its list of "The Top 25 PlayStation 3 Games", with editor Colin Moriarty praising it as "authentically unique" after calling it an example of something "that's so radically unlike anything else that came before it that it's hard to ignore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Greg |last1=Miller |first2=Colin |last2=Moriarty |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/20/the-top-25-playstation-3-games-2?page=2 |title=The Top 25 PlayStation 3 Games |page=2 |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=August 20, 2012 |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825025613/http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/20/the-top-25-playstation-3-games-2?page=2 |archivedate=August 25, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year in September 2013, ''Catherine'' ranked twenty-fourth on IGN's updated "Top 25 PlayStation 3 Games" list, with Moriarty stating that "the puzzles are both challenging and fun, but what makes ''Catherine'' truly stand apart is its daring subject matter and its unapologetic nudging to make us confront some incredibly uncomfortable – but tempting – situations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Colin |last1=Moriarty |first2=Andrew |last2=Goldfarb |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/03/igns-top-25-playstation-3-games |title=IGN's Top 25 PlayStation 3 Games |page=1 |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=September 3, 2013 |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414083554/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/03/igns-top-25-playstation-3-games |archivedate=April 14, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'' ranked the game seventy-ninth on its "Top 100 Games of the Generation" list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=HG Staff |url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2013/11/05/games-of-the-generation-80-61/60853/ |title=Top 100 Games of the Generation 80-61 |work=[[Hardcore Gamer]] |date=November 5, 2013 |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714123705/http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2013/11/05/games-of-the-generation-80-61/60853/ |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' placed it at number eight on its list of "The 25 Most Underrated Games Of the Last Console Generation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Haske |url=http://www.complex.com/video-games/2013/11/most-underrated-games-last-gen/cat#gallery |title=08.

''Catherine'' protagonist Vincent made a cameo appearance in ''Persona 3 Portable'', the [[PlayStation Portable]] remake of ''Persona 3''. The port's female protagonist runs into Vincent, who makes reference to the events of ''Catherine''.&lt;ref name="CathPersonaSil"/&gt; Vincent was included in ''Persona 3 Portable'' as it was created by the same development team as ''Catherine'', but the version of Vincent in ''Persona 3 Portable'' is not the same as that used in ''Catherine''.&lt;ref name="CathPersona3"/&gt; Despite the possibility, staff have discounted the possibility of either an anime adaptation or further games in the series, the latter due to the game's challenging production.&lt;ref name="PSBlogCath"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CathNaoki"/&gt; In 2013, Liz Lanier of ''[[Game Informer]]'' included "Catherine / Katherine" among the top ten female villains in video games, stating that "...Vincent can't catch a break between Catherine seducing him one minute and manipulating him the next; Katherine isn't much better with her passive-aggressive push toward marriage.

According to Auerbach, the game is "a bellwether for what tech culture and gaming have come to mean for a lot of men: a safe playspace from the realities that they believe women force on them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Auerbach |first= David |date= July 24, 2014 |title= The Most Sexist Video Game of All Time? |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2014/07/catherine_video_game_the_most_sexist_platformer_of_all_time.html |newspaper= [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |location=  |publisher=  |accessdate= July 25, 2014 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140724170105/http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2014/07/catherine_video_game_the_most_sexist_platformer_of_all_time.html |archivedate= July 24, 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fan edit''' is a version of a film [[Film editing|modified]] by a viewer, that removes, reorders, or adds material in order to create a new interpretation of the source material. This includes the removal of scenes or dialogue, replacement of audio and/or visual elements, and adding material from sources such as deleted scenes or even other films.

Fan edits first came into prominence in 2000, when professional editor [[Mike J. Nichols]] released ''[[The Phantom Edit]]'', an edited version of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]'' that removed elements he found distracting. ''The Phantom Edit'' circulated online and received attention by the media for its attempt to improve upon the original film, which inspired others to attempt similar edits on other films.

In their most common form, fan edits resemble the work done by professional editors when creating a [[director's cut|director's or extended cut]] of a film, although fan edits are usually limited by the footage already made available to the public with the official [[home video]] release of a film, while professional editors working for a film studio have access to more and higher quality footage and elements. In addition to re-editing films, some fan edits feature basic corrections, such as colors or framing, that maintain or restore consistency within the film, such as the ''[[Star Wars]]'' fan-restoration ''[[Harmy's Despecialized Edition]]'', which aims at restoring the [[Star Wars#Original trilogy|''Star Wars'' Original Trilogy]] to its original, pre-[[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|Special Edition]] form. Other types of fan edits, such as ''Cosmogony'', ''Bateman Begins: An American Psycho'' and ''Memories Alone'', merge footage from various films into an entirely different production.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.businessinsider.com/the-15-coolest-fan-edits-of-popular-movies-2014-12?op=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://whatculture.com/film/10-fan-edits-that-totally-transform-famous-films&lt;/ref&gt; While many fan edits are viewed as reactionary to perceived weaknesses in the original films, one film scholar at the [[University of Kansas]] has argued that such edits allow fans to creatively reimagine films instead of merely attempting to fix such works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://college.ku.edu/about/news/fan-editors-are-artists-not-disgruntled-fans-ku-scholar-argues|title=Fan editors are artists, not disgruntled fans, KU scholar argues|date=2014-11-06|work=College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Fan edits are made for non-commercial purposes and as such could be considered a case of [[fair use]], but their legality is unclear.

==History==
Before the term "fan edit" was coined, many alternate versions of films edited by other fans or professional editors were simply known as a "cut." In the late 1970s, many alternate "cuts" of films were released in the United States, and foreign films (such as those from [[Europe]] or [[Japan]]) deemed unsuitable for American audiences underwent further alterations, score changes and re-titlings.

The first fan edit to popularize the field was ''[[The Phantom Edit]]'', created in 2000 by professional editor [[Mike J. Nichols]] under the pseudonym of the "Phantom Editor". Nichols removed elements from [[George Lucas]]' ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]'' that he felt detracted from the film, and made minor changes in dialogue, languages and subtitles to give the film's villains a more menacing tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2001/11/05/phantom_edit/|title="The Phantom Edit"|first=Daniel|last=Kraus|work=salon.com|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end result was distributed on [[VHS]] and later online. ''The Phantom Edit'' was the first of many ''[[Star Wars]]'' fan edits to come, and has since inspired dozens of edits to surface on the internet.

The second major edit was done with ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'', originally a film that [[Stanley Kubrick]] was involved with, that [[Steven Spielberg]] ended up directing after Kubrick's death. In 2002, an independent filmmaker named DJ Hupp introduced his take on the film named "The Kubrick Edit", omitting certain scenes to alter the tone, to be closer to Kubrick's style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jul/25/internet.technology|title=Hollywood: the people's cut|first=Peter|last=Rojas|date=July 24, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=April 18, 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason 2008 87"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mason|first=Matt|title=The Pirate's Dilemma: How Youth Culture is Reinventing Capitalism|year=2008|publisher=Free Press|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the ''Purist Edit'' changed ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' to more closely follow [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s books.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wille.tv/2015/01/20/the-hobbit-the-tolkien-edit-and-screener-based-fan-edits/|title=‘The Hobbit: The Tolkien Edit’ and Screener-based Fan Edits|first=Author|last=JW|date=January 20, 2015|work=wille.tv|accessdate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Matthew Wilhelm Kapell |editor2=John Shelton Lawrence |title=Finding the Force of the Star Wars Franchise: Fans, Merchandise, and Critics |publisher=[[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang]] |page=259 |date=July 1, 2006 |isbn=0820488089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After that the trend started to gain popularity and spread to other films in the same fashion, such as [[The Matrix (franchise)|''The Matrix'' series]], ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'', ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'', ''[[Superman II]]'', and others. Editor Adywan (Adrian Sayce) made a complete overhaul of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' in 2009 and 2017 respectively, under the title ''Star Wars - Revisited'', featuring continuity fixes, image and cropping corrections, score restoration, new matter, rotoscoping work and new CGI elements to remove several additions from the various Special Editions of the films from 1997 onward. In 2008, a similar overhaul was made by editor Uncanny Antman (Sean O'Sullivan) to ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'', which changed the film's tone to be more in line with the first two films and fixed various continuity contradictions to the previous films and image &amp; cropping errors; the film was rereleased under the title of ''Terminator: The Coming Storm''.

Professional filmmaker [[Steven Soderbergh]] has created fan edits of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and its [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]], ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' and ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' that he has posted on his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/steven-soderbergh-posts-his-110-minute-recut-2001--213842|title=Steven Soderbergh posts his 110-minute recut of 2001: A Space Odyssey|date=January 14, 2015|work=avclub.com|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/28/5661664/steven-soderbergh-tries-to-fix-the-worst-film-of-all-time-with-his|title=Steven Soderbergh tries to fix 'the worst film of all time' with his own fan edit|date=April 28, 2014|work=theverge.com|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent filmmaker Peet Gelderblom made a fan edit of Brian De Palma's ''[[Raising Cain]]'', which attempted to reorder the film the way it was originally scripted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2012/01/feature-film-with-video-essay-brian-de-palmas-raising-cain-is-re-cut-132482/|title=FEATURE FILM WITH VIDEO ESSAY: Brian De Palma’s RAISING CAIN is re-cut - IndieWire|first=Peet|last=Gelderblom|work=indiewire.com|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Palma came across the fan edit and was so impressed with it, he had Gelderblom supervise a [[High-definition video|high definition]] version of it for [[Blu-ray]], which was released under the [[Director's Cut]] label, as De Palma felt that the edit has "restored the true story of ''Raising Cain''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directorama.net/2016/07/26/changing-cain-fan-edit-brian-de-palma-directors-cut/|title=Changing Cain: How my fan-edit became a Brian De Palma Director’s Cut – DIRECTORAMA - Peet Gelderblom|work=directorama.net|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CleanFlicks]] was a Utah-based video store that offered more than 700 movies that had been remixed to appeal to Utah's religious family audience. The chain of stores spread across 18 states in 70 different locations before a federal court judge ruled their remixes illegal in 2006.&lt;ref name="Mason 2008 87"/&gt;

==Fair use issues==
While fan edits skirt the lines of [[fair use]], the fan editing community largely emphasizes the use of the final product should only be for those who own the source material (commercial home video releases such as [[DVD-Video|DVD]]), and are not to be distributed for profit or other personal gain.&lt;ref name="fanedit.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fanedit.org/rules/|title=Rules – Fanedit.org|work=fanedit.org|accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucasfilm]] is aware of the existence of ''Star Wars'' fan edits, and has stated they will take action when they believe [[copyright]] infringement has taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue219/news.html |title=Science Fiction News of the Week |date=March 25, 2009 |accessdate=April 17, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325082542/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue219/news.html |archivedate=March 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, Lucasfilm took action against fan editor "daveytod" after taking issue with his fan edit documentary of ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'', named ''The Clones Revealed''. Their email to him cited the possibility of "consumer confusion," that ''The Clones Revealed'' might be mistaken for an official Lucasfilm product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://originaltrilogy.com/topic/The-Clones-Revealed-Available-Now/id/4278/page/9|title="The Clones Revealed" - Available Now! - Original Trilogy|work=originaltrilogy.com|accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The email was sent to several active members of the fan editing community and resulted in the short down time of Fanedit.org. The reasoning given by Lucasfilm's anti-piracy team during communications with Fanedit.org moderators seemed to display the mistaken impression that ''The Clones Revealed'' was a [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forums.fanedit.org/thread-634-post-54621.html#pid54621|title=Fanedit Forums|work=fanedit.org|accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, Fanedit.org was briefly closed after receiving a complaint from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] regarding the use of links to its copyrights appearing on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-castrates-worlds-biggest-fanedit-movie-site-081123/|title=MPAA 'Castrates' World's Biggest FanEdit Movie Site - TorrentFreak|date=November 23, 2008|work=torrentfreak.com|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a three-day downtime, the website reopened without any links to potentially infringing files.

Fanedit.org has a policy to not allow fan edits made from pirated versions of films to be listed in its database.&lt;ref name="fanedit.org"/&gt; One notable victim of this policy is ''The Purist Edit'' of ''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'', made from a [[DVD screener]] leak of the film's theatrical version. Despite being one of the earliest major fan edits available and having historical importance, it is not listed on Fanedit.org.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''FilmFlex''', is an [[Video on demand|on-demand]] movie rental services provider, claiming to be largest outside the US.&lt;ref name="HMV" /&gt; It is a joint venture between [[Sony Pictures Television]] and [[The Walt Disney Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/11/11/eu_okays_movieco/|title=Sony, Disney VoD JV wins EC approval|work=The Register|date=11 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Virgin Movies ==
Virgin Movies makes up part of [[Virgin Media]]'s "On Demand" [[video on demand]] system. Virgin Movies has been available on Virgin since January 2005 and saw over 11 million films watched on demand in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.telewest.co.uk/phoenix.zhtml?c=76808&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;t=Regular&amp;id=663415&amp;|title=Telewest Broadband launches first wave of TV-on-demand services with FilmFlex|publisher=Telewest|date=18 January 2005|access-date=1 November 2010|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714003925/http://ir.telewest.co.uk/phoenix.zhtml?c=76808&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;t=Regular&amp;id=663415&amp;|archive-date=14 July 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VMOM" /&gt; FilmFlex replaced ''Front Row'' which was a near video on demand pay-per-view service which was initially available on [[analogue television|analogue]] cable from 1997, switching to [[digital television|digital]] when digital cable services launched from late 1999 onwards. On 13 September 2012, the FilmFlex service was rebranded as Virgin Movies on the cable platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediacentre.virginmedia.com/Stories/New-look-on-demand-movies-unveiled-by-Virgin-Media-23f4.aspx|title=New look on demand movies unveiled by Virgin Media|date=13 September 2012|access-date=13 September 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130205175640/http://mediacentre.virginmedia.com/Stories/New-look-on-demand-movies-unveiled-by-Virgin-Media-23f4.aspx|archive-date=5 February 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virgin Movies provides over 500 movies some of which are available in HD (high definition), which are available at any time for the viewer to watch when they want to. Viewers can search for a movie by title, genre, cast or director. Once a movie has been ordered it can be viewed any time within the next 24 hours before it has to be paid for again. The movie can also be viewed as many times as the viewer likes within the 24 hours for no additional cost. Once viewers are watching a movie they have full control over it by the use of pause, rewind and fast forward functions, much like a DVD.

All genres of movies are available ranging from Hollywood blockbusters to action, adventure, horror, comedy, romance and classic movies.

On 8 February 2013, the two companies signed a multi-year deal, with investment in the development of next-gen functionality on Virgin Movies, including "multi-device playback" through Virgin TV Anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a457098/virgin-movies-to-get-multi-device-playback.html|title=Virgin Movies to get multi-device playback|work=Digital Spy|date=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5098">'''Gambling in Turkey''' is highly regulated. Turkey banned [[casino]]s in 1998, and it banned non-state [[online gambling]] in 2006. A state lottery ([[Milli Piyango]]) and betting services exists, however, and has some online gambling, and illegal gambling continues to persist.

==History==

==Online gambling==

Online gambling in Turkey is currently prohibited, with the exception of the state-owned sports betting company, IDDAA, which is the only Turkish entity that is allowed to offer internet gambling services. The law that prohibits online gambling in Turkey was passed in 2007 and recently, Turkey has also been taking measures to prevent players from using foreign internet gambling websites as well.  Despite the ban on gambling, many Turkish players continue to bet on online gambling sites and are recognized as leading gamblers. In 2013 Turkish government issued the law by which Turkey has become the first country in the world to target individual players instead of gambling operators. Sanctions for anyone caught in Turkey to access online gambling services is a penalty of between £ 100 and £ 500 (about $ 55-278). Casino operators dealing with the Turkish market and bankers serving them can also face the prison conditions at the same time.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

'''''Hannibal Rising''''' is a [[novel]]  by American author [[Thomas Harris]], published in 2006. It is a [[prequel]] to his three previous books featuring his most famous character, the [[cannibal]]istic [[serial killer]] [[Hannibal Lecter|Dr. Hannibal Lecter]].  It is Harris' fifth and most recent novel. The novel was released with an initial printing of at least 1.5 million copies&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/books/09/19/books.hanniballecter.ap/index.html |title=New Hannibal Lecter novel due in December |accessdate=2006-09-19 |author=AP |date=2006-09-19 |work=[[CNN]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920233820/http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/books/09/19/books.hanniballecter.ap/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=2006-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and met with a mixed critical response. [[Audiobook]] versions have also been released, with Harris reading the text. The novel was adapted (by Harris himself) into a [[Hannibal Rising (film)|film of the same name]] in 2007, directed by [[Peter Webber]].

== Plot==
Opening in [[Lithuania]] during 1941, Hannibal Lecter is eight years old and living in a castle with his parents and sister, Mischa. With the castle located near the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|eastern front]] of [[World War II]], the Lecter family escapes to their lodge to elude the advancing [[Nazi Germany|German]] troops. With the castle abandoned, it is soon raided by Germans and [[Hiwi (volunteer)|civilians aiding them]], their hidden art collection among the stolen loot. Three years later, an advancing [[Soviet Army|Soviet]] tank stops at the Lecter family's lodge looking for water, only to be bombed by a German [[Junkers Ju 87|Stuka]], the explosion killing all but the children. Surviving in the lodge, Hannibal and Mischa are captured when five deserters appear: Grutas, Milko, Grentz, Dortlich, and Kolnas. Storming and looting the lodge, they lock the Lecters in the barn. Running low on supplies, the soldiers soon take Mischa; realizing they intend to [[cannibalism|cannibalize]] her, Hannibal tries to stop them, only to have his arm broken before he blacks out.

Hannibal is later spotted by a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] tank crew, wearing shackles and rendered [[muteness|mute]]. Returned to Lecter Castle, now a Soviet orphanage, Hannibal is found to be irreparably [[psychological trauma|traumatized]] by the ordeal. Removed from the orphanage by his uncle Robert Lecter, Hannibal goes to live with him in [[France]] with his aunt, Lady Murasaki. Visiting a marketplace with his aunt, Lecter assaults butcher Paul Momund when he insults Murasaki. Count Lecter, learning of the slight against his wife, violently confronts the butcher and collapses and subsequently dies from a heart attack. Losing most of the Count's estate to [[death duties]], Lecter and Murasaki move across France, and Lecter flourishes as a medical student, assisting by preparing cadavers for lessons.

Locating Momund the butcher, Lecter murders him for his actions, eviscerating and beheading him before eating his cheeks. Suspected by Inspector Popil, Lecter escapes suspicion when Murasaki falsifies evidence, suggesting Momund's death was political. Using [[sodium thiopental]] to recall the lodge, Lecter remembers Mischa's murder and her killer's faces, and that the lodge was shelled; the building burning and soldiers fleeing, Lecter was freed by Kolnas, who was then crushed by falling debris. Working with Popil to recover his family's stolen art, Lecter attends a recovered art exhibition with Murasaki, and speaks with one of Grutas' men selling the art. Afraid he will uncover their identities, Grutas sends Dortlich to murder him.

Returning to the dilapidated lodge, Lecter searches the ruins and finds a bag of buried loot, which also contains the hidden dogtags of his captors. Attacked by Dortlich, Lecter strikes him with his shovel, and ties him to a tree stump. Noosed to a horse, Dortlich confirms Grentz relocated to Canada, and that Kolnas owns a restaurant in [[Fontainebleau]]; despite his pleas, Lecter uses the horse to tear off Dortlich's head. Returning to France, Lecter is kissed by Murasaki, who insists that he promise to stop killing and to co-operate with Popil; Lecter responds that he already promised revenge for Mischa, and leaves. Lecter continues his studies only to be stalked during his night-shift by Milko. Outwitting Milko and drugging him, Lecter interrogates him for information on Grutas, before drowning him in an embalming tank and incinerating his remains.

Eating at Kolnas' restaurant, Lecter notices his daughter is wearing Mischa's stolen bracelet. Entering Grutas' property, Hannibal sets an improvised bomb and confronts him as he bathes, only to be interrupted by Grutas' guards. As Lecter is about to be killed, his bomb detonates and cuts the power, allowing him to wound the guards and escape in the chaos. Returning to Murasaki's home, Lecter receives a call from Grutas, who threatens to kill her unless he surrenders; overhearing [[Ortolan bunting|ortolans]] singing in the background of the phone call, Lecter breaks into Kolnas' home, and then heads to his restaurant. Lecter shows he took Mischa's bracelet from his daughter and, in exchange for information, offers to spare Kolnas and free his family. Giving up the location of Grutas' houseboat, Kolnas then realizes Lecter was lying about holding his family. Attacked by Kolnas, Lecter fatally stabs him through the head with a [[tantō]].

Finding and reaching the boat, Lecter sneaks aboard but is wounded by the captain. Killing the guards and captain, Lecter rushes to save Murasaki, only to be shot in the back by Grutas, who boasts while molesting a bound Murasaki. Lecter removes his tantō, dimpled by Grutas' bullet, and uses it to cut Grutas' hamstring. With Grutas disarmed, Murasaki begs Lecter spare him for Popil, only for Grutas to mock him. Taunting that Lecter drank broth made from Mischa, he suggests Lecter kills only to continue lying to himself; enraged, Lecter carves several "M"s into Grutas, fatally wounding him. Horrified by Lecter, Murasaki declares there's nothing human left inside him to love, and dives overboard. Detonating the houseboat with an improvised explosive, Lecter flees the scene.

Arrested by Popil, Lecter is soon freed when popular support for his dispatch of [[war crimes|war criminals]] combines with a lack of hard evidence. Lecter meets with Murasaki, and they say their goodbyes and part. Offered a residency at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], Lecter heads overseas to North America, stopping briefly to visit bar-owner Grentz in [[Quebec]], Canada.

== Development ==
The February 22, 2007 issue of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' features a quote that suggests that the only reason Thomas Harris wrote the story was out of the fear that a Lecter prequel/origin story would inevitably be written without his involvement. ''Hannibal Rising'' film producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] said "I say to Thomas, 'If you don't do [the prequel], I will do it with someone else... I don't want to lose this [[media franchise|franchise]]. And the audience wants it...' He said, 'No. I'm sorry.' And I said, 'I ''will'' do it with somebody else.' And then he said, 'Let me think about it. I will come up with an idea.'"&lt;ref name="Entertainment Weekly"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20012076,00.html |title=Lecter Loses His Bite |accessdate=2014-08-09 |author=Fierman, Daniel |date=2007-02-16 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''I Am...''' (sometimes referred to as the '''I Am... Tour''' or the '''I Am... World Tour''') was the fourth [[concert tour]] by American recording artist [[Beyoncé]] launched in support of her third studio album, ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008). The tour was announced in October 2008 embarked in March 2009 with five rehearsal shows in North America. The tour consisted of 108 shows in total, visiting the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. Preparations for the shows began eight months prior to the beginning of the tour with twelve-hour rehearsals for two months. Knowles described the shows as her best and most theatrical from all of her tours. 

The [[set list]] for the concerts included songs from Knowles' three studio albums as well as several covers of other artists and a [[Destiny's Child]] medley. The central theme of the tour was to showcase the difference between Knowles' dual personality; her emotional side and her onstage persona, Sasha Fierce which was also demonstrated in the dual album ''I Am... Sasha Fierce''. The show featured two stages – the main one and a smaller [[B-stage]] where Knowles was transferred during the middle of the show. She was backed by an all-female band, female background dancers and a big [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] screen. [[Thierry Mugler]] collaborated with Knowles on the costumes and had a creative advisor role further working on the [[choreography]], [[lighting]] and production. [[Chris March]] made the costumes usable for stage and helped in their making. For the ballads, Knowles wore longer dresses while for the performances of the up-tempo songs, more make-up and more revealing outfits were worn. The fashion and Knowles' look and figure received praise from critics.

I Am... received critical acclaim from [[music journalism|music critics]] who praised Knowles' performance abilities calling her the best female performer. A concert in Malaysia was cancelled by Knowles after several Muslim groups tried to ban it although she agreed to tone down her look according to the country's standards. The tour was commercially successful grossing $86.0 million from 93 shows in total. Separate performances of several songs were broadcast on different channels and two concerts were released as [[live album]]s; the live performance at the [[I Am... Yours]] revue was [[I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas|released]] in a [[CD]]/[[DVD]] format in 2009 and footage of the tour was released on the [[I Am... World Tour (album)|similarly titled live album]] in 2010.

In 2006, during an interview with [[MTV News]], Beyoncé introduced an aggressive alter ego, Sasha Fierce, which also served as her stage persona. She added that the persona is a complete opposite of her when not performing by characterizing her as "aggressive... strong... fearless."&lt;ref name="fierceego"&gt;{{cite news |title=Beyonce Explains 'Fearless' Stage Persona In 2006 Interview |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1627106/beyonce-explains-fearless-stage-persona-2006-interview.jhtml |publisher=[[MTV News]].

The performances saw her singing the songs on a [[stairs|staircase]] which was the largest piece of equipment on stage.}}
Beyoncé revealed that the hardest aspect of coming up with the tour's set list was managing to fit her decade-long song catalogue in a two-hour show.&lt;ref name="mama"/&gt; According to her, the tour was supposed to be more emotional than The Beyoncé Experience in order to reflect the "real[,] raw and more sensitive" nature of the ''I Am...'' portion of the double album.&lt;ref name="mama"/&gt; Beyoncé expressed frustration that snippets of the show appeared online after the first shows on the opening leg, thus "ruining" the surprise factor of the concert experience; however she also appreciated the fact that it can act as a "little sneak peek" for fans to decide if they indeed want to attend.&lt;ref name="mama"/&gt; French designer [[Thierry Mugler]] served as the creative advisor while also being responsible for Beyoncé's wardrobe. He contributed in the design of lighting, [[choreography]], production and directed three sequences for the concert.&lt;ref name="claire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/fashion/289751/thierry-mugler-to-design-beyonce-tour.html|title=Thierry Mugler to design Beyoncé tour|date=December 4, 2008|accessdate=December 28, 2009|work=[[Marie Claire]]|first=Lucy|last=Hutchings|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212082019/http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/fashion/289751/thierry-mugler-to-design-beyonce-tour.html|archivedate=December 12, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his creative vision, the shows were intended to represent ''[[mise en scène|mise-en-scène]]'' by incorporating technical aspects with fashion in order to capture the emotions behind the songs. He added, "There will be a lot of dramatization and metamorphosis on stage. Some very strong effects have been inspired directly by Beyoncé, and only she could make [them] happen on stage."&lt;ref name="chron" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wwd.com" /&gt; 

Onstage, Beyoncé was backed by her ten-piece all-female band, Suga Mama, which included two [[drummer]]s, two [[keyboardist]]s, a percussionist, a [[horn section]], three backup vocalists called the Mamas, and a lead [[guitarist]].&lt;ref name="press" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; The show featured two stages, namely a simple main stage with a pop0up set of stairs, an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] background screen, and glass risers for Suga Mama and The Mamas as well as a smaller [[B-stage]] in the midst of the audience for the later portions of the show. During the concerts, Beyoncé went through six costume changes; during the breaks, The Mamas harmonized.&lt;ref name="sftimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thrill" /&gt; The [[set list]] included songs from all of Beyoncé's three studio albums that had been published, a [[Destiny's Child]] medley and several covers of other artists.&lt;ref name="seattle" /&gt; Several critics noted that the songs on the set list were divided into ballads and more up-tempo songs to coincide with the central theme of ''I Am... Sasha Fierce'' – the dual personality of Beyoncé. Beyoncé's costumes were changed in order to coincide with the songs' nature; during performances of ballads, she wore longer white dresses while for the uptempo songs, she had more revealing outfits and make-up.&lt;ref name="omh" /&gt;

Thierry Mugler served as the main [[costume designer]] for the tour. Beyoncé was acquainted to and enraptured by his work at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute]] Gala, titled "Superheroes, Fashion and Fantasy" (2008) where she saw several of his [[haute couture]] pieces that were on display.&lt;ref name="claire" /&gt; Beyoncé discussed the possibility of using the costumes with [[Tina Knowles]].&lt;ref name="chron"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/life/article/Thierry-Mugler-re-creates-Beyonce-as-a-fierce-diva-1741497.php|title=Thierry Mugler re-creates Beyonce as a fierce diva|work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] ''via'' [[Houston Chronicle]]|first=Michael|last=Quintanilla|date=April 29, 2009|accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She met with Mugler in Paris in September of the same year and started exchanging ideas for costume designs and the following month he was contracted as the designer for the tour.&lt;ref name="chron" /&gt;&lt;ref name="march" /&gt; While designing, the main concept Mugler wanted to illustrate was the duality between "being a woman and a warrior" through his own creative perception; the words "Feminine.

Beyoncé is a very sophisticated 'stage animal', which means that she is truly instinctive. Beyoncé expresses herself through the two aspects of her personality."&lt;ref name="chron" /&gt; Furthermore, the elaborate costumes were related to the meanings of the songs performed.&lt;ref name="wwd.com" /&gt; 

A seventy one piece wardrobe was designed for Beyoncé and her dancers and band. For the shows, Beyoncé adopted ten different looks. American fashion designer [[Chris March]] also worked with Mugler ensuring the costumes were suitable for stage purposes. On July 23, 2009, March filed a lawsuit against Mugler for allegedly not paying him for the work he did on the wardrobe.&lt;ref name="march"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2009/08/christ_march_sues_theirry_mugl.html|title=Chris March Is Suing Thierry Mugler Over Beyoncé's Costumes|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|first=Amy|last=Odell|date=August 28, 2009|accessdate=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eonline.com/news/141470/project-runway-all-star-sues-over-beyonce-s-tour-togs|title=NEWS/ Project Runway All-Star Sues Over Beyoncé's Tour Togs|publisher=[[E!

==Critical response==
{{quote box|width=23em|align=right|quote=Beyonce's entrance at the O2 makes the finale of '[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]' seem like an exercise in tasteful understatement. As dry ice gusts wildly about the stage and [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] horns blare, a statuesque silhouette appears, hand on hips, head tilted imperiously. Then the swelling intro to 'Crazy In Love' kicks in, the smoke clears, and there stands Beyonce, superhumanly buff and glamorous. You are left in no doubt that tonight you are in the presence of pop royalty ... There's so much glittering spectacle that you could be at a lavish [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]] or a presidential inauguration ... Pop music doesn't get any smarter, sassier or more spectacular.

Ben Ratliff of ''The New York Times'' observed that the show would make spectators question themselves how the singer managed to put on a "dazzling show" both physically and organizationally; he further praised the singer's "hollering voice, her imperious movement, her costume changes and the show's crush of concepts with their long tails of reference".&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ratliff|first=Ben |title=Flash, Concepts and, Yes, Songs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/arts/music/23beyonce.html |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 22, 2009|accessdate=May 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deborah Mcaleese and Lauren Mulvenny of ''[[The Belfast Telegraph]]'' described the show as "incredible... mind blowing...

She also praised the singer's "enviable" dancing skills, "spectacular production and audio visuals" but noted that some songs "let down" the performance by being less melodic.&lt;ref name="perth" /&gt; Jay Lustig of ''The Star-Ledger'' described the show as a "bona fide pop spectacle" with futuristic themes throughout.&lt;ref name="nj.com" /&gt; Jim Farber from the ''Daily News'' viewed the tour as "a huge upgrade in charm, humor and chops" as compared to [[The Beyoncé Experience]] and added that "Beyoncé's presence punctuated her singing like an exclamation point".&lt;ref name="farber" /&gt;

Describing the show as simultaneously "spellbinding, exhausting to watch and hugely slick", Michael Cragg of [[musicOMH]] noted that the highlights included songs from the ''Sasha Fierce'' half of the album.&lt;ref name="omh" /&gt; Caryn Ganz of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine praised the show, lauding the singer for her work ethic and the ability to execute singing, dancing and posing at the same time.&lt;ref name="rolltour" /&gt; Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, commented "Through six outfit changes, bombastic ballads, high-energy singles and a daring high-wire journey from the stage to the center of the arena, Beyoncé delivered over and over again."&lt;ref name="thrill" /&gt; A writer of ''Billboard'' magazine noted that Knowles "brought all the fierceness" on stage for the tour.&lt;ref name="billrev" /&gt; ''[[The Australian]]''{{'}}s Patrick Emery noted that Knowles showcased her self-assurance and professionalism in "full view".&lt;ref name="australian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/arts-arc/choreographed-self-belief/story-e6frg8po-1225775188653|title=Choreographed self-belief|work=[[The Australian]]|first=Patrick|last=Emery|date=September 17, 2009|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing her performance with [[Michael Jackson]]'s live shows, Renee Michelle Harris of the ''South Florida Times'' writes, "[Knowles] owns the stage with her trademark swagger and intensity... showcasing her powerful vocals without missing a note, often while engaged in vigorous, perfectly executed dance moves".&lt;ref name="sftimes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Renee Michelle|title=Beyoncé Wows Crowd at BankAtlantic Center|url=http://www.sfltimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2977&amp;Itemid=1 |work=South Florida Times|date=July 3, 2009|accessdate=July 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holly Burnes of ''The Daily Telegraph'' noted that the performance was almost inimitable and added "Whether crumping, sweeping across the stage in towering heels, or simply standing still, Beyonce was dynamite, blasting the benchmark for concert performers forever".&lt;ref name="telegraphau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/beyonce-knowles-and-sasha-fierce-unite-sydney-ladies-fans-at-concert/story-e6frexar-1225776869209|title=Beyonce Knowles and Sasha Fierce unite Sydney ladies, fans at concert|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Holly|last=Burnes|date=September 19, 2009|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Simon Colling from ''The West Australian'' described the performance as "powerhouse" and added, "Beyonce's high-energy, high-voltage mix of song (loud, commercial R&amp;B) and dance recalled names like Tina Turner, [[Aretha Franklin]] and rapper [[Missy Elliott]]... [and] [[Mariah Carey]]".&lt;ref name="yahoo!!" /&gt; Joanna Horowitz of ''The Seattle Times'' noted that despite the inclusion of almost 10 different musical styles in the show's set list, the singer's "own [musical] signature" and focus were lacking. Nevertheless, Horowitz praised the singer's performing skills and summarized the concert as "a hip-hop [[Cirque du Soleil]] — sequins galore, dramatic dance numbers, and Beyoncé at one point soaring".&lt;ref name="seattle" /&gt; ''[[The Observer]]''{{'}}s Barbara Ellen wrote, "she is a force of nature – delivering one of the most enjoyable well-paced shows I've seen in years".&lt;ref name="observer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/24/beyonce|title=She's a woman of two halves|work=[[The Observer]]|first=Barbara|last=Ellen|date=May 24, 2009|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she noted that Knowles is "so steeped in professionalism that what should be magical can become mechanical."&lt;ref name="observer" /&gt; Noting influences by [[Tina Turner]] and [[Barbra Streisand]] during the tour, Ann Powers of ''Los Angeles Times'' writes: "And she danced like only Beyonce can dance, with a combination of power, grace and smarts that fully unites Broadway choreography with urban street innovations ... Indeed, her production can be seen as a retelling of pop's history from a feminine viewpoint -- and as an argument for Beyonce as the ultimate realization of the female pop dream."&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/13/entertainment/et-beyonce13|title=Pop Music Review – Live: Beyoncé at Honda Center|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Ann|last=Powers|authorlink=Ann Powers|date=July 13, 2009|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Ratliff of ''[[The New York Times]]'' summarized the tour's concept as "the duality of well-meaning good girl and rapacious animal-robot-dance-titan."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; Jay Lustig of ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' concluded that the album's split personality was reflected in the show naturally enough.&lt;ref name="nj.com" /&gt; However, Barbara Ellen of ''[[The Observer]]'' wrote, "Another irritant is the much-trumpeted 'duality' nonsense with Sasha Fierce, Beyoncé's alter-ego for her latest album. All 'Sasha' does here is flail about in a video, no different from regular Beyoncé, except for a gold dress and a hairdo that veers dangerously towards Liberace."&lt;ref name="observer" /&gt; Similarly, [[Ann Powers]] from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that the only thing which was not fully realized was the show's "overarching" theme, "Beyonce meant to represent herself as a split personality, tender and open on the one hand, indomitable and rather scary on the other. But Beyonce has chosen the wrong dichotomy to represent herself."&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt;

In September 2009, it was announced by the Associated Press that Knowles would be bringing her show to [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]] on October 25, 2009, but it would be without some of her usual tricks. After encountering what became familiar opposition from religious groups in a predominantly Muslim country, Knowles agreed to tone down some parts of her act. A spokesperson for the [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party]] stated: "We are against Western sexy performances; we don't think our people need that."&lt;ref name="Malaysia" /&gt; However, a rep soon came from the concert's Malaysian organizer, stating that "all parties have reached an amicable understanding" about the performance.&lt;ref name="Malaysia" /&gt; He went on saying that Knowles should be regarded as a "role model" and an "embodiment of success" because of her philanthropic work, including campaigns against poverty and domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Malaysia" /&gt; The Marctensia promoter further told the Associated Press: "We are confident that Beyoncé's concert will once and for all silence international critics and put Malaysia back on track and move up the ranks in presenting A-list international pop concerts in this region and further boost tourism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1622241/beyonce-agrees-tone-down-concert-malaysian-date.jhtml|title=Beyonce Agrees To Tone Down Concert For Malaysian Date|publisher=MTV News.

However, it was ultimately announced in October 2009 that the concert has been postponed in the wake of accusations by Islamic conservatives that the show would be "immoral and unclean".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/398075/beyonc-branded-immoral-by-malay-muslims.html|title=Beyoncé Branded 'Immoral' by Malay Muslims|work=[[Marie Claire]]|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysian promoter Marctensia said in a statement that the show has been postponed to a future date to be announced shortly, and added "The postponement is solely [the] decision of the artist and has nothing to with other external reasons."&lt;ref name="cancellation" /&gt; Another representative declined to comment on whether the show was postponed due to the heavy criticism it was receiving from religious leaders in the country.&lt;ref name="Malaysia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1624205/beyonces-malaysian-concert-postponed-again.jhtml|title=Beyonce's Malaysian Concert Postponed Again|publisher=MTV News.

== History ==
KamaGames was founded in 2010. A statement from the company's website says that its mission was to create high quality, innovative and engaging social casino games for mobile and other platforms. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.kamagames.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Pokerist''' launched that same year and remains the company's flagship title. It was followed by a range of social casino titles, including Roulettist in 2013, Baccarist in 2017 and Slots in 2018.
Initially, KamaGames products were launched in Europe, but soon expanded to the US, ASIAPAC &lt;ref&gt;http://www.engineersjournal.ie/2015/07/14/kamagames-announces-growth-strategy-100-jobs-three-years/), &lt;/ref&gt;,  the Middle East &lt;ref&gt;https://www.pocketgamer.biz/news/67749/kamagames-revenues-hit-57-5-million-in-2017/&lt;/ref&gt;, China&lt;ref&gt;https://www.valuebuddies.com/viewprwire.php?id=1330917&lt;/ref&gt;, CIS countries and India. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamingintelligence.com/games/45988-kamagames-launches-poker-champions-in-india&lt;/ref&gt;  
In addition to working as a developer and distributor, KamaGames has established partnerships in the US with Poker Night in America&lt;ref&gt;http://sbcamericas.com/2018/04/11/successful-partnerships-crucial-factor-kamagames-growth/&lt;/ref&gt; and with Yoozoo Games with the launch of Poker Champions in India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamingintelligence.com/games/45988-kamagames-launches-poker-champions-in-india&lt;/ref&gt; 
KamaGames’ audience ranges from mobile, to social networks and to players who play the games on Smart TVs. To further expand its reach, KamaGames has partnered with social networks VK.com&lt;ref&gt;http://www.igamingbusiness.com/news/kamagames-launch-first-html5-title-vkcom&lt;/ref&gt;, Facebook&lt;ref&gt;https://calvinayre.com/2018/02/14/press-releases/kamagames-launch-pokerist-texas-holdem-facebooks-instant-games/&lt;/ref&gt; and with the Viber&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mcvuk.com/development/kamagames-bringing-games-portfolio-to-viber&lt;/ref&gt; and the Tango messaging services.
2017 was a strong year for KamaGames with a gross revenue figure of $57.5 million being reported. According to their website, this was an increase of 63.4% on its previous year and also marked six consecutive quarters of growth for the company.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kamagames.com/news/we_are_kamagames&lt;/ref&gt;
In early 2018 the company also reached the milestone of having over 100 million players&lt;ref&gt;http://www.igamingbusiness.com/news/kamagames-smashes-100-million-player-barrier&lt;/ref&gt; enjoying their portfolio of social casino titles across the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.casinomeister.com/gambling-news/poker-news-weekly-round-june-1-2018/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product timeline ==
'''Pokerist Texas Poker'''
KamaGames released the first version of their flagship title Pokerist Texas Poker on iOS in April 2010 followed by Android in June 2010.
In April 2011 the game was released on Facebook, followed by a host of other platforms including Odnoklassniki.ru, Yandex, the Amazon Store,  Windows Phone, Facebook's Instant Games, SMART TV, Samsung Galaxy Apps and Apple TV.&lt;ref&gt;https://calvinayre.com/2016/05/27/press-releases/kamagames-announces-new-player-research-statistics-to-mark-pokerist-texas-pokers-6th-anniversary/&lt;/ref&gt;
Pokerist is an app game based on poker. 
Pokerist's “Party Modes” are variations on the game, including ’10 to Ace’ (which only deals the players high-value cards), ‘Joker’ (in which Jokers are wild) and more.
 
'''Roulettist, Blackjackist and Baccararist'''
KamaGames expanded their portfolio of social casino products with the release of Roulettist on iOS in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/roulettist&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Based on the classic casino game of Roulette, players are able to choose the type of game they want to play, from the classic European Roulette, to French Roulette, or riskier and American Roulette. The game was released on google play in April 2013 and then the Amazon Store on March 31st 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kamagames.roulettist&amp;hl=en_IE&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Subsequent KamaGames titles include Blackjackist, based on Blackjack in June 2016&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/blackjack-21-blackjackist&lt;/ref&gt;  and Baccarist, based on Baccarat in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.casinopedia.org/news/kamagames-3d-baccarat-baccarist&lt;/ref&gt;  

'''Omaha and Set Poker'''
KamaGames broadened their portfolio further in 2017 with the addition of Omaha Poker in April&lt;ref&gt;http://www.igamingbusiness.com/news/kamagames-expands-pokerist-omaha-poker&lt;/ref&gt; and Set Poker in December&lt;ref&gt;https://calvinayre.com/2017/12/22/press-releases/kamagames-announces-launch-latest-game-set-poker/&lt;/ref&gt;. The difference between Omaha and Texas Hold 'Em is that each player is dealt four cards instead of two and must make their best hand using two of them plus three of the five community cards.
 
'''Set Poker''' is similar to the Texas Hold ‘Em, but with side bets and with players also taking on the house. These side bets (named “Lucky 3” and “Lucky 6”) each have a set of winning combinations.
 
'''Slots'''
Taking its inspiration from casino slot machines, Slots was added to KamaGames’ portfolio in March 2018. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.igamingbusiness.com/press/kamagames-announces-slots-launch&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Craps''' Based on the immensely popular dice game enjoyed in casinos around the world, Craps is the first 3D multiplayer game of its kind launched on the '''App Store''' and '''Google Play''', released in August 2018. 
Players can choose from a range of betting styles, roll the dice and weigh up which odds and bets suit the most. &lt;ref&gt;http://g3newswire.com/ireland-kamagames-adds-craps-to-portfolio/&lt;/ref&gt;

KamaGames trialed a publishing programme in June 2013 with a vision to create partnerships and support other mobile games developers.  
The programme offered development studios a minimum investment of US $100,000 to fund the soft launch of their game whilst also providing guidance, expertise, localisation support and other back end services.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24603">'''Manic Pixie Dream Girl''' ('''MPDG''') is a [[stock character]] type in [[films]]. Film critic [[Nathan Rabin]], who coined the term after observing [[Kirsten Dunst]]'s character in ''[[Elizabethtown (film)|Elizabethtown]]'' (2005), said that the MPDG "exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive [[Screenwriter|writer]]-[[Film director|directors]] to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures."&lt;ref name="rabin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/my-year-of-flops-case-file-1-elizabethtown-the-bat,15577/ |title=My Year Of Flops, Case File 1: ''Elizabethtown'': The Bataan Death March of Whimsy |last=Rabin |first=Nathan |authorlink=Nathan Rabin |date=January 25, 2007 |website=[[The A.V. Club]] |accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; MPDGs are said to help their men without pursuing their own happiness, and such characters never grow up; thus, their men never grow up.&lt;ref name="welker"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Welker |first=Holly |date=February 12, 2010 |title=Forever Your Girl |journal=[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]] |issue=46 |pages=26–30 |url=https://bitchmedia.org/article/forever-your-girl |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manic Pixie Dream Girl has been compared to another stock character, the [[Magical Negro]], a [[black people|black]] character who seems to exist only to provide spiritual or mystical help to the [[White savior narrative in film|white savior protagonist]]. In both cases, the stock character has no discernible inner life, and usually only exists to provide the protagonist some important life lessons.&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bowman |first1=Donna |last2=Gillette |first2=Amelie |last3=Hyden |first3=Steven |last4=Murray |first4=Noel |last5=Pierce |first5=Leonard |last6=Rabin |first6=Nathan |date=August 4, 2008 |title=Wild things: 16 films featuring Manic Pixie Dream Girls |website=[[The A.V.

==Examples==
MPDGs are usually [[static characters]] who have [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] personality quirks and are unabashedly girlish. They invariably serve as the [[romantic interest]] for a (most often brooding or depressed) male [[protagonist]]. Examples of an MPDG are described below:
*An example is [[Natalie Portman]]'s character in the movie ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]'' (2004), written and directed by [[Zach Braff]].&lt;ref name="rabin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="welker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2008/08/07/manic_pixie/ |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111008063922/http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2008/08/07/manic_pixie/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 8, 2011 |title=The Natalie Portman problem |last=Berman |first=Judy |date=August 7, 2008 |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |accessdate=January 5, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of ''Garden State'', [[Roger Ebert]] also described this kind of rather unbelievable "movie creature" as "completely available" and "absolutely desirable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Garden State |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |website=Rogerebert.com |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/garden-state-2004 |date=August 6, 2004 |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' points to [[Katharine Hepburn]]'s character in ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938) as one of the earliest examples of the archetype.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; 
*The'' [[Filmspotting]]'' podcast created a list of Top Five Manic Pixie Dream Girls; Nathan Rabin appeared as a guest and created his own, separate list of MPDGs.&lt;ref name="filmspotting"/&gt;

===Counterexamples===
*The titular character of ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977) is often called a MPDG but is arguably not one, as she has her own goals independent of the male lead.{{r|kelly20130109}}
*[[Kate Winslet]]'s character Clementine in ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004) acknowledges the trope of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl and rejects the type, in a remark to [[Jim Carrey]]'s Joel: "Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive. But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's lookin' for my own peace of mind; don't assign me yours.”&lt;ref name="filmspotting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmspotting.net/reviews/624-fs-326-127-hours-top-5-manic-pixie-dream-girls.html |title=Top Five Manic Pixie Dream Girls |website=Filmspotting |date=November 19, 2010 |accessdate=June 26, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617034840/http://www.filmspotting.net/reviews/624-fs-326-127-hours-top-5-manic-pixie-dream-girls.html |archivedate=June 17, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Although [[Zooey Deschanel]]'s Summer in ''[[500 Days of Summer]]'' (2009) is often identified as a MPDG, the movie can be seen as a deconstruction of the trope because it shows the dangers of idealising women as things, rather than respecting them as real people with their own complex outlooks. Director [[Marc Webb]] stated, "Yes, Summer has elements of the manic pixie dream girl&amp;nbsp;– she is an immature view of a woman. She's Tom's view of a woman. He doesn't see her complexity and the consequence for him is heartbreak. In Tom's eyes, Summer is perfection, but perfection has no depth. Summer's not a girl, she's a phase."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/16/500-days-of-summer |title="'Is there such a thing as "the one" - and what happens if you lose her?" |newspaper=The Guardian |last=Wiseman |first=Eva |date=August 16, 2009 |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Eve, the lead character of [[Stuart Murdoch (musician)|Stuart Murdoch]]'s [[musical film]], ''[[God Help the Girl (film)|God Help the Girl]]'' (2014), has also been noted as a subversion of the trope, with actress [[Emily Browning]] approaching the character as "the anti-manic pixie dream girl" and describing her as having "her own inner life" and being "incredibly self-absorbed; [...] Olly wants her to be his muse and she's like, 'No, I'm not having that.

==Criticism and debate==
In an interview with Vulture, the entertainment section of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', about her film ''[[Ruby Sparks]]'', actress and screenwriter [[Zoe Kazan]] criticized the term as reductive, [[diminutive]], and [[misogynistic]]. She disagreed that Hepburn's character in ''Bringing Up Baby'' is a MPDG: "I think that to lump together all individual, original quirky women under that rubric is to erase all difference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/07/zoe-kazan-ruby-sparks-interview.html |title=Zoe Kazan on Writing ''Ruby Sparks'' and Why You Should Never Call Her a 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' |first=Patti |last=Greco |publisher=Vulture |date=July 23, 2012 |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a December 2012 video, [[AllMovie]] critic Cammila Collar embraced the term as an effective description of one-dimensional female characters who only seek the happiness of the male protagonist, and who do not deal with any complex issues of their own. The pejorative use of the term, then, is mainly directed at writers who do not give these female characters more to do than bolster the spirits of their male partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMsrwfbyxMo |title=Semantic Breakdown: The Manic Pixie Dream Bitch |work=[[YouTube]] |date=December 14, 2012 |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''{{'}}s Aisha Harris posited that "critiques of the MPDG may have become more common than the archetype itself", suggesting that filmmakers had been forced to become "self-aware about such characters" in the years since Rabin's coining of the phrase and that the trope had largely disappeared from film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Harris |first=Aisha |title=Is the Manic Pixie Dream Girl Dead? |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/12/05/manic_pixie_prostitute_video_is_the_latest_critique_of_the_manic_pixie_dream.html |website=Slate |publisher=The Slate Group |date=December 5, 2012 |accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Kat Stoeffel, for ''[[New York (magazine)|The Cut]]'', argued that the term itself had become sexist, citing her opinion that "it was levied, criminally at [[Diane Keaton]] in ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and [[Zooey Deschanel]], the actual person. ''How could a real person's defining trait be a lack of interior life?"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stoeffel |first=Kat |title=The 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' Has Died |url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/07/manic-pixie-dream-girl-has-died.html |website=The Cut |publisher=New York Media LLC. |accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

Similar sentiments were elucidated by Monika Bartyzel for ''[[The Week]]'' in April 2013, who wrote "this once-useful piece of critical shorthand has devolved into laziness and sexism". Bartyzel argues that "[The term] 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' was useful when it commented on the superficiality of female characterizations in male dominated journeys, but it has since devolved into a pejorative way to deride unique women in fiction and reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bartyzel |first=Monika |title=Girls on Film: Why it's time to retire the term 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' |url=http://theweek.com/article/index/243265/girls-on-film-why-its-time-to-retire-the-term-manic-pixie-dream-girl |website=The Week |publisher=The Week Publications, Inc. |date=April 26, 2013 |accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retraction of the term==
In July 2014, for ''Salon'', Rabin prompted a retraction of the term "Manic Pixie Dream Girl". He argued that in "giving an idea a fuzzy definition", he inadvertently gave the phrase power it was not intended to have. The trope's popularity, Rabin suggested, led to discussions of a more precise definition, a reduction of the critic's all-encompassing classification of MPDG. While he coined the term to expose the sexist implications in modern culture, the "phrase was increasingly accused of being sexist itself". Backlash occurred when many well-loved female characters were placed under this trope. In response, Rabin suggested that nuanced characters cannot be classified in such a restricted nature, and thus he apologized to pop culture for "creating this unstoppable monster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/07/15/im_sorry_for_coining_the_phrase_manic_pixie_dream_girl/ |date=July 15, 2014 |title=I'm sorry for coining the phrase "Manic Pixie Dream Girl": In 2007, I invented the term in a review. Then I watched in queasy disbelief as it seemed to take over pop culture |first=Nathan |last=Rabin |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manic Pixie Dream Boy==
Recently there has been discussion of a male version of this trope, the Manic Pixie Dream Boy or Manic Pixie Dream Guy. Augustus Waters from the film version of ''[[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|The Fault in Our Stars]]'' (2014) was given this title in a 2014 [[Vulture.com|''Vulture'']] article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Patches |first=Matt |title=He's Perfect, He's Awful: The Case Against The Fault in Our Stars' Gus Waters |url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/06/case-against-fault-in-our-stars-gus-waters-manic-pixie-dream-guy.html |website=Vulture |publisher=''New York Magazine''|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Matt Patches stated, "he's a bad boy, he's a sweetheart, he's a dumb jock, he's a nerd, he's a philosopher, he's a poet, he's a victim, he's a survivor, he's everything everyone wants in their lives, and he's a fallacious notion of what we can ''actually'' have in our lives."

The Manic Pixie Dream Boy trope has also been pointed out in sitcoms such as ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'' and ''[[30 Rock]]''. The female protagonists of these shows are married to men ([[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]]'s [[Ben Wyatt (Parks and Recreation)|Ben Wyatt]] and [[James Marsden]]'s Criss Chros, respectively), who, according to a 2012 ''[[Grantland]]'' article, "patiently [tamp] down her stubbornness and temper while appreciating her quirks, helping her to become her best possible self".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lambert |first=Molly |title=1D Internet Fantasies: Liz Lemon, One Direction, and the Rise of the Manic Pixie Dream Guy |url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/1d-internet-fantasies-liz-lemon-one-direction-and-the-rise-of-the-manic-pixie-dream-guy/ |publisher=Grantland |accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character Jesse, played by [[Skylar Astin]], in the film ''[[Pitch Perfect]]'' (2012) embodies the Manic Pixie Dream Boy trope. His role in the film appears to be to coax the very serious character Beca, played by [[Anna Kendrick]], out of her gloom and embrace life to the fullest. He has no backstory of his own, and no major goals of his own in the context of the film. According to an article on Ohio State's Entertainment News site.

{{Quote|Jesse, the male protagonist, never fails to break my heart. His character is seemingly flawless: he is sweet, charming, funny, boyishly handsome, and talented, but in a self-deprecating way. The character radiates youthful appeal in a way that makes me want to sit close to him and watch John Hughes movies with him. He takes on the selfless task of cracking open the stony girl protagonist by showing her ''The Breakfast Club'' and becomes a victim—Jesse is unusual. Jesse is a background story-less charisma machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://osu.uloop.com/news/view.php/60295/Boys-and-Girls-in-Current-Film-A-Glimps/ |title=Boys and Girls in Current Film: A Glimpse into 'Manic Pixies' |first=Lacey |last=Ross |date=December 25, 2012 |publisher=[[Uloop]] |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Algorithm-defined fantasy girl===
{{See also|Magical girlfriend}}
Another version of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl is the algorithm-defined fantasy girl. The difference is that the latter is not human, but a robot or artificial intelligence of some sort. The function is the same one: to fulfill the desires of the male character and to help him in his journey without having any desires or journey of her own. Some examples are: Joi in ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]'' and Samantha in [[Spike Jonze]]'s ''[[Her (film)|Her]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/11/16455282/blade-runner-2049-analysis-ana-de-armas-fantasy-girl|title=Blade Runner 2049 continues questionable trend of the ‘algorithm-defined fantasy girl’|first=Julia|last=Alexander|date=11 October 2017|website=Polygon|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/15/ex-machina-sexy-female-robots-scifi-film-obsession&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marathon was born as one of the projects created by Blanca Calvo, director of the Library of Guadalajara, when in 1982 she promoted the Seminary of Children and Youth Literature of Guadalajara, which in addition to the Marathon organized the National Encounters of Animation of Reading between 1984-1996

The first edition was held on April 23, 1992 as part of the activities program of the Guadalajara Book Fair, which included oral narration. That first edition lasted 24 hours, from 12 noon on Friday to 12 on Saturday, with the goal in turn to enter the Guinness Book of Records. In this marathon participated personalities such as [[Antonio Buero Vallejo]] and [[José Luis Sampedro]].
&lt;ref&gt;Maratón de los Cuentos. ''[http://www.maratondeloscuentos.org/spip/spip.php?rubrique43 Historia]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 the Marathon was held for the first time in the palace of the Infantado and reached 36 and a half hours.

Since then, and thanks to the collaboration of the Seminary of Children and Youth Literature of Guadalajara, it ended up defining what is now known as the "Marathon of the Tales of Guadalajara", which takes place in the courtyard of the Lions of the [[Palace of Infantado]] uninterrupted during the weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|year=2011|url=http://maratondeloscuentos.org/|title=Página oficial del Maratón de los Cuentos de Guadalajara - MaratondelosCuentos.org|accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:集落最後のマタギ.jpg|thumb|Satō Ryōzō, a Matagi of Yagisawa settlement in [[Kamikoani, Akita]] in 1958, with the [[Murata rifle]] on his back]]
The '''Matagi''' ({{lang-ja|又鬼}}) are traditional winter hunters of the [[Tōhoku region]] of northern [[Japan]], most famously today in the [[Shirakami-Sanchi]] forest between [[Akita, Akita|Akita]] and [[Aomori, Aomori|Aomori]]. They hunt deer and bear, and their culture has much in common with the [[bear worship]] of the [[Ainu people|Ainu]]. They live in small hamlets of the mountain beech forests of Tōhoku and engage in agriculture during the planting and harvest season. In the winter and early spring, they form hunting bands that spend weeks at a time in the forest. With the introduction of guns in the 20th century, the need for group hunting for bear has diminished, leading to a decline in Matagi culture. 

Matagi hamlets are found in the districts of [[Nishitsugaru District, Aomori|Nishitsugaru]] and [[Nakatsugaru District, Aomori|Nakatsugaru]] ([[Aomori Prefecture]]), [[Kitaakita District, Akita|Kitaakita]] and [[Senboku District, Akita|Senboku]] ([[Akita Prefecture]]), [[Waga District, Iwate|Waga]] ([[Iwate Prefecture]]), [[Nishiokitama District, Yamagata|Nishiokitama]] and [[Tsuruoka, Yamagata|Tsuruoka]] ([[Yamagata Prefecture]]), [[Murakami, Niigata|Murakami]] and [[Nakauonuma District, Niigata|Nakauonuma]] ([[Niigata Prefecture]] and [[Nagano Prefecture]]). 

The Matagi are attested from the medieval period but continue to hunt today. They have come into conflict with environmentalists now that the forest has been partly cleared.&lt;ref&gt;"Matagi: Hunters as Intermediaries Between 'Wild' and 'Domestic.'" Scott Schnell, Japan Anthropology Workshop, March 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They no longer hunt the [[Japanese serow]], which is protected, but continue to hunt bear. Matagi hunt by special license.

Specialised Matagi hunting vocabulary contains [[Ainu language|Ainu]] words.&lt;ref&gt;Kudō Masaki (1989:134). ''Jōsaku to emishi''. Kōkogaku Library #51. New Science Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanigawa, Ken'ichi (1980:324–325). ''Collected works'', vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the word ''matagi'' itself may be Ainu, from ''matangi'' or ''matangitono'', "man of winter, hunter".&lt;ref&gt;''mata'' 'winter', ''tono'' 'leader'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary references==

Matagi are referenced and described in the biographical novel ''[[Dog Man: An Uncommon Life on a Faraway Mountain]]'' by Martha Sherrill, alongside descriptions of a real modern day Matagi named Uesugi, who was a friend of the main characters who helped preserve the [[Akita (dog)|Akita]] breed of dog, which they used extensively for hunting.

{{Rhetoric}}
'''Memoria''' was the term for aspects involving [[memory]] in Western classical [[rhetoric]]. The word is Latin, and can be translated as "memory".

It was one of five canons in classical rhetoric (the others being [[inventio]], [[dispositio]], [[elocutio]], and [[pronuntiatio]]) concerned with the crafting and delivery of speeches and prose.

The art of rhetoric grew out of [[Public speaking|oratory]], which was the central medium for intellectual and political life in ancient Greece. Legal proceedings, political debates, philosophical inquiry were all conducted through spoken discourse. Many of the great texts from that age were not written texts penned by the authors we associate them with, but were instead orations written down by followers and students. In Roman times, while there was a much greater body of written work, oration was still the medium
for critical debate. Unlike public speakers of today, who use notes or who read their speeches, good orators were expected to deliver their speeches without such aids.

''Memoria'' was the discipline of recalling the arguments of a discourse. It generally received less attention from writers than 
other parts of rhetoric, as there is less to be said about the subject. However, the need to memorize speeches did influence the structure of discourse to some extent. For example, as part of ''dispositio'', some attention was paid to creating structures (such as the ''[[Dispositio|divisio]]'', an outline of the major arguments of a discourse) that would also aid memory. Some writers also discussed the use of various mnemonic devices to assist speakers.

But rhetoricians also viewed ''memoria'' as requiring more than just rote memorization. Rather, the orator also had to have at his command a wide body of knowledge to permit improvisation, to respond to questions, and to refute opposing arguments. Where today's speech-making tends to be a staged, one-way affair, in former times, much oration occurred as part of debates, dialogues, and other settings, in which orators had to react to others. Moreover, rhetoricians also recognized that the credibility of a speaker depended not just on the strength of his prepared arguments, but on the audience's perceptions of the speaker. In Greece, Rome, and the Renaissance, a speaker's familiarity of many areas of learning was seen as a virtue.

==In the Renaissance==
When the Humanists took up the ideas on memory found the writings of Classical authors, memoria played an important role in the pedagogical system. Texts were learned first by rote memorization, then re-read for meaning. Children's ability to memorize was aided by "[[memory table]]s", which were first available in manuscript form, and were, from the 1470s onwards, some of the first products of the printing press. (Source: Paul Gehl, ''A Moral Art: Grammar, Society, and Culture in Trecento Florence'' (1993)

==Memory and Kairos==
Memory, the fourth canon of rhetoric, and invention, the first canon, are connected. The [[Rhetorica ad Herennium|ad Herennium]] states that memory is the “treasury of things invented”, indirectly referring to the custom of accumulating commonplaces. Hence, for a rhetor, memory is as much related to the need to extemporize as to the necessity to memorize a discourse for delivery; in this way it is linked to [[kairos]] and to the ideas of [[Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style|copia]] and amplification (Burton).

Crowley and Hawhee state about memory and kairos, "... kairos and memory were partnered in several ways. First, both require a kind of 'attunement' in that the rhetor who is gathering items for reserve in the memory must be thinking simultaneously about what's available now that might be useful later. Secondly, memory requires an attunement during the moment of speaking or composing, a recognition of the right time for recalling an illustrative example, an argument, and so on" (317).

==Memory Systems==
Ancient peoples used [[Art of memory|elaborate systems]], such as the [[Method of loci|Method of Loci]], to store large amounts of information in their memories. Today, we use literate and electronic memory systems. Literate memory systems include books, periodicals, and libraries. Electronic systems include computers, databases, computer software, the World Wide Web, and other artificial memory devices (Crowley and Hawhee 325-28).

==The Three Elements of the Canon of Memory==
'''Memorizing One's Speech'''
Centuries ago, ancient orators had to memorize and present speeches without the help of note cards or crib sheets. Note taking, as a way to remember certain things, was looked down upon in ancient cultures. In his Phaedrus, Plato has Socrates explaining that relying on writing or taking notes weakened the mind and memory:

''"If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls: they will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves"''{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Any Greek in Ancient times who was caught using the note-taking method would be laughed at and deemed "weak-minded".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Nowadays, it is much more common for speakers to use note cards, though speeches are much more impressive without the use of notes.
 
Using memory during a speech can also affect how the orator influences the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alvi|first=Sofia Dildar|author2=Abdul Baseer|title=An Analysis Of Barack Obama's Speech 'Keynote Address At The 2004 Democratic National Convention'.|journal=Language in India|date=2011|volume=11|issue=10|pages=310–335}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the speaker addresses the audiences relying solely on their memory, they build a certain amount of ethos within the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cazacu|first=Aurel M.|title=Seneca - The Rhetor.|journal=Annals of Spiru Haret University, Journalism Studies|date=2011|volume=12|issue=1|pages=85–87|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e25cba9d-788c-4066-9d30-6cb47a9e44a1%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=10&amp;hid=118|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memoria in relation to ethos during a speech situation can be described as a certain amount trustworthiness felt between the audience, as well as a level of similarity, authority, or expertise that the orator has over the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Ota Thomas|title=American Public Address And The Mass Media.|journal=Western Speech|date=1968|volume=32|issue=1|pages=44–49|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e25cba9d-788c-4066-9d30-6cb47a9e44a1%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=13&amp;hid=118|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Ancient Greece, in today's society, it is much more acceptable for politicians and for people of authority to use aids when delivering addresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Ota Thomas|title=American Public Address And The Mass Media.|journal=Western Speech|date=1968|volume=32|issue=1|pages=44–49|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e25cba9d-788c-4066-9d30-6cb47a9e44a1%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=13&amp;hid=118|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it could be viewed as an aid to use notes or teleprompters, greater importance is placed on actually conveying the information to the audience in a clear and concise manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alvi|first=Sofia Dildar|author2=Abdul Baseer|title=An Analysis Of Barack Obama's Speech 'Keynote Address At The 2004 Democratic National Convention'.|journal=Language in India|date=2011|volume=11|issue=10|pages=310–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Making One's Speech Memorable'''
For ancient orators, the excellence of how a speech was presented was more important than the simple delivery of the speech. An important feature of delivering a speech was finding ways to make one's audience remember one's speech topic. One had to be sure to one's audience learned the information or ideas presented to it.

'''Keeping a Treasury of Rhetorical Fodder'''
The third element of memory has to do with using quotes, facts, or anecdotes that could be used in future speeches. A professional orator is known to always have a treasury of rhetorical fodder close at all times.

'''Nils Vilhelm Almlöf''' (1799–1875) was a Swedish stage actor.  He was one of the most famous Swedish actors of his time and referred to as "The Swedish [[François Joseph Talma|Talma]]."

He was born to Nils Almlöf, a servant of the royal household, and Maria Lovisa Herbelin.  He interrupted his medical studies to study singing under [[Carl Magnus Craelius]] of the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] in 1818, where he made his breakthrough as Leicester in Schiller's ''Mary Stuart'' opposite [[Charlotta Eriksson]] in 1821.  He was a star at the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] for sixty years, where he was a notable male actor in tragedy.   When he visited Paris in 1829, he was called the "Swedish Talma" by [[Mademoiselle Mars]].   In 1834 he had a wage of §1800, the highest paid by the theatre.   He was teacher of declamation at ''[[Dramatens elevskola]]'' 1834–40. 

Almlöf and his second wife, Charlotte, as well as other actors, such as [[Elise Hwasser]], was good friends with King [[Charles XV of Sweden]], and was often invited to his ball games during his reign as Crown Prince regent (1857–59).

He was first married to his colleague, [[Catharina Cederberg]], and then to actor [[Charlotta Almlöf|Charlotta Ficker]], also a successful actor at the Royal Dramatic Theatre. His son with his first wife, [[Knut Almlöf]], was also an actor.

== Weddings ==
''OK!'' is best known for its coverage of celebrity nuptials. 

In 2000, ''OK!'' had exclusive rights to publish photographs of the wedding of [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] and [[Michael Douglas]], but its rival ''[[Hello!]]'' magazine published pictures as well, and ''OK!'' sued. It was awarded [[pound sterling|£]]1,033,156 in an initial judgment, but lost it on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Tench, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/may/23/mondaymediasection13 Photo finish], ''The Guardian'', 3 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2005, three celebrity weddings took place on the same day: those of [[Katie Price]] and [[Peter Andre]], [[Kate Garraway]] and [[Derek Draper]], and [[Samia Ghadie]] and property developer Matthew Smith. ''OK!'' covered them all over separate issues. The biggest wedding of the three (Price and Andre) was covered over two bumper issues.

The same happened for the wedding of [[Ashley Cole|Ashley]] and [[Cheryl Cole]], as well as [[Christina Aguilera]]'s. ''OK!'' devoted an issue to photos of [[Tony Parker]] and [[Eva Longoria]]'s wedding.

Other weddings covered by ''OK!'' are:
*[[Natasha Hamilton]] and Riad Erraji (November 2007)
*[[Kerry Katona]] and Mark Croft (February 2007)
*[[Holly Willoughby]] and Dan Baldwin (August 2007)

==Controversies==

Prior to [[Jade Goody]]'s cancer-related death in March 2009, ''OK!'' sparked controversy by publishing an "Official Tribute Issue" with the front-page captions "In Loving Memory" and "1981-2009," even though Goody was still alive when the issue went to press.&lt;ref&gt;Marina Hyde, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/21/jade-goody-ok-magazine The Jade obituary issue just shows how deeply OK! cares], ''The Guardian'', 21 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, ''OK!'' ran another tribute issue, this time for [[Michael Jackson]]. The publication had paid a reported $500,000 for images of Jackson's body being retrieved after his death. The cover photo showed a deceased Jackson on a stretcher, in a neck brace and with an oxygen mask. "It’s a photo that captures the surprise and the upset and the moment of this breaking news story," Sarah Ivens, the magazine's editorial director, said. "I hope the cover will provoke readers." 

In 2010, the magazine faced more criticism after running a cover story on [[Kourtney Kardashian]]'s pregnancy. It published a cover photo of Kardashian holding her son, Mason, and claimed to feature an exclusive interview revealing the secrets to her weight loss. Kardashian tweeted in response, "One of those weeklies got it wrong again…they didn’t have an exclusive with me. And I gained 40 pounds [18 kg] while pregs, not 26 [12 kg]…But thanks!" She also alleged that the body on the cover was not hers, and that ''OK!'' had Photoshopped her face onto someone else's body.

''OK!'' came under fire again in July 2013 when it published an issue featuring [[Kate Middleton]] on the same day she left the hospital after giving birth to [[Prince George of Cambridge|Prince George]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Driscoll| first1=Brogan| title=OK!

Like the rest of the world, we were very moved by her radiance as she and William introduced the Prince of Cambridge to the world. We would not dream of being critical of her appearance. If that was misunderstood on our cover it was not intended."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Sweney| first1=Mark| title=OK! apologises for royal post-birth weight loss regime story| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jul/24/ok-apologies-duchess-cambridge-weight-loss-story| accessdate=22 February 2015| date=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Palant''' is a Polish game similar to [[baseball]], played using a wooden stick and rubber balls. Similar games are German [[Schlagball]], Russian [[lapta (game)|lapta]] and Romanian [[oină]].
In his book ''[[God's Playground]]'' [[Norman Davies]] suggests that the popular US game, baseball, may have developed from Palant played by the first Polish immigrants such as [[Jamestown Polish craftsmen]].

==Rules==
The players are divided into two teams of 7 to 15 players. The playing field is 25 by 60 meters in size, and the wooden stick has 60–88&amp;nbsp;centimeters in length. You have to draw the "heaven" and "hell" fields. Reflecting team is trying to maintain as long as possible to "heaven" field for customs clearance wooden stick and finish the race. Team being on the "hell" field seeks to obtain the "heaven". For this purpose, trying to catch the ball in his hands as soon as possible to reject the heaven, so as to withhold as many players on the "hell". The team of "heaven" is set before the line "heaven" and the team "hell" for the line drawn to pierce the ball. The duration of the game twice after 20 minutes, you can set a limit being in "heaven" and "hell." The players located on the "heaven" bounce the ball behind the line designated with a wooden stick. Reflection is important when the ball sailed above the ground or on the ground the center line. Reflection is invalid when Batsman release the wooden stick of the hand, himself not toss balls, or he will not hit the ball.

After contacting the ball by a player in "heaven" pushes the stick and begins to defeat the base, task players in "hell" as soon as possible transfer balls to heaven. If a player misses, not strikes are set to run. For each running a yields one point. When a team from "hell" catch the ball in one hand directly during the flight that goes to heaven. Caught in the basket (with both hands) gets one point. These rules can vary and change. When playing e.g. After 5 miniute upstairs (in heaven) and players from hell will not make the transition a n-el informs that the sides. The winning team that has the greatest number of points in a given time.

The title refers to the mathematical constant [[pi]].{{efn|The film's title sequence shows the Greek letter {{pi}}, followed by hundreds of lines of numbers representing the numerical value of the constant. However, the numbers are not accurate past the first eight decimal places.}} The film is notable for its covering of an array of themes including religion, mysticism and the relationship of the universe to mathematics.

The story is about a mathematician and the obsession with mathematical regularity contrasts two seemingly irreconcilable entities: the imperfect, irrational humanity and the rigor and regularity of mathematics, specifically [[number theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Skorin-Kapov, Jadranka (2015) [https://www.amazon.com/Darren-Aronofskys-Films-Fragility-Hope/dp/1501306979/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8  Darren Aronofsky's Films and the Fragility of Hope], [[Bloomsbury Academic]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
{{Long plot|date=July 2018}}
Unemployed and living in a drab [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] apartment in [[New York City]], Max Cohen is a [[Number theory|number theorist]] who believes that everything in nature can be understood through numbers. Max suffers from [[cluster headache]]s, as well as extreme [[paranoia]], [[hallucination]]s, and [[social anxiety disorder]]. His only social interactions are with Jenna, a young girl fascinated with his ability to mentally do complex calculations; Devi, a young woman living next door; and Sol Robeson, his old mathematics mentor who is now an invalid.

Max tries to program his computer, Euclid, to make stock predictions. Euclid malfunctions, prints out a seemingly random 216-digit number, as well as a single pick at one-tenth its current value, then crashes. Disgusted, Max throws away the printout. The next morning, he finds out that the pick Euclid made was accurate. He searches desperately but cannot find the printout. When he mentions the number, Sol becomes unnerved and asks if it contained 216 digits. When Max questions him about the number, Sol indicates that he came across it many years ago. He urges Max to slow down and take a break.

At a coffee shop he frequents, Max meets Lenny Meyer, a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jew]] who does mathematical research on the [[Torah]]. Lenny demonstrates some simple [[Gematria]], the correspondence of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] to numbers, and explains how some people believe that the Torah is a string of numbers that form a code sent by God. Max is intrigued, noting some of the concepts are similar to other mathematical concepts such as the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]]. Max is also approached by agents of a Wall Street firm. One of the agents, Marcy Dawson, offers Max a classified computer chip called "Ming Mecca" in exchange for the results of his work.

Using the Ming Mecca chip, Max has Euclid analyze mathematical patterns in the Torah. Once again, Euclid shows the 216-digit number on the screen before crashing. As Max begins to write down the number, he realizes that he knows the pattern, undergoes a sudden [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], and passes out. After waking up, Max appears to become clairvoyant and is able to visualize the stock market patterns he had been searching for. However, his headaches also increase in intensity, and he discovers a strange vein-like bulge protruding from his right temple. Max has a falling out with Sol after the latter urges him to quit his work.

One evening, Dawson and her agents grab Max on the street and try to force him to explain the number. They had found the original printout Max threw away. In an attempt to use it to manipulate the stock market, the firm caused the market to crash instead. Lenny drives by and helps Max get away. However, Lenny takes Max to his companions at a nearby synagogue. They ask Max to give them the 216-digit number, believing it was meant for them to bring about the [[messianic age]], as the number represents the [[Shemhamphorasch|unspeakable name of God]]. Max refuses, insisting that whatever the source of the number is, it has been revealed to him alone.

Max flees and visits Sol, only to find out he recently died from another stroke, and finds a piece of paper with the number in his study. Back in his own apartment, Max experiences another headache, but does not take his painkillers. Driven to the brink of madness, he destroys part of Euclid. Believing that the number and the headaches are linked, Max tries to concentrate on the number through the pain. After passing out, Max has a vision of himself standing in a white void and repeating the digits of the number. The vision ends with Max hugging Devi, who turns out to be a hallucination. Standing alone in his trashed apartment, Max burns the paper with the number and blithely performs an impromptu [[trepanning]] on himself with an inadequate [[cranial drill]].

Some time later, Jenna approaches Max in a park and asks him to do several calculations, including 748 ÷ 238 (an approximation for [[pi]]){{efn|1=Since 748/238 = 22/7 X 34/34, this was a "slow pitch" question.}} Max smiles and says that he doesn't know the answer to them. He sits on the bench and watches the trees blowing in the breeze, seemingly at peace.

The website's critical consensus reads: "Dramatically gripping and frighteningly smart, this Lynchian thriller does wonders with its unlikely subject and shoestring budget."&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|Pi}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Metacritic, the film has a rating of 72 out of 100 based on 23 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{metacritic film|pi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three and a half stars out of four, writing: "''Pi'' is a thriller. I am not very thrilled these days by whether the bad guys will get shot or the chase scene will end one way instead of another. You have to make a movie like that pretty skillfully before I care. But I am thrilled when a man risks his mind in the pursuit of a dangerous obsession."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/pi-1998 |title=Pi |date=July 24, 1998 |accessdate=April 11, 2018 |work=RogerEbert.com |publisher=Ebert Digital LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] gave the film three out of four stars, writing: "[''Pi''] transports us to a world that is like yet unlike our own, and, in its mysterious familiarity, is eerie, intense, and compelling. Reality is a fragile commodity, but, because the script is well-written and the central character is strongly developed, it's not hard to suspend disbelief....It probably deserves 3.1416 stars, but since my scale doesn't support that, I'll round it off to three."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berardinelli |first=James |url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/p/pi.html |title={{pi}} (Pi) |work=ReelViews |date=1998 |accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==

=== Mathematics ===
''Pi'' features multiple references to mathematics and mathematical theories.{{efn|Much, and even most ( if not all, ) of the mathematical imagery consists of graphical matter to be found in "Jahnke and Emde." That is the Dover Edition of Tables of Functions by Eugene Jahnke and Fritz Emde.}} For instance, Max finds the [[golden spiral]] occurring everywhere, including the stock market. Max's belief that diverse systems embodying highly [[Dynamical system|nonlinear dynamics]] share a unifying pattern bears much similarity to results in [[chaos theory]], which provides machinery for describing certain phenomena of nonlinear systems, which might be thought of as patterns. During the climactic drill scene, a pattern resembling a [[bifurcation diagram]] is apparent on Max's shattered mirror.

=== The game of Go ===
In the film, Max periodically plays [[Go (game)|Go]] with his mentor, Sol.&lt;ref name="PiGo"&gt;{{citation | title = The Game of Go | url = http://www.pithemovie.com/go.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140222005937/http://www.pithemovie.com/go.html | archivedate = 22 February 2014 | deadurl = yes | publisher = PiTheMovie.com | accessdate = 2008-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This game has historically stimulated the study of mathematics&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/special/gomath.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110608021213/http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/special/gomath.html | archivedate = 8 June 2011 | deadurl = yes | magazine = MindZine | title = Go and Mathematics | last = Fairbairn | first = John }}&lt;/ref&gt; and features a simple set of rules that results in a [[Go complexity|complex game strategy]]. The two characters each use the game as a model for their view of the universe; Sol says that the game is a microcosm of an extremely complex and chaotic world, while Max asserts its complexity gradually converges toward patterns that can be found.&lt;ref name="PiGo"/&gt;{{efn|'''SOL''': Listen to me. The Ancient Japanese considered the Go board a microcosm of the universe. When it is empty it appears simple and ordered, but the possibilities of game play are endless. They say that no two Go games have ever been alike. Just like snowflakes. So, the Go board actually represents an extremely complex and chaotic universe. That is the truth of our world, Max. It can't be easily summed up with math. There is no simple pattern.&lt;br&gt;'''MAX''': But as a Go game progresses, the possibilities become smaller and smaller. The board does take on order. Soon, all moves are predictable.&lt;br&gt;'''SOL''': So?&lt;br&gt;'''MAX''': So, maybe, even though we're not sophisticated enough to be aware of it, there is an underlying order... a pattern, beneath every Go game. Maybe that pattern is like the pattern in the market, in the Torah. The two sixteen number.}}

Both Gullette and Margolis spent many hours learning the game at the [[Brooklyn]] Go Club, and had the help of a Go consultant, Dan Weiner, for the film.&lt;ref name="PiGo"/&gt;  The film credits list Barbara Calhoun, Michael Solomon and Dan Wiener as Go consultants.

=== Kabbalah ===
Early in the film, when Lenny begins talking with Max about his work, he asks if Max is familiar with [[kabbalah]]. The numerological interpretation of the Torah and the 216-letter name of God, known as the [[Shemhamphorasch|Shem HaMeforash]], are important concepts in traditional Jewish mysticism.

=== Quran ===
Another religious reference is when Max is in the market looking for today's newspaper, there is a recitation from [[Quran]], in the background, citing Quran 2:140: "Or do you say that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants were Jews or Christians? Say, "Are you more knowing or is Allah?" And who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony he has from Allah? And Allah is not unaware of what you do."

'''''Power Rangers Mystic Force''''' is an American television series and the fourteenth season of the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchise, based on the ''[[Super Sentai]]'' series, ''[[Mahou Sentai Magiranger]]''. As with all ''Power Rangers'' series, the show is adapted from a series in the long-running Japanese [[tokusatsu]] franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/09/a-visual-history-of-every-power-rangers-team-costume|title=A Visual History of Every Power Rangers Team Costume|first=Max|last=Nicholson|date=9 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series officially premiered on February 20, 2006 on [[Toon Disney]] / [[Jetix]], February 25, 2006 on [[ABC Family]], March 11, 2006 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] as part of the [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]] programming block and on June 4, 2006 on [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family]] in [[Canada]], on October 2, 2006 on [[Jetix]] in [[India]], October 21, 2006 on [[Jetix]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The show was also broadcast on Sunday morning on ITV1 and the CITV Channel under the GMTV Toonattik slot in April 1, 2007. In the [[Philippines]] it premiered on October 6, 2007 in [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Toonami]]'' slot. It was also the last season to air on ABC Family, when the channel dropped Jetix on August 31, 2006.

''Power Rangers Mystic Force'' is the first and only [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]-produced ''Power Rangers'' series to feature the main villain from its ''Super Sentai'' counterpart, and is the first of the Disney-produced ''Power Rangers'' series in which all the actors playing the five core Rangers are of [[Australians|Australian]] or [[New Zealanders|New Zealander]] descent (the casts of the three Disney-produced ''Power Rangers'' series prior to ''Mystic Force'' had at least one Ranger actor of [[North American]] descent). This is also the second [[Power Rangers]] season to not have an African American Ranger similar to ''[[Power Rangers Ninja Storm|Ninja Storm]]'' and the change of actors from [[North American]] to [[Australians|Australian]] or [[New Zealanders|New Zealander]] descent. 

It is also the only ''Power Rangers'' series in which the Rangers wear capes. This is the second Disney series that does not have a teamup with the previous season's rangers. The first was ''[[Power Rangers Ninja Storm]]''. In Mystic Force's case, the missing crossover would have been with ''[[Power Rangers S.P.D.]]'' However, a character from that series, Piggy cameoed in the episode "Ranger Down". Xander Bly later returned for the ''[[Power Rangers Operation Overdrive|Operation Overdrive]]'' 15th anniversary special "[[List of Power Rangers Operation Overdrive episodes#ep624|Once a Ranger]]", teaming up with former Rangers including Bridge Carson from ''[[Power Rangers S.P.D.|S.P.D.]]''.

==Plot==
{{main|List of Power Rangers Mystic Force characters|List of Power Rangers Mystic Force episodes}}
200 years ago, in a magic-filled dimension parallel world, the forces of darkness came into power and a war called the "Great Battle" between good and evil began, unbeknownst to the citizens of the human world. An army of the monsters, led by a powerful warrior named Morticon, swarmed into the land with their sights set on taking over the magical realm, the human realm and beyond. In the midst, they combat five wizards, who pushed back against the dark forces. The strongest wizard of all, Leanbow, cast a spell and sent the evil warriors into the Underworld, having the Gatekeeper seal the gates for all eternity. The forces of truth successfully thwarted the dark forces' attempt to take the surface world, but they lost the five wizards, including Leanbow, who sealed himself on their side of the Gate to make sure the evil forces did not escape.

In the present day, the city of Briarwood was struck by an earthquake, which was just enough to crack the seal, allowing evil to renew its attempt to invade the earth. The sorceress Udonna, realizing that the forces of evil had returned, sought out the warriors of legend, five teens living in Briarwood, to become the Power Rangers alongside her. While one of the teens was reluctant at first, he realized his destiny and joined the others in the fight against the Master of the Underworld and his numerous minions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/ranger-station-halloween-special-the-stranger-within/|title=Ranger Station Halloween Special: The Stranger Within|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Udonna loses her Ranger powers to the mysterious Koragg, it is up to Nick, Chip, Xander and sisters Madison and Vida, to save the Earth on their own. They are assisted by Udonna's bumbling apprentice, Clare, and eventually Jenji the Genie and his master Daggeron, the Solaris Knight.

Using their powerful magic and incredible martial arts skills, the Mystic Force Power Rangers must rely on teamwork to save the day. Later, in a shocking surprise, it is revealed that Koragg is none other than Leanbow, the greatest and strongest of the five original wizards. The good power that was taken from Udonna helps Koragg turn back to his normal self, and he uses his powers to transform into the most powerful defender of truth, the Wolf Warrior. In the end, Leanbow and Daggeron are supposedly killed in a battle with the evil master and the rangers lose their magical powers for initially destroying the Evil Master's body. After this, Necrolai turns good and with the help of a good monster from Evil Master's team destroys the more powerful minion of the Master. She then revives Leanbow and Daggeron, sacrificing her powers in the process and turning into a normal woman. After that the people of Briarwood, and the creatures who live in the forest, join with the rangers and transfer their good faith to the rangers, thus returning them their power. The rangers then destroy the Master, after which Nick, Udonna and Leanbow leave Briarwood to meet Nick's adoptive parents. Nick gives Madison his red baby blanket to hold onto as a promise that he would return for her, implying that there ''could'' be a romantic relationship between them in the future.

[[File:Premiere at Chinese Theater (3555047236).jpg|thumb|300px|Film premiere for ''[[Flatliners]]'', [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], Hollywood, 1990]]
A '''premiere''' or '''première''' is the [[wikt:debut|debut]] (first public presentation) of a [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[film]], [[dance]], or [[musical composition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=premiere
 |title = Premiere

 |publisher = [[Princeton University]]
 |accessdate = 11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A work will often have many premières: a world première (the first time it is shown anywhere in the world) and its first presentation in each country. When a work originates in a country that speaks a different language from that in which it is receiving its national or international première, it is possible to have two premières for the same work in the same country—for example, the play ''[[The Maids]]'' by the French dramatist [[Jean Genet]] received its British première (which also happened to be its world première) in 1952, in a production given in the French language. Four years later, it was staged again, this time in English, which was its English-language première in Britain. 
==History==
Raymond F. Betts attributes the introduction of the film premiere to showman [[Sid Grauman]], who founded [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

{{Other uses|Premise (disambiguation)}}

The '''premise''' of a [[film]] or [[screenplay]] is the initial state of affairs that drives the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]].

Most premises can be expressed very simply, and many films can be identified simply from a short sentence describing the premise. For example: [[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|''A lonely boy is befriended by an alien'']]; [[Jaws (film)|''A small town is terrorized by a shark'']]; [[The Sixth Sense|''A small boy sees dead people'']].

[[File:Purim spiel 2009B.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Purim spiel performance in The Jewish Theatre of Warsaw, Poland in March 2009]]
A '''Purim spiel''' (also spelled ''Purimshpil'', {{etymology|yi|shpil|game, play}}, see also [[wikt:spiel|spiel]]) or '''Purim play''' is the term used to describe an ensemble of festive practices, usually a [[Comedy|comic]] [[Adaptation (arts)|dramatization]] of the [[Book of Esther]], the central text and narrative that describes what transpired on [[Purim]] and why it has become an important [[Jewish holiday]]. It may be an informal theatrical production, with costumed participants, often including children.

In modern use, a Purim Spiel is also the use of satire or humor in publishing a "fake" newspaper article, blog post, television news segment, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jr.co.il/humor/purim.htm&lt;/ref&gt; during the Hebrew month of [[Adar]].

By the 18th century in eastern [[Romania]] and some other parts of Eastern Europe, Purim plays (called ''Purimshpiln'', {{lang-yi|פּורימשפּילן}}) had evolved into broad-ranging satires with music and dance, precursors to [[Yiddish theater]], for which the story of Esther was little more than a pretext: indeed, by the mid-19th century, some were even based on other stories, such as [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] sold by his brothers, [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], or the [[Binding of Isaac]]. Since satire was deemed inappropriate for the synagogue itself, they were usually performed outdoors in its court. Purimspiels are still performed in many communities.  In France, Purim plays continue to be widely performed, particularly in active Ashkenazi communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

A favorite form of a Purim Spiel for children is enacted in [[puppet show]]s with the Purim characters and their antics making the children laugh.

The festival of Purim, which recalls the events of the Book of Esther, features characters whose identity, natures, or intent are "hidden."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.betemunah.org/esther.html#_Toc287475188&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, although the miraculous survival of the Persian Jews in the Book of Esther is due to God's intervention, God's name never appears in the Book of Esther.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.betemunah.org/esther.html#_Toc287475186&lt;/ref&gt; In the Book of Esther, the decree of the wicked [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] was annulled and the Jewish people living in the ancient [[Persian Empire]] were saved from the edict of death and genocide instigated against them by Haman.

[[Image:Shigin-small.JPG|thumb|right|Example ''gin'' with vocal annotation to the right of each character, Shān xíng, is poetry from Chinese poet [[Du Mu]] (9th century)]]

'''''Shigin''''' ({{Lang-ja|詩吟}}){{need-IPA}} is a performance of [[reciting]] a [[Japanese poetry|Japanese poem]] or a [[Chinese poetry|Chinese poem]] read in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], each poem ({{Lang-ja|詩}} = ''shi'') usually chanted ({{Lang-ja|吟}} = ''gin'') by an individual or in a group.  Reciting can be done loudly before a large audience, softly to a few friends, or quietly to the reciter himself or herself.

Each reciting is also termed ''gin''. Any forms of Japanese and Chinese poetry are used for reciting.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

[[Kanshi (poetry)|Kanshi]] and [[classical Chinese]] poems are usually composed of four or more lines of Chinese characters, or [[kanji]] (漢字), each line having the same number of characters.  ''Gin'' with four phrases, each seven characters long (the most common), are classified as {{Nihongo||七言絶句|[[shichigon-zekku]]|"seven-word [[quatrains]]"}}. There is strictly only one standard [[melody]], although many poems will be distinguished by minor variations from this theme.

==Performance==
Members of a shigin group will usually gather to train in a [[washitsu]], or Japanese-style room with [[tatami]] matting.  Participants kneel in the lotus or [[seiza]] position, thought to be the optimum posture to allow strong and steady projection during chanting.  They are encouraged to focus their energy in their gut (thought in [[Zen]] to be the locus of power) and sing by slowly expelling this energy.  Conversely, singing from the chest, as would be encouraged in classical Western [[opera]]tic style, is deemed unauthentic.

During practice, members may refer to the written ''gin'' to aid memory.  This is usually annotated, with marks to the right of each character denoting how the tone should vary through the length of its vocalisation.

Breathing intervals are indicated by [[right-angle|right-angular]] strokes to the left of the character (a typical ''gin'' will last approximately one and a half minutes, in four breaths).  Finally, because [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word orders differ, further (sino) numerical marks to the left of some characters indicate their correct sequence.

|}

''Gin'' are formally performed standing, and from [[memory]].  Because of this, recital of longer ''gin'' is sometimes seen as more accomplished (being harder to remember, and more likely to vary from the standard melodic form).  The vocal may be accompanied by traditional [[Japanese music|Japanese instruments]] such as the [[Koto (musical instrument)|Koto]] or [[Shakuhachi]].  Dress may be Western ([[Suit (clothes)|suit]]) or traditional ([[kimono]] or [[yukata]]).

''Gin'' are also used in the performance of certain Japanese dances, such as [[kenshibu]].  In such cases, ''gin'' may either be performed live or played from recordings.

== History ==
Shigin are thought to have originated in [[China]] early in the first millennium AD, and may have entered Japan amongst other texts brought back from China in the 5th century.  They were most likely sung originally in Chinese, but were later given Japanese readings, which are used in their contemporary recital.  New gin were written, often detailing particular Japanese concepts or events, but the standard written layout has remained.

Shigin are thus significantly older than other, more popular Japanese poetry forms, such as [[Haiku]].  Their practice is now a minority art, mostly confined to the elderly and little known amongst younger generations.  Nevertheless, several Shigin festivals are held throughout the year, including the Autumn Shigin Festival (秋吟会) in [[Shiogama, Miyagi|Shiogama]] and [[Shinjō, Yamagata|Shinjo]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.shinjo.yamagata.jp/2168.html 新庄詩吟祭り] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121219182859/http://www.city.shinjo.yamagata.jp/2168.html |date=2012-12-19 }} (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; in the North-East ([[Tōhoku Region|Tōhoku]]) region of Japan.  ''Gin'' are also sung at Buddhist ceremonies and quasi-religious gatherings in Japan.

Moreover, although largely in anonymity, Shigin continue to have a significant influence on [[Japanese culture]].  Individual poems are often studied in Japanese textbooks, and are regularly displayed at exhibitions of [[Japanese calligraphy]]. 

From 2013 onwards, a Japanese fusion band called [[Wagakki Band]] began to be active and quickly became popular nationwide and online. The band incorporates shigin, vocaloid, wagakki (traditional Japanese instruments) and rock elements and the vocalist, [[:ja:鈴華ゆう子|Suzuhana Yuuko]], is a shigin master and utilises shigin technique in performances with the ambition to raise interest among the youth and around the world. Some of their [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqwysRHT3RQ songs] contain a section of shigin.

==Examples==
The example below is a [[tanka]] about [[Mount Iwate]] by Japanese poet [[Takuboku Ishikawa]] (1886 – 1912, [[:ja:石川啄木#代表歌]]), with Japanese pronunciation shown in parentheses

{|

The second example is a [[Kanshi (poetry)|Kanshi poem]] by Japanese educator [[Tanso Hirose]] (1782 – 1856, [[:ja:広瀬淡窓#史跡]]), who encouraged his students to live together as well as study together at his institution in [[Kyushu]]:

[[File:Dartagnan-musketeers.jpg|right|thumb|[[D'Artagnan]] and the Three Musketeers.]]
A '''swashbuckler''' is a heroic [[archetype]] in European adventure literature that is typified by the use of a sword, acrobatics and chivalric ideals. The archetype also became common as a [[Swashbuckler film|film genre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Swashbuckler |title=Swashbuckler |quote=The swashbuckler is the most rigidly conventionalized of all the subgenres of the Adventure genre |publisher=[[TV Tropes]] |accessdate=March 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archetype==
A 'swashbuckler' is a protagonist who is heroic and idealistic: he rescues damsels in distress, defends the downtrodden, and in general saves the day. Swashbucklers are not unrepentant brigands or pirates, although some may rise from such disreputable stations in redemption.&lt;ref name=Richards&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vp4sAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP26&amp;dq=Swashbuckler&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VytUVa24MpeiyASls4GIBw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAjge#v=onepage&amp;q=Swashbuckler&amp;f=false Richards, Jeffrey. ''Swordsmen of the Screen'', Routledge, 2014] {{ISBN|9781317928638}}&lt;/ref&gt; His opponent is typically characterized as the dastardly villain. There is a long [[Swashbuckler#List of swashbucklers|list of swashbucklers]] who combine outstanding courage, [[swordfighting]] skill, resourcefulness, and a distinctive sense of honor and justice, as for example ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac]]'', ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'', [[Robin Hood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/rh/rhhome.htm|title= The Robin Hood Project at the University of Rochester|publisher=[[University of Rochester]]|work=[[Robin Hood Project]]|accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zorro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=35322|title= The University can lay claim to having its very own Zorro after a student won a prestigious national fencing competition|accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
"Swashbuckler" is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] of "swash" (archaic: to [[Swaggering|swagger]] with a drawn sword) and "[[buckler]]" (a small shield gripped in the fist) dating from the [[16th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=swashbuckler |title= swashbuckler - Origin and meaning of swashbuckler by Online Etymology Dictionary |author= |date= |website= www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hadesign.co.uk/SSA/html/buckler.htm |title= The Buckler |publisher= The Sussex Rapier School |access-date= 2007-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
[[File:Stevenson - The Black Arrow, 1933.djvu|thumb|R.L. Stevenson - ''The Black Arrow'']]

While [[man-at-arms]] and [[mercenary|sellswords]] of the era usually wore armor of necessity, their counterparts in later romantic literature and film (see below) often did not, and the term evolved to denote a daring, devil-may-care demeanor rather than brandishment of accoutrements of war, and modern "swashbuckling" heroes might not carry swords at all.

Swashbuckling adventures and romances are generally set in Europe from the late [[Renaissance]] up through the [[Age of Reason]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]], extending into the [[European colonization of the Americas|colonial era]] with [[Golden Age of Piracy|pirate]] tales in the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]].

===Literature===
[[Jeffrey Richards]] traces the swashbuckling novel to the rise of [[Romanticism]], and an outgrowth of the historical novel, particularly those of Sir [[Walter Scott]], "... medieval tales of chivalry, love and adventure rediscovered in the eighteenth century".&lt;ref name=Richards/&gt; This type of historical novel was further developed by [[Alexandre Dumas]].

[[John Galsworthy]] said of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s 1888 swashbuckling romance, ''[[The Black Arrow]]'', that it was "a livelier picture of medieval times than I remember elsewhere in fiction."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Edward Wagenknecht, ''Cavalcade of the English Novel'' (New York, 1943), 377&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Hope]]'s 1894, ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' initiated an additional subset of the swashbuckling novel, the [[Ruritanian romance]].&lt;ref&gt;Lancelyn Green, Roger. ''Introduction to Prisoner of Zenda &amp; Rupert of Hentzau'', Everyman's Library. J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre===
The perceived significant and widespread role of swordsmanship in civilian society as well as warfare in the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods led to fencing being performed on theatre stages as part of plays. Soon actors were taught to fence in an entertaining, dramatic manner. Eventually fencing became an established part of a classical formation for actors.

===Movie===
Consequently, when movie theaters mushroomed, ambitious actors took the chance to present their accordant skills on the screen. Since silent movies were no proper medium for long dialogues, the classic stories about heroes who would defend their honour with sword in hand were simplified and sheer action would gain priority. This was the birth of a new kind of film hero: the swashbuckler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.classicalfencing.com/articles/swash.php|title= At Sword's Point: Swashbuckling in the Movies|accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of the most famous instructors for swashbuckling swordplay are [[William Hobbs (choreographer)|William Hobbs]], [[Anthony De Longis]], [[Bob Anderson (fencer)|Bob Anderson]] and [[Peter Diamond (actor)|Peter Diamond]].

The larger-than-life heroics portrayed in some film franchise adventures (most notably the ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' movies) set in the modern era have been described as swashbuckling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/150514-indiana-jones-archaeology-exhibit-national-geographic-museum |title= How Indiana Jones Actually Changed Archaeology |author= |date= 14 May 2015 |website= nationalgeographic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
{{main article|Swashbuckler film}}

The genre has, apart from swordplay, always been characterized by influences that can be traced back to the [[chivalry]] tales of Medieval Europe, such as the legends of [[Robin Hood]] and [[King Arthur]]. It soon created its own drafts based on classic examples like [[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|''The Mark of Zorro'' (1920)]], ''[[The Three Musketeers (1921 film)|The Three Musketeers (1921)]]'', ''[[Scaramouche (1923 film)|Scaramouche (1923)]]'' and ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934 film)|The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934)]]''. Some films did also use [[motif (narrative)|motifs]] of pirate stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://dryden.eastmanhouse.org/uncategorized/2007/01/swordplay-and-sunken-treasures-the-great-swashbucklers-and-pirate-movies/|title= Swordplay and Sunken Treasures:The Great Swashbucklers and Pirate Movies|accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often these films were adaptations of classic historic novels published by well-known authors such as [[Alexandre Dumas]], [[Rafael Sabatini]], [[Baroness Emma Orczy]], Sir [[Walter Scott]], [[Johnston McCulley]], and [[Edmond Rostand]].
Swashbucklers are one of the most flamboyant Hollywood film genres,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://msfencing.org/swashbucklingfilms.html|title= 266 Swashbuckling Films |accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike [[cinema verite]] or modern realistic filmmaking. The genre attracted large audiences who relished the blend of escapist adventure, historic romance, and daring stunts in cinemas before it became a fixture on TV screens.

As a first variation of the classic swashbuckler there have also been female swashbucklers.&lt;ref name="eldacur.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.eldacur.com/~brons/Maupin/Maupin-Like.html|title= Swashbuckling Women of Movies, TV, Theatre, etc.|accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maureen O'Hara]] in ''[[Against All Flags]]'' and [[Jean Peters]] in ''[[Anne of the Indies]]'' were very early action film heroines.

Eventually the typical swashbuckler motifs were used up because they had so often been shown on TV screens. Later films such as ''[[The Princess Bride]]'', the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' series and ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]'' include modern takes on the swashbuckler archetype.

==Television==
Television followed the films, especially in the UK, with ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'', ''[[Sword of Freedom]]'', ''[[The Buccaneers (TV series)|The Buccaneers]]'', and ''[[William Tell (TV series)|Willam Tell]]'' between 1955 and 1960. US TV produced two series of ''[[Zorro]]'' in [[Zorro (1957 TV series)|1957]] and [[Zorro (1990 TV series)|1990]]. Following the 1998 film ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]'', a TV series about a female swashbuckler, the ''[[Queen of Swords (TV series)|Queen of Swords]]'', aired in 2000.&lt;ref name="eldacur.com"/&gt;

==Actors==
Actors notable for their portrayals of swashbucklers include:

* [[Benoît-Constant Coquelin]] (1841–1909), was a French [[actor]], and "one of the greatest theatrical figures of the age."&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/01/28/101733062.pdf" Elder Coquelin Dies of Acute Embolism; Great French Actor Was Soon to Appear in Rostand's "Chanticler.", ''New York Times''. January 28, 1909]&lt;/ref&gt; He played "Cyrano de Begerac" over 400 times and later toured North America in the role.
* In early 1883 [[James O'Neill (actor)#The Count of Monte Cristo|James O'Neill]] (1847–1920) took over the lead role in "The Count of Monte Cristo" at Booth's Theater in New York. His interpretation of the part caused a sensation with the theater-going public and a company was immediately set up to take the play on tour. O'Neill bought the rights to the play. "Monte Cristo" remained a popular favorite and would continue to make its appearance on tour as regular as clockwork. O'Neill went on to play this role over 6,000 times.
* E. H. Sothern (1859–1933) was especially known for his heroic portrayal of Rudolph Rassendyl in the first stage adaptation of ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'', which he first played in 1895.&lt;ref name=EAdnb&gt;Holder, Heidi J.

*[[Douglas Fairbanks]] (1883-1939) was a Hollywood movie star of the silent film era and was widely regarded as the predecessor to Errol Flynn.
*[[Errol Flynn]] (1909-1959) was famously known for the action adventurer typified Hollywood's idea of the swashbuckler in films as ''[[Captain Blood (1935 film)|Captain Blood]]'' (1935), ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938), and ''[[The Sea Hawk (1940 film)|The Sea Hawk]]'' (1940).
*[[Burt Lancaster]] (1913-1994) Although he was very much an all-round actor successful in any kind of role, two swashbuckling films where he was the lead were ''[[The Flame and the Arrow]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Crimson Pirate]]'' (1952).

Switchboard was founded in March 1974 as the '''London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard''', providing help and information to London's [[gay community]], particularly in the aftermath of the partial decriminalisation of male homosexuality in 1967.

In the 1980s, Switchboard was the leading source of information on [[HIV/AIDS]], with some of Switchboard's volunteers amongst the founding members of the [[Terrence Higgins Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tht.org.uk/our-charity/Our-work/Our-history/1980s|title=Terrence Higgins Trust in the 1980s {{!}} Terrence Higgins Trust|last=Trust|first=Terrence Higgins|website=www.tht.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2008, Switchboard was the recipient of the [[Queen's Award for Voluntary Service]]. The organisation was invited and accepted to go to [[Buckingham Palace]] to collect the award. In 2014, [[Queen Elizabeth II]] acknowledged the 40th anniversary of the organisation's founding, marking the first time she has had any involvement, voiced support or recognised an [[LGBT]] charity during her reign, and the first time the Crown has ever publicly supported the LGBT community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hear, Hear!

Switchboard rebranded to its current name in 2015 to emphasize inclusion for persons of all sexual orientation and gender identities, and that its services are not limited to London.&lt;ref name="llgs to switchboard" /&gt;

Today, it has expanded considerably to more than 30,000 callers each year, and now also provides support through email and instant messaging. Switchboard provides a listening service for people to discuss their feelings in an impartial and non-judgmental way, as well as information and advice for going out in London and the UK. Switchboard also operates an internet database of LGBT+ organisations in the UK known as "queery".

'''''VVVVVV''''' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Platform video game#Puzzle platformers|puzzle platform]] [[video game]] created by [[Terry Cavanagh (developer)|Terry Cavanagh]].  The game was built in [[Adobe Flash]] and released on January 11, 2010, for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[OS X]]. The game was [[Porting|ported]] to [[C++]] by Simon Roth in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12kqw6/im_simon_roth_creator_of_scifi_godgame_maia_ama/ im_simon_roth_creator_of_scifi_godgame_maia_ama] by Simon Roth on reddit.com&lt;/ref&gt; and released as part of the [[Humble Indie Bundle|Humble Indie Bundle #3]]. The port to C++ allowed the porting of the game to other platforms as [[Linux]], [[Pandora (handheld)|Pandora]], [[Nintendo 3DS]] and [[Nintendo Switch]].

== Gameplay ==
[[File:VVVVVV - The Tomb of Mad Carew.png|thumb|left|In this room, Captain Viridian must avoid the red spikes and green ghost. The "C" icon to the left of the spike pit is a checkpoint, which the player is returned to upon dying.]]

Unlike most [[Platform video game|platforming]] games, in ''VVVVVV'' the player is not able to jump, but instead can reverse the direction of gravity when standing on a surface, causing Captain Viridian to fall either upwards or downwards.&lt;ref name="kotaku-review" /&gt;  This feature was first seen in the 1986 [[8-bit]] game [[Terminus (1986 video game)|Terminus]]. The player uses this mechanic to traverse the game's environment and avoid various hazards, including stationary spikes and moving enemies.

Later areas introduce new mechanics such as moving floors or rooms which, upon touching one edge of the screen, [[wraparound (video games)|cause the player character to appear on the other side]].&lt;ref name="indiegames-review" /&gt;  ''VVVVVV'' contains eight main [[Level (video gaming)|levels]], including two intermissions, and one final level, only seen outside Dimension VVVVVV (in a "polar dimension"), situated inside a larger open world for the player to explore.&lt;ref name="rps-review" /&gt;  Due to its high level of difficulty, the game world contains many checkpoints, to which the player's character is reset upon death.

The sad elephant, sometimes also called the elephant in the room, is a large elephant with a tear dropping from its eye. It spans four rooms near the Space Station area of Dimension VVVVVV, flickering constantly from color to color. If the player stands near the elephant for a short period of time, it will cause Captain Viridian to become sad. The elephant serves no function to the game, but has served to provoke much discussion about its meaning or symbolism amongst fans of the game. Similarly to many of the enemies in the game, the sad elephant originated in dream journals kept by creator Terry Cavanagh and not from [[Jet Set Willy]] as once believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vvvvvv-wiki.wikispaces.com/Curiosities |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214231154/http://vvvvvv-wiki.wikispaces.com/Curiosities |archivedate=2014-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
[[File:Sad Elephant room in the game vvvvvv.jpg|thumb|right|The Sad Elephant near Space Station 2]]

The player controls Captain Viridian, who at the outset of ''VVVVVV'' must evacuate the spaceship along with the captain's crew, when the ship becomes affected by "dimensional interference".  The crew escapes through a [[Teleportation|teleporter]] on the ship; however, Captain Viridian becomes separated from the rest of the crew on the other end of the teleporter.  Upon returning to the ship, the Captain learns that the ship is trapped in an alternative dimension (referred to as ''Dimension VVVVVV''), and that the ship's crew has been scattered throughout this dimension. The player's goal, as Captain Viridian, is to rescue the missing crew members and find the cause of the dimensional interference.&lt;ref name="eurogamer-review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/vvvvvv-review |title=''VVVVVV Review'' |first=Oli |last=Welsh |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2010-01-21 |accessdate=2011-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The gravity-flipping mechanic of ''VVVVVV'' is based on an earlier game designed by Cavanagh, entitled ''Sine Wave Ninja''.  In an interview with IndieGames.com, Cavanagh said that he was interested in using this idea as a core concept of a game, something he felt other games which include a gravity-flipping mechanism had never done before.&lt;ref name="indiegames"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2010/01/intervvvvvview_terry_cavanagh.html |title=Intervvvvvview: Terry Cavanagh |first=Michael |last=Rose |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2010-12-01 |publisher=IndieGames.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavanagh first unveiled ''VVVVVV'' on his blog in June 2009.  The game had been in development for two weeks, and Cavanagh estimated that the game would be finished in another two, "but hopefully not much longer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://distractionware.com/blog/?p=858 |title=VVVVVVVV Preview |first=Terry |last=Cavanagh |date=2009-06-10 |publisher=Distractionware |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A follow-up post published in July 2009 included screenshots of the game and an explanation of the game's gravity-flipping mechanic.  Cavanagh wrote that ''VVVVVV'', unlike some of his previous work such as ''Judith'' and ''Pathways'', would not be a "storytelling experiment", but rather "focused on the level design".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://distractionware.com/blog/?p=885 |title=When It's Done |first=Terry |last=Cavanagh |date=2009-07-15 |publisher=Distractionware |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game was first shown publicly at the 2009 [[Eurogamer Expo]], which gave Cavanagh the opportunity to collect feedback from players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://distractionware.com/blog/?p=1019 |title=Eurogamer Expo 2009 |first=Terry |last=Cavanagh |date=2009-11-05 |publisher=Distractionware |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2009, a beta version of ''VVVVVV'' which had been given to donors was [[Internet leak|leaked]] on [[4chan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://distractionware.com/blog/?p=1044 |title=Final Push |first=Terry |last=Cavanagh |date=2009-12-07 |publisher=Distractionware |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual style of ''VVVVVV'' is heavily inspired by games released for the [[Commodore 64]] 8-bit computer from the 1980s, especially ''[[Jet Set Willy]]'' which is referenced by the element of collecting difficult-to-reach shiny objects and most notably the naming of each room; Cavanagh aimed to create a game "that looked and felt like the C64 games I grew up with." He eventually entrusted naming the rooms to ''[[QWOP]]'' developer [[Bennett Foddy]], who created every room name in the final version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://distractionware.com/blog/2010/01/down-under/ |title=Down Under |first=Terry |last=Cavanagh |date=2010-08-01 |publisher=Distractionware |accessdate=2013-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The graphical style of ''VVVVVV'' is heavily influenced by the [[Commodore 64]]; similarly, the game's music is heavily dependent on [[chiptune]] elements. Swedish composer Magnus Pålsson scored the game, and released the original soundtrack in 2010, titled ''PPPPPP''.

Cavanagh also considered this game an opportunity to indulge in his "retro fetish".  He has said because he lacks the technical prowess to make more modern-looking games, he instead focuses on making them visually interesting; additionally, he finds this to be made easier by "work[ing] within narrow limits".&lt;ref name="indiegames" /&gt; ''VVVVVV'' was the first game which Cavanagh sold commercially.  While his previous games were all released as freeware, due to the size of ''VVVVVV'' compared to his previous work, Cavanagh felt that he "couldn't see [himself] going down that route."&lt;ref name="indiegames" /&gt;

''VVVVVV'' was released on January 11, 2010 for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]]. A [[trial version]] of the game is playable on the website [[Kongregate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kongregate.com/games/TerryCavanagh/vvvvvv-demo |title=VVVVVV Demo |publisher=[[Kongregate]] |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Linux]] version was in development, but a number of technical difficulties arose in the [[Software port|porting]] process, which led Cavanagh to cancel it for the time being.

The game was rewritten in C++ by games developer Simon Roth in 2011, allowing Linux support to be successfully implemented. This formed version 2.0 of ''VVVVVV'', launched on July 24, 2011 as part of the third [[Humble Indie Bundle]]. Version 2.0 also features support for custom levels, and a level editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VVVVVV v2|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/07/26/vvvvvv-v2-0-now-with-added-notch|first=Lewie|last=Procter|date=2011-08-01 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The C++ port also allowed for the implementation of new graphics modes and various speed improvements. Version 2.0, however, does not support saved games from the original Flash version of ''VVVVVV''; many players received this update via Steam without warning, and hence were unable to continue their existing saved games. A save-file exporter is in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VVVVVV Tech Support|url=http://distractionware.com/forum/index.php?topic=361.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on this [[source code]] it was also ported in 2011 for the [[Open Pandora]],{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} which requires the data files from the [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] or [[Linux]] version of the game to work.

On October 7, 2011, it was announced that a version of the game was being made for [[Nintendo 3DS]] by Nicalis. It was released on December 29, 2011 in North America and May 10, 2012 in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5847456/vvvvvv-coming-soon-to-nintendo-3ds/ |title=VVVVVV Coming Soon to Nintendo 3DS |publisher=Kotaku.com |date=2011-10-06 |accessdate=2013-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nintendo 3DS version was eventually released in Japan on October 12, 2016, courtesy of Japanese publisher Pikii.&lt;ref&gt;https://topics.nintendo.co.jp/c/article/b6bbb7b9-8b87-11e6-9b38-063b7ac45a6d.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a demo of the game's early levels was ported to the Commodore 64 by programmer Paul Koller, with Cavanagh's assistance.&lt;ref name=c64&gt;{{cite news |last1=Webster |first1=Andrew |title=One man's quest to bring your favorite indie games to the Commodore 64 |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/26/3693208/c64-indie-games-paul-koller |accessdate=14 August 2018 |work=The Verge |date=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017 a complete port to the Commodore 64 was released by developer Laxity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=VVVVVV + - Incredible news as modern Indie game gets a C64 conversion! |url=http://www.indieretronews.com/2017/04/vvvvvv-incredible-news-as-modern-indie.html |accessdate=14 August 2018 |work=www.indieretronews.com |date=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soundtrack ===
The soundtrack of ''VVVVVV'' was composed by [[chiptune]] musician Magnus Pålsson (also known as SoulEye). Cavanagh approached Pålsson to compose ''VVVVVV'' after playing ''Space Phallus'', an indie game by Charlie's Games, which featured a song by him.  Pålsson wrote on the Distractionware blog that, upon playing Cavanagh's previous games, he was "amazed at the depth that came with the games, even though they were small and short."  In writing the music for ''VVVVVV'', Pålsson aimed to make "uptempo happy songs that would ingrain themselves into your minds whether you want to or not, hopefully so much so that you’d go humming on them when not playing, and making you want to come back to the game even more."&lt;ref name="pppppp-blog"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://distractionware.com/blog/?p=1131| title=Select Track| first=Magnus| last=Pålsson| date=2010-01-07|publisher=Distractionware |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The complete soundtrack, titled ''PPPPPP'', was released alongside ''VVVVVV'' and is sold as a [[music download]] or [[CD]] on Pålsson's personal website.&lt;ref name="pppppp-site"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.souleye.se/ |first=Magnus |last=Pålsson |title=Souleye - Digital Music |accessdate=2011-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 12, 2014 Pålsson released a [[power metal]] version of the soundtrack titled ''MMMMMM'' which was arranged and performed by guitarist Jules Conroy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pålsson|first1=Magnus|title=\M/ \M/ \M/ \M/ \M/ \M/|url=http://www.souleye.se/m|website=SoulEye|accessdate=June 15, 2014|date=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The album contains a mod file to replace the in-game music with the metal tracks.

''VVVVVV'' has been generally well received by critics, earning a score of 81/100 for the Windows version and 83/100 for the 3DS version on [[review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]].{{r|MCPC|MC3DS}} The game was noted for being the first important independent release of 2010;&lt;ref name="indiegames-review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2010/01/review_vvvvvv_terry_cavanagh.html |title=Review: ''VVVVVV'' (Terry Cavanagh) |first=Michael |last=Rose |date=2010-01-11 |publisher=IndieGames.com |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rps-review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/01/12/wot-i-think-vvvvvv/ |title=Wot I Think: ''VVVVVV'' |first=Kieron |last=Gillen |date=2010-01-12 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kieron Gillen]] of ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'' called it "the first great Indie game of the year",&lt;ref name="rps-review" /&gt; while Michael Rose, writing for IndieGames.com, noted that the release of ''VVVVVV'' followed a year which "some may argue...didn't really deliver an outstanding indie title which showed the mainstream that independent developers mean business."&lt;ref name="indiegames-review" /&gt;  The level design of ''VVVVVV'' was lauded by critics:&lt;ref name="kotaku-review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="indiegames-review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="edge-review" /&gt; Rose considered the game to have no filler content, which he found to be "one of the game's strongest points".&lt;ref name="indiegames-review" /&gt;  Michael McWhertor of gaming news blog [[Kotaku]] wrote that the game's areas contained "a surprising amount of variation throughout...ensuring that ''VVVVVV'' never feels like its designer failed to explore the gameplay possibilities."&lt;ref name="kotaku-review" /&gt;

Most reviewers wrote of ''VVVVVV''{{'s}} high level of difficulty.&lt;ref name="kotaku-review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5449094/vvvvvv-micro+review-aaaaaah |title=''VVVVVV'' Micro-review: AAAAAAH!!! |first=Michael |last=McWhertor |date=2010-01-15 |publisher=Kotaku |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ign-review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/106/1068331p1.html |title=''VVVVVV'' Review |first=Samuel |last=Claiborn |date=2010-02-10 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamesradar-review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/pc/vvvvvv/review/vvvvvv/a-2010020917176168008/g-20100209171039153060 |title=''VVVVVV'' Review |first=Jaz |last=McDougall |date=2010-02-11 |publisher=[[GamesRadar]] |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="edge-review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/reviews/review-vvvvvv |title=Review: VVVVVV |author=''Edge'' Staff |publisher=''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' |date=2010-01-08 |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  McWhertor found that "the game's trial and error moments can seriously test one's patience."&lt;ref name="kotaku-review" /&gt;  However, several critics noted that the game's challenge is made less frustrating due to its numerous checkpoints, as well as the player's ability to retry after dying as many times as needed.&lt;ref name="ign-review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="edge-review" /&gt;  These additions made ''VVVVVV'' "not unforgiving", according to [[IGN]] staff writer Samuel Claiborn, while still being "old-school in its demands of player dedication".&lt;ref name="ign-review" /&gt; Independent reviewer Declan Tyson said that he feels "victimised by the game's criminally unforgiving collision detection and over-enthusiastically sensitive controls" but that "it's all worth it for when you reach the next checkpoint and feel that split second of relief".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://declantyson.net/BlogRead.aspx?id=87&amp;catid=2 |title=Declan Tyson ''VVVVVV'' review |accessdate=2012-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707112246/http://declantyson.net/BlogRead.aspx?id=87&amp;catid=2 |archivedate=2012-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The price of ''VVVVVV'' when it was originally released was $15.  This was seen by McWhertor as being the game's "one unfortunate barrier" to entry: "While there's plenty to see and do after blazing through the game's core campaign, the steeper than expected asking price will probably turn some off."&lt;ref name="kotaku-review" /&gt;  Likewise, Gillen wrote in his review that the cost "does strike you as a lot for an Indie lo-fi platformer", while insisting that "it is worth the money".&lt;ref name="rps-review" /&gt;  Since its original release, the price of ''VVVVVV'' has been reduced to $5.  On his blog, Cavanagh said that the decision was difficult to make, but added, "I know that the original price of $15 was off putting for a lot of people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://distractionware.com/blog/?p=1440 |title=Positive Force |first=Terry |last=Cavanagh |date=2010-09-08 |publisher=Distractionware |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nintendo 3DS homebrew exploit ==
On May 1, 2016, ShinyQuagsire discovered that the [[Nintendo 3DS]] port of ''VVVVVV'' can be exploited to load [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] software.

'''Yoarashi Okinu''' (夜嵐 おきぬ, [[Circa|ca.]]1845&lt;ref Name="atsusi"&gt;{{cite web | author= [[Atsushi Hachisu]]| script-title=ja:歴史的女景 夜嵐お絹 | publisher= | language=Japanese | url=http://www.h4.dion.ne.jp/~okino/kaikyou/jokei.htm |date=March 1994 | accessdate=2007-11-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070816125427/http://www.h4.dion.ne.jp/~okino/kaikyou/jokei.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; – March 28, 1872) is the [[moniker]] of {{nihongo|'''Harada Kinu'''|原田 きぬ|}}, who was a Japanese female poisoner and [[geisha]] and lived from the end of the [[Edo era]] to the beginning of the [[Meiji era]]. Her nickname ''Yoarashi'' means night-storm in Japanese.

== Biography ==
Her early life is generally undocumented and has produced many ideas and opinion.  Some sources assert that she was a daughter of a [[samurai]] of [[Awa Province (Chiba)|Awa Province]], or she was born in [[Edo]]. There is another opinion that she was a daughter of Sajiro, a fisherman who lived on the island of Jōgashima at the tip of the [[Miura Peninsula]].  According to a non-fiction writer [[Atsushi Hachisu]], she sold herself into [[geisha]] because her family was poor, and she worked as a geisha.&lt;ref Name="atsusi" /&gt; There is another opinion that she was an employee at the decorative collar shop in the Nakamise neighborhood in front of [[Sensō-ji]].

As she was beautiful, people in the Edo longed for her. She became a [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] of Ōkubo Tadayori ([[:ja:大久保忠順|大久保忠順]]) in the capital [[Edo]].&lt;ref Name="atsusi" /&gt; He was the ''[[daimyō]]'' of the [[Karasuyama Domain]] in [[Shimotsuke Province]], which was rated at thirty thousand ''[[koku]]''. Ōkubo had a son, the successor to the Ōkubo family, by her. However, he hated her, and abandoned her in the [[Meiji Restoration]].&lt;ref name="atsusi" /&gt;

She became a mistress of Kobayashi Kinpei, but she paid for sex with kabuki actor Arashi Rikaku, and then fell in love with him, so she killed Kobayashi with poison on March 2, 1871. Rikaku harbored her but they were arrested. She was sentenced to death, and she was executed by [[decapitation]] after she had a child by Rikaku.

Rikaku was sentenced to 3 years in prison, and he was released in September 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Kido Okamoto]] | script-title=ja:明治演劇年表 | publisher= | language=Japanese | url=http://hansichi.hp.infoseek.co.jp/contents/meijiengekisi.html | date= | accessdate=2007-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became kabuki actor [[Ichikawa Gonjūrō]] after his release.

==Fictional story==

Her case was reported sensationally several years after that, but many researchers such as a Japanese art historian [[Naoyuki Kinoshita]] agree that [[mass media]] adapted her and there were untruths in her tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Naoyuki Kinoshita]] | script-title=ja:小野秀雄コレクション再考 | publisher=[[University of Tokyo]] | language=Japanese | url=http://www.um.u-tokyo.ac.jp/publish_db/1999news/01/0102.html | year=1999 | accessdate=2007-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, she was called a serial killer Yoarashi Okinu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Yumi Hirata | script-title=ja:"毒婦"の誕生 | publisher=[[University of Tokyo]] | language=Japanese | url=http://www.um.u-tokyo.ac.jp/publish_db/1999news/04/405/0405.html | year=1999 | accessdate=2007-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book {{nihongo|''Night-storm Okinu: Flower-Frail Dreams of Revenge''|夜嵐阿衣花廼仇夢|Yoarashi Okinu Hana-no-adayume}} characterized her as a she-devil, and her tradition is based on this virtual fiction.

===Real life differences===
*She lost her parents when she was 16 years old, and then she was accepted into her uncle's family as a foster child, living in Edo. There she became a geisha in the restaurant Owari-ya. She gave out as Kamakura Koharu.
*She met not Okubo Tadayori, but Okubo "Sado-no-Kami (defender in [[Sado Province|Sado]])" (his name was unwritten).
*She had a son Haruwaka-gimi, in "1857" (At that time, she was about "12 years old". It was Okubo Tadayori's birth year).
*In those days the woman of low social class couldn't marry a nobleman. Fictional story claimed that Kurosawa Gentatsu, a physician who lived in [[Nihonbashi]], became her foster parent, the middle-class family. She changed her name to Hanayo and became a concubine (In fact she was a mistress).
*When her son was three years old, her husband died (Okubo Tadayori died in 1914. His father died in 1864).
*After his death she changed her name to Shingetsu-in. She became a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] nun, and lived a calm life to pray for her dead husband followed the Japanese custom which is that a widow of high status entered nunhood after her husband died. She felt run-down in this life and went to [[Hakone, Kanagawa|Hakone]]. She fell in love with another man Kakutarō. She was exiled from the Okubo family (In fact, the Okubo family abandoned her, because Okubo Tadayori had a son by her).
*A part of her dying word was "Yoarashi" so she was called Yoarashi Okinu (unproved claim).
