The '''1907 Romanian Peasants' revolt''' took place between 21 February and 5 April 1907. It started in northern [[Moldavia]] and, after three weeks in which it was localized in that area, it quickly spread, reaching [[Wallachia]], including as far as [[Oltenia]]. The main cause was discontent of the peasants about the inequity of land ownership, which was in the hands of just a few large landowners.

Following the fall of the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]] government on March 12, the new [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|Liberal]] government crushed the revolt violently with the help of the Romanian Army, killing thousands of peasants in the process.

== Background ==

The 1864 land reforms gave the peasants full ownership rights for part of the land for which they previously had only the right to use.&lt;ref name="Eidelberg80"&gt;Eidelberg, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; However, the peasants remained even after these reforms dependent on the local landlords.&lt;ref name="Eidelberg80"/&gt; Additionally, the peasant population was rising fast, leading to rapidly shrinking properties: from an average family property of 3.42 hectares in 1896 down to 3.27 ha in 1905 and 3.06 ha in 1907.&lt;ref name="Eidelberg81"&gt;Eidelberg, p.81&lt;/ref&gt; The state was also a big landholder, however, its policies for selling the land often did not favor poorer peasants, who were in the greatest need for land.&lt;ref name="Eidelberg80"/&gt;

Needing to supplement their shrinking properties, the peasants were forced to use land owned by the landlords, who owned large estates.&lt;ref name="Eidelberg82"&gt;Eidelberg, p.82&lt;/ref&gt; As population grew, the peasants became more and more desperate for land, leading to rapidly rising rents.&lt;ref name="Eidelberg82"/&gt; At that time, peasants formed up to 80%  of the [[Romanians|Romanian]] population and about 60% of them owned small crops, or no land at all, while the large landowners owned more than half of the [[arable land]].

The [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]]'s policy to encourage peasant cooperatives was not successful, as many landlords feared the organization of the peasants, preferring to lease to individual peasants rather than to cooperatives. According to [[Ion Lahovari]], the Conservative Minister of Domains, a landlord could drive out a peasant refusing to pay his rent, but noted that for driving out a cooperative of 500 peasants, a regiment would be needed and the government may refuse to put it at the landlord's disposal.&lt;ref&gt;Eidelberg, p.84&lt;/ref&gt; As such, by the end of 1907, there were only 103 village cooperatives having a membership of 11,118 leasing 37,344 hectares, most of it leased from the state.&lt;ref&gt;Eidelberg, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, most large landowners preferred to live in the cities and did not want to bother with the administration of their properties. Therefore, the peasants no longer leased directly from the landowner, but sub-leased it from an intermediary lessor (''arendaș'').&lt;ref name="Eidelberg82"/&gt; The fall of the price of grain on the world markets meant that the lessors would demand ever greater rents in order to make ends meet.&lt;ref name="Eidelberg82"/&gt;

The blame for the revolt was initially put on Jewish intermediaries, given that many of the lessors were of Jewish background, especially in Northern Moldavia. The revolt quickly spread southward, losing some of its anti-Semitic character and becoming basically a protest against the existing system of land tenure.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Chirot, Charles Ragin, ''The Market, Tradition and Peasant Rebellion: The Case of Romania in 1907''. American Sociological Association, 1975, Vol. 40, No. 4, pp. 428-444.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Course of events ==
 {{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
[[File:A cavalry patrol watching the burning of farmhouses by the rioters near Bujeu.jpg|thumb|left|A cavalry patrol watching the burning of farmhouses by the rioters near Bujeu.]]
The revolt began on the lands administered by one lessor, Mochi Fischer, in the village of [[Flămânzi]] due to Fischer's refusal to renew the leases of the local peasants. The Austrian-Jewish family of Fischer used to lease about 75% of the arable land in three Romanian counties in Moldavia (the so-called "Fischerland").

The peasants, fearing that they would remain without work and, more importantly, without food, began to act violently. Scared, Fischer fled to a friend in [[Chernivtsy|Cernăuți]], leaving the peasants without signed contracts. The fear of remaining out of work, combined with the activities of alleged [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] instigators, led the peasants to revolt. The revolt soon spread across most of Moldavia, with several landowners' properties destroyed and many lessors killed or wounded. The Conservative government (''[[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880-1918)|Partidul Conservator]]'') couldn't handle the situation and resigned, and the Liberals (''[[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|Partidul Național-Liberal]]'') of [[Dimitrie Sturdza]] assumed power.

On 18 March a [[state of emergency]] was declared, and then a [[general mobilization]], with 140,000 soldiers being recruited by 29 March. The [[Romanian Army]] began firing on the peasants; thousands of peasants perished and more than 10,000 were arrested.

== Casualties ==

=== Peasants ===
[[File:A vedette waiting on the highway at Braila for an expected outrage by the peasants.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Vedette (sentry)|vedette]] waiting on the highway at [[Brăila]] for an expected attack by peasants.]]
The exact number of peasant deaths is unknown, and even the course of events are not clear, because the government, to hide the size of the massacre, ordered the destruction of all documents relating to the uprising.

Historian Markus Bauer mentions a greatly underestimated official figure of 419 deaths,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cultural.bzi.ro/cauzele-si-originea-rascoalei-taranesti-din-1907-7515|title = Cauzele și originea răscoalei țărănești din 1907|date = 2 December 2013|accessdate = |website = Bună Ziua Iași|publisher = |last = |first = |language = Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; while an unofficial figure, circulated by the press and widely accepted, of about 10,000 peasants killed, has never been proven to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The historical decline of fertility in Eastern Europe|last = Leasure|first = J. William|publisher = European Journal of Population|date = 6 January 1992|isbn = |location = |pages = 47–75|url = https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20164602?sid=21105873827143&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=2|volume = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://jurnalul.ro/campaniile-jurnalul/un-secol-de-flamanzi/1907-2007-revolta-fara-conducatori-din-regatul-romaniei-2140.html|title = 1907-2007: Revolta fără conducători din Regatul României|date = 14 February 2007|accessdate = |website = Jurnalul Național|publisher = |last = Betea|first = Lavinia|language = Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same figure of 419 deaths was mentioned by [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]] in the [[Romanian Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ziare.com/cultura/documentar/rascoale-romanesti-rascoala-de-la-flamanzi-1907-1043318|title = Răscoale românești: Răscoala de la Flămânzi - 1907|date = 25 September 2010|accessdate = |website = Ziare.com|publisher = |last = Dologa|first = Laurențiu|language = Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data available to the Prime Minister [[Dimitrie Sturdza]] indicated 421 deaths between 28 March and 5 April 1907. Likewise, about 112 were injured and 1,751 detained. Newspapers patronized by Constantin Mille, ''[[Adevărul]]'' and ''Dimineața'', gave a figure of 12,000-13,000 victims. In a conversation with the [[United Kingdom|British]] ambassador in [[Bucharest]], [[Carol I of Romania|King Carol I]] mentioned a figure of "several thousand".

According to figures given by Austrian diplomats, between 3,000-5,000 peasants were killed, while the French Embassy mentioned a death toll ranging between 10,000-20,000. Historians put the figures between 3,000-18,000, the most common being 11,000 victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Market, Tradition and Peasant Rebellion: The Case of Romania in 1907|last = Chirot|first = Daniel|publisher = American Sociological Review|year = August 1975|isbn = |location = |pages = 428–444|url = https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2094430?sid=21105873827143&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=2|last2 = Ragin|first2 = Charles|volume = 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Rumanian Peasant Revolt of 1907: Origins of a Modern Jacquerie|last = Eidelberg|first = Philip Gabriel|publisher =Studies of the Institute on East Central Europe at Columbia University |year = 1974|isbn = 90-04-03781-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Army ===
Only ten members of the Army were killed in the revolt: an officer, Lt. I. Nițulescu, killed in Stănești, two sergeants and seven soldiers. Four others were injured: an officer, Capt. Grigore Mareș, also wounded in Stănești, two sergeants and a soldier. Seventy-five soldiers of the Fifth Dorobanți Regiment ("Vlașca") appeared before military courts and charged with revolt; 61 were sentenced to hard labor for life and 14 to five years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/actualitate/articol/armata-rascoala-1907-care-este-cifra-reala-celor-ucisi|title = Armata și răscoala din 1907. Care este cifra reală a celor uciși?|date = 13 January 2011|accessdate = |website = Historia.ro|publisher = |last = Sperlea|first = Florin|language = Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Many intellectuals, among them [[Nicolae Iorga]], [[Alexandru Vlahuță]], [[Ion L. Caragiale]], [[Constantin Stere]], [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]] and [[Radu Rosetti]], protested against the violent intervention of the forces of repression. Others emphasized that the government had a special responsibility for the fate of the peasantry and the country in general, and therefore an urgent solution to the "peasant question" was required.

The Liberal government began a campaign to repress any kind of political organization of the peasants.&lt;ref name="Hitchins126"&gt;Hitchins, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Many teachers, priests and other countryside intellectuals were arrested, as were pro-[[universal suffrage]] activists [[Vasile M. Kogălniceanu]] and Alexandru Vălescu, who were regarded as instigators of the revolt.&lt;ref name="Hitchins126"/&gt;

The government also began enacting a series of reforms in order to provide some relief to the peasantry, but without expropriating the landlords.&lt;ref name="Hitchins179"&gt;Hitchins, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; The December 23, 1907 law on agricultural contracts limited the degree to which the peasants could be exploited by the landlords and lessors: it set maximum prices for land leases, it set minimum wages for peasants working on landlords' estates and it established ''[[Casa Rurală]]'', a bank which was supposed to help peasants to buy lots of 5 hectares from landlords.&lt;ref name="Hitchins179"/&gt; A law passed on April 12, 1908 banned anyone leasing more than 4000 hectares at one time.&lt;ref name="Hitchins180"&gt;Hitchins, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Octav Bancila - 1907.jpg|thumb|Octav Băncilă's iconic "1907" painting]]

== Legacy ==
The events continued to resonate in the Romanian conscience, and were the subject of one of the best novels of the interwar period, ''Răscoala'' ("The Revolt"), by [[Liviu Rebreanu]], published in 1932. A film based on the book, [[Răscoala]], was produced in 1965. The revolt also formed the subject of a painting by [[Octav Băncilă]], and of a monumental statue which can still be seen in Bucharest.

The '''2010 Hong Kong electoral reform''' was the series of events began in 2009 and finalised in 2010 under the '''''Consultation Document on the Methods for Selecting the Chief executive and for Forming the LegCo in 2012''''', a document published on 18 November 2009 by the [[Government of Hong Kong]], ostensibly to broaden the scope of political participation and increase the democratic elements in the 2012 elections in line with the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]].

The proposals included modifying the arrangements for electing the [[Chief executive of Hong Kong]] and the composition and ways of electing the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|city's legislature]] in 2012, in line with the December 2007 decision of the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC). While the [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pan-democracy camp]] attacked the conservative proposals as a rehash of those already rejected in 2005, the government said its proposals were "more democratic", and could not exceed what was authorised by Beijing.

The consultations took place in the backdrop of talks about a ''de facto'' referendum, and the [[Hong Kong by-election, 2010]] precipitated by the resignation of five pan-democrat legislators in January 2010. Official attempts to secure the passage of the proposals resulted in a media campaign by the city's leaders and an unprecedented televised debate between the Chief executive and a leader of an opposition party; it also resulted in renewing of dialogue between Beijing and the Pan-democrats which ceased after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].

Following the Central Government's acceptance at the eleventh hour of a proposal by the Democratic Party concerning the new District Council functional constituency seats which they had up to that point opposed as being in contravention of the Basic Law, the consultation package was accepted by LegCo on 25 June, with 46 votes. The pan-democrat camp was split when the Democratic Party voted with the government amidst severe recriminations and protests of betrayal; the [[League of Social Democrats]] and the [[Civic Party]] remained opposed to the package but were unable to block the passage. The Chief executive assented on 29 June 2010, and China's parliament ratified the decision on 28 August.

==Background==

=== Pan-democrats' blueprint ===
In March 2007, the pan-democrats published their own blueprint, the 'mainstream transitional proposal' drawn up with the support of 21 legislators in accordance with principles of equal and universal suffrage and which they said reflected public opinion. They proposed that 400 elected district councillors would join the existing 800-member [[Election Committee]], making a total of 1,200-members; Nominations threshold would be set at 50 EC members, and the candidate for CE would be elected in a one-person, one-vote election. Ultimately, the nomination committee would be scrapped. For the legislature, they propose returning half Legco's seats by direct election in single-seat constituencies, with the other half determined by proportional representation.&lt;ref&gt;Leung, Ambrose; Hung, Denise &amp; Lee, Klaudia (3 March 2007) "Democrats agree on suffrage road map", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chief executive's report===
During his campaign in the CE election in 2007, [[Donald Tsang]] promised that he would "endeavour to forge consensus within the community within his new term, so that universal suffrage could be implemented as soon as possible." A [[Green Paper on Constitutional Development]] was published on 11 July to open discussion on the options, roadmap and timetable for implementing universal suffrage for the CE and the LegCo. According to the consultation document, the CE submitted a report to the NPCSC on 12 December 2007, that "reflect[ed] faithfully the views of different sectors of the community on the issue of universal suffrage received during the public consultation period." The government document asserted that "more than half of the public supported the implementation of universal suffrage for the CE and the LegCo ('dual universal suffrage') in 2012, and at the same time, implementing universal suffrage for the CE first by no later than 2017 would stand a better chance of being accepted by the majority in our community."&lt;ref name=consult2012/&gt;

===NPCSC resolution===
On 29 December 2007, the NPCSC resolved&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081223214014/http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/2211/longtitle.html Decision Of The Standing Committee Of The National People's Congress On Issues Relating To The Methods For Selecting The Chief Executive Of The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region And For Forming The Legislative Council Of The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region In The Year 2012 And On Issues Relating To Universal Suffrage (Adopted By The Standing Committee Of The Tenth National People's Congress At Its Thirty-First Session On 29 December 2007)], Hong Kong Legal Information Institute&lt;/ref&gt; that: &lt;blockquote&gt;that the election of the fifth Chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the year 2017 may be implemented by the method of universal suffrage; that after the Chief executive is selected by universal suffrage, the election of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region may be implemented by the method of electing all the members by universal suffrage... Appropriate amendments conforming to the principle of gradual and orderly progress may be made to the specific method for selecting the fourth Chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the year 2012 and the specific method for forming the fifth term Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the year 2012 in accordance with the provisions of Articles 45 and 68, and those of Article 7 of Annex I and Article III of Annex II to the Basic Law
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The decision stipulated that:

== The consultation ==
The NPCSC decision became the backbone of the document published by the government on 18 November 2009, entitled the "''Consultation Document on the Methods for Selecting the Chief executive and for Forming the LegCo in 2012''". The government said proposals broadened the scope of political participation and increase substantially the democratic elements in the 2012 elections.&lt;ref name=consult2012&gt;[http://www.cmab-cd2012.gov.hk/doc/consultation_document_en.pdf Public Consultation on the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive and for Forming the Legislative Council in 2012] Government of Hong Kong, 18 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The consultation ended three months later with 47,200 written submissions being received.&lt;ref&gt;Qiao Xiaoyang (15 April 2010). [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=9&amp;art_id=96927&amp;sid=27735875&amp;con_type=3&amp;d_str=20100415&amp;fc=7 Door to universal suffrage is open] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430162406/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=9&amp;art_id=96927&amp;sid=27735875&amp;con_type=3&amp;d_str=20100415&amp;fc=7 |date=30 April 2010 }}, ''The Standard''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variables ===
The government notes that, despite calls from some quarters to discuss universal suffrage models, it has only been authorised by the NPCSC to determine the methods for selecting the CE and for forming the LegCo in 2012; how the two electoral methods should be amended for attaining universal suffrage is outside of its scope.&lt;ref name=consult2012/&gt; It said that "there is still ample room for making amendments to the electoral method to enhance its democratic elements" in 2012, and proposed the following for LegCo elections:&lt;ref name=consult2012/&gt;
* To increase the number of LegCo seats to 70 (from 60). The number of seats to be returned by geographical constituencies ("GCs") through direct elections and those returned by functional constituencies ("FCs") to be increased to 35 respectively;
* to have all the five new FC seats and the existing [[District Councils of Hong Kong|District Council]] seat returned through election by elected District Council members from among themselves, i.e. appointed District Council members will not take part in the election;
* the six District Council seats should be returned through election from among elected District Council members by proportional representation, so that in the 2012 LegCo, 41 seats (i.e. close to 60% of all seats) will be returned through geographical direct or indirect elections;
* that Hong Kong permanent residents who are not of Chinese nationality or who have the right of abode in foreign countries may stand in the elections for 12 FC seats (no change);
* that only elected District Council members will participate in the election of District Council seats in the Election Committee and the LegCo, thus enhancing the democratic elements of the elections.

For Chief executive elections, it proposes:&lt;ref name=consult2012/&gt;
* to increase the number of members of the Election Committee to 1,200;
* to increase the proportion of elected District Council members in the Election Committee;
* to maintain the ratio of one-eighth of the total membership of the Election Committee (i.e. 150 members);
* no upper limit on the number of subscribers should be set at this stage;
* the requirement that the CE should not have any political affiliation should not be changed for the 2012 CE election, but can be reviewed in the longer term.

The ''[[Asia Times]]'' remarked that both proposals for LegCo and for the Chief executive "hedged in with so many ifs and buts that there is no guarantee of Hong Kong getting anything at all... "&lt;ref name="Atimes1"&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/JA11Ad01.html ''Hong Kong on the march – again.]'' ''Asia Times Online'', 11 January 2008. Retrieved 14 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the level of interest in, and the knowledge of, the proposals was low: A poll conducted by the [[University of Hong Kong]] on 18 November of 1,001 people found 68 per cent knew 'little' of what the consultation was all about; a similar survey three months later remained at 70 per cent. The pollster said the resignation plan by five legislators, without sufficient focus on the details of the reforms, shifted attention away from the plan. Albert Ho said the end game needed to be in the sights, because 2012 was only a transition. He dismissed the proposal as "meaningless" because it failed to address the pan-democrats' real concerns.&lt;ref name=wiser&gt;Leung, Ambrose (20 February 2010). "Three months of consultation and none the wiser", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; On a three-day trip to Beijing in late December, Donald Tsang was asked by President [[Hu Jintao]] to handle Hong Kong's constitutional reforms 'in an appropriate manner'. He was told by Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] that Hong Kong 'should start to study major macro-issues relating to holistic developments and plan for the future. It should better resolve some deep-rooted conflicts in Hong Kong, make good uses of Hong Kong's advantages, sharpen Hong Kong's competitiveness and pay more attention to social services and people's livelihood.'&lt;ref name=greener&gt;Cheung, Gary (1 January 2010). "Hopes high for a wealthier, greener and fairer world – Political Reform", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

Pan-democrats all agreed that the proposals do not go far enough, but were divided on what action is needed.&lt;ref name=greener/&gt; Significantly, the Democratic Party opted to engage with Beijing to negotiate, parting company with the Civic Party and the LSD. In January 2010, five legislators from the Civic Party and the LSD resigned their seats as part of the 'Five Constituencies Resignation' concept for meaningful political reform; [[Albert Chan]], [[Alan Leong]], [[Tanya Chan]], [[Leung Kwok-hung|"Longhair" Leung Kwok-hung]] and [[Wong Yuk-man]] resigned from LegCo.&lt;ref name="sinares"&gt;Sina.com.

== The 2009 package ==
In a surprise move, the government unveiled the revised package before they were scheduled. Key proposals, such as increasing the Election Committee for the chief executive election from 800 members to 1,200 in 2012 and increasing the number of Legislative Council members from 60 to 70, remain unchanged. It was proposed that the five additional Legco seats for the district council constituency will be elected by proportional representation instead of block voting as suggested by pan-democrats.&lt;ref name=golden&gt;Lee, Diana, (15 April 2010). [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&amp;art_id=96973&amp;sid=27736844&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100415&amp;fc=7 'Grab this golden chance'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629165410/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&amp;art_id=96973&amp;sid=27736844&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100415&amp;fc=7 |date=29 June 2011 }}, ''The Standard''&lt;/ref&gt; Announcing the plan, Chief Secretary [[Henry Tang]] said the government tried to find the "maximum latitude to enhance the democratic elements of the two elections in 2012." He urged legislators to accept this 'golden opportunity' because there was no room for further concessions.&lt;ref name=golden/&gt; The proposals will be put before Legco on 23 June, before the summer recess.&lt;ref&gt;Leung, Regina (7 June 2010) Political reform vote set for 23 June, ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views on the 2009 package ==

=== Central Government ===
[[Qiao Xiaoyang]], head of the NPC's Hong Kong Basic Law committee, said the reason the Standing Committee ruled that Hong Kong "may" and not "must" have universal suffrage for the 2017 chief executive and 2020 Legislative Council elections was because any change in electoral methods required approval by local lawmakers. He added that passage of the reform package would "create excellent conditions for universal suffrage in the future."&lt;ref name=hks-clout&gt;Lee, Colleen (15 April 2010) [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&amp;art_id=96965&amp;sid=27736915&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100415&amp;fc=7 "Qiao adds clout to reforms"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629165426/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&amp;art_id=96965&amp;sid=27736915&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100415&amp;fc=7 |date=29 June 2011 }}, ''The Standard''&lt;/ref&gt;

At a seminar organised by a coalition of Beijing-friendly groups, deputy director of the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|central government's liaison office]], Li Gang said that lawmakers should act bravely and responsibly to reach consensus, and create favourable conditions for realising the universal suffrage timetable. Li said: "It is impossible for a winner to take all on the issue of constitutional development. There can only be win-win. If one wants to win alone, the result may be lose-lose."&lt;ref name=warns&gt;Fung, Fanny &amp; Leung, Ambrose (5 May 2010). "Beijing warns against another reform veto", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

After the government unveiled the procedures for the LegCo vote, deputy secretary general of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, Qiao Xiaoyang, defined 'universal suffrage'&lt;ref name=define&gt;Wong, Albert &amp; Leung, Ambrose (8 June 2010). "Beijing offers definition of HK suffrage", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; as:
* conferring an equal and universal right to vote
* taking into consideration Hong Kong’s legal status
* being compatible with the executive-led political system
* balancing the interests of different sectors of society
* being beneficial for the development of the city’s capitalist economy
Pan-democrats said Qiao's statement reinforced their concerns, as it offered only the right to vote rather than to stand and nominate others in an election, and paved the way for keeping functional constituencies indefinitely.&lt;ref name=define/&gt;

=== Hong Kong Government ===
Constitutional Affairs minister [[Stephen Lam]] insists the reform proposal is more democratic than the [[2005 Hong Kong electoral reform|2005 package]] which was voted down by the Legislative Council, and was more likely to advance the city's political system if approved. He said that the timetable of universal suffrage in 2017 and 2020 was not an ideal, but asserted that it was "a practical one that is accepted by over 60 percent of residents."&lt;ref name=hks27778167/&gt;

The Democratic Party opting for engagement with Beijing, having assessed was that Beijing was keen to see a breakthrough in the reform talks because it realised that Chief executive Donald Tsang's administration would become a lame-duck administration if his reform package was again defeated.

She criticised the government for dodging important questions such as how universal suffrage reconciled with functional constituencies; how reform will not be blocked in Legco by functional constituency legislators, who make up half the chamber; and how the political system should evolve to improve governance and mitigate the increasing societal conflict and widening wealth gap.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

LSD chairman [[Andrew To]] understood that Donald Tsang does not have the power to initiate democratic reform. He said the package was 'old wine in a new bottle', written to give the illusion of reform, while allowing Hong Kong's vested interests to maintain their political power. He lamented the relegation of real reform off into the vague future.&lt;ref name=views/&gt; To warned Tsang and the pro-Beijing camp not to twisted the definition of universal suffrage against the people's interests, and rejected the pro-Beijing camp's assertions that functional constituencies were compatible with the concept of full universal suffrage.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

[[Anson Chan]] dismissed the latest package as "retrograde": increasing functional constituencies further entrenched narrow vested interests. She called on the government give a clear commitment to abolishing functional constituencies by 2020 at the latest; to make the composition of Election Committee for the chief executive more representative and its workings more transparent; to broaden the electoral base by rebalancing constituencies.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

[[Cardinal Joseph Zen]] expressed his outrage, anger and helplessness at being "treat[ed] like idiots" by the government. He denounced the ''faux-consultation'' on a package which was little different from the undemocratic proposal voted down in 2005, in that it lacked direction, and road map for universal suffrage. "Even if we reject it, it will not affect the introduction of universal suffrage in 2017 and 2020," he said.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

=== Government-friendly groups ===
DAB chairman, [[Tam Yiu-chung]], said that while the proposals could be improved upon, his party supported enlarging the Election Committee to 1,200, and creating five district council functional constituency seats in 2012. He proposed to then open up the six district council functional constituency seats for all members of the public, not just district councillors, to contest.&lt;ref name=views/&gt; In late April, LegCo president [[Jasper Tsang]] increased pressure on pan-democrats, whilst triggering controversy when he indicated his willingness to resign his post to vote for reform proposals.&lt;ref name=marchers&gt;Wong Albert &amp; Cheung, Simpson (3 May 2010) "Marchers call for more progressive reforms", '' South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; He said "Government officials probably also agree my vote is more important than my being Legco president.

Whilst believing the reform package represents a step forward in democratisation, the [[Liberal Party (Hong Kong)|Liberal Party]] expressed disappointment that the package did not address the need to expand the electorate base of functional constituencies.&lt;ref name=views&gt;20 February 2010, "Political Reform: Views On The Big Issue", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Tien (politician)|James Tien]] said that in failing to offer concrete proposals on functional constituencies, the government was "not scratching where it itches". He suggested that under a model where functional constituencies would be retained, voters should be able choose a functional constituency in which to cast a second vote. He said that people would enjoy equal voting rights compatible with the principle of universal suffrage; expert views and sectoral interests would still be represented in a legislature otherwise dominated by career politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Leung, Ambrose (30 April 2010). "James Tien proposes 'one person, two votes' for functional impasse", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent legislator and former security minister [[Regina Ip]] criticised the precipitation of the by-election. She urged the public to refocus on the two methods for selecting the chief executive and electing the legislature in 2012, to forge a consensus on how to move forward in 2012, and lay the foundation for universal suffrage in 2017 and 2020.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

=== The legal profession ===
The [[Law Society of Hong Kong|Law Society]] and [[Hong Kong Bar Association|Bar Association]] reiterated their call for the abolition of functional constituencies as being non-compliant with international law – Article 25(b) of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and Article 21 of the Bill of Rights. They urged the government to put forward a revised consultation document with more progressive proposals, a clear road map on the way forward, and a commitment to abolish functional constituencies.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

Law Society observed that structure of the proposals places a very heavy burden on the chief executive in the three years 2017 to 2020 when major changes were required, and expressed concern that it may thus breach the requirement of the principle of 'gradual and orderly progress' enshrined in Articles 45 and 68 of the Basic Law.&lt;ref name=views/&gt; The Bar Association said that corporate or directors' voting was also incompatible with international law; they said the failure to comply is not mitigated by replacing corporate voting by an authorised representative with voting by directors, executives, member associations, individual members.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

=== Business groups ===
The [[Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce]] supported maintaining functional constituencies, to provide Legco with the necessary expertise in scrutinising bills and policies. But was open to discuss ways to broaden their voter base, such as 'one-person, two-votes'. They hope to see alignment of chief executive with a political party to facilitate governance, and the CE able to appoint legislators from like-minded groups as principal officials to further cement the link between the administration and the legislature.&lt;ref name=views/&gt; In a survey conducted by TNS, more than 60 percent of business and opinion leaders in Hong Kong want Beijing to promise to take steps in 2016 to pave the way for universal suffrage and abolish functional constituencies; 43% of those surveyed believed the central government should make more concessions to ensure the passage of the package, while one-quarter say the pan-democratic camp should offer concessions.&lt;ref name=TNS&gt;Cheung, Gary (24 May 2010).  "Most want vow from Beijing on 2016 progress". ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the possible veto, 43% of the respondents would favour a veto if there was no roadmap for universal suffrage, compared with 39 per cent who disagreed. A pro-Beijing legislator for [[Kowloon East (constituency)|Kowloon East]] said the majority of Hong Kong people considered the proposal inadequate and hoped Beijing would make more concessions.&lt;ref name=TNS/&gt;

=== Pundits ===
[[Joseph Wong]], former secretary for civil service, suggested the government could go further in broadening the democratic base of electorates for the Election Committee by adding new seats in three sub-sectors, to be returned by individual voting; the nomination threshold for the 2012 chief executive election should be lowered from one-eighth to one-tenth, or 160 nominations. He suggest that Legco should remain at 60, but five trade-based seats – education, legal, medical, health services and social welfare – should be returned by 'one man, one vote'.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

Simon Young, director of the Centre of Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, said they hoped for a gradual rearrangement of functional constituencies sectors to achieve greater balance, and to diminish the influence of the most problematic functional constituencies – the commercial, industrial and financial sectors, which operate by corporate or directors' votes, and then abolishing them by 2020.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

=== Civic groups ===
Former legislator, [[Christine Loh]] of [[Civic Exchange]] acknowledged the HK government had little room for manoeuvre. She said it was widely held that Hong Kong elections were unfair. Functional constituencies and sub-sector elections for the legislature and chief executive selection respectively needed urgent change to remove corporate voting because vested business interests enjoy an excessively dominant role in politics – the alignment of commercial interests with political interests creating a deadly combination.&lt;ref name=views/&gt; She said it was regrettable that Tsang and his team of officials could not be seen to stand and fight side by side with Hong Kong people, but were instead little more than Beijing's messengers.&lt;ref name=Loh1&gt;Christine Loh (18 June 2010) "HK officials' authority under threat in political reform deadlock", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers' group Education Convergence said there needed to be a road map for universal suffrage for the chief executive and LegCo elections in 2017 and 2020. The one-eighth nomination threshold for chief executive candidates must be lowered to 50 votes. The government must promise that all functional constituencies will be abolished in 2020.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

=== Public view ===
In a Hong Kong University poll in May, 48% respondents said legislators should accept the proposals, while the government cited a [[One Country Two Systems Research Institute]] survey of 856 people, which suggested 60 per cent supported the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose Leung (4 May 2010).

Following the by-election, the government stepped up efforts to gain support for the reform package. It commissioned two television advertisements which emphasised the need to move forwards with democratisation. Tsang began to campaign via radio interviews, and he and his ministers took to the streets to mobilise support. The roadshow culminated with a televised debate with Audrey Eu of the Civic Party.

Ministers continued their campaign roadshow on the weekend of 5/6 June: they split into three teams to cover the territory. Henry Tang led a team into shopping malls in Kowloon; Donald Tsang made stops at destinations on Hong Kong Island, while John Tsang led colleagues to the New Territories in an attempt to distribute leaflets and badges to the public. Despite the government disclosing ministers' itineraries at short notice, the roadshow was greeted the destinations by students, activists and pan-democratic supporters who had gathered to show their opposition and to demand abolition of functional constituencies. Addressing the crowds, Tsang accused the protesters as being 'the minority'.

==Pro-government rally==
On the day, organisers estimated 120,000 participated in the pro-government rally; Police estimated 70,000, and said 43,000 of them subsequent marched on to Central. Attendees at the rally included Donald Tsang, Liberal Party leader, [[Miriam Lau]], DAB chairman [[Tam Yiu-chung]] and Executive Council convenor [[Leung Chun-ying]].&lt;ref&gt;Wan, Adrian (20 June 2010). "70,000 rally in support of electoral reform proposals", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation phase or the rally was marred by controversies– there were accusations that organisers were buying support, and certain schools were caught up in exerting undue pressure:

===Junket controversy===
Pro-government groups planning a rally on 19 June were attempting to attract participants to their rally in support of the reform proposals by offering free or low-priced junkets. The Hong Kong Quanzhou Association offered registered participants a HK$200 "meal allowance";&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Albert (7 June 2010) "Questions raised over offer of HK$200 each to rally participants", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Lau]], a government-appointed member of Eastern district council, Wong Wang-tai and Stephen Ng of [[Wan Chai]] district council advertised a "promotional tour" through New Century Society and the Happy Valley Residents' Association for HK$30 (US$3.80). A promotional leaflet reads: "Have fun on a tour to Lei Yu Mun, and support the political system to move forward". The organisers denied it was of a political nature, saying it was "only a cheap tour", so it was not inappropriate to ask for a [[quid pro quo]].&lt;ref&gt;Ng Kang-chung (8 June 2010) "A tempting offer to rally support", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The Beijing-friendly Federation of Trade Unions counter-accused the CTU of offering participants of a Labour Day march an eight-course seafood meal and transportation for HK$40. The FTU, which expects 20,000 to join the rally, said it had been "negligent" in failing to issue a guideline to affiliated organisations, but reiterated the alliance would not accept handing out cash to participants.&lt;ref&gt;Fung, Fanny &amp; Chong, Tanna (11 June 2010). "Meal for marchers nothing new, unionist says", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

===School controversy===
Schools were also the subject of controversy when it was revealed that the MFBM Chan Lui Chung Tak Memorial College in [[Tin Shui Wai]] tried to force its students to attend the rally by making it part of the curriculum for which academic credit would be awarded. After the school's notice had circulated widely on the Internet, and outcry among parents, the school's principal made participation voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;Yau, Elaine (16 June 2010). "School tells pupils they have to march", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching staff at the Federation of Education Workers Wong Cho Bau Secondary School in [[Tung Chung]] complained to the media that the principal declared participation in the march "an [compulsory] extra-professional development activity" aimed to provide teachers with an opportunity to gain a better understanding of the political situation. The school later denied compulsion, saying it merely informed teachers about the march during a regular conference and never asked them to make public their stance on political development.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, Rebecca &amp; Ho, Serinah (18 June 2010).

==Televised debate==
[[File:Tsang-eu-debate.jpg|thumb|300px|podium shot of Donald Tsang (left) ready to engage Audrey Eu (right) in debate on 17 June 2010]]
The one-hour televised debate between Audrey Eu duly took place at 18:35 on 17 June at the [[Central Government Offices]] with only a TV audience as planned. A three-member panel – headed by the debate moderator Ng Ming-lam – sifted through the 2,876 questions received, and drew lots to select questions for the debate.&lt;ref&gt;16 June 2010 "2,876 questions for TV debate", RTHK News&lt;/ref&gt;
Terrestrial broadcasters [[Television Broadcasts Limited|TVB]] and [[Asia Television|ATV]] said the debate's audience rating averaged out at 1.21&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, Simpson &amp; Chong, Tanna (19 June 2010). "Pan-democrats favoured even if reforms fail: poll", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; Pundits were unanimous that Eu had trounced Tsang in the debate; an overwhelming majority (some 70%) of respondents polled by the HKU and Lingnan University said Eu had won, and some 15% declared in favour of Tsang.&lt;ref name=hks28627281/&gt; Eu's performance was described a polished and engaging, which Tsang was universally panned as being unconvincing, and being reliant on a prepared script.&lt;ref name=hks28627281/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broadhead, Ivan (18 June 2010).

==Legislative vote==
The Hong Kong government announced on 7 June that their proposals, basically unchanged since they were unveiled, would be submitted to LegCo in two motions on 23 June: 1) the Amendment to method for forming HK's LegCo, and 2) Amendment to method of selecting the Chief executive.

Chief Secretary Henry Tang said: "The package was put forth after careful deliberations. It was formulated after extensive consultation and discussions among members of the public, different sectors of the community and Legco." He reiterated that there was little room, if any, for more changes since the government had already "pushed to the limit" its authority to reform the political structure arising from a 2007 decision by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Pan-democrats, who said any proposals which gave no indication of how universal suffrage would eventually be implemented in 2017 and 2020 were unacceptable, further said the division of new seats in the Election Committee would effectively give more political power to unelected, pro-Beijing figures; all 23 pan-democrat lawmakers signed a declaration pledging to veto the government proposal unless clauses are added to indicate a commitment to abolish functional constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Albert (8 June 2010) "Die is cast on electoral reform proposals", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

One week before the LegCo vote, while the government was continuing with its 'Act Now' campaign – described by Albert Ho as "a hard sell" – activists were mobilising a protest in front of LegCo on the day of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Albert &amp; Chong, Tanna (14 June 2010).  "Young activists aim for huge June 23 rally", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; Police leave has been cancelled between 22 and 24 June, ready to deploy in anticipation of mass demonstrations on the scale of the [[Opposition to the Guangzhou-Hong Kong Express Rail Link]] in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Tsang, Phyllis &amp; Fung, Fanny (13 June 2010) "Police gear up for protests over reforms", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the weekend of 19 June, the official stance softened considerably: senior officials were quoted in the press saying that proposals which once supposedly violated the Basic Law or the NPCSC decision were now viewed as acceptable. The ''South China Morning Post'' revealed that Donald Tsang had written a letter the previous week to [[Xi Jinping]], Vice-president in charge of Hong Kong affairs, requesting Beijing's endorsement. One SCMP source was quoted as saying, "The chief executive warned in the letter that Hong Kong could face a serious governance crisis if the electoral reform package was vetoed by Legco again, and his ability to govern Hong Kong effectively would be in doubt". The source said [[Hu Jintao]] personally approved the proposals, as the leadership feared further strengthening of the "radical" pan-democrats.&lt;ref name=uturn/&gt;

At their meeting on 21 June, the Democratic Party membership voted by a two-thirds majority in support of their leadership's proposal.&lt;ref name=uturn&gt;Cheung, Gary (22 June 2010) "Beijing's U-turn 'to thwart radicals'", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the breakthrough was not without cost. Within the party, Martin Lee dissented, and said he was contemplating resigning from the party he helped to found, lamenting, "It's not the party I knew". Legislators [[Andrew Cheng]] and [[James To]] said they were still undecided on their LegCo votes, as their loyalty to the party was in conflict with their responsibility to their constituents. The rift with other pan-democrats widened as the revised proposals were still considered inadequate.&lt;ref name=martin&gt;Ng Kang-chung, Tsang, Phyllis and Chong, Tanna (22 June 2010) "Martin Lee may quit party over reform", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The Civic Party's membership endorsed their leadership position against the revised plan.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Colleen; Siu, Beatrice &amp; Yau, Thomas (22 June 2010) [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=99659&amp;sid=28661614&amp;con_type=3&amp;d_str=20100622&amp;sear_year=2010 "Democrats vote yes"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174311/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=99659&amp;sid=28661614&amp;con_type=3&amp;d_str=20100622&amp;sear_year=2010# |date=29 June 2011 }}, ''The Standard''&lt;/ref&gt; There was a very hostile reaction from the League of Social Democrats. 38 civic groups accused the Democratic Party of reneging on its commitment, selling out Hong Kong people and failing to uphold its principles.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Albert; Leung, Ambrose &amp; Chong, Tanna (21 June 2010) "Democrats feel the heat over reform plan", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adjournment vote ===
In introducing a motion to delay the vote for two weeks, proposer [[Cyd Ho]] (Civic Act-up) said: "What you are doing is requesting the pan-democratic camp to write you a blank cheque … or do the equivalent of telling you the PIN of our ATM card". Constitutional Affairs minister, Stephen Lam, replied: "We should not mark time by delaying the debate on the resolutions. We should stride ahead and move towards universal suffrage."&lt;ref name=quitter&gt;Wong, Albert (24 June 2010) "Electoral reform row makes one Democrat a quitter, others bitter", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; Accountancy FC legislator [[Paul Chan (Hong Kong legislator)|Paul Chan]] (Independent) supported the delay, saying the proposals would then win widespread support through better public knowledge. Audrey Eu said that voting just hours after rough proposal was "extremely disrespectful to the people, disrespectful to this council, and there are a number of issues left blank which should be resolved"; Albert Chan said the new proposal lacked consultation, and criticised the government of using political power to hijack public opinion. [[Lau Kong-wah]] of the DAB dismissed those who supported the adjournment as people who just "oppose everything".&lt;ref name=quitter/&gt; [[Margaret Ng]] (Civic Party) expressed concern that the government's drafting of vague and open resolutions would give them the opportunity to make last-minute changes without notifying Legco. The adjournment motion failed, after a 5-hour debate; it was supported by directly elected legislators, who voted 18:10 in favour of adjournment, but functional constituency legislators voted 24:6 against. [[Ip Kwok-him]] (DAB) later criticised pan-democrats for filibustering with Ho's motion.&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, Gary; Fung, Fanny &amp; Wong, Albert (24 June 2010) "Campaign to defer reform vote fails", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legco speeches ===
Founding member of the Democratic Party, [[Andrew Cheng]], who had publicly pondered his moral dilemma in supporting the vote, announced in his Legco speech that he would quit the party because "small, but critical differences of opinion" prevented him from fulfilling his election pledge to strive for universal suffrage in 2012. He however urged other pan-democrats not to doubt the party's sincerity, to stop these personal attacks and continue to pave the way to democracy. Unionist lawmaker [[Lee Cheuk-yan]], who declared his intention to vote against the revised proposals, also urged fellow pan-democrats not to forget human relationships: "How has Hong Kong come to this, where we are scolding our own friends? ... Why do people feel the Democratic Party is no longer one of us? I absolutely do not feel like this ... I absolutely cannot utter the words that they have 'betrayed the people'."&lt;ref name=quitter/&gt;

This did not stop Albert Chan from accusing the Democrats of putting party interests above those of the people, and of distortion and misleading them: "To strive for universal suffrage in 2012, that was your election pledge ... If you vote in contradiction to your election pledge, then you have betrayed the people."&lt;ref name=quitter/&gt; A subdued Emily Lau conceded she was effectively reneging on her election pledge, saying: "I want to apologise to all those who voted for me ... I accept the condemnation of the people."&lt;ref name=quitter/&gt; James To, who had been 'undecided', supported the proposal. Expressing his grave misgivings, he said he feared the creation of "super-functional constituencies" with an even larger mandate than geographical constituency lawmakers, would make them impossible to abolish. To reserved a lament for the change he remarked in Emily Lau, who once had the reputation of a firebrand: "I thought she would bring a firmer and harder stance on principles and influence the Democratic Party. But instead, it has been the party that has changed her."&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Albert and Fung, Fanny (25 June 2010). "James To criticises – and votes for proposal"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amendment to method for selecting the Chief executive===
After a nine-hour debate, the resolution which increases the size of the [[Election Committee]] which elects the chief executive in 2012 from 800 to 1,200 members, won endorsement at 2.20&amp;nbsp;pm on 24 June by the legislature by 46 votes to 13.

===Assent===
Formal assent to the draft amendments to Annexes I and II to the Basic Law concerning the methods of selecting the Chief executive and forming the Legislative Council was given by the Chief executive on 29 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Press release (29 June 2010). [http://news.gov.hk/en/category/administration/100629/html/100629en01003.htm Constitution – "Consent signed for draft Basic Law amendments"]{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Hong Kong Government&lt;/ref&gt;
The National People's Congress Standing Committee in Beijing rubber-stamped the two amendments to the Basic Law at its session held on 28 August 2010, paving the way for local legislation on the specific electoral arrangements to be enacted.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Diana (30 August 2010) [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=102302&amp;sid=29411525&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100830&amp;sear_year=2010 "Electoral changes nearer as NPC gives green light"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011074105/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=102302&amp;sid=29411525&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100830&amp;sear_year=2010 |date=11 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Beijing has been credited for successfully splitting the Pan-democrat camp.&lt;ref name="Asen"&gt;[http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2547&amp;Itemid=173 "Beijing Splits Hong Kong's Pro-Democracy Forces."], Asiasentinel.com. Retrieved 26 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The new reform package has been said to be only a little more democratic than ones rejected in 2005, while following the lines of moderate democrats and rejecting radical ones.&lt;ref name="Asen" /&gt; Sources have warned that [[Taiwan]] should watch out for the "divide and rule" strategy China used in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="Asen" /&gt; Some anti-communist graffiti was daubed on the Legislative Council building following the contentious Legco vote in June.&lt;ref&gt;Yahoo.com [http://hk.news.yahoo.com/article/100625/4/iuq6.html "官乘車離開 4人坐馬路被捕"].

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in the [[Central African Republic]] on 13 and 14 December 2015.&lt;ref name=R&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-centralafrica-referendum-idUKKBN0TX1T620151214 Voting extended for Central African referendum after violence] Reuters, 14 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum was originally scheduled to be held on 5 October 2015, prior to general elections,&lt;ref name=ENCA&gt;[https://www.enca.com/africa/central-african-republic-council-adopts-new-constitution Central African Republic council adopts new constitution] ENCA, 1 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; but was later delayed. Violence on polling day led to voting being extended for another day.&lt;ref name=R/&gt; The new constitution was approved by 93% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/central-african-republic-voters-say-yes-to-new-constitution/a-18933653 Central African Republic voters say yes to new constitution] Deutsche Welle, 22 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[Central African general election, 2015–16|General elections]] followed on 30 December. 

==Background==
{{see|Central African Republic Civil War (2012–present)}}
The new constitution was approved by a large majority in the Transitional Council on 30 August 2015.&lt;ref name=ENCA/&gt; It provides for the creation of a Senate and a National Election Authority, as well as requiring decisions made by the President and Prime Minister to be approved by ministers, and for the government to inform the National Assembly when a contract relating to mineral resources is signed.&lt;ref name=ENCA/&gt; Only 15,000 copies of the new constitution were published.

==Conduct==
An unidentified [[MINUSCA]] source said that voting was delayed in several districts across [[Bangui]], although not in the PK5 district, where gunfire broke out overnight. Approximately two million citizens registered to vote. Many of the 5,600 polling stations were located in remote regions.&lt;Ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2015/12/13/441548/Central-African-Republic-Bangui-Referendum-Constitution- Constitutional referendum begins in violence-wracked CAR] Press TV, 13 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5019">In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, '''abuse of rights''' (also known as Prohibition of Chicane) is the exercise of a [[Natural and legal rights|legal right]] only to cause annoyance, harm, or injury to another. The abuser is liable for the harm caused by their actions. Some examples of this are [[abuse of power]], [[barratry (common law)|barratry]], [[frivolous litigation|frivolous]] or [[vexatious litigation]], a [[spite fence]] or [[spite wall|wall]], [[forum shopping]], [[abuse of process]], [[malicious prosecution]], [[tax avoidance]] (vs. [[Tax avoidance#Anti-avoidance measures|anti-avoidance rules]], [[step transaction doctrine]], [[economic substance]]), etc. The principle is a creature of case law and was expanded from the neighborhood law doctrine of ''[[aemulatio vicini]]'' under the ''[[jus commune]]''. This principle departs from the classical theory that “he who uses a right injures no one” (= ''neminem laedit qui suo iure utitur''), instead embracing the maxim “a right ends where abuse begins” (= ''le droit cesse où l'abus commence'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcel Planiol]], ''Traité élémentaire de droit civil'', 11th edn., No. 871, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation ==
The [[:de:Rechtsmissbrauch|abuse of rights]] principle is laid out in German law by the so-called ''Schikaneverbot'' ‘ban on vexatiousness’ ([[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]] [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__226.html §226]). It reads as follows:
{{Verse translation|{{lang|de|Die Ausübung eines Rechts ist unzulässig, 
wenn sie nur den Zweck haben kann, einem anderen Schaden zuzufügen.}}
|
The exercise of a right is unlawful if its purpose 
is only to cause harm to another.}}

Article 2 of the ''Titre préliminaire'' to the [[Swiss Civil Code]] states: 
{{Verse translation|{{lang|fr|Chacun est tenu d'exercer ses droits et d'exécuter ses obligations selon les règles de la bonne foi. L'abus manifeste d'un droit n'est pas protégé par la loi.}}|Everyone is expected to exercise their rights and fulfill their [[Law of obligations|obligations]] according to the rules of [[Good faith (law)|good faith]]. The manifest abuse of a right is not protected by [[statute]].}}

Articles 19, 20 and 21 of the [[Civil Code of the Philippines]] state that:

* Art. 19. “Every person must, in the exercise of his rights and in the performance of his duties, act with justice, give everyone his due and observe honesty and good faith.”
* Art. 20. “Every person who, contrary to law, wilfully or negligently causes damage to another, shall indemnify the latter for the same.”
* Art. 21. “Any person who wilfully causes loss or injury to another in manner that is contrary to morals, good customs or public policy shall compensate the latter for the damage.”

== Conditions ==
At least one of four conditions is required to invoke the doctrine:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abuse of Rights|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/a/abuse-of-rights/|work=uslegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*the predominant motive for exercising the right is to cause harm
*no serious or legitimate interest exists for judicial protection
*the exercise of the right is ''contra bonos mores'' or violates [[good faith]] or elementary fairness (equity)
*the right is exercised for a purpose other than its intended legal purpose.

The principle does not exist in [[Common law|common law jurisdictions]].

In [[Scots law]] (which is mixed civil/common law jurisdiction), abuse of rights is called ''aemulatio vicini'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strange Gods in the Twenty-First Century: the Doctrine of Aemulatio Vicini|author=Elspeth Reid|url=http://edinburgh.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.3366/edinburgh/9780748623358.001.0001/upso-9780748623358-chapter-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical situation involves the person going to an employment agency and then the employment agency sending the person to an actual employer for proper work.

==History==
The [[International Labour Organization]] called for the establishment of public employment agencies in their place. To prevent the abusive practices of private agencies, they were to be fully abolished or at least tightly regulated. In most countries, they are legal but regulated.

Probably inspired by the dissenting judgments in a [[United States Supreme Court]] case called ''[[Adams v. Tanner]]'', the [[International Labour Organization]]'s first ever Recommendation was targeted at fee-charging agencies. The Unemployment Recommendation, 1919 (No.1), Art. 1 called for each member to

&lt;blockquote&gt;"take measures to prohibit the establishment of employment agencies which charge fees or which carry on their business for profit. Where such agencies already exist, it is further recommended that they be permitted to operate only under government licenses, and that all practicable measures be taken to abolish such agencies as soon as possible."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Unemployment Convention, 1919]], Art. 2 required instead the alternative of 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"a system of free public employment agencies under the control of a central authority. Committees, which shall include representatives of employers and workers, shall be appointed to advise on matters concerning the carrying on of these agencies."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1933, the [[Fee-Charging Employment Agencies Convention, 1933 (shelved)|Fee-Charging Employment Agencies Convention (No.34)]] formally called for abolition. The exception was if the agencies were licensed and a fee scale was agreed in advance. In 1949, a [[Fee-Charging Employment Agencies Convention (Revised), 1949|new revised Convention (No.96)]] was produced. That kept the same scheme but secured an ‘opt out’ (Art. 2) for members that did not wish to sign up. Agencies were an increasingly entrenched part of the labor market. The United States did not sign up to the Conventions. The latest Convention, the [[Private Employment Agencies Convention, 1997]] (No.181) takes a much softer stance and calls merely for regulation.

==Particular jurisdictions==
===European Union===
 The problem related to the Temporary agency work in Europe has formally achieved its maturity through the implementation of the Council Directive 2008/104/ECafter nearly three decades of debate. In this way, the directive as being the third part of the European Union's employment law package to protect atypical working ( which includes part-time workers and fixed-term workers), aims  both to establish a suitable framework for the use of temporary agency work and to develop a flexible form of working.

===Germany===
In Germany the [[:de:Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz|''Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz'']] (Employee Hiring Law of 1972) regulates the agency relationship. It Following the provisions in the ''[[Burgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'' (Civil Code) on the law of leasing goods or finance, the agency relationship is seen as a triangular arrangement, with different obligations on each side. The worker is an employee of the agency only. The contract between the agency and the end-employer is termed as a hire of labour. Between the worker and the end-employer there is no contract. There is only a statutory obligation to give equal treatment in terms and conditions of work.

===United Kingdom===
{{main|UK agency worker law}}
The UK's main piece of legislation falls under the [[Employment Agencies Act 1973]], which required licensing until 1994. There is an exception, for employment agencies working in the agricultural, shellfishing and food packing sectors, under the [[Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004]].

===United States===
*''[[Adams v. Tanner]]''
* In ''[[Ribnik v. McBride]]'', 277 US 350 (1928) the Court struck down a similar New Jersey law attempting to regulate agencies, Justices Stone, Brandeis and Holmes dissenting. This is probably no longer good law.
*Doubt was placed on the leading dicta of ''[[Adams v. Tanner]]'' in ''[[Olsen v. State of Nebraska]]'' 313 US 236 (1941) and ''[[Lincoln Union v. Northwestern Co.]]'', 335 US 525 (1949) 535. In the latter, Mr Justice Black, said that ''Adams v. Tanner'' was part of the "constitutional philosophy" which struck down [[minimum wage]]s and maximum working hours.

[[Image:Nuremberg Race Laws 73901.jpg|right|thumb|Nuremberg Race Laws]]

'''Anti-Jewish legislation in pre-war Nazi Germany''' comprised several laws that segregated the Jews from German society and restricted Jewish people's political, legal and civil rights. Major legislative initiatives included a series of restrictive laws passed in 1933, the [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935, and a final wave of legislation preceding Germany's entry into [[World War II]].

== 1933 Anti-Jewish Legislation ==

=== Enabling Act ===

The Enabling Act established the power of the Nazi Party to pass law [[by decree]], bypassing the approval of parliament. It was passed on March 24, 1933, and effectively nullified the [[Weimar Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz |last=Schleunes |first=Karl |year=1970 |location= |publisher= |isbn=978-0252000928 |pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service ===

In April 1933, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, or 'Civil Service Law', as it was more commonly known when passed, established the ability of the Nazi Party to legally remove undesirables from the civil service profession, including doctors, teachers and lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=102–103|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many local governments also did not allow for the Jews to slaughter animals. In turn, this prevented the Jews from obeying Jewish dietary laws.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

This Law created the basis for the years to come, the Nazi party saw "racial purity [as a] condition of superior cultural creation and of the construction of a powerful state".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nazi Germany and The Jews|last=Friedlander|first=Saul|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1997|isbn=0-06-019042-6|location=|pages=33|quote=Racial Purity was a condition of superior cultural creation and of the construction of a powerful state|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Civil Service Law was used to purify Germany through excluding Jews from key areas of the German community.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service "defined the three groups of undesirable civil servants and provided for their dismissal". The first group included those who had been appointed after November 9, 1918, and could be removed if they did not have the proper training, which essentially meant anyone could fit into these standards. The Second group were those who were deemed by their past that they would not always support the national state. The third group were any "non-Aryans", a way of excluding the Jews without explicitly mentioning "Jews" in the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=103|quote="It defined three groups of undesirable civil servants and provided for their dismissal"|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law Concerning Admission to the Legal Profession ===

This act of legislation was also passed in April as a supplement to the Civil Service Law. This law specifically attacked judges and public prosecutors, and forbade any Jews from taking the bar exam which was necessary to become a lawyer.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=105|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decree Regarding Physicians' Services with the National Health Service ===

This law affected Jewish doctors, and subsequently Jewish health care. Passed also in April, under this legislation, patients who saw a "non-Aryan" doctor would not be covered under the national health insurance, thus excluding Jewish doctors from German society.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== The Law Against the Over-Crowding of German Schools ===

Looking to further enact their racial agenda, the Nazi party then looked toward curbing educational policy. On April 25, 1933, the Law Against the Over-Crowding of German schools was passed, and required an end to any Weimar teachings that discussed democracy and equality; it enforced the teaching of racial pride. Under the guise of a concern for educational over-crowding, the Nazis limited the number of Jewish students enrolled in German schools to 1.5% of the total enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=1970|year=|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=106–107|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== July 1933 Citizenship and Denaturalization Law ===

With the goal of excluding Jews from having full citizenship rights an Advisory Committee for Population and Race Policy met at the ministry of the Interior to discuss a new citizenship law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nazi Germany and The Jews|last=Friedlander|first=Saul|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1997|isbn=0-06-019042-6|location=|pages=146|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What followed was the Denaturalization Law passed on July 14. As a result of this law, the Reich government could take away the citizenship of those who were deemed "undesirable", applying to anyone who had been given citizenship by the Weimar government. Those who saw the results of this law first were the "150,000 Eastern Jews in Germany".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=110|quote="... revoke the citizenship of people it considered to be undesirable." "...against the estimated 150,000 Eastern Jews in Germany."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hereditary Farm Law ===

Passed on September 29, 1933, this law "excluded Jews from owning farmland or engaging in agriculture". It stated that only Germans could now be farmers. Though the law had minimal effect due to the lack of Jews involved in farming, it still displayed a central idea of the Nazi party that, "The Reich government passes this law to secure the peasant foundations of our blood line through instituting the ancient customs of land inheritance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=112|quote="excluded Jews from owning farmland or engaging in agriculture". "The Reich government passes this law to secure the peasant foundations of our blood line through instituting the ancient customs of land inheritance."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Establishment of the Chambers of Culture ===

On September 29, 1933, the power of Jewish Cultural life in Germany was transferred to [[Joseph Goebbels]], who established chambers of culture that would regulate activity in their chamber of either film, theater, music, fine arts, literature, broadcasting, and the press.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=113|quote="producer of and actors in a movie to the ticket collectors in the theater". "Licensed permission from the chamber president."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Chamber had the power to exclude anyone involved in any of the facets of culture, even without an "Aryan clause" written into the legislation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

For example, the film chamber could dismiss any Jews involved in any stages of the film-making process including the "producer, actors and ticket collectors in the theater". To continue involvement in the film industry one would need "licensed permission from the chamber president".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

As a supplement to the Chambers of Culture, a journalism law went into effect on October 4, 1933, stating that to produce work for the press, journalists and editors would also need specific legal permission.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==[[Nuremberg Laws]] ==
At their [[Nuremberg rallies|annual party rally held in Nuremberg]] in September 1935, the Nazi leaders announced a set of three new laws to further regulate and exclude Jews from German Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=120|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws now known as the Nuremberg laws served also as the legality for the arrests and violence against Jews that would come to follow.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Germans and the Final Solution|last=Bankier|first=David|publisher=|year=1992|isbn=0-631-17968-2|location=|pages=41–42|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nuremberg Laws were created in response to Hitler's demands for broadened citizenship laws that could "underpin the more specifically racial-biological anti-Jewish legislation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nazi Germany and The Jews|last=Friedlander|first=Saul|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1997|isbn=0-06-019042-6|location=|pages=148|quote="underpin the more specifically racial-biological anti-Jewish legislation".|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were made to reflect the party principles that had been outlined in the points Hitler had written in the [[National Socialist Program]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Germans and the Final Solution|last=Bankier|first=David|publisher=|year=1992|isbn=0-631-17968-2|location=|pages=43|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reich Flag Law ===

The first law stated that black, red, and white were the national colors, and the swastika flag was the new national flag. Per Hitler, this law was stated to "re-pay a debt of gratitude to the movement, under whose symbol Germany regained its freedom, in that they fulfill a significant item on the program of the National Socialist Party".&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nazi Germany and The Jews|last=Friedlander|first=Saul|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1997|isbn=0-06-019042-6|location=|pages=142|quote="Repay a debt of gratitude to the Movement, under whose symbol Germany regained its freedom, in that they fulfill a significant item on the program of the National Socialist Party."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Citizenship Law ===

The second law established who would be granted full political and civic rights and those who would now be deprived of them. Citizenship rights were to be granted to those who were citizens of the Reich, which were only individuals classified as being of "German or related blood"; therefore, Jews were excluded from any and all citizenship rights, becoming ''Staatsangehörige'' or state subjects,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; essentially making them foreigners in their own country.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== The Law for the Defense of German Blood and Honor ===

The third law forbade marriage and any relations between Jews and German citizens. The law also made any previously existing marriages or those contracted outside of Germany invalid. Furthermore, Jews were forbidden from employing German female citizens who were under 45 years old. Under this law, Jews were also forbidden to raise the German Flag.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Supplemental Decrees ===

After the Nuremberg Laws were passed, the Nazi Party also introduced supplemental decrees to the Citizenship Law and the Law for the Defense of German Blood and Honor to specifically outline who would be considered a Jew, and who would therefore be subject to the Nuremberg Laws' exclusionary principles

On November 14, the first supplemental decree was published, and it defined a Jewish person as anyone who had at least three full Jewish grandparents, had two Jewish grandparents and were married to a Jewish spouse, belonged to the Jewish religion at the time of the law's publication, or who entered the Jewish religion later.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nazi Germany and the Jews|last=Friedlander|first=Saul|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1997|isbn=0-06-019042-6|location=|pages=149|quote="between a Jew and a Mischling with one Jewish Grandparent, between a Mischling and another each with one Jewish Grandparent, and between a Mischling with two Jewish Grandparents and a German."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mischling|''Mischlinge'']] or the German legal term for those who had "Aryan" and Jewish blood, were also clarified to determine who would be considered a Jew. Those that were three-quarters Jewish were Jewish as well as those who were half Jewish due to their choice of becoming Jewish via a Jewish spouse or through joining a Jewish community.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

A second decree was published on December 21, which stated that Jewish professors, teachers, physicians, lawyers, and notaries who were state employees, and had previously been exempt, would now be dismissed from their positions.

In the first decree to the Law for the Defense of German Blood and Honor, it stated which specific marriages were forbidden. These included those "between a Jew and a ''Mischling'' with one Jewish Grandparent, between a ''Mischling'' and another each with one Jewish Grandparent, and between a ''Mischling'' with two Jewish Grandparents and a German".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Post-Nuremberg legislation ==

=== 1936 Berlin Olympic Games ===

In order to prevent foreign criticism of Germany, and keep the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, and to prevent economic loss and a blow to German prestige, Hitler eased the anti-Jewish stance momentarily.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=9780252000928|location=|pages=126–127|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, all anti-Jewish signs near the site of the winter Olympics were to be removed. Though, normally, this would be considered a sign of good faith, it was, in actuality, only an action taken to ensure the Olympics would be held in Germany by preventing international disapproval.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Second wave of anti-Jewish legislation, 1938-1939 ===
After the Nuremberg Legislations and during 1938, "worse than total expropriation was to follow: Economic harassment and even violence would henceforward be used to force the Jews to flee the Reich or the newly annexed Austria. Within the second phase, 1938 was the fateful turning point."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nazi Germany and The Jews|last=Friedlander|first=Saul|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1997|isbn=0-06-019042-6|location=|pages=180|quote="worse than total expropriation was to follow: Economic harassment and even violence would henceforward be used to force the Jews to flee the Reich or the newly annexed Austria. Within the second phase 1938 was the fateful turning point."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De-certification of all Jewish physicians, who were no longer allowed to treat German patients and forced to refer to themselves as "sick-treaters", a degrading term.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jews: A History|last=Efron, Weitzman, Lehmann|first=John, Steven, Matthias|publisher=Pearson Education inc|year=2004|isbn=0-205-89626-X|location=|pages=410–411|quote="sick-treaters"|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

March 22, 1938 Jews were forbidden from owning private gardens&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

July 27, 1938 A decree was enforced stating all streets in Germany needed to be re-named&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

November 12, 1938 Jews were forbidden from attending movie theaters, the opera, and concerts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

November 15, 1938 Jewish children barred from attending public school&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The essential robbery of Jews became legal when Jews were forced on February 21, 1939, to turn in all jewelry of any value.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In this second wave of legislation, Jews were ostracized even further from society, with strict restrictions living under "a German regime that practiced terror and arbitrariness through the judicial system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jews: A History|last=Efron, Weitzman, Lehmann|first=John, Steven, Matthias|publisher=Pearson Education Inc|year=2004|isbn=0-205-89626-X|location=|pages=413|quote="a German regime that practiced terror and arbitrariness through the judicial system."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kristallnacht ==

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1970-083-42, Magdeburg, zerstörtes jüdisches Geschäft.jpg|right|thumb|''Kristallnacht'', example of physical damage]]

[[Kristallnacht]] or the night of broken glass refers to Jewish pogroms that took place on November 9 and 10 in 1938. This wave of violence took place in Germany, annexed Austria, and areas of Sudetenland that were occupied by Germany.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005201|title=Kristallnacht|last=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|first=|date=|website=Holocaust Encyclopedia|publisher=|access-date=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attacks took place against synagogues, Jewish-owned businesses, other Jewish establishments, and Jewish citizens in general. More than 100 Jewish people were killed, and thousands more were arrested during these attacks.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2008|title=Remembering Kristallnacht|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/218742963|journal=The Jerusalem Report|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the start to organized Nazi attacks, and the mass incarceration of the Jews. There was no clear Instructions on how to execute the violence, so it caused the destroying of Jewish property and inhumane treatment of Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doescher|first=Hans|year=2011|title=Kristallnacht 1938|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/873572091|journal=Shofar|volume=|pages=131–132|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rioters destroyed 267 synagogues throughout Germany, Austria, and Sudetenland. The firefighter were instructed to prevent the flames from spreading to nearby buildings, but not to put the fires out on the burning synagogues. There was also about 7,500 Jewish-owned establishments that were robbed and had their windows shattered. About 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and moved to prisons or concentration camps as well. What made things even worse is the fact that the German government placed full blame on the Jews for the destructions and imposed a fine of one billion [[Reichsmark]] on the Jewish community. The government also took away all insurance payouts that would go to the Jews whose businesses or homes got destroyed. This left the Jews responsible for the costs of all repairs.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

This led to many decrees in the weeks following. These decrees were designed to deprive the Jews of their means of living. Many of these movements enforced [[Aryanization (Nazism)|"Aryanization"]] policy. This meant that Jewish-owned property would be transferred to "Aryan" ownership for a fraction of the true value. To further remove the Jews from public life, the Jews were expelled from attending German schools, and they lost the right to have a driver's license or own an automobile.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Kristallnacht was essentially the turning point in the Nazis persecution of the Jewish people. It expanded the efforts to remove Jews from German economic and social life. It also led to forced emigration of Jews in order to make Germany free of Jews.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Kristallnacht and the events that followed it showed the Nazi regime that they could count on the nationwide support of anti-Semitism from the general public. This showed the Nazis that they could easily move forward with their plans without much opposition from within Germany. The events of Kristallnacht foreshadowed the Holocaust and mass murders of the Jewish people.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Timeline of anti-Jewish legislation and movements in pre-war Germany ==
During the pre-war Nazi Germany period (1933-1939) there were more than 400 laws, decrees and other type of regulations whose goal was to restrict Jews. There were national laws that affected all Jews, and there were state, region and city laws that only affected the Jews in those communities. These regulations limited Jews in all aspects of life, both public and private. Almost all people were involved in the support of anti-Jewish legislation in some way, whether it was passive agreement or direct involvement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005681|title=ANTI-JEWISH LEGISLATION IN PRE-WAR GERMANY|last=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|first=|date=|website=Holocaust Encyclopedia|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These movements were all part of Hitler's intention and plan to rid the planet of all Jewish population. Hitler's plan started with stripping all Jews of their basic rights, before moving into the mass murdering of the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Steven|year=1994|title=ideas made the Holocaust- The Holocaust in Historical Context: The Holocaust and Mass Death before the Modern Age|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/210394559/|journal=Commonweal|volume=1|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* March 24: The Enabling Act was passed. This act brought an end to democracy in Germany. It gave the government the power to govern legislation by decree. It gave them the legal right to make discriminatory policies in the future. Hitler was allowed to make laws that violated the Weimar constitution without the approval of the parliament or Reich President with this act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007892|title=The Enabling Act|last=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|first=|date=|website=Holocaust Encyclopedia|publisher=|access-date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* March 31: A decree in the city of Berlin said that Jewish doctors were suspended from the city's charity services.
* April 7: There was a law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service. This law removed all Jews from government service. Also, a law on the Admission to the Legal Profession forbade the Jews from taking the bar exam, which is a test needed to become a lawyer.
* April 25: A law about over-crowded Schools and Universities limited the number of Jewish students allowed in public schools. The number of Jewish students in one school was limited to no more than 5% of the total population. The schools helped to spread Hitler's ideas. They taught students to love Hitler and to obey the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805217/73089/excerpt/9780521773089_excerpt.pdf|title=Introduction: Anti-Semitism in Europe Before the Holocaust|last=Brustein|first=William|date=|website=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|access-date=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* July 14: The Jewish people lost citizenship because of a De-Naturalization Law. This took citizenship away from all Jews, including naturalized Jews and "undesirables".
* October 4: The Jews were banned from editorial posts by a law on editors. 
'''1934:''' &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* The national Nazi Government forbade Jewish actors from performing on the stage or the screen.
* Local governments issued regulations on other aspects of Jewish life. The Jews were no longer allowed to slaughter animals, which prevented them from obeying Jewish dietary laws. 
'''1935:'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9890">{{nihongo|'''Attorneys at foreign law'''|外国法事務弁護士|gaikokuhō jimu bengoshi}}, or {{nihongo|''gaiben''|外弁}} for short, are [[lawyer]]s from foreign countries licensed to practice law in [[Japan]].

The term ''gaiben'' is composed of the characters for {{nihongo|外|gai}}, defined as "outside, without"&lt;ref&gt;Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary, 4th Ed. p305&lt;/ref&gt; and {{nihongo|弁|ben}}", defined as speech, tongue".&lt;ref&gt;Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary, 4th Ed. p 81&lt;/ref&gt;  Two authoritative translations of the term are Registered Foreign Lawyers &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/information/gjb-01.html Gaikokuho-Jimu-Bengoshi] (Ministry of Justice)&lt;/ref&gt; (RFL), or Foreign Special Members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/en/about/gaiben_info.html Information for Gaikokuho-Jimu-Bengoshi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313191928/http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/en/about/gaiben_info.html |date=March 13, 2007 }} (Japan Federation of Bar Associations)&lt;/ref&gt;  The colloquial term gaiben is often used by individuals, but is not determinative.

==Qualification==

Before becoming a ''gaiben'', a lawyer must:

* be admitted to the bar in a foreign jurisdiction,
* have at least three years of experience practicing law in that jurisdiction (one year of which may be spent working in Japan), and
* show that reciprocity exists with their home jurisdiction&amp;mdash;''i.e.'', that a Japanese attorney could become similarly qualified to practice there (this condition is waived for lawyers admitted in [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] member states).

A 13-member screening committee of the Japan Federation of Bar Associations reviews each application, a process which usually takes several months. Upon approval, the lawyer's official title becomes "Attorney at Foreign Law for ''[state]''," with their home jurisdiction filled in.

==Occupation==
By law, ''gaiben'' can only give advice pertaining to the law of their home jurisdiction, and cannot draft legal documents or represent Japanese clients in intrastate matters or probate matters without the assistance of a qualified ''[[bengoshi]]'' ([[attorney at law (Japan)|attorney at law]]). They are also prohibited from representing clients in courtroom [[litigation]], although they may represent clients in private [[arbitration]]. As a result, they are generally involved in intermediating between foreign clients and Japanese lawyers, intermediating between foreign and Japanese clients, or assisting Japanese clients with foreign legal matters.

Several thousand foreign-qualified lawyers, many of them Japanese nationals, work in Japan as employees of law firms or corporate legal departments without being admitted as ''gaiben''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXNASFS1202F_S0A410C1MM8000/|title=外国法の弁護士、活動容易に　法務省方針、企業の国際化に対応|last=|first=|date=April 13, 2010|website=|publisher=The Nikkei|access-date=2016-12-23|quote=日本の弁護士資格はないが、外国で弁護士資格を取って、弁護士法人や民間企業に所属し、外国法に関するサービスを提供する人は数千人程度いるとされる。}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, there are several legal benefits to qualifying as a ''gaiben'':

* They may open their own {{nihongo|offices|外国法事務弁護士事務所|gaikokuhō jimu bengoshi jimusho|sometimes abbreviated "GJBJ"}}.
* They may become partners in Japanese law firms. ''Gaiben'' offices may also enter [[joint venture]]s with Japanese law firms; several major U.S. and British law firms have structured their Tokyo operations in this manner, notably [[Baker &amp; McKenzie]] and [[White &amp; Case]].
* They may enter Japan on special "attorney" [[Visa (document)|visa]]s, which permit them to sponsor the visas of others. Non-gaiben attorneys must enter Japan as general professionals sponsored by a law firm or company.

The main drawback to qualifying as a ''gaiben'' is the cost of Japanese bar association membership, which is often over ¥60,000 per month.

As of June 2013 there were 363 ''gaiben'' registered in Japan, almost all of whom were registered with one of the three Tokyo bar associations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/jfba_info/membership/about.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The main jurisdictions of admission were [[New York (state)|New York]] (102), [[England and Wales]] (60), [[California]] (45), the [[People's Republic of China]] (29), [[New South Wales]] (16) and [[Hawaii]] (14).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/bar_search/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424191703/http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/bar_search/ |archivedate=2013-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Foreign lawyers were allowed to practice with varying restrictions in Japan from 1876 until 1955. Prior to 1949, their practice was limited to cases involving foreigners or international matters.&lt;ref name="kigawa"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kigawa|first1=S|title=Foreign Lawyers in Japan|journal=Southern California Law Review|date=1989|volume=62|pages=1490–99, 1503–06|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=OohyicuN-GIC&amp;lpg=PA334&amp;ots=_fZQlOo_Rb&amp;dq=junkaiin&amp;pg=PA337#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1949 until 1955, foreign lawyers were allowed to practice both Japanese and foreign law by registering with the [[Supreme Court of Japan]], and were even allowed to litigate in cases involving foreign aliens. Although this system ended in 1955, lawyers already registered under the system, known as ''junkaiin'' or "quasi-members" of the bar, were allowed to continue practicing. The ''junkaiin'' played a major role in Japan's international trade during the following decades, and trained many Japanese lawyers in the area of international business transactions.&lt;ref name="kigawa" /&gt; It was also common for foreign lawyers to serve as "trainees" in Japanese law firms, effectively practicing foreign law under the supervision of a Japanese-qualified attorney.&lt;ref name="pardieck"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pardieck|first1=Andrew|title=Foreign Legal Consultants|journal=Global Legal Studies Journal|date=1 April 1996|volume=3|issue=2|pages=468–472|url=http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1077&amp;context=ijgls|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, [[Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy]] became the first foreign law firm to establish an office in Tokyo under its own name, amid opposition from both the Ministry of Justice and Japan Federation of Bar Associations, who viewed it as illegal for foreign lawyers to practice in Japan.&lt;ref name="shimojo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shimojo|first1=Masahiro|title=日本の外国弁護士受入制度の返還|url=http://www.moj.go.jp/content/000004520.pdf|accessdate=23 January 2015|date=December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these protests, Milbank's office remained open through the early 1980s, and along with the office of a Hong Kong-based firm, was the only office of a foreign law firm in Japan during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An American Lawyer in Tokyo|journal=UCLA Pacific Basin Law Journal|date=1983|volume=2|page=180|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/99j1s132#page-1|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States government began to view the restrictions on foreign lawyers as a [[trade barrier]] during the early 1980s, and in 1984, the Japan Federation of Bar Associations exchanged proposals with the American Bar Association regarding a new foreign lawyer registration system.&lt;ref name="kigawa" /&gt;

The initial ''gaiben'' law, effective in 1987, allowed foreign lawyers with requisite work experience to practice foreign law in Japan, but prohibited employment of, or partnership with, Japanese attorneys, and also prohibited the use of any firm name other than the foreign lawyer's own name. A revised law enacted in 1994 made it possible to establish fee-sharing (but not profit-sharing) "joint enterprises" between ''gaiben'' and local lawyers.&lt;ref name="pardieck" /&gt; Further revisions in 2003 removed the prohibitions on employment of Japanese attorneys and allowed profit-sharing joint ventures between foreign and Japanese attorneys.&lt;ref name="shimojo" /&gt;

The interpretation of the licensing requirements has varied between firms over time, and not all foreign lawyers in Japan are registered. In 2005, the Japan Federation of Bar Associations circulated a letter requesting that all foreign partners in law firms in Japan register as ''gaiben''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/library/ja/committee/list/data/050909.pdf|title=日弁連審363号|last=|first=|date=September 9, 2005|website=|publisher=Japan Federation of Bar Associations|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 2009 by a similar letter requesting that all foreign attorneys providing legal services in Japan be registered as ''gaiben'', regardless of their title within their firm;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202428161789/Japanese-Crack-Down-on-Unregistered-Foreign-Associates?slreturn=20161123080656|title=Japanese Crack Down on Unregistered Foreign Associates|last=Lin|first=Anthony|date=February 11, 2009|work=|newspaper=The American Lawyer|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the JFBA later clarified that this was not intended to impose new requirements but rather to remind firms of existing requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://practicesource.com/japans-bar-association-denies-crackdown-on-foreign-lawyers/|title=Japan’s Bar Association Denies Crackdown On Foreign Lawyers|date=2009-02-16|newspaper=Practice Source|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=August 2009}}
A '''bailiwick''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|l|ᵻ|w|ɪ|k}} is usually the area of [[jurisdiction]] of a [[bailiff]], and once also applied to territories in which a privately appointed bailiff exercised the [[sheriff]]'s functions under a royal or imperial [[writ]]. The word is now more generally used in a [[metaphor]]ical sense, to indicate a sphere of authority, experience, activity, study, or interest. A bailiwick ({{lang-de|“Ballei”}}) was also the territorial division of the [[Teutonic Order]]. Here, various [[Komtur|“Komtur(en)”]] formed a ''Ballei'' province.

The term survives in administrative usage in the British [[Crown dependencies]] of the [[Channel Islands]], which are grouped for administrative purposes into two bailiwicks — Jersey (comprising the island of [[Jersey]] and uninhabited islets such as the [[Minquiers]] and [[Écréhous]]) and Guernsey (comprising the islands of [[Guernsey]], [[Sark]], [[Alderney]], [[Brecqhou]], [[Herm]], [[Jethou]] and [[Lihou]]). A [[Bailiff (Channel Islands)|Bailiff]] heads each Channel Island bailiwick.

==Origin==
The term originated in [[France]] (''[[bailie]]'' being the [[Old French]] term for a bailiff). Under the [[ancien régime]] in France, the '''bailli''' was the king's representative in a '''bailliage''', charged with the application of justice and control of the administration. In southern France, the term generally used was '''sénéchal''' (cf [[seneschal]]) who held office in the '''sénéchaussée'''. The administrative network of ''baillages'' was established in the 13th century, based on the earlier medieval fiscal and tax divisions (the 'baillie') which had been used by earlier sovereign princes. (For more on this French judicial system, see [[bailli]], [[prévôt]] and [[Early Modern France]].)

In English, the original French ''bailie'' combined with '-wic', the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] suffix (meaning a village) to produce a term meaning literally 'bailiff's village'—the original geographic scope of a bailiwick. In the 19th century, it was absorbed into [[American English]] as a metaphor for a sphere of knowledge or activity.

==Bailiwick of Bicester Market End==
At Bicester in [[Oxfordshire]], the lord of the manor of Market End was the [[Earl of Derby]] who, in 1597, sold a 9,999 year lease to 31 principal tenants. This in effect gave the manorial rights to the leaseholders, ‘purchased for the benefit of those inhabitants or others who might hereafter obtain parts of the demesne’. The leaseholders elected a bailiff to receive the profits from the bailiwick, mainly from the administration of the market and distribute them to the shareholders. From the bailiff’s title, the arrangement became known as the Bailiwick of Bicester Market End. By 1752 all of the original leases were in the hands of ten men, who leased the bailiwick control of the market to two local tradesmen.

'''''Betancourt v. Trinitas Hospital''''' is a [[New Jersey]] legal case concerning whether a hospital may unilaterally refuse care to a patient on the grounds that it is futile to prolong the person's life because there is little chance that the condition will improve.  It has become the focal point of the ongoing debate surrounding denial of care among professional [[bioethicists]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703340904575285121097569484?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_newyork Court Weighs Death Decision], ''The Wall Street Journal'', June 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==

Ruben Betancourt of [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]] was a 73-year-old retired machinist who suffered from [[encephalopathy|anoxic encephalopathy]], a form of brain damage, following successful thoracic surgery for a thymus gland tumor at [[Trinitas Hospital|Trinitas Regional Medical Center]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  His doctors determined that he was in a [[persistent vegetative state]], removed his dialysis port, and sought to impose a [[do not resuscitate]] order on him.  In response to this decision, Betancourt's daughter went to court and sought [[legal guardianship]] of her father.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  The hospital, which is affiliated with the [[Catholic Church]], opposed her petition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703340904575285121097569484?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_newyork Court Weighs Death Decision], 'The Wall Street Journal, June 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  In court papers, Trinitas argued that "Mr. Betancourt is dying...and that dying is being prolonged by the treatment rendered."  A trial court ruled in favor of Betancourt's daughter, finding that she was unquestionably a loving, appropriate guardian, and was also the unanimous choice of her family.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thaddeuspope.com/images/Betancourt_v_trinitas_3-4_2_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;   The hospital appealed the court's decision.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  In contrast, Betancourt's daughter does not accept this diagnosis. "My father would turn his head," she told an interviewer. "One time I was joking, my father started laughing. How can you tell me a person like that is nonresponsive?".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  When asked if Betancourt was suffering pain, a Trinitas doctor answered, "I know it.  I've seen it."  This calls the diagnosis into question, as pain is not consistent with the diagnosis of persistent vegetative state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medicalfutility.blogspot.com/2009/10/betancourt-v-trinitas-not-dead-yet.html|title=Betancourt v. Trinitas -- Not Dead Yet Amicus Brief|publisher=|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Betancourt died in May 2009.  On Friday, August 13th, the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey issued their opinion in Betancourt v. Trinitas. In essence the court ruled that because Mr. Betancourt had died, the issue was now moot. Thus they neither support the plaintiff’s nor the defendant’s positions.

==Law and ethics==

According to Sam Germana, vice president and general counsel for Trinitas, the hospital's ethics committee met multiple times to evaluate Betancourt's case. "Our doctors usually err on the side of doing anything," he told the press. "It's extremely rare when they say 'enough is enough, we're just keeping organs alive."  At the time of the committee meetings, Betancourt's care had directly cost the hospital, by its own estimate, $1.6 million.&lt;ref name="thaddeuspope.com"&gt;http://thaddeuspope.com/images/Betancourt_NJHA_CHP_MSNJ_amicus_small_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The case had become a cause celebre for both supporters and opponents of the right of patients, and their surrogate decision-makers, to choose whether to discontinue life-sustaining medical treatment. Among those who had taken the hospital's side are the New Jersey Hospital Association, the Medical Society of New Jersey, and the Catholic Healthcare Partnership of New Jersey.&lt;ref name="thaddeuspope.com"/&gt;  These organizations have argued that unconscious, elderly, or terminally ill patients do not have an "unfettered" right to choose whether their lives will be sustained.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  They also argued that hospitals have a duty to conserve their limited resources for all patients.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

The family has received support from a prominent authority on medical futility, [[Thaddeus Mason Pope]], and conservative commentator [[Wesley J. Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://medicalfutility.blogspot.com/2009/03/new-case-betancourt-v-trinitas-regional.html] New Case -- Betancourt v. Trinitas Regional Medical Hospital  March 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/secondhandsmoke/2009/03/17/defeat-for-futile-care-in-new-jersey/ Defeat for Futile Care in New Jersey], March 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith has written:  "If the hospital won the case, doctors and bioethicists would, in effect, have been given the right to declare that the life of a patient diagnosed in a PVS is futile, and once that principle became well established in law and medical ethics, such ad hoc health care rationing wouldn’t end with catastrophically ill people such as this patient."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In explaining its reasoning for dismissing the case as moot, the court stated:

"Courts normally will not decide issues when a controversy no longer exists, and the disputed issues have become moot…" "A critical factor in the mootness analysis is whether the unusual circumstances of a case make a recurrence of this specific set of facts unlikely. This is the decisive issue here." 

The Court opined that it is up to legislature to handle the issues raised by the case:  

"While we dismiss the appeal, we do not see our declination to resolve the issue on this record and in this case to be an end to the debate. The issues presented are profound and universal in application. They warrant thoughtful study and debate not in the context of overheated rhetoric in the battlefield of active litigation, such as marked the Schiavo debate, but in thoughtful consideration by the Legislature well as Executive agencies and Commissions charged with developing the policies that impact on the lives of all."

A '''calligraphus''' (pl. ''calligraphi'') was an ancient [[copyist]] or [[scrivener]], who transcribed correctly and in its entirety what the [[Notary public|notaries]] had taken down in notes, or minutes—duties similar to the modern work of engrossing.

The minutes of acts, etc., were always taken down in a kind of [[cipher]], or [[shorthand]], so that the ''Notaries'', as the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] called them, or the ''{{lang|grc|Σημειόγραφοι}}'' and ''{{lang|grc|Ταχύγραφοι}}'', as the [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]] called them, could keep pace with a speaker or person who dictated. These notes being understood by few, were copied exactly by people with good handwriting; these were called ''calligraphi'', a name often found in ancient writings.

Brown''' (1839–?) was an American educator and [[Civil and political rights|civil rights activist]] who was one of the first to legally challenge [[racial segregation in the United States]] when she filed a lawsuit against a streetcar company in [[San Francisco]] in the 1860s after she was forcibly removed from a segregated streetcar.

==Family and early life==

[[File:Pioneers of Negro Origin cropped Cover.jpg|thumb|220px|Cover of Pioneers of Negro Origin in California, by Sue Bailey Thurman]]

Brown was born in [[Maryland]] in 1839, the daughter of James E Brown, who was born [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved,]] and Charlotte Brown, a free seamstress. The elder Charlotte Brown purchased her husband's freedom and in 1850 they were living as [[Free people of color]] in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, with several children, including Charlotte.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Elinson, [http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/San-Francisco-s-own-Rosa-Parks-2554060.php San Francisco's own Rosa Parks, San Francisco Chronicle, January 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1850 Census, Baltimore, Maryland, Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt; Some time between 1850 and 1860 they moved their family to San Francisco, which was booming as a result of the [[California Gold Rush]], and became a part of that city's burgeoning black middle class.&lt;ref&gt;1860 Census, San Francisco, California, Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thurman, Sue Bailey.

==Streetcar incident==

[[File:Horse-drawn streetcar San Francisco 1860's.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Horse-drawn streetcar San Francisco 1860's]]

At 8PM on April 17, 1863, Charlotte Brown took a seat on a [[Horsecar|horse-drawn streetcar]] one block from her home on Filbert Street in San Francisco. She was on her way to see her doctor. The streetcar was owned by the Omnibus Railroad Company. When the streetcar conductor approached her and asked her to leave, Brown said she "had a right to ride" and had no intention of leaving the car.&lt;ref&gt;Giesburg, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

In her courtroom testimony, she stated:

"The conductor went around and collected tickets and when he came to me I handed him my ticket and he refused to take it. It was one of the Omnibus railroad tickets, one that I had purchased of them previous to that time. He replied that colored persons were not allowed to ride. I told him I had been in the habit of riding ever since the cars had been running. I answered that I had a great ways to go and I was later than I ought to be."&lt;ref&gt;Giesburg, p.160&lt;/ref&gt;

The conductor, Thomas Dennison, asked her several times to leave, and each time she refused. Finally, when a white woman objected to her presence, he grabbed her by the arm and escorted her off the car.&lt;ref&gt;Quintard Taylor, Shirley Ann Wilson Moore, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uwKuLlDDT-wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=african+american+women+confront+the+west&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_-4XNgI3OAhVD8WMKHTfsCtkQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=african%20american%20women%20confront%20the%20west&amp;f=false African American Women Confront the West, 1600-2000, University of Oklahoma Press, 2008], p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charlotte Brown vs. Omnibus Railroad==

[[File:Orville C. Pratt.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Judge Orville C. Pratt ruled in Brown's favor, calling streetcar segregation "a relic of barbarism"]]

Her father James E Brown hired attorney W. C. Burnett, and Charlotte Brown brought a lawsuit against the Omnibus Railroad Company for $200.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Elinson and Stan Yogi, [http://www.wherevertheresafight.com/excerpts/under_color_of_law_the_fight_for_racial_equality Wherever There’s a Fight: How Runaway Slaves, Suffragists, Immigrants, Strikers, and Poets Shaped Civil Liberties in California, Heyday Press, 2010, Chapter Four:Under Color of Law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quintard Taylor, Shirley Ann Wilson Moore, African American Women Confront the West, 1600-2000, University of Oklahoma Press, Aug 1, 2008, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pacific Appeal, Nov 21, 1863,&lt;/ref&gt; African Americans had just won the right to testify against whites that same year.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine, Elinson, San Francisco's Own Rosa Parks, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', January 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Omnibus Railroad argued that its conductor's action was justified because racial segregation protected white women and children who might be fearful or 'repulsed' by riding in the same car as African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Quintard and Moore p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Brown won her case, presided over by Judge Cowles, but the jury only awarded her twenty-five dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Pacific Appeal, June 26, 1863&lt;/ref&gt; The conductor, Dennison, was convicted in criminal court of assault and battery against Brown.&lt;ref&gt;Giesburg, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown's civil case was tied up in [[appeal]]s for the next two years. In one appeals trial, the jury awarded Brown only five cents, the price of the streetcar ticket.&lt;ref&gt;Sacramento Daily Union, November 14, 1863&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, just three days after the first trial, Brown was ejected from yet another streetcar and brought a second suit against Omnibus, this time for $3,000.&lt;ref&gt;Quintard Taylor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=W-iKAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=Quintard+Taylor+In+Search+of+the+Racial+Frontier+Charlotte+Brown&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp4t3xgo3OAhUD5GMKHVoWA5kQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Quintard%20Taylor%20In%20Search%20of%20the%20Racial%20Frontier%20Charlotte%20Brown&amp;f=false In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West , W. W. Norton &amp; Company,  1999], p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in October, 1864, her case was tried in a higher court. In his judgment of October 5, 1864, Judge [[Orville C. Pratt]] of the 12th District Court upheld the earlier verdict in favor of Brown, ruling that excluding passengers from streetcars because of their race was illegal. He had no desire, he said in his ruling, to "perpetuate a relic of barbarism":

"It has been already quite too long tolerated by the dominant race to see with indifference the negro or mulatto treated as a brute, insulted, wronged, enslaved, made to wear a yoke, to tremble before white men, to serve him as a tool, to hold property and life at his will, to surrender to him his intellect and conscience, and to seal his lips and belie his thought through dread of the white man's power", Judge Pratt stated.&lt;ref&gt;lElaine Elinson and Stan Yogi, Wherever There’s a Fight: How Runaway Slaves, Suffragists, Immigrants, Strikers, and Poets Shaped Civil Liberties in California, Chapter Four, Heyday Press, 2010, Chapter Four&lt;/ref&gt;

In January, 1865, a jury awarded Brown $500.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, In Search of the Racial Frontier, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; The Omnibus Railroad Company appealed the verdict but was refused another trial.&lt;ref&gt;Giesburg, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public reaction==

[[File:Charlotte Brown Editorial Cartoon.jpg|350px|thumb|Racist editorial cartoon published in 1864 after Charlotte Brown won a lawsuit against a segregated San Francisco streetcar company]]

After the first trial, [[African-American newspapers|the black-owned newspaper]] the ''Pacific Appeal'' noted that the verdict in her favor "establishes the right, by law, of colored persons to ride in such conveyances".

"While the law recognizes and gives us the right to ride in such conveyances," the editorial continued, "there are a certain number of the employees of this Company, who, if a colored person attempts to cross the street while their car is passing, are seized with a sudden fit of Negrophobia, which is generally manifested by pulling their alarm bell violently, as if some danger was imminent, so afraid are they that some other of our respectable females might attempt to exercise the right that Miss Brown has just won. So long as we have law, justice and right on our side, we want no pity."&lt;ref&gt;Pacific Appeal, Number 34, November 1863&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Pratt's 1864 ruling was derided in an editorial cartoon by a local white-owned newspaper that showed blacks and whites riding side by side. Using a racial epithet, it accused Pratt of being partial to African Americans, and questioned whether the light-skinned Brown was really black, or just filing suit for the monetary award.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor and Moore, African-American Women Confront the West, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; A white editor of ''The Sacramento Daily Union'', on the other hand, said of Pratt's decision, "his argument is lucid, and his decision, we believe, chimes in with the sentiment of the people".&lt;ref&gt;Sacramento Daily Union, Volume 28, Number 4225, 5 October 1864&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charlotte Brown case paved the way for other cases brought by San Francisco African Americans like William Bowen and [[Mary Ellen Pleasant]] that challenged the "whites-only" practices of the privately owned streetcars.&lt;ref&gt;Elinson, Elaine, "San Francisco's Own Rosa Parks" San Francisco Chronicle, January 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Lynn Marie, [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Making_of_Mammy_Pleasant.html?id=S2YvRVIou3cC The Making of "Mammy Pleasant": A Black Entrepreneur in Nineteenth-century, University of Illinois Press], p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 streetcar segregation was officially outlawed on statewide streetcars by the California legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Giesburg, p 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Degraaf and Taylor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qa_tAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=Seeking+El+Dorado+Charlotte+Brown&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sQzcLJNKQk&amp;sig=G1MO6ZXUF1tpFakp-Fk-M0XP6RI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi15-X7hY3OAhVK3WMKHcWMDjsQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Seeking%20El%20Dorado%20Charlotte%20Brown&amp;f=false Seeking El Dorado], African Americans in California, University of Washington Press, 2001, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

After Charlotte Brown won her case, Senator [[Charles Sumner]] invoked the case in [[United States Congress|Congress]] as setting an important precedent for racial equality when he argued in favor of integrating streetcars in [[Washington, D.C.|the nation's capitol]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_zTqCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA544&amp;lpg=PA544&amp;dq=journal+of+the+civil+war+era+charlotte+brown&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jidsmI_QG8&amp;sig=nKTqk0UPyjMCYqMMUpp02jaRmg8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9s8aDh43OAhUBTGMKHSh1BPEQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=journal%20of%20the%20civil%20war%20era%20charlotte%20brown&amp;f=false Journal of the Civil War Era: Winter 2011 Issue], p 544&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

[[File:Sepia Palace-Hotel-black-workers-1882-from-Bonanza-Inn.jpg|thumb|Brown's husband James Riker worked at San Francisco's Palace Hotel]]

In 1867, Charlotte Brown opened a school for young children at 10 Scotland Street in San Francisco, offering "all the branches of primary education" as well as music and embroidery.&lt;ref&gt;Pacific Appeal, Elevator, Number 14, 5 July 1867&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, she married James Henry Riker,&lt;ref&gt;The Elevator,  January 27, 1874&lt;/ref&gt; another prominent African American activist of San Francisco, who had worked as a live-in personal servant to [[William Chapman Ralston]] and was employed as a steward at the [[Palace Hotel, San Francisco|Palace Hotel]] during their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Herald, Vol 11, Number 128, 30 April 1879&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elevator, No. 15, 14 July 1865&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elevator, Number 52, 4 April 1874&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1870 Census, San Francisco, Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;California Voter Registration Lists 1870 and 1880, Ancestry.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Riker, along with Brown's father, was one of the organizers of the 1865 California State Convention of Colored Citizens.&lt;ref&gt;The Elevator, June 16, 1865&lt;/ref&gt; The society pages of the black newspaper ''The Elevator'' printed an announcement in 1877 of a surprise party for a fellow steward at the Palace Hotel that was given by Charlotte and James H Riker in their residence on 1018 Powell Street in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Elevator, Number 52, 31 March 1877&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about Charlotte Brown Riker's life after that time.

==Historical context==

[[File:Rosa parks human rights museum memphis 2.jpg|thumb|left|Image of Rosa Parks from Memphis Civil Rights Museum]]

The Charlotte Brown lawsuit was one of the first of several actions that were brought by black activists in both [[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Northern United States|Northern]] cities throughout the United States to protest exclusion and [[Segregation in the United States|segregation]] on public transportation in the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Blair L. M. Kelley. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Right_to_Ride.html?id=Rt8jwoFxsxEC Right to Ride: Streetcar Boycotts and African American Citizenship in the Era of Plessy v. Ferguson]. John Hope Franklin Series in African American History and Culture. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, [[Elizabeth Jennings Graham|Elizabeth Jennings]] successfully filed suit against the Third Avenue Railway Company in [[New York City]] after she had been ejected from a streetcar there because of her skin color.&lt;ref&gt;Greider, Katharine, '[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/13/nyregion/thecity/the-schoolteacher-on-the-streetcar.html?_r=0 'The Schoolteacher and the Streetcar,'' The New York Times, Nov 13, 2005'']&lt;/ref&gt; In Philadelphia in 1865, a "Mrs. Derry" won a civil suit and $50 in damages after a streetcar conductor threw her off the bus and kicked her when she and a group of women were returning from tending to Civil War soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Giesburg, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Sojourner Truth]], [[Ida B. Wells]], and [[Frances Harper|Frances Watkins Parker]] also lobbied actively for streetcar integration after being refused ridership on streetcars in Washington, D.C., Memphis, and Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saintssistersandsluts.com/10-women-who-refused-to-give-up-their-seats-before-rosa-parks/ Ten Women Who Refused to Give Up Their Seats Before Rosa Parks]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though streetcars in the north were largely de-segregated by the end of the 19th century, segregation on public transportation [[Plessy v. Ferguson|became the official policy]] in many cities of the South.&lt;ref&gt;Blair L. M. Kelley. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Right_to_Ride.html?id=Rt8jwoFxsxEC Right to Ride: Streetcar Boycotts and African American Citizenship in the Era of Plessy v. Ferguson]. John Hope Franklin Series in African American History and Culture. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, women like [[Irene Morgan]] and [[Mary Louise Smith (civil rights activist)|Mary Louise Smith]] continued to battle segregation on public transportation. In 1954, [[Rosa Parks]] challenged the practice in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], launching a [[Montgomery bus boycott|citywide bus boycott]] and helping to start the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and '60s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/rosa-parks&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''African American Women Confront the West'', scholars Quintard Taylor and Shirley Ann Wilson Moore analyze the Charlotte Brown case and other 19th-century streetcar desegregation lawsuits brought by black women as they relate historically to both race and gender. They noted that it was frequently women who filed these lawsuits because of prevailing ideas of public vs. private space, and white views of black gender roles:

"Activist black men were keenly aware of the power of black women to go, where they, as men, could not," they write. "Relying on the wedge of gender, black women's lawsuits against streetcar companies ultimately assured the right to travel of blacks generally ... the declaration of law was a general one that applied not simply to Charlotte Brown or to Mary Pleasant, but to all blacks as well."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor and Moore, p.80&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''civil wrong''' or '''wrong''' is a [[cause of action]] under the law of the governing body. [[Tort]],&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Williams. Learning the Law. Eleventh Edition. Stevens. 1982. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; breach of contract&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Williams. Learning the Law. Eleventh Edition. Stevens. 1982. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and breach of trust&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Williams. Learning the Law. Eleventh Edition. Stevens. 1982. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more information on breach of trust, which does not yet have an article, see [[English trusts law#Breach of trust]]&lt;/ref&gt; are types of civil wrong. Something that amounts to a civil wrong is said to be '''wrongful'''. A wrong involves the violation of a right because wrong and right are complementary terms.&lt;ref&gt;Clerk and Lindsell on Torts. Sixteenth Edition. 1989. Sweet and Maxwell. paragraph 1-14 at page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; A statement that an act complained of is legally wrongful as regards the party complaining implicitly includes a statement that the act complained of prejudicially affects the party complaining in some [[legal right]].&lt;ref&gt;Rogers v Rajendro Dutt (1860) 13 Moo P C 209, 9 WR 149, 15 [[English Reports|ER]] 78. The text reads: "It is essential to an action in tort that the act complained of should under the circumstances be legally wrongful as regards the party complaining; that is, it must prejudicially affect him in some legal right;"&lt;/ref&gt;

The law that relates to civil wrongs is part of the branch of the law that is called the [[civil law (common law)|civil law]].&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Williams. Learning the Law. Eleventh Edition. Stevens. 1982. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; A civil wrong is capable of being followed by what are called [[civil proceeding]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Williams. Learning the Law. Eleventh Edition. Stevens. 1982. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; It is a misnomer to describe a civil wrong as a "[[civil offence]]".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, G.L., (1982). "[[Learning the Law]]", 11th Ed., London : Stevens, {{ISBN|0-420-46290-2}}, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The law of England recognised the concept of a "wrong" before it recognised the distinction between civil wrongs and [[crime]]s (which distinction was developed during the thirteenth century).&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Hood Phillips|O. Hood Phillips]], [[A First Book of English Law]], Sweet and Maxwell, 4th ed., 1960, pp. 207, 208, 213&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Colorado Rangers''' Law Enforcement Shared Reserve (also known as the “Colorado Rangers” or "CLER") is an all-volunteer law enforcement agency providing state certified reserve peace officers to assist local law enforcement agencies upon their request.  It is the successor agency to the Colorado Mounted Rangers, the latter still existing as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.  The Rangers are the oldest statewide [[law enforcement]] organization in [[Colorado]], originally organized in 1861 by the [[Colorado Territory]].

==Early history==

The Rangers trace their roots to the Jefferson Rangers, keeping the peace in the unofficial [[Jefferson Territory]] during the [[Pikes Peak Gold Rush]].&lt;ref name="CMR History"/&gt;

When the [[Colorado Territory]] was established in 1861, they were reorganized as the Colorado Rangers, continuing to serve as Colorado's only statewide [[law enforcement agency]] through the 1920s.  The Colorado Rangers were fashioned after the well known [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] and served as both law enforcement and state militia.&lt;ref name="CMR History"&gt;{{cite book |last=McClure |first=Carleton E. |date=1982 |title=History of the Colorado Mounted Rangers |location=Colorado Springs |publisher=Minute Man Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
[[File:Glorietapass.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.50|Marker at Glorietta Pass]]
The Colorado Rangers often fought on horseback with repeating revolvers and were instrumental in the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]], helping to stop the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] advance towards the Colorado gold fields.  This battle has become known as the "[[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] of the West" for its importance to the Union victory.&lt;ref name="CMR History"/&gt;

After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the Colorado Rangers returned to their law enforcement duties.  From time to time the Rangers were also called upon by Colorado's governors to keep the peace during times of [[civil unrest]], [[natural disaster]]s, and during disputes such as the violent [[Colorado Labor Wars|Labor Wars]] in Colorado's [[mining]] towns.&lt;ref name="CMR History"/&gt; The Rangers were also present at the Columbine mine massacre in 1927. The Rangers were accused of firing machine guns into the crowds of miners during the shooting, which was disputed by the Rangers.
 
Rangers were also utilized by Denver District Attorney [[Philip Van Cise]] to break up [[organized crime]] and [[corruption]] in [[Denver]]'s City Hall in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name="CMR History"/&gt;

In 1922 Van Cise set up an independent investigation of the Blonger gang, secretly funded by a group of wealthy Denver citizens.  On August 24 of that year, Van Cise used a special force of Colorado Rangers to capture 33 suspects in a single day.  Fearing that the [[Denver]] Police would tip off the gang once the first suspect was taken to jail, Van Cise detained the gang members in the basement of the First Universalist Church, where he was a member, until the sweep was complete.  In Colorado's longest and most expensive trial to that time, 20 [[Conman|con men]], including [[Lou Blonger]], was convicted and sent to prison, effectively busting the "Million-Dollar Bunco Ring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=About Col. Philip S. Van Cise| url=http://www.blongerbros.com/vancise/bio.asp| website=Blonger Bros.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of a campaign promise to [[organized labor]] and other interests, Governor [[William E. Sweet]] signed an [[executive order]] on January 29, 1923, cutting off funding to the Rangers.&lt;ref name="CMR History"/&gt;  The Colorado Rangers were officially disbanded by the Colorado General Assembly on April 1, 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Colorado Rangers, Abolishment| date=1 April 1927| url=http://lawcollections.colorado.edu/allfile/260137.pdf| website=William A. Wise Law Library| accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This left Colorado without statewide police protection until 1935 when the Colorado State Highway Courtesy Patrol (later becoming the [[Colorado State Patrol]]) was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Highway Patrol, Created and Established| date=10 April 1935| url=http://lawcollections.colorado.edu/allfile/305711.pdf| website=William A. Wise Law Library| accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reorganization==


===1941 reorganization===
[[Teller Ammons|Governor Teller Ammons]] re-organized the Colorado Rangers as the [[Colorado Mounted Rangers]], an all [[Volunteering|volunteer]] law enforcement organization. On February 21, 1941, they were formally incorporated with a single Troop of 50 Rangers headquartered in [[Bailey, Colorado|Bailey]].&lt;ref name="CMR History"/&gt;

===1955 reorganization===
In 1955 with a growing role in [[civil defense]] and under the guidance of [[Teller County, Colorado|Teller County]] Sheriff Rufus Jones, the Colorado Mounted Rangers expanded the organization forming a squadron of Troops located throughout the state.  Troops partnered with local Law Enforcement agencies in their area to provide them with additional peace officers when needed.&lt;ref name="CMR History"/&gt;
[[File:Rangers provide local Law Enforcement agencies with additional Peace Officers.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1|Colorado Mounted Ranger on duty]]

===2017 reorganization===
In 2017, the [[Colorado Mounted Rangers]] began to transition their membership back into service as a governmental law enforcement agency.&lt;ref name="IGA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Approval of Intergovernmental Agreement with the Colorado Rangers Shared Reserve |url=https://www.fortluptonco.gov/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Item/1719?fileID=12219 |website=City of Fort Lupton Colorado |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of municipal law enforcement agencies from around Colorado's front range established the Colorado Rangers Law Enforcement Shared Reserve (abbreviated as "CLER" and officially still known as the "Colorado Rangers") by intergovernmental agreement to provide reserve peace officers certified by Colorado P.O.S.T. to carry on the law enforcement support role of the Colorado Mounted Rangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Local Government Filings |url=https://dola.colorado.gov/dlg_portal/filings.jsf?id=66784 |website=Colorado Department of Local Affairs |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of this transition, the Colorado Mounted Rangers ceased their operational law enforcement auxiliary functions on July 15, 2018. The Colorado Mounted Rangers continue to exist as a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Summary |url=https://www.sos.state.co.us/biz/BusinessEntityDetail.do?quitButtonDestination=BusinessEntityResults&amp;nameTyp=ENT&amp;masterFileId=19871105986&amp;entityId2=19871105986&amp;fileId=19871105986&amp;srchTyp=ENTITY |website=Colorado Secretary of State |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Present day==
The Colorado Rangers continue their historical mission to provide local law enforcement agencies with trained and experienced personnel when needed.  All members of CLER serve as unpaid volunteers, and must supply most of their own equipment and uniforms.  As a consequence, CLER is able to provide its services with little financial obligation for requesting agencies. CLER activities include assisting with special events, responding to local emergencies, and providing patrol services when full time personnel are unavailable.

CLER currently has mutual aid agreements with 58 local law enforcement and other government agencies throughout Colorado.&lt;ref name="CLER Website"&gt;{{cite web |title=Colorado Rangers Law Enforcement Shared Reserve |url=https://coloradorangers.org |website=Colorado Rangers |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These agencies are often located in rural areas where maintaining a local reserve program would be difficult and expensive.

===Reserve academy===
The Colorado Rangers operate their own grant funded reserve law enforcement academy, approved by the Colorado Peace Officer Standards and Training Board.&lt;ref name="Reserve Academies"&gt;{{cite web |title=Reserve Academy |url=https://www.coloradopost.gov/academy/reserve-academy |website=Colorado POST |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CLER Website"/&gt;  Four Ranger academies are scheduled for 2018, with the first class graduated June 30, 2018.&lt;ref name="CLER Website"/&gt;

A '''creature of statute''' (also known as '''creature of the state''') is a legal entity, such as a [[corporation]], created by [[statute]]. Creatures of statute may include [[Municipality|municipalities]] and other artificial legal entities or relationships.&lt;ref name="quaqua1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quaqua.org/creature.htm |title=Creature of the State |website=Quaqua Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when a statute in some fashion requires the formation of a corporate body—often for governmental purposes—such bodies when formed are known as "creatures of statute." The same concept is also expressed with the phrase "creature of the state."&lt;ref name="quaqua1"/&gt;

The term "creature of statute" is most common to the [[United States]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], these bodies are simply called [[statutory corporation]]s (or statutory bodies) and generally have some governmental function. The [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] is an example. In a wider sense, most companies in the UK are created under statute since the [[Companies Act 1985]] specifies how a company may be created by a member of the public, but these companies are not called 'statutory corporations'. Often, in American legal and business documents that speak of governing bodies (''e.g.'', a board that governs small businesses in China) these bodies are described as "creatures of statute" to inform readers of their origins and format although the national governments that created them may not term them as creatures of statute. [[Australia]] also uses the term "creature of statute" to describe some governmental bodies.

The importance of a corporate body, regardless of its exact function, when such a body is a creature of statute is that its active functions can only be within the scope detailed by the statute which created that corporation. Thereby, the creature of statute is the tangible manifestation of the functions or work described by a given statute. The jurisdiction of a body that is a creature of statute is also therefore limited to the functional scope written into the laws that created that body. Unlike most (private) corporate bodies, creatures of statute cannot expand their business interests into other diverse areas.

[[File:Dekret kutnohorský.jpg|thumb|270px|Decree of Kutná Hora, deed issued on 18 September 1418 for Jan Hus]]
The '''Decree of Kutná Hora''' ({{lang-cs|Dekret Kutnohorský}}) or '''Decree of Kuttenberg''' ({{lang-de|Kuttenberger Dekret}}) was issued on 18 January 1409 in [[Kutná Hora]] (''Kuttenberg''), [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] by King [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia|Wenceslaus IV]] to give members of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian]] [[Nation (university)|nation]] a decisive voice in the affairs of the [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]].

Since the university was founded by King [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] in 1348, the ''[[studium generale]]'' was divided among Bohemian (including [[German language|German]]-speaking citizens), [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavarian]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxon]], and [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Polish]] "nations". From 1403 onwards, the religious [[Lollardy|Lollard movement]] and the doctrines of the [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] theologian [[John Wycliffe]] led to controversy at the Prague University. The Bohemian reformers around [[Jan Hus]] wanted to teach this new doctrine, but most [[Kingdom of Germany|German]] masters and professors voted against the new "[[Heresy|heretic]]" thinking. 
[[File:Auszug aus Prag 1409.jpg|thumb|left|German students leaving Prague for Leipzig (postcard, {{circa|1909}})]]
In anticipation of the [[Council of Pisa]], the three "foreign" nations (Poland, Bavaria and Saxony) at the university opposed the request of Wenceslaus to take a neutral attitude between the two rival popes in the [[Western Schism]]. Wenceslaus himself hoped for support of a new Pope to regain the [[King of the Romans|German kingship]] after his deposition by [[Rupert, King of Germany|Rupert of the Palatinate]] nine years before. However, King Rupert, relying on the support of [[Pope Gregory XII]] and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Prague|Prague]] archbishop [[Zbyněk Zajíc of Hazmburk]], pressured German teachers and students not to side with his Bohemian rival. 

A delegation led by [[Jerome of Prague]] went to Wenceslaus' court staying at the [[Royal cities|royal city]] of Kutná Hora (according to other sources at [[Točník Castle]]), where the king promised to change the constitution of the university. On 18 January 1409, he had the statutes amended: with his decree, he gave the Bohemian nation three votes and one vote each to the other three nations. Shortly after that, Hus himself became rector of the university, succeeding [[Johannes Hoffmann von Schweidnitz]]. As another result of the Decree of Kutná Hora, numerous German academics (about 80 percent of the teaching staff) and their students left the university. This exodus resulted in the foundation of the [[University of Leipzig]] in [[Margravate of Meissen|Meissen]], among others, and led to a considerable isolation of the Prague university. In 1417 the university officially adopted the [[Hussites|Hussite]] confession and henceforth, [[Utraquism|Utraquist]] scholars taught and studied here. The rising influence of this doctrine and the execution of Jan Hus in 1415 culminated in the outbreak of the [[Hussite Wars]].

{{Legality of cannabis by US state}}

In the [[United States]], the [[Recreational drug use|non-medical]] use of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] is decriminalized in 13 states (plus the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]), and legalized in another 10 states (plus the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] and [[Northern Mariana Islands]]), as of November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MARIJUANA OVERVIEW|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/marijuana-overview.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Decriminalization" refers to a policy of reduced penalties for cannabis offenses, typically involving a [[civil penalty]] for possession of small amounts (similar to how a minor traffic violation is treated), instead of criminal prosecution or the threat of arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marijuana Legalization and Decriminalization Overview|url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/marijuana-legalization-and-decriminalization-overview.html|website=FindLaw|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cannalawblog"&gt;{{cite news|title=Marijuana Decriminalization Versus Legalization: A Difference That Matters|url=https://www.cannalawblog.com/marijuana-decriminalization-versus-legalization-cause-it-matters/|accessdate=January 23, 2018|work=Canna Law Blog|date=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In jurisdictions without any penalties the policy is referred to as legalization, although the term decriminalization is sometimes broadly used for this purpose as well.&lt;ref name="cannalawblog" /&gt;

The movement to decriminalize cannabis in the U.S. emerged during the 1970s, when a total of 11 states decriminalized (beginning with [[Oregon]] in 1973).  The findings of the 1972 [[Shafer Commission]] helped provide momentum to these efforts, as did the 1976 election of [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|President Jimmy Carter]] (who spoke in favor of decriminalization and endorsed legislation to federally decriminalize).  By the end of the decade the tide had turned strongly in the other direction, however, and no state would decriminalize again until 2001.

Efforts to legalize cannabis in the U.S. included a number of ballot initiatives leading up to 2012, but none succeeded.  In 2012, success was finally achieved when [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Colorado]] became the first two states to legalize.  In 2014 and 2016 several more states followed, and in 2018 [[Vermont]] became the first to legalize through an act of state legislature.  All jurisdictions that have legalized allow for the commercial distribution of cannabis, except Vermont and the District of Columbia.  All allow for personal cultivation, except Washington state.

At the federal level, cannabis remains prohibited for any use under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] of 1970.  The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] has generally not enforced federal law in states that have legalized cannabis, under the guidance of the [[Cole Memorandum]] that was adopted in August 2013.  In January 2018, however, the Cole memo was rescinded by Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]], granting [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorneys]] greater authority to enforce federal law.

==Early use and criminalization ==
Cannabis was popularized in the U.S. around the mid-19th century, used mostly for its therapeutic benefits in the treatment of a wide range of medical conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Marijuana as Medicine - 2900 BC to Present|url=http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.timeline.php?timelineID=000026|website=ProCon.org|accessdate=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its use as medicine continued into the 20th century, but declined somewhat due to a number of different factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Grinspoon|first1=Lester|title=History of Cannabis as a Medicine|date=August 16, 2005|url=http://www.maps.org/research-archive/mmj/grinspoon_history_cannabis_medicine.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The recreational use of cannabis began to emerge in the early 20th century, introduced to the U.S. by Mexicans fleeing the dictatorship of President [[Porfirio Díaz]].&lt;ref name="Dufton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dufton|first1=Emily|title=Grass Roots: The Rise and Fall and Rise of Marijuana in America|date=December 5, 2017|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0465096169}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As its use spread north of the border, cannabis became stigmatized due to strong anti-Mexican sentiments that had taken hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=David|title=The Racist Roots of Marijuana Prohibition|url=https://fee.org/articles/the-racist-roots-of-marijuana-prohibition/|accessdate=January 31, 2018|work=Foundation for Economic Freedom|date=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1936, the non-medical use of cannabis had been banned in every state.&lt;ref name="Booth history"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Booth|first1=Martin|title=Cannabis: A History|date=June 2005|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-42494-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=O7AoY6ljSygC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cannabis was then effectively outlawed at the federal level, following the passage of the [[Marihuana Tax Act of 1937]].&lt;ref name="tax act"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glick|first1=Daniel|title=80 Years Ago This Week, Marijuana Prohibition Began With These Arrests|url=https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/drug-war-prisoners-1-2-true-story-moses-sam-two-denver-drifters-became-cannabis-pioneers|accessdate=January 31, 2018|work=Leafly|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cannabis remained mostly an underground drug until the 1960s, when it found widespread popularity among large numbers of young people and [[hippie]]s, and was used commonly at protests against the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  Cannabis was officially banned for any use (medical included) with the passage of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] of 1970, following [[Leary v. United States|a constitutional challenge]] to the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tayag|first1=Yasmin|title=Timothy Leary's Arrest For Marijuana Possession Still Matters 50 Years Later|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/12782-timothy-leary-s-arrest-for-marijuana-possession-still-matters-50-years-later|accessdate=February 27, 2018|work=Inverse|date=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of decriminalization==
===Supporters of reform begin to organize (1964)===
The movement to legalize cannabis in the U.S. was sparked by the 1964 arrest of {{vanchor|Lowell Eggemeier}}, a [[San Francisco]] man who walked into the city's Hall of Justice and lit up a joint, requesting to be arrested.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Martin A.|title=Smoke Signals: A Social History of Marijuana – Medical, Recreational, and Scientific|date=August 2012|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|isbn=978-1439102602}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As it was a felony to use cannabis in California, Eggemeier was quickly hauled off to prison, where he was held for close to a year.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  Eggemeier was defended by attorney James R. White, who had never worked on a drug case before nor was he much familiar with cannabis, but took interest in the matter as a devoted civil libertarian (describing himself as "to the right of [[Barry Goldwater]]").&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;  While researching the case, White became a strong proponent for the legalization of cannabis, and went on to found LEMAR (shortened version of LEgalize MARijuana) in December 1964.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  LEMAR was the first organization in the U.S. dedicated to ending cannabis prohibition.&lt;ref name="Heddleston"&gt;{{cite thesis|last1=Heddleston|first1=Thomas R.|title=From the Frontlines to the Bottom Line: Medical Marijuana, the War on Drugs, and the Drug Policy Reform Movement|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1t7220hj|publisher=UC Santa Cruz Electronic Theses and Dissertations|date=June 2012|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/MedicalMarijuanaTheWarOnDrugsAndTheDrugPolicyReformMovement|archive-date=February 16, 2014|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those in attendance at the first LEMAR rally was poet [[Allen Ginsberg]], who was staying in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] at the time.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;  Upon returning home to New York City he founded the first East Coast chapter of LEMAR.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  Ginsberg's activism and writings helped inspire the founding of other LEMAR chapters, including a [[Detroit]] chapter by fellow poet [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]].&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;  Similar groups advocating for legalization formed across the country in the ensuing years.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;

By 1971, two main groups supporting cannabis reform had emerged – Amorphia based in San Francisco (founded by Blair Newman) and the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] (NORML) based in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  NORML was founded by [[Keith Stroup]], an attorney who had previously worked as a researcher for [[Ralph Nader]]'s National Commission on Product Safety.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  Drawing upon his experience working with Nader (and his consumer advocate devotees "Nader's Raiders"), Stroup sought to create a consumer advocacy group dedicated to protecting cannabis consumers.&lt;ref name="Heddleston" /&gt;  He founded NORML in 1970, with the aim of adopting a more professionalized manner of advocacy than other cannabis reform groups (such as Amorphia) more closely associated with the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]].&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  Eventually Amorphia was merged into NORML as it ran into financial difficulties, becoming the California chapter of NORML in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Mission|url=http://www.canorml.org/canormlmission.html|website=California NORML|accessdate=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shafer Commission (1972)===
As part of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, a commission was formed to study the rising use of cannabis in America, and advise to the president and Congress a set of policy recommendations.  [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] appointed several members of the commission himself, including former Pennsylvania governor [[Raymond P. Shafer]] (who was a former prosecutor with a tough "law and order" reputation) to serve as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zeese|first1=Kevin|title=Once-Secret "Nixon Tapes" Show Why the U.S. Outlawed Pot|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/12666/once-secret_%22nixon_tapes%22_show_why_the_u.s._outlawed_pot|accessdate=January 13, 2018|work=AlterNet|date=March 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nixon made it known to Shafer that he strongly opposed the legalization of cannabis, and he advised Shafer to "keep your commission in line" months before the final report was issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Nixon Tapes Show Roots of Marijuana Prohibition: Misinformation, Culture Wars and Prejudice|url=http://www.csdp.org/research/shafernixon.pdf|work=Common Sense for Drug Policy|date=March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The release of the 1184-page report would not be to Nixon's liking, however, as the [[Shafer Commission]] concluded in March 1972 that cannabis was a relatively benign drug whose dangers had been exaggerated.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  The report also concluded that harsh laws against cannabis did more harm than good, and recommended that criminal penalties be removed for possession and distribution of small amounts of the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gardner|first1=Fred|title=How Nixon Destroyed the Evidence on Marijuana|url=https://www.marijuana.com/news/2014/08/richard-nixon-was-the-marijuana-antichrist/|accessdate=January 13, 2018|work=marijuana.com|date=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nixon firmly rejected the results of the commission,&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt; while proponents of reform used the findings to their advantage, frequently citing the report to build support for decriminalizing cannabis in subsequent years.&lt;ref name="Heddleston" /&gt;

===Decriminalization efforts materialize (1970s)===
During the early 1970s, legislative efforts to reform cannabis laws began to materialize.  Among these was a 1972 ballot measure seeking to legalize cannabis in California, spearheaded by the group Amorphia.&lt;ref name="sinclair"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sinclair|first1=John|title=Getting NORML -- A brief history of the movement to legalize marijuana|url=https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/getting-norml/Content?oid=2150635|accessdate=January 24, 2018|work=Detroit Metro Times|date=October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[California Proposition 19 (1972)|Proposition 19]] – the California Marijuana Initiative – ultimately failed with 33% of the vote.&lt;ref name="Heddleston" /&gt;  Although it was defeated by a wide margin, supporters of the initiative were encouraged by the results,&lt;ref name="sinclair" /&gt; which provided momentum to other reform efforts in California throughout the decade.&lt;ref name="Heddleston" /&gt;

In 1973 [[Oregon]] became the first state to decriminalize cannabis, reducing the penalty for up to one ounce to a $100 fine.&lt;ref name="Heddleston" /&gt;  Other states were reluctant to follow, however, in part due to influence from the Nixon administration which staunchly opposed such reforms.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  Decriminalization efforts were bolstered by Nixon's resignation in August 1974, however, ushering in the [[Presidency of Gerald Ford|Ford administration]] and a more tolerant view toward cannabis from the White House.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  The November 1974 election also brought a wave of new Democrats to state legislatures across the country.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Patrick|title=High In America: The True Story Behind NORML And The Politics Of Marijuana|date=February 27, 1981|publisher=The Viking Press|isbn=978-0670119905|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/special/anderson/highinamerica.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 a federal committee examined the use of cannabis and other drugs in America, building upon the findings of the Shafer Commission three years earlier.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  Although the committee – the Domestic Council Drug Abuse Task Force – did not advocate decriminalization outright, it did recommend that attention be shifted to more harmful drugs (such as [[heroin]]), and concluded that cannabis was the "least serious" drug problem facing the nation.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  Also in 1975, congressional hearings were held on decriminalizing cannabis for the first time.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  As these developments provided momentum to reform efforts, a total of five more states ([[Alaska]], [[Maine]], [[Colorado]], [[California]], and [[Ohio]]) decriminalized cannabis in 1975.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;

Shortly after Alaska decriminalized in 1975, a ruling by the Supreme Court of Alaska effectively legalized cannabis in the state, in the case ''[[Ravin v. State]]''.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;  The ruling stemmed from the 1972 arrest of Irwin Ravin, an Alaska resident who allowed himself to be caught possessing cannabis in order to challenge state law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burke|first1=Jill|title=Irwin Ravin, Alaska marijuana rights activist, dies|url=https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/article/irwin-ravin-alaska-marijuana-rights-activist-dies/2010/04/13/|accessdate=January 15, 2018|work=Anchorage Daily News|date=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At trial, Ravin's defense argued that the state constitution guaranteed a [[right to privacy]], which extended to the use of cannabis in one's home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunham|first1=Michael|title=When the Smoke Clears|url=http://reason.com/archives/1983/03/01/when-the-smoke-clears/print|accessdate=January 15, 2018|work=Reason|date=March 1, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 1975 the state Supreme Court agreed, legalizing the use, possession, and cultivation of cannabis in amounts for personal use.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;

In the following years, decriminalization laws passed in [[Minnesota]] (1976), [[Mississippi]] (1977), [[New York (state)|New York]] (1977), [[North Carolina]] (1977), and [[Nebraska]] (1978).&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  NORML was actively involved in helping to pass these laws, lobbying in support of legislation and paying for decriminalization proponents (including members of the Shafer Commission) to travel to various states to testify.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;

As decriminalization efforts continued to progress during the 1970s, many supporters of reform – including Stroup himself – believed federal decriminalization was just around the corner.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  This optimism was particularly buoyed by the 1976 election of [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Jimmy Carter]], who spoke out in favor of decriminalization during his presidential campaign (earning him the support of both Stroup and NORML).&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  Carter was urged to speak in support of decriminalization by [[Peter Bourne]], an Atlanta physician who grew close to Carter during his time as Georgia governor.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  Upon being elected president, Carter gave Bourne an office in the [[West Wing]] and the official title "Special Assistant to the President for Drug Abuse".&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  From this position, Bourne continued to advocate for cannabis decriminalization, while also developing a close relationship with Stroup and NORML.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  In August 1977, the White House issued its first official position paper on drugs, which Stroup helped draft.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  Included in the paper was a call for up to one ounce of cannabis to be decriminalized at the federal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walsh|first1=Edward|title=Carter Endorses Decriminalization Of Marijuana|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1977/08/03/carter-endorses-decriminalization-of-marijuana/7e4b0e9a-90c9-4bdb-a49b-57290236a671/|accessdate=January 24, 2018|work=The Washington Post|date=August 3, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Drug Abuse Message to the Congress|url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/drug-abuse-message-the-congress|accessdate=March 9, 2018|work=The American Presidency Project|date=August 2, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the fall of 1977, the relationship between Bourne and Stroup had begun to sour.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  The Carter administration was providing helicopters to the government of [[Mexico]], which were being used to eradicate cannabis crops by spraying the herbicide [[paraquat]].&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  Stroup argued that these crops could find their way into the U.S. and harm American consumers of the drug.  Simultaneously, Stroup was growing frustrated that the administration was not doing more to support the decriminalization policies that it had previously championed.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  By March 1978 Stroup's anger had reached a boiling point, as Bourne and the administration continued to support paraquat spraying in the face of growing public opposition to the practice (and emerging evidence that it posed a serious health risk).&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;  Stroup decided to take matters into his own hands, contacting reporter [[Gary Cohn (journalist)|Gary Cohn]] and informing him that Bourne had used [[cocaine]] at the annual Christmas party hosted by NORML a few months earlier.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;  Although this information was not immediately published, in July 1978, when Bourne was in the midst of a scandal over writing an illegal prescription, the cocaine revelation came to light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shaffer|first1=Ronald|title=Cocaine - Sniffing Incident|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1978/07/21/cocaine-sniffing-incident/9e5b6175-25a7-4169-8a8f-e12484aaa961/|accessdate=January 16, 2018|work=The Washington Post|date=July 21, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Faced with two simultaneous scandals of illegal prescription-writing and drug use, Bourne resigned from his position.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;

The resignation of Peter Bourne was considered a significant blow for decriminalization proponents in a number of ways.  First, there were no advisers pushing Carter to support decriminalization anymore, as Bourne's successor Lee Dogoloff was not particularly sympathetic to the cause.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  Also, the embarrassment of the Bourne scandal, along with allegations of drug use that had been made against other members of the administration, made decriminalization a much more politically sensitive topic that Carter thus sought to avoid.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  It was not just the Carter administration that had been damaged from the incident, however.  Stroup's role in the scandal proved to be a major embarrassment for NORML, and by December 1978 led to his resignation, due to the anger and distrust that his actions had caused.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;  The departure of Stroup also caused NORML to lose the support of some of its top donors, including its largest benefactor the [[Playboy Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Heddleston" /&gt;

===Parent revolution, Reagan years, and recriminalization (late 1970s through 80s)===
By the end of 1970s, efforts to decriminalize cannabis had stalled at both the state and federal level.  Although the fallout of the Bourne scandal played a significant role, there was another factor at play in bringing about this shift.  A movement of anti-drug parent activists was rising up nationwide, galvanized by a spike in adolescent drug use and the wide availability of [[Drug paraphernalia|paraphernalia]] products for sale (some of which resembled children's toys).&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  The movement sprang out of [[Atlanta]] in 1976, as a number of [[support group]]s were formed for parents concerned about teen drug use.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  The groups soon spread across the country, and subsequently turned attention to legislative affairs such as halting decriminalization efforts and passing anti-paraphernalia laws.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  The movement continued to grow as [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]] took office in 1981, with first lady [[Nancy Reagan]] particularly involving herself in the cause.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  Efforts to decriminalize cannabis had quickly been stamped out for the foreseeable future.

During the Reagan years, the federal war on drugs was significantly ramped up, and a number of states acted to increase penalties for drug crimes.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;  Meanwhile, NORML struggled to regain the influence that it once held, as it dealt with significant decreases in funding and membership, and underwent frequent changes to organizational leadership.&lt;ref name="Dufton" /&gt;  In 1985, part of NORML was split off to found the Drug Policy Foundation, which was then merged with the [[Lindesmith Center]] to become the [[Drug Policy Alliance]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="Heddleston" /&gt;  Members of NORML further split off in 1995 to found the [[Marijuana Policy Project]].

 As of 2018 thirteen states had decriminalization policies in effect, and an additional eight states have decriminalized that later legalized.

===State recreational legalization begins (2012)===
Prior to 2012, [[Initiatives and referendums in the United States|ballot initiatives]] seeking to legalize cannabis were attempted in a number of states, but none succeeded.  Among these attempts were California in 1972 (33% support), Oregon in 1986 (26%), Alaska in 2000 (41%), Nevada in 2002 (39%), Arizona in 2002 (43%), Alaska in 2004 (44%), Colorado in 2006 (46%), Nevada in 2006 (46%), and California in 2010 (47%).&lt;ref name="ballotpedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of marijuana on the ballot|url=https://ballotpedia.org/History_of_marijuana_on_the_ballot|website=Ballotpedia|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, success was finally achieved for legalization advocates in the states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Colorado]], when voters approved [[Initiative 502]] and [[Amendment 64]].&lt;ref name="ballotpedia" /&gt;  In subsequent years, cannabis was legalized by ballot measure in [[Oregon]] (2014), [[Alaska]] (2014), the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] (2014), [[California]] (2016), [[Nevada]] (2016), [[Maine]] (2016), [[Massachusetts]] (2016), and [[Michigan]] (2018), and by an act of legislature in [[Vermont]] (2018) and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] (2018).  In all of these jurisdictions, commercial distribution of cannabis has been legalized except for Vermont and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name="NAMSDL"&gt;{{citation|title=Marijuana: Comparison of State Laws Legalizing Personal, Non-Medical Use|url=http://www.namsdl.org/library/33FD7B09-D862-91A9-48FFEFD87F5D4611/|work=National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws|date=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Personal cultivation of cannabis is allowed in all jurisdictions, except for Washington state.  Public consumption and use by individuals under 21 are prohibited in all.&lt;ref name="NAMSDL" /&gt;

====Federal response====
After the first states legalized in 2012, uncertainty remained over how the federal government would respond.  Seeking to clarify, the Justice Department issued the [[Cole Memorandum]] in August 2013, which specified eight conditions under which enforcement of federal law would be prioritized (such as distribution of cannabis to minors or diversion of cannabis across state borders).&lt;ref name="cole memo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rough|first1=Lisa|title=The Cole Memo: What Is It and What Does It Mean?|url=https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/what-is-the-cole-memo|accessdate=January 21, 2018|work=Leafly|date=September 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from these situations, the memo generally allowed for the commercial distribution of cannabis in states where such activity has been legalized.  The Cole memo was only a non-binding set of guidelines for [[United States Attorney|federal prosecutors]], however, and therefore did not carry the force of law.

Although the Cole memo was largely adhered to by federal prosecutors, members of Congress sought the assurances that a legally binding act of legislation could provide.  The McClintock–Polis amendment was hence introduced in the U.S. House (as an attachment to the [[Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016|CJS Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2016]]) to prohibit the Justice Department from spending funds to interfere with the implementation of state cannabis laws (regarding both recreational and medical use).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Baca |first1=Ricardo |title=House passes bill to prevent DOJ from interfering in states’ medical pot laws |url=https://www.thecannabist.co/2015/06/03/house-medical-pot-marijuana/35704/ |accessdate=October 27, 2018 |work=The Cannabist |date=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=House Members Reauthorize Measure Protecting State Sanctioned Medical Marijuana Programs |url=http://norml.org/news/2015/06/04/house-members-reauthorize-measure-protecting-state-sanctioned-medical-marijuana-programs |accessdate=October 27, 2018 |work=NORML |date=June 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The McClintock–Polis amendment was narrowly defeated on June 3, 2015, by a vote of 206 to 222.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 285 |url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll285.xml |website=house.gov |accessdate=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cole memo remained in effect until January 2018, when it was rescinded by Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]].&lt;ref name="rescission"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gerstein|last2=Lima|first2=Cristiano|first1=Josh|title=Sessions announces end to policy that allowed legal pot to flourish|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/04/jeff-sessions-marijuana-policy-us-attorney-enforcement-324020|accessdate=January 21, 2018|work=Politico|date=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The intended impact of the rescission was not immediately made clear, however, in regards to what kind of crackdown (if any) on the states would be forthcoming.&lt;ref name="rescission" /&gt;  In response to the memo's rescission, the [[STATES Act]] was introduced in Congress (upon consultation with [[Presidency of Donald Trump|President Trump]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Angell |first1=Tom |title=Trump To Support Major Marijuana Legislation |url=https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-to-support-major-marijuana-legislation/ |accessdate=October 27, 2018 |work=Marijuana Moment |date=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to enshrine into law protections that the Cole memo previously provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Angell |first1=Tom |title=Senators File Marijuana Bill Following Trump Pledge To Respect State Legalization |url=https://www.marijuanamoment.net/watch-bipartisan-senators-discuss-marijuana-legislation/ |accessdate=October 27, 2018 |work=Marijuana Moment |date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  President Trump confirmed to reporters his intent to sign the STATES Act should it be approved by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ferner |first1=Matt |title=Trump Supports Relaxing Federal Pot Laws, In Blow To Jeff Sessions |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-marijuana-legalization_us_5b1abffbe4b0bbb7a0dc7d8a |accessdate=October 27, 2018 |work=HuffPost |date=June 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marijuana (cannabis) is an herb drug, which contains a very active component delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/921580861/|title = Blurred Boundaries: The Therapeutics and Politics of Medical Marijuana|last = Bostwick|first = J. Michael|date = Feb 2012|journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings|doi = 10.1016/j.mayocp.2011.10.003|pmid = 22305029|access-date= 2015-11-06 |volume=87 |issue = 2|pages=172–186|pmc=3538401}}&lt;/ref&gt; For thousands of years, it was used for medical purposes in many different parts of the world. Recent studies also agreed that THC had great potential benefits for medical purposes. A number of patients who have HIV, multiple sclerosis (MS), neuropathic chronic pain, and cancer were under medical marijuana treatment. The treatments could either be smoke on cannabis or oral preparations, which were synthetic THC and synthetic equivalent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/1691424098/|title = Medical Uses of Marijuana (Cannabis Sativa): Fact or Fallacy?|last = Maule|first = W.J.|date = 4 March 2015|journal = British Journal of Biomedical Science|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Medical Uses of Marijuana (Cannabis sativa), patients with HIV reported that the drug reduced mixed neuropathic pain more significantly in comparison to other placebo drugs. They addressed that there was a minimum of 30% pain reduction when they were under smoked medical marijuana treatment. Furthermore, under the same type of treatment, most of the patients with multiple sclerosis showed dramatic improvements on their symptoms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  After the treatment, their handwriting was much clearer and head tremor pain was less than the samples taken before the treatment. In addition, many patients that associated with chronic pain, multiple sclerosis were also under marijuana oral preparation treatment. Patients treated with dronabinol, a synthetic THC, reported that there was a 50% pain reduction compared to 30% that was experienced when given the placebo. Furthermore, cancer treatment involving chemotherapy also agreed that dronabinol had significant benefits on delaying nausea and vomiting for patients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  However, medical marijuana treatments are not for everyone and it may cause adverse side effects for others. Overall, the potential long-term side effects of medical marijuana are not yet fully classified. As a result, further studies must carry out to fully understand the benefits as well as adverse psychiatric and medical side effects of the drug.

=== Economic arguments ===
Many proponents of cannabis decriminalization have argued that decriminalizing cannabis would largely reduce costs of maintaining the criminal justice and law enforcement systems, while legalizing cannabis to allow the cultivation and sale would generate a substantial amount of income from taxing cannabis sales.

In 2005, more than 530 distinguished economists called for the legalization of cannabis in an open letter to [[George W. Bush|President Bush]], [[United States Congress|Congress]], [[Governors of the United States|Governors]], and state legislatures.&lt;ref name=letter&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/endorsers.html |title=Budgetary Implications of Marijuana Prohibition in the United States |accessdate=2008-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017021537/http://prohibitioncosts.org/endorsers.html |archivedate=2007-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The endorsers included conservative economist [[Milton Friedman]] and two other [[Nobel Prize]]-winners.&lt;ref name=letter/&gt;

The letter stated, among other things, "We, the undersigned, call your attention to the attached report [which]... shows that marijuana legalization — replacing prohibition with a system of taxation and regulation — would save $7.7 billion per year in state and federal expenditures on prohibition enforcement and produce tax revenues of at least $2.4 billion annually if marijuana were taxed like most consumer goods. If, however, marijuana were taxed similarly to alcohol or tobacco, it might generate as much as $6.2 billion annually...."

We therefore urge the country to commence an open and honest debate about marijuana prohibition. We believe such a debate will favor a regime in which marijuana is legal but taxed and regulated like other goods. At a minimum, this debate will force advocates of current policy to show that prohibition has benefits sufficient to justify the cost to taxpayers, foregone tax revenues, and numerous ancillary consequences that result from marijuana prohibition."

The report also projected the tax revenues from decriminalization, by state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/pf/features/lists/taxes_marijuana/table.html|title=CNN Money: State Marijuana Tax Revenues|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other arguments point out that the funds saved from cannabis decriminalization could be used to enforce laws for other, more serious and violent crimes.&lt;ref name=msnbc1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15305579/from/RS.5/|date=2006-10-17|title=Nevadans to vote on legalizing marijuana|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=2007-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/library/gov_johnson2.cfm|title=Report and Recommendations: Governor's Drug Policy Advisory Group|publisher=[[Drug Policy Alliance]]|date=January 2001|accessdate=2007-03-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606042550/http://www.drugpolicy.org/library/gov_johnson2.cfm|archivedate=2007-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Michael Aldrich and Tod Mikuriya published "Savings in California Marijuana Law Enforcement Costs Attributable to the Moscone Act of 1976" in the ''[[Journal of Psychoactive Drugs]]''. The study estimated [[California]] saved almost one billion dollars in a twelve-year period between 1976 and 1988, as a result of the Moscone Act of 1976 that decriminalized cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marijuanalibrary.org/JPD_Savings_1988.txt|title=Savings in California Marijuana Law Enforcement Costs Attributable to the Moscone Act of 1976 - A Summary |publisher= marijuanalibrary.org |accessdate= 2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] (ONDCP) published "Economic Costs of Drug Abuse", which stated without separately analyzing cannabis related costs, the United States was spending $12.1&amp;nbsp;billion on law enforcement and court costs, and $16.9&amp;nbsp;billion in corrections costs, totaling $29&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="norml"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.norml.org/pdf_files/NORML_Rethinking_Decriminalizing_Marijuana.pdf|author=James Austin|publisher= The JFA Institute (published on [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (United States)|NORML]])|title=Rethinking the Consequences of Decriminalizing Marijuana|date=2005-11-02|accessdate=2006-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Scott Bates of the Boreal Economic Analysis &amp; Research center prepared a study for Alaskans for Rights &amp; Revenues entitled "The Economic Implications of Marijuana Legalization in Alaska." The study estimated the [[Alaska]]n government was spending $25–30&amp;nbsp;million per year enforcing cannabis prohibition laws. The study found if the purchase of cannabis were to be taxed as a legal commodity, tax revenues would increase by about $10–20&amp;nbsp;million per year, making $35–50&amp;nbsp;million per year in funds available.&lt;ref name=norml/&gt;&lt;ref name="prohibcosts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/FinalBatesreport.pdf|title=The Economic Implications of Marijuana Legalization in Alaska|publisher=prohibitioncosts.org|accessdate=2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a study by [[Jon Gettman]] entitled "Marijuana Production in the United States" was published in the ''Bulletin of Cannabis Reform''. The report states cannabis is the top cash crop in 12 states, is one of the top three cash crops in 30 states, and is one of the top five cash crops in 39 states. Gettman estimated the value of U.S. cannabis production at $35.8&amp;nbsp;billion, which is more than the combined value of corn and wheat. Furthermore, the report states according to federal estimates, eradication efforts have failed to prevent the spread of cannabis production, as cannabis production has increased tenfold in the past 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugscience.org/Archive/bcr2/MJCropReport_2006.pdf|title=Marijuana Production in the United States|website=drugscience.org|year=2006|accessdate=2007-03-20|author=Jon Gettman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] released the 2006 World Drug Report, which stated the North American cannabis market is estimated to be worth anywhere from $10&amp;nbsp;billion to $60&amp;nbsp;billion annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://baltimorechronicle.com/2006/091506HICKMAN.shtml|title=UNODC Makes the Case for Ending Cannabis Prohibition—Inadvertently|first=John|last=Hickman|publisher=[[Baltimore Chronicle]]|accessdate=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That same study also indicated that the mountainous regions in Appalachia, and the rural areas of the West Coast are ideal for growing cannabis. Allowing farmers there to grow cannabis openly would both provide jobs and reduce the need for expensive federal welfare payments to those areas, which are disproportionately dependent on welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statemaster.com/graph/eco_wel_cas_tot_rec_percap-caseloads-total-recipients-per-capita|title=Welfare Caseloads Total recipients (per capita) (most recent) by state}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a study by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] found [[California]] has saved $2.50 for every dollar invested into [[California Proposition 36 (2000)|Proposition 36]], which decriminalized cannabis and other drug possession charges by allowing out patient treatment programs instead of incarceration. In the first year the proposition was enacted (2001), California reportedly saved $173&amp;nbsp;million, which is likely a result of fewer drug offenders in prison. In the five years after the program was enacted, 8,700 fewer people are in prison for drug offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authors=Jason Ziedenberg and Rose Braz |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060417/news_mz1e17zieden.html |title=Saving money and aiding drug users |work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date=2006-04-17 |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506150333/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060417/news_mz1e17zieden.html |archivedate=2007-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since cannabis is illegal in the United States, this policy has led to penalties for simple use and possession. Despite these penalties, users continue to find themselves in trouble with the law. The Connecticut Law Revision Commission made the following evaluation:
"(1) the costs of arresting and prosecuting marijuana offenders were significantly lower in states that had done away with criminal penalties for possessing small amounts; (2) there was a greater increase in marijuana use in states that continue to treat possession as crime than in states that treated it as a civil offense; (3) easing the penalties for marijuana did not lead to a substantial increase in the use of either alcohol or hard drugs."&lt;ref&gt;Ruschmann, J.D. (2004). ''Legalizing Marijuana'', Paul Chelsea House Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reduction of income earned by organized crime ===
The [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] has reported that cannabis sales and trafficking support violent criminal gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.usdoj.gov/ndic/pubs11/12620/marijuana.htm |title=National Drug Threat Assessment 2006|publisher=[[National Drug Intelligence Center]]|date=February 2005|accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/ndic/pubs8/8731/marijuana.htm|title=National Drug Threat Assessment 2004|publisher=[[National Drug Intelligence Center]]|date=April 2004|accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/ndic/pubs/653/marijuan.htm|title=California Northern and Eastern Districts Drug Threat Assessment|publisher=[[National Drug Intelligence Center]]|date=January 2001|accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of fully decriminalizing cannabis to allow the regulated cultivation and sale of cannabis, including [[Law Enforcement Against Prohibition]], argue that fully decriminalizing cannabis would largely decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black market cannabis sales and trafficking.&lt;ref name=msnbc1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leap.cc/Speakers/speakerbio.php?spkr=./Bios/becker.inc&amp;name=Dean%20Becker|title=Dean Becker|publisher=[[Law Enforcement Against Prohibition]]|accessdate=2007-04-03}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2002/Nov-06-Wed-2002/news/20007394.html|author=Ed Vogel|title=Legalization Initiative: Marijuana measure opposed|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|date=2006-04-11|accessdate=2007-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Displacement of alcohol consumption===
A study in the ''[[Journal of Policy Analysis and Management]]'' by Mark Anderson and Daniel Reese indicated that increased marijuana use in California is a substitute for alcohol. This research showed that participants frequently choose marijuana over other substances. They reported that over 41 percent of the people said that they prefer to use marijuana instead of alcohol. Some of the main reasons for this substitute were 'less withdrawal', 'fewer side-effects' and 'better symptom management'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Paul Armentano |url=http://www.alternet.org/drugs/marijuana-exit-drug-study-suggests-some-are-taking-it-substitute-prescription-drugs-and |title=Is Marijuana an 'Exit Drug'?

[[Secretary of State of California|California Secretary of State's office]] said that on September 7, 2010 the beer lobby donated $10,000 to Public Safety First, a group which opposed the passage of Proposition 19 to legalize cannabis.&lt;ref name=laweekly&gt;{{cite web |author=J.

=== Reduction of subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs ===
The Marijuana Policy Project argues that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpp.org/assets/pdfs/download-materials/TandRARGUMENTS092008.pdf |title=Effective Arguments for Advocates of Taxing and Regulating Marijuana |accessdate=2008-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918173659/http://www.mpp.org/assets/pdfs/download-materials/TandRARGUMENTS092008.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Research shows that the actual "gateway" is the illegal drug market. The World Health Organization noted that any gateway effect associated with marijuana use may actually be due to marijuana prohibition because "exposure to other drugs when purchasing cannabis on the black-market increases the opportunity to use other illicit drugs." A study comparing experienced cannabis users in Amsterdam, where adults can purchase small amounts of cannabis from regulated businesses, with similarly experienced cannabis users in San Francisco, where non-medical possession and sale of cannabis remains completely illegal, bolstered this hypothesis: The San Francisco cannabis users were twice as likely to use crack cocaine as their Dutch counterparts, more than twice as likely to use amphetamines, and five times as likely to be current users of opiates.}}

Cannabis has been subject to many studies over the past century.

=== Reduction in prison overcrowding and strain on the criminal justice system ===
Supporters of decriminalization argue that if cannabis were to be legalized it would reduce the amount of non violent offenders in prison making room for the incarceration of more violent offenders as well as easing the current strain that the large amount of cannabis possession cases have on the criminal justice system. They also propose that it would also save taxpayers the cost of incarceration for these non violent offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/~keelr/180/2003_pot_arrests.htm |title=Marijuana Arrests at All-Time High, Far Exceed Violent Crime Arrests |publisher=Umsl.edu |date=2004-10-29 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, there were just under 200,000 criminals serving time in state and federal prisons and an upwards of 750,000 in local jails for marijuana related crimes. Today there are over 1.5&amp;nbsp;million Americans serving time in an institution. If marijuana was decriminalized, these numbers were further be reduced again to below 700,000 inmates and save the taxpayers billions of dollars per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://norml.org/news/2007/11/21/decriminalizing-pot-will-reduce-prison-population-have-no-adverse-impact-on-public-safety-study-says|title = Unlocking America: Why and How to Reduce America's Prison Population|date = 21 November 2007|accessdate = 2014-10-24|website = Decriminalizing Pot Will Reduce Prison Population, Have No Adverse Impact On Public Safety, Study Says|publisher = NORML}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States spends an estimated $68&amp;nbsp;billion per year on prisoners with a third of that number have been incarcerated for non-violent drug crimes including a sixth of those numbers as marijuana drug related offenses.

=== Individual freedom ===
Some people are in favor of decriminalization and legalization of marijuana simply for the moral stance that individuals' freedom for [[property rights]] should be respected.

Many people who support drug freedom policies may personally be strongly against drug use personally but still wants to protect the freedom of others to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/171252/congressmen-pressure-obama-new-marijuana-laws|title=Barney Frank, Ron Paul Pressure Obama on New Marijuana Laws|journal=The Nation|date=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investors===

In order to effectively campaign to legalize recreational cannabis use millions of dollars have been spent to lobby for this reform. [[George Soros]] is a billionaire hedge fund manager that has spent over $25&amp;nbsp;million on marijuana reform efforts.&lt;ref name=ForbesSoros&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2014/10/02/an-inside-look-at-the-biggest-drug-reformer-in-the-country-george-soros/|title=An Inside Look At The Biggest Drug Reformer In The Country: George Soros|publisher=Forbes|date=2014-10-02|author=Chloe Sorvino|accessdate=2015-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Soros wrote an op-ed in the ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' citing the fact that African Americans are no more likely than other Americans to use marijuana but are far more likely to be arrested for possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/26/soros-marijuana-donation |title=George Soros gives $1m to California's pro-cannabis campaign |newspaper=The Guardian |author=Suzanne Goldenberg |date=2010-10-26 |accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soros efforts to reform marijuana laws were predated by fellow billionaire, the late Peter Lewis. Lewis was the former chairman of Progressive Insurance and died November 23, 2013.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/luisakroll/2013/11/24/billionaire-peter-lewis-who-fought-to-legalize-marjuana-has-died/ |title=Billionaire Peter Lewis, Advocate Of Marijuana Legalization, Dies At 80 |publisher=Forbes |author=Luisa Kroll |date=2013-11-24 |accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis is considered to be the most high-profile billionaire backer of drug reform and the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] (NORML) estimated that Lewis had spent well over $40&amp;nbsp;million funding the cause since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; During the November 2012 election, he spent almost $3&amp;nbsp;million helping secure the passage of marijuana legalization bills in both Washington state and Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;
The list of capitalists who have joined Soros and Lewis in the cause of Marijuana reform include John Sperling, who is the founder of the University of Phoenix and George Zimmer who is the founder and former CEO of Men's Wearhouse. Sperling donated $70,000 to support marijuana law reform in Oregon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://truth-out.org/news/item/9260-marijuana-advocates-spend-big-and-defeat-drug-war-proponent-in-oregon |title=Marijuana Advocates Spend Big and Defeat Drug War Proponent in Oregon |publisher=Truthout |date=2012-05-20 |accessdate=2014-05-04 |author=Zaid Jilani}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Zimmer contributed $20,000 to advocate for marijuana decriminalization in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/36179727 |title=The Marijuana Lobby: All Grown Up |author=Rob Reuteman |publisher=CNBC |date=2010-04-20 |accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These capitalists have helped pave the way for a new type of business with special interests in the cannabis industry. The ArcView Group was founded in 2010 by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and marijuana advocates Troy Dayton and Steve DeAngelo.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20130502-904140.html |title=ArcView Angel Investors Commit Over $1 Million to Marijuana Industry Start-ups at Seattle Event |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2013-05-02 |accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their company teams up angel investors with companies that produce cannabis products and it's been one of the major sources of startup revenue for cannabis-related companies.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; This company has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to educational reform groups like the Students for [[Students for Sensible Drug Policy|Sensible Drug Policy]] and a pro-legalization PAC run by the Marijuana Policy Project.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

===The ACLU and NAACP===
The ACLU takes a firm position that decriminalizing cannabis will keep tens of thousands of people from entering into the criminal justice system&lt;ref name="marijuana-law-reform"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/criminal-law-reform/marijuana-law-reform |title=Marijuana Law Reform |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |date= |accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; as police efforts result in both unnecessary arrests and the enforcement of marijuana laws wastes billions of tax payers' dollars.&lt;ref name=billions&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/billions-dollars-wasted-racially-biased-arrests |title=Billions of Dollars Wasted on Racially Biased Arrests |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |date= |accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; They affirm that removing criminal penalties for marijuana offenses will therefore reduce the U.S. prison population and more effectively protect the public and promote public health.&lt;ref name="marijuana-law-reform"/&gt; One of the reasons that the ACLU has been such a strong supporter of drug decriminalization is that according to their research drug related arrests have largely driven America's incarceration rate to unacceptable levels. Drug offenders comprise over 500,000 of the more than 2&amp;nbsp;million people in America's prisons and jails, and drug offenses combined with failed drug tests account for a significant number of those returning to prison for parole and probation violations.&lt;ref name="marijuana-law-reform"/&gt; Between 2001 and 2010, there were over 7&amp;nbsp;million pot arrests in the U.S. and of these arrests 88% were for simply having marijuana.&lt;ref name="aclu-marijuana-arrests-numbers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marijuana Arrests By The Numbers|url=https://www.aclu.org/gallery/marijuana-arrests-numbers|website=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; These marijuana related arrests now account for over half of all drug related arrests in the United States.&lt;ref name="marijuana-law-reform"/&gt; These arrests tend to be racially imbalanced as a black person is 3.73 times more likely to be arrested than a white person for marijuana related charges,&lt;ref name="marijuana-law-reform"/&gt; despite research that suggests fairly equal usage rates between the two races.&lt;ref name="aclu-marijuana-arrests-numbers"/&gt; The ACLU is further troubled by the amount of money that is spent annually to enforce marijuana laws as they claim that over 3&amp;nbsp;billion dollars are spent every year by states to enforce marijuana regulation,&lt;ref name="aclu-marijuana-arrests-numbers"/&gt; while the drug's availability has not declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/criminal-law-reform/war-marijuana-black-and-white-report |title=The War on Marijuana in Black and White: Report |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |date=2013-06-03 |accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU claims that over 50% of Americans support marijuana legalization&lt;ref name="aclu-marijuana-arrests-numbers"/&gt; and they are advocating for the legalization of Cannabis through the Criminal Law Reform Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform |title=Criminal Law Reform |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |date= |accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that the resources that are spent on enforcing marijuana law could be better invested in our communities through education and job training.&lt;ref name=billions/&gt;

The NAACP has taken a similar stance and has cited the same data used by the ACLU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2014/mar/16/naacp/new-england-naacp-says-african-americans-us-are-ar/ |title=New England NAACP says African-Americans in U.S. are arrested on marijuana charges at more than three times the rate of whites |publisher=Politifact |date= |accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NAACP has been strong supporters of the [[Legal history of cannabis in the United States|Respect State Marijuana Laws Act]] – H.R. 1523 and has reached out to members of congress to get this act passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/09/marijuana-naacp_n_4246693.html |title=Bipartisan Marijuana Bill Appears To Have One More Big Supporter In Its Corner: The NAACP |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=2013-11-09 |accessdate=2014-05-04 |author=Chris Gentilviso}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act is designed to decrease penalties for low-level marijuana possession and supports prohibiting federal enforcement of marijuana laws in states which have lesser penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naacp.org/press/entry/naacp-passes-resolution-on-hr.-1523 |title=NAACP Passes Resolution on HR. 1523 |publisher=NAACP |date=2013-11-13 |accessdate=2014-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20140206014250/http%3A//www.naacp.org/press/entry/naacp%2Dpasses%2Dresolution%2Don%2Dhr.%2D1523 |archivedate=2014-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Racial bias ===
There are claims of historical evidence showing that a significant reason for marijuana ban by US government was political and racist in nature, aimed to suppress Black and Mexican minorities. A quote from 1934 newspaper

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marihuana influences Negroes to look at white people in the eye, step on white men's shadows and look at a white woman twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guither|first1=Pete|title=Why is Marijuana Illegal|url=http://www.drugwarrant.com/articles/why-is-marijuana-illegal/|website=drugwarrant.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Loo, Hoorens, Hof and Kahan also talked about this issue in their book 'Cannabis policy, implementation and outcomes'. According to them, statistics show that controlling cannabis use leads in many cases to selective law enforcement, which increases the chances of arresting people from certain ethnicities. For example, while Blacks and Hispanics constitute about 20% of cannabis users in the US, they accounted for 58% of cannabis offenders sentenced under federal law in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Loo, M. v., Hoorens, S., Hof, C. v., &amp; Kahan, J. P. (2003). Cannabis policy and social consequences. Cannabis policy, implementation and outcomes (50-63). Santa Monica, CA: Rand.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Occupational Health and Safety ===
Since cannabis is still recognized as an illegal substance under federal law, each state has their own rules and regulations with regards to cannabis cultivation. As this is still a relatively new industry, there are challenges in formulating safety regulations; much discrepancy exists between state regulations and federal regulations with respect to legal agricultural practices.&lt;ref name="dilemma"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-08-01|title=Cannabis, pesticides and conflicting laws: The dilemma for legalized States and implications for public health|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027323001400097X|journal=Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology|language=en|volume=69|issue=3|pages=284–288|doi=10.1016/j.yrtph.2014.05.015|pmid=24859075|issn=0273-2300|last1=Stone|first1=Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since there are no federal regulations on pesticide use in cannabis cultivation, none are registered for use in the United States, and illegal pesticide use is common. Samples purchased by law enforcement in California, have for example detected pesticide residues present on cannabis product for sale to the public.&lt;ref name="dilemma" /&gt;  Workers risk exposure to THC, pesticides, and fertilizers through respiratory, dermal, and ocular pathways. One grower was reported to have developed [[pruritus]] and contact [[Hives|uticaria]] from simply handling the plants, after being tolerant to moderate use before. Other allergic reactions, such as asthma, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and cutaneous symptoms have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ehstoday.com/safety/study-cannabis-workers-value-safety-lack-formal-training|title=Study: Cannabis Workers Value Safety but Lack Formal Training|date=2018-03-27|work=EHS Today|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers are also at risk of overexposure to UV rays from lamps used, and overexposure to carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides from devices used to promote cannabis growth. Cuts, nicks, and scrapes are also a risk during the harvest of cannabis buds. A survey completed by the CDPHE has found that while workers valued safety, 46%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://workersafety.3m.com/growing-worker-safety-concerns-medical-marijuana-industry/|title=Growing Worker Safety Concerns in the Medical Marijuana Industry|date=April 17, 2018|website=3M|access-date=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of them never received any training in safety procedures and protocols. Washington and [https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/marijuana-occupational-safety-and-health Colorado] have published valuable state guides with state regulations and best practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/marijuana-occupational-safety-and-health|title=Marijuana occupational safety and health {{!}} Department of Public Health and Environment|website=www.colorado.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental Safety ===
'''Pesticide Use''': "The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]] regulates pesticide use on agricultural crops, but has not tested any pesticides for use on marijuana because it is still illegal at the federal level. Given what is known about the chemicals commonly used on marijuana plants, that means a potential public health hazard for the millions of people who smoke or consume marijuana, as well as those who work at the grow operations."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/06/17/413429435/growing-concern-over-unregulated-pesticide-use-among-marijuana-growers|title=Concern Grows Over Unregulated Pesticide Use Among Marijuana Growers|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2013 study published in the ''Journal of Toxicology'' that assessed quantities of pesticides marijuana smokers were exposed to, it was found that "recoveries of residues were as high as 69.5% depending on the device used and the component investigated, suggesting that the potential of pesticide and chemical residue exposures to cannabis users is substantial and may pose a significant toxicological threat in the absence of adequate regulatory frameworks".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Nicholas|last2=Elzinga|first2=Sytze|last3=Raber|first3=Jeffrey C.|date=2013|title=Determination of Pesticide Residues in Cannabis Smoke|journal=Journal of Toxicology|language=en|volume=2013|pages=1–6|doi=10.1155/2013/378168|issn=1687-8191|pmc=3666265|pmid=23737769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marijuana also differs from other agricultural products in that it can not be rinsed with water as the product is traditionally dried or cured. 

The following six pesticides are considered highly toxic but commonly used on marijuana crops:

# [[Myclobutanil]] (fungicide): Developmental and reproductive toxin; Not allowed in WA or CO, found on tested samples in CO and OR
# [[Pyrethrin]] (insecticide): Carcinogen; Approved in CO and WA
# [[Fenoxycarb]] (insecticide): Carciniogen, cholinesterase inhibitor; not allowed in WA
# [[Thiophanate-methyl]] (fungicide): Carcinogen; Not allowed in WA or CO, found on tested samples in CO. 
# [[Avermectin|Avermectin-]] (insectide): Developmental and reproductive toxin: not allowed in CO or WA, but found on tested samples in CO
# [[Bifenthrin]] (insectide): Developmental and reproductive toxin, possible carcinogen; Not allowed in CO or WA, but found on tested samples in CO and OR&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Myclobutanil is the active chemical compound in the pesticide Eagle 20EW, the use of which is prohibited in Colorado. However, Eagle 20EW is still a commonly used pesticide. The federal limit, set by the EPA, for the amount in myclobutanil residue on lettuce is 0.3 parts per million – yet the amount tested on marijuana in Denver has at times reached 23.83 parts per million.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A complete list of pesticides allowed for use on cannabis in Colorado approved by the Colorado Department of Agriculture is available [https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/agplants/pesticide-use-cannabis-production-information here], and for Washington state as approved by the Washington State Department of Agriculture is available [https://agr.wa.gov/pestfert/pesticides/pesticideuseonmarijuana.aspx here]. 

'''Energy Use''': Indoor marijuana cultivation is highly energy intensive. It is estimated that the industry accounts for 1% of all the nation's electricity use, which is six times the amount the pharmaceutical industry consumes. In terms of emissions, it is estimated that fifteen million metric tons of carbon are produced by the industry annually. Legalization would require those in the industry to meet long standing statutes such as the Clean Air Act, as well as give the opportunity to states to enforce provisions on energy use through conditions of licensure. For example in the city of Boulder, Colorado, marijuana businesses are required to utilize renewable energy to offset 100% of their electricity consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gina|first=Warren,|date=2014-09-24|title=Regulating Pot to Save the Polar Bear: Energy and Climate Impacts of the Marijuana Industry|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2501126|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecosystem:''' A single mature marijuana plant can consume 23 liters of water a day, compared to 13 liters for a grape plant. Historically, many outdoor cultivators have used illegal river and lake diversions to irrigate crops. These diversions have led to dewatering of streams and rivers which is well documented in areas of Northern California. As with any other agricultural crop, increase in demand leads to increased clear cutting of forests which can increase erosion, habitat destruction, and river diversion. Legalization and subsequent regulation could mitigate such issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carah|first=Jennifer K.|last2=Howard|first2=Jeanette K.|last3=Thompson|first3=Sally E.|last4=Short Gianotti|first4=Anne G.|last5=Bauer|first5=Scott D.|last6=Carlson|first6=Stephanie M.|last7=Dralle|first7=David N.|last8=Gabriel|first8=Mourad W.|last9=Hulette|first9=Lisa L.|date=2015-06-19|title=High Time for Conservation: Adding the Environment to the Debate on Marijuana Liberalization|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=65|issue=8|pages=822–829|doi=10.1093/biosci/biv083|issn=1525-3244|pmc=4776720|pmid=26955083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs ===
In 1985, [[Gabriel G. Nahas]] published ''Keep Off the Grass'', which stated that "[the] biochemical changes induced by marijuana in the brain result in drug-seeking, drug taking behavior, which in many instances will lead the user to experiment with other pleasurable substances. The risk of progression from marijuana to cocaine to heroin is now well documented."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nahas|first=Gabriel|authorlink=Gabriel G. Nahas|title=Keep off the Grass|publisher=P.S. Eriksson|year=1985|isbn=978-0-8397-4384-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, [[The Partnership for a Drug-Free America|Partnership for a Drug-Free America]] with support from the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] (NIDA) and the White House Office of Drug Control Policy launched a campaign against cannabis use citing a [[Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse]] (CASA) report, which claimed that cannabis users are 85 times more likely than non-cannabis users to try cocaine.&lt;ref name=ag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drcnet.org/pubs/guide/06-95/gateway.html|title=Marijuana's Gateway Myth|website=drcnet.org|publisher=The Activist Guide|accessdate=2006-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an article published in ''The Activist Guide'' by John Morgan and Lynn Zimmer entitled "Marijuana's Gateway Myth", claims CASA's statistic is false. The article states:&lt;ref name="ag" /&gt;&lt;!---none of these people NOR the book have articles and are therefore not notable. There must be a better reference someplace. [[WP:NN]] people should NOT be in the article by name since they don't have notability---&gt;

{{quote|The high risk-factor obtained is a product not of the fact that so many marijuana users use cocaine but that so many cocaine users used marijuana previously. It is hardly a revelation that people who use one of the least popular drugs are likely to use the more popular ones — not only marijuana, but also alcohol and tobacco cigarettes. The obvious statistic not publicized by CASA is that most marijuana users — 83 percent — never use cocaine.}}

Multiple opponents of cannabis decriminalization have claimed increased cannabis use results in increased abuse of other illicit drugs.&lt;ref name="msnbc1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theindiancatholic.com/newsread.asp?nid=7768 |publisher= [[Zenit News Agency]] |website= theindiancatholic.com |date=2007-06-03 |accessdate= 2007-06-10|title=Light Drugs, Heavy Consequences}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, multiple studies have found no evidence of a correlation between cannabis use and the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs.

In 1997, the Connecticut Law Revision Commission examined states that had decriminalized cannabis and found decriminalizing small amounts of cannabis has no effect on subsequent use of alcohol or "harder" illicit drugs. The study recommended [[Connecticut]] reduce cannabis possession of one ounce or less for adults age 21 and over to a civil fine.&lt;ref name="clr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/lrc/drugpolicy/drugpolicyrpt2.htm#SecD7|title=Connecticut Law Revision Commission Drug Policy Report - Part 1|publisher=Connecticut Law Revision Commission|accessdate=2007-03-26|date=1997-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, a study by the Division of Neuroscience and Behavioral Health at the [[Institute of Medicine]] entitled "Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base", found no evidence of a link between cannabis use and the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs on the basis of its particular physiological effect.&lt;ref name=IOM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.nap.edu/readingroom/books/marimed/notice.html|title=Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base|publisher=[[National Academies Press]]|year=1999|accessdate=2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2002, a study by [[RAND]] investigating whether cannabis use results in the subsequent use of [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]] was published in the British Journal of Addiction. The researchers created a mathematical model simulating adolescent drug use. National rates of cannabis and hard drug use in the model matched survey data collected from representative samples of youths from across the United States; the model produced patterns of drug use and abuse. The study stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/news/press.02/gateway.html |publisher=[[RAND]] |date=2002-12-02 |accessdate=2007-06-10 |title=RAND Study Casts Doubt on Claims that Marijuana Acts as "Gateway" to the Use of Cocaine and Heroin. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104124529/https://www.rand.org/news/press.02/gateway.html |archivedate=2006-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The people who are predisposed to use drugs and have the opportunity to use drugs are more likely than others to use both marijuana and harder drugs ... Marijuana typically comes first because it is more available.

We've shown that the marijuana gateway effect is not the best explanation for the link between marijuana use and the use of harder drugs.}}

In 2004, a study by Craig Reinarman, Peter D. A. Cohen, and Hendrien L. Kaal entitled "The Limited Relevance of Drug Policy: Cannabis in Amsterdam and in San Francisco", was published in the [[American Journal of Public Health]]. The study found no evidence that the decriminalization of cannabis leads to subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs.

In 2006, the [[Karolinska Institute]] in Sweden used twelve rats to examine how adolescent use of cannabis affects subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs. The study gave six of the twelve "teenage" rats a small dose of [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]], reportedly equivalent to one joint smoked by a human, every three days. The rats were allowed to administer [[heroin]] by pushing a lever and the study found the rats given THC took larger doses of heroin. The institute examined the brain cells in the rats and found THC alters the opioid system that is associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of [[opiate]]s on rat's brain and thus causes them to use more heroin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why teenagers should steer clear of cannabis|date=2006-07-05|accessdate=2007-05-12|last=Vince|first=Gaia|publisher=New Scientist|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn9488}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Armentano, policy analyst for [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (United States)|NORML]], claimed because the rats were given THC at the young age of 28 days, it is impossible to extrapolate the results of this study to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid%3A416164|title=Reefer Madness|first=Jordan|last=Smith|date=2006-11-03|accessdate=2007-05-13|publisher=The Austin Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, a 12-year gateway drug hypothesis study on 214 boys from ages 10–12 by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] was published in the [[American Journal of Psychiatry]].

In September 2010, a study from the [[University of New Hampshire]] examined survey data from 1,286 young adults who had attended [[Miami-Dade County Public Schools]] in the 1990s and found the association between teenage cannabis use and other illicit drug abuse by young adults was significantly diminished after controlling for other factors, such as unemployment. They found that after young adults reach age 21, the gateway effect subsides entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/09/100902073507.htm|publisher=[[Science Daily]]|date=2010-09-02|title=Risk of Marijuana's 'Gateway Effect' Overblown, New Research Shows|accessdate=2010-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increased crime ===
The [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) has claimed that cannabis leads to increased crime in the unsourced pamphlet entitled "Speaking Out Against Drug Legalization"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/demand/speakout/09so.htm|title=Fact 9: Europe's More Liberal Drug Policies Are Not the Right Model for America|publisher=[[Drug Enforcement Administration]]|accessdate=2007-04-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210122959/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/demand/speakout/09so.htm|archivedate=2007-02-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have found no evidence of a link between cannabis usage and an increase in crime, but rather have found cannabis may decrease criminal behavior when under the influence.&lt;ref name=nixonreport/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6484653.stm|title=Is cannabis really a killer?|first=Max|last=Daly|date=2007-03-23|accessdate=2007-04-17|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1973, a report by the [[National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse]] entitled "Marijuana: A Signal of Misunderstanding" found marijuana does not cause violent or aggressive behavior, but rather "marijuana was usually found to inhibit the expression of aggressive impulses by pacifying the user, interfering with muscular coordination, reducing psychomotor activities and generally producing states of drowsiness lethargy, timidity and passivity."&lt;ref name=nixonreport /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc1 /&gt;

In 2001, a report by David Boyum and [[Mark A.R. Kleiman]] entitled "Substance Abuse Policy from a Crime-Control Perspective" found the "high" from cannabis is unlikely to trigger violence and concluded:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucla.edu/faculty/kleiman/subabus.pdf|title=Substance Abuse Policy from a Crime-Control Perspective|author1=Boyum, David A.|author2=Mark A.R. Kleiman|year=2001|accessdate=2007-06-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150513041705/http://www.ucla.edu/faculty/kleiman/subabus.pdf|archivedate=2015-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Making marijuana legally available to adults on more or less the same terms as alcohol would tend to reduce crime, certainly by greatly shrinking the illicit market and possibly by reducing alcohol consumption via substitution if smoking marijuana acts, on balance, as a substitute for drinking alcohol rather than a complement to it since drinking seems to have a greater tendency to unleash aggression than does cannabis use.}}

In 2004, a study by Scott Bates from the Boreal Economic Analysis &amp; Research center entitled "The Economic Implications of Marijuana Legalization in Alaska", was prepared for Alaskans for Rights &amp; Revenues. The study found there was no link between cannabis use and criminal behavior.&lt;ref name="prohibcosts" /&gt;

A 2014 study published in [[PLoS ONE]] found that not only did the legalization of [[Medical cannabis]] did not increase violent crime, but that a 2.4% reduction in homicide and assault was found for each year the law was in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morris|title=The Effect of Medical Marijuana Laws on Crime: Evidence from State Panel Data, 1990-2006|journal=PLoS ONE|date=March 26, 2014|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0092816|display-authors=etal|volume=9|issue=3|pages=e92816|pmid=24671103|pmc=3966811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increased cannabis usage ===
The [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) has claimed that cannabis decriminalization will lead to increased cannabis use and addiction in the un-sourced pamphlet entitled "Speaking Out Against Drug Legalization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/demand/speakout/06so.htm|title=Speaking Out Against Drug Legalization, Fact 6|date=May 2006|publisher=[[Drug Enforcement Administration]]|accessdate=2007-03-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210094634/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/demand/speakout/06so.htm|archivedate=2007-02-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet states in 1979, after 11 states decriminalized private cannabis use, cannabis use among 12th grade students was almost 51 percent and in 1992, when stricter cannabis laws were put in place, the usage rate reduced to 22 percent. The pamphlet also states that when Alaska decriminalized cannabis in 1975, the cannabis use rate among youth eventually rose to twice the national average youth usage rate nationwide; even though the law did not apply to anyone under the age of 19, the pamphlet explains this is why Alaska re-criminalized cannabis in 1990. Save Our Society From Drugs (SOS) has also stated that decriminalizing cannabis will increase usage among teenagers, citing an increase in Alaskan youth cannabis usage when cannabis was decriminalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cbs4denver.com/local/local_story_263172020.html|title=Opponents Take Aim At Marijuana Amendment|publisher=[[CBS]]: Denver|date=2006-09-20|accessdate=2007-04-19 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060920215631/http://cbs4denver.com/local/local_story_263172020.html |archivedate = 2006-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, cannabis use rose in all states in the 1970s, and the DEA does not say whether or not Alaska started out higher than the national average. Following decriminalization, Alaska youth had lower rates of daily use of cannabis than their peers in the rest of the US.&lt;ref name="cedro-uva.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedro-uva.org/lib/harrison.cannabis.06.html |title=Marijuana policy and prevalence |publisher=Cedro-uva.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] commissioned the [[National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse]] to produce an in-depth report on cannabis. The report, entitled "Marijuana: A Signal of Misunderstanding", reviewed existing cannabis studies and concluded that cannabis does not cause physical addiction.&lt;ref name=nixonreport /&gt;

Studies conducted in Oregon, California, and Maine within a few years of decriminalization found little increase in cannabis use, compared to the rest of the country; "The most frequently cited reasons for non-use by respondents was 'not interested,' cited by about 80% of non-users. Only 4% of adults indicated fear of arrest and prosecution or unavailability as factors preventing use."&lt;ref name="cedro-uva.org"/&gt;

In 1997, the Connecticut Law Revision Commission examined states that had decriminalized cannabis and found any increase in cannabis usage was less than the increase in states that have not decriminalized cannabis; furthermore, the commission stated "the largest proportionate increase [of cannabis use] occurred in those states with the most severe penalties." The study recommended [[Connecticut]] reduce cannabis possession of 28.35 grams (one ounce) or less for adults age 21 and over to a civil fine.&lt;ref name="clr" /&gt;

In 1999, a study by the Division of Neuroscience and Behavioral Health at the [[Institute of Medicine]] entitled "Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base", concluded "there is little evidence that decriminalization of marijuana use necessarily leads to a substantial increase in marijuana use."&lt;ref name=IOM/&gt;&lt;!--REF: pg102--&gt;

In 2001, a report by [[Robert MacCoun]] and [[Peter Reuter]] entitled "Evaluating alternative cannabis regimes", was published in the [[British Journal of Psychiatry]]. The report found there was no available evidence cannabis use would increase if cannabis were decriminalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/178/2/123.pdf|title=Evaluating alternative cannabis regimes|website=bjp.rcpsych.org |publisher=British Journal of Psychiatry|year=2001|accessdate=2007-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a study entitled "The Limited Relevance of Drug Policy: Cannabis in Amsterdam and in San Francisco", found strict laws against cannabis use have a low impact on usage rates.&lt;ref name="ajph" /&gt;

=== Increased safety concerns ===
Studies conducted following the legalization of cannabis in Washington and Colorado show that driving under the effects of marijuana increases a driver's likelihood of getting in accident by 100% in comparison to sober drivers. They also suggest that increased use will lead to higher workplace accidents, with employees who tested positive for cannabis being 55% more likely to get in an accident, and 85% more likely to get injured on the job.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=124424502&amp;site=ehost-live "Public Health and Safety Issues Remain."] ''USA Today Magazine'', vol. 146, no. 2867, Aug. 2017, p. 12. EBSCO''host''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Big business ===
In a ''[[Huffington Post]]'' interview, [[Mark A.R. Kleiman|Mark Kleiman]], the "Pot Czar" of [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], said he was concerned that the [[National Cannabis Industry Association]] would favor profits over public health. He also said that it could become a predatory body like the lobbying arms of the tobacco and alcohol industries. Kleiman said: "The fact that the National Cannabis Industry Association has hired itself a [[K Street (Washington, D.C.)|K Street]] [[Lobbying in the United States|suit [lobbyist]]] is not a good sign."&lt;ref name=huffpo2&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/18/weed-legalization_n_5169750.html | work=Huffington Post | title=7 Things That Could Totally Kill Weed Legalization's Buzz | date=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy ==
Several U.S.-based advocate groups seek to modify the [[drug policy of the United States]] to decriminalize cannabis. These groups include [[Law Enforcement Against Prohibition]], [[Students for Sensible Drug Policy]], [[Drug Policy Alliance|The Drug Policy Alliance]], the [[Marijuana Policy Project]], [[NORML]], [[Coalition for Rescheduling Cannabis]], and [[Americans for Safe Access]]. There are also many individual American cannabis activists, such as [[Jack Herer]], [[Paul Armentano]], [[Edward Forchion]], [[Jon Gettman]], [[Rob Kampia]], and [[Keith Stroup]]; [[Marc Emery]], a well-known Canadian activist, has supported cannabis activism in the U.S. among other countries by donating money earned from ''[[Cannabis Culture magazine|Cannabis Culture]]'' magazine and Emeryseeds.com.

In 1997, the Connecticut Law Revision Commission recommended [[Connecticut]] reduce cannabis possession of one ounce or less for adults age 21 and over to a civil fine.&lt;ref name=clr /&gt; In 2001, the [[New Mexico]] state-commissioned Drug Policy Advisory Group stated that decriminalizing cannabis "will result in greater availability of resources to respond to more serious crimes without any increased risks to public safety."&lt;ref name=nm /&gt;

A few places in [[California]] have been advocating cannabis decriminalization.
On November 3, 2004, [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] passed Proposition Z, which makes "adult recreational marijuana use, cultivation and sales the lowest [city] law enforcement priority."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/election2004/archives/2004/11/proposition_z_w.html |title = Election 2004: Oakland Marijuana Measure in the Bag |publisher = journalism.berkeley.edu |accessdate = 2008-07-07 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080605031828/http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/election2004/archives/2004/11/proposition_z_w.html |archivedate = 2008-06-05 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposition states the city of Oakland must advocate to the state of California to adopt laws to regulate and tax cannabis.&lt;ref name="oakland_prop_z"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.smartvoter.org/2004/11/02/ca/alm/meas/Z/ |website=smartvoter.org|publisher=Smart Voter|title=Measure Z: Marijuana Law Enforcement - Alameda County, CA|accessdate=2006-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 7, 2006, [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] passed [[Measure K 2006|Measure K]], which made cannabis the lowest priority for city law enforcement. The measure requests the Santa Cruz City Clerk send letters annually to [[U.S. state|state]] and [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] representatives advocating reform of cannabis laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sensiblesantacruz.org/initiative.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106172530/http://www.sensiblesantacruz.org/initiative.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-01-06 |title=Measure K - Lowest Law Enforcement Priority Initiative: FAQ |website=sensiblesantacruz.org |publisher=Santa Cruz Citizens for Sensible Marijuana Policy |accessdate=2007-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 5, 2007, [[Mendocino County, California|Mendocino County]] Board of Supervisors voted 4-1 to send a letter in support of the legalization, regulation, and taxation of cannabis to [[U.S. state|state]] and [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] legislators, and the [[President of United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ukiahdailyjournal.com/ci_6074058|title=Marijuana legalization letter OK'd|first=Katie|last=Mintz|date=2007-06-06|accessdate=2007-06-11|publisher=Ukiah Daily Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ron Paul]], a former Texas Congressman and 2008 Presidential Candidate, stated at a rally in response to a question by a medical cannabis patient that he would "never use the federal government to force the law against anybody using marijuana."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AegRynzxQJA|title=Ron Paul on marijuana laws|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=2008-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book, ''[[The Revolution: A Manifesto]]'' he writes, "Regardless of where one stands on the broader drug war, we should all be able to agree on the subject of medical marijuana. Here, the use of an otherwise prohibited substance has been found to relieve unbearable suffering in countless patients. How can we fail to support liberty and individual responsibility in such a clear cut case? What harm does it do to anyone else to allow fellow human beings in pain to find the relief they need?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Revolution: A Manifesto|publisher=Grand Central Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also the cosponsor of the [[Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults Act of 2008]].

[[Mike Gravel]], a former [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]] from Alaska and [[Mike Gravel presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential candidate]], responded to a caller on a [[C-SPAN]] program asking about cannabis and the drug war, he stated "That one is real simple, I would legalize marijuana. You should be able to buy that at a liquor store."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KyFRyxZp-s|title=Part 2 - Mike Gravel - The Issues that Matter - Washington Journal.|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=2007-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dennis Kucinich]], a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. representative]] from [[Ohio]] and [[Dennis Kucinich#2008 Presidential campaign|2008 presidential candidate]], has been an advocate of cannabis legalization. During Kucinich's 2004 presidential campaign, the following was posted on Kucinich's official campaign web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/316/kucinich.shtml|title=Newsbrief: Campaign Watch -- Kucinich Says Legalize It|date=2003-12-19|accessdate=2007-06-13|website=stopthedrugwar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Most marijuana users do so responsibly, in a safe, recreational context. These people lead normal, productive lives — pursuing careers, raising families and participating in civic life ... A Kucinich administration would reject the current paradigm of 'all use is abuse' in favor of a drug policy that sets reasonable boundaries for marijuana use by establishing guidelines similar to those already in place for alcohol.}}

Some members of religious organizations, even while not necessarily being in favor of marijuana consumption, have also spoken in favor of reform, due to medical reasons, or the social costs of enforcement and incarceration.&lt;ref name=religionnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionnews.com/2014/02/03/faith-leaders-wrestle-growing-support-marijuana/ |title=Faith leaders wrestle over growing support for marijuana |publisher=Religion News Service |date=2014-02-03 |author=Sarah Pulliam Bailey |accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, Revered Samuel Rodriguez of National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conferences stated that "laws that prohibit marijuana affect the minorities significantly and hence should be reconsidered." Religious groups uphold that marijuana does not harm as much as alcohol does and thus legalizing it for medicinal usage would not be harmful to the economy.&lt;ref name=religionnews/&gt;

In 1974 Dr Robert DuPont began to publicly support decriminalization of cannabis, seeing cannabis as a health problem. But when DuPont left government he changed his mind and declared that "decriminalization is a bad idea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/interviews/dupont.html |title=WGBH educational foundation.

'''Dempsey''' (ca. 1986 - 2003) was a female [[American Pit Bull Terrier]] who was the subject of a high-profile challenge to the British [[Dangerous Dogs Act 1991]]. She was owned by Dianne Fanneran and lived in [[London]].

While being walked one evening in April 1992, [[animal muzzle|muzzle]]d and kept on a [[leash]] in accordance with the law, she began acting sick and her muzzle was removed, allegedly to allow her to vomit.

Two passing police officers noted the unmuzzled dog and charged the caretaker under the Dangerous Dogs Act. Three months later, at [[Ealing]] [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]], Dempsey was ordered to be [[animal euthanasia|euthanised]] for failing to be muzzled in a public place. 

Appeals took three years before the [[Crown Court]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/leading-article--love-dempsey-hate-pitbulls-1600011.html |title=Love Dempsey, hate pit-bulls |date=September 8, 1995 |website=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=July 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[High Court of England and Wales|High Court]] and the [[House of Lords]], during which time the media covered the story, not least [[Auberon Waugh]] in his ''Way of the World'' column in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]].''&lt;ref&gt;See for example "If Dempsey dies", May 3, 1995, where he described it as "a tale of such odious cruelty and stupidity as puts our entire legal system to shame" and "Dempsey's chance", September 9, 1995, where he described it as "a classic illustration of stupid laws stupidly enforced in a stupid society".&lt;/ref&gt;  Animal rights activist [[Brigitte Bardot]] offered the dog sanctuary at her home in France, to avoid British law.&lt;ref name=newshound&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Meara |first=Ryan |date=2009 |title=News Hounds: The Wackiest Dog Stories from Around the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgH5VaABS8MC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;lpg=PA148&amp;dq=bridget+bardot+dempsey+sanctuary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6Tip9QRHlh&amp;sig=WxPR7h_eTG-ByiUuddpaw5t5-mo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Rfa3U-KWKsnOkwXL3YCADw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=bridget%20bardot%20dempsey%20sanctuary&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=[[Globe Pequot Press|Lyons Press]] |page=148 |isbn=978-1599214788 |accessdate=July 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was dismissed in November 1995 on a [[legal technicality]], as it emerged that Dempsey's owner, not involved in the original incident, was unaware that the court hearing was taking place. This legal loophole meant the case was thrown out.

Dempsey was reprieved and died at the age of 17 in 2003.&lt;ref name=newshound/&gt;

==History==

Discovery Offices construction began construction on 1 March 2011 and is estimated to complete on 1 March 2015. The design was changed two times before the final design was decided upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/nirmal-lifestyle-mulls-10-bn-capex-over-a-decade-110052600166_1.html |title= The city-based real estate player Nirmal Lifestyle today said it has drawn up a $10 billion (Rs 47,000 crore) investment plan over the next decade with the Launch of the Discovery Offices. |work= business standard|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plot history===

Discovery Offices is a skyscraper located on the land previously owned by [[Nirmal Lifestyles|Nirmal Lifestyles Mall]] which is a Shopping Mall in [[Mulund]], [[Mumbai]] and is situated on [[Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg|L.B.S Marg]] and Mulund-Goregaon Link Road Crossing Square near the Nirmal Lifestyles Mall. Its land was used as the main parking lot for the [[Nirmal Lifestyles|Nirmal Lifestyles Mall]] from 2002 to 2010. On 1 March 2011 the ground breaking ceremony took place and the construction of the Discovery Offices began.

==Location==

Discovery Offices is situated on [[Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg|L.B.S Marg]] and Mulund-Goregaon Link Road Crossing Square near the Nirmal Lifestyles Mall. It is about 7&amp;nbsp;km from [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mumbai.iproperty.com/search/search_detail/45467-Commercial-Office-Space-at-Mulund-West-from-Nirmal-Lifestyle.html |title= Location of the Discovery Offices Building |publisher= iproperty |accessdate= 17 March 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130411051905/http://mumbai.iproperty.com/search/search_detail/45467-Commercial-Office-Space-at-Mulund-West-from-Nirmal-Lifestyle.html |archivedate= 11 April 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated in [[Mulund]] which is a developing area and has well planned civic amenities and world class planned infrastructure. The reason to construct the Discovery Offices in this area was mainly because it is an upcoming deed area of [[Mumbai]]. However, Mulund lacks world class commercial offices and has very few types of offices.

==Design==

The Discovery Offices towers lean in opposite directions (five degrees from center) adjacent. It is a 50 Floors Skyscrapers used for Commercial Office and it is being build by Nirmal Construction Pvt Ltd.Discovery Offices architect is an Indian famous architect firm [[Hafeez Contractor]] who is also its Structural Engineers. Nirmal Construction Pvt Ltd has mad a contract with [[Discovery Communications]] to construct one of the India's First [[supertall]] Skyscrapers to achieve a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] Platinum rating for environmental sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.pubarticles.com/mulund-discovery-commercial-project-nirmal-lifestyle-discovery-commercial-property-1303992877,155047.html |title= Nirmal Lifestyle Limited has enters into a first of its kind licensing pact with Discovery Channel to launch Discovery branded Eco friendly realty in India with the Launch of the Discovery Offices in Mulund Mumbai,India. |publisher= pubarticles |accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the India's Most Eco-Friendly Design [[supertall]] Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fountainhead2.com/media.html |title= Nirmal Construction goes Green with the Discovery Offices towers |publisher= fountainhead2 |accessdate= 17 March 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131003043225/http://fountainhead2.com/media.html |archivedate= 3 October 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the tallest building in [[Mulund]] and also the tallest building in [[Eastern Suburbs (Mumbai)]] under construction and when completed. It has a total height of {{convert|205|m|ft|0}} and a total floor area of {{convert|1700000|sqft|abbr=on}}. The construction started on the begin early in 1 March 2011 and is estimated to complete on 1 March 2015. The Discovery Offices towers has a normally ceiling height of {{convert|4|m|ft|0}}. Its first 10 floors will be used as [[Car Parking System|Car Parking]] floors, and the remaining 40 floors from 11th floor to 50th floor will be used as commercial office and ground will be used as a grand lobby and for also other spaces. It will house a total unit of 470 office units, which will range from {{convert|570|sqft|abbr=on}} {{convert|25000|sqft|abbr=on}}. The total cost of the Discovery Offices towers is estimated is around {{INRConvert|10|b}}.

The Discovery Offices towers has amenities like Discovery gym with steam/sauna, landscape garden with jogging track, conference halls, mini food court, 24x7 security, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nirmallifestyle.com/NirmalDiscovery/amenities.php?ldm_campaign_id=4&amp;ldm_banner_size=300x250&amp;ldm_source_of_lead=Corporate |title= Discovery Offices:-About Us Amenities |publisher= nirmallifestyle |accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has eco-friendly design features solar energy for common area, rainwater harvesting, waste water treatment, large windows for natural light, potable water in taps, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nirmallifestyle.com/NirmalDiscovery/specification.php?ldm_campaign_id=4&amp;ldm_banner_size=300x250&amp;ldm_source_of_lead=Corporate |title= Discovery Offices:-About Us Specification |publisher= nirmallifestyle |accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eco-friendly design features==

The design of the building makes it environmentally friendly, using technologies such as floor-to-ceiling insulated glazing to contain heat and maximize natural light, and an automatic daylight dimming system. The tower also features a greywater system, which captures rainwater for reuse. Nirmal Construction Pvt Ltd. states that the building is made largely of recycled and recyclable materials. Air entering the building is filtered, as is common, but the air exhausted is cleaned as well. The Discovery Offices Building is one of the first [[supertall]] in [[India]] to achieve a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] Platinum rating for environmental sustainability a Platinum (LEED) Certification from [[Green Building Council]].

The Discovery Offices Building is constructed using a concrete manufactured with [[slag]], a byproduct of [[blast furnaces]]. The mixture used in the tower concrete is 55% cement and 45% slag. The use of slag cement reduces damage to the environment by decreasing the amount of cement needed for the building, which in turn lowers the amount of carbon dioxide [[greenhouse gas]] produced through the normal cement manufacturing process. Each ton of regular cement produced creates about one ton of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Temperature control and the production of some of its energy are accomplished in an environmentally friendly manner for the tower. Insulated glazing reduces thermal loss, lowering energy consumption and increasing transparency. Carbon dioxide sensors signal increased fresh air ventilation when elevated levels of carbon dioxide are detected in the building.Conditioned air for the occupants is provided by multiple air column units located in the tenant space that deliver {{convert|50|°F|°C|abbr=on}} air into a raised access floor plenum. This underfloor air system provides users with the ability to control their own space temperature as well as improving the ventilation effectiveness. When building churn occurs, workstation moves can be performed more easily with lower cost and less product waste. The cooling system produces and stores ice during off-peak hours, and allows the ice to melt to help cool the building during [[peak load]], similar to the ice batteries in the 1995 [[Hotel New Otani]] in Tokyo, Japan. Ice batteries have been used since absorption chillers first made ice commercially available 150 years ago, before the invention of the electric light bulb.

Water conservation features in the tower include waterless [[urinals]], which are estimated to save {{convert|8000000|gal|l|abbr=on}} of water per year and reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by {{convert|144000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} per year. The tower has a 4.6-megawatt [[cogeneration]] plant, which provides part of the base-load energy requirements. Onsite power generation reduces the significant electrical transmission losses that are typical of central power production plants. Some of its other Eco-Friendly Design Features include's Solar energy for common area, Rain water harvesting, Waste water treatment, Large windows for natural light, Potable water in taps, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.window2india.com/cms/property/w2i-nirmallifestyle.jsp |title= Discovery Offices eco-friendly features.|publisher= window2india |accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==

Discovery Offices Construction Started on begin early in 1 March 2011 and is Estimated to complete on 1 March 2015. Its architect Design was changed two times before coming to the finale design. But as of 2013 it Scheduled to complete on 1, march, 2016 a delayed caused due to local authorities and technical problems.

An '''economic partnership agreement''' is an [[trade agreement|economic arrangement]] that eliminates [[trade barrier|barriers]] to the free movement of [[Good (economics)|goods]], [[Service (economics)|services]], and [[investment]] between countries. This agreement can be considered an intermediate step between [[free trade area]] and [[single market]] in the process of [[economic integration]]. Economic partnerships are sometimes described as ''high standard'' variants of free trade agreements.

One example is the Japan-Mexico Economic Partnership Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mofa.go.jp/POLICY/economy/fta/mexico.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Equitable remedies''' are [[judicial remedies]] developed by courts of [[Equity (law)|equity]] from about the time of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] to provide more flexible responses to changing social conditions than was possible in [[precedent]]-based [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Constitutional History of England | author = [[Frederic William Maitland|F W Maitland]] | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 1908 | pages = 221–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Discipline of Law | author = [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] | publisher = [[Butterworths]] | isbn = 0406176051 | year = 1979 | page = 197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Judicial remedies}}
Equitable remedies were granted by the [[Court of Chancery]] in [[England]], and remain available today in most common law jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions, legal and equitable remedies have been merged and a single court can issue either, or both, remedies. Despite widespread judicial merger, the distinction between equitable and legal remedies remains relevant in a number of significant instances. Notably, the [[United States Constitution]]'s [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]] preserves the right to a jury trial in civil cases over $20 to cases "at common law".

The distinction between types of relief granted by the courts is due to the courts of equity, such as the Court of Chancery in England, and still available today in [[common law]] jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Meagher and Gummow, ''Equity, Doctrines and Remedies'', 3rd ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Equity is said to operate on the conscience of the defendant, so an equitable remedy is always directed at a particular person, and that person's knowledge, state of mind and motives may be relevant to whether a remedy should be granted or not.

Equitable remedies are distinguished from "legal" remedies (which are available to a successful claimant as of right) by the discretion of the court to grant them.  In common law jurisdictions, there are a variety of equitable remedies, but the principal remedies are:
# [[injunction]]&lt;ref&gt;In English law, see generally ''American Cyanimid Co v Ethicon'' [1975] AC 396&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also, {{cite AustLII|HCA|1|1968|litigants=Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[specific performance]]
# [[account of profits]]
# [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]]
# [[rectification (law)|rectification]]
# [[equitable estoppel]]
# certain proprietary remedies, such as [[constructive trusts]]&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Oakley, ''Constructive Trusts'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[subrogation]]
# in very specific circumstances, an [[Security interest#Equitable lien|equitable lien]].&lt;ref name="Giumelli"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|10|1999|litigants=[[Giumelli v Giumelli]] |parallelcite=(1999) 196 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 101 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# equitable [[Damages|compensation]]
# appointment or removal of [[fiduciary]]
#[[interpleader]]

The two main equitable remedies are [[injunctions]] and specific performance, and in casual legal parlance references to equitable remedies are often expressed as referring to those two remedies alone.  Injunctions may be mandatory (requiring a person to do something) or prohibitory (stopping them doing something). Specific performance requires a party to perform a contract, for example by transferring a piece of land to the claimant. The award of specific performance requires that the two following criteria must be satisfied:&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, Degeling, Donald and Vann, ''A Sourcebook on Equity and Trusts in Australia,'' Cambridge University Press pp. 24-31.&lt;/ref&gt; (i) Common law damages must be an inadequate remedy. For instance, when damages for a breach of contract found in favour of a third party are an inadequate remedy.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Coulls v Bagot's Executor &amp; Trustee Co Ltd (1967) 119 CLR [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1967/3.html AustLII]&lt;/ref&gt; (ii) No bars to equitable relief prevent specific performance. A bar to relief arises for example, when the court's continuous supervision of the defendant is not feasible.&lt;ref&gt;See, {{cite BAILII|litigants=Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd v Argyll Stores |year=1997 |court=UKHL |num=17 |parallelcite=[1998] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 1 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An account of profits is usually ordered where payment of damages would still leave the wrongdoer [[unjust enrichment|unjustly enriched]] at the expense of the wronged party. However, orders for an account are not normally available as of right, and only arise in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[[Goff &amp; Jones]], ''The Law of Restitution'', 4th ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rescission and rectification are remedies in relation to [[contract]]s (or, exceptionally, [[deed]]s) which may become available.

Constructive trusts and tracing remedies are usually used where the claimant asserts that property has been wrongly appropriated from them, and then either (i) the property has increased in value, and thus they should have an interest in the increase in value which occurred at their expense, or (ii) the property has been transferred by the wrongdoer to an innocent third party, and the original owner should be able to claim a right to the property as against the innocent third party.

Equitable liens normally only arise in very specific factual circumstances, such as unpaid vendor's lien.

Equitable principles can also limit the granting of equitable remedies.  This includes [[unclean hands|"he who comes to equity must come with clean hands"]] (that is, the court will not assist a claimant who is himself in the wrong or acting for improper motives), [[Laches (equity)|laches]] (equitable remedies will not be granted if the claimant has delayed unduly in seeking them), "equity will not assist a volunteer" (meaning that a person cannot litigate against a settlor without providing the appropriate consideration, for example, Money) and that equitable remedies will not normally be granted where [[damages]] would be an adequate remedy.  The most important limitation relating to equitable remedies is that an equitable remedy will not lie against a [[bona fide purchaser for value without notice]].

Damages can also be awarded in "equity" as opposed to "at law",&lt;ref&gt;''Mcgregor on Damages'', 17th rev ed.&lt;/ref&gt; and in some legal systems, by historical accident, interest on damages can be awarded on a compound basis only on equitable damages, but not on damages awarded at law.&lt;ref&gt;''Westdeutsche v Islington BC'' [1996] AC 669&lt;/ref&gt;  However, most jurisdictions either have ended this anachronism, or evinced an intention to do so, by modernising legislation. Two versions of the legislation are in force in Australian jurisdiction with one version placing emphasis on "commission of a wrongful act" and the other omits the reference to wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''Supreme Court Act 1970'' (NSW) s 68 and ''Supreme Court Act 1986'' (Vic) s 38. See also, {{cite AustLII|HCA|41|1982|litigants=Wentworth v Woollahra Municipal Council |parallelcite=(1982) 149 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 672 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification of a remedy as equitable has various consequences. For example, equitable remedies may be enforced by contempt,&lt;ref&gt;International Union, United Mine Workers of America v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; and equitable remedies are subject to equitable defenses.&lt;ref name="Little Bit of Laches"&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=2376080 |title=A Little Bit of Laches Goes a Long Way: Notes on Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. |volume=67 |page=1 |journal=[[Vanderbilt Law Review En Banc]] |first=Samuel |last=Bray|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1774">The '''European Payment Order''' (EPO) is a system of cross-border [[Debt collection|debt-collecting]] methods established on December 11, 2006 that is used in the [[European Union]].

==Uses==
The European Payment Order is only available for cross-border cases. It allows for citizens and businesses to use a simple method to enforce uncontested payments. [[Small business]]es in particular should benefit from the EPO since it provides a simple, cost-effective method of collecting payments from a multinational group of customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&amp;type=IM-PRESS&amp;reference=20061002IPR11283| title=Go-ahead for the European Payment Order| date=March 10, 2006| accessdate=2008-03-26| publisher=European Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local law==
[[Expense and Cost Recovery System (ECRS)|Local debt-recovering systems]] work alongside the European Payment Order. [[Creditor]]s can choose which system they wish to use. One of the biggest benefits of using the European Payment Order is that it is specifically designed to work in multinational scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lindorff.com/com/mainpage/news/article15113.ece |title=EU Member States to implement a common debt recovery procedure |date=December 12, 2006 |accessdate=2007-03-09 |publisher=Lindorff |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206011723/http://www.lindorff.com/com/mainpage/news/article15113.ece |archivedate=2007-02-06 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Family law''' (also called '''matrimonial law''' or the ''law of domestic relations'') is an area of the [[law]] that deals with [[family]] matters and [[domestic relations]].&lt;ref name="abafl"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Atkinson|first1=Jeff|title=ABA Family Legal Guide|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/publiced/practical/books/family/chapter_3.authcheckdam.pdf|website=American Bar Association|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''green wall''' is a wall partially or completely covered with greenery that includes a growing medium, such as soil or a substrate. Most green walls also feature an integrated water delivery system.  A green wall is also known as a '''living wall''' or '''vertical garden'''. It provides insulation to keep the building's inside temperature consistent.

It is useful to distinguish green ''walls'' from green ''facades''. Green walls have growing media supported on the face of the wall (as described below), while green facades have soil only at the base of the wall (in a container or in ground) and support climbing plants on the face of the wall to create the green, or vegetated, facade.

Green walls may be indoors or outside, freestanding or attached to an existing wall, and come in a great variety of sizes.

[[Stanley Hart White]], a Professor of Landscape Architecture at the [[University of Illinois]] patented a "vegetation-Bearing Architectonic Structure and System" in 1938, though his invention did not progress beyond prototypes in his backyard in Urbana, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grahamfoundation.org/grantees/4834-reconstructing-the-vegetation-bearing-architectonic-structure-and-system-1938 | title=Reconstructing the 'Vegetation-Bearing Architectonic Structure and System (1938)' | publisher=Graham Foundation | accessdate=February 20, 2013 | author=Hindle, Richard L.}}

[[Patrick Blanc]], a botanist specialized in tropical forest undergrowth, worked with architect [[Adrien Fainsilber]] and engineer [[Peter Rice]] implementing the first successful large indoors green wall in 1986 at the [[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie]] in Paris. In 2005, he created the landmark vegetal exterior wall of the administrative building of the [[Musée du quai Branly]] with architect [[Jean Nouvel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-14/pune/37099689_1_vertical-gardens-private-garden-conventional-garden | title=Vertical gardens a green solution for urban setting | publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co., Ltd. | work=The Times of India | date=Feb 14, 2013 | accessdate=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verticalgardenpatrickblanc.com/?_ga=1.1418609.1566044096.1483650856|title=Welcome to Vertical Garden Patrick Blanc – Vertical Garden Patrick Blanc|website=www.verticalgardenpatrickblanc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Green walls subsequently saw a rapid surge in popularity. Of the 61 large-scale outdoor green walls listed in an online database provided by greenroof.com, 80% were constructed in or after 2009 and 93% in or after 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenroofs.com/projects/ | title=The International Greenroof &amp; Greenwall Projects Database! | publisher=Greenroofs.com, LLC | work=greenroofs.com | accessdate=17 October 2013|quote=select 'green wall' as type and 'living wall' under 'greenroof type'}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many iconic green walls have been constructed by institutions and in public places such as airports and are now becoming common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.airport-world.com/home/all-news/item/2414-upwards-trend | title=Upwards trend  | publisher=Airport World | work=www.airport-world.com | accessdate=29 March 2013 &lt;!-- 05:00 --&gt; |quote=An increasing number of airports are investing in vertical gardens and living walls to create a unique setting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the largest green wall covers 2,700 square meters (29,063 square feet or more than half an acre) and is located at the Los Cabos International Convention Center, a building designed by Mexican architect [[Fernando Romero]] for the [[2012 G-20 Los Cabos summit]].&lt;ref&gt;For largest wall as of 2012, see {{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-19/calderon-fetes-g-20-as-sun-sets-on-mexican-ruling-party-s-power.html | title=Calderon Fetes G-20 as Sun Sets on Mexico Ruling Party | publisher=Bloomberg LP | work=bloomberg.com | date=Jun 20, 2012 | accessdate=17 October 2013 |author1=Eric Martin  |author2=Nacha Cattan}}

==Media types==

Green walls are often constructed of modular panels that hold a growing medium and can be categorized according to the type of growth media used: loose media, mat media, and structural media.

===Loose media===
Loose medium walls tend to be "soil-on-a-shelf" or "soil-in-a-bag" type systems.  Loose medium systems have their soil packed into a shelf or bag and are then installed onto the wall.  These systems require their media to be replaced at least once a year on exteriors and approximately every two years on interiors.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  Loose soil systems are not well suited for areas with any seismic activity.  Most importantly, because these systems can easily have their medium blown away by wind-driven rain or heavy winds, these should not be used in applications over 8 feet high.  There are some systems in Asia that have solved the loose media erosion problem by use of shielding systems to hold the media within the green wall system even when soil liquefaction occurs under seismic load.  In these systems, the plants can still up-root themselves in the liquified soil under seismic load, and therefore it is required that the plants be secured to the system to prevent them from falling from the wall.  Loose-soil systems without physical media erosion systems are best suited for the home gardener where occasional replanting is desired from season to season or year to year.  Loose-soil systems with physical media erosion systems are well suited for all green wall applications.

===Mat media===
Mat type systems tend to be either coir fiber or felt mats.  Mat media are quite thin, even in multiple layers, and as such cannot support vibrant root systems of mature plants for more than three to five years before the roots overtake the mat and water is not able to adequately wick through the mats.  The method of reparation of these systems is to replace large sections of the system at a time by cutting the mat out of the wall and replacing it with new mat.  This process compromises the root structures of the neighboring plants on the wall and often kills many surrounding plants in the reparation process.  These systems are best used on the interior of a building and are a good choice in areas with low seismic activity and small plants that will not grow to a weight that could rip the mat apart under their own weight over time.  It is important to note that mat systems are particularly water inefficient and often require constant irrigation due to the thin nature of the medium and its inability to hold water and provide a buffer for the plant roots.  This inefficiency often requires that these systems have a water re-circulation system put into place at an additional cost.  Mat media are better suited for small installations no more than eight feet in height where repairs are easily completed.

=== Sheet media ===
Semi-open cell polyurethane sheet media utilising an egg crate pattern has successfully been used in recent years for both outdoor roof gardens and vertical walls. The water holding capacity of these engineered polyurethanes vastly exceeds that of coir and felt based systems. Polyurethanes do not biodegrade, and hence stay viable as an active substrate for 20+ years. Vertical wall systems utilising polyurethane sheeting typically employ a sandwich construction where a water proof membrane is applied to the back, the polyurethane sheeting (typically two sheets with irrigation lines in between) is laid and then a mesh or anchor braces/bars secure the assembly to the wall. Pockets are cut into the face of the first urethane sheet into which plants are inserted. Soil is typically removed from the roots of any plants prior to insertion into the urethane mattress substrate. A flaked or chopped noodle version of the same polyurethane material can also be added to existing structural media mixes to boost water retention.

===Structural media===

}}
Structural media are growth medium "blocks" that are not loose, nor mats, but which incorporate the best features of both into a block that can be manufactured into various sizes, shapes and thicknesses.  These media have the advantage that they do not break down for 10 to 15 years, can be made to have a higher or lower water holding capacity depending on the plant selection for the wall, can have their pH and EC's customized to suit the plants, and are easily handled for maintenance and replacement.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

There is also some discussion involving "active" living walls.  An active living wall actively pulls or forces air through the plants le quality to the point that the installation of other air quality filtration systems can be removed to provide a cost-savings.  Therefore, the added cost of design, planning and implementation of an active living wall is still in question.  With further research and UL standards to support the air quality data from the living wall, building code may one day allow for our buildings to have their air filtered by plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.purdue.edu/inhome/#house|title=Purdue Solar Decathlon|website=www.purdue.edu|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area of air quality and plants is continuing to be researched.  Early studies in this area include NASA studies performed in the 1970s and 1980s by B. C. Wolverton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolvertonenvironmental.com/bcw.htm|title=Wolverton Environmental Services|website=www.wolvertonenvironmental.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was also a study performed at the University of Guelph by Alan Darlington.&lt;ref&gt;Indoor Air |Darlington, A.; Chan, M.; Malloch, D.; Dixon, M. A. Indoor Air 2000, 10, 39-46&lt;/ref&gt;  Other research has shown the effect the plants have on the health of office workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Effect of Indoor Foliage Plants on Health and Discomfort Symptoms among Office Workers| url= http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Doi=24583 | accessdate = 2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
[[File:Ronald Lu &amp; Partners Green Wall.jpg|thumb|260px|An indoor green wall in an office in [[Hong Kong]]]]
Green walls are found most often in [[Urban area|urban environments]] where the plants reduce overall temperatures of the building. "The primary cause of heat build-up in cities is [[insolation]], the absorption of solar radiation by roads and buildings in the city and the storage of this heat in the building material and its subsequent re-radiation. Plant surfaces however, as a result of transpiration, do not rise more than 4–5 °C above the ambient and are sometimes cooler."&lt;ref&gt;Ong, B.  (2003).  Green plot ratio: an ecological measure for architecture and urban planning.  ''Landscape and Urban Planning'', 63 (4).  Retrieved June 19, 2009, from ScienceDirect database.&lt;/ref&gt;

Living walls may also be a means for water reuse. The plants may purify slightly polluted water (such as [[greywater]]) by absorbing the dissolved nutrients. Bacteria mineralize the organic components to make them available to the plants.  A study is underway at the Bertschi School in Seattle, Washington, using a GSky Pro Wall system, however, no publicly available data on this is available at this time.

Living walls are particularly suitable for cities, as they allow good use of available vertical surface areas. They are also suitable in arid areas, as the circulating water on a vertical wall is less likely to evaporate than in horizontal gardens.

The living wall could also function for [[urban agriculture]], [[urban horticulture|urban gardening]], or for its beauty as [[art]]. It is sometimes built indoors to help alleviate [[sick building syndrome]].

Living walls are also acknowledged for remediation of poor air quality, both to internal and external areas.

'''Gunnar Beck''' is a [[Germany|German]] [[European Union law|EU and constitutional lawyer]], legal philosopher and publicist. 

== Professional career ==
Gunnar Beck read politics, philosophy, law and economics in Germany and Great Britain and completed his doctorate in political and legal philosophy under the supervision of Professor Sir [[Isaiah Berlin]] in 1996 at [[Nuffield College]], Oxford. He subsequently worked for the international law firm [[Herbert Smith]] and as Deputy Legal Adviser (EU law) at the House of Commons of the United Kingdom Parliament. He currently combines academic work with legal practice as a specialist EU lawyer. He is a barrister specialising in EU law at 1 Essex Court (Chambers of The Rt Hon Sir Tony Baldry), Temple, London, was appointed Professor of Law at the University of Sussex in 2016 and has been teaching EU law at SOAS University of London since 2005. He previously taught EU law, political philosophy and international relations at Oxford University and the LSE.

== Work ==
In ''Fichte and Kant on Freedom, Rights, and Law'' (2008) Beck argues that, contrary to the received view, Kant fails to demonstrate how political liberalism is logically connected and deduced from the doctrine of autonomy, whilst Fichte anticipates many of [[Hegel]]’s criticisms of Kant. Starting from a notion of the self which is constituted inter-subjectively Fichte ultimately rejects a notion of individual rights as absolute standards and constraints on legitimate political action. If the self is constituted inter-subjectively and develops historically in interaction with others, rights become the adaptable enabling conditions of moral, cultural and political progress. Fichte’s theory of rights, Beck argues in the Chinese edition to his book, is particularly relevant to sophisticated non-liberal societies like China where the ruling party has long rebutted Western criticism of human rights violations on the grounds that the ‘first right’ of every Chinese which trumps all others, is the right to a basic standard of living. For Fichte the first and fundamental right of all individuals is the right to the conditions of human perfectibility which include certain propitious material or social living conditions which are essential to basic human flourishing in circumstances of limited benevolence. In common with Hegel Fichte further thought that altruism and social solidarity could flourish only in communities based on common culture and shared historical destiny. Fichte may therefore not only be regarded as one of the fathers of [[nationalism]] but likewise merits attention as an early advocate of the doctrine that socialism is only possible in one country and that, in that sense, socialism is closely linked to nationalism. As a pre-Revolutionary thinker, by contrast, Kant, unlike Fichte or Hegel, never accommodated the notion of the nation as a culturally and linguistically defined entity within his broader moral and political theory, although his later writings on history are more sociologically and anthropologically sensitive than commonly acknowledged.

In ''The Legal Reasoning of the Court of Justice of the EU'' (2013) Beck argues that the problem of legal uncertainty is ultimately incapable of judicial or even doctrinal resolution. At the primary level of legal rules Beck identifies three basic sources of legal uncertainty: linguistic [[vagueness]], [[value pluralism]] and norm conflict, and [[precedent]] instability. Primary legal uncertainty gives rise to the need for judicial interpretation. Judges do not openly decide in accordance with political or personal preference; they are expected to justify their decision by reference to interpretative ''[[topoi]]'' or arguments, which fall into three main categories: linguistic, systemic and purposive, in addition to precedents. There is no overarching rule or formula governing the application of these ''topoi'', e.g. which type of argument prevails in which circumstances. Judges, in consequence, enjoy considerable discretion in the application of the available [[topoi]] and over which ''topos'' should enjoy primacy in which sets of circumstances.

The lack of any methodological certainty in the application of the interpretative criteria ultimately means the problem of legal uncertainty is incapable of complete resolution. As there is no agreed method of judicial reasoning, legal reasoning cannot be scientific but must remain ''heuristic''. Against the background of his general analysis of the nature and limits of legal reasoning Beck demonstrates that vagueness, norm conflict and precedent instability are pervasive features of [[European Union]] law. The whole second part of Beck’s book is devoted to an extensive review of the Court of Justice’s case law. Beck concludes that the Court resolves the high degree of legal uncertainty in a broadly ''communautaire'' or integrationist direction. The key to the Court of Justice’s restrained integrationism, according to Beck, is its cumulative interpretative approach by which it approaches interpretative problem from the combined perspective, and justifies its decisions in terms of the cumulative weight, of literal, systemic and purposive criteria. Purposive and especially meta-telelogical considerations assume greater weight in the Court of Justice’s legal reasoning than in the decisions of most higher national courts. The added weight given to teleology generally favours a more rather than less integrationist judicial response to most interpretative questions. In that sense the Court of Justice of the EU has been an important motor of EU integration, although Beck qualifies his conclusion in several respects: i. the EU treaties and secondary legislation are characterised by a high degree of vagueness and value pluralism which embody political compromises between member states whereby they effectively delegated key questions to the Court of Justice - such delegation of political questions to judicial authorities is dubious from a democratic point of view, ii. in areas of political and budgetary sensitivity the Court of Justice often shows limited or specific deference to member states on the very specific issues in the case, whilst endorsing a broadly integrationist general principle of law which affords for flexible application especially through the dummy standard of the proportionality principle, and iii. national constitutional courts often follow a similarly textually ‘creative’ and politically deferential interpretative approach in politically charged cases involving issues of EU integration or budgetary and social policy issues in which the political executive has invested considerable political capital. Legal reasoning, Beck concludes, is ordinary legal reasoning in extraordinary language, and judicial decision-making is subject not to rules, but to regularities – political as well as psychological, rhetorical no less than methodological regularities. Elsewhere, Beck has argued that for these reasons the rule of law always remains a 'fair weather phenomenon'. Where the Court of Justice of the EU differs from most other courts is in its communautaire predisposition to resolve most legal issues in a pro-integration direction, sometimes in direct defiance of the ordinary meaning of EU treaty and legislative provisions and frequently in direct opposition to the established rules of treaty interpretation contained in Art. 31 and 32 Vienna Convention on the Laws of Treaties.
	 
Gunnar Beck has written widely on the legal and economic aspects of the euro crisis. For Beck the crisis has brought to the fore an unprecedented breakdown in the rule of law and representative democracy in post-WW II Europe, which is epitomized by the only thinly disguised political role played by central banks and the EU and national courts. Under its President Mario Draghi the European Central Bank, with the tacit support of eurozone governments, has openly disregarded the limits of its mandate which is confined to monetary policy. With its quantitative easing and extreme low interest rates policies the ECB incrementally expropriates savers and fuels asset price bubbles, corporate short-termism and the misallocation of capital within the financial and wider corporate sectors. For Beck the delegation of far-reaching political and economic policy-making functions to ''soi-disant'' independent institutions and central bankers who, in many cases, have longstanding links with leading investments banks notably Goldman Sachs, together with the hollowing out of democratic processes and judicial deference in the highest national and supra-national courts, are key features of [[oligarchic]] democracy which is rapidly becoming the established form of government in Western Europe and North America.

Beck has also criticised the judicial response to the euro crisis. In a series of judgment the Court of Justice of the EU and the German Constitutional Court have upheld the establishment of a permanent euro zone financial bail-out fund by the member states and a multi-trillion government and corporate bond-buying programme by the European Central Bank which are contrary to Article 123 and 125 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). He argues that whilst there are many cases where treaties and legislation display a degree of linguistic uncertainty which grants de facto discretion to courts which is an undesirable but sometimes inevitable feature of law-making, Article 125 TFEU and Article 123 TFEU together with Council Regulation 3603/93 do not fall into this country. Art. 125 clearly prohibits the provision of mutual financial assistance amongst members of the euro zone or the establishment of aid mechanisms whereby one or more euro members assume liability for the debts of others, whilst Art. 123 in conjunction with Regulation 3603/93 was included in the Treaties to prevent the ECB from buying government bonds if such purchases may ease the refinancing conditions of indebted euro zone governments. In upholding the legality of both the establishment of a mutual financial assistance fund and the ECB's multi-trillion quantitative easing programme, the German Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice of the EU have exceeded the legitimate limits of judicial discretion which are defined by imprecision and vagueness in the underlying laws and adopted a [[contra legem]] interpretation of the Treaties, i.e. an interpretation which runs counter to the literal meaning of the Treaty. They have taken the crucial step from legitimate legal interpretation to judicial law-breaking.
	 
Beck who is an advocate of "organic" integration which should not have a pre-determined outcome, argues that the top-down approach to ‘ever closer union’ undermines self-government at every level of politics and reinforces the long-term trends towards electoral apathy and towards a debased consumer conception of the citizen. It reinforces many of the degenerative political and social trends in contemporary Western political societies, notably the susceptibility of governments to excessive and non-transparent lobbying, especially by the financial sector, the dismantlement of the post-war Western European model of the [[social market economy]], and the erosion of traditional de-centralized and historically evolved foundations of social solidarity and the hollowing out of residual forms of representative democracy and meaningful political participation. Further EU integration will bring Western and Central Europe closer to the consumerist homogenization of the United States, but without the early self-reliance, dynamism and even idealism of the Americans.

In addition to his legal and political scholarship, Gunnar Beck provides legal advice and representation in matters of EU law. He has been involved in select recent EU General Court, Court of Justice and UK Supreme cases involving innovative EU legal points or the division of competences between national and Union law.

As part of a consent order with federal bank regulators, the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)]], the [[Office of Thrift Supervision|Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS)]] (independent bureaus of the U.S. Department of the Treasury), and the [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]], fourteen mortgage servicers and their affiliates are identifying customers who were part of a foreclosure action on their primary residence between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2010.

The Federal Reserve announced on April 9 that [[Rust Consulting]] would begin mailing out checks on April 12, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://foreclosurehelpscc.wordpress.com/2013/04/09/cash-payments-for-independent-foreclosure-review-will-begin-being-mailed-april-12-senate-banking-{{Not a typo|comit|tee}}-will-hold-hearing-about-the-independent-foreclosure-reviews/&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 25, 2013, Representative Elijah Cummings introduced legislation to create a monitor for the Independent Foreclosure Review: HR 1706, "The Mortgage Settlement Monitoring Act of 2013"&lt;ref&gt;http://foreclosurehelpscc.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/new-federal-bill-introduced-to-create-independent-monitor-to-oversee-independent-foreclosure-review/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Independent Foreclosure Review provides homeowners the opportunity to request an independent review of their foreclosure process. If the review finds that financial injury occurred because of errors or other problems during their home foreclosure process, the homeowners may receive compensation or other remedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Foreclosure Review FAQ Page|url=https://independentforeclosurereview.com/Faqs.aspx|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and timeline==
On February 28, 2013, the OCC and the Federal Reserve announced a replacement program for 13 banks and servicers, while 3 of the original banks decided to keep the Independent Foreclosure Review Process.  The replacement program includes [[US$]]3.6 billion in direct cash payments to homeowners and $5.7 billion in loss mitigation assistance intended to keep people in their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Independent Foreclosure Review: Update on $3.6 Billion in Cash Payments and $5.7 Billion in Modification Assistance http://foreclosurehelpscc.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/independent-foreclosure-review-update-on-3-6-billion-in-cash-payments-and-5-7-billion-in-modification-assistance/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Independent Foreclosure Review was created in response to the [[Foreclosuregate|Foreclosure Crisis of 2010]] in an attempt to provide aid to homeowners who had either received their Notice of Default, or were in danger of foreclosure.

On April 13, 2011, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]], and the Office of Thrift Supervision announced enforcement actions against 14 large residential mortgage servicers and two third-party vendors for unsafe and unsound practices related to residential mortgage servicing and foreclosure processing; customers of 27 mortgage servicers (listed below) may be  eligible for compensation.

The third-party consultant assessed whether any errors, misrepresentations, or other deficiencies resulted in financial injury to borrowers. Where a borrower suffered financial injury as a result of such practices, the consent orders required remediation to be provided. During the review, customers could be contacted by mortgage servicers for additional information at the direction of the independent consultant.

Requests for review had to be postmarked or submitted online by December 31, 2012.&lt;ref name="OCC1"&gt;{{cite web 
| title=Correcting Foreclosure Practices
| publisher=Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, US Department of the Treasury 
| url=https://independentforeclosurereview.com/|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interim report===
On June 21, 2012, the OCC released its second interim report on the status of the Independent Foreclosure Review and actions required by consent orders issued in April 2011 to correct deficient mortgage servicing and foreclosure processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Second Interim Report on the Status of the Independent Foreclosure Review|url=http://securitizationauditservices.com/occ-releases-status-report-on-actions-to-correct-deficient-foreclosure-processes-2/|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agencies publish financial remediation framework===
On June 21, 2012, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System released a financial remediation framework [http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20120621a.htm] that provided examples of errors in foreclosures covered by the regulators' consent orders that require compensation or other remediation as directed in the regulators' April 2011 orders.  The consultants use the framework to recommend remediation for financial injury identified during the Independent Foreclosure Review.  The servicers prepare remediation plans based on the consultants' recommendations.  The federal banking regulators had to approve each servicer's remediation plan.  The framework helped ensure that similarly-situated borrowers receive similar treatment.

==Eligibility for review==
To be eligible, the mortgage must have been active in the foreclosure process between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2010, the property securing the loan must have been the primary residence, and the mortgage must have been serviced by one of the following mortgage servicers:&lt;ref name="OCC1" /&gt;
* America's Servicing Company
* Aurora Loan Services
* BAC Home Loans Servicing
* [[Bank of America]]
* [[Beneficial Finance]]
* [[Chase (bank)|Chase]]
* [[Citibank]]
* [[Citifinancial|CitiFinancial]]
* CitiMortgage
* [[Countrywide]]
* EMC Mortgage Corporation
* EverBank/EverHome Mortgage Company
* [[Financial Freedom]]
* [[GMAC Mortgage]]
* [[HSBC Finance|HFC]]
* [[HSBC]]
* IndyMac Mortgage Services
* MetLife Bank
* [[National City Mortgage]]
* [[PNC Mortgage]]
* [[Sovereign Bank]]
* SunTrust Mortgage
* [[U.S. Bank]]
* Wachovia Mortgage
* [[Washington Mutual|Washington Mutual (WaMu)]]
* [[Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.]]
* Wilshire Credit Corporation

Note: Both Litton Loan Servicing (owned by Goldman Sachs) and Saxon Mortgage (owned by Morgan Stanley) also signed consent orders with regulators.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Reserve Press Release, Dated January 16, 2013 http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20130116a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engagement letters==
The OCC also released engagement letters that describe how the independent consultants, retained by the servicers, will conduct their file reviews and claims processes to identify borrowers who suffered financial injury as a result of deficiencies identified in the OCC's consent orders.

== Allegations of impropriety ==
There have been allegations that the banks themselves have a heavy hand in the review process.  News sources, which are citing e-mails,  employee interviews and contracts, suggested that the biggest offenders—Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase—appeared to be conducting much of the review work themselves, compromising  the independence of the review.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/23/evidence-independent-foreclosure-review_n_2005396.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Yves Smith, in her financial blog Naked Capitalism, wrote a thorough analysis of the Independent Foreclosure Review, interviewing several former reviewers on the practices used both by Bank of America, and its review contractor [[Promontory Financial Group]].

Her findings showed, in her words:

1. After extensive debriefing of Bank of America whistleblowers, we found overwhelming evidence that the bank engaged in certain abuses frequently, in some cases pervasively, in its servicing of delinquent mortgages.

2. This settlement, as intended, was yet another significant bailout to predatory servicers.

3. As we will demonstrate in later posts in this series, even making the most generous interpretation possible of the role played by Promontory, Promontory's review at Bank of America completely omitted significant categories of borrower harm that were explicitly discussed both in the OCC consent order and Promontory's engagement letter with Bank of America.

4. The organizational design, the way the reviewers were managed, the elimination of areas of inquiry, and evidence of records tampering with Bank of America records all point to a multifaceted, if not necessarily well orchestrated, program to make sure as much damaging information as possible was not considered or minimized.

'''Joseph Franz Schacht''' (15 March 1902 – 1 August 1969) was a British-German professor of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Islam]] at [[Columbia University]] in New York.  He was the leading Western scholar on [[Sharia|Islamic law]], whose ''Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'' (1950) is still considered a centrally important work on the subject.  The author of many articles in the first and second editions of the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', Schacht also edited the second edition of ''The Legacy of Islam'' for the [[Legacy series|''Legacy'' series]] of Oxford University Press and authored a textbook under the title ''An Introduction to Islamic Law'' (1964).

==Life and career==
{{no footnotes|section|date=September 2016}}
Schacht was born into a Catholic family but, with a zeal for study, became at an early age a student in a Hebrew school. In Breslau and Leipizig he studied Semitic languages, Greek, and Latin, under professors including [[Gotthelf Bergsträsser|Gotthelf Bergsträßer]]. In 1925 he obtained his first academic position at the [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg]] in Breisgau. In 1927 he became there a professor extraordinarius, making him the youngest professor in all of Germany, and in 1929 a professor ordinarius of [[Semitic language]]s. In 1932 he was appointed a professor at the [[University of Königsberg]]. But in 1934, without being directly threatened or persecuted, Schacht, as a strong opponent of the Nazi regime, went to [[Cairo]], where he taught until 1939 as a professor. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, he happened to be in England, where he offered his services to the British government and worked for the [[BBC]]. In 1947 he became a British citizen.

Schacht taught at [[Oxford University]] from 1946. In 1954 he moved to the [[Netherlands]] and taught at the [[University of Leiden]]. In the academic year 1957–1958, he taught at [[Columbia University]], where, in 1959 he became a full professor of Arabic and [[Islamic studies]]. He remained at Columbia until his retirement in 1969 as professor emeritus.

One of Schacht's major contributions to the history of early Islam is the recognition that [[Hadith]] probably stems from those in whom the different traditions of the past converge, and this convergence Schacht describes as "common link". This concept was later used productively by many other [[Oriental studies|orientalists]].&lt;ref&gt;Wakin, Jeanette: [http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/ilsp/publications/wakin.pdf ''Remembering Joseph Schacht (1902–1969)''].

==Thought==
===Theory of Islamic law===
Schacht argued that Islamic law was not as classical Islamic jurisprudence taught,  
*the product of an ordered following of four sources/components (in the following order) — 
##the [[Quran]], 
##the [[Sunnah]] (the body of traditional social and legal custom and practice of the Islamic community), 
##''[[Qiyas]]'' (the process of deductive analogy ), and 
##''[[Ijma]]'' (the consensus/agreement of Muslim scholars) ; 
*neither did its chronology  follow a direct path of [[Allah]]-&gt; [[Muhammad]]-&gt; [[Sahabah|Companions]]-&gt; [[Tabi‘un|Followers]]-&gt; [[Fiqh]],&lt;ref name="Maghen-2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maghen|first1=Ze'ev|title=Dead Tradition: Joseph Schacht and the Origins of "Popular Practice"|journal=Islamic Law and Society|date=2003|volume=10|issue=3|pages=276–347|jstor=3399422}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*nor was fiqh development centered shortly after Muhammad's death in the city ([[Medina]]) where he had established his state and where memory and traditions of him were the strongest. 
Rather the law arose from historical development of three different "sunnas" — bodies of custom, rules and law — operating in parallel during the period of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. 
#The "pre-Islamic sunna of Arabia, 
#the mixed custom-administrative law sunna of the distant provinces" of the Umayyads, and later 
#the "living traditions" of the newly formed Islamic schools. 
Unification of Islamic legal thought (so that only one sunna remained) occurred under the legal scholar [[Al-Shafi‘i]] (767-820), when the ahadith of Muhammad became pre-eminent (except for the Quran).  The most important of the schools of Islamic law developed in [[Kufa]] in [[Mesopotamia]], according to Schacht's research, and its legal precepts spread to other cities such as Medina."&lt;ref&gt;J. SCHACHT, ''The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'' (1950), supra note 5, at 228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. SCHACHT, ''An Introduction to Islamic Law'' (1964), supra note 5, at 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forte-1978-9-11"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Islamic Law; the impact of Joseph Schacht |journal=Loyola Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review |date=1978|volume=1|page=11 |url=http://www.soerenkern.com/pdfs/islam/IslamicLawTheImpactofJosephSchacht.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning around 100 A.H. (720 CE), ahadith of Muhammad "began to be fabricated", forming the Islamic Sunnah as it is known today. While scholars recognized that many ahadith were false and attempted to weed these out with [[Hadith studies|ʻilm al-ḥadīth]], this was in vane as most if not all are inauthentic.  According to Schacht, with the exception of "a few modifications dictated by the Qur'an", the Islamic "Sunna" is the same as the "sunna" of "pre-Mohammed Arabia".&lt;ref name="Forte-1978-9-10"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Islamic Law; the impact of Joseph Schacht |journal=Loyola Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review |date=1978|volume=1|pages=9–10 |url=http://www.soerenkern.com/pdfs/islam/IslamicLawTheImpactofJosephSchacht.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One  example of the power of traditional law was that under the caliphate, theft was punished by flogging, even though the Qur'an had prescribed maiming/amputation.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schacht, ''An Introduction to Islamic Law'' (1964),  supra note 5, at 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schacht argues that in part the fabrication of ahadith came from "a literary convention, which found particular favor in Iraq", whereby authors/scholars would put their "own doctrine or work under the aegis of an ancient authority."&lt;ref name="Forte-1978-12"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Islamic Law; the impact of Joseph Schacht |journal=Loyola Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review |date=1978|volume=1|page=12 |url=http://www.soerenkern.com/pdfs/islam/IslamicLawTheImpactofJosephSchacht.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Pre-Islamic Background and the Early Development of Jurisprudence", in 1 ''Law in the Middle East'' 28 (M. Khadduri &amp; H. Liebesny eds. 1955), supra note 5, at 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate prestigious "ancient authority" in this context was Muhammad and "around 120 A.H." scholars in Kufa, "followed in a few years by the Medinese" began falsely ascribing "their new doctrines back to earlier jurists", and over time extended them back to Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Forte-1978-12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Pre-Islamic Background and the Early Development of Jurisprudence", in 1 ''Law in the Middle East'' 28 (M. Khadduri &amp; H. Liebesny eds. 1955), supra note 5, at 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Schacht also blames the religious fervor of those who "detested" use of ''Qiyas'' and ''Ijma''. Providing suspicious justification for the "Traditionist" fabricators were ahadith such as, "sayings attributed to me which agree with the Qur'an go back to me, whether I actually said them or not."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Schacht, "Pre-Islamic Background and the Early Development of Jurisprudence", in 1 ''Law in the Middle East'' 28 (M. Khadduri &amp; H. Liebesny eds. 1955), supra note 5, at 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Though false, the forgeries could also be justified as recognizing the "final legitimacy of what the prophet Muhammad did and said.&lt;ref&gt;J. SCHACHT, ''An Introduction to Islamic Law'' (1964), supra note 5, at 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence of late creation===
As evidence that most ahadith were created after 100 A.H., Schacht notes that: 
#all authentic early writings of Islamic law are virtually devoid of any mention of ahadith of Muhammad;&lt;ref&gt;J. SCHACHT, ''The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'' (1950), supra note 5, at 141.&lt;/ref&gt;
#the early doctrines of the schools of law were "almost always traced" to an earlier jurist or to the ''[[Sahabah]]'' ("companions" of Muhammad) but "virtually never" to Muhammad;&lt;ref&gt;J. SCHACHT, ''An Introduction to Islamic Law'' (1964),  supra note 5, at 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. SCHACHT, ''The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'' (1950),  supra note 5, at 21, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
#but "the best way of proving that a tradition did not exist at a certain time" according to Schacht, was "to show that it is not used as a legal argument in a discussion which would have made reference to it imperative, if it had existed."&lt;ref&gt;J. SCHACHT, ''The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'' (1950),  supra note 5, at 140.&lt;/ref&gt;  In reply to the argument that jurists, etc. may not have used a legal argument in a discussion because they had not known about it, Schacht states:
::a. communications in the Islamic empire at that time were good enough for "doctrines and views" to "spread easily and quickly from one juristic center to another";
::b. if the behavior and utterances of Muhammad were the basis of Islamic law from the beginning of Islamic society, it is unlikely those involved in matters of law — "among the most learned and pious men of Islam" — would not know them;
::c. there were not dozens but "hundreds of examples in which the disparity between an early decision and a later tradition took place". According to David F. Forte, "it goes beyond rational belief to think that these men would have been so consistently ignorant of contrary actions by the Prophet."&lt;ref name="Forte-1978-14"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forte |first1=David F.|title=Islamic Law; the impact of Joseph Schacht |journal=Loyola Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review |date=1978|volume=1|page=14 |url=http://www.soerenkern.com/pdfs/islam/IslamicLawTheImpactofJosephSchacht.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
===Debate===
Some have argued against Schacht that while the ahadith are fabricated as Schacht claims, the substance of the rules of law that the ahadith were invented to support were promulgated by the Prophet while at Medina."

===''The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'' (book)===

As a whole, ''Origins'' critiques the methods and standards of ḥadīth verification as they were first articulated by [[Al-Shafi‘i]] and subsequently developed by his students in the eighth and ninth centuries CE, an early and centrally important stage in the formation of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]]. His research builds upon the work of important figures in the nineteenth- and twentieth-century study of Islamic law in Europe, such as [[Gustav Weil]] and [[Ignác Goldziher]]. In particular, Schacht advocates a skeptical approach to medieval forms of 'isnād criticism, which he views as fabricated and comprising the greater part of [[Sunni]] approaches to verifying Prophetic traditions of a legal nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacht|first=Joseph|title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence|year=1967|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Argument and Method ====

Schacht locates the origins of '''ilm al-ḥadīth'' in the eight and ninth centuries CE, a moment in the development of Islamic legal reasoning coinciding with the professionalization of the traditionalist (''muḥaddith'') and jurist (''[[faqīh]]'') classes in the urban centers of the [[Middle East]].

Schacht credits Imām [[Al-Shafi‘i|al-Shāfiʻī]], the founder of an [[Shafi'i|eponymous school of Islamic jurisprudence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacht|first=Joseph|title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence|year=1967|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with "creating" "the essentials" of the theory of [[fiqh]] (the system of Islamic jurisprudence), made up of four principles/sources/components mentioned above: the [[Qurʾān]], the ḥadīth of the [[Muhammad|Prophet Muḥammad]] and his [[Sahabah|Companions]], scholarly consensus ([[Ijma|ijmāʿ]]), analogical reasoning ([[Qiyas|qiyās]]).&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-1&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |origyear= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snouck Hurgronje, C. ''Verspreide Geschriften. v.ii. 1923-7, page 286-315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Étude sur la théorie du droit musulman'' (Paris : Marchal et Billard, 1892-1898.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margoliouth, D.S., ''The Early Development of Mohammedanism'', 1914, page 65ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schacht, Joseph in ''Encyclopedia of Islam'', 1913 v.IV, sv ''Usul''&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Quran has relatively few verses pertaining to fiqh, Al-Shafi‘i's system meant that "the great bulk" of the rules of the Islamic law were derived from ahadith.&lt;ref name="Forte-1978-2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Forte|first1=David F. |title=Islamic Law; the impact of Joseph Schacht |journal=Loyola of Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review |date=1978|volume=1|page=2 |url=http://www.soerenkern.com/pdfs/islam/IslamicLawTheImpactofJosephSchacht.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
Schacht states that Shafi'i repeatedly insisted that "nothing" could override the authority of the Prophet, even if it was "attested only by an isolated tradition", and that if a hadith was "well-authenticated" (''[[Hadith terminology#Ṣaḥīḥ|Ṣaḥīḥ]]'') going back to the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, it had "precedence over the opinions of his [[Sahabah|Companions]], their successors, and later authorities".&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-11&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |origyear= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=11  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the work of Goldziher before him, Schacht argues that it was al-Shāfiʻī who first elevated the sunna and its constituent traditions to great legal prominence. The material importance of the Qurʾān and ḥadīth thereafter enjoyed a status comparable to that of juristic consensus, though for al-Shāfiʻī traditions credibly attributed to the Prophet were to be considered more authoritative than those of his Companions, and indeed could supersede all other sources of legal authority. Moreover, an already-existing legal standard based on such a tradition could be overturned only upon the emergence of a ḥadīth that could be more credibly attributable to the Prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacht|first=Joseph|title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence|year=1967|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=2–5; 11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Shāfiʻī|title=Treatise III, Ikhtilāf Mālik wal-Shāfiʻī|pages=177–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Al-Shāfiʻī goes as far as to claim that such well-established traditions invite no debate as to their validity; their truth simply imposes itself upon the human mind, leaving no room for doubt or speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacht|first=Joseph|title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence.|year=1967|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Shāfiʻī|title=Ikhtilāf al-ḥadīth|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Schacht points out, however, that al-Shāfiʻī  inconsistently applies this rule in his own work, alleging that in some cases the jurist favored 'aḥādīth transmitted from Companions that openly contradicted those attributable to the Prophet. These traditions usually included those which validated ritual practices that were either universally agreed upon or else independently verifiable (such as [[salat|daily prayer]]), and those which disputed the legal positions of al-Shāfiʻī's opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacht|first=Joseph|title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence.|year=1967|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=14–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Shāfiʻī|title=Ikhtilāf al-ḥadīth|page=57 &amp; 88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on this lattermost point, Schacht contends that far from constructing the standards of a legitimate epistemic enterprise al-Shāfiʻī's science of ḥadīth amounts to little more than an uncritical acceptance of Prophetic traditions which justified his own legal preferences. These same traditions, claims Schacht, could not survive a stronger program of investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacht|first=Joseph|title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence.|year=1967|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the technical evaluation of traditions would continue to evolve across many generations of Muslim scholars, it seems to have largely proceeded along the lines of the deficient form of ’isnād criticism first articulated here by al-Shāfiʻī.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacht|first=Joseph|title=An Introduction to Islamic Law|year=1966|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=35–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in Origins Schacht presents evidence which in his estimation suggests that there was in fact a large scale fabrication of Prophetic ’isnāds in the generation preceding the life of al-Shāfiʻī's own teacher, [[Malik ibn Anas|Mālik ibn ’Anas]] (d. 795 CE). Even in Mālik's esteemed golden narrative chain there are suspicious gaps and obvious substitutions, sowing significant doubts as to credibility of the relationships he was said to have had with certain key transmitters. For these reasons modern scholars cannot be nearly as optimistic about the historical-analytic value of ḥadīth literature as were their medieval Muslim counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Schacht 163-4. compares the unique matn of al-Muw. i.371 with the same in al-Bukhārī, who has Abū Hurayra relate the tradition and not ‘Urwa. At 165-6 Schacht compares al-Shāf‘ī Tr. II with Muw. Al-Shay. 166 and Muw. ii.II.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reception====

Schacht's views on this matter have come under criticism from scholars in recent decades. His notable critics include [[Muhammad Mustafa Al-A'zami|M. Muṣṭafā al-Aʻẓamī]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Aʻẓamī|first=M. Muṣṭafā|title=On Schacht's Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence|year=1985|publisher=King Saud University|location=Riyadh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Wael Hallaq]]. Al-A'zami's work ''On Schacht's Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'' is a systematic response to Schacht's thesis. Hallaq argues that Schacht mistakenly assumes that medieval Muslims scholars held ḥadīth to be [[Apodicticity|apodictically true]]. According to Hallaq, it is more likely the case — and indeed apparent to the careful reader upon inspecting the literature — that at least where matters of law were concerned medieval Muslim scholars judged the majority of ḥadīth as only probabilistically true. It was the epistemic sum of probable traditions, and not the assured truth of any one tradition in particular, upon which they built their legal rulings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hallaq|first=Wael B.|title=The Authenticity of Prophetic Ḥadîth: A Pseudo-Problem|journal=Studia Islamica|year=1999|volume=No. 89|pages=77–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Scholarly reaction to Schacht's work has produced "three camps of scholars" according to Mohsen Haredy citing  [[Wael Hallaq]]. Those (such as [[John Wansbrough]], and [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]]) who seek to "reconfirm his conclusions", and at times going beyond them; those who endeavor to refute them (Nabia Abbott, F. Sezgin, M. Azami, Gregor Schoeler and Johann Fück) and a those "seeking to create a middle, perhaps synthesized, position between the two" (Motzki, D. Santillana, G.H. Juynboll, Fazlur Rahman and James Robson).&lt;ref&gt;Wael B. Hallaq, “[https://archive.org/stream/TheAuthenticityOfPropheticHadithAPseudoProblemWaelB.Hallaq/The%20Authenticity%20of%20Prophetic%20Hadith%20A%20Pseudo-Problem%20(Wael%20B.%20Hallaq)_djvu.txt The Authenticity of Prophetic Hadith: A Pseudo-problem]”, in ''Studia Islamica'', 89 (1999), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haredy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haredy|first1=Mohsen|title=Hadith Textual Criticism: A Reconsideration *|url=https://archive.islamonline.net/?p=5986|website=Islam Online Archive|accessdate=4 May 2018|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Forte, "nearly all Western Islamic scholars agree that Schacht's evidence against the authenticity of the traditions is virtually unassailable."&lt;ref name="Forte-1978-15"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Islamic Law; the impact of Joseph Schacht |journal=Loyola Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review |date=1978|volume=1|page=15 |url=http://www.soerenkern.com/pdfs/islam/IslamicLawTheImpactofJosephSchacht.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the supporters of his these include Maurice Gaudefroy-Demombynes, who rights that many ahadith, "are apocryphal and were invented in the 8th century in order to justify innovations and tendencies which were very foreign to the intentions of the Prophet."&lt;ref&gt;M. Gaudefroy-Demombynes, Muslim Institutions 62 (1950), supra note 40, at 65.&lt;/ref&gt; J. N. D. Anderson, who states most ahadith were, "beyond question, fabricated,"&lt;ref&gt;J. N. D. Anderson, ''Islamic Law in the Modern World'' (1959), supra note 2, at 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert Liebesny&lt;ref&gt;''The Law of the NEAR AND MIDDLE EAST'' 24 (1970), "The Actual Historical Development."&lt;/ref&gt; Seymour Vesey-Fitzgerald, who states "there was deliberate forgery of traditions by responsible lawyers on such a scale that no purely legal tradition of the Prophet himself can be regarded as above suspicion."&lt;ref&gt;Vesey-Fitzgerald, "Nature and Sources of the Shari'a", in 1 ''Law In The Middle East'' 85-94 (M. Khadduri and H. Liebesny eds. 1955).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2752">In [[England and Wales]], the '''Legal Services Ombudsman''' was a [[statute|statutory]] officer that investigated allegations about the improper, ineffective or inefficient way that complaints about [[lawyer]]s are handled by their respective self-regulating professional bodies. The '''Ombudsman''' is appointed by, and is answerable to, the [[Lord Chancellor]] and [[Secretary of State for Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Courts and Legal Services Act 1990]], ss.21-26/ Sch.3&lt;/ref&gt; It has been abolished under the [[Legal Services Act 2007]]

The first '''Ombudsman''' was appointed to start work on 2 January 1991.  During the first decade of operation, the office undertook 10,531 investigations:
*9,456 complaints about [[solicitor]]s;
*1,036 complaints about [[barrister]]s; and
*39 complaints about [[licensed conveyancer]]s.

Around 60% of the firms of solicitors in England and Wales and around 8% of practising barristers were subject of a complaint to the '''Ombudsman''' in that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Annual Report 2000-2001: Reflecting Progress | url=http://www.olso.org/publications/AnnualReports/files/AR2001-english.pdf | publisher=Legal Services Ombudsman | year=2001 | accessdate=2008-03-08 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704122530/http://www.olso.org/publications/AnnualReports/files/AR2001-english.pdf | archivedate=2007-07-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;



==Powers==
The '''Ombudsman''' could:&lt;ref&gt;[[Courts and Legal Services Act 1990]], s.23&lt;/ref&gt;
*Recommend that the professional body re-investigate a complaint;
*Order the re-investigation;
*Formally criticise the professional body;
*Award compensation for distress or inconvenience.
 
There was also a power to re-investigate the original complaint but this is only used in exceptional circumstances.

==Reform==
With the passing of The [[Legal Services Act 2007]] the Office of the Legal Services Ombudsman was abolished. It has been replaced by the [[Office for Legal Complaints]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Legal Services Act 2007]], ss.114-159/ Sch.15&lt;/ref&gt; This body goes by the public name [[Legal Ombudsman]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="65107">[[File:Royal Courts of Justice 20130414 065.JPG|thumb|The [[Royal Courts of Justice]], [[London]]. The doctrine of legitimate expectation was predominantly developed by the [[courts of the United Kingdom|UK courts]].]]
{{Administrative law}}

The doctrine of '''legitimate expectation''' was first developed in [[English law]] as a ground of [[judicial review]] in [[administrative law]] to protect a procedural or substantive interest when a public authority rescinds from a representation made to a person. It is based on the principles of [[natural justice]] and fairness, and seeks to prevent authorities from [[abuse of power|abusing power]].

The [[courts of the United Kingdom]] have recognized both procedural and substantive legitimate expectations. A procedural legitimate expectation rests on the presumption that a public authority will follow a certain procedure in advance of a decision being taken, while a substantive legitimate expectation arises where an authority makes a lawful representation that an individual will receive or continue to receive some kind of substantive benefit. In determining a claim for an alleged breach of a legitimate expectation, a court will deliberate over three key considerations: (1) whether a legitimate expectation has arisen; (2) whether it would be unlawful for the authority to frustrate such an expectation; and (3) if it is found that the authority has done so, what remedies are available to the aggrieved person.

Procedural legitimate expectations have been recognized in a number of [[common law]] jurisdictions. In contrast, notwithstanding their acceptance and protection in the UK, substantive legitimate expectations have not been universally recognized. For instance, they have been given effect in [[legitimate expectation in Singapore law|Singapore]] but not in Australia.

==Introduction==

===Origins and basis of the doctrine===
[[File:Justice (3643291515).jpg|thumb|upright|[[F. W. Pomeroy]]'s 1906 statue of [[Lady Justice]] on the dome of the [[Old Bailey]] in London. The doctrine of legitimate expectation is viewed as an offshoot of [[natural justice]].]]

Since its inception, the doctrine of legitimate expectation has been viewed as an offshoot of [[natural justice]].&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Schmidt v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1968|num=1|parallelcite=[1969] 2 Ch. 149 at 170–171|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The duty to act fairly is a core tenet of [[administrative law]] and a predominant feature in the application of the rules of natural justice. With each individual's entitlement to natural justice and fairness, legitimate expectation reinforces the duty of public bodies to act fairly. It is this protection of fairness that made way for the courts' acknowledgement of legitimate expectations. In their elaboration of the doctrine, [[courts of the United Kingdom]] adopted other key aspects of judicial review such as [[Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp|''Wednesbury'' unreasonableness]], fairness,&lt;ref name="MFK 1569"&gt;''R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte M.F.K. Underwriting Agents Ltd.'' (1989) [1990] 1 W.L.R. 1545 at 1569–1570, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ([[High Court of Justice#Queen's Bench Division|Queen's Bench]]) (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[abuse of power]]&lt;ref name="Bancoult"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. (Bancoult) v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|link=R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex p Bancoult (No 2)|court=UKHL|year=2008|num=61|parallelcite=[2009] A.C. 453 at 513, para. 135|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to justify the existence and the protection of legitimate expectations.

The term ''legitimate expectation'' was first used in the case of ''Schmidt v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs'' (1968),&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt; but was not applied on the facts. Subsequently, in ''O'Reilly v. Mackman'' (1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=O'Reilly v. Mackman|court=UKHL|year=1983|num=1|parallelcite=[1983] 2 A.C. 237|courtname=H.L.|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the doctrine of legitimate expectation was recognized as part of [[judicial review#Judicial review of administrative acts|judicial review]] in [[public law]], allowing individuals to challenge the legality of decisions on the grounds that the decision-maker "had acted outwith the powers conferred upon it".&lt;ref&gt;''O'Reilly'', p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially unclear, the nature and boundaries of the doctrine of legitimate expectation have been elucidated by seminal cases such as ''[[Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service|Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service]]'' (the ''GCHQ'' case, 1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service|link=Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service|court=UKHL|year=1983|num=6|parallelcite=[1985] A.C. 374|courtname=H.L.|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan]]'' (1999).&lt;ref name="Coughlan"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan|link=R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1999|num=1871|parallelcite=[2001] Q.B. 213|courtname=C.A.|juris=England &amp; Wales}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding efforts of the courts, some ambiguity as to when legitimate expectations arise persisted. In response, [[Lord Justice of Appeal]] [[John Laws (judge)|John Laws]] proposed the aspiration of "good administration" as a justification for the protection of legitimate expectations.&lt;ref name="Nadarajah"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Nadarajah v. Secretary of State for the Home Department|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=2005|num=1363|para=68|courtname=C.A.|juris=England &amp; Wales}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal framework===
A procedural legitimate expectation is created when a representation is made by a public authority that it will follow a certain procedure before making a decision on the substantive merits of a particular case. Examples of procedural legitimate expectations include an expectation to be consulted&lt;ref name="Ng Yuen Shiu"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Attorney-General for Hong Kong v. Ng Yuen Shiu|court=UKPC|year=1983|num=2|parallelcite=[1983] 2 A.C. 629|courtname=auto|juris=Hong Kong}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and to a fair hearing.&lt;ref name="UDL Marine"&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=UDL Marine (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. v. Jurong Town Corp.|court=SGHC|year=2011|num=45|parallelcite=[2011] 3 S.L.R. [''Singapore Law Reports''] 94 at 115, paras. 65–66|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A substantive legitimate expectation is formed where a representation is made by an authority as to the final decision and outcome that the authority will make in a particular case.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Christopher [F.] Forsyth|title=Legitimate Expectations Revisited|journal=Judicial Review|date=December 2011|volume=16|issue=4|pages=429–439 at 436–437, para. 26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon reviewing a claim for the protection of a legitimate expectation against a public authority's decision, courts will deliberate over three key considerations:&lt;ref name="Bibi"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. (Bibi) v. Newham London Borough Council|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=2001|num=607|parallelcite=[2002] 1 W.L.R. 237 at 244–245, para. 24|courtname=C.A.|juris=England &amp; Wales}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The situations and circumstances in which legitimate expectations arise.
*Instances in which it would be unlawful for the public authority to frustrate such an expectation.
*The remedies that would be available to the aggrieved party if it is found that the public authority had unlawfully frustrated a legitimate expectation.

==When does an expectation become legitimate?==
When determining if a legitimate expectation is present, the required conditions are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Lord Woolf|authorlink=Harry Woolf, Baron Woolf|author2=Jeffrey [L.] Jowell|author3=Andrew [P.] Le Sueur|author4=Catherine M[ary] Donnelly|title=De Smith's Judicial Review|edition=6th|location=London|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]]|year=2007|at=para. 4-051|isbn=978-1-84703-467-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The conditions were adopted by the [[High Court of Singapore]] in {{cite CommonLII|litigants=Borissik v. Urban Redevelopment Authority|court=SGHC|year=2009|num=154|parallelcite=[2009] 4 S.L.R.(R.)  [''Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)''] 92 at 105, para. 49|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The representation must be clear, unambiguous, and not have any relevant qualification.
*The expectation must be induced by the behaviour of the public authority.
*The representation must have been made by someone who had [[law of agency#Actual authority|actual]] or [[apparent authority]].
*The representation must be applicable to the aggrieved parties.

Courts take into account not only the reasonableness of the expectation but other considerations such as the nature of representation made. In the ''GCHQ'' case, [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Lord Diplock]] stated that a legitimate expectation is one which "has consequences to which effect will be given in public law, whereas an expectation or hope that some benefit or advantage would continue to be enjoyed, although it might well be entertained by a 'reasonable' man, would not necessarily have such consequences".&lt;ref&gt;''GCHQ'' case, pp. 408–409.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[question of law]], and has to be decided on an objective basis with full reference to the facts of the case.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Findlay'' [1985] A.C. 318, H.L. (UK).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''GCHQ'' case states that "effect will be given in public law" for a legitimate expectation, the legitimacy of an expectation is not meant to be a conclusory label assuring the court's provision of remedies, but rather to warrant ''[[prima facie]]'' protection only. It may be rebutted by countervailing public interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Iain Steele|title=Substantive Legitimate Expectations: Striking the Right Balance?|journal=[[Law Quarterly Review]]|date=April 2005|volume=121|pages=300–328 at 304–305}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature of representation made===
A legitimate expectation does not arise when it is made ''[[ultra vires]]'' of the decision-maker's statutory powers, that is, when the decision-maker lacked legal power to make the representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Rowland v. Environment Agency|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=2003|num=1885|paralllelcite=[2005] Ch. 1 at 39, para. 102|courtname=C.A.|juris=England &amp; Wales}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Courts are reluctant to protect such an expectation that has been created. The rationale is undoubtedly clear and rests on the scope of the administrative authority's powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Paul [P.] Craig|authorlink=Paul Craig (law professor)|title=Administrative Law|edition=5th|location=London|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]]|year=2004|pages=671–672|isbn=978-0-421-79920-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It prevents public authorities from expanding their powers simply by making ''ultra vires'' representations. Secondly, allowing public authorities to be bound by their ''ultra vires'' representations may potentially prevent them from exercising their statutory powers or duties. Also, allowing a public authority to be bound could be unfair to third parties who are affected. However, courts may be obliged to protect legitimate expectations arising from representations by unauthorized officers of the public body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=South Bucks District Council v. Flanagan|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=2002|num=690|parallelcite=[2002] W.L.R. 2601 at 2607, para. 18|courtname=C.A.|juris=England &amp; Wales}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Ultra vires'' representations====
Expectations are not legitimate when they require a public authority to act in breach of its statutory duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Director of Public Prosecutions, ex parte Kebilene|court=UKHL|year=1999|num=43|parallelcite=[2000] 2 A.C. 326 at 368|courtname=H.L.|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This applies only when the statutory provisions diametrically conflict with the representation. In other words, the statutory provision will render the courts' fulfilment of the expectation impossible. However, a statutory provision which merely permits, but does not compel the public authority to breach the expectation will not necessarily justify any such breach.
 
An individual's [[human rights]] protected by the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] of the UK,&lt;ref name="c. 42"&gt;[[Human Rights Act 1998]] ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents c. 42], UK).&lt;/ref&gt; may occasionally override arguments of legality. In ''Stretch v. United Kingdom'' (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Stretch v. United Kingdom|court=ECHR|year=2003|num=320|parallelcite=(2004) 38 E.H.R.R. 12|courtname=auto}}; see also ''Pine Valley Developments Ltd. v. Ireland'' (1991) 14 E.H.R.R. 319, E.C.H.R.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Court of Human Rights]] declared that whether the legality of the authority's action should be ignored will be determined on a case-by-case basis, and in light of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Peter Leyland|author2=Gordon Anthony|chapter=Legitimate Expectations|title=Textbook on Administrative Law|edition=7th|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2013|pages=353–372 at 369, para. 15.5.1|isbn=978-0-19-960166-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Statements by unauthorized officers====
For an expectation to be legitimate, the individual making the representation must have actual or apparent authority to make it on the behalf of the public authority. Such representations would ''prima facie'' bind the public authority.&lt;ref name="Flanagan 18"&gt;''Flanagan'', p. 2607, para. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Although representations made by an individual with apparent authority may have been made outside his or her powers, they are nevertheless legitimate as they fall within the scope of powers of the particular public body.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, p. 665.&lt;/ref&gt;

Representations will not lead to legitimate expectations when delegation of such power to the individual making the representation is forbidden by statute,&lt;ref&gt;Craig, p. 668.&lt;/ref&gt; or where the individual making the representation lacks actual or apparent authority. In the latter case, the applicant's expectation will lack legitimacy and thus would ''prima facie'' not be binding on the public authority.&lt;ref name="Flanagan 18"/&gt;

===Reasonableness of the expectation===
In deciding whether the expectation held by the aggrieved party is legitimate, the courts will consider whether the expectation was, in all circumstances, reasonable when it was formed.&lt;ref&gt;''Ng Yuen Shiu'', p. 636.&lt;/ref&gt; The reasonableness test requires the court to assess the behaviour of the parties in the events which occurred prior to the making of the alleged representation, according to the following criteria:

*The representation may arise from either the words used or the behaviour of the parties.
*The aggrieved party must not have utilized fraudulent measures to obtain the representation, and must have disclosed all relevant information.&lt;ref name="MFK 1569"/&gt;
*The representation must usually be "clear, unambiguous and devoid of all relevant qualification".&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte M.F.K. Underwriting Agents'', p. 1549.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not required to establish the existence of a legitimate expectation if the public authority acted so unfairly such that its conduct constituted an abuse of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. (on the application of the Association of British Civilian Internees: Far East Region) v. Secretary of State for Defence|court=EWCA|year=2003|num=473|parallelcite=[2003] Q.B. 1397 at 1423, para. 72|courtname=C.A.|juris=England &amp; Wales}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of individuals affected may play a part, as courts have found a legitimate expectation to exist when the representation was "pressing and focused" and made to a small group of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;''Nadarajah'', p. 1386, para. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, courts rarely find the existence of a legitimate expectation when the representation was one made in general terms to a large and diverse group of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Coughlan'', pp. 246–247, para. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may be noted that there are instances where an individual has successfully sought relief on behalf of a sizeable group of people.&lt;ref name="Bancoult"/&gt;

===Reliance and detriment as consideration for legitimacy===
[[File:HM King George the Fifth Gateway, The Leys School, Cambridge, England - IMG 0711.JPG|thumb|The [[George V|H.M. King George the Fifth]] Gateway of [[The Leys School]] in [[Cambridge]], UK. In a 1999 case, ''ex parte Begbie'', a schoolgirl admitted to the school under a state-funded assisted places scheme claimed her legitimate expectation had been breached after the scheme was cancelled. In its judgment, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] noted it is unnecessary for applicants to show they have relied on public bodies' representations to their detriment to establish legitimate expectations. However, where detrimental reliance is absent, courts will only protect a legitimate expectation in exceptional cases.]]

Courts have considered the applicant's reliance on the representation as a relevant consideration when determining the existence of a legitimate expectation. The role of reliance may be better assessed by distinguishing between "weak reliance" and "strong reliance". Weak reliance occurs when the applicant was made aware of and merely believed in the truth of the representation. Strong reliance, on the other hand, occurs where the applicant acted upon the representation and consequently faced detriment.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, pp. 309–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weak reliance is not required where the authority failed to apply the general policy at the time to the individual case at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R v. Secretary of State for Education and Employment, ex parte Walker|court=UKHL|year=2000|num=22|parallelcite=[2000] 1 W.L.R. 806|courtname=H.L.|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This exception is prompted by the overriding imperative of equality. Thus, the applicant need not have had detailed knowledge or the existence of the policy in order for a legitimate expectation to arise where the public authority had departed from the existing policy in deciding the individual case.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Rabinder Singh|authorlink=Rabinder Singh (judge)|author2=Karen Steyn|title=Legitimate Expectation in 1996: Where Now?|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/hart/judrev/1996/00000001/00000001/art00007|journal=Judicial Review|date=March 1996|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong reliance by the applicant is not compulsory to prove the existence of a legitimate expectation. In spite of this, Lord Justice of Appeal [[Peter Gibson]] stated in ''R. v. Secretary of State for Education and Employment, ex parte Begbie'' (1999)&lt;ref name="Begbie"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Secretary of State for Education and Employment, ex parte Begbie|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1999|num=2100|parallelcite=[2000] 1 W.L.R. 1115|courtname=C.A.|juris=England &amp; Wales}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that "it would be wrong to understate the significance of reliance in this area of the law". Detrimental reliance is not indicative of whether the court should protect an applicant's legitimate expectation but usually furthers an applicant's case, and it is only in exceptional cases where courts will protect a legitimate expectation in which detrimental reliance is absent.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Begbie'', pp. 1123–1124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedural legitimate expectations==
A procedural legitimate expectation by an individual or group rests on the presumption that the decision-maker will follow a certain procedure in advance of a decision being taken. This expectation can manifest in various ways, such as the expectation of being consulted;&lt;ref name="GCHQ 401"&gt;''GCHQ'' case, p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; of an inquiry being held;&lt;ref name="Liverpool Taxi Fleet"&gt;''R. v. Liverpool Corporation, ex parte Liverpool Taxi Fleet Operators' Association'' [1972] 2 Q.B. 299, C.A. (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[audi alteram partem|fair hearing]];&lt;ref name="Ng Yuen Shiu"/&gt; and of being allowed time to make representations, especially where the applicant is seeking to persuade an authority to depart from a lawfully established policy.&lt;ref name="GCHQ 415"&gt;''GCHQ'' case, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; The courts' protection of procedural legitimate expectations reinforces the notion that administrative decision-makers should be bound by certain representations which they make to individuals who stand to be affected by their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooted in the principle of natural justice, procedural legitimate expectation protects procedural interests of the individual in public law. Although procedural expectations by applicants may manifest in various forms, they are all aspects of the "right to a hearing",&lt;ref name="GCHQ 415"/&gt; which an individual affected by a decision enjoys.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte Richmond-upon-Thames London Borough Council'' [1994] 1 W.L.R. 74 at 93, C.A. (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; The UK courts developed this doctrine largely to ensure that the rules of natural justice are observed, to encourage good administration and prevent abuses by decision-makers.&lt;ref&gt;''O'Reilly'', p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of procedural protection===
A key step in the development of procedural legitimate expectation was the observation of [[Ian Fraser, Baron Fraser of Tullybelton|Lord Fraser of Tullybelton]] in ''Attorney-General of Hong Kong v. Ng Yuen Shiu'' (1983)&lt;ref name= "Ng Yuen Shiu"/&gt; that "when a public authority has promised to follow a certain procedure, it is in the interest of good administration that it should act fairly and should implement its promise, so long as implementation does not interfere with its statutory duty".&lt;ref name="Ng Yuen Shiu 638"&gt;''Ng Yuen Shiu'', p. 638.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HK ImmgrationTower Entrance.JPG|thumb|left|[[Immigration Tower]], Hong Kong. In a 1983 case, ''Attorney-General of Hong Kong v. Ng Yuen Shiu'', the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] held it was a breach of a procedural legitimate expectation for the [[Director of Immigration]] not to fulfil an undertaking to give an illegal immigrant a chance to make representations before deciding to deport him.]]

Despite initial resistance to recognition of this doctrine by the courts,&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd v. McMahon'' [1987] 1 A.C. 625, C.A. (England &amp; Wales) and H.L. (UK).&lt;/ref&gt; the landmark ''GCHQ'' case firmly established procedural protection of legitimate expectations.&lt;ref name="GCHQ 415"/&gt; In the case, strikes by civil servants at the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] had destabilized operations and were seen as a threat to national security. The [[Government of the United Kingdom]] took swift action to limit the rights of GCHQ employees to join unions, permitting them only to belong to an approved departmental staff association. The applicant organization challenged this decision by arguing that it should have been consulted because of a long-standing practice of doing so. In his judgment, Lord Fraser regarded the term ''legitimate'' as synonymous to "reasonable" and identified two ways in which a legitimate expectation could arise, namely, "either from an express promise given on behalf of a public authority or from the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to continue."&lt;ref name="GCHQ 401"/&gt;

While the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] ultimately held that the government action was not unlawful for reasons of national security, it agreed that there was a legitimate expectation on the facts due to the well-established practice of consultation between the government and the trade union on important matters affecting the latter. The court was of the opinion that if not for national security interests, the application to protect a procedural legitimate expectation through judicial review would have been granted.&lt;ref name="GCHQ 401"/&gt;

Protection of procedural legitimate expectations has since been firmly entrenched as one of the court's roles in judicial review. The importance of procedural fairness as enunciated in the ''GCHQ'' case is further illustrated by ''Re Police Association for Northern Ireland's Reference'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;''Re Police Association for Northern Ireland's Reference'' [1990] N.I. 258, [[Courts of Northern Ireland#High Court|High Court]] (Q.B.) (Northern Ireland).&lt;/ref&gt; Applying the principles in the ''GCHQ'' case, the [[Courts of Northern Ireland#High Court|High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland]] held that the Police Association had neither been deprived of a legitimate expectation nor treated unfairly. The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] also protected procedural interests by stating that a public authority cannot, without some form of warning, change a long-standing practice that it is aware an individual has acted in the light of and derived a benefit from, in the case of ''R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte Unilever plc'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte Unilever plc'' [1996] S.T.C. 681, C.A. (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shift to protection of the substantive domain===
Although the courts' protection of procedural legitimate expectations assured individuals that decision-making processes were guided by fairness and thus the "greater propensity for fairer decisions",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Siraj Shaik Aziz|author2=Sui Yi Siong|title=Expecting the Right Thing: The Imperative for Recognising Substantive Legitimate Expectations in Singapore|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/singlrev30&amp;div=12|journal=Singapore Law Review|year=2012|volume=30|pages=147–164 at 148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in some circumstances a procedural right alone was insufficient for producing a fair outcome as "procedure and substance are intertwined, with procedural rights reinforcing substantive ones, and vice-versa {{sic}}".&lt;ref&gt;Aziz &amp; Sui, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Schmidt'' case&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt; illustrates that the courts' protection of a procedural right inevitably leads to a substantive outcome. The plaintiffs here challenged a decision to refuse renewal of their residence permits on the grounds that they had not been given a hearing before the decision was reached. This argument was rejected as the original permits had been issued for only a certain time, which had since expired. However, [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]], the [[Master of the Rolls]], said that had the plaintiffs' residence permits been revoked before they expired, they "would have a legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay for the permitted time".&lt;ref&gt;''Schmidt'', p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Appeal in effect envisaged procedural protection of a substantive expectation of being allowed to stay in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=C[hristopher] F. Forsyth|title=''Wednesbury'' Protection of Substantive Legitimate Expectations|journal=[[Public Law (journal)|Public Law]]|year=1997|pages=375–384 at 377}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Substantive legitimate expectations==
A substantive legitimate expectation arises where a public body makes a "lawful representation that an individual will receive, or continue to receive, a substantive benefit of some kind".&lt;ref&gt;Leyland &amp; Anthony, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of substantive protection===
In ''R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Hargreaves'' (1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Hargreaves|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1996|num=1006|parallelcite=[1997] W.L.R. 906|courtname=C.A.|juris=England &amp; Wales}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal of England and Wales initially rejected the argument that the courts could perform a substantive review function beyond that permitted by ''Wednesbury'' unreasonableness.&lt;ref name="Leyland 321"&gt;Leyland &amp; Anthony, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in the earlier case of ''R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Khan'' (1984),&lt;ref name="Khan"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Khan|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1984|num=8|parallelcite=[1984] W.L.R. 1337|courtname=C.A.|juris=England &amp; Wales}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the applicant had argued that the government had unfairly failed to apply the criteria in a government circular that outlined when a family could adopt children living outside the UK. In the Court of Appeal's judgment, Lord Justice of Appeal [[Hubert Parker, Baron Parker of Waddington|Hubert Parker]] surmised that expanding the doctrine of legitimate expectation to protect a substantive element would not necessarily be inconsistent with the principle underlying the doctrine. He stated that "just as [other cases have established that public authorities cannot] resile from an undertaking and change [their] policy without giving a fair hearing so, in principle, the [[Home Secretary|Secretary of State]], if he undertakes to allow in persons if certain conditions are satisfied, should not in my view be entitled to resile from that undertaking without affording interested persons a hearing".&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Khan'', p. 1344.&lt;/ref&gt;

This introduced the idea that in certain cases the courts would consider if policy changes were justified even when the affected parties had already been consulted. Effectively, this proposition grants courts the discretion to ascertain whether the public interest is better served by ordering an authority to perform its undertaking than to frustrate it.&lt;ref name="Liverpool Taxi Fleet"/&gt;

''Ex parte Khan'' is also regarded as the first case in which an individual relied on a general policy, as opposed to a specific representation or a policy drawn for a closed class of persons, as the grounds for the expectation of a benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Brigid Hadfield|title=Judicial Review and the Concept of Legitimate Expectation|journal=Northern Ireland Legal Quarterly|year=1988|volume=39|pages=103–119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the case mooted the idea of a substantive legitimate expectation, the doctrine was more completely developed in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judgment of ''R. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, ex parte Hamble (Off-shore) Fisheries Ltd.'' (1995).&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, ex parte Hamble (Off-shore) Fisheries Ltd.'' [1995] 2 All E.R. 714, H.C. (Q.B.) (England &amp; Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Stephen Sedley]] attempted to widen the Court's protection of legitimate expectations by including "substantive protection of a substantive legitimate expectation".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Mark Elliot|title=The Human Rights Act 1998 and the Standard of Substantive Review|journal=[[Cambridge Law Journal]]|date=July 2001|volume=60|issue=2|pages=301–336|doi=10.1017/S0008197301000137|jstor=4508783}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the proposition that legitimate expectations are limited to procedural grounds by stating: "It is difficult to see why it is any less unfair to frustrate a legitimate expectation that something will or will not be done by the decision-maker than it is to frustrate a legitimate expectation that the applicant will be listened to before the decision-maker decides whether to take a particular step."&lt;ref name="Leyland 321"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Hamble (Off-shore) Fisheries'', p.&amp;nbsp;724.&lt;/ref&gt;

When a court protects an applicant's substantive legitimate expectation, it is effectively mandating the outcome of a public body's decision-making process. One criticism is that this undesirably fetters the body's discretion as it will no longer be able to formulate policy without constraints. Nevertheless, it has been acknowledged that protecting substantive legitimate expectations ensures good administration. Consistency and fairness are reinforced in decision-making processes where the administrative power to alter policy is not used to unduly frustrate legitimate expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Søren [J.] Schønberg|author2=Paul [P.] Craig|title=Substantive Legitimate Expectations after ''Coughlan''|journal=Public Law|date=Winter 2000|pages=684–701 at 686–688}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when a public body acts contrary to what it had induced an individual to expect, it may cause that individual severe hardship, especially if he or she relied on the representation and there is no satisfactory alternative to the substance of the promise. The problem is alleviated if the court orders that the individual's legitimate expectation be given effect.&lt;ref&gt;Schønberg &amp; Craig, pp. 696–697.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Categorical approach===
[[File:Wonford Road, Exeter - geograph.org.uk - 1066073.jpg|thumb|Wonford Road in [[Exeter]], UK. Near this place along the same road is the [[Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust]]'s Mardon Neuro-Rehabilitation Centre. When it was known as Mardon House, its threatened closure led to a 1999 judgment, ''ex parte Coughlan'', in which the Court of Appeal said a disabled resident's legitimate expectation that she would have a "home for life" there had been breached by a health authority then managing the facility.]]

Substantive legitimate expectation was definitively recognized as a ground of judicial review in the UK in ''ex parte Coughlan''.&lt;ref name="Coughlan"/&gt; The case involved a health authority which resiled from its explicit promise to the disabled applicant that a facility at which she was living would be her "home for life".&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Coughlan'', p. 223, para. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Appeal affirmed that the applicant had a legitimate expectation that the authority would keep the facility open, and quashed the authority's decision to close it. The Court stated that there were three categories of legitimate expectations:&lt;ref name="Leyland 322"&gt;Leyland &amp; Anthony, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Category (a): substantive legitimate expectation&amp;nbsp;– change of policy'''. A court may decide that a public authority is only required "to bear in mind its previous policy or other representation, giving it the weight it thinks right, but no more, before deciding whether to change course".&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Coughlan'', p. 241, para. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; In this type of case, which involves a change of policy by the authority,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''Re Findlay'' and ''ex parte Hargreaves''.&lt;/ref&gt; the court can only review the decision on the grounds of ''Wednesbury'' unreasonableness.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Coughlan'', pp. 241–242, para. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it will determine if the decision was rational and whether the authority gave proper weight to the implications of not fulfilling the promise.&lt;ref name="Leyland 322"/&gt; In ''ex parte Begbie''&lt;ref name="Begbie"/&gt; it was clarified that cases fall into this category where a sizeable part of the population is affected and the change of policy involves "what may inelegantly be called the macro-political field".&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Begbie'', p. 1131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leyland 323"&gt;Leyland &amp; Anthony, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Category (b): procedural legitimate expectation&amp;nbsp;– no consultation'''. The court may decide that a promise or practice creates a legitimate expectation of being consulted before a certain decision is taken. In this situation, "it is uncontentious that the court itself will require the opportunity for consultation to be given unless there is an overriding reason to resile from it[&lt;ref name="Ng Yuen Shiu 638"/&gt;]&amp;nbsp;... in which case the court will itself judge the adequacy of the reason advanced for the change of policy, taking into account what fairness requires".&lt;ref name="Coughlan 57"&gt;''Ex parte Coughlan'', p. 242, para. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Category (c): substantive legitimate expectation&amp;nbsp;– promise having the character of a contract'''. If a lawful promise or practice has "induced a legitimate expectation of a ''benefit which is substantive'', not simply procedural", the court will decide "whether to frustrate that expectation is so unfair that to take a new and different course will amount to an abuse of power". When the expectation is established to be legitimate, "the court will have the task of weighing the requirements of fairness against any overriding interest relied upon for the change of policy".&lt;ref name="Coughlan 57"/&gt; Most cases of this type are likely to be "cases where the expectation is confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation the character of a contract".&lt;ref name="Leyland 323"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Coughlan'', p. 242, para. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proportionality approach===
Under the categorical approach advocated by ''ex parte Coughlan'', for a substantive legitimate expectation to be protected it had to fit into either category (a) or (c).&lt;ref&gt;Leyland &amp; Anthony, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; However, classifying substantive legitimate expectations into distinct categories is difficult in cases where there are overlaps, leading Lord Justice Laws to suggest in ''ex parte Begbie'' that the categories mentioned in ''ex parte Coughlan'' are not "hermetically sealed".&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Begbie'', p. 1130.&lt;/ref&gt; In an ''[[obiter dictum]]'' in ''Nadarajah v. Secretary of State for the Home Department'' (2005),&lt;ref name="Nadarajah"/&gt; Lord Justice Laws set out a more structured form of merits-based review.&lt;ref name="Moffet"&gt;{{citation|author=Jonathan Moffet|title=Resiling from Legitimate Expectations|journal=Judicial Review|year=2008|volume=13|issue=4|pages=219–231|doi=10.1080/10854681.2008.11426573}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded the categorical approach in ''ex parte Coughlan'' into a continuum based on proportionality, suggesting that in order for a public body's decision to resile from a legitimate expectation to be lawful, it must be "a proportionate response to a legitimate aim pursued by the public body in the public interest".&lt;ref name="Nadarajah 68"&gt;''Nadarajah'', para. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

By advocating proportionality in the court's approach towards protecting substantive legitimate expectations, Lord Justice Laws effectively paralleled the approach used by the UK courts when considering whether an interference with a right subject to qualifications protected by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] is lawful.&lt;ref name="Moffet"/&gt; Drawing guidance from the Convention, the proportionality test requires (1) that the objective of the action must be sufficiently important to justify limiting a fundamental right; (2) that the action designed to meet the objective must be rationally connected to that objective, and not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations; and (3) the means used to impair the right must be no more than is necessary to accomplish the legitimate objective, and the more severe the deleterious effects of an action, the more important the objective must be if the action is to be justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor=Lord Lester of Herne Hill, Q.C.|editor-link=Anthony Lester, Baron Lester of Herne Hill|editor2=David Pannick|editor2-link=David Pannick, Baron Pannick|title=Human Rights Law and Practice|edition=2nd|location=London|publisher=[[LexisNexis]]|year=2004|at=para. 3.10|isbn=978-0-406-96971-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As the European Convention was given effect in the domestic law of the UK by the [[Human Rights Act 1998]],&lt;ref name="c. 42"/&gt; the proportionality approach resonated with the courts which were familiar in applying the test in cases involving qualified Convention rights across a wide spectrum of factual and policy contexts.&lt;ref name="Moffet"/&gt; For instance, the proportionality approach was applied by Justice [[Stephen Silber]] in ''R. (X) v. Head Teacher and Governors of Y School'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. (X) v Head Teacher and Governors of Y School|court=EWHC|division=Admin|year=2007|num=298|paras=113–129|parallelcite=[2008] 1 All E.R. 249|courtname=H.C. (Q.B.)|juris=England &amp; Wales}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overriding public interest===
Having determined that the applicant's substantive expectation is legitimate, the court then has to determine whether there is any overriding public interest justifying the public authority's decision to resile from its representation, or whether fairness dictates that the representation should be given effect to.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Coughlan'', p. 242, paras. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remedies==

===Fulfilment of the legitimate expectation===
When a court establishes that a public authority's decision has breached a legitimate expectation, it may annul the decision and order that the authority fulfil the expectation. A decision is invalidated by the issuance of a quashing order (also known as ''[[certiorari]]''), one of the more common [[prerogative writ|prerogative orders]], and often results in the issue returning to the original body to be reconsidered afresh.&lt;ref&gt;Leyland &amp; Anthony, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''Ng Yuen Shiu'',&lt;ref name="Ng Yuen Shiu"/&gt; a representation was made by the [[Director of Immigration]] that each illegal entrant to Hong Kong from Macau, of whom the applicant was one, would be interviewed with each case treated on its merits before a decision was made whether to deport the entrant. However, the applicant was not given an opportunity to make any representations. The Director's failure to provide the applicant with this chance was deemed a sufficient ground for quashing the decision. The [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal of Hong Kong]] had ordered a [[writ of prohibition|prohibition]] restraining the removal orders from being executed. However, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]]  decided that a prohibition was excessive and issued a ''certiorari'' instead. It noted that the latter order did not prevent the Director from making a fresh removal order following a fair inquiry at which the applicant had been given an opportunity to explain why he should not be deported.&lt;ref&gt;''Ng Yuen Shiu'', p. 639.&lt;/ref&gt;

A quashing order may also be used to protect a substantive legitimate expectation. It sets aside the decision that frustrates the promise made by a public authority to an applicant, thus binding the authority to fulfil its representation. In ''Ex parte Coughlan'', the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that the applicant had a substantive legitimate expectation for the facility at which she was living to be kept open for the rest of her life, which the health authority was not allowed to frustrate. It therefore upheld the High Court's decision to issue a quashing order to prevent the authority from closing the facility, effectively ensuring that the facility was kept running for the benefit of its residents.&lt;ref name="Coughlan"/&gt;

To direct a public body fulfil a legitimate expectation, the court issues a mandatory order (also known as a ''[[mandamus]]''). This is a prerogative order which commands a public body to perform a public duty, and is often used to compel public bodies to exercise the powers given to them.&lt;ref&gt;Leyland &amp; Anthony, p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconsideration of decision===
In ''R. (Bibi) v. Newham London Borough Council'' (2001),&lt;ref name="Bibi"/&gt; instead of ordering that the public authority fulfil a legitimate expectation that had been breached, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that when the decision in question is "informed by social and political value judgments as to priorities of expenditure" it is more appropriate for the authority to make the decision,&lt;ref&gt;''Bibi'', p. 252, para. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; and the court may order that the authority should merely reconsider its decision, taking into account the person's substantive legitimate expectation.&lt;ref&gt;''Bibi'', p. 252, para. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damages===
The payment of [[damages]] (monetary compensation) by a public authority is relevant to legitimate expectation in two ways. First, if the authority has voluntarily paid damages to an individual for breaching a legitimate expectation, the court could hold that the authority has not abused its power and thus there is no need to compel it to fulfil the expectation.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Coughlan'', p. 251, para. 82; ''Bibi'', p.&amp;nbsp;250, para.&amp;nbsp;56.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, it has been suggested that upon finding that the authority has breached a legitimate expectation, instead of ordering the expectation to be given effect, the court could direct that damages be paid. However, a serious difficulty with this proposal is the fact that at present English law does not generally recognize monetary compensation as a remedy for breaches of public law. A person can only obtain damages if he or she also has a parallel [[cause of action]] in [[private law]] (for example, in the law of [[contract]] or [[tort]]), and the non-fulfilment of a legitimate expectation is only likely to give rise to such a cause of action on rare occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, pp. 322–323.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''R. v. Commissioners of Custom and Excise, ex parte F &amp; I Services Ltd.'' (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Commissioners of Custom and Excise, ex parte F &amp; I Services Ltd.|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=2001|num=762|parallelcite=[2001] S.T.C. 939|courtname=C.A.|juris=England &amp; Wales}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Sedley referred to the possibility of damages as a remedy,&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte F &amp; I Services Ltd.'', para.&amp;nbsp;72.&lt;/ref&gt; but commented:&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte F &amp; I Services Ltd.'', para.&amp;nbsp;73, quoted in Steele, pp.&amp;nbsp;323–324.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|That [the existing authorities] do not include damages for abuses of power falling short of [[misfeasance in public office|m[is]feasance in public office]] does not necessarily mean that door is closed to them in principle. But the policy implications of such a step are immense, and it may well be that&amp;nbsp;– despite the presence for some years in the rules of a power to award damages on an application for judicial review&amp;nbsp;– a legal entitlement to them cannot now come into being without legislation.}}

The view has been taken that damages are not a suitable remedy when the loss suffered by an individual cannot be assessed meaningfully, but if they can be quantified then ordering an authority to pay compensation is preferable to insisting that it act in a manner that it regards as not being in the public interest. However, fulfilment of the legitimate expectation should be the primary remedy.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, pp. 325–326.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legitimate expectations in other jurisdictions==

===Australia===
Besides applying in the UK, procedural legitimate expectation was approved by the [[Federal Court of Australia]] in ''GTE (Australia) Pty. Ltd. v. Brown'' (1986).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=GTE (Australia) Pty. Ltd.|court=FCA|year=1986|num=364|parallelcite=(1986) 14 F.L.R. 309|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case, the [[Minister of Finance (Australia)|Minister of State for Administrative Services]], acting on behalf of the [[Minister for Industry and Science|Minister of State for Industry and Commerce]], imposed [[dumping (pricing policy)|anti-dumping]] duties on the applicant. The applicant brought legal proceedings claiming that the authorities had denied it natural justice by failing to comply with a promise to provide an opportunity for a hearing towards the close of the investigation on whether the duties should be levied, and by departing from certain procedures. Applying ''Ng Yuen Shiu'' and the ''GCHQ'' case, the Court agreed that the applicant's legitimate expectation had been frustrated by the failure to conduct a hearing, and that it had been unfair for the authorities not to follow the procedures.&lt;ref&gt;''GTE (Australia)'' at paras. 47–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, strong doubts have been expressed about substantive legitimate expectation. In ''Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Lam'' (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Lam|court=HCA|year=2003|num=6|parallelcite=(2003) 214 C.L.R. 1|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[High Court of Australia]] said that the reasoning in ''ex parte Coughlan'' violated the [[separation of powers]] doctrine by overextending the reach of judicial power provided for in section 75(v) of the [[Constitution of Australia]]. In its opinion, the balancing act employed in ''ex parte Coughlan'' should be left to the executive and falls beyond the province of the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Matthew Groves|title=Substantive Legitimate Expectations in Australian Administrative Law|url=http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/files/dmfile/32_2_4.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508163334/http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/files/dmfile/32_2_4.pdf|archivedate=8 May 2015|journal=[[Melbourne University Law Review]]|year=2008|volume=32|issue=2|pages=471–521 at 509–510}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
{{main|Legitimate expectation in Singapore law}}

In Singapore, the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] has recognized that a representation that a consultation will be held before a public authority makes a decision can give rise to a procedural legitimate expectation, though no applicant has successfully established the existence of such an expectation yet.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Siah Mooi Guat'' [1988] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 165 at 172–179, paras. 15–35, H.C. (Singapore); ''Borissik'', pp. 105–106, paras. 46–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the protection of substantive legitimate expectations, in ''Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v. Public Prosecutor'' (1997),&lt;ref&gt;''Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v. Public Prosecutor'' [https://www.webcitation.org/64AUXpWDe?url=http://lwb.lawnet.com.sg/legal/lgl/rss/landmark/%5B1997%5D_SGCA_38.html &amp;#91;1997&amp;#93; SGCA 38], [1997] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 842, [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] (Singapore), archived from [https://www.webcitation.org/64AUXpWDe?url=http://lwb.lawnet.com.sg/legal/lgl/rss/landmark/%5B1997%5D_SGCA_38.html the original]{{cbignore}} on 24 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; a criminal case, the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] relied on the concept of legitimate expectations to support the overruling of an incorrect legal principle prospectively&amp;nbsp;– with effect from the date of the judgment&amp;nbsp;– rather than retrospectively which would be the usual effect of a judgment. It stated that "certain legitimate expectations could, in certain circumstances, be deserving of protection, even though they did not acquire the force of a legal right",&lt;ref&gt;''Abdul Nasir'', p. 858, para. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; although it emphasized it was not considering whether the [[Singapore Prison Service|Prisons Department]] was prevented from carrying out its duties by a legitimate expectation.&lt;ref&gt;''Abdul Nasir'', p. 858, para. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''UDL Marine (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. v. Jurong Town Corp.'' (2011), the High Court doubted whether the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation is part of Singapore law, but did not discuss the matter fully as neither the respondent nor the Attorney-General had made submissions on the issue.&lt;ref name="UDL Marine"/&gt;

{{quote|(a) The applicant must prove that the statement or representation made by the public authority was unequivocal and unqualified;
:(i) if the statement or representation is open to more than one natural interpretation, the interpretation applied by the public authority will be adopted; and
:(ii) the presence of a disclaimer or non-reliance clause would cause the statement or representation to be qualified.
(b) The applicant must prove the statement or representation was made by someone with actual or ostensible authority to do so on behalf of the public authority.&lt;br /&gt;
(c) The applicant must prove that the statement or representation was made to him or to a class of persons to which he clearly belongs.
(d) The applicant must prove that it was reasonable for him to rely on the statement or representation in the circumstances of his case:
:(i) if the applicant knew that the statement or representation was made in error and chose to capitalise on the error, he will not be entitled to any relief;
:(ii) similarly, if he suspected that the statement or representation was made in error and chose not to seek clarification when he could have done so, he will not be entitled to any relief;
:(iii) if there is reason and opportunity to make enquiries and the applicant did not, he will not be entitled to any relief.
(e) The applicant must prove that he did rely on the statement or representation and that he suffered a detriment as a result.&lt;br /&gt;
(f) Even if all the above requirements are met, the court should nevertheless not grant relief if:
:(i) giving effect to the statement or representation will result in a breach of the law or the State’s international obligations;
:(ii) giving effect to the statement or representation will infringe the accrued rights of some member of the public;
:(iii) the public authority can show an overriding national or public interest which justifies the frustration of the applicant's expectation.}}

===Bangladesh===
{{Main|Legitimate expectation in Bangladeshi law}}
Judicial precedents have developed the doctrine of legitimate expectation in Bangladesh since 1987. The criteria of the doctrine was restated in ''Golam Mustafa v. Bangladesh'', which is described in the following.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culaw.ac.bd/jurnal_pdf/9743683E-93D4-4F31-A5D4-C9CED6B2D7B7.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailystar.net/law/2011/01/04/reviewing.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

*I. If there is a promise by the authority expressed either by their representations or conducts.
*II. The decision of the authority was arbitrary or unreasonable within the [[Wednesbury unreasonableness|Wednesbury principle]].
*III. There was a failure on the part of the concerned authority to act fairly in taking the decision.
*IV. The expectation to be crystallized into a legitimate one, it must be based on clear facts and circumstances leading to a definite expectation and not a mere anticipation or a wish or hope and also must be reasonable in the circumstances.
*V. Judicial review may allow such a legitimate expectation and quash the impugned decision even in the absence of a strict legal right unless there is an overriding public interest to defeat such an expectation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culaw.ac.bd/jurnal_pdf/9743683E-93D4-4F31-A5D4-C9CED6B2D7B7.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martha McCaughey'''  (born October 25, 1966) is an American academic and author.  She is the director of [[Women's Studies]] at [[Appalachian State University]].  Her research and writings have dealt extensively with [[evolutionary psychology]] as applied to [[gender]].  Her most recent book is ''The Caveman Mystique: Pop-Darwinism and the Debates over Sex, Violence, and Science'' (2008, Routledge).  This book reveals McCaughey's ability to complicate debates in both feminism and evolutionary science.

==Writings==
Among her writings are two similarly titled books: ''Real Knockouts: the Physical Feminism of Women’s Self-Defense'' ({{ISBN|0-8147-5577-1}}) in 1997 and ''Reel Knockouts: Violent Women in the Movies'' ({{ISBN|0-292-75251-2}}), which she co-edited in 2001 with Neal King.

''Real Knockouts'' made McCaughey's mark in [[feminist theory]], as the first comprehensive attempt to bridge the gap between [[academia]] and mainstream women's [[self-defense]].  In it, she defines the self-defense movement serves as a form of [[feminism|feminist]] [[empowerment]] and [[consciousness raising]] that can be used to make [[feminist theory]] accessible to women who would otherwise be unreceptive.  She also proposes the idea that by participating in self-defense, women change the definition of femininity and alter the [[gender role]]s, both male and female, that support existing [[rape culture]].  Although McCaughey takes a generally positive stance regarding self-defense, and dedicates a chapter to countering various criticisms of women's self-defense from within feminist theory, she does acknowledge and examine several practical and legal concerns with self-defense.  As part of that, she analyzes the legal repercussions of violent self-defense, including consideration of the way that [[racism]], [[classism]], [[sexism]], and stereotypes concerning [[battered woman defence|battered wife syndrome]] affect the legal system's judgement on whether or not a woman's self-defense is legitimate.

''Reel Knockouts'' (co-edited with Neal M. King) is a collection of essays that examine portrayals of violent women in film.

She is also the co-editor, with Michael D. Ayers, of ''Cyberactivism: Online Activism in Theory and Practice'' (2003, Routledge).

Many jurisdictions have laws applying to '''minors and abortion'''. These [[parental consent|parental involvement]] laws require that one or more parents consent or be informed before their [[minor (law)|minor]] daughter may legally have an [[abortion]].

==Minors and abortion in law==

===Australia===

{{Main|Abortion in Australia}}

A minor does not require parental consent or notification except in Western Australia, where in the event of the woman being under 16 years of age one of her parents must be notified, except where permission has been granted by the Children's Court or the woman does not live with her parents.

===Canada===
{{Main|Abortion in Canada}}
In Canada, abortion is subject to general medical legislation, as there are no laws regulating abortion. Access varies by province and by region; though there are no legal restrictions to abortion. Most medical facilities in Canada do not share medical information with a parent without consent of their child who is seeking an abortion. In 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that the woman's partner, the father of the baby, has no right to veto her decision to undergo an abortion. Abortion is funded by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.prochoice.org/canada/legal.html |title=ProChoice.org |access-date=2007-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402201811/http://www.prochoice.org/canada/legal.html |archive-date=2007-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===

{{Main|Abortion in France}}

A pregnant girl under the age of 18 may ask for an abortion without consulting her parents first, but she has to be accompanied to the clinic by an adult of her choice. This adult must not tell her parents or any third party about the abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/guide_ivg-2.pdf Abortion Guide {{fr}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905025157/http://www.sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/guide_ivg-2.pdf |date=2012-09-05 }} pages 34 and 35, from the French Ministry of Health&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===

{{Main|Abortion in Greece}}

Girls under the age of 18 must get written permission from a parent or guardian before being allowed an abortion.

===India===
{{Main|Abortion in India}}
Minor girls under 18 need parental consent. Under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, abortion is permitted on liberal grounds until 20 weeks of pregnancy. Abortions after 20 weeks are illegal, but a court may authorize such a late abortion in exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-41172796&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===

{{Main|Abortion in Italy}}

Parental authorisation is required if the woman is under 18.

===New Zealand===

{{Main|Abortion in New Zealand}}

New Zealand has no parental notification restrictions on under-sixteen access for abortion.

===Norway===

{{Main|Abortion in Norway}}

Parental consent is required if the woman is under 16 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/1975-06-13-50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===

{{Main|Abortion in Poland}}

Parental consent is always required if the woman seeking abortion is a minor.

===South Africa===
{{Main|Abortion in South Africa}}
In South Africa, any woman of any age can get an abortion on request with no reasons given if she is less than 13 weeks pregnant. A woman under the age of 18 will be advised to consult her parents, but she can decide not to inform or consult them if she so chooses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1996]] (Act No. 92 of 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; However, she must give [[informed consent]], meaning that if she is unable to understand the consequences of an abortion she cannot consent to one without the assistance of her parents or [[guardian (law)|guardian]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Lawyers Association v Minister of Health and Others (Reproductive Health Alliance as amicus curiae)'' 2005 (1) SA 509 (T) (24 May 2004), [[Transvaal Provincial Division]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===

{{Main|Abortion in Spain}}

In 2009, the Socialist government passed a bill that states that girls aged 16 and 17 must inform her parents (but does not need parental consent) for an abortion except if the girl comes from an abusive household and such news will cause more strife.

===Sweden===

{{Main|Abortion in Sweden}}

The current legislation is the Abortion Act of 1974. This states that up until the end of the eighteenth week of the pregnancy the choice of an abortion is entirely up to the woman, for any reason whatsoever. The law makes no distinction with regards to the age of the pregnant woman.

===United Kingdom===

{{Main|Abortion in the United Kingdom}}

Parental involvement laws in the UK; if the girl is seen as competent by medical staff no disclosure to parents is allowed. In most cases, girls aged 13 or above will be covered by this provision but pre-teenagers will not and parents, social workers and police can become involved to protect the child. Around 120 12-year-olds, at least five 11-year-olds and two nine-year-olds have had legal abortions since 1996. In 2005, Sue Axon, of Manchester, wanted the law changed to prevent girls under 16 getting confidential advice. However, the High Court had rejected a review of guidelines which state that terminations do not need parents' consent and doctors should respect girls' confidentiality.

In the [[United States]], most states typically require one of two types of parental involvement– consent or notification, or both. 37 states require parental involvement in a minor's decision to have an abortion (21 states require parental consent only, 3 of which require both parents to consent; 11 states require parental notification only, 1 of which requires that both parents be notified; 5 states require both parental consent and notification; 8 states require the parental consent documentation to be notarized).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/parental-involvement-minors-abortions&lt;/ref&gt; In Delaware the law only applies to minors under 16, and in South Carolina to minors under 17.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/preventing-pregnancy-stds/parental-consent-and-notification-laws&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/parental-involvement-minors-abortions&lt;/ref&gt; Parental involvement laws played a key role in forcing the Court to clarify its position on abortion regulation.  The Court ruled, in essence, that parental involvement laws (and all other abortion regulation) can legally make it more difficult for a female to acquire an abortion. But there is a threshold beyond which the increased difficulties become unconstitutional. Requiring spousal involvement before a woman can acquire an abortion has been interpreted as falling on the unconstitutional side of that threshold, while parental involvement has been interpreted as falling on the constitutional side. Or, to use the language of ''[[Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey]]'' (1992), spousal notification laws place an "undue burden" on a woman's ability to get an abortion, whereas parental involvement laws do not.

Parental involvement laws have three basic features. First, they are binding on minors, not adults. Second, they require, at minimum, that minors notify their parents before an abortion is performed, and in some cases consent from the parents. And third, they allow minors to acquire a judicial bypass if consent cannot be acquired. These regulations are but one example of the detailed fabric of abortion legislation and regulation that has evolved since the Supreme Court's decision to legalize abortion in its 1973 ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]''.

The first major case involving parental involvement legislation was decided in 1976 in ''[[Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth]]''. This case involved a Missouri law that required consent from various parties before an abortion could be performed– written consent by the patient, spousal consent for married individuals, and parental consent for minors, specifically. The court ruled that the parental consent provision was unconstitutional due to its universal enforcement.

The ability of a minor to acquire an abortion against her parent's wishes became a recurring theme in several more cases following ''[[Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth]]''. [[Bellotti v. Baird (1979)|''Bellotti v. Baird'' (1979)]] addressed a Massachusetts law that required a minor to acquire parental consent before an abortion was performed. But, unlike the ''Danforth'' case, this law allowed for judicial bypass if consent could not be acquired. Similar reasoning can be found in ''H.L. v. Matheson'' (1981). This case ruled on the relatively milder regulation of parental notification as opposed to parental consent. In this case, the Court ruled that parental notification is constitutional since the parent could not veto the adolescent's final decision to acquire an abortion. In ''Planned Parenthood of Kansas City v. Ashcroft'' (1983), the Supreme Court ruled that parental consent is constitutional so long as it also allowed a judicial bypass if such consent could not be acquired. In ''Planned Parenthood of S.E. Pennsylvania v. Casey'' (1992), the Court placed parental involvement firmly within a broader set of legal principles governing a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. Parental involvement, and other regulations, were constitutional so long that they did not place an "undue burden" on a woman's ability to acquire an abortion. 

In ''Planned Parenthood of Massachusetts v. Attorney General'' (1997), the [[Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts]] found the requirement of ''both'' parents consenting to the minor's abortion unconstitutional, but upheld the parental consent of one parent.&lt;ref&gt;http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/424/424mass586.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] agreed to consider whether the state must begin enforcing a 1995 law requiring parental notification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In ''American Academy of Pediatrics v. Lungren (1997) 16 Cal.4th 307'' the [[Supreme Court of California]] struck down the 1987 parental consent law of the state (which had been enjoined shortly after enactment, and thus never enforced).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/06/us/abortion-law-is-overturned-in-california.html&lt;/ref&gt; This case also made history because it was one of the few cases in the legal history of California where its Supreme Court granted a rehearing of a legal case, after it had previously ruled in ''American Academy of Pediatrics v. Lungren (1996) 51 Cal.Rptr.2d 201'' that the law was constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atthelectern.com/when-a-rehearing-petition-is-almost-a-certainty-and-rehearing-a-legitimate-possibility/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
{{US-centric|section|date=June 2014}}
===Arguments in support===
Advocacy groups have made a number of arguments in favor of parental notification.

* Minors must have parental approval for most types of [[surgery|medical procedures]].&lt;ref name="Age of Majority"&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/wests-law-encyclopedia/age-majority "Age of Majority"].

* The pregnant minor might be pressured into having an abortion by an older boyfriend or abusive partner, so as to conceal the fact that he is guilty of rape or [[statutory rape]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahkorn, "Pregnancy and Sexual Assault", The Psychological Aspects of Abortion, eds. Mall &amp; Watts, (Washington, D.C., University Publications of America, 1979) 55-69&lt;/ref&gt;
* Currently, the parents of the minor are financially responsible for any complications resulting from the abortion, unless said minor has been legally emancipated.&lt;ref name="Age of Majority"/&gt;  

===Arguments in opposition===
Advocacy groups on the other side have also made a number of arguments against parental notification:

*Parental notification and consent laws increase the number of unsafe, illegal abortions.
::* Women's health organizations say that in states that have notification or consent laws, there has been an increase in unsafe, illegal, [[back-alley abortion|"back alley" abortions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.choicematters.org/?page_id=47 Choice Matters: Good Reasons to Oppose Parental Consent Laws]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pro Choice America In Your State"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/download-files/2011-who-decides.pdf |title=Pro Choice America "The Status of Women’s Reproductive Rights in the United States" |access-date=2013-05-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121064411/http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/download-files/2011-who-decides.pdf |archive-date=2013-01-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
::* Many young women feel they cannot talk to their parents about their sex lives or about rape or incest that they may have suffered, and may or may not seek illegal abortions as a result.&lt;ref name="Pro Choice America In Your State"/&gt;
* In states that have notification or consent laws, minors will sometimes travel to a nearby state to have an abortion.&lt;ref name="ReligiousTolerance.org"/&gt; Delays mean increased risks:

::*Delaying an abortion may increase the likelihood of complications arising from abortion procedures. Major complications and risk of death to the mother significantly increase for each week into pregnancy, particularly if the abortion is delayed until the third trimester.&lt;ref name="ReligiousTolerance.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Medical Association, "Induced Termination of Pregnancy Before and After Roe v. Wade, Trends in the Mortality and Morbidity of Women", JAMA, Vol. 268, # 22 (1992-DEC), Page 3238.&lt;/ref&gt;
::*Judge Nixon of The District Court in Tennessee estimated "that even under the best of circumstances, the [judicial] waiver process would take twenty-two days to complete – a significant problem given the time-sensitive nature of pregnancy and the increased risk involved in later abortions."&lt;ref&gt;CARAL Reproductive Health and right Center, [http://www.choice.org/11.minors.TN.html "District Court Invalidates Tennessee Parental Consent for Abortions" Choice.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
::*The American Academy of Pediatrics issued the following statement: "Legislation mandating parental involvement does not achieve the '''intended benefit of promoting family communication''', but it does increase the risk of harm to the adolescent by delaying access to appropriate medical care...[M]inors should not be compelled or required to involve their parents in their decisions to obtain abortions, although they should be encouraged to discuss their pregnancies with their parents and other responsible adults."&lt;ref&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Adolescence, "The Adolescent's Right to Confidential Care When Considering Abortion", Pediatrics, Vol. 97, # 5 (1996-MAY), Page 746.&lt;/ref&gt;
::*A study of abortions by researchers at Baruch College at City University of New York showed that Texas teens who were between 17 years, 6 months old and 18 years old were 34% more likely to have an abortion in the much riskier second trimester than young women who were 18 or older when they became pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lisa Falkenberg (journalist)|Lisa Falkenberg]]: [http://www.chron.com/ "Study: Texas parental law might lower– and delay– teen abortion" Houston Chronicle, 2006-MAR-09]&lt;/ref&gt;
::*Lawrence Finer, spokesperson for the Guttmacher Institute said: "It just shows how laws like this can lead to health risks for teens. Abortion is a safe procedure, but it's less safe later in the pregnancy." He suggest that parental involvement laws have a small effect on abortion rates compared with improved sexual education and birth control access and usage.
* Many minors of childbearing age are sufficiently mature to make abortion decisions by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/443/622/case.html BELLOTTI V. BAIRD, 443 U. S. 622 (1979)] - Declares a Massachusetts parental consent law unconstitutional because it doesn't allow minors who are mature enough to consent to forgo parental consent requirements via a judicial bypass.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Other reproductive health issues such as STD testing and treatment do not require parental consent.

===Stance of the Roman Catholic Church===
In 2009, Archbishop [[José Cardoso Sobrinho]] [[2009 Brazilian girl abortion case|excommunicated]], or rather declared excommunicated (since the canon law invoked imposes the excommunication automatically), the mother and doctors of a 9-year-old girl for carrying out an [[abortion]] on the girl's twin fetuses. The girl was impregnated by her own stepfather, who had repeatedly raped her since she was six years old. The doctors recommended the abortion because they believed the girl's youth would prevent her from delivering the twins safely. The affair shocked the Brazilian government&lt;ref name="Brazil Catholic Church Excommunicates Doctors Who Did Abortion on Little Girl"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lifenews.com/int1112.html|title=Brazil Catholic Church Excommunicates Doctors Who Did Abortion on Little Girl|last=Ertelt|first=Steven|date=2008-03-05|publisher=Lifenews.com|accessdate=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provoked disgust from President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]].

Pope Benedict XVI later gave a controversial [[speech]] in [[Angola]] where he condemned all forms of abortion, even those considered to be therapeutic. [[Therapeutic abortion]] is the term for abortions that are typically performed to save the life of the mother or in which the fetus has been found to have a defect incompatible with life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africasia.com/services/news/newsitem.php?area=africa&amp;item=090320173136.oj0etfn2.php Pope reiterates church ban on abortion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120630031132/http://www.oecumene.radiovaticana.org/fr1/Articolo.asp?c=274622 Radio Vatican]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4473">The '''Moresby Treaty''' was an anti-slavery [[treaty]] made between [[Sayyid Said]], Sultan of Muscat and Oman and [[Fairfax Moresby]], senior officer of Mauritius,&lt;ref&gt;Nicolini, B., &amp; Watson, P. (2004). ''Makran, Oman, and Zanzibar: Three-terminal Cultural Corridor in the Western Indian Ocean'', 1799-1856.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially composed of six articles,&lt;ref&gt;Nicolini, B., &amp; Watson, P. (2004). ''Makran, Oman, and Zanzibar: Three-terminal Cultural Corridor in the Western Indian Ocean'', 1799-1856. Leiden: Brill Academic Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; the purpose of the treaty was to limit the [[African slave trade#Indian Ocean trade|Indian Ocean slave trade]] by preventing the importation of slaves to British holdings in [[India]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] from land ruled by Omani Arabs in [[East Africa]].&lt;ref name="Nwulia" /&gt; The treaty barred the sale of slaves to Christians of any nationality,&lt;ref&gt;Nicolini, B., &amp; Watson, P. (2004). ''Makran, Oman, and Zanzibar: Three-terminal Cultural Corridor in the Western Indian Ocean'', 1799-1856. Leiden: Brill Academic Pub., p.133
&lt;/ref&gt; recognized the sultan’s jurisdiction over the waters near the East African coast,&lt;ref name="Nicolinithirtyfour"&gt;Nicolini, B., &amp; Watson, P. (2004). ''Makran, Oman, and Zanzibar: Three-terminal Cultural Corridor in the Western Indian Ocean'', 1799-1856. Leiden: Brill Academic Pub., p.134
&lt;/ref&gt; allowed for the installation of a British official in [[Zanzibar]] or the mainland,&lt;ref name="Nwulia" /&gt; and created the Moresby Line.

==The Moresby Line==
Among the stipulations was the creation of the Moresby Line. The line ran from the southernmost point of the sultan’s territory in Africa – [[Cape Delgado]] in Mozambique - through the Indian Ocean to the city of [[Diu, India|Diu]] on the coast of India.&lt;ref name="Mc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicolinithirtyfour" /&gt; The transportation of slaves west of the established line, a primarily Muslim zone of the Indian Ocean,&lt;ref&gt;Clarence-Smith, W. G. (2006). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nQbylEdqJKkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Islam and the abolition of slavery]''. New York: Oxford University Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; was at this point considered legal but prohibited on the eastern side.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, E., &amp; Reynolds, J. T. (2008). ''Africa in World History: From Prehistory to the Present.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson College Div., p. 233
&lt;/ref&gt; To enforce this rule, warships were given the authority to confiscate ships carrying slaves in illegal waters east of the line and punish the captain in the same manner as a [[pirate]], by “death without the [[benefit of clergy]]”.&lt;ref name="Nicolinithirtyfour" /&gt; The only exemption to this regulation provided for ships that had gone past the line due to conditions beyond their control including extreme weather conditions.&lt;ref name="Nwulia" /&gt; Confusion arose as to who exactly was to enforce this part of the treaty as the English version of the text placed responsibility on the Omanis while the Arab text placed the onus on the British.&lt;ref name="Nicolinithirtyfour" /&gt;

==Amendment==
On December 17, 1839 the treaty was expanded in scope, adding three more articles to the original agreement.&lt;ref name="Nicolinifortythree"&gt;Nicolini, B., &amp; Watson, P. (2004). ''Makran, Oman, and Zanzibar: Three-terminal Cultural Corridor in the Western Indian Ocean'', 1799-1856. Leiden: Brill Academic Pub., p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; The extension increased the area in which the transportation of slaves was considered illegal by moving the endpoint of the Moresby Line west to the port of Pasni on the Makran Coast.&lt;ref name="Nicolinifortythree" /&gt; Additionally, the amendment prohibited the sale of Somalis as slaves because, as [[Muslim]]s, they were considered ‘free men’ by the Omani ruler who was a Muslim himself.&lt;ref name="Nwulia" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3788">A '''city charter''' or '''town charter''' (generically, '''municipal charter''') is a legal [[document]] (''[[charter]]'') establishing a [[municipality]] such as a [[city]] or [[town]].  The concept developed in [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]].

Traditionally the granting of a charter gave a settlement and its inhabitants the right to [[town privileges]] under the [[Feudalism|feudal system]].  Townspeople who lived in chartered towns were [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]], as opposed to [[serfs]] who lived in villages.  Towns were often "[[Free imperial city|free]]", in the sense that they were directly protected by the king or emperor, and were not part of a feudal [[Fiefdom|fief]].

Today the process for granting is determined by the type of government of the state in question.  In monarchies, charters are still often a [[royal charter]] given by [[the Crown]] or the state authorities acting on behalf of the Crown.  In federations, the granting of charters may be within the jurisdiction of the lower level of government such as  [[province]].

==Canada==
{{main article|Local government in Canada}}
In Canada charters are granted by [[provinces and territories of Canada|provincial authorities]].

==Philippines==
{{main article|Cities of the Philippines}}
Since the beginning of American colonial rule, Philippines cities were formally established through laws enacted by the various national legislatures in the country. The [[Philippine Commission]] gave the city of Manila its charter in 1901, while the city of Baguio was established by the [[Philippine Assembly]] which was composed by elected members instead of appointed ones. During the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth era]], the [[National Assembly of the Philippines|National Assembly]] established an additional ten cities. Since achieving independence from the United States in 1946 the [[Congress of the Philippines|Philippine Congress]] has established 124 more cities (as of September 2007), the majority of which required the holding of a [[plebiscite]] within the proposed city's jurisdiction to ratify the city's charter.

== Sweden ==
In [[Sweden]] until 1951, cities were established by [[royal charter]]; see [[City status in Sweden]].

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], towns and cities are established by [[royal charter]]; see [[city status in the United Kingdom]].

==United States==
In the [[United States]], such [[charter]]s are established either directly by a [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] by means of [[local legislation]], or indirectly under a general [[municipal corporation]] [[law]], usually after the proposed charter has passed a [[referendum]] vote of the affected population.

A municipal charter is the basic document that defines the organization, powers, functions and essential procedures of the city government. The charter is, therefore, the most important legal document of any city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlc.org/build-skills-and-networks/resources/cities-101/city-structures/municipal-charters|title=Municipal Charters|website=www.nlc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipalities without charters, in states where such exist, are known as [[general-law municipality|general-law municipalities or cities]].

A '''Necessity and Urgency Decree'''&lt;ref&gt;The National News agency of Argentina, [[Télam]] translates ''decreto de necesidad y urgencia'' as ''Necessity and Urgency Decree'': [http://english.telam.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8325:the-necessity-and-urgency-decree-is-enforcedq-stated-miguel-angel-pichetto&amp;catid=42:politics "The Necessity and Urgency Decree is enforced", stated Miguel Angel Pichetto]&lt;/ref&gt; (Spanish: ''Decreto de necesidad y urgencia'', also known as '''DNU''') is a special kind of order issued by the [[President of Argentina|President]] of Argentina. Unlike regular decrees, which are used in Argentina for [[rulemaking]], a DNU has the force of law. Once the President promulgates a DNU, it [[Coming into force|comes into force]] almost immediately; afterwards, the [[Argentine National Congress|National Congress]] must examine the decree to determine whether it will be allowed to remain in force or not.&lt;ref name="const99"&gt;[http://www.senado.gov.ar/web/interes/constitucion/ejecutivo.php Constitución Nacional] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211143136/http://www.senado.gov.ar/web/interes/constitucion/ejecutivo.php |date=February 11, 2010 }}. Senado.gov.ar. Retrieved on 2012-06-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
[[File:Buenos Aires - Palacio del Congreso de la Nación Argentina -HDR- 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Argentine National Congress]] must evaluate every Necessity and Urgency Decree.]]
The possibility to promulgate DNUs is established in the article 99 of the [[Constitution of Argentina]] since 1994. As its name indicates, a Necessity and Urgency Decree is to be used only under exceptional situations, when it is not possible to follow the normal procedure to create laws in the Congress. In addition, the President cannot sanction DNUs legislating about criminal, tributary or electoral matters.&lt;ref name="const99" /&gt;

As with regular decrees, Necessity and Urgency Decrees are promulgated by the President, but only with "General Agreement of Ministers" (Spanish: ''Acuerdo general de ministros''). It means that all Ministers and the [[Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers|Chief of Staff]] must take part in the DNU's creation.&lt;ref name="const99" /&gt;

Once the Necessity and Urgency Decree is sanctioned, the Chief of Staff must send the DNU to the [[Permanent Bicameral Committee]] of the Congress in no more than ten days. Then, the Bicameral Committee delivers its report to the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Argentine Senate|Senate]]. The Committee has also ten days to elaborate the report. During all this process, the DNU is completely in force.&lt;ref name="const99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ley"&gt;[http://infoleg.mecon.gov.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/115000-119999/118261/norma.htm Regimen Legal De Los Decretos De Necesidad Y Urgencia, De Delegacion Legislativa Y De Promulgacion Parcial De Leyes]. Infoleg.mecon.gov.ar. Retrieved on 2012-06-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each legislative chamber must deliver a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] expressing its approval or rejection of the Necessity and Urgency Decree. If both chambers reject the DNU, it loses validity permanently. However, any rights acquired by people affected by the decree are not automatically terminated.&lt;ref name="ley" /&gt;

== Background ==

=== In military governments ===
All legislation issued by [[military dictatorship]]s in Argentina was made by the [[Executive (government)|executive]]. These kinds of orders were known as ''decree-law'' (Spanish: ''decreto ley''). Under the self-called ''[[History of Argentina (1966–1973)|Argentine Revolution]]'' and the ''[[National Reorganization Process]]'' (the two latest military governments), the ''decree-laws'' were known simply as ''laws''.

Because they were [[De facto government doctrine|''de facto'' governments]], there was a legal controversy about the validity of decree-laws. In 1945, the [[Supreme Court of Argentina]] accepted them only if they were needed to fulfill the aims of the government. When the military government dissolved and civilian rule was reestablished, the decree-laws were no longer valid, unless the Congress ratified them.&lt;ref name="corte"&gt;[http://www.salvador.edu.ar/juri/reih/2da/I05.pdf HISTORIA IDEOLÓGICA DE LA CORTE SUPREMA DE JUSTICIA DE LA NACIÓN 1947–1955] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121209180638/http://www.salvador.edu.ar/juri/reih/2da/I05.pdf |date=December 9, 2012 }}. Universidad del Salvador. IUSHISTORIA (Revista Electrónica) Nº 2. October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, a new judgment by the Supreme Court established that decree-laws would remain valid after the end of the ''de facto'' government that promulgated them, and they could be abolished or modified in the same manner as other laws.&lt;ref name="corte" /&gt;

=== In constitutional governments ===
Although DNUs were introduced in their present form in the National Constitution in 1994, previous constitutional Presidents have used this type of decree. One example is the ''Austral Plan'', which changed the national currency from the [[Argentine peso argentino|peso argentino]] to the [[Argentine austral|Austral]]. This was sanctioned by the President [[Raúl Alfonsín]] in 1985, using the decree 1096/85.&lt;ref name="polarg"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110715102325/http://www.politicargentina.com/analisis-politico/632-la-necesidad-de-decretar-la-urgencia La necesidad de decretar la urgencia]. politicargentina.com (2009-11-30)&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Argentina uses the [[Argentine peso|peso]] as its national currency.

In December 1990, the Supreme Court approved the sanction of Necessity and Urgency Decree in the so-called ''Peralta Case'', in which Luis Peralta requested to declare [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] the decree 36/90, that President Menem promulgated in 1990. The judges of the Court eventually confirmed the validity of the DNU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todoiure.com.ar/monografias/mono/civil/caso_peralta.htm Caso Peralta]. Todoiure.com.ar. Retrieved on 2012-06-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.hcdn.gov.ar/dependencias/ari/Informes/informe_decretos.pdf La legitimidad del dictado de los decretos de necesidad y urgencia]. hcdn.gov.ar&lt;/ref&gt;

== Irregularities ==
Despite the fact that the Constitution says the Congress must create a special law to analyze Necessity and Urgency Decrees, this law was created in 2006, twelve years after the [[1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution]], when the DNU were introduced. It means that all Presidents who ruled in this period ([[Carlos Menem]], [[Fernando de la Rúa]], [[Adolfo Rodríguez Saá]], [[Eduardo Duhalde]] and [[Néstor Kirchner]]) could issue DNU's with no legislative control.&lt;ref name="clarin"&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2006/06/26/elpais/p-01010.htm El control de los DNU, una vieja deuda de la política]. Clarin.com (June 26, 2006). Retrieved on 2012-06-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, they are DNU's which were created with no real need or urgency, such as the decrees that modify the Ministries Law to create new executive departments.&lt;ref name="dnuleymin"&gt;[http://infoleg.mecon.gov.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/155000-159999/158299/texact.htm Decreto 1365/2009.

== Statistics since 1994 ==
{{outdated|section|date=August 2016}}
[[Eduardo Duhalde]], interim President between 2002 and 2003, was the President who signed more DNU's per year since the 1983 return to civilian rule. He promulgated 158 DNU's in one year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://redaccionrosario.com/noticias/?q=node/7386 Diario digital producido por la Cooperativa La Masa]. Redaccion Rosario. Retrieved on 2012-06-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Those decrees were neither checked by the Congress.

[[Néstor Kirchner]] (2003–2007) promulgated 270 Necessity and Urgency Decrees in four years and a half. His DNU's released until 2006 were not controlled by the Congress.&lt;ref name="nacion01"&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1003971 Kirchner firmó cada seis días un decreto de necesidad y urgencia – 13.04.2008 – lanacion.com]. Lanacion.com.ar (April 13, 2008). Retrieved on 2012-06-07.&lt;/ref&gt; His average is 60 Necessity and Urgency Decrees per year.

During the presidency of [[Carlos Menem]] (1989–1999), he signed 545 DNU's in ten years, or 54.5 per year.&lt;ref name="nacion01" /&gt; None of his Necessity and Urgency Decrees were analyzed by the [[Legislature|legislative]] branch of the government.

In [[Fernando de la Rúa]]'s two-years presidency (1999–2001), 73 special decrees were released. His average was thus 36.5 DNU's per year.&lt;ref name="nacion01" /&gt; The decrees signed by De la Rúa were not analyzed by the Bicameral Committee.

During the presidency of [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] (2007&amp;ndash;2015) she signed five Necessity and Urgency Decrees until March 2009.&lt;ref name="nm1"&gt;[http://www.nuevamayoria.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1304&amp;Itemid=30 En 15 meses de gobierno, Cristina Kirchner firmó 5 decretos de necesidad y urgencia].

'''Neomercantilism''' is a policy regime that encourages exports, discourages imports, controls capital movement, and centralizes currency decisions in the hands of a central government. The objective of neo-mercantilist policies is to increase the level of [[foreign reserves]] held by the government, allowing more effective [[monetary policy]] and [[fiscal policy]].

[[File:Common clownfish.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Is it material composition, or organization of parts, that creates the mutual [[symbiosis]] between [[Amphiprion]] [[clownfish]] and tropical [[sea anemone]]s?]]
'''Organicism''' is the philosophical perspective which views the [[universe]] and its parts as organic wholes and – either by analogy or literally – as living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;"The theory that everything in nature has an organic basis or is part of an organic whole" [[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt; It can be synonymous with [[holism]].&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; Organicism is an important tradition within the history of [[natural philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;For example, the philosophers of the [[Ionian Enlightenment]] were referred to by later philosophers (such as Aristotle) as ''[[Hylozoism|hylozoists]]'' meaning 'those who thought that matter was alive' (see [[Benjamin Farrington|Farrington]] (1941/53)&lt;/ref&gt; where it has remained as a vital current alongside [[reductionism]] and [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], the approaches that have dominated science since the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;For a general overview see [[Fritjof Capra|Capra]] (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] is among the earliest philosophers to have regarded the universe as an intelligent living being (see ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''). Organicism flourished for a period during the era of [[German romanticism]]&lt;ref&gt;In particular the writings of [[Friedrich Schelling]] and [[Goethe]]&lt;/ref&gt; during which time the new science of biology was first defined by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]. Within modern-day [[Biology|biological]] [[sciences]] organicism is the approach that stresses the organization (particularly the [[self-organization|self-organizing]] properties), rather than the composition, of [[organism]]s. [[John Scott Haldane]] was the first biologist to use the term to describe his philosophical views in 1917, after which it was followed by certain other biologists in the 20th century.

==In philosophy==

Organicism as a doctrine rejects mechanism and [[reductionism]] (doctrines that claim that the smallest parts by themselves explain the behavior of larger organized systems of which they are a part). However, organicism also rejects [[vitalism]], the doctrine that there is a vital force different from physical forces that accounts for living things. As Capra&lt;ref name= "Capra" &gt;Fritjof Capra. The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems. Anchor Books Doubleday, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; puts it, both schools, organicism and vitalism, were born from the quest for getting rid of the Cartesian picture of reality, a view that has been claimed to be the most destructive paradigm nowadays, from science to politics.&lt;ref&gt;What The Bleep Do We Know – Down The Rabbit Hole. Samuel Goldwyn Films. Roadside attractions. Documentary film, Drama. February 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of biologists in the early to mid-twentieth century embraced organicism. They wished to reject earlier vitalisms but to stress that whole organism biology was not fully explainable by atomic mechanism. The larger organization of an organic system has features that must be taken into account to explain its behavior.

Gilbert and Sarkar distinguish organicism from holism to avoid what they see as the vitalistic or spiritualistic connotations of holism. Dusek notes that holism contains a continuum of degrees of the top-down control of organization, ranging from [[monism]] (the doctrine that the only complete object is the whole universe, or that there is only one entity, the universe)  to organicism, which allows relatively more independence of the parts from the whole, despite the whole being more than the sum of the parts, and/or the whole exerting some control on the behavior of the parts.

Still more independence is present in relational holism. This doctrine does not assert top-down control of the whole over its parts, but does claim that the relations of the parts are essential to explanation of behavior of the system. Aristotle and early modern philosophers and scientists tended to describe reality as made of substances and their qualities, and to neglect relations. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] showed the bizarre conclusions to which a doctrine of the non-existence of relations led. Twentieth century philosophy has been characterized by the introduction of and emphasis on the importance of relations, whether in [[symbolic logic]], in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], or in metaphysics.

[[William C. Wimsatt|William Wimsatt]] has suggested that the number of terms in the relations considered distinguishes reductionism from holism. Reductionistic explanations claim that two or at most three term relations are sufficient to account for the system's behavior. At the other extreme the system could be considered as a single ten to the twenty-sixth term relation, for instance.

Organicism has some intellectually and politically controversial or suspect associations. "Holism," the doctrine that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, often used synonymously with organicism, or as a broader category under which organicism falls, has been co-opted in recent decades by "[[holistic medicine]]" and by [[New Age]] Thought. German [[Nazism]] appealed to organicist and holistic doctrines, discrediting for many in retrospect, the original organicist doctrines. (See Anne Harrington). Soviet [[Dialectical Materialism]] also made appeals to an holistic and organicist approach stemming from [[Hegel]] via [[Karl Marx]]'s co-worker [[Friedrich Engels]], again giving a controversial political association to organicism.

Organicism' has also been used to characterize notions put forth by various late 19th-century social scientists who considered human society to be analogous to an organism, and individual humans to be analogous to the cells of an organism. This sort of organicist sociology was articulated by Alfred Espinas, [[Paul von Lilienfeld]], Jacques Novicow, [[Albert Schäffle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[René Worms]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Barberis, "In search of an object: organicist sociology and the reality of society in fin-de-siècle France", History of the Human Sciences, Vol. 16, No. 3, 2003. Page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Hobbes]] arguably put forward a form of organicism. In the ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', he argued that the state is like a secular God whose constituents (individual people) make up a larger organism.

==In biology==

In breathing entities, cells – i.e., the smallest unit of life – were first observed in the 17th century, when the multifaceted equipment microscope was conceived. Before that period, the individual organisms were studied as a whole in a field known as organismic biology; that area of research remains an important component of the biological sciences.&lt;ref&gt;"biology". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2016. Web. 19 Jan. 2016 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/science/biology&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, as Capra&lt;ref name= "Capra" /&gt; puts it, during the early 1900s, the quantum researchers struggled with the same paradigm shift from "the parts to the whole" that culminated into the scholars of organismic biology.

In biology organicism considers that the observable structures of life, its overall form and the properties and characteristics of its component parts are  a result of the reciprocal play of all the components on each other.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3745903 https://www.jstor.org/pss/3745903 Organicism in Biology]'', Joseph Needham,  Journal of Philosophical Studies''  1928 . Accessed Jan 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples of 20th century biologists who were organicists are [[Ross Granville Harrison|Ross Harrison]], [[Paul Alfred Weiss|Paul Weiss]], and [[Joseph Needham]]. [[Donna Haraway]] discusses them in her first book ''Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields''. [[John Scott Haldane]] (father of [[J. B. S. Haldane]]), [[William Emerson Ritter]], [[E. S. Russell|Edward Stuart Russell]], [[Joseph Henry Woodger]], [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], and Ralph Stayner Lillie are other early twentieth century organicists. [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]], founder of "Relational Biology" provided a comprehensive mathematical and category-theoretic treatment of irreducible causal relations he believed to be responsible for life.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, R. 1991. "Life Itself: A Comprehensive Inquiry Into the Nature, Origin, and Fabrication of Life". Columbia University Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical Biology Club===

In the early 1930s [[Joseph Henry Woodger]] and [[Joseph Needham]], together with [[C. H. Waddington|Conrad Hal Waddington]], [[John Desmond Bernal]], Dorothy Needham, and [[Dorothy Wrinch]], formed the [[Theoretical Biology Club]], to promote the organicist approach to [[biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life Organic|last=Peterson|first=Erik|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=2017|isbn=9780822944669|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was in opposition to [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], [[reductionism]] and the [[gene-centric view of evolution]]. Most of the members were influenced by the philosophy of [[Alfred North Whitehead]].&lt;ref&gt;Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain, 2001, Peter J. Bowler&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A history of molecular biology, Michel Morange, Matthew Cobb, 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge scientific minds, Peter Michael Harman, Simon Mitton, 2002, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greater than the parts: holism in biomedicine, 1920–1950, Christopher Lawrence, George Weisz, Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The club disbanded as the Rockefeller Foundation refused to fund their investigations.&lt;ref&gt;The future of DNA, Johannes Wirz, Edith T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13407">'''Proportionality''' is a general principle in law which covers several special (although related) concepts. The concept of proportionality is used as a criterion of fairness and justice in [[statutory interpretation]] processes, especially in constitutional law, as a logical method intended to assist in discerning the correct balance between the restriction imposed by a corrective measure and the severity of the nature of the prohibited act. Within [[criminal law]], it is used to convey the idea that the punishment of an offender should fit the crime. Under [[international humanitarian law]] governing the [[laws of war|legal use of force]] in an [[armed conflict]], ''proportionality'' and ''[[distinction (law)|distinction]]'' are important factors in assessing [[military necessity]].

==History==
The principle of [[guilt (law)|guilt]] is an [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] standard on which the 17th century [[Bloody Code]] of England emerged, which specified the [[death penalty]] even for minor crimes. 

In the 18th century [[Cesare Beccaria]] published [[On Crimes and Punishments]] which was to form the basis of [[penology]] based on the [[Social justice|relative standard]] of [[culpability]]. As a result [[Jeremy Bentham]] developed the idea of the [[panopticon]] in which prisoners would simply be watched, rather than subjected to [[corporal punishment]]. The idea in practice became a cruel and ineffective corrective.

A more sophisticated concept of proportionality that was testable in law was first developed in the High State Administrative Courts (''Oberlandesgericht'') in [[Germany]] in the late 19th century, to review actions by the police.{{sfn|Hirschberg|1981|p=6}}

The proportionality test originated systematically with the jurisprudence of the German Constitutional Court, the Bundesverfassungsgericht.&lt;ref&gt;BVerfGE 3, 383, 399 (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union law==
{{See also|European Union law}}
In European Union law there are generally acknowledged to be four stages to a proportionality test, namely,&lt;ref&gt;P Craig and G de Burca, ''[[EU Law]]'' (5th edn OUP 2011) 526&lt;/ref&gt;
* there must be a legitimate aim for a measure
* the measure must be suitable to achieve the aim (potentially with a requirement of evidence to show it will have that effect)
* the measure must be necessary to achieve the aim, that there cannot be any less onerous way of doing it
* the measure must be reasonable, considering the competing interests of different groups at hand

It is, however, often seen that the third and fourth criterion are often merged into one by the [[European Court of Justice]], depending on the margin of discretion that the Court sees as being afforded to the member state. Examples are found in ''[[R (Seymour-Smith) v Secretary of State for Employment]]'', where the ECJ points out that a member state has some discretion in the policies it pursues, surrounding [[unfair dismissal]], in reducing unemployment. Further examples of the proportionality test are seen in ''[[Mangold v Helm]]'' and ''[[Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH &amp; Co KG]]''.

==Australia==
While the European Union has placed a consistent focus on the proportionality test in the context of policy issues, namely human rights, the proportionality test in the Australian context is a matter of constitutional interpretation with respect to legislative power under the Constitution. Unlike Europe, the proportionality test as a means to characterize whether Commonwealth legislation falls under a head of power under [[section 51 of the Constitution of Australia]],&lt;ref name="s51"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution|51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has attracted divergent viewpoints, in which [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Kirby J]] has remarked that the 'test has not enjoyed universal favour'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|29|1996|litigants=Leask v Commonwealth |parallelcite=(1996) 187 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 579 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Owen Dixon|Dixon]] [[Chief Justice of Australia|CJ]] made clear that 'the question is essentially one of connexion, not appropriateness of proportionality, and where a sufficient connexion is established, it is not for the Court to judge whether the law is inappropriate or disproportionate'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|30|1952|litigants=Burton v Honan |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1952/30.pdf (1952) 86 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 169] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal law==
In criminal law, the principle of [[proportional justice]] is used to describe the idea that the punishment of a certain crime should be in proportion to the severity of the crime itself. In practice, systems of law differ greatly on the application of this principle. In some systems, this was interpreted as ''[[lex talionis]]'', (an eye for an eye). In others, it has led to a more restrictive manner of sentencing. For example, all European Union countries have accepted as a treaty obligation that no crime warrants the [[death penalty]], whereas some other countries in the world do use it.

In self-defense cases, the amount of force employed by the defender must be proportionate to the threatened aggressive force. If deadly force is used to defend against non-deadly force, the harm inflicted by the actor (death or serious bodily harm) will be greater than the harm avoided (less than serious bodily harm). Even if deadly force is proportionate, its use must be necessary. Otherwise, unlawful conduct will only be justified when it involves the lesser harm of two harmful choices. If countering with non-deadly force or with no force at all avoids the threatened harm, defensive use of deadly force is no longer the lesser evil of only two choices. Alternatives involving still less societal harm are available.

In [[Law of the United States|United States Law]], the [[United States Supreme Court]] proposed the Proportionality Doctrine in three cases during the 1980s, namely ''[[Enmund v. Florida]]'' (1982), ''[[Solem v. Helm]]'' (1983) and ''[[Tison v. Arizona]]'' (1987), to clarify this key principle of proportionality within the [[Cruel and Unusual Punishment]] Clause of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]. The fundamental principle behind proportionality is that the punishment should fit the crime. In 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that courts must do three things to decide whether a sentence is proportional to a specific crime:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=463&amp;invol=277 |title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Compare the nature and gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty,
# Compare the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same [[jurisdiction]]; i.e., whether more serious crimes are subject to the same penalty or to less serious penalties, and
# Compare the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.

Proportionality is also present in other areas of municipal law, such as civil procedure.  For example, it is embodied in Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(2)(C), which considers whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_26 |title=Rule 26. Duty to Disclose; General Provisions Governing Discovery &amp;#124; Federal Rules of Civil Procedure &amp;#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Proportionality is a key consideration in the discovery process, and has been applied to e-discovery, where it has been attributed with significant cost-savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kozubek |first=Michael |url=http://www.insidecounsel.com/2011/03/01/proportionality-doctrine-reduces-ediscovery-abuses-and-costs |title=Proportionality Doctrine Reduces E-Discovery Costs and Abuses |publisher=Insidecounsel.com |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that proportionality will be applied to new and developing areas of law, such as the law of legal technology.

==International humanitarian law==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Allegations of war crimes in the 2006 Lebanon War]] --&gt;
The harm caused to [[civilians]] or civilian [[property]] must be proportional and not "excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated" by an attack on a military objective.&lt;ref name="military objective"&gt;Article 52 of ''Additional [[Protocol I]] to the [[Geneva Conventions]] provides a widely accepted definition of military objective: "In so far as objects are concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage", {{harv|Moreno-Ocampo|2006|p=5, footnote 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Shamash|2005–2006}}

[[Luis Moreno-Ocampo]] was the [[Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court|Chief Prosecutor]] at the [[International Criminal Court]] who investigated allegations of [[war crime]]s during the [[International Criminal Court and the 2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 invasion of Iraq]]. He published an open letter containing his findings; in a section titled "Allegations concerning War Crimes", he elucidates this use of ''proportionality'':
{{quotation|Under international humanitarian law and the [[Rome Statute]], the death of civilians during an armed conflict, no matter how grave and regrettable, does not in itself constitute a war crime. International humanitarian law and the Rome Statute permit belligerents to carry out proportionate attacks against military objectives,&lt;ref name="military objective"/&gt; even when it is known that some civilian deaths or injuries will occur. A crime occurs if there is an intentional attack directed against civilians (principle of distinction) (Article 8(2)(b)(i)) or an attack is launched on a military objective in the knowledge that the incidental civilian injuries would be clearly excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage (principle of proportionality) (Article 8(2)(b)(iv)).

Article 8(2)(b)(iv) criminalizes:&lt;br /&gt;
Intentionally launching an attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects or widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated;&lt;br /&gt;
Article 8(2)(b)(iv) draws on the principles in Article 51(5)(b) of the 1977 Additional [[Protocol I]] to the 1949 [[Geneva Conventions]], but restricts the criminal prohibition to cases that are "''clearly''" excessive. The application of Article 8(2)(b)(iv) requires, ''[[inter alia]]'', an assessment of:&lt;br /&gt;
(a) the anticipated civilian damage or injury;&lt;br /&gt;
(b) the anticipated military advantage;&lt;br /&gt;
(c) and whether (a) was "clearly excessive" in relation to (b).|[[Luis Moreno-Ocampo]].{{sfn|Moreno-Ocampo|2006|pp=4&amp;ndash;5. See section "Allegations concerning War Crimes"}} }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5055">'''Redistributive change''' is a [[legal theory]] of [[economic justice]] in the context of [[U.S. law]] that promotes the recognition of [[poverty]] as a [[suspect classification|classification]], like [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[gender]], and [[religion]], that should likewise draw extra [[Strict scrutiny|scrutiny]] from the courts in matters pertaining to [[civil rights]].&lt;ref name=Bazelon&gt;{{cite web

The theory was discussed in academia in the wake of ''[[Goldberg v. Kelly]]'', a 1970 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case, which decided that [[due process]], such as a notice and a [[fair hearing]], were required when dealing with the deprivation of a government benefit (such as a [[medical license]]) or an [[entitlement]] (such as [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare payments]]).&lt;ref name=Bazelon/&gt;  However, attempts to promote redistributive change through the courts gained no traction, and the result of ''Goldberg v. Kelly'' was, thus, limited in scope.&lt;ref name=Bazelon/&gt; 

One of the goals, in light of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', was to promote equality in [[Education in the United States|school funding]], but this was specifically rejected by the Supreme Court in ''[[San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez]]'' (1973), which ruled that there was no inherent [[right to education]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=Helfrich&gt;{{cite web

 |quote        = A classic example would be something like public education, where after Brown v. Board, a major issue ends up being redistribution -- how do we get more money into the schools, and how do we actually create equal schools and equal educational opportunity? Well, the court in a case called San Antonio v. Rodriguez in the early '70s basically slaps those kinds of claims down, and says, 'You know what, we as a court have no power to examine issues of redistribution and wealth inequalities. With respect to schools, that's not a race issue, that's a wealth issue and something we can't get into.'

'''SHYSTER''' is a [[legal expert system]] developed at the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]] in 1993.  It was written as the doctoral dissertation of [[James Popple]] under the supervision of Robin Stanton, Roger Clarke, [[Peter Drahos]], and Malcolm Newey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|type=PhD thesis|last=Popple|first=James|author-link=James Popple|title=SHYSTER: A Pragmatic Legal Expert System|year=1993|publisher=Australian National University|isbn=0-7315-1827-6|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~James.Popple/publications/theses/phd.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/SHYSTER-APragmaticLegalExpertSystem|archivedate=3 January 2007|deadurl=no|accessdate=10 August 2014}} Also {{Google books|jyQ2xnmAhXkC|available}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A full technical report of the expert system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popple|first=James|author-link=James Popple|title=SHYSTER: The Program|year=1993|publisher=Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, Australian National University|series=Technical Report TR-CS-93-13|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~James.Popple/publications/reports/tr-cs-93-13.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/SHYSTER-TheProgram|archivedate=3 January 2007|deadurl=no|accessdate=10 August 2014}} Also {{Google books|8PjkWBjFy4gC|available}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a book&lt;ref name="Popple"&gt;{{cite book|last=Popple|first=James|author-link=James Popple|title=A Pragmatic Legal Expert System|year=1996|publisher=Dartmouth (Ashgate)|series=Applied Legal Philosophy Series|isbn=1-85521-739-2|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~James.Popple/publications/books/shyster.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/APragmaticLegalExpertSystem|archivedate=28 December 2006|deadurl=no|accessdate=10 August 2014}} Also {{Google books|ZyfNAgAAQBAJ|available}}.&lt;/ref&gt; further detailing its development and testing have also been published.

SHYSTER emphasises its pragmatic approach, and posits that a legal expert system need not be based upon a complex model of legal reasoning in order to produce useful advice.  Although SHYSTER attempts to model the way in which lawyers argue with cases, it does not attempt to model the way in which lawyers decide which cases to use in those arguments.  SHYSTER is of a general design, permitting its operation in different legal domains.  It was designed to provide advice in areas of case law that have been specified by a legal expert using a bespoke [[specification language]].  Its knowledge of the law is acquired, and represented, as information about cases. It produces its advice by examining, and arguing about, the similarities and differences between cases.  It derives its name from [[Shyster]]: a slang word for someone who acts in a disreputable, unethical, or unscrupulous way, especially in the practice of law and politics.

==Methods==
SHYSTER is a specific example of a general category of legal expert systems, broadly defined as systems that make use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to solve legal problems.  [[Artificial intelligence and law|Legal AI]] systems can be divided into two categories: legal retrieval systems and legal analysis systems.  SHYSTER belongs to the latter category of legal analysis systems.  Legal analysis systems can be further subdivided into two categories: judgment machines and legal expert systems.  SHYSTER again belongs to the latter category of legal expert systems.  A [[legal expert system]], as Popple uses the term, is a system capable of performing at a level expected of a lawyer:  “AI systems which merely assist a lawyer in coming to legal conclusions or preparing legal arguments are not here considered to be legal expert systems; a legal expert system must exhibit some legal expertise itself."&lt;ref name="Popple"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

Designed to operate in more than one legal domain, and be of specific use to the common [[law of Australia]], SHYSTER accounts for [[statute law]], [[case law]], and the doctrine of [[precedent]] in areas of [[private law]].  Whilst it accommodates statute law, it is primarily a case-based system, in contradistinction to rule-based systems like [[MYCIN]].  More specifically, it was designed in a manner enabling it to be linked with a rule-based system to form a hybrid system.  Although case-based reasoning possesses an advantage over rule-based systems by the elimination of complex [[semantic network]]s, it suffers from intractable theoretical obstacles: without some further theory it cannot be predicted what features of a case will turn out to be relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Greinke, A. (1994): [http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v1n4/greinke14.txt ‘Legal Expert Systems: A Humanistic Critique of Mechanical Human Inference’] ''E-Law: Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law'' Volume 1, Number 4 (December 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  Users of SHYSTER therefore require some legal expertise.

[[Richard Susskind]] argues that “jurisprudence can and ought to supply the models of law and legal reasoning that are required for computerized [sic] implementation in the process of building all expert systems in law.”&lt;ref&gt;Susskind, R. (1987): ‘Expert Systems in Law’ (Oxford) p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Popple, however, believes [[jurisprudence]] is of limited value to developers of legal expert systems.  He posits that a lawyer must have a model of the law (maybe unarticulated) which includes assumptions about the nature of law and legal reasoning, but that model need not rest on basic philosophical foundations.  It may be a pragmatic model, developed through experience within the legal system. Many lawyers perform their work with little or no jurisprudential knowledge, and there is no evidence to suggest that they are worse, or better, at their jobs than lawyers well-versed in jurisprudence.  The fact that many lawyers have mastered the process of legal reasoning, without having been immersed in jurisprudence, suggests that it may indeed be possible to develop legal expert systems of good quality without jurisprudential insight.&lt;ref name="Popple"/&gt;{{rp|6–7}}  As a pragmatic legal expert system SHYSTER is the embodiment of this belief.

A further example of SHYSTER’s pragmatism is its simple [[knowledge representation]] structure.  This structure was designed to facilitate specification of different areas of case law using a specification language.  Areas of case law are specified in terms of the cases and attributes of importance in those areas.  SHYSTER weights its attributes and checks for dependence between them.  In order to choose cases upon which to construct its opinions, SHYSTER calculates distances between cases and uses these distances to determine which of the leading cases are nearest to the instant case.  To this end SHYSTER can be seen to adopt and expand upon [[nearest neighbor search]] methods used in [[pattern recognition]].  These nearest cases are used to produce an argument (based on similarities and differences between the cases) about the likely outcome in the instant case. This argument relies on the doctrine of precedent; it assumes that the instant case will be decided the same way as was the nearest case.  SHYSTER then uses information about these nearest cases to construct a report.  The report that SHYSTER generates makes a prediction and justifies that prediction by reference only to cases and their similarities and differences: the calculations that SHYSTER performs in coming to its opinion do not appear in that opinion.  Safeguards are employed to warn users if SHYSTER doubts the veracity of its advice.

==Results==
SHYSTER was tested in four different and disparate areas of case law.  Four specifications were written, each representing an area of Australian law: an aspect of the law of [[trover]]; the meaning of “authorization [sic]” in [[Australian copyright law]]; the categorisation of employment contracts; and the implication of [[natural justice]] in administrative decision-making.  SHYSTER was evaluated under five headings: its usefulness, its generality, the quality of its advice, its limitations, and possible enhancements that could be made to it.  Despite its simple knowledge representation structure, it has shown itself capable of producing good advice, and its simple structure has facilitated the specification of different areas of law.

Appreciating the difficulties encountered by legal expert systems developers in adequately representing legal knowledge can assist in appreciating the shortcomings of [[digital rights management]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, A. (2005): ‘Rights Expression on Digital Communication Networks: Some Implications for Copyright’ ''International Journal of Law and Information Technology'' 2005 13(1) p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some academics believe future digital rights management systems may become sophisticated enough to permit exceptions to copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g.: Maillard, T. (2004): ‘Towards Digital Rights and Exemptions Management Systems’ ''Computer law and Security Report ''20 (4), pp. 281–287.&lt;/ref&gt;  To this end SHYSTER's attempt to model “authorization [sic]” in the [[Australian Copyright Act 1968|Copyright Act]] can be viewed as pioneering work in this field.  The term “authorization [sic]” is undefined in the Copyright Act.  Consequently, a number of cases have been before the courts seeking answers as to what conduct amounts to authorisation.  The main contexts in which the issue has arisen are analogous to permitted exceptions to copyright currently prevented by most digital rights management technologies: “home taping of recorded materials, photocopying in educational institutions and performing works in public”.&lt;ref&gt;McKeough, J., Bowery, K. and Griffith, P. (2002): ‘Intellectual Property: Commentary and Materials’ (third edition), Lawbook Co. p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;  When applied to one case concerning [[compact cassette]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=CBS Songs v. Amstrad|court=UKHL|year=1988|num=15|date=12 May 1988|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; SHYSTER successfully agreed that Amstrad did not authorise the infringement.&lt;ref name="Popple"/&gt;{{rp|186}}

==SHYSTER-MYCIN==
Popple highlighted the most obvious avenue of future research using SHYSTER as the development of a rule-based system, and the linking together of that rule-based system with the existing case-based system to form a hybrid system.  This intention was eventually realised by Thomas O’Callaghan, the creator of SHYSTER-MYCIN: a hybrid legal expert system first presented at ICAIL '03, 24–28 June 2003 in Edinburgh, Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=O’Callaghan|first=Thomas A.|last2=Popple|first2=James|authorlink2=James Popple|last3=McCreath|first3=Eric|title=SHYSTER-MYCIN: A Hybrid Legal Expert System|date=26 June 2003|conference=Ninth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL-03)|publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]|place=Edinburgh, Scotland|pages=103-104|ISBN=1581137478|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/software/shyster/tom/icail-03.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=no|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MYCIN]] is an existing medical expert system, which was adapted for use with SHYSTER.  MYCIN’s controversial “certainty factor” is not used in SHYSTER-MYCIN.  The reason for this is the difficulty in scientifically establishing how certain a fact is in a legal domain.  The rule-based approach of the MYCIN part is used to reason with the provisions of an Act of Parliament only.&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan"&gt;{{cite book|last=O’Callaghan|first=Thomas A.|last2=McCreath|first2=Eric|last3=Popple|first3=James|authorlink3=James Popple|title=Building and Testing the SHYSTER-MYCIN Hybrid Legal Expert System|year=2003|publisher=Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, Australian National University|series=Technical Report TR-CS-03-01|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~James.Popple/publications/reports/tr-cs-03-01.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=no|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This hybrid system enables the case-based system (SHYSTER) to determine open textured concepts when required by the rule-based system (MYCIN).&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan"/&gt;{{rp|2}} The ultimate conclusion of this joint endeavour is that a hybrid approach is preferred in the creation of legal expert systems where “it is appropriate to use rule-based reasoning when dealing with statutes, and…case-based reasoning when dealing with cases”.&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan"/&gt;{{rp|13}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3566">A '''Supreme Court Clinic''' is a [[law school clinic]] that provides hands-on legal experience in [[Supreme Court Litigation]] to law students. Clinics are usually directed by clinical professors and experienced Supreme Court litigators and typically represent indigent or non-profit clients in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Assistance is provided [[pro bono]].

Supreme Court Clinics exist at Stanford Law School, New York University Law School, Yale Law School, Harvard Law School, The University of Virginia School of Law, The University of Texas School of Law, Emory University School of Law, George Mason University School of Law, Northwestern University Law School, Southwestern Law School, and University of Pennsylvania Law School. Supreme Court clinics generally file [[amicus briefs]] ("friend of the Court briefs"); petitions for [[certiorari]], which are formal requests to the Court to decide a case; and merits briefs, which are formal legal arguments presented to the Court after it as agreed to take a case. Typically, experienced Supreme Court litigators help run the clinics. It is these litigators who represent the clinics before the Court during oral arguments.

The first Supreme Court Clinic was founded at [[Stanford Law School]] in 2004 and, by March 2006, the Supreme Court had agreed to hear five cases the clinic helped file and declined to hear three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/15/education/15stanford.html?ex=1300078800&amp;en=166193a56fba80c8&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss | publisher=The New York Times | title=Stanford Law Students Get Early Supreme Court Duty | author=Falcone, Michael | date=March 15, 2006 | accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court Litigation Clinic at NYU School of Law was formed in Fall 2007. The Supreme Court Clinic at the [[University of Texas School of Law]] was formed in Fall 2006; the [[Yale Supreme Court Advocacy Clinic]] was formed in Fall 2006; and the [[University of Virginia School of Law|University of Virginia]] Supreme Court Litigation Clinic was formed in Fall 2006. Harvard Law School announced that it will launch a Supreme Court Clinic in Fall 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/2007/01/30_ussc.php | title=Harvard Law School to launch Supreme Court and Appellate Litigation Clinic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Pennsylvania opened its Supreme Court Clinic Fall 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.law.upenn.edu/clinic/scc/ | title=Penn Law Supreme Court Clinic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Emory Law School Supreme Court Advocacy Project]], the first largely student-run Supreme Court Clinic, started in Fall 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.emory.edu/about-emory-law/news-article/article/supreme-court-advocacy-project-receives-award-for-amicus-brief.html Supreme Court Advocacy Project Receives Award for Amicus Brief] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407014024/http://www.law.emory.edu/about-emory-law/news-article/article/supreme-court-advocacy-project-receives-award-for-amicus-brief.html |date=2012-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Supreme Court clinics have popped up at the law schools of UCLA, and West Virginia University.

'''Taxable Wages''', in [[payroll]], is the sum of all earnings by an employee that are eligible for a particular type of [[tax]]. Each tax is different and has different [[regulation]]s about limits to the amount of [[wage]]s that can be considered taxable with respect to that tax.

==Example==
A common example, the [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act]] (FUTA) tax in the [[United States]] had, in 2004, a taxable wage limit of $7,000. As described on the form which records information for this tax paid by employers, [[U.S. Internal Revenue Service]] form 940, only the first $7,000 of wages earned by each employee can be considered for the FUTA tax.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name || Wages || Taxable Wages
|-
| Joe Spittle || 8,500 || 7,000
|-
| Jeff Wrench || 4,000 || 4,000
|-
| Jane Lip || 500 || 500
|-
| Erica Derg || 4,500 || 4,500
|-
| colspan='2' | Total Taxable Wages: || 16,000
|}

In this example, Joe Spittle earns $8500. Since this is higher than the limit of FUTA for taxable wages, which is $7,000, the FUTA tax calculated for Joe cannot be calculated against any more than the limit of $7,000.

'''Threatening terrorism against the United States''' is a [[Classes of offenses under United States federal law|class C]] [[felony]] punishable by 10 years imprisonment under {{uscsub|18|2332b|c|1|g}}. The elements of the offense are that someone [[willfully]] threatens to commit a crime that will result in death or great bodily harm; the threat is made with the specific intent that it be taken as a threat; the threat is so unequivocal, unconditional, and specific as to convey a gravity of purpose and immediate prospect of execution; the threat actually causes fear in the victim; and the fear is reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Brent L.|title=Antiterrorism legislation in the United States: Problems and implications|journal=Terrorism|date=9 January 2008|volume=7|issue=2|pages=213-231|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10576108408435575?journalCode=uter19|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws governing such threats were passed after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. The law was amended by the Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S.735 - Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act of 2007|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-bill/735|website=Congress.gov|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leahy|first1=Patrick|title=The First Anniversary Of The Virginia Tech Tragedy|url=https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/the-first-anniversary-of-the-virginia-tech-tragedy|website=U.S. Senatory Patrick Leahy of Vermont|accessdate=14 December 2017|date=15 April 2008}} (Leahy says that the School Safety and Law Enforcement Improvement Act "clarifies and strengthens two existing statutes – the Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act and the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act...")&lt;/ref&gt; False information and hoaxes pertaining to attacks on U.S. officials, government buildings, airplanes, etc. are also punishable under {{usc|18|1038}} as a class D felony, which is punishable by 5 years imprisonment.

All [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] of the seven [[uniformed services of the United States]] swear or affirm an '''[[oath of office]]''' upon [[commissioned officer|commissioning]]. It differs slightly from that of the [[oath of enlistment]] that enlisted members recite when they enter the service. It is required by statute, the oath being prescribed by Section 3331, [[Title 5 of the United States Code|Title 5, United States Code]].&lt;ref name=USC10.3331 /&gt; It is traditional for officers to recite the oath upon promotion but as long as the officer's service is continuous this is not required.&lt;ref name=USC10.626&gt;{{usc|10|626}}, ''Acceptance of promotions; oath of office''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text of the Oath==

{{quotation|
I, [name], do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.&lt;ref name=USC10.3331&gt;{{usc|5|3331}}, ''Oath of Office''.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The oath is for an indeterminate period; no duration is specifically defined.

Officers of the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] of the various States, however, take an additional oath:

{{quotation|
I, ''[name]'', do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State (Commonwealth, District, Territory) of ___
against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the Governor of the State (Commonwealth, District, Territory) of ___, that I make this obligation freely, without any mental reservations or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the Office of ''[grade]'' in the Army/Air National Guard of the State (Commonwealth, District, Territory) of ___ on which I am about to enter, so help me God.&lt;ref&gt;National Guard Bureau Form 337 http://www.ngbpdc.ngb.army.mil/forms/ngbf337.htm "Oath of Enlistment". Accessed Jan 24 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Commissioned officers (O-1 (second lieutenant or ensign) through O-10 (general or admiral) and W-2 through W-5 (chief warrant officers)) are commissioned under the authority of the President of the United States with the advice and consent of the [[United States Senate]]; [[Warrant Officer (United States)|warrant officers]] (W-1) receive a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] under the authority of their respective service secretary (e.g., the [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] or the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]]); National Guard officers are additionally committed to the authority of the [[Governor (United States)|governor]] of their state. They may be activated in the service of their state in time of local or state emergency in addition to federal activation. Reserve officers may only be activated by the President of the United States.

== History ==
The first oaths of office were given to those serving under the [[Continental Army]], beginning in 1775.  A candidate had to not only name the 13 states, but also swear to keep them "free, independent and sovereign states and declare no allegiance to George the third, king of Great Britain” as well as “defend the United States against King George, his heirs and successors, and his and their abettors, assistants and adherents.”

It was first updated in September 1776, after the [[Declaration of Independence]], to swear to be “true to the United States of America, and to serve them honestly and faithfully against all their enemies opposers whatsoever; and to observe and obey the orders of the Continental Congress and the orders of the Generals and officers set over me by them.”

This was changed in 1789 to place allegiance to the [[Constitution of the United States]] at the beginning of the oath.  It would remain relatively unchanged until the 1860s.  At this point, the reference to "them" was replaced with "it" to reflect both the realities of the states divided during the [[American Civil War]] but also the shifting attitude of viewing the United States as one entity rather than a collection of smaller ones.

In 1884, it was simplified to having the candidate “solemnly swear (or affirm) to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign or domestic; to bear true faith and allegiance to the same; to take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and to well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.”

This would be the oath until 1959, when it found its current form.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=The Sextant|url=http://usnhistory.navylive.dodlive.mil/2014/09/17/227-years-of-military-oaths-to-support-and-defend-the-constitution/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vena Pointer''' (1880 &amp;ndash; 1971), was Colorado's first female water lawyer. She was born in Kansas and moved to Colorado in 1911 after she took a job working in George Wallis' law firm.&lt;ref name="wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coyotegulch.wordpress.com/2012/02/06/profile-vena-pointer-colorados-first-female-water-lawyer/|title=Profile: Vena Pointer — Colorado’s first female water lawyer|date=6 February 2012|website=Coyotegulch.wordpress.com|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout her career, Pointer worked as a prominent member of Colorado's water community and served as one of the original board members of the [[Colorado Water Conservation Board]] when it was founded in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2268&amp;dat=19480501&amp;id=2FJAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CQEGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1457,3328692|title=The Pueblo Indicator - Google News Archive Search|website=News.google.com|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Pointer was the last person in Colorado to be admitted to the bar under the practice of [[Law clerk|clerk]]ship. Clerkship was a system in which, a person would read the law, rather than attended law school, in preparation for admittance to the bar. Pointer read the law for seven years and passed her examination in 1926, making her Colorado's first female water lawyer. Following her admitance to the bar, Pointer worked with her law partner Fred Sabin in [[Pueblo, Colorado]] till his death in 1931.&lt;ref name="wordpress.com"/&gt;

Throughout her career, Pointer served as distinguished member of the Colorado water community. She served as the secretary of the Arkansas Valley Ditch Association from 1919&amp;ndash;1959.&lt;ref name="colostate.edu"&gt;[http://digitool.library.colostate.edu///exlibris/dtl/d3_1/apache_media/L2V4bGlicmlzL2R0bC9kM18xL2FwYWNoZV9tZWRpYS8zNDAwODQ=.pdf] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her career, Pointer worked on projects that attempted to solve and settle water disputes between Colorado and Kansas on the Arkansas River. In part, her work was central to development of the Arkansas River Compact. Signed in 1949 the Arkansas River Compact settled a number of disputes over water rights between Kansas and Colorado that had existed since 1901.

In part, her prominenence in Colorado water law led Governor [[Edwin C. Johnson]] to appoint Pointer to serve as a member of the 1933 Caddoa Commission. This commission was tasked with studying the feasibility of constructing a flood-control reservoir near the small town of [[Caddoa, Colorado]].&lt;ref name="colostate.edu"/&gt; The construction of the Caddoa dam and reservoir represented one way to develop new water supplies for the Arkansas River, while also providing flood and irrigation control to Kansas' water users. Construction on the dam began in 1940 and in the same year it was renamed the John Martin Reservoir, after Senator John A. Martin.&lt;ref name="colostate.edu"/&gt;
