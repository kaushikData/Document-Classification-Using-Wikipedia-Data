'''AP Physics C: Mechanics''' (often referred to as '''AP C Mechanics''', '''AP Mechanics''', or simply '''AP Physics C''') is an [[Advanced Placement]] [[science]] course that studies [[Newtonian mechanics]]. It is one of the [[AP Physics]] courses offered in some [[Secondary education in the United States|U.S. secondary schools]]. 

==Course content==
Intended to be equivalent to an introductory [[college]] course in mechanics for physics or engineering majors,&lt;ref name=PhysCMechoverview&gt;{{citation | url = http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-course-overviews/ap-physics-c-mechanics-course-overview.pdf | format = PDF | title = AP®  PHYSICS C: MECHANICS | publisher = [[College Board]] | date = December 2016 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the course modules are:&lt;ref name=PhysCMechoverview/&gt;
* Kinematics 
* Newton’s laws of motion 
* Work, energy and power 
* Systems of particles and linear momentum 
* Circular motion and rotation 
* Oscillations and gravitation.

Methods of [[calculus]] are used wherever appropriate in formulating physical principles and in applying them to physical problems. Therefore, students should have completed or be concurrently enrolled in a calculus class.&lt;ref name=PhysCMechoverview/&gt;

This course may be combined with [[AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism]] to make a unified Physics C course that prepares for both exams.

==AP test==

The course culminates in an optional exam for which high-performing students may receive some credit towards their college coursework, depending on which college or university they attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/creditandplacement | title = Credit &amp; Placement | work = AP Students | publisher = The [[College Board]] | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Registration===
The AP examination for AP Physics C: Mechanics is separate from the AP examination for AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism. Before 2006, test-takers paid only once and were given the choice of taking either one or two parts of the Physics C test.

===Format===
The exam is configured in two categories: a 35-question [[multiple choice]] section and a 3-question [[free response]] section.&lt;ref name=PhysCMechoverview/&gt;  Test takers are allowed to use an approved calculator during the entire exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-physics-c-mechanics/calculator-and-table-policies | title = AP Physics C: Mechanics – Calculator and Table Policies | work = AP Students | publisher = [[College Board]] | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test is weighted such that each section is worth fifty percent (50%) of the final score.&lt;ref name=PhysCMechoverview/&gt;  Additionally, tables of equations, information, and constants are provided for all portions of the exam as of 2015. This and [[AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism]] are the shortest AP exams, with total testing time of 90 minutes.&lt;ref name=PhysCMechoverview/&gt;

The topics covered by the exam are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/physics_c/topics.html | title = Topic Outline | work = College Board Tests | publisher = The College Board | year = 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130404054146/http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/physics_c/topics.html | archive-date = April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Accounting ethics''' is primarily a field of [[applied ethics]] and is part of [[business ethics]] and human [[ethics]], the study of [[moral value]]s and judgments as they apply to [[accountancy]]. It is an example of [[professional ethics]]. Accounting introduced by [[Luca Pacioli]], and later expanded by government groups, professional organizations, and independent companies. Ethics are taught in accounting courses at higher education institutions as well as by companies training [[accountant]]s and [[audit]]ors.

Due to the diverse range of accounting services and recent corporate collapses, attention has been drawn to ethical standards accepted within the accounting profession.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jackling|first=Beverly|author2=Barry J.

==Importance of ethics==
The nature of the work carried out by accountants and auditors requires a high level of ethics. Shareholders, potential shareholders, and other users of the financial statements rely heavily on the yearly financial statements of a company as they can use this information to make an informed decision about investment.&lt;ref name="FinReportShare"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=David|author2=Anne Britton|title=Financial Reporting|publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA|year=2004|page=160|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1OUTXGDWeWoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA160,M1|isbn=1-84480-033-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They rely on the opinion of the accountants who prepared the statements, as well as the auditors that verified it, to present a true and fair view of the company.&lt;ref name="AccAudRely"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dietz|first=David|title='Auditors Are Timid'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KesNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QHADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2763,4354640&amp;dq=investors+rely+on+accountants+auditors|date=April 26, 2002|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''|accessdate=May 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of ethics can help accountants and auditors to overcome ethical dilemmas, allowing for the right choice that, although it may not benefit the company, will benefit the public who relies on the accountant/auditor's reporting.&lt;ref name="AcctEthicsBook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Duska|first=Ronald F.|author2=Brenda Shay Duska|title=Accounting Ethics|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2003|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y4LgVJgynCsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+Accounting+Ethics|isbn=0-631-21651-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most countries have differing focuses on enforcing accounting laws. In Germany, accounting legislation is governed by "tax law"; in Sweden, by "accounting law"; and in the United Kingdom, by the "[[United Kingdom company law|company law]]". In addition, countries have their own organizations which regulate accounting. For example, Sweden has the Bokföringsnämden (BFN - Accounting Standards Board), Spain the Instituto de Comtabilidad y Auditoria de Cuentas (ICAC), and the United States the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB).&lt;ref name="EthicalIssuesAcct"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gowthorpe|first=Catherine|author2=John Blake|title=Ethical Issues in Accounting|year=1998|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=7|isbn=0-415-17173-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pacioli.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A painting of two men. The man at the center is looking off to his right while drawing a symbol with his right hand. His left hand is resting on a page in a book. He is wearing a robe with a hood. The man on the right is looking towards the front and is wearing a long-sleeve red shirt with a black jacket. Several writing utensils and books are on a table with a green tablecloth in the front of the image.|Luca Pacioli, here in [[Portrait of Luca Pacioli|a 1495 portrait by an unknown Renaissance artist]], wrote on accounting ethics in 1494.]]
[[Luca Pacioli]], the "Father of Accounting", wrote on accounting ethics in his first book {{lang|la|[[Summa de arithmetica|Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni, et proportionalita]]}}, published in 1494.&lt;ref name="PacioliEthics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=L.

These various groups have led accountants to follow several codes of ethics to perform their duties in a professional work environment. Accountants must follow the code of ethics set out by the professional body of which they are a member. United States accounting societies such as the [[Association of Government Accountants]], [[Institute of Internal Auditors]], and the National Association of Accountants all have codes of ethics, and many accountants are members of one or more of these societies.&lt;ref name="Loeb322"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loeb|first=Stephen E.|title=Teaching Students Accounting Ethics: Some Crucial Issues|journal=Issues in Accounting Education|volume=3|pages=316–329|date=Fall 1988|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=7569002&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=7&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, the American Association of Public Accountants (AAPA) was created; it was the first step in developing professionalism in the United States accounting industry.&lt;ref name="EvolutionEthics"&gt;{{cite book|last=Casler|first=Darwin J.|title=The Evolution of CPA Ethics: A Profile of Professionalization|publisher=[[Michigan State University]]|year=1964|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1905, the AAPA's first ethical codes were formulated to educate its members.&lt;ref name="CriticalPerspectives209"&gt;{{cite book|editor=J. Edward Ketz|title=Accounting Ethics: Critical Perspectives on Business and Management|last=Preston|first=Alistair M.|author2=David J. Cooper|author3= D. Paul Scarbrough|author4=Robert C.

As a result of discussions, a list of professional ethics was incorporated into the organization's bylaws. However, because membership to the organization was voluntary, the association could not require individuals to conform to the suggested behaviors.&lt;ref name="EvolutionEthics"/&gt; Other accounting organizations, such as the Illinois Institute of Accountants, also pursued discussion on the importance of ethics for the field.&lt;ref name="IllInsEthics"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bookkeepers Repel Inference That Their Own Employers Were Aimed At.|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/403309611.html?dids=403309611:403309611&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Feb+28%2C+1907&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=DISCUSS+ACCOUNTING+ETHICS.&amp;pqatl=google|format = Fee required|accessdate=December 14, 2010|date=February 28, 1907|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAPA was renamed several times throughout its history, before becoming the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) as it's named today. The AICPA developed five divisions of ethical principles that its members should follow: "independence, integrity, and objectivity"; "competence and technical standards"; "responsibilities to clients"; "responsibilities to colleagues"; as well as "other responsibilities and practices".&lt;ref name="Perceptions5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sellers|first=James H.|title=Accounting Student Perceptions of Business and Professional Ethics|publisher=[[University of Mississippi]]|year=1981|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these divisions provided guidelines on how a [[Certified Public Accountant]] (CPA) should act as a professional. Failure to comply with the guidelines could have caused an accountant to be barred from practicing. When developing the ethical principles, the AICPA also considered how the profession would be viewed by those outside of the accounting industry.&lt;ref name="Perceptions5"/&gt;

==Teaching ethics==
Courses on this subject have grown significantly in the last couple of decades.&lt;ref name="EthicsPays"/&gt; Teaching accountants about ethics can involve role playing, lectures, case studies, guest lectures, as well as other mediums.&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt; Recent studies indicate that nearly all accounting textbooks touch on ethics in some way.&lt;ref name="LoebResearch4"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loeb|first=Stephen E.|title=Issues Relating to Teaching Accounting Ethics: An 18 Year Retrospective|journal=Research and Professional Responsibility and Ethics in Accounting|volume=11|page=4|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bW5PXF3I0HwC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=%22accounting+ethics%22#PPA4,M1|isbn=978-0-7623-1367-9|accessdate=May 14, 2009|doi=10.1016/s1574-0765(06)11001-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the first United States center that focused on the study of ethics in the accounting profession opened at [[Binghamton University]].&lt;ref name="AnonCenterEthics"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anonymous|title=First Center to Study Accounting Ethics Opens|journal=Journal of Accountancy|volume=176|issue=4|page=19|date=October 1993|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=558663&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1999, several U.S. states began requiring ethics classes prior to taking the [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination|CPA exam]].&lt;ref name="LoebResearch4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpeasy.com/ethics-cpe-courses/index.aspx "State Regulatory Accounting Ethics"] retrieved April 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=35em|bgcolor=|quote='''Seven goals of accounting ethics education'''
*Relate accounting education to moral issues.
*Recognize issues in accounting that have ethical implications.
*Develop "a sense of moral obligation" or responsibility.
*Develop the abilities needed to deal with ethical conflicts or dilemmas.
*Learn to deal with the uncertainties of the accounting profession.
*"Set the stage for" a change in ethical behavior.
*Appreciate and understand the history and composition of all aspects of accounting ethics and their relationship to the general field of ethics. —Stephen E. Loeb&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt;}}

In 1988, Stephen E. Loeb proposed that accounting ethics education should include seven goals (adapted from a list by Daniel Callahan).&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt; To implement these goals, he pointed out that accounting ethics could be taught throughout accounting curriculum or in an individual class tailored to the subject. Requiring it be taught throughout the curriculum would necessitate all accounting teachers to have knowledge on the subject (which may require training). A single course has issues as to where to include the course in a student's education (for example, before preliminary accounting classes or near the end of a student's degree requirements), whether there is enough material to cover in a semester class, and whether most universities have room in a four-year curriculum for a single class on the subject.&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt;

==Accounting scandals==
{{main|Accounting scandals}}
Accounting ethics has been deemed difficult to control as accountants and auditors must consider the interest of the public (which relies on the information gathered in audits) while ensuring that they remained employed by the company they are auditing.&lt;ref name="Loeb322"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJWhatYouLike"&gt;{{cite news|last=Berton|first=Lee|title=Goal: Ethical Standards for Accounting Practices|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=27058245&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|date=May 24, 1984|publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]]''|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They must consider how to best apply accounting standards even when faced with issues that could cause a company to face a significant loss or even be discontinued. Due to several accounting scandals within the profession, critics of accountants have stated that when asked by a client "what does two plus two equal?" the accountant would be likely to respond "what would you like it to be?".&lt;ref name="WSJWhatYouLike"/&gt; This thought process along with other criticisms of the profession's issues with conflict of interest, have led to various increased standards of professionalism while stressing ethics in the work environment.

The role of accountants is critical to society. Accountants serve as financial reporters and
intermediaries in the capital markets and owe their primary obligation to the public interest. The
information they provide is crucial in aiding managers, investors and others in making critical economic
decisions. Accordingly, ethical improprieties by accountants can be detrimental to society, resulting in
distrust by the public and disruption of efficient capital market operations.

}}
From the 1980s to the present there have been multiple accounting scandals that were widely reported on by the media and resulted in fraud charges, bankruptcy protection requests, and the closure of companies and accounting firms. The scandals were the result of [[creative accounting]], misleading [[financial analysis]], as well as [[bribe]]ry. Various companies had issues with fraudulent accounting practices, including [[Nugan Hand Bank#Scandal and collapse|Nugan Hand Bank]], [[Phar-Mor#Bankruptcy|Phar-Mor]], [[WorldCom#Accounting scandals|WorldCom]], and [[American International Group#Accounting fraud claims|AIG]]. One of the most widely reported violation of accounting ethics involved [[Enron]], a multinational company, that for several years had not shown a true or fair view of their financial statements. Their auditor [[Arthur Andersen]], an accounting firm considered one of the "[[Big Four auditors|Big Five]]", signed off on the validity of the accounts despite the inaccuracies in the financial statements.&lt;ref name="AASignOff"&gt;{{cite news|title=Auditors: In the palm of the banks?|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article5580824.ece|date=January 25, 2009|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|accessdate=June 18, 2009 | location=London | first1=Iain | last1=Dey | first2=Dominic | last2=Rushe}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the unethical activities were reported, not only did Enron dissolve but Arthur Andersen also went out of business.

===Causes===
Fraudulent accounting can arise from a variety of issues. These problems usually come to light eventually and could ruin not only the company but also the auditors for not discovering or revealing the misstatements. Several studies have proposed that a firm's [[corporate culture]] as well as the values it stresses may negatively alter an accountant's behavior.&lt;ref name="ClikeTrust"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clikeman|first=Paul M.|title=Educating for the Public Trust|journal=The CPA Journal|volume=73|issue=8|page=80|date=August 2003|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=407305991&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|accessdate=April 7, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090511003019/http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=407305991&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD| archivedate= 11 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AppleClimate"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Appelbaum|first=Steven H.|author2=Kyle J Deguire |author3=Mathieu Lay|title=The Relationship of Ethical Climate to Deviant Workplace Behaviour|journal=Corporate Governance|volume=5|issue=4|pages=43–55|year=2005|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=914821791&amp;sid=5&amp;Fmt=4&amp;clientId=17862&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|format = Registration required|accessdate=April 8, 2009| doi=10.1108/14720700510616587}}&lt;/ref&gt; This environment could contribute to the degradation of ethical values that were learned from universities.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt;

Until 1977, ethics rules prevented accounting and auditing firms from advertising to clients. When the rules were lifted, spending by the largest CPA firms on advertisements rose from [[United States dollar|US$]]4 million in the 1980s to more than $100&amp;nbsp;million in the 2000s.&lt;ref name="CSTAdvertise"&gt;{{cite news|last=Berton|first=Lee|title=Advertising has hurt accounting's ethics: critics|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1464160.html|format = Registration required|date=May 24, 1984|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claimed that, by allowing the firms to advertise, the business side overstepped the professional side of the profession, which led to a conflict of interest. This focus allowed for occurrences of fraud, and caused the firms, according to Apj , "... to offer services that made them more consultants and business advisers than auditors."&lt;ref name="CSTAdvertise"/&gt; As accounting firms became less interested in the lower-paying audits due to more focus on higher earning services such as consulting, problems arose.&lt;ref name="WashPost1998"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crenshaw|first=Albert B.|author2=Brett D.

A 2007 article in ''Managerial Auditing Journal'' determined the top nine factors that contributed to ethical failures for accountants based on a survey of 66 members of the [[International Federation of Accountants]]. The factors include (in order of most significant): "self-interest, failure to maintain objectivity and independence, inappropriate professional judgment, lack of ethical sensitivity, improper leadership and ill-culture, failure to withstand advocacy threats, lack of competence, lack of organizational and peer support, and lack of professional body support."&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt; The main factor, self-interest, is the motivation by an accountant to act in his/her best interest or when facing a conflict of interest.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt; For example, if an auditor has an issue with an account he/she is auditing, but is receiving financial incentives to ignore these issues, the auditor may act unethically.

The [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) are standards and interpretations developed by the [[International Accounting Standards Board]], which are principle-based.&lt;ref name="WSJSwitch"&gt;{{cite news|last=Scannell|first=Kara|author2=Joanna Slater|title=SEC Moves To Pull Plug On U.S. Accounting Standards|url=http://s.wsj.net/article/SB121985665095476825.html?mod=fpa_whatsnews|date=August 28, 2008|publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]]''|accessdate=April 8, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090511112508/http://s.wsj.net/article/SB121985665095476825.html?mod=fpa_whatsnews| archivedate= 11 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; IFRS are used by over 115 countries or areas including the [[European Union]], Australia, and Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="IFRSList"&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of IFRSs by Jurisdiction|url=http://www.iasplus.com/country/useias.htm#totals|date=March 24, 2009|publisher=[[International Financial Reporting Standards|IAS]] |accessdate=April 8, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090512150619/http://www.iasplus.com/country/useias.htm| archivedate= 12 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] (GAAP), the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting, is largely rule-based.&lt;ref name="WSJSwitch"/&gt; Critics have stated that the rules-based GAAP is partly responsible for the number of scandals that the United States has suffered.&lt;ref name="BizJourBoil"/&gt; The principles-based approach to monitoring requires more professional judgment than the rules-based approach.&lt;ref name="BennettRules"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=907368 |last=Bennett |first=Bruce |author2=Michael Bradbury |author3=Helen Pragnell |title=Rules, Principles and Judgments in Accounting Standards |journal=Abacus |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=189–203 |year=2006 |format=Registration required |ssrn=907368 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6281.2006.00197.x |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511192601/http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=907368 |archivedate=11 May 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many stakeholders in many countries such as The United States who report several concerns in the usage of rules-based accounting. According to recent studies, many believe that the principles-based approach in financial reporting would not only improve but would also support an auditor upon dealing with client’s pressure. As a result, financial reports could be viewed with fairness and transparency. When the U.S. switched to International accounting standards, they are composed that this would bring change. However, as a new chairperson of the SEC takes over the system, the transition brings a stronger review about the pros and cons of rules- based accounting. While the move towards international standards progresses, there are small amount of research that examines the effect of principle- based standards in an auditor’s decision- making process. According to 114 auditing experts, most are willing to allow clients to manage their net income based on rules- based standards. These results offers insight to the SEC, IASB and FASB in weighing the arguments in the debate of principles- vs. rules based- accounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Segovia|first=Joann|title=Do Principles- vs. Rules-Based Standards Have a Differential Impact on U.S. Auditors' Decisions?|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1871151361&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=2&amp;clientId=31810&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFRS is based on "understandability, relevance, materiality, reliability, and comparability".&lt;ref name="RRCUMIFRS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tosen|first=Graeme|title=A Practical Guide to IFRS for Derivatives and Structured Finance|publisher=Euromoney Books|year=2006|page=134|url=https://books.google.com/?id=00Jco44doU0C&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=relevance,+reliability,+comparability,+understandability,+and+materiality+IFRS|isbn=1-84374-267-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since IFRS has not been adopted by all countries, these practices do not make the international standards viable in the world domain. In particular, the United States has not yet conformed and still uses GAAP which makes comparing principles and rules difficult. In August 2008, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) proposed that the United States switch from GAAP to IFRS, starting in 2014.&lt;ref name="WSJSwitch"/&gt;

===Responses to scandals===
Since the major accounting scandals, new reforms, regulations, and calls for increased higher education have been introduced to combat the dangers of unethical behavior.&lt;ref name="PerfReport17"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnsson|first=Hans|author2=Per Erik Kihlstedt|title=Performance-Based Reporting|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2005|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/?id=T2sIinuZlHIC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22accounting+ethics%22|isbn=0-471-73543-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By educating accountants on ethics before entering the workforce, such as through higher education or initial training at companies, it is believed it will help to improve the credibility of the accounting profession.&lt;ref name="DellaDifference"/&gt; Companies and accounting organizations have expanded their assistance with educators by providing education materials to assist professors in educating students.&lt;ref name="BizJourChampion"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mader|first=Becca|title=Enron case causes colleges to champion accounting ethics|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2002/05/06/focus1.html|date=May 3, 2002|publisher=''[[The Business Journal]]''|accessdate=April 8, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090523034641/http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2002/05/06/focus1.html| archivedate= 23 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New regulations in response to the scandals include the [[Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 2004]] in Australia as well as the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002, developed by the United States.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt; Sarbanes-Oxley limits the level of work which can be carried out by accounting firms. In addition, the Act put a limit on the fee which a firm can receive from one client as a percentage of their total fees. This ensures that companies are not wholly reliant on one firm for its income, in the hope that they do not need to act unethically to keep a steady income. The act also protects [[whistleblower]]s and requires senior management in public companies to sign off on the accuracy of its company's [[accounting records]]. In 2002, the five members of the [[Public Oversight Board]] (POB), which oversaw ethics within the accounting profession, resigned after critics deemed the board ineffective and the SEC proposed developing a new panel, the [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] (PCAOB).&lt;ref name="5PCAOB"&gt;{{cite news|last=Labaton|first=Stephen|title=Accounting Ethics Panel Members Resign, Rejecting Sec Chief's Plan|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YuwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=M3ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3645,467306&amp;dq=accounting+ethics|date=January 23, 2002|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''|accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PCAOB was developed through the Act, and replaced the POB.&lt;ref name="ManagerialAcctBook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilton|first=Ronald W.|title=Managerial Accounting: Creating Value in a Dynamic Business Environment|publisher=McGraw Hill/Irwin|location=Boston|edition=Sixth|year=2005|page=26|isbn=0-07-111314-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC) released a report entitled ''Rebuilding Public Confidence in Financial Reporting: An International Perspective''.&lt;ref name="IFARebuild"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crow |first=John |author2=Christian Aubin |author3=Olivia Kirtley |author4=Kosuke Nakahira |author5=Ian Ramsay |author6=Guylaine Saucier |author7=Graham Ward |title=Rebuilding Public Confidence in Financial Reporting: An International Perspective |url=http://www.ifac.org/Credibility/ViewPoints_PubDL.php?PubID=00061 |format=PDF |date=August 2003 |publisher=[[International Federation of Accountants]] |accessdate=April 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528233709/http://www.ifac.org/Credibility/ViewPoints_PubDL.php?PubID=00061 |archivedate=May 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By studying the international company collapses as a result of accounting issues, it determined areas for improvement within organizations as well as recommendations for companies to develop more effective ethics codes. The report also recommended that companies pursue options that would improve training and support so accountants could better handle ethical dilemmas.&lt;ref name="JackPercept"/&gt;
A collaborative effort by members of the international financial regulatory community led by [[Michel Prada]], Chairman of the French Financial Markets Authority, resulting in establishment of the [[Public Interest Oversight Board]] (PIOB) on 1 March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The PIOB provides oversight of the IFAC standards-setting boards: the [[International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board]] (IAASB), the [[International Accounting Education Standards Board]] (IAESB) and the [[International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants]] (IESBA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The most recent reform came into effect in July 2010 when President Obama signed "The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act". The act covers a broad range of changes. The highlights of the legislation are consumer protections with authority and independence, ends too big to fail bail outs, advance warning system, transparency and accountability for exotic instruments, executive compensation and corporate governance, protects investors, and enforces regulations on the books.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/070110_Dodd_Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_comprehensive_summary_Final.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710034423/http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/070110_Dodd_Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_comprehensive_summary_Final.pdf |date=2010-07-10 }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation also resulted in the Office of the Whistleblower, which was established to administer the SEC's whistleblower program. Congress authorized the SEC to provide monetary awards to whistleblowers who come forward with information that results in a minimum of a $1,000,000 sanction. The rewards are between 10% and 30% of the dollar amount collected.&lt;ref&gt;"Welcome to the Office of the Whistleblower." U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (Home Page). Web. 31 Oct. 2011. &lt;https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Whistleblowers help identify fraud and other unethical behaviors early on. The result is less harm to investors, quickly holding offenders responsible, and to maintain the integrity of the U.S. markets.

'''Elizabeth Adelaide Manning''' (1828 – 10 August 1905) was a British writer and editor. She championed [[kindergarten]]s. She was one of the first students to attend [[Girton College]]. Manning was active for the [[National Indian Association]] which championed education and the needs of women in India.

==Life==
Elizabeth Adelaide Manning was born in 1828. Her mother was Clarissa (born Palmer) and her father was the lawyer [[James Manning (lawyer)|James Manning]], who helped the [[Law Amendment Society]] decide to support changing the [[Married Women's Property Act 1870|law relating to married women's property]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Manning was a founder member of the [[National Froebel Foundation|London Froebel Society]] in 1874 with her cousin [[Caroline Bishop (kindergarten)|Caroline Bishop]]. Bishop was advising the [[London School Board]] on the use of [[Kindergarten]] methods and Manning presented a paper on the same subject to the Social Science Association. The following year the Froebel Society became national.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; She was one of the first students to attend [[Girton College]] after she sat the entrance exam. Her stepmother was briefly the first mistress.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

In February 1871 Manning and her stepmother started the London branch of the [[National Indian Association]].&lt;ref name=open&gt;[http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/content/elizabeth-adelaide-manning Elizabeth Adelaide Manning], Open University. Retrieved 25 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Her stepmother died the following month and Manning increasingly became the society's main proponent. She edited its magazine, whose title shifted from ''The Journal of the National Indian Association'' to ''The Indian Magazine'' in 1886, and then in 1891 ''The Indian Magazine and Review'', still under Manning's leadership.&lt;ref name=open/&gt;

In 1882 the NIA launched Medical Women for India, an initiative to train women doctors so that they could work in part on caring for women in India.  (See [[Zenana missions]].) The NIA also took an interest in students from India who were studying in Britain. Manning created a book of guidance called ''Handbook of information relating to university and professional studies etc. for Indian students in the United Kingdom''. Manning had an open house policy and she cared particularly for students from India. In 1888 [[Cornelia Sorabji]] contacted the NIA from India for assistance in completing university education.&lt;ref name=mary/&gt; This letter was championed by [[Mary Hobhouse (died 1905)|Mary Hobhouse]] and Manning contributed funds, as did [[Florence Nightingale]], Sir [[William Wedderburn]] and others.&lt;ref name=mary/&gt; Sorabji arrived in England in 1889 and stayed with Manning.&lt;ref name=mary/&gt; Sorabji was the first woman to complete a law degree at Oxford and she kept contact with the NIA during her career.&lt;ref name=mary&gt;[http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/taxonomy/term/343 Mary Hobhouse], Open University. Retrieved 26 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1904, Manning was awarded the [[Kaisar-i-Hind Medal]], first class, by the King for services to the [[British Raj]].&lt;ref name="Office1819"&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain. India Office|title=The India List and India Office List for ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b2NPAAAAMAAJ|year=1819|publisher=Harrison and Sons|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manning died in London in 1905.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Gillian Sutherland, "Manning, (Elizabeth) Adelaide (1828–1905)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2007 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48424, accessed 25 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=open/&gt;

==Legacy==
Manning left bequests to the NIA, The [[National Froebel Foundation|Froebel Society]], the [[Royal Free Hospital]] and [[Charles Voysey (theist)|Charles Voysey]]'s unorthodox church in Piccadilly.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; She left her medal and two thousand pounds (£2,000) to Girton College. A portrait of her (from a photograph) was given by Emily Davies to Girton College, and Manning also gave the college a portrait of her stepmother.&lt;ref name="Stephen2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Barbara|last=Stephen|title=Girton College 1869–1932|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZmebitQs_cC&amp;pg=PA186|date=17 June 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-01531-8|pages=186–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 Indian writer [[Sukumar Ray]] wrote home to his parents about the NIA, which he described as "'MissManning's Association".

'''Anti-schooling activism''' or '''radical education reform''' seeks to abolish [[compulsory education|compulsory schooling]] laws.

==Arguments==

===Teaching as political control===

A non-curriculum, non-instructional method of teaching was advocated by [[Neil Postman]] and Charles Weingartner in their book ''Teaching as a Subversive Activity''. In [[inquiry education]] students are encouraged to ask questions which are meaningful to them, and which do not necessarily have easy answers; teachers are encouraged to avoid giving answers.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil, and Weingartner, Charles (1969), Teaching as a Subversive Activity, Dell, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murray N. Rothbard]] argues that the history of the drive for [[compulsory schooling]] is not guided by altruism, but by a desire to coerce the population into a mold desired by "The Establishment".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}{{clarify|date=July 2017}}

[[John Caldwell Holt]] asserts that youths should have the right to control and direct their own learning, and that the current compulsory schooling system violates a basic fundamental right of humans: the right to decide what enters our minds. He thinks that freedom of learning is part of [[freedom of thought]], even more fundamental a human right than [[freedom of speech]]. He especially states that forced schooling, regardless of whether the student is learning anything whatsoever, or if the student could more effectively learn elsewhere in different ways, is a gross violation of civil liberties (Holt, 1974).

[[Nathaniel Branden]] adduces government should not be permitted to remove children forcibly from their homes, with or without the parents' consent, and subject the children to educational training and procedures of which the parents may or may not approve. He also claims that citizens should not have their wealth expropriated to support an educational system which they may or may not sanction, and to pay for the education of children who are not their own. He claims this must be true for anyone who understands and is consistently committed to the principle of [[individual rights]]. He asserts that the disgracefully low level of education in America today is the predictable result of a state-controlled school system, and that the solution is to bring the field of education into the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Branden, N. (1963). Public Education, Should Education be Compulsory and Tax Supported, as it is Today? Chapter 5, Common Fallacies About Capitalism, [[Ayn Rand]], [[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The corruption of children – Rousseau===
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] wrote in his book ''[[Emile: or, On Education]]'' that all children are perfectly designed organisms, ready to learn from their surroundings so as to grow into virtuous adults, but due to the malign influence of corrupt society, they often fail to do so. Rousseau advocated an educational method which consisted of removing the child from society—for example, to a country home—and alternately conditioning him through changes to environment and setting traps and puzzles for him to solve or overcome.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Rousseau was unusual in that he recognized and addressed the potential of a problem of legitimation for teaching. He advocated that adults always be truthful with children, and in particular that they never hide the fact that the basis for their authority in teaching was purely one of physical coercion: "I'm bigger than you." Once children reached the age of reason, at about 12, they would be engaged as free individuals in the ongoing process of their own.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Grading – Illich===
In ''[[Deschooling Society]]'', [[Ivan Illich]] calls for the disestablishment of schools. He claims that schooling confuses teaching with learning, grades with education, diplomas with competence, attendance with attainment, and, especially, process with substance. He writes that schools do not reward real achievement, only processes. Schools inhibit a person’s will and ability to self-learn, ultimately resulting in psychological impotence. He claims that forced schooling perverts the victims’ natural inclination to grow and learn and replaces it with the demand for instruction. Further, the current model of schooling, replete with credentials, betrays the value of a self-taught individual. Moreover, institutionalized schooling seeks to quantify the unquantifiable – human growth.

=== Effects on local culture and economics  ===
In some cases schooling has been used as a tool for assimilation and a both deliberate and inadvertent tool to change local culture and economics into another form. Opponents of this effect argue it is a human right for a culture to be maintained, and education can violate this human right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/66455/|title=Indigenous education and human rights|last=Noam|first=Schimmel,|date=2007-01-01|website=eprints.lse.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Forced schooling has been used to forcibly assimilate Native Americans in the [[American Indian boarding schools|United States]] and [[Canadian Indian residential school system|Canada]], which some have said is [[cultural genocide]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/03/world/americas/canadas-forced-schooling-of-aboriginal-children-was-cultural-genocide-report-finds.html|title=Canada’s Forced Schooling of Aboriginal Children Was ‘Cultural Genocide,’ Report Finds|last=Austen|first=Ian|date=2015-06-02|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/planyourvisit/pdf/aibscurrguide.pdf|title=American Indian Boarding Schools: An Exploration of Global Ethnic &amp; Cultural Cleansing|last=Jones|first=Jennifer|last2=Bosworth|first2=Dee Ann|date=2011|website=|publisher=Ziibiwing Center of Anishinabe Culture &amp; Lifeways|access-date=|last3=Lonetree|first3=Amy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many psychologists believe the forced assimilation of native cultures has contributed to their high suicide rates and poverty.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb07/astruggle.aspx|title='A struggle for hope'|website=apa.org|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Western education encourages Western modes of survival and economic systems, which can be worse and poorer than the existing modes of survival and economic systems of an existing culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.webster.edu/corbetre/philosophy/education/bg/bg-ch-5.html|title=Philosophy of Education -- From: Chapter 5: Schooling in Capitalist America|website=faculty.webster.edu|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eco-action.org/dt/affluent.html|title=neolithic hunter-gatherers: Marshall Sahlins- The Original Affluent  Society|website=www.eco-action.org|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== School related stress and depression ===

=== Ineffective or counter to its purpose ===
Some of the proposed purposes of western style compulsory education are to prepare students to join the adult workforce and be financially successful, have students learn useful skills and knowledge, and prepare students to make positive economic or scientific contributions to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/newsletters/education-update/jul12/vol54/num07/What-Is-the-Purpose-of-Education%C2%A2.aspx|title=Education Update:Quality Feedback:What Is the Purpose of Education?|last=ASCD|website=www.ascd.org|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sec-ed.co.uk/best-practice/what-is-the-purpose-of-education/|title=What is the purpose of education?|website=www.sec-ed.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of schooling say it is ineffective at achieving these purposes and goals. In many countries, schools do not keep up with the skills demanded by the workplace, or never have taught relevant skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11988756/Schools-failing-to-prepare-young-people-for-work-say-business-leaders.html|title=Schools 'failing to prepare young people for work', say business leaders|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/schools-are-too-focused-on-exam-results-and-dont-prepare-students-for-the-workplace-survey-finds-10469021.html|title=Schools 'are not preparing students for the workplace'|date=2015-08-24|newspaper=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20130917/50294|title='Education inflation' hurts Swedes' job prospects|date=2013-09-17|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/09/03/robert_reich_college_is_a_ludicrous_waste_of_money_partner/|title=Robert Reich: College is a ludicrous waste of money|last=Reich|first=Robert|website=Salon|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students often feel unprepared for college as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edsource.org/2015/survey-most-high-school-students-feel-unprepared-for-college-careers/83752|title=Survey: Most high school students feel unprepared for college, careers|website=EdSource|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More schooling does not necessarily correlate with greater economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://educationnext.org/education-and-economic-growth/|title=Education and Economic Growth - Education Next|date=2008-02-29|newspaper=Education Next|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternate forms of schooling, such as the [[Sudbury school|Sudbury model]], have been shown to be sufficient for college acceptance and other western cultural goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sudval.org/05_alumni.html|title=Sudbury Valley School • Online Library.

Instead of being a way out of poverty and a way to stay away from crime, for many, school has the opposite effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1813">'''Associate Teacher Learning and Skills''' (ATLS) status is a designation awarded to teachers in the [[Further Education]] and Post-Compulsory Education &amp; Training sectors by the Education &amp; Training Foundation (ETF) in the [[United Kingdom]]. ATLS may be earned en route to [[Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills]] (QTLS) status, which is seen as on an equal level to [[Qualified Teacher Status]] (QTS).

ATLS is a professional 'status'.

==Gaining ATLS==

From November 2014, ATLS has been offered by the Education &amp; Training Foundation (ETF) to members of the Society for Education &amp; Training (SET) for a fee of £485. In order to obtain ATLS, the candidate is required to register with SET, undertake Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and complete SET's 'Professional Formation' process.

Prior to November 2014, ATLS was offered by the [[Institute for Learning]] (IfL) which was absorbed into the Education &amp; Training Foundation (ETF) on 31 October 2014.

ATLS can be obtained en route to [[Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills|QTLS]] which is seen as on an equal level to [[Qualified Teacher Status|QTS]].  Should an individual want to work as an Associate Teacher in maintained schools, the same way as any other teacher, then they must have ATLS and be a member of the Society for Education &amp; Training (SET).

The [[Certificate in Education and Training]] qualification and its predecessors (e.g. [[CTLLS]]) qualify a teacher to attain ATLS.

'''Australia ICOMOS''' is the peak cultural heritage conservation body in Australia. It is a branch of the United Nations-sponsored [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] (ICOMOS), a non-government professional organisation promoting expertise in the conservation of cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=PlanAust&gt;Susan Thompson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cE37xlhiF1cC ''Planning Australia: An Overview of Urban and Regional Planning''] (Cambridge University Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Its secretariat is based at the [[Cultural Heritage Centre for Asia and the Pacific]] at [[Deakin University]].

==Formation and role==

Australia ICOMOS was formed in 1976 and is one of over 100 current ICOMOS national committees. ICOMOS was formed in 1965 to advise [[UNESCO]] in the assessment of sites proposed for the [[World Heritage List]]. Membership of Australia ICOMOS comprises over 650 members, managed by an Executive Committee of 15 people who are elected from the membership. Several Australia ICOMOS members are also represented on various ICOMOS [[International Council on Monuments and Sites#International committees|International Scientific Committees]], and expert committees and boards in Australia.&lt;ref name=AI&gt;[http://australia.icomos.org/about-us/australia-icomos/mission-statement/ Australia ICOMOS Website]&lt;/ref&gt; It plays an important role in co-ordinating advocacy activities to raise the profile of Australia's cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.au/Assets/1176/1/AustralianHeritagePartnership-3August20111.pdf National Trust Australia, Media Release 3 August 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618020304/http://www.nationaltrust.org.au/Assets/1176/1/AustralianHeritagePartnership-3August20111.pdf |date=18 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first meeting which led to the formation of Australia ICOMOS was in Melbourne on 20 October 1976, and the first ICOMOS conference was in Beechworth in 1978, where they devised a committee to work up a local version of the [[Venice Charter]]. The actual ICOMOS meeting where the committee's draft was provisionally endorsed was in the town of [[Burra, South Australia|Burra]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=PlanAust/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.icomos.org/publications/charters/ Australia ICOMOS &gt; The Burra Charter] Full text of the 1999 revised version of the Burra Charter. Retrieved 16 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AI/&gt; Australia ICOMOS played the pivotal role in developing and [[Burra Charter]], regarded as the best-practice standard for cultural heritage management in Australia, which has influenced subsequent heritage legislation and conservation guidelines and practices in Australia.&lt;ref name=PlanAust/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marta De la Torre, Getty Conservation Institute, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pj24e6iE7DoC ''Heritage Values in Site Management: Four Case Studies''] (Getty Publications, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia ICOMOS has also been responsible for producing the Australia [[State of the Environment]] Report (SoE), to advise the Minister for Environment on ''...the current condition of the Australian environment, the pressures on it and the drivers of those pressures.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2011/report/heritage/pubs/soe2011-supplementary-heritage-icomos-workshop-notes.pdf Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Australia ICOMOS State of the environment 2011 workshop, summary notes DECEMBER 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022175529/http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2011/report/heritage/pubs/soe2011-supplementary-heritage-icomos-workshop-notes.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia ICOMOS also organises an annual national conference on themes relevant to conservation and heritage in Australia and South East Asia, often on a specific heritage and conservation theme for example on the Australian Capital city's 100th anniversary in 2012.&lt;ref name="canberra100.com.au"&gt;[http://www.canberra100.com.au/calendar/view/1942/icomos-national-conference-imagined-pasts-imagined-future/ ICOMOS National Conference, 'Imagined Pasts, Imagined Futures']&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent collaboration between the Chinese government, the Getty Conservation Institute and Australia ICOMOS has seen the export of Australian conservation expertise in developing '''China Principles''', ''...the Middle Kingdom's statement of conservation philosophy and method that is based on Australia's highly regarded Burra Charter''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/selling-heritage-to-china/story-e6frg8n6-1226067465487#sthash.HZJLffKT.dpuf Robert Bevan, 'Selling heritage to China' ''The Australian'' June 02, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Australia ICOMOS and the Burra Charter have also been held up as a world standard in Malta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20051218/opinion/conserving-local-heritage-through-heritage-management.68715 Samantha Fabry' Conserving local heritage through heritage management ''Times of Malta'' December 18, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Automated Weather Source''' ('''AWS''') was a [[partnership]] and later a [[corporation]] founded in 1992 by James Michael “Mike” Bailey and [[Topper Shutt|Charles “Topper” Shutt]] of [[Montgomery County, Maryland]],  whose purpose was to create a network of [[weather stations]] located at public schools and recreational facilities throughout the [[Mid-Atlantic region]] of the United States.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;McManus, Kevin. "A Bright Forecast for a New Venture." The Washington Post 24 November 1994: Style Plus.&lt;/ref&gt;

The weather data generated was accessed by [[dialup|dialup modem]] and included wind speed, wind direction, [[barometric pressure]], temperature, and rainfall totals, along with daily minimum and maximum values of each.  The network of primarily school-based weather stations became the first to generate real-time meteorological data for use on broadcast television when the AWS network was first referenced on September 11, 1992 during the nightly newscast of [[WUSA-TV]] (Channel 9) in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;Cyr, Emily. Topper Shutt | Chief Meteorologist | wusa9.com. 23 February 2011. 31 May 2011 &lt;http://www.wusa9.com/life/company/article/137330/153/Topper-Shutt--Chief-Meteorologist&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522071650/http://www.wusa9.com/life/company/article/137330/153/Topper-Shutt--Chief-Meteorologist |date=May 22, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AWS concept encouraged academic and recreational institutions to increase localized community awareness by soliciting donors to help them join the network.  A computer and software interfaced to the weather station, provided access to each site, and enabled the user to download near real-time and archived surface [[weather observations]]. The meteorological data were then used in the classroom as part of multiple curricula. The real time data was shared with the general public on broadcast media and provided to the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) for internal use and eventual integration into AFOS  ('''A'''utomation of '''F'''ield '''O'''perations and '''S'''ervices), the computer system in place at the time linking NWS offices for the transmission of weather data now known as [[AWIPS]]. Headquartered in [[Darnestown, Maryland]], the Automated Weather Source partnership formed in 1992 was incorporated in January 1994. Implementations of AWS’ core concept, often referred to as “SchoolNet” or “WeatherNet,” then began to expand into many other major US television markets over the course of the 1990s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pFeaoY44Mk Automated Weather Source Network Demo].

Topper Shutt and WUSA-TV 9. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Initial AWS methodology ===

Prior to the formation of the AWS partnership formed in 1992 by founders Bailey and Shutt, Bailey, an amateur weather enthusiast, worked with [[meteorologist]] Andrew Stern, then lead forecaster at the [[National Weather Service Baltimore/Washington|Sterling, Virginia National Weather Service forecast office]].  Stern and Bailey initially compiled code to access and download observations via dialup phone modem from a [[Heathkit|HeathKit]] 5001 weather station.  In an effort to access the data more efficiently, Bailey acquired a weather station produced by Texas Weather Instruments (TWI) that allowed direct access to the weather data. The TWI instrument, known as a Weather Report, became one of the first sources for local, hourly weather observations by a non-standard weather data platform to be accessed by the National Weather Service (NWS) and ingested into AFOS in the Washington, D.C. area.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

=== Creation of AWS network ===

As a NWS [[storm spotter]], and having previously worked as an intern and weather watcher for [[WRC-TV]],&lt;ref&gt;Girard, Keith F. "Storm Spotters Keep Eyes on Skies." The Washington Post 9 May 1985: MD1.&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey recognized the importance of localized weather data for on-air TV use. He provided Shutt with access to the weather data engine and began discussions on how and where other similar weather stations might be deployed and used in nightly local weather broadcasts. Locations considered included ski resorts and parks.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  Shutt suggested placement at schools, as they were at the time beginning to acquire computers and dedicated phone lines for access to remote data sources. Subsequently, Shutt and Bailey formed the Automated Weather Source Partnership, funding the purchase and donation of three weather stations to Washington-area schools to seed what became the nation’s first public school network of weather stations to generate weather data for use on broadcast TV at WUSA-TV.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  On September 11, 1992, Automated Weather Source Network became an on-air reality and its use quickly grew in the nation’s 8th largest TV market [[Designated Market Area|DMA]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

=== Network growth ===

Within a year [[Montgomery County Public Schools (Maryland)|Montgomery]], [[Fairfax County Public Schools|Fairfax]], [[Howard County Public School System|Howard]] and [[Loudoun County Public Schools|Loudoun]] County Public Schools were the first of the local technology and transportation coordinators that joined the AWS network as it grew to over thirty sites in the Washington area.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  The Automated Weather Source Network segment was self-promoting on air and became a community outreach tool for WUSA-TV 9.  [[Wisp Ski Resort|Wisp Resort]], in [[Garrett County, Maryland]], was the first ski area to purchase a unit and dedicate a phone line for access. Other Mid-Atlantic ski resorts followed suit as “Ski-net” evolved.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;   [[Stevenson screen|Stevenson shelters]] were built and used to house the outdoor sensors on the roofs of existing sites that appeared in the Automated Weather Source Network television segment. The AWS network had grown to 30 sites as the data sets generated were also used to provide near real-time observations from school rooftops.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;   AWS agreed to provide NWS access to the data from the network on an hourly basis for integration into the AFOS computer system.
Data from each AWS station was compiled and transcribed in [[ASCII|ASCII format]] . A typical observation would output to file as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Texas Weather Instruments. "Downloads -- Weather Instruments by Texas Weather Instruments, Inc." 27 September 2001. Texas Weather Instruments, Inc. 29 May 2011 &lt;{{cite web|url=http://www.txwx.com/ftp.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717121714/http://txwx.com/ftp.html |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

5:15 07/24/90 SSE 04 MPH 052F 069F 078F 099% 30.04R 00.19”D 01.38”M 11.78”T

The code written to interpret the TWI observation was ingested into AFOS, a system that has since transitioned to [[AWIPS]], a more modern interface used to interpret the same meteorological data. An early data set example read as follows, with a four-letter identifier followed by city, state and county:&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

DTWN DARNESTOWN MD MG 5:15 07/24/90 SSE 04 MPH 052F 069F 072F 099% 30.04R 00.19”D 01.38”M 11.78”T

The above data set, as a weather observation, would read as follows: “At 5:15 A.M. on July 24, 1990, the temperature at the Darnestown AWS site in Montgomery County, Maryland was 52° Fahrenheit, with 99% relative humidity and a wind from the south-southeast at four miles per hour.”

=== AWS data as a teaching tool and TV broadcast use ===
==== Social impact ====

Prior to the rapid growth of the Internet in 1992, primary media sources included print, radio, and broadcast TV.  Computer science had just begun its integration into K-12 schools in major metropolitan areas. The use of computers and dial-up modems with access to digitized resources was in its infancy at the time of AWS’ founding. A weather station as an engine that provided real-world data could then be integrated into each area of school curricula. Promoting such a concept by recognizing specific schools or locations on broadcast TV helped instill local civic pride.  The near real-time observations used by TV broadcast media made viewers more aware of the weather conditions where they worked and lived. Television networks’ use of the [[meteorological]] observations encouraged the growth of the AWS concept and the participation of local businesses in the growing effort to donate resources to help facilitate this cause.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

As the [[Washington, D.C.]] metro area school systems bought into the concept, AWS began working on a way to better archive and manipulate the data generated for use as a teaching tool for computer science, mathematics, geography, and science. Students would log observations and then plot them on a local map, and a series of manually logged observations would be graphed as well.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;   Eventually, an AWS subcontractor wrote a program that would automatically access the existing sites and download data for current observations as well as limited historical data. The program, which ran on desktop computers outfitted with 386 processors, then created graphs of historical data.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hotchkiss, Mari R. "Company Paves Meteorological Information Highway." Computer Digest (1994): Vol. 9 No. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criticisms and acceptance ====

AWS’ founders and employees chose school rooftops to place their weather stations because of such locations’ accessibility, security, proximity to electrical power and ease of maintenance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  The standard location for most sensor suites at that time was at airports, in the middle of large fields, or between runways with no physical obstructions that might disturb the immediate environment.&lt;ref&gt;National Weather Service. JetStream -- Automated Surface Observing Systems. n.d. 31 May 2011 &lt;http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/remote/asos.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Meteorologists both in the NWS and the private sector expressed concern that AWS sites might be subject to a number of confounds, such as the skewing of wind direction by rooftop structures, the heat retained on dark rooftop surfaces, and the hot exhaust from rooftop air conditioning units, all of which were thought to cause inaccuracies in the data.&lt;ref&gt;Leffler, R.J. and J.W. Schiesl. "Issues Concerning the Interpretation of Non-Standard Temperature Observations by National Weather Service Forecast Offices." National Weather Service (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, S.J. and K.G. Hubbard. "Nonfederal Automated Weather Stations and Networks in the United States and Canada: a Preliminary Survey." American Meteorological Society (1992): 449-457.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these concerns, meteorologists used AWS data to assist in the study of various weather phenomena, including the [[heat island effect]]. One such study, presented to the [[American Meteorological Society]] by Davey ''et al.'' of Colorado State University, cited examples and placement of multiple AWS network sites.&lt;ref&gt;Davey, Christopher A., et al. "Differences Between Rooftop and Ground-Based Surface Temperatures." 6th Symposium on Integrated Observing Systems, 82nd AMS Annual Meeting. Orlando: Colorado State University, 2002. 6.2.&lt;/ref&gt;
Each [[mesonet]] site was subject to environmental factors which differed from the official configuration of an NWS-certified [[Automated airport weather station#Automated Surface Observing System .28ASOS.29|ASOS]] weather station. As rooftop weather station configurations grew more widely available, however, rooftop observations became an accepted measure of meteorological data dissemination in the scientific community, with an understanding that the sites were considered nonstandard configurations. Armed with the metadata that highlighted the biases in rooftop observations, meteorologists used rooftop data in their forecasts at their own professional discretion.

=== Steps toward incorporation ===

The WUSA-TV Automated Weather Source Network on-air segment soon attracted the attention of Bill Mengel, then founder and owner of [[EAI Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;EAI Corporation. Dossier: EAI Info. 18 March 1997. 29 May 2011 &lt;https://web.archive.org/web/19970414235957/http://eaicorp.com/dossier.html%3E.&lt;/ref&gt;  EAI products included the manufacturing of air sensors for commercial and military use. Mengel sent then-EAI employee Robert “Bob” Marshall to meet with AWS founders Shutt and Bailey to discuss the possibility of manufacturing a more sophisticated weather station.  EAI’s background in air monitoring equipment, along with the engineering background of Marshall and Christopher Sloop, an engineer and computer programmer at EAI, brought a valuable skill set to the partnership. The discussions led to the development of a prototype of the first AWS-manufactured weather station and data display unit as well as the development of refined software needed to access and utilize the AWS network in schools and on-the-air.&lt;ref&gt;Earth Networks, Inc. Weather Station -- Earth Networks. 2011. 31 May 2011 &lt;http://weather.weatherbug.com/weatherbug-professional/products/weather-station&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== AWS Incorporated ==

Within 4 months of partnering with Mengel and EAI, the Automated Weather Source Partnership converted to a corporation . Its principal owners included Topper Shutt, Mike Bailey, Bill Mengel, Bob Marshall and Chris Sloop. Its main office was located in [[Germantown, Maryland]].  The hardware and software development took place in both Germantown and [[Abingdon, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7RO1J5WgMc Automated Weather Source WBAL Promo.] Dir.

==History==

===Early history===
====CourseInfo LLC====
[[CourseInfo]] was founded in late 1996 as a cutting edge [[Software as a service|software provider]] founded by [[Cornell University]] students [[Stephen Gilfus]] and [[Daniel Cane]].&lt;ref name=Nagler97-cornell&gt;{{cite news |title=Senior's company helps to produce Web pages for college courses |author=Michelle Nagler |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/10/seniors-company-helps-produce-web-pages-college-courses |work=[[Cornell Chronicle]] |date=October 16, 1997 |accessdate=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilfus wrote the business plan for CourseInfo and its Interactive Learning Network product while an undergraduate at Cornell. CourseInfo (a dorm room start up) with Gilfus as the business lead and Cane as the lead developer had developed an innovative new platform for internet and networked learning called a "Course Management System" by Gilfus.

The product was initially sold to schools on an annual FTE licensing model - full school deployment enterprise model.

====Blackboard LLC====
Blackboard LLC. was founded in 1997 by [[Michael Chasen]] and [[Matthew Pittinsky]] and began as a consulting firm contracting to the non-profit [[IMS Global Learning Consortium]] developing a prototype for online learning and thinking through online learning standardization.&lt;ref name=LSE&gt;{{cite news |title=GEO Interactive Re OEM Agreement |url= |newspaper=London Stock Exchange Aggregated Regulatory News Service |date=October 21, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chasen and Pittinsky started Blackboard after leaving [[KPMG|KPMG Consulting]] where they both had worked as part of the company's higher education practice.&lt;ref name="Leibovich"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Darcy2009&gt;{{cite news |title=Years at Blackboard an education that turns employees into entrepreneurs |author=Darlene Darcy |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2009/08/03/story2.html?page=all |work=[[American City Business Journals|Washington D.C.

====Blackboard Inc.====
In 1998, after Cane met Chasen at a conference on adaptive learning, Gilfus and Cane decided to merge CourseInfo LLC. with Chasen and Pittinky's Blackboard LLC. company in order to raise money and scale the business. The combined company became a corporation known as Blackboard Inc. They renamed the CourseInfo platform built by the Cornell team to Blackboard's CourseInfo; the CourseInfo brand was dropped in 2000.&lt;ref name=Leibovich&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackboard Chalks Up a Breakthrough; Its Educational Software Lets Colleges Put Classes on the Internet |first=Mark |last= Leibovich|url= |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=January 4, 1999 |page=F05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Educational&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackboard Aims For Standard With Building Blocks Initiative |magazine=Educational Marketer |date=November 20, 2000 |volume=31 |issue=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an extension of CourseInfo's original two weeks for free courses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Stephen |last= Gilfus |url= http://listserv.aera.net/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind9711&amp;L=aera-k&amp;P=8188 |title= Evaluation and Employment Opportunity |publisher=LISTSERV 16.0 |via= AERA-K Archives |date= November 21, 1997 |accessdate= February 20, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150220130215/http://listserv.aera.net/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind9711&amp;L=aera-k&amp;P=8188 |archive-date=February 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the company provided a hosted version "CourseSites" for teachers to try out for free.&lt;ref name=Burn06&gt;{{cite news |title=Agent of Change: Blackboard CEO Michael Chasen erases the old way of learning |author=Timothy Burn |url=http://www.smartceo.com/sites/default/files/May06.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622164812/http://www.smartceo.com/sites/default/files/May06.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2018-06-22 |work=SmartCEO |date=May 2006 |accessdate=May 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After having raised its seed round, the new company made a profit in its first year, and its sales in 1998 approached US$1 million.&lt;ref name="Leibovich"/&gt; Other early products included Blackboard Classroom and Blackboard Campus both derivatives of the original platform.&lt;ref name=Kelleher11&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackboard Founders’ Roots at American University |author=Anne Kelleher |url=http://www.american.edu/americantoday/campus-news/20110701-Blackboard-Pittinsky-Chasen.cfm |work=American Today |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Blackboard acquired iCollege/College Enterprises Inc.'s campus card, introducing commerce capability to Blackboard's portfolio.

By 2006, the firm's learning platform software was used in more than 40% of U.S. college campuses and the company had gained a significant worldwide market share.&lt;ref name=Burn&gt;{{cite news |title=Michael Chasen: CEO of the Year |first=Timothy |last=Burn |magazine=Washington Smart CEO |date = May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expansion was initially funded through venture capital from a number of investors, including [[Pearson PLC]], [[Dell]], [[AOL]], [[Carlyle Group|The Carlyle Group]] and Novak Biddle Venture Partners. At this time the company renamed its "Course Management System" product category into the "Learning Management Systems" category in order to sell to the corporate space.&lt;ref name=Techway&gt;{{cite news |title=Big company on campus: Blackboard hopes an IPO will help it dominate the Internet education market |first=Alex |last=Daniels |url= |newspaper=Washington Techway |date=January 29, 2001 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;{{cite news |title=Help for an Earning Curve |first=Shannon |last=Henry |url= |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=May 11, 2000 |page=E01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal matters==
The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] granted the company {{US patent|6988138}} for "Internet-based education support system and methods" in January 2006. The patent established Blackboard's claims to the concept of connecting together web-based tools to create an interconnected university-wide course management system.&lt;ref name=Pope&gt;{{cite news |title=E-Learning Firm Sparks Controversy With Software Patent |first=Justin |last=Pope |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=October 15, 2006 |page=A07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm announced the patent on July 26, 2006, and on the same day it filed a patent infringement lawsuit against rival education software company [[Desire2Learn]] Inc.&lt;ref name=Pope/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.immagic.com/eLibrary/ARCHIVES/GENERAL/USCOURTS/T060726C.pdf |title=Case 9:06-cv-00155-RHC (Court documents) |date=July 26, 2006 |work=IMMagic e-library |accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to news reports, the awarding of the patent and the lawsuit against Desire2Learn led to concerns about [[patentability]] in the electronic learning community.

A website, BoycottBlackboard.org, was set up 8-2-2006 by Chris Hambly based on a WHOIS Search, calling for a boycott of the company's products and offering an online petition to be signed by those who opposed the patent. In addition, some critics of the patent and lawsuit created a Wikipedia entry for the [[history of virtual learning environments]] to document existing examples of course management software.&lt;ref name=Pope/&gt; The [[Software Freedom Law Center]] filed a request with the U.S. Patent Office to re-examine Blackboard's patent in November 2006, and in January 2007 the request was approved on the basis of prior art, cited by the Center, raising "substantial" questions.&lt;ref name=Hammer20070205&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackboard's patent may be in jeopardy after review |author=Ben Hammer |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2007/02/05/story2.html |work=[[Washington Business Journal]] |date=February 5, 2007 |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address the concerns raised within the education software and academic communities, in February 2007, the firm announced that it had made a pledge to not assert its patent rights against open-source and non-profit software developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackboard: Patent won't be used against nonprofits |first=Ben |last=Hammer |url= |newspaper=Washington Business Journal |date=February 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackboard.com/legal/patent-pledge.aspx |title=The Blackboard Patent Pledge |work=Blackboard.com |publisher=Blackboard Inc. |accessdate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, a federal jury in Texas ruled in favor of Blackboard Inc. in its patent infringement suit against Desire2Learn, finding the rival company liable for infringing on its patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackboard wins patent lawsuit |first=Darlene |last=Darcy |url= |newspaper=Washington Business Journal |date=February 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month later, in March 2008, the U.S. Patent Office issued a preliminary decision following its re-examination of Blackboard's patent application, which rejected the 44 claims made by the company. The Patent Office stated that it would give a final decision following a review of the patent.&lt;ref name=Mangan&gt;{{cite news |title=Patent Office Hands Blackboard a Setback |first=Katherine |last=Mangan |newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=April 11, 2008 |page=4 |volume=54 |issue=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the ruling by the federal jury in February 2008, later that year Desire2Learn lodged an appeal with the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]]. A ruling was made by the Court of Appeals on July 27, 2009 that the 38 patent claims made by Blackboard in its suit against Desire2Learn were invalid.&lt;ref name="WBJ July09"&gt;{{cite news |title= Court rules against Blackboard in patent case |first= Darlene |last=Darcy |newspaper=Washington Business Journal |date=July 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute was resolved, when Blackboard and Desire2Learn announced on December 15, 2009 that each company was settling all ongoing litigation between them and had made a [[cross-licensing]] agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blackboard settles legal brawl |first=Darlene |last=Darcy |url= |newspaper=Washington Business Journal |date=December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/12/16/blackboard |title=Clean slate |last1=Kolowich |first1=Steve |date=December 16, 2009 |work=Inside Higher Ed |accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010, the firm abandoned patent 6,988,138, and in November that year the company's legal counsel announced the patent's "official termination" and stated that Blackboard had ended its appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/blackboard-drops-appeals-on-software-patent/28494 |title=Blackboard Drops Appeals on Software Patent |last1=Keller |first1=Josh |date=November 30, 2010 |work=Wired Campus |publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education |accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Camara''' is a [[social enterprise]] that sends refurbished [[computers]] and provides [[digital literacy]] training  to schools and other educational institutions in [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Rwanda]], [[Zambia]], [[Uganda]], [[Lesotho]], [[Tanzania]], [[Jamaica]], and [[Haiti]]. 

==History==

Camara was founded in 2005 by Cormac Lynch, a former engineer and investment banker, who after a visit to Ethiopia saw an opportunity to use technology to enhance education in some of the world's most disadvantaged communities. Lynch heard from schools that computers were what were needed most. On his return to Dublin he saw a skip-load of discarded PCs, when an idea struck, which would see Camara give end of life computers a new lease of life and benefit school children in disadvantaged communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/reuse-reboot-recycle-how-old-irish-computers-are-starting-new-lives-abroad-1.1371367|title=Reuse, reboot, recycle: how old Irish computers are starting new lives abroad|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2017-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name 'Camara' comes from a west African [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] dialect and means 'teacher' or 'one who teaches with experience'. Many people read it as 'Camera' and pronounce it as such, however the correct pronunciation is {{nowrap|'Ca ma ra'}}. The organisation's logo, the ANANSE NTONTAN ("spider's web"), comes from the adinkra symbols found in Ghana and historically used by the Asante tribe on cloth, walls and in pottery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://camara.org/about-us/|title=About Us in Ireland {{!}} Camara Education|website=camara.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higgins]] is one of the organisation's patrons, as is British film producer and educator [[David Puttnam|Lord David Puttnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://camara.org/about-us/our-people/|title=Our People {{!}} Camara Education|website=camara.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5569">The '''Department of Political Science''' of [[Soochow University (Taiwan)|Soochow University]] is one of the oldest departement of the university. This departement exists since 1954, when Soochow University was reestablished in [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scu.edu.tw/artsoc/english2/politics.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Department of Political Science of [[Soochow University (Taiwan)|Soochow University has over 50&amp;nbsp;years of history]], being one of the four departments that existed during the reestablishment of the university in Taiwan in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eProfile&lt;/ref&gt; The Master program of the department was established in 1991; followed by the Doctoral program in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eGraduate&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Soochow University (Taiwan)|2003]], in a very rigorous review held by Soochow University, the Department of Political Science was evaluated excellent among the inspectors from the Evaluation and Review Committee of academic fields. The department is also awarded with financial support to help to fund many teaching and research activities and projects with unique features.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scu.edu.tw/artsoc/english2/politics.html http://myweb.scu.edu.tw/~ctl/eng-old/page-1-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
The Department has also been funded by the [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Ministry of Education]] under the [http://www.studyintaiwan.org/teaching_excellence.html Teaching Excellence Projects].&lt;ref&gt;http://myweb.scu.edu.tw/~ctl/eng-old/page-1-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009, Shiow-Duan Hawang is the director of the department.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eTeacher&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs and goals==
The teaching program is characterized by a multidisciplinary approach of [[history of political thought]], [[Comparative Government and Politics]], [[international relations]] and [[public administration]].&lt;ref&gt;http://myweb.scu.edu.tw/~ctl/eng-old/page-1-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
The international exchanges and various academic activities and lectures for teachers and students play an important role in this department.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eTeacher.&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching programs of the department are particularly oriented on [[Status of Taiwan|international issues]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eProfile&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to basic trainings in political science, the departement offers diversified curriculum and programs open to international students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eProfile&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific Research==

From [[Quarterly|1999]] to [[Quarterly|2008]], teachers of the Department have conducted 90 research projects granted by the government and its [[National Science Council]].&lt;ref&gt;http://myweb.scu.edu.tw/~ctl/eng-old/page-1-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000,&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eProfile&lt;/ref&gt; the Department of Political Science has been organized the Research Center, the Center for [[Globalization|Globalization Studies]], the Center for [[Globalization|E.U]] Studies, the Centre for Parliamentary Research, the Center for [[U.N]], Studies and the Metropolitan Governance Study Center and the Workshop of [[Human Rights]] and [[Democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eProfile&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Quarterly|Soochow Journal of Political Science]]==

With its first issue released in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eJournal.&lt;/ref&gt; the Soochow Journal of Political Science has continued to develop its reputation. Since the journal changed to a [[Quarterly|quarterly publication]] in September 2004, the Soochow Journal of Political Science has been included in the TSSCI ([[Taiwan Social Science Citation Index]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://db1n.sinica.edu.tw/textdb/tssci/searchindexe.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The contributions published in the journal come from a wide range of research related to the most diverse areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/journal/ejournalrul.asp.&lt;/ref&gt;
Many professors, researchers, teachers or researchers in political science from [[Soochow University (Taipei)|Soochow University]], as elsewhere, had contributed to the writing of this journal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eProfile&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Dirk Jan Struik was born in 1894 in [[Rotterdam]], Netherlands, as a teacher's son. He attended the Hogereburgerschool (HBS) over there. It was in this school that he was first introduced to [[left-wing politics]] and [[socialism]] by one of his teachers, called Mister van Dam.

In 1912 Struik entered the [[University of Leiden]], where he showed great interest in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], influenced by the eminent professors [[Paul Ehrenfest]] and [[Hendrik Lorentz]].

In 1917 he worked as a high school mathematics teacher for a while, after which he worked as a research assistant for [[Jan Arnoldus Schouten|J.A. Schouten]]. It was during this period that he developed his doctoral dissertation, "The Application of [[Tensor]] Methods to [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian Manifolds]]."

In 1922 Struik obtained his doctorate in mathematics from University of Leiden. He was appointed to a teaching position at [[Utrecht University|University of Utrecht]] in 1923. The same year he married [[Saly Ruth Ramler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Élie Cartan et Saly Ruth Ramler – Médias – MSN Encarta |url=http://fr.ca.encarta.msn.com/media_941562541/%C3%89lie_Cartan_et_Saly_Ruth_Ramler.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwbOiM5G?url=http://fr.ca.encarta.msn.com/media_941562541/%C3%89lie_Cartan_et_Saly_Ruth_Ramler.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a Czech mathematician with a doctorate from the [[Charles University of Prague]]. 

In 1924, funded by a Rockefeller fellowship, Struik traveled to [[Rome]] to collaborate with the Italian mathematician [[Tullio Levi-Civita]]. It was in Rome that Struik first developed a keen interest in the [[history of mathematics]]. In 1925, thanks to an extension of his fellowship, Struik went to [[Göttingen]] to work with [[Richard Courant]] compiling [[Felix Klein]]'s lectures on the history of 19th-century mathematics. He also started researching [[Renaissance]] mathematics at this time.

In 1926 Struik was offered positions both at the [[Moscow State University]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He decided to accept the latter, where he spent the rest of his academic career. He collaborated with [[Norbert Wiener]] on [[differential geometry]], while continuing his research on the history of mathematics. He was made full professor at MIT in 1940.

Struik was a steadfast [[Marxist]]. Having joined the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands]] in 1919, he remained a Party member his entire life. When asked, upon the occasion of his 100th birthday, how he managed to pen [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal articles at such an advanced age, Struik replied blithely that he had the "3Ms" a man needs to sustain himself: Marriage (his wife, Saly Ruth Ramler, was not alive anymore though when he turned one hundred in 1994), Mathematics and Marxism. 

It is therefore not surprising that Dirk suffered persecution during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthyite]] era. He was accused of being a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy, a charge he vehemently denied. Invoking the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] Amendments of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]], he refused to answer any of the 200 questions put forward to him during the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|HUAC]] hearing. He was suspended from teaching for five years (with full salary) by MIT in the 1950s. Struik was re-instated in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Deaths: Dirk J. Struik, Mathematician |journal= The Washington Post |date=October 29, 2000 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2000/10/29/deaths/0218ebef-1294-461b-aa0f-43b6bf69b485/?utm_term=.b4f93f64b63f |accessdate= October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from MIT in 1960.

Aside from purely academic work, Struik also helped found the [[Journal of Science and Society]], a Marxian journal on the [[History of science|history]], [[Science studies|sociology]] and development of science.

In 1950 Struik published his ''Lectures on Classical Differential Geometry'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bompiani, E.|authorlink=Enrico Bompiani|title=Review: ''Lectures on classical differential geometry'' by D. J. Struik|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|year=1951|volume=57|issue=2|pages=154–155|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1951-57-02/S0002-9904-1951-09487-2/S0002-9904-1951-09487-2.pdf|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1951-09487-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gained praise from [[Ian R. Porteous]]:
:Of all the textbooks on elementary differential geometry published in the last fifty years the most readable is one of the earliest, namely that by D.J. Struik (1950). He is the only one to mention [[Allvar Gullstrand]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian R. Porteous (2001) ''Geometric Differentiation'', p 319, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|0-521-00264-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Struik's other major works include such classics as ''A Concise History of Mathematics'' (1948),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rowe, David E.|authorlink=David E. Rowe|title=Looking back on a bestseller: Dirk Struik's ''A Concise History of Mathematics''|journal=Notices Amer. Math. Soc.|year=2001|volume=48|issue=6|pages=590–592|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200106/rev-rowe.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yankee Science in the Making'', ''The Birth of [[the Communist Manifesto]]'', and ''A Source Book in Mathematics, 1200–1800'', all of which are considered standard textbooks or references.

Struik died October 21, 2000, exactly three weeks after celebrating his 106th birthday.

{{Education in the U.S.}}
The '''Education Resources Information Center''' ('''ERIC''') is an online [[digital library]] of education research and information. ERIC is sponsored by the [[Institute of Education Sciences]] of the [[United States Department of Education]].

==Description==
The mission of ERIC is to provide a comprehensive, easy-to-use, searchable, Internet-based bibliographic and full-text database of education research and information for educators, researchers, and the general public. Education research and information are essential to improving teaching, learning, and educational decision-making.

ERIC provides access to 1.5 million bibliographic records ([[citation]]s, [[Abstract (summary)|abstracts]], and other pertinent data) of journal articles and other education-related materials, with hundreds of new records added every week. A key component of ERIC is its collection of [[grey literature]] in education, which is largely available in full text in [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] [[PDF format]]. Approximately one quarter of the complete ERIC Collection is available in full text. Materials with no full text available (primarily journal articles) can often be accessed using links to publisher websites and/or library holdings. ERIC usually includes education related articles in its database. Sample articles include "The Economic, Social and Administrative Pharmacy (ESAP) Discipline in US Schools and Colleges of Pharmacy&lt;ref&gt;https://eric.ed.gov/?q=esap&amp;id=ED552882&lt;/ref&gt;", "Aesthetics in Young Children's Lives: From Music Technology Curriculum Perspective &lt;ref&gt;https://eric.ed.gov/?q=Aesthetics+in+Young+Children%27s+Lives%3a+From+Music+Technology+Curriculum+Perspective&amp;id=ED552884&lt;/ref&gt;", and "Digital Game's Impacts on Students' Learning Effectiveness of Correct Medication &lt;ref&gt;https://eric.ed.gov/?q=Digital+Game%E2%80%99s+Impacts+on+Students%E2%80%99+Learning+Effectiveness+of+Correct+Medication&amp;id=ED579148&lt;/ref&gt;". 

The ERIC Collection, begun in 1966, contains records for a variety of publication types, including: 
*journal articles
*books
*research syntheses
*conference papers
*technical reports
*dissertations
*policy papers, and
*other education-related materials

ERIC provides the public with a centralized Web site for searching the ERIC collection and submitting materials to be considered for inclusion in the collection. Users can also access the collection through commercial database vendors, statewide and institutional networks, and Internet search engines. To help users find the information they are seeking, ERIC produces a [[controlled vocabulary]], the Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors. This is a carefully selected list of education-related words and phrases used to tag materials by subject and make them easier to retrieve through a search.

Prior to January 2004, the ERIC network consisted of sixteen subject-specific clearinghouses, various adjunct and affiliate clearinghouses, and three support components. The program was consolidated into a single entity, with upgraded systems, and paper-based processes converted to electronic, thus streamlining operations and speeding delivery of content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eric.ed.gov/pdf/ERIC_Retrospective.pdf|title=Fifty Years of ERIC: 1964-2014|last=|first=|date=2014|website=ERIC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Education and Inspections Act 2006''' (c 40) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. According to the government the Act "''is intended to represent a major step forward in the Government’s aim of ensuring that all children in all schools get the education they need to enable them to fulfil their potential"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfes.gov.uk/publications/educationandinspectionsact/docs/Guide%20to%20the%20Education%20and%20Inspections%20Act.pdf DfES guide to the Education and Inspections Bill 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background to the Act==

=== Trust schools white paper ===
In October 2005, the DfES published the [[White Paper]] ''Higher Standards, Better Schools for All — More Choice for Parents and Pupils''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Higher Standards, Better Schools for All — More Choice for Parents and Pupils | url = http://www.dfes.gov.uk/publications/schoolswhitepaper/pdfs/DfES-Schools%20White%20Paper.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It set out plans to "''radically improve the system''". The [[blurb]] distributed with it established a number of key areas that the White Paper was intended to address:

* The challenge to reform
* A school system shaped by parents
* Choice and access for all
* Personalised learning
* Parents driving improvement
* Supporting children and parents
* School discipline
* The school workforce and school leadership
* A new role for local authorities

====Trust schools====
One of the most controversial elements in the White Paper was the proposal to establish a new breed of school called a Trust school. The White Paper introduced a new term to the educational [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] when it explained how schools would "''acquire a Trust''". It was noted that there was a remarkable similarity between Trust schools and [[voluntary aided school]]s/[[Foundation school]]s. The proposals allowed for each Trust school to decide its own [[School governors|governance]] model from either the VA or Foundation model. Local authority assets - buildings and land - would be transferred to trust ownership, and the trust would take on the responsibility for the employment of all the school staff.

The governance model of VA Schools would allow the Trust to directly appoint more than half of the governors allowing it to effectively control the governing body. Such a model would also reduce the number of elected Parent governors. To tackle this obvious reduction in ''parent power'' it was proposed that a new consultative body - ''a Parents’ Council to ensure that parents have a strong voice in decisions about the way the school is run'' - although it was stressed that statutory guidance on this would be produced at some yet unspecified later stage. This notion effectively killed any suggestion that Kelly could be seen as a champion of parents.

The Trusts were intended to be non-profit making and to have charitable status, although they could be formed by commercial enterprises. In fact one of the early DfES-hosted seminars on the establishment of Trusts included representatives from [[Microsoft]] and [[KPMG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 2006-02-09 | title = PM talks of school reforms 'hell' | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4695298.stm | publisher = BBC News | accessdate = 2006-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was their ability to set their own admission arrangements that generated the most criticism.

====Political fallout====
The white paper was not received with universal acclaim. A large number of Labour backbenchers, as well as numerous Labour luminaries like [[Neil Kinnock]] and former Education Secretary [[Estelle Morris]], made known their opposition to the proposals and published an alternative white paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shaping the Education Bill - reaching for consensus |url=http://www.compassonline.org.uk/educationdebate/index2.asp |publisher=Compass |accessdate=2006-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210161236/http://www.compassonline.org.uk/educationdebate/index2.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=February 10, 2006 }} &lt;/ref&gt; Faced with such a rebellion, the government initially stressed that it would ''press on'' with the reforms. [[Tory]] leader [[David Cameron]] then announced that these reforms were in line with Tory policies and that he would support the bill if presented in the proposed form. The government were faced with the prospect of pushing through their reforms only with opposition support and in the face of increased resistance from its own supporters.

Following a report by the [[Education and Skills Committee|Education Select Committee]] -  which was in itself controversial - [[Ruth Kelly]] finally wrote&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 2006-02-06 | title = Ruth Kelly's letter | url = http://www.dfes.gov.uk/hottopics/docs/ruth%20kelly%20letter.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = Department for Education and Skills | accessdate = 2006-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the committee chairman [[Barry Sheerman]] in February 2006, outlining how the bill would look when presented to parliament and stressing how it would accommodate many of the fears expressed in the committee's report. This was reported as the government backtracking on many key issues although it stressed that it was not a climbdown.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

===The Education and Inspections Bill 2006===
On 28 February 2006, the bill was finally published. It contained much of what had been trailed, although most notable by its absence was any mention of "''Trust school''". In reality, Foundation and Voluntary Aided schools will pick up the mantle of "Trust school".

The Act is designed to give greater freedoms to schools, including the possibility of:
*Owning their own assets
*Employing their own staff
*Setting their own admissions arrangements

Other important provisions include:
*Creation of a [[Local Authority]] duty to promote fair access to educational opportunities
*Giving schools staff a clear statutory right to discipline students
*By law, all state (not private) schools must have a behaviour policy in place that includes measures to prevent all forms of [[school bullying|bullying among pupils]]. This policy is decided by the school. All teachers, pupils and parents must be told what it is.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/bullying-at-school&lt;/ref&gt;
*Provisions relating to nutritional standards of school food
*Reform of the school inspectorates

'''Eleanor Catton''' {{postnominals|MNZM|country=NZL}} (born 24 September 1985) is a [[Canada|Canadian]]-born [[New Zealand]] author. Her second novel, ''[[The Luminaries]]'', won the [[2013 Man Booker Prize]]. In January 2015, she generated controversy in New Zealand when she made comments in an interview in India in which she was critical of "[[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal]], profit-obsessed, very shallow, very money-hungry politicians who do not care about culture."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11394725 Paul Little: Key and Plunket prove Catton's point], New Zealand Herald, 1 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Catton was born in Canada where her American-born New Zealander father was a graduate student completing his doctorate at the [[University of Western Ontario]]. She grew up in [[Christchurch]] after her family returned to New Zealand when she was six years old; she spent a year living in [[Leeds]] where she attended [[Lawnswood School]]. She referred to this experience as "amazing, but a real eye opener" due to the toughness of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/profile/eleanor-catton-interview.html|work=The Bookseller|date=15 October 2013|last=Tivnan|first=Tom|title=Eleanor Catton Interview|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|title=Eleanor Catton: 'I'm strongly influenced by box-set TV drama.

==Career==
Catton's [[debut novel]], ''[[The Rehearsal (novel)|The Rehearsal]]'', was published in 2008. It was written as her Master's thesis,&lt;ref name=bookmunch&gt;{{cite web|last=Clarkson|first=Annie|title=‘I am still astonished and a little bit suspicious that The Rehearsal has even been published’ – An Interview with Eleanor Catton &amp;#124; Bookmunch|url=http://bookmunch.wordpress.com/2009/08/04/i-am-still-astonished-and-a-little-bit-suspicious-that-the-rehearsal-has-even-been-published-an-interview-with-eleanor-catton/|work=Bookmunch|accessdate=19 September 2013|date=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deals with reactions to an affair between a male teacher and a girl at his secondary school. That year, she was awarded a fellowship to the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]].&lt;ref name=brisbane&gt;{{cite news |last=McEvoy |first=Mark|title=Interview: Eleanor Catton|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/books/interview-eleanor-catton-20130912-2tl9e.html|work=[[Brisbane Times]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=19 September 2013|date=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 she was described by the British [[Daily Mail]] as "this year's golden girl of fiction".&lt;ref name=dailymail&gt;{{cite news|last=McKay|first=Carla|title=Eleanor Catton: The Rehearsal|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-1201093/Eleanor-Catton-The-Rehearsal.html|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[DMG Media]]|accessdate=19 September 2013|date=21 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, she was the Ursula Bethell Writer in Residence at the [[University of Canterbury]].&lt;ref name=ursulabethell&gt;{{cite web|title=Ursula Bethell Residency in Creative Writing |url=http://www.hums.canterbury.ac.nz/engl/writer.shtml#about |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013–present===
Catton's second novel, ''[[The Luminaries]]'', was published in 2013. The novel is set on the goldfields of New Zealand in 1866. It was shortlisted for and subsequently won the [[2013 Man Booker Prize]] making Catton, at the age of 28, the youngest author ever to win the Booker.&lt;ref name=age&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Linda|title=Eleanor Catton youngest author ever shortlisted for Booker|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/books/eleanor-catton-youngest-author-ever-shortlisted-for-booker-20130911-2tjjm.html|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=19 September 2013|date=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24541612|title=Man Booker Prize: Eleanor Catton becomes youngest winner with The Luminaries|last=Masters|first=Tim|date=15 October 2013|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was previously, at the age of 27, the youngest author ever to be shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize.&lt;ref name=age/&gt;

At 832 pages, ''[[The Luminaries]]'' is the longest work to win the prize in its 45-year history.&lt;ref name="Masters"/&gt; The chair of the judges, [[Robert Macfarlane (travel writer)|Robert Macfarlane]] commented "It's a dazzling work. It's a luminous work. It is vast without being sprawling." Catton was presented with the prize by the [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Duchess of Cornwall]] on 15 October 2013 at [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]].&lt;ref name="Masters"/&gt;

In November 2013 Catton was awarded the Canadian Governor General's Literary Award for fiction for ''The Luminaries''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3news.co.nz/Eleanor-Catton-honoured-with-Canadian-literary-award/tabid/418/articleID/321305/Default.aspx#.UoVnTOHIhnE Eleanor Catton honoured with Canadian literary award].

== Controversy ==
During an interview at the [[Jaipur Literature Festival|Jaipur Literary Festival]] in January 2015, Catton said that the governments of Australia, Canada and New Zealand were led by "neo-liberal, profit-obsessed, very shallow, very money-hungry politicians who do not care about culture... They care about short-term gains. They would destroy the planet in order to be able to have the life they want. I feel very angry with my Government".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11395020 Deborah Hill Cone: Catton success illuminated nation], New Zealand Herald, 2 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Prime Minister [[John Key]] said he was disappointed at Catton's lack of respect for his Government and claimed she was aligned with the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]]. The next day he said her views should not be given any more credence than those of the [[Peter Leitch (businessman)|Peter "The Mad Butcher" Leitch]] or [[Richie McCaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11395177|title=Eleanor Catton has 'no particular great insights into politics', says John Key|date=2015-02-01|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, on air RadioLive host [[Sean Plunket]] called Catton a traitor and an "ungrateful hua".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.odt.co.nz/entertainment/books/331335/catton-lets-rip-kiwi-attitudes-and-political-direction |title= Catton a 'traitor', says Plunket |work= Otago Daily Times |date=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taxpayers' Union also released a media statement showing Catton had received around $50,000 in [[Creative New Zealand]] support over her career. Jordan Williams of the Taxpayers' Union argued that: "if Ms Catton isn't thankful for the support by the New Zealand Government while she wrote The Luminaries, maybe she should use some of the substantial royalties to pay the money back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11394285 | title=Kiwis have been generous to Catton, says Taxpayers' Union | work=The New Zealand Herald | date=30 January 2015 | accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a blog post responding to the affair, Catton commented that her reported remarks were a condensed part of a larger interview, and she was puzzled why her comment at the Jaipur festival had generated such controversy: "I’ve been speaking freely to foreign journalists ever since I was first published overseas, and have criticised the Key government, neo-liberal values, and our culture of anti-intellectualism many times."&lt;ref name="EC blog post"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eleanor-catton.com/statement/ | title=A Statement | work=eleanor-catton.com | accessdate=2 February 2015 | author=Catton, Eleanor}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued:
{{quote|In future interviews with foreign media, I will of course discuss the inflammatory, vicious, and patronising things that have been broadcast and published in New Zealand this week. I will of course discuss the frightening swiftness with which the powerful Right move to discredit and silence those who question them, and the culture of fear and hysteria that prevails. But I will hope for better, and demand it.&lt;ref name="EC blog post" /&gt;}}

The criticism of Catton caused a media storm, including the publication of numerous cartoons,&lt;ref&gt;[http://liberation.typepad.com/liberation/2015/01/cartoons-images-of-cattongate.html Cartoons &amp; images of Cattongate], Bryce Edwards&lt;/ref&gt; and was termed "Cattongate" by one commentator.&lt;ref name="nzherald.co.nz"&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&amp;objectid=11395912 Bryce Edwards: The politics of Eleanor Catton and public debate], New Zealand Herald, 3 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In an opinion piece, Bryce Edwards quoted numerous commentators who supported Catton's right to express her views. He said the controversy reflected the hollowness of public debate in New Zealand, and of the media and politics, and is increasingly of concern to some academics, researchers, and journalists. He also said that for some people, the saga also relates to the more recent [[Dirty Politics]] scandal.&lt;ref name="nzherald.co.nz"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Catton lives in [[Auckland]] with her husband, American/New Zealander author and poet Steven Toussaint, and teaches creative writing at the [[Manukau Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite news|title=Eleanor Catton's success is written in the stars|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/books-poetry/interviews/eleanor-cattons-success-is-written-in-the-stars.22047866|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|publisher=[[Newsquest]]|accessdate=19 September 2013|date=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sexism in lit Guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/16/eleanor-catton-male-writers-female-luminaries-booker-2013 | title=Eleanor Catton: 'Male writers get asked what they think, women what they feel' | work=The Guardian | date=16 October 2013 | accessdate=2 February 2015 | author=Higgins, Charlotte}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=11568902 Luminaries author marries long-time partner], NZ Herald, 3 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erasmus Student Network''' ('''ESN''') is a Europe-wide [[student organisation]]. Its goal is to support and develop student exchange on a local, national and international level. It is composed of around 13,500 members in over 530 local sections in 40 countries in [[Higher Education]] Institutions, including [[University|universities]], [[Institute of technology|polytechnics]], and [[university college]]s. The [[social network|network]] offers its services to around 160,000 international students.&lt;ref&gt;Erasmus Student Network - {{cite web |url=http://www.esn.org/content/what-esn |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012165133/http://www.esn.org/content/what-esn |archivedate=12 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESN facilitates the [[social]] and [[personal identity|personal]] integration of international students. The local ESN sections offer help, guidance and valuable information to both exchange students and students doing a full degree abroad. ESN provides information about academic exchange programmes and student mobility in general.

==History==
In 1987, the [[European Community]] approved a plan to create a mobility scheme for higher education. Part of it was the [[Erasmus programme]] - an exchange programme for students to provide students with the opportunity to spend part of their studies abroad.

In 1989 the Erasmus Bureau invited 32 former Erasmus Students for an evaluation meeting in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]]. This meeting was the starting point for the Erasmus Student Network. The lack of peer-to-peer support was singled out as a major issue and the driving force behind the creation of the Erasmus Student Network, named for the Dutch Renaissance [[Erasmus of Rotterdam|humanist]].&lt;ref&gt;ESN website, http://esn.org/erasmus&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1994 ESN had 60 sections in 14 countries. In 2004 the ESN network consisted of 170 sections in and outside Europe, from [[Scandinavia]] to [[Morocco]]. ESN has been growing with an average rate of around 12% since then.

In 2005, ESN established its headquarters in Brussels and legally registered as a Belgian non-profit organisation.

As of November 25, 2017, the Erasmus Student Network consists of 533 local associations ("sections") in 40 countries&lt;ref&gt;ESN Sections - http://esn.org/sections&lt;/ref&gt; and has more than 13,500 volunteers across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;About ESN - http://esn.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
ESN works on three levels - local, national and international. It is only active within the borders defined by the [[Council of Europe]]. Its president for the 2015-16 term is Safi Sabuni.

===Local level===
ESN on local level consists of "sections" that directly work with the international students. They organize activities like introduction programmes, get-togethers and cultural events and represent the exchange students and their needs towards academic institutions and local authorities. Together the local sections, or rather representatives from the sections form the Annual General Meeting (AGM), the highest decision-making body of ESN.

===National level===
The national level represents the needs of international students towards governments and national authorities. Local sections in the same countries together form a National Platform (NP) who can elect a National Board and elects a National Representative (NR) to represent the national network on the international level.

===International level===
The International Board is the executive body of ESN International and consists of five Board members (President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Communication Manager and Web Project Administrator). Since 2005, the members of the International Board are full-time volunteers living and working in Brussels. The International Board is supported by the Secretariat composed of employed staff.

Each country elects a National Representative and all National Representatives form the Council of National Representatives (CNR). During the year they represent the interest of the network and are, after the AGM, the highest decision-making body.

ESN has five International Committees that work together with its respective international board member in charge. The Committees of ESN are - International Committee of Education (ICE), Network and Events Committee (NEC), Finance Committee (FiCo), Communication Committee (ComCom)and IT Committee (IT).

===Major projects===
While sections are independent to organise their activities on the local level, ESN runs several international projects that are implemented across the Network. The Social Erasmus projects aims to integrate international students into the local community via charity, environmental and education actions.&lt;ref&gt;Erasmus Student Network - http://socialerasmus.esn.org/&lt;/ref&gt; ExchangeAbility aims to improve the situation for students with special needs and support those students to realise a mobility period.&lt;ref&gt;Erasmus Student Network - http://www.esn.org/content/exchangeability/{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; PRIME and ESNSurvey are the main research projects that enable ESN to continuously monitor issues concerning international students. ESN widely implements the Responsible Party campaign to raise students´ awareness on responsible drinking.&lt;ref&gt;Responsible Party - http://www.responsible-party.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==International events==
Since its foundation in 1989, ESN holds Annual General Meetings (AGM), alternating in major cities throughout Europe.

Other activities include annual Cultural Medleys (CM) from 1999 until 2012, and annual meetings of the organization's five Regional Platforms. These Regional Platforms are:
* Central European Platform (CEP) - Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia
* Northern European Platform (NEP) - Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Norway, and Sweden
*Western European Platform (WEP) - Luxembourg, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom
*South-Western European Platform (SWEP) - France, Italy, Malta, Portugal, and Spain
*South-Eastern European Platform (SEEP) - Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Georgia, Greece, Italy, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Turkey.

== Weaknesses ==

* Despite the fact that the person who is testing allowed for testing upon presentation of a passport, this protection was ineffective to prevent test taking another person. For example, a graduate student from the [[University of Lviv]] for a fee agreed in 2008 to make a test of the Ukrainian language and literature at the graduate school of one of [[Dnipropetrovsk]]. Rigging was found.&lt;ref&gt;Ukrainian Pravda. Life." From my own experience: As I have written tests rather than graduate." Retrieved May 20, 2009 http://life.pravda.com.ua/columns/2009/05/20/20001/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Annual change the rules of admission to universities.
* In case of errors that occur are not very rare, applicants may be admitted their scores. Because of this act to university entrants this fails.

== Benefits ==

* Creation of conditions for equal access to education for all, regardless of financial means
* Objectivity (not always the case. Example, when checking their statements is a human factor)
* Dealing with corruption at the local level, but the emergence of global corruption.
* Getting closer to European standards

'''Hanban''' ({{zh|s=汉办|p=Hàn bàn}}) is the colloquial abbreviation for the '''Office of Chinese Language Council International''', originally called  '''China National Office for Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language''' (NOTCFL) during 2002 to 2006.

==Administration==
The '''Office of Chinese Language Council International''' ({{zh|s=国家汉语国际推广领导小组办公室|p=guójiā Hànyǔ guójì tuīguǎng lǐngdǎo xiǎozǔ bàngōngshì}}) is affiliated with the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Education]]. Hanban describes itself as a "non-government and non-profit organization",&lt;ref name="About Hanban"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Hanban |publisher=The Office of Chinese Language Council International – North America Office |url=http://www.hanban.ca/hanban.php?lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=September 2014}} but ''The Economist'' calls it a "government entity".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/china/21616988-decade-ago-china-began-opening-centres-abroad-promote-its-culture-some-people-are-pushing A decade ago China began opening centres abroad to promote its culture. Some people are pushing back], ''The Economist'', 13 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The current President of the Chinese Language Council International is Vice Premier [[Liu Yandong]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Hanban|url=http://confucius.tamu.edu/content/about-hanban|publisher=Confucius Institute at Texas A&amp;M University|accessdate=18 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819085145/http://confucius.tamu.edu/content/about-hanban|archivedate=19 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and organizationally it sits directly under the Ministry of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.hanban.org/node_7719.htm|website=Hanban-AboutUs|publisher=Hanban|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[mission statement]]: "Hanban is committed to developing Chinese language and culture teaching resources and making its services available worldwide, meeting the demands of overseas Chinese learners to the utmost degree, and to contributing to global cultural diversity and harmony."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.hanban.edu.cn/hbsm.php |title=国家汉办_孔子学院总部 |publisher=English.hanban.edu.cn |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the Council is charged with cultivating knowledge and interest in the Chinese language and culture in nations around the world that are not native speakers of Chinese.

The following twelve state ministries and commissions are represented in the Chinese Language Council International:&lt;ref name="About Hanban" /&gt;
* General Office of the State Council
* Ministry of Education
* Ministry of Finance
* Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council
* Ministry of Foreign Affairs
* State Development and Reform Commission
* Ministry of Commerce
* Ministry of Culture
* State Administration of Radio Film and Television (China Radio International)

==Criticisms and controversies==
Academics and journalists have criticized the Hanban, particularly the Confucius Institute program that has rapidly grown worldwide since 2004.

===Confucius Institute===
{{main|Criticisms of Confucius Institutes}}
Hanban is most notable for the [[Confucius Institute]] program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Don Starr |year=2009|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-3435.2008.01371.x/full|title=Chinese Language Education in Europe: the Confucius Institutes|work=[[European Journal of Education]]|others=Volume 44, Issue 1|pages = 65–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it also sponsors the Chinese Bridge competition, which is a competition in Chinese proficiency for non-native speakers. On April 2007 while inspecting Hanban, [[Li Changchun]], member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo in charge of ideology and propaganda stated that: "the construction of Confucius Institutes is an important channel to glorify Chinese culture, to help Chinese culture spread to the world...(which is) part of China's foreign propaganda strategy""&lt;ref name="atimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hsktests.com/language-chinese-soft-power-us/|title=The language of Chinese soft power in the US|author=Will Wachter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, the [[Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China]] announced that the winning bid to build and maintain the Confucius Institute Online website was awarded to the Hanban subsidiary company Wuzhou Hanfeng Web Technology Ltd. (Wuzhou Hanfeng Wangluo Keji 五洲汉风网络科技) for 35.2 million ''[[Renminbi|yuan]]'' (US$5.7 million).&lt;ref&gt;[http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2012/06/weibo-the-cost-of-confucius-institutes/ The Cost of Confucius Institutes], [[China Digital Times]], 01 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://suxin.crtvu.edu.cn/bbs/archiver/?tid-8128.html |title=官人我要建网站：孔子学院网站运营服务3520万元，中国工会网网站改版670万元(页 1) - 聊天空间 - 讨论室-苏辛工作室 - powered by Discuz!

The CIs are also criticized for their hiring practices. It was revealed that CI teachers are forbidden to have any in class discussion on or any involvement with topics sensitive to the Chinese regime, such as the Uyghurs, Tibet, Falun Gong, democracy advocates, etc. Canada's McMaster University terminated its contract with its CI after Sonia Zhao, former teacher at the University's CI, quit her job, and subsequently appealed to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario for the university's “giving legitimization to discrimination.” Under her job contract with the CI Ms. Zhao was forced to hide her belief in Falun Gong, a spiritual movement persecuted by the Communist party of China.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/mcmaster-closing-confucius-institute-over-hiring-issues/article8372894/ McMaster closing Confucius Institute over hiring issues], The Globe and Mail, 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two North American associations of educators warned that Confucius Institutes were threatening academic freedoms. In December 2013, the [[Canadian Association of University Teachers]] (CAUT) passed a resolution, "That all universities and colleges in Canada which currently host Confucius Institutes on their campuses cease doing so, and universities and colleges currently contemplating such arrangements pursue them no further." CAUT executive director James Turk described CIs as "essentially political arms of the Chinese government",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universitiesnews.com/2014/01/02/canadas-association-of-university-teachers-calls-on-universities-to-close-confucius-institutes/ Canada's Association of University Teachers Calls on Universities to Close Confucius Institutes], ''Universities News'', 25 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and said the 10 Canadian universities that host CIs are compromising their integrity by allowing the Hanban to have a voice in academic matters such as curriculum and topics of class discussion, which constitutes a "fundamental violation of academic freedom."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caut.ca/news/2013/12/17/universities-and-colleges-urged-to-end-ties-with-confucius-institutes Universities and colleges urged to end ties with Confucius Institutes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820210709/http://www.caut.ca/news/2013/12/17/universities-and-colleges-urged-to-end-ties-with-confucius-institutes |date=2014-08-20 }}, Canadian Association of University Teachers, 17 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In June, 2014, the [[American Association of University Professors]] (AAUP) called on the almost 100 American universities that host Confucius Institutes to renegotiate their contracts with the Hanban.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial board, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-price-of-confucius-institutes/2014/06/21/4d7598f2-f7b6-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html The Price of Confucius Institutes], "[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]", 21 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The AAUP's Report on Academic Freedom&lt;ref&gt;AAUP Committee A on Academic Freedom and Tenure, [http://www.aaup.org/report/partnerships-foreign-governments-case-confucius-institutes On Partnerships with Foreign Governments: The Case of Confucius Institutes],  June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; stated, "Confucius Institutes function as an arm of the Chinese state and are allowed to ignore academic freedom."

A 21 June 2014 editorial in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' listed recent concerns about Confucius Institutes, including the AAUP advising universities to cut ties with them, alleged violations of freedom of speech and human rights, and the secrecy of undisclosed contracts between schools and the Hanban. It concluded that "academic freedom cannot have a price tag", and recommended that if universities will not publish their CI agreements, the programs should end.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-price-of-confucius-institutes/2014/06/21/4d7598f2-f7b6-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html The price of Confucius Institutes], The Washington Post, 21 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The official Chinese news agency Xinhua "hit back with an angry editorial" on 24 June,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weekinchina.com/2014/07/compulsory-education/ Compulsory education: A setback for Confucius], Week in China, 4 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; saying the claims by the AAUP and others that CIs "function as an arm of the Chinese state and are pushing political agendas", actually "expose not so much communist propaganda as their own intolerance of exotic cultures and biased preconceived notions to smear and isolate the CPC".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-06/24/c_133431220.htm China Voice: Fear, ignorance behind calls to stem Confucius Institutes], Xinhua, 23 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scandals involving Hanban's Director===
[[Xu Lin (Hanban)|Xu Lin]], the Director-General of Hanban and Chief Executive of the Confucius Institute Headquarters, caused two international scandals in 2014. In July, she ordered her staff to rip pages referring to Taiwanese academic institutions from the published program for the [[European Association for Chinese Studies]] conference in Portugal, claiming the materials were "contrary to Chinese regulations",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-10-07/china-s-soft-power-fail China's Soft-Power Fail], Bloomberg View, 07 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; which the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' described as the "bullying approach to academic freedom".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijings-propaganda-lessons-1407430440 Beijing's Propaganda Lessons: Confucius Institute officials are agents of Chinese censorship], The Wall Street Journal, 7 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In September, the [[University of Chicago]] closed their CI, blaming Xu's comments that her threatening letter and phone call forced the university to continue hosting the institute.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"&gt;[https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/09/26/chicago-severs-ties-chinese-government-funded-confucius-institute Chicago to Close Confucius Institute], Inside Higher Ed, 26 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Business Spectator]]'' concludes that the Xu Lin's hardline behavior highlights one of the biggest problems for Beijing’s charm offensive. "It still relies on officials like Xu, who still think and act like party ideologues who like to assert their authority and bully people into submission."&lt;ref name="Hard times for China's soft power"&gt;[http://www.businessspectator.com.au/article/2014/9/29/china/hard-times-chinas-soft-power Hard times for China's soft power], Business Spectator, 29 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Braga censorship incident====
On 22 July 2014, the evening before the start of the European Association of Chinese Studies (EACS) conference in [[Braga]], Portugal, Xu Lin censored four pages from the conference program and one page from the abstracts, which referred to Taiwan’s [[Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange]], a major sponsor of the conference for the past 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Cai, [http://www.businessspectator.com.au/article/2014/8/6/china/china-fails-soft-power-test China fails the soft-power test], [[Business Spectator]], 6 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://defence.pk/threads/china-hurts-taiwans-feelings-at-academic-conference-in-portugal.327507/ China hurts Taiwan's feelings at academic conference in Portugal], "Pakistan Defence" website, 4 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijings-propaganda-lessons-1407430440 Beijing's Propaganda Lessons: Confucius Institute officials are agents of Chinese censorship]", [[The Wall Street Journal]]", 7 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Diplomat [http://thediplomat.com/2014/08/the-undoing-of-chinas-soft-power/ The Undoing of China's Soft Power], "[[The Diplomat]]", 8 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shih Hsiu-chuan, [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/07/31/2003596335 EACS to protest Hanban’s academic meddling: source], ''[[Taipei Times]]'', 31 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201407280024.aspx China's obstruction at conference hurts cross-strait ties: Taiwan], Focus Taiwan News Channel, 28 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The EACS protested and reprinted all the deleted materials for distribution to all conference members. Roger Greatrex, president of the EACS, subsequently issued a report on the page deletions,&lt;ref&gt;Roger Greatrex, [http://www.chinesestudies.eu/index.php/432-report-the-deletion-of-pages-from-eacs-conference-materials-in-braga-july-2014 Report: The Deletion of Pages from EACS Conference materials in Braga (July 2014)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808055834/http://www.chinesestudies.eu/index.php/432-report-the-deletion-of-pages-from-eacs-conference-materials-in-braga-july-2014 |date=2014-08-08 }}, European Association for Chinese Studies, 1 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and an official letter of protest that concluded, "Such interference in the internal organization of the international conference of an independent and democratically organized non-profitable academic organization is totally unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Greatrex, [http://www.chinesestudies.eu/index.php/433-letter-of-protest-at-interference-in-eacs-conference-in-portugal-july-2014 Letter of Protest at Interference in EACS Conference in Portugal, July 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809004832/http://www.chinesestudies.eu/index.php/433-letter-of-protest-at-interference-in-eacs-conference-in-portugal-july-2014 |date=2014-08-09 }}, European Association for Chinese Studies, 1 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confucius China Studies Program (CCSP), which is administered by the Confucius Institute, was another major sponsor of the conference, and Sun Lam, director of the University of Minho Confucius Institute was a co-organizer of the conference.&lt;ref&gt;[[European Association for Chinese Studies]] conference 2014 website, [http://www.eacs2014.pt/braga/the-organisers The organisers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811015047/http://www.eacs2014.pt/braga/the-organisers |date=2014-08-11 }}, July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The CCSP international conference funding application states, "The conference is regulated by the laws and decrees of both China and the host country, and will not carry out any activities which are deemed to be adverse to the social order." Dr. Lam submitted a draft copy of the program to the CCSP, who subsequently approved the materials.

Conference registration began on 22 July 2014, and about 100 participants received complete copies of the abstracts and program, which comprised 89 pages plus cover and front matter. However, after Xu Lin arrived that evening, she proclaimed that mention of the CCSP sponsorship be removed from the Conference Abstracts, and ordered her entourage from Confucius Institute Headquarters to remove all conference materials and take them to the apartment of a local CI employee. When the remaining 300 participants arrived for conference registration on 23 July, they did not receive the printed abstracts or programs but only a brief summarized schedule. After last-minute negotiations between Xu Lin and conference organizers to ensure conference members received the program, a compromise was made to allow the removal of one abstract page that mentioned the CCSP support of the conference.

On the morning of 24 July, the remaining 300 conference participants received their materials, which were now missing four printed pages: the frontispiece mentioning CCSP sponsorship in the conference abstract, and three pages from the conference program. These expurgated pages contained information  the book exhibition and library donation organized by the Taiwan [[National Central Library]], and the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eacs2014.pt/ 20th Biennial Conference EACS Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810034320/http://www.eacs2014.pt/ |date=2014-08-10 }}, original version with the censored frontispiece and pages 15/16, 19/20, and 59/60.&lt;/ref&gt; The director of the National Central Library stated that EACS officials and members had spoken out against Xu during the opening ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taiwannpfnews.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&amp;mnum=112&amp;anum=14830 European Association for Chinese Studies Offers Formal Apologies to Us], National Policy Foundation, 29 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shih Hsiu-chuan, [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/07/29/2003596160 Foundation angry over EACS brochures], ''Taipei times'', 29 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall Sahlins explained that the EACS censorship brings to light the Hanban's seriousness in enforcing its contractual provisions "the way they do in China which is not so much by going to court ... but simply by fiat".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Redden, [https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/07/24/debate-renews-over-confucius-institutes Confucius Controversies], ''Inside Higher Ed'', 24 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Redden, [https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/08/06/accounts-confucius-institute-ordered-censorship-chinese-studies-conference Accounts of Confucius Institute-ordered censorship at Chinese studies conference], Inside Higher Ed, 6 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' said that the censorship has made more American, European, and Australian academics grow uneasy with CIs, and reported that when Ms. Xu met privately with foreign scholars in Shanghai, who asked specifically about the missing pages "she denied ordering them censored."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Marquand, [http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2014/0822/Academic-flap-turns-up-heat-on-China-s-Confucius-Institutes Academic flap turns up heat on China's Confucius Institutes], ''The Christian Science Monitor'', 22 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the [[BBC]] interviewed Xu Lin in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hys6MKkJw8Y |title=BBC News-The hard side of China's soft power |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the interviewer brought up the Braga incident, Xu Lin objected and later asked for large portions of the interview to be deleted. One of the points she made in the interview is that Taiwan [[Political status of Taiwan|belongs to China]], and therefore outsiders have no business interfering. The BBC did not agree to the censorship demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-30567743 |title=Confucius institute: The hard side of China's soft power - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Xu Lin not only refused to answer difficult questions, she also politicised the Confucius Institutes and reinforced the idea that they are led by dogmatists," commented Gary Rawnsley, professor of Public Diplomacy at [[Aberystwyth University]], Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rawnsley |first=Gary |url=http://wwwpdic.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/bbc-interview-with-xu-lin-about.html |title=Public Diplomacy and International Communications: BBC Interview with Xu Lin about Confucius Institutes |publisher=Dic.blogspot.co.uk |date=2014-12-22 |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported on Xu's BBC interview, and said, "Critics have argued that China’s Confucius Institutes pose a threat to academic freedom in the United States, Canada, Europe and beyond. Now the Beijing official in charge of them has confirmed it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/madam-xus-party-line-1419375797 Madam Xu’s Party Line, Beijing confirms that Confucius Institutes subvert Western academic freedom], Wall Street Journal, 23 December 2014 [behind paywall, copy here [http://fofg.org/2014/12/madam-xus-party-line/].&lt;/ref&gt;

====University of Chicago CI closure====
On 25 September 2014, the [[University of Chicago]] stated that it had suspended negotiations to renew its CI contract because "recently published comments about UChicago in an article about the director-general of Hanban are incompatible with a continued equal partnership."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2014/09/25/statement-confucius-institute-university-chicago |title=Statement on the Confucius Institute at the University of Chicago &amp;#124; UChicago News |publisher=News.uchicago.edu |date=2014-09-25 |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indirectly referred to Xu Lin's interview with the ''[[Jiefang Daily]]'', the official newspaper of the Communist Party in Shanghai, published on 19 September 2014,&lt;ref&gt;[http://newspaper.jfdaily.com/jfrb/html/2014-09/19/content_17605.htm 文化的困境, 在于不知不觉], Jiefang Daily, 19 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_9da15c960102v36w.html |title=许琳 王一：对话孔子学院掌门人：文化的困境,在于不知不觉_刘战生曰中_新浪博客 |publisher=Blog.sina.com.cn |date=2014-09-20 |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she claimed to have intimidated the president of the University of Chicago "with a single sentence", after 100 professors signed a petition to ban the Confucius Institute.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Xu Lin wrote a letter to Chicago's president and called the university representative in Beijing (where Chicago has a research center), "with only one line: 'If your school decides to withdraw, I will agree to it.' Her attitude made the other side anxious. The school quickly responded that it will continue to properly manage the Confucius Institute."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other media reports said Xu's comments: "brought panic" to the university, which was convinced by this "demeaning depiction" that an equal partnership was impossible;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/the-china-post/frank-ching/2014/10/01/418395/World-should.htm World should watch for Confucius], The China Post, 1 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; "could be construed as a boastful challenge";&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/analects/2014/09/confucius-institutes Confucius Institutes About-Face], The Economist, 26 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; "implied the school had kowtowed to the Chinese government";&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/university-of-chicago-cuts-ties-with-chinese-academic-center-1411773300 Wall Street Journal: University of Chicago Cuts Ties With Chinese Academic Center], Wall Street Journal, 27 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; or caused UChicago administrators to become "anxious" at the thought of shutting down the CI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thediplomat.com/2014/09/the-future-of-chinas-confucius-institutes/ The Future of China's Confucius Institutes], The Diplomat, 30 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the UChicago CI closure, the official Chinese ''[[People's Daily]]'' published "Rejecting Confucius Institutes not helpful to understand China" on 28 September 2014, but with two factual errors. First, closing the Confucius Institute does not mean "Chinese language study in the university would cease soon"; it means the university's Center for East Asian Studies will resume teaching Chinese. Second, without reference either to UChicago's statement, which specifically blamed Xu Lin's remarks, nor to the widespread media coverage of her ''Jiefang Daily'' interview, ''People's Daily'' said, "Though the university did not detail the reasons behind the suspension, many believed it was linked to the American Association of University Professors' boycott of CI."&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/n/2014/0928/c90780-8789083.html Rejecting Confucius Institutes not helpful to understand China], ''Peoples' Daily'', 28 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Xu's PR scandals occurred during the Hanban's international celebrations for the 10th anniversary of Confucius Institutes. The Australian ''[[Business Spectator]]'', describing the EACS incident as "highly damaging" for China's international image, said, "Xu’s hardline behaviour highlights one of the biggest problems for Beijing’s charm offensive. It still relies on officials like Xu, who still think and act like party ideologues who like to assert their authority and bully people into submission... [Xu Lin] has been a publicity disaster."&lt;ref name="Hard times for China's soft power"/&gt;

'''James Frederick Bonk''' (February 6, 1931 – March 15, 2013) was an American [[university]] [[professor]] noted for eschewing a research career in favor of teaching introductory [[chemistry]] courses for over 50 years, primarily at  [[Duke University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=News and Observer |url=http://blogs.newsobserver.com/campusnotes/fifty-years-of-chem-at-duke |title=Fifty years of chem at Duke |publisher=blogs.newsobserver.com |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2013-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320132648/http://blogs.newsobserver.com/campusnotes/fifty-years-of-chem-at-duke |archivedate=2013-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, also teach advanced and graduate courses, and wrote his own textbooks and laboratory manuals. His students fondly labeled his main chemistry class ''Bonkistry''.&lt;ref name="Ashley Yeager"&gt;{{cite web|author= Ashley Yeager |url=http://today.duke.edu/2013/03/bonkobit |title=Duke Flags Lowered: Longtime Duke Chemistry Professor James Bonk Dies &amp;#124; Duke Today |publisher=Today.duke.edu |date=1931-02-06 |accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedurhamnews.com/2009/10/07/199688/professor-finds-formula-for-satisfaction.html  Ferreri, Eric, ''Professor finds formula for satisfaction'', Durham Sun, Oct 07, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130412014002/http://www.thedurhamnews.com/2009/10/07/199688/professor-finds-formula-for-satisfaction.html |date=2013-04-12 }} accessed March 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Bonk obtained a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in Chemistry in 1953 from [[Carroll University|Carroll College]] ([[Waukesha, Wisconsin]]). He obtained a [[Ph.D.]] in chemistry in 1958 from [[Ohio State University]].

While a graduate student at Ohio State University, he received a DuPont Lecturing Fellowship that enabled him to teach there and to coordinate the teaching of introductory chemistry classes at OSUs  branch campuses. He also taught summers at [[Muskingum College]].

In 1959 he joined the Department of Chemistry at [[Duke University]] as an assistant professor and rose to the rank of full professor for his teaching skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com/obituaries/x145778984/March-17-2013 |title=James Bonk obituary |publisher=The Herald-Sun |date= |accessdate=2013-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320022345/http://www.heraldsun.com/obituaries/x145778984/March-17-2013 |archivedate=2013-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonk was known for his sense of humor. One oft-repeated story regarding him is that a group of students went out of town for a party and got back late, telling Bonk that they were delayed by a flat tire and thus missed an exam. Bonk reportedly told them they could take a makeup exam the next day. When they came for the makeup exam, the students were each put in a different room. The first question on the exam was reputedly a straightforward question worth 5 points. The story goes that the second question, on the next page, was worth 95 points and said "Which Tire?"&lt;ref name="Ashley Yeager"/&gt; This version of events is listed on [[Snopes.com]] as an embellished and unproveable story possibly based on a real incident, and the Snopes entry includes a 1996 letter to Snopes from Bonk stating that the story had been embellished;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Snopes.com|url=http://www.snopes.com/college/exam/flattire.asp | title= Tire Sum Excuse|publisher= Snopes.com|date= |accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonk reiterated in 2001 that the story had been embellished, and added that he would never place that much emphasis on a trick question.&lt;ref name=chronicle /&gt;

Bonk was also known for his love of tennis, and he played the sport throughout his life.  The Duke University tennis teams recognized his many years of service by officially naming Court Number 3 at Ambler Tennis Stadium as "Bonk Court" in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Duke Sports Information| url=http://www.goduke.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=4200&amp;ATCLID=205289913 |title=Men's Tennis Hosts Alumni Weekend |publisher=www.goduke.edu |date=2011-09-26 |accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This interest in sports and fitness came in handy when a student tried to [[pieing|hit his face with a pie]] in 1975.  Bonk frequently recounted the story of spryly leaping aside so that the pie got him in the shoulder, and then charging after the perpetrator, who ran out the classroom door and into the neighboring woods.&lt;ref name=chronicle&gt;{{cite web|author= Greg Pessin |url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2001/04/25/bonk |title=Bonk |publisher=''[[The Chronicle (Duke University)|The Chronicle]]''|date=2001-04-24 |accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonk's fitness allowed him to keep pace with the much younger student as they ran around in the woods until, in Bonk's words, "the young man made a tactical error by jumping down into a stream."  At that point he was no longer able to evade Bonk, who demanded his Duke University identification. The story was picked up by the Associated Press and garnered national attention.&lt;ref name=chronicle /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/55335678/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/18848436/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/3338493/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://newspaperarchive.com/us/california/oakland/oakland-tribune/1975/05-18/page-352&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life and death ==
Bonk was born February 6, 1931 in [[Menominee, Michigan]], the son of Joseph Frank Bonk and Beatrice (Colburn) Bonk. He died March 15, 2013 in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. A memorial service was held at Duke Chapel on March 21, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Duke University | url=http://today.duke.edu/2013/03/bonkmemorial#photo | title= Friends, Colleagues Remember Chemistry Professor James Bonk |publisher=today.duke.edu | date=2013-03-21| accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on March 21, 2013, his ashes were interred in the Sarah P. Duke Memorial Gardens on the Duke campus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/106748283 Dr James Frederick Bonk at Find A Grave]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kaunas University of Technology''' ('''KTU''') is a [[public university|public]] research [[university]] located in [[Kaunas]], [[Lithuania]].

Initially established on January 27, 1920, the school was known as "Higher Courses". With an increased rate of staffing and attendance, the school was instituted as the first independent higher education institution within Lithuania by the government on February 16, 1922. Renamed Vytautas Magnus in 1930, the university specialized in four areas: civil engineering, mechanics, electrical engineering, and chemical technology. The turmoil of [[World War II]] brought combinations of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]], then [[Nazi Germany|German]], and finally Soviet re-occupation, numerous name changes and an eventual closing of the university in 1943. After re-occupation by the Soviets in 1944, the University reopened and eventually reformed into Kaunas Polytechnic Institute (KPI) and Kaunas Medical Institute in 1946. Under the influence of [[Perestroika]], the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Lithuanian]] government reinstated the school's university status, and it was renamed the Kaunas University of Technology (KTU). Independence from the [[Soviet Union]] brought rapid westernization with a flexible module/credit system and membership to many [[Western Europe]]an organizations.

Since the establishment in 1922, the University has produced more than 125 000 graduates.
Following Lithuanian independence, KTU has issued over 1000 doctoral, and 62,000 bachelor's and master's degrees.

With a current academic staff of almost 3000 employees and nearly 17,000 students, KTU stands as the largest technical university in the Baltic States.

== History ==

===The Higher Courses===
Z. Žemaitis, a mathematician, and J. Vabalas-Gudaitis, a psychologist, with other intellectuals founded the first centre of studies in Kaunas – the Higher Courses. Among other subdivisions, the Courses included a technical section directed by engineer J. Šimoliūnas. The Higher Courses enjoyed successful growth and in two years they already had 480 students and 48 teachers.

On February 16, 1922 the government of Lithuania passed a resolution establishing the school as a university. The president of Lithuania A. Stulginskis appointed Dr. J. Šimkus as the first rector of the university with Monsignor [[J. Mačiulis-Maironis]] as the dean of Theology, [[A. Voldemaras]] as the dean of Social Sciences, [[Z. Žemaitis]] as the dean of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, [[P. Avižonis]] as the dean of Medicine, and [[P. Jodelė]] as the dean of technology.

===Vytautas Magnus University===
On June 7, 1930 the university was named Vytautas Magnus University. The university then consisted of seven faculties consisting of the Faculty of Theology and Philosophy, Faculty of Evangelical Theology, Faculty of Humanities, Faculty of Law, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Technology.

The beginning of 1940 saw the reorganization of Vytautas Magnus University with The Faculties of Law and Humanities being transferred to the University of Vilnius.

===World War II===
On August 21, 1940, with occupation by the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was instructed to rename school the University of [[Kaunas]]. In the fall of 1940 the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences was transferred to the University of Vilnius.

With German occupation in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://datos.kvb.lt/en/index.php?option=com_laikotarpiai&amp;task=view&amp;id=23&amp;Itemid=69 |title=Kaunas: dates and facts. Electronic directory |publisher=Datos.kvb.lt |date= |accessdate=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the university was once more renamed Vytautas Magnus University with 5 faculties: Theology, Philosophy, Technology, Civil Engineering and Mathematics. On March 17, 1943 the University was closed, along with other Lithuanian institutions of higher education.

On November 13, 1944 the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuanian SSR]] occupational government reopened the University, and until 1946 it operated under the name of Kaunas National Vytautas Magnus University.

===Kaunas Polytechnic Institute and Soviet Occupation===
In June 1949 the Faculty of History and Theology was closed.

In 1950 the University of Kaunas was reorganized into Kaunas Polytechnic Institute (KPI) and Kaunas Medical Institute. Throughout Soviet occupation, the KPI resisted attempts at [[Russification]] and internationalization and strove to preserve the old European university spirit, national academic traditions, and teaching in the [[Lithuanian language]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Kaunas University of Technology===
[[File:KTU, mokslo ir technologijų centras.JPG|thumb|upright|240px|Kaunas University of Technology Science and Technology Center]]
In 1990 KPI was named Kaunas University of Technology (KTU), regained its university status, and embarked on the road to reforms of studies and science.

In 1992 the university, in accordance with the Law on Science and Education of the Republic of Lithuania, started implementing a two-level degree program of higher education and a new procedure of awarding research degrees and academic titles.

In 1993 a Western flexible module and credit study system was implemented with emphasis on the unity of studies and science, broad fundamental education, liberal study programmes and independent study.

In 1998 the university joined Magna Charta of the European Universities and became a member of the European Universities Association and the [[International Association of Universities]].

[[File:Keelonga 1stgrade.jpg|thumb | 1st grade student at Soamanandray]]

'''Keelonga''' is an initiative started by Leila and Karim Pirbay in 2007. "Kilonga" means children in [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], the language of [[Madagascar]].

The goal of Keelonga is to make it easy for every child to get an elementary education in all rural areas in Madagascar.

To achieve this, Keelonga identifies and selects public elementary schools located in rural areas that are in obvious need of infrastructure repair and maintenance and/or with insufficient number of teachers. After discussing with the administration of the school and the students’ parents, an action plan is set.
&lt;ref name=kl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalschoolnet.org/gsncf/narrative_view.cfm?p|title=CyberFair: Project Narrative|website=www.globalschoolnet.org|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keelonga currently operates in rural areas around [[Antananarivo]], the capital city.&lt;ref name=kl/&gt; It has already successfully done heavy repairs in many schools. A few water wells have been dug in these schools to provide water and increase the awareness of children for hygiene.

Keelonga also provides teachers whenever necessary in order to maintain a ratio of students to teachers 50 to 1.

Actions for the future include more water wells, continue repair and maintenance work and start introducing some courses which are not available such as computer skills.

'''Kingston High School''' was a co-educational high school in [[Kingston, Tasmania]]. 

The school taught students in grades 7-10 and currently has approximately 700 students enrolled. The school is a six-stream school, with at least six class groups for each year level at the school.

The current Principal is Elizabeth Robinson.&lt;ref name="Leadership"&gt;[http://www.kingstonhigh.tased.edu.au/Management.htm Kingston High School Leadership]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Kingston High School was opened on Saturday December the 2nd 1972 by the then Minister for Education, [[Bill Neilson|Mr. Bill Neilson]].{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The school had an initial enrollment of 168 students, with students coming from the rural townships surrounding Kingston.

In 2000 student numbers peaked at 797 students, with enrollments steadily declining over the next six years. From 2007, numbers have been steadily growing again with the student population expected to continue to increase.

The school needed to relocate from the old Kingston CBD campus to the new Kingston View Drive campus at the beginning of the 2011 school year. The new school campus was opened on November the 4th 2011.

==Kingston Education Project==

Initial construction of the Kingston High School current campus was announced in 2007. The new campus is located in Kingston View Drive, on top of the old cemetery grounds bordering the Kingborough Sports Centre in western Kingston. &lt;ref name="KHS Brochure"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kingston High School - a new learning centre |publisher=Department of Education (Tasmania) |url=http://www.education.tas.gov.au/kingston/docs/Kingston_Education_Project_Brochure_Final_August_2007.PDF |accessdate=2009-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515040419/http://www.education.tas.gov.au/kingston/docs/Kingston_Education_Project_Brochure_Final_August_2007.PDF |archivedate=15 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction on the project commenced in May 2009.&lt;ref name="May 2009 Newsletter Part 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=KHS News May 2009 Part 1 |publisher=Kingston High School |url=http://www.kingstonhigh.tased.edu.au/Newsletters08_09/NewsletterMay2009%203_12.pdf |accessdate=2009-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913072100/http://www.kingstonhigh.tased.edu.au/Newsletters08_09/NewsletterMay2009%203_12.pdf |archivedate=13 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5675">'''Malgorzata Dubiel''' is a Polish mathematician and [[mathematics education|mathematics educator]] who works as a senior lecturer at [[Simon Fraser University]] in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, Canada]].{{r|sfu}}

==Education and career==
Dubiel is the daughter of a Polish military rocket scientist and engineer.{{r|macleans}}
She has a Ph.D. from the [[University of Warsaw]], supervised by [[theoretical computer science|theoretical computer scientist]] and [[mathematical logic]]ian [[Victor W. Marek]].{{r|mgp}} In 1982, she moved to Canada.

At Simon Fraser, her courses include classes for future mathematics teachers, and remedial mathematics classes for students who did poorly in high school mathematics.{{r|macleans}}
She was president of the Simon Fraser University Faculty Association for two terms from 1994 to 1996, and again from 2004 to 2005.{{r|pastpres}}

==Outreach==
Dubiel is known for her studies of Canadian primary and secondary school mathematics textbooks, and for pointing out problems in these texts caused in part because they were written by education professionals without consulting any mathematicians.{{r|errors|nss}} Although she values creativity imagination in mathematics, and uses it in her own lessons,{{r|3m}} she has also stated that it "must not come at the expense of basic math skills, clear instructions and practice".{{r|resistance}}

She has also served as president of the Canadian Math Education Study Group and co-chair in 2009 of the Canadian Mathematics Education Forum. She is the founder of an annual mathematics workshop for female graduate students in mathematics, Connecting Women in Mathematics Across Canada. She organizes the annual Changing the Culture conference for mathematics teachers at the [[Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences]], and is the creator of a series of exhibits and activities about mathematics in British Columbia shopping centers. She also leads multiple programs for high school mathematics.{{r|pouliot}}

==Recognition==
Dubiel became a [[3M Teaching Fellow|3M Canadian National Fellow for Teaching and Learning in Higher Education]] in 2008. The award citation noted her exceptional ability to instill mathematical confidence in entering students, her creative use of cartoons and fairy-tale stories to foster students' mathematical imagination, and her work publicizing mathematics and [[numeracy]] to the public.{{r|3m|macleans}}
She was the 2011 recipient of the [[Adrien Pouliot Award]] of the [[Canadian Mathematical Society]] for her contributions to mathematics education in Canada.{{r|pouliot}}
She also won a 2011 [[YWCA]] Women of Distinction award.{{r|pimsy}}

The '''Marshal Fahim National Defense University''' is located in the [[Qargha]] (or Qargheh) district of [[Kabul]] on a 105-acre site on a plateau to the west of the Kabul city centre near Police District 5. It  houses various educational establishments for the [[Afghan Armed Forces]].

There are three distinct parts to the university:
* the National Military Academy of Afghanistan (NMAA),
* the Afghan National Army Officer Academy (ANAOA), and
* the Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) Academy, which will include the Sergeant Major Academy.

The site will also house the ANA Foreign Language Institute.

==History of the military site at Qargha==
'''Geography''' The key to Qargha's historical importance is its geographical position. Qargha lies at the western extremity of Kabul, a low plateau dominated to the north and west by a crescent shaped range of hills. Even to the untrained eye, its strategic significance is obvious. To the south west the pass leading to Wardak, Ghazni and Kandahar forms a deep V shape cut into the mountains; to the west lie the Paghman mountains, the Paghman plateau and the road leading into the Hazarat; and to the north, beyond the ridge, the Kabul valley extends to Bagram, Charikor and the passes at Parwan and into the Panjshir Valley.

'''Ancient History''' The valley in which the university is situated has witnessed the passage of Afghanistan's invaders throughout recorded history, from [[Alexander the Great]] in 326BC to [[Genghis Khan]] in 1222 AD, followed by Tamerlane ([[Timur]]) in 1380 and [[Babur]] in 1504. On three separate occasions three hundred years later, the shepherds grazing their flocks on the hillsides would have seen the British advancing up the valley from the East, [[Robert Sale]] in 1839, [[George Pollock]] in 1842 and [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Frederick Roberts]] in 1879.

'''Modern History – The Royal Period''' The modern history of Qargha begins in the early 1880s, when [[Abdur Rahman Khan]], the founder of the regular Afghan Army, established a logistics base in Qargha to sustain is operations in the Hazarajat region. The camp was expanded considerably during the reign of Adbul Rahman's grandson, Emir [[Amānullāh Khān]] in the 1920s when he invited advisors from the Turkish and German Armies to train his Army in order to assert his newly won independence from British control. It became the home of the Kabul Division which was essentially the Emir’s strategic reserve. The camp performed this function until the time of the Soviet occupation in 1979.

'''Modern History – The Soviet Period''' The Soviet occupation of Qargha began in 1980. They too used the site as a logistics depot, digging ordnance storage bunkers into the northern hillside of the camp, many of which are still in use by the ANA. By the mid-1980s Qargha was occupied by around 12,000 troops, about half Soviet and half Afghan. Despite the huge number of troops on the site, the Mujahideen succeeded in launching an audacious infiltration attack which destroyed a large part of the ordnance depot with a spectacular explosion which could be heard across Kabul city. The attack caused several months of disruption to Soviet supply lines as they struggled to rebuild the depot.

'''Modern History – The Massoud Period''' The decision of [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] to move his [[Jowzjani]] militia out of Qargha to join [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]]’s coalition of warlords in the north and North East of the country contributed to the downfall of [[Mohammad Najibullah]]'s government. Massoud sited a number of Mujahideen troops at Qargha, and he was a frequent visitor to the site, staying in the commander's white house on the hillside, which is now known as 'Massoud House'.

'''Modern History – The Taliban Period''' Massoud's forces pulled out of Qargha in 1996. The installations left over from the Royal Army and Soviet periods made it an ideal site for the Taliban, who moved in and used it as a training and ordnance depot. They were still in occupation when American bombs rained down in during the Post 9/11 offensive in October 2001, obliterating most of the buildings.&lt;ref name="History of the Military in Qargha"&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Duncan|work=RMAS Military Historian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qargha today==
Qargha remained a bombed-out moonscape until the decision was made to make it the site of the planned Afghan National Defence University. American contractors moved in mid-2008 to clear the site, which previously served a variety of military roles since the [[Soviet–Afghan War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isaf.nato.int/article/news/cornerstone-laid-for-afghan-defense-university.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912142543/http://www.isaf.nato.int/article/news/cornerstone-laid-for-afghan-defense-university.html |archivedate=2014-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When building work is complete, the Qargha site will centralise the training of the majority of future [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] and [[non-commissioned officer]]s in the [[Afghan Armed Forces]]. Officer training currently takes place at both the ANDU site and east of the city at the [[Kabul Military Training Center]]. NMAA was previously located to the north of the city close to the [[Kabul International Airport]] but moved to the ANDU site in 2012.&lt;ref name="The Afghanistan National Army: Securing Afghanistan’s future by not repeating a failure of the past"&gt;{{cite web|last=Karimi|first=Sher Mohammad|title=General|url=http://www.afghanistan.gc.ca/canada-afghanistan/stories-reportages/2012_03_21a.aspx?lang=eng&amp;view=d|work=ANA Chief of General Staff|publisher=Canada's Engagement in Afghanistan|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cornerstone laying ceremony was conducted in April 2010 and the construction was completed in 2013. The total cost for the first phase of work was $200 million. Institutions that are located at ADU include the [[National Military Academy of Afghanistan]].

In April 2014, the university was renamed the Defence University of Marshal Fahim in honour of the former Vice President of Afghanistan, [[Mohammed Fahim]] who died of a heart attack on 9 March 2014. The ANDU has been commanded by Major General Jalinda Shah since May 2014.

==National Military Academy==
The [[National Military Academy of Afghanistan]] is modelled on the [[United States Military Academy]] and [[United States Air Force Academy]]. It is designed to train [[cadet]]s to produce well-educated and professional officers for each of the disciplines of the ANA and AAF. Schools include [[Armor]], [[Artillery]], [[Human resources|Human Resources]], [[Military communications|Signal]], [[Infantry]], [[Military engineering|Engineer]], [[Military law|Legal]], [[Military police|Military Police]], [[Logistics]], Religious/Cultural Affairs, [[Military intelligence|Intelligence]] and Finance.&lt;ref name="Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314152319/http://www.isaf.nato.int/images/stories/File/factsheets/1667-10_ANSF_LR_en2.pdf|publisher=North Atlantic Treaty Organisation |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NMAA moved to the ANDU site in Qargha on completion of its new campus in 2012. It was previously located in the old Air Academy [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|established by the Soviet Union]] to the north of Kabul beside Kabul International Airport.

NMAA cadets study both military and academic subjects for a total of 4 years and are awarded a degree from ANDU before commissioning into the ANA as Second Lieutenants.  Female cadets have studied at the NMAA since 2011 and the first intake of NMAA-trained female officers will graduate in 2015.

==Afghan National Army Officer Academy (ANAOA)==
The ANA Officer Academy is also referred to in Afghanistan as ANAOA and the Junior Officer Academy. It was reported as early as 2006 that the [[United Kingdom]] would take a primary role in the creation of an Officer Academy for the ANA and AAF. Nicknamed "Sandhurst in the Sand", the Academy was to be modelled on the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. This was supported by the then-head of the ANA, General [[Sher Mohammad Karimi]], who attended Sandhurst himself in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Afghanistan's 'Sandhurst in the sand' to bring square-bashing to Kabul"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hopkins|first=Nick|title=Mr|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/15/afghanistan-sandhurst-sand-kabul|accessdate=26 May 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March 2012 [[Secretary of State for Defence|UK Defence Secretary]] [[Philip Hammond]] met Afghan General [[Abdul Rahim Wardak]] and signed a statement of intent on developing the academy. The UK will provide approximately 75% of the training staff for the new Academy and will be involved in its running long after the 2014 deadline for pulling out the majority of troops.&lt;ref name="Defence Secretary visits Afghanistan and agrees new officer academy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hammond|first=Philip|title=UK Minister |url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/DefencePolicyAndBusiness/DefenceSecretaryVisitsAfghanistanAndAgreesNewOfficerAcademy.htm|publisher=UK Ministry of Defence|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghan officer cadets have been undertaking training at Sandhurst in recent years in order to improve the standard of officers in the ANA.

On 19 July 2012 on a visit to Kabul the British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the UK to provide mentors and advisors to the Afghan National Army Officer Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=790540982 |title=Afghan National Army Officer Academy agreement |publisher=Fco.gov.uk |date=2012-07-19 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand will also contribute support to the ANA Officer Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Danya Levy |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/middle-east/7267162/NZ-troops-evacuate-bombed-Afghan-police |title=NZ Troops Evacuate Afghan Bomb Attack Victims In... |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=2012-07-12 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in the Qargha area of Kabul, the first concrete steps were taken 10 Oct 12 to start the construction of the academy with a ground breaking ceremony attended by a number of dignitaries including the ANA Chief of General Staff General Shir Mohammad Karimi, Her Majesty's Ambassador to Afghanistan Sir Richard Stagg, ISAF Deputy Commander Lt. Gen. Adrian Bradshaw and Commander of the NATO Training Mission (NTM-A) Lt Gen Bolger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tolonews Website|url=http://www.tolonews.com/en/afghanistan/7915-construction-of-new-afghan-military-academy-begins-|publisher=Tolonews|accessdate=13 October 2012|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013183921/http://www.tolonews.com/en/afghanistan/7915-construction-of-new-afghan-military-academy-begins-|archivedate=13 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NTM-A&gt;{{cite web|title=NTM-A News Reports|url=http://ntm-a.com/archives/12097|publisher=NTM-A|accessdate=13 October 2012|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130924001342/http://ntm-a.com/archives/12097|archivedate=24 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ANA Officer Academy accepted its first intake of 270 students selected from approximately 10,000 initial applicants in October 2013. Training is being delivered by a staff of Afghan officers and soldiers in cooperation with a team of mentors from the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Afghan academy welcomes first officer cadets|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/news/25868.aspx#|publisher=British Army Website|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Loyn, David|title=Afghan officer academy opens its doors|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24629331|publisher=BBC News Website|date=27 October 2013|accessdate=27 February 2014|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ANA Officer Academy started recruiting its first intake of women in February 2014. Female staff will receive instructor training with their male colleagues, and they will be mentored by a coalition female mentoring team. Female candidates will attend a two-day selection test on the Qargha site in April 2014 and a platoon (balook) of 30 female officer cadets will start training alongside the third male intake in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wyatt, Caroline|title=Equality for women at Afghanistan's officer academy |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25763312|publisher=BBC News|date=28 January 2014|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sergeant Major Academy==
The Sergeant Major Academy is currently part of the Kabul Military Training Centre. It trains male and female soldiers at the rank of E7 [[staff sergeant]] in order to prepare them for service as Sergeant Majors at the ranks of E8 and E9 in the ANA and AAF. The Academy will move to the ANDU site in Qargha on completion of the Phase 2 build project.

==Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) Academy==
The Non-Commissioned Officer Academy will undertake training of soldiers from all disciplines up to the level of [[staff sergeant]].

==Defence Institute of Foreign Languages==
The Institute will deliver training in Foreign Languages for individuals posted into defence diplomacy billets.

The '''Mugar Omni Theater''' is a domed [[IMAX]] theater at the [[Museum of Science, Boston|Museum of Science]], in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mos.org/exhibits_shows/imax Museum of Science, Boston | Imax&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Mugar Omni is named after [[Stephen P. Mugar]], the founder of [[Star Market]], and his wife Marian G. Mugar. The Mugar Omni is non-profit and opened in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;.http://www.bigmoviezone.com/txshows/theaters/index.html?uniq=496&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 900,000 visitors came in its first year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whiteoakassoc.com/about/gallery/mugar.html White Oak Associates, Inc. - About Us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819003236/http://www.whiteoakassoc.com/about/gallery/mugar.html |date=2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the only domed IMAX theater in [[New England]] and is one of only 60 IMAX Theaters in the world to offer 180 degree domed viewing. The seats are set at a steep (cliff-side) angle and recline about thirty degrees, the screen is five stories tall, and the theater is filled with an impressive surround sound system. Because the screen fills a viewer's field of vision (including periphery vision) the screen and surround sound system give viewers the feeling of immersion and motion giving visitors a unique life like experience when viewing films. Viewers must turn their heads left to right up and down  to capture all that is going on. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostoncentral.com/activities/theater/p1247.php Mugar Omni IMAX Theater At Boston Museum of Science | Boston Central&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The theater only shows films of educational and scientific interest such as: ''Bears'', ''Beavers'', Amazing Caves'', Shackleton's Antarctic Adventure'' and more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homestead.com/stfdigcreektribe/files/htm/bms_omni.html Mugar Omni Theater at Boston's Museum of Science&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The average 70mm Omnimax film reel is around 3 miles long, weighs 200 pounds, and needs to be configured manually.

'''Nehale Senior Secondary School''' is a public school in [[Onayena Constituency|Onayena]], [[Oshikoto Region]], Namibia. Established in 1976, it is the second oldest school in the region but also in the entire former [[Ovamboland]]. Nehale SSS is named after [[Nehale Mpingana]], king of the [[Ondonga]]. The school is located at [[Onayena]], approximately 20 kilometres east of [[Ondangwa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=28&amp;tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=20971&amp;no_cache=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331214954/http://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=28&amp;tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=20971&amp;no_cache=1 |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has a history of exceptional performance with the highest pass rate in the region and the second best preferred school in the region after [[Oshigambo High School]].
Nehale Secondary School is also a cluster centre to the schools in [[Onayena Constituency|Onayena]].It is part of [[Onathinge]] education cluster. The school [[Head teacher|principal]] is Elifas Iimene.

==Current State==
The school was established during the colonial era and has not seen major renovations since then. The school obtains most of its funding from the government. This is generally not sufficient to cover running school expenses. Its facilities are thus dilapidated. A broken sewerage system, lack of accommodation for teachers, inadequate laboratory facilities and the lack of a hall are the major challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Northern school | last=Hilukilwa | first=Placido | newspaper = [[Namibian Sun]] | date=30 April 2012 | url=http://sun.com.na/content/national-news/northern-school}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable alumni==
The following people have attended or taught at Nehale Senior Secondary:
* [[Peya Mushelenga]], Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Namibia
* [[Johannes Nakwafila]], Namibian politician who served as [[SWAPO]] Party Councillor for [[Epembe Constituency]]

One of the most visible approaches to '''peer learning''' comes out of [[cognitive psychology]], and is applied within a "mainstream" [[education]]al framework: "Peer learning is an educational practice in which students interact with other students to attain educational goals."&lt;ref name="peer-learning-book"&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum
| isbn = 0805824480
| last = O'Donnell
| first = A. M.
|author2=A. King
| title = Cognitive perspectives on peer learning
| year = 1999
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it can be compared to the practices that go by the name [[cooperative learning]]. However, other contemporary views on peer learning relax the constraints, and position "'''peer-to-peer learning'''" as a mode of "learning for everyone, by everyone, about almost anything."&lt;ref name=dml-schmidt&gt;Jeff Brazil, May 23, 2011, [http://dmlcentral.net/blog/jeff-brazil/p2pu-learning-everyone-everyone-about-almost-anything P2PU: Learning for Everyone, by Everyone, about almost Anything]&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether it takes place in a [[Formal learning|formal]] or [[Informal learning|informal]] learning context, in small groups or [[Social peer-to-peer processes|online]], peer learning manifests aspects of [[self-organization]] that are mostly absent from [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] models of teaching and learning.

==Connections with other practices==
=== Constructivism===
In his 1916 book, [[Democracy and Education]], [[John Dewey]] wrote, “Education is not an affair of 'telling' and being told, but an active and constructive process.” In a later essay, entitled "Experience and Education",&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [http://ruby.fgcu.edu/courses/ndemers/colloquium/ExperiencEducationDewey.pdf Experience and Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey went into greater detail about the science of child development and developed the basic [[Constructivism (learning theory)|Constructivist]] theory that knowledge is created through experience, rather than passed down from teacher to student through rote memorization.  Soviet psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]], who developed the concept of the [[Zone of Proximal Development]], was another proponent of constructivist learning: his book, ''Thought and Language'', provides evidence that students learn better through collaborative, meaningful problem-solving activities than through solo exercises.

The three distinguishing features of constructivist theory are claims that:&lt;ref name=akhras-and-self&gt;{{Cite book
| chapter=Modeling the process, not the product, of learning
| last=Akhras
| first=F.N.
|author2=Self, J.A.
| editor=S.P. Lajoie
| title=Computers as cognitive tools, volume two: No more walls,
| pages=3–28
| year=2000
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Learning occurs within a context that is itself part of what is learned
* Knowing and doing cannot be separated
* Learning is a process that is extended over time
These are clearly meaningful propositions in a social context with sustained relationships, where people work on projects or tasks that are collaborative or otherwise shared.

Educational Psychology Professor Alison King explains in "Promoting Thinking Through Peer Learning"&lt;ref name=alisonking&gt;Alison King, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1477535?seq=4 Promoting Thinking Through Peer Learning]&lt;/ref&gt; that peer learning exercises as simple as having students explain concepts to one another are proof of social constructivism theory at work; the act of teaching another individual demands that students “clarify, elaborate on, and otherwise reconceptualize material.” Joss Winn, Senior Lecturer in Educational Research at University of Lincoln, proposes that schools radically redefine the teacher-student relationship to fit this constructivist theory of knowledge in his December 2011 paper, "Student as Producer".&lt;ref name=winn&gt;Joss Winn, [http://joss.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2011/01/28/pedagogy-technology-and-student-as-producer/ Student as Producer]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Rogers]]' "Personal Thoughts on Learning"&lt;ref name=carlrogers&gt;[http://www.panarchy.org/rogers/learning.html Carl Rogers' "Personal Thoughts on Learning"]&lt;/ref&gt; focus on the individual’s experience of effective learning, and eventually conclude that nearly the entire traditional educational structure is at odds with this experience. Self-discovered learning in a group that designates a facilitator is the “new approach” Rogers recommends for education.

In general, peer learning may adapt [[constructivist teaching methods|constructivist]] or [[discovery learning]] methods for the peer-to-peer context: however, peer learning typically manifests constructivist ideas in a more informal way, when [[learning]] and [[collaboration]] are simply applied to solve some real shared problem.

===Critical pedagogy===

[[Critical pedagogy]] engages students and instructors in analyzing and critiquing power structures around them. The most influential scholar in the development of this field was [[Paulo Freire]], whose book [[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]] described the traditional teaching framework as a “banking system” in which students are thought of as empty vessels to be filled with knowledge and concepts.  Instead, Freire advocated a more equitable relationship between teachers and students, one in which information is questioned and situated in political context, and all participants in the classroom work together to create knowledge.

Freire’s vision for dialogical education, where learning is situated within students’ lived experience, has been commonly deemed idealistic by modern educators.  Yet Paulo Blikstein, Assistant Professor of Education at Stanford University wrote in ''Travels in Troy with Freire: Technology as an Agent of Emancipation''&lt;ref name=troy&gt;[http://www.blikstein.com/paulo/documents/books/Blikstein-TravelsInTroyWithFreire.pdf Travels in Troy with Freire: Technology as an Agent of Emancipation]&lt;/ref&gt; that through exploratory building activities, “Not only did students become more autonomous and responsible, they learned to teach one another.”

=== Connectivism ===

[[Yochai Benkler]] explains how the now-ubiquitous computer helps us produce and process knowledge together with others in his book, [[The Wealth of Networks]]. [[George Siemens]] argues in [http://www.elearnspace.org/Articles/connectivism.htm Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age], that technology has changed the way we learn, explaining how it tends to complicate or expose the limitations of the learning theories of the past.  In practice, the ideas of connectivism developed in and alongside the then-new social formation, "[[massive open online course]]s" or MOOCs.

[[Connectivism]] proposes that the knowledge we can access by virtue of our connections with others is just as valuable as the information carried inside our minds. The learning process, therefore, is not entirely under an individual’s control—learning can happen outside ourselves, as if we are a member of a large organization where many people are continuously updating a shared database.

Rita Kop and Adrian Hill, in their critique of connectivism,&lt;ref name=connectivism-critique&gt;{{cite journal
| title=Connectivism: Learning theory of the future or vestige of the past?

| first = R.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that:
: it does not seem that connectivism’s contributions to the new paradigm warrant it being treated as a separate learning theory in and of its own right.  Connectivism, however, continues to play an important role in the development and emergence of new pedagogies, where control is shifting from the tutor to an increasingly more autonomous learner.

== Perspectives of other modern theorists ==

In a joint paper, Roy Williams, Regina Karousou, and Jenny Mackness argue that educational institutions should consider "emergent learning," in which learning arises from a self-organized group interaction, as a valuable component of education in the Digital Age.  Web 2.0 puts distributed individuals into a group setting where emergent learning can occur. However, deciding how to manage emergence is important; “fail-safe” management drives activity towards pre-determined outcomes, while “safe/fail experiments” steer away from negative outcomes while leaving space open for mistakes and innovation.&lt;ref name=williams&gt;{{Cite journal

| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams ''et al.'' also distinguish between the term “environment” as controlled, and “ecology” as free/open.

[[Cathy Davidson]] and [[David Theo Goldberg]] write in ''The Future of Learning Institutions in a Digital Age'' about the potential of “participatory learning,” and a new paradigm of education that is focused on mediated interactions between peers.
They argue that if institutions of higher learning could begin to value this type of learning, instead of simply trying to implement “Instructional Technology” in classrooms, they could transform old models of university education. Davidson and Goldberg introduce “Ten Principles for the Future of Learning,”  which include self-learning, horizontal structures, and open source education.  [[Peter Sloterdijk]]'s recent book "You Must Change Your Life" proposes similar ideas in the context of a "General Disciplinics" that would "counteract the atrophy of the educational system" by focusing on forms of learning that takes place through direct participation in the disciplines.&lt;ref name="Sloterdijk-change"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;156)

[[Yochai Benkler]] &amp; [[Helen Nissenbaum]] discuss implications for the realm of moral philosophy in their 2006 essay, 
"Commons-Based Peer Production and Virtue".&lt;ref name="benkler-and-nissenbaum"&gt;{{Cite journal

Joseph Corneli and Charles Jeffrey Danoff proposed the label “paragogy” to describe a collection of “best practices of effective peer learning.”&lt;ref name=paragogy-paper&gt;Joseph Corneli and Charles Jeffrey Danoff, [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:Arided/ParagogyPaper Paragogy: Synergizing individual and organizational learning]&lt;/ref&gt; They published a short book&lt;ref name="paragogy-book"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
along with several papers in which they discuss five "paragogical principles" that form the core of their proposed [[Learning theory (education)#Informal and post-modern theories|learning theory]].  These were generated by rethinking [[Malcolm Knowles]] principles of [[andragogy]] for a learning context that is co-created by the learners.

==Experiments==

The learning theories and approaches described above are currently being tested in peer-learning communities around the world, often adapting [[educational technology]] to support [[informal learning]], though results in formal learning contexts exist too.  For example, [[Eric Mazur]] and colleagues report on "Ten years of experience and results" with a teaching technique they call "[[Peer Instruction]]":

: Peer Instruction engages students during class through activities that require each student to apply the core concepts being presented, and then to explain those concepts to their fellow students.&lt;ref name=mazur&gt;{{Cite journal
| title=Peer instruction: Ten years of experience and results,
| last=Crouch
| first= C.H.
|author2=Mazur, E.

| year=2001
| doi=10.1119/1.1374249
| citeseerx=10.1.1.113.6060
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach made early use of a variant of the technique that is now known as the "[[flipped classroom]]":

: To free up class time for ConcepTests, and to prepare students better to apply the material during class, students are required to complete the reading on the topics to be covered before class.

[[P2PU|Peer 2 Peer University]], or P2PU, which was founded in 2009 by Philipp Schmidt and others, is an example from the informal learning side.  Speaking about the beginnings of P2PU, Schmidt echoes Siemens’ connectivism ideas and explains that, “The expertise is in the group. That’s the message, that everyone can bring something to the conversation.”&lt;ref name=dml-schmidt /&gt;  In numerous public talks, Schmidt argues that current educational models are "broken" (particularly on the basis of the high cost of university-level training).   He suggests that social assessment mechanisms similar to those applied in open-source software development can be applied to education.&lt;ref name="jps"&gt;{{Cite journal

Jeff Young’s article in the Chronicle of Higher Education, "When Professors Print Their Own Diplomas",&lt;ref name=young&gt;Jeff Young, Chronicle of Higher Education, [http://chronicle.com/article/When-Professors-Print-Their/1185/ When Professors Print Their Own Diplomas]&lt;/ref&gt; sparked a conversation about the necessity of formal degrees in an age when class lectures can be uploaded for free. The MIT Open Teaching initiative, for example, has since 2001 put all of its course materials online.  But [[David A. Wiley]], then Psychology Professor at Utah State, went further, signing certificates for whoever takes his class.  A similar practice has become even more visible in learning projects like [[Udacity]], [[Coursera]], and [[EdX]].  Although these projects attempt to "scale education" by distributing learning materials produced by experts (not classic examples of peer learning), they do frequently feature peer-to-peer discussions in forums or offline.&lt;ref name=anya&gt;Anya Kamenetz, [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/luncheon/2012/06/kamenetz Who can Learn Online, And How?]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the forward to a book on the ''Power of peer learning'' by Jean-H. Guilmette, Maureen O'Neil, then president of Canada's International Development Research Centre, states that
: Our experience has proven that [peer learning] is an efficient way to transmit knowledge across a wide range of groups or regions. Peer learning, based on jointly generated evidence, is also an effective means to build capacity and foster scientific excellence. The body of knowledge it generates is a powerful tool for the development of evidence-based policy.&lt;ref name=power-peer&gt;{{Cite book

| publisher = IDRC, Ottawa, ON, CA
| url = http://hdl.handle.net/10625/28624
| year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilmette suggests that peer learning is useful in the development context because
:It is my view that managing networks, especially those that are made up of sovereign nations, is fundamentally different from managing companies, organizations, or ministries that fall under a single authority. In essence, the dominant management approach for companies and institutions rests on cybernetics, with the view of keeping communications and accountability simple and clear. Managing methods that are successful in such a context [are] counterproductive when managing networks.

Guilmette cites Anne K. Bernard, who in a report based on extensive interviews, concludes:

: Effective networks act not simply on the basis of optimizing within constraints by attempting to force-fit predicted, linear and regulated programmes of work onto dynamic policy and client communities. Rather, they hone capacities and create mechanisms for the regular feedback and reflected analyses which are needed to deal with the ambiguity of these environments, and to adapt interactively with them.&lt;ref name=bernard&gt;{{Cite book

==Challenges==

[[Marlene Scardamalia|Scardamalia]] and [[Carl Bereiter|Bereiter]] explain in "Computer Support for Knowledge-Building Communities"&lt;ref name=s-and-b&gt;Scardamalia and Bereiter, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1466822 Computer Support for Knowledge-Building Communities]&lt;/ref&gt; that computers in the classroom have the opportunity to restructure the learning environment, but too often they are simply used to provide a digital version of a normal lesson or exam. They propose that classrooms be exchanged for “[[Knowledge building|knowledge-building communities]]” where students can use computers to connect to and create knowledge in the outside world.  However, as illustrated in citations above, this way of thinking about learning is often at odds with traditional educational praxis.

In "The Role of the Learning Platform in Student-Centered E-Learning", Kurliha, Miettinen, Nokelainen, and Tirri found a "difference in
learning outcomes based on the tools used."&lt;ref name=k-and-m&gt;J. Kurhila, M. Miettinen, P. Nokelainen, and H. Tirri, [http://cosco.hiit.fi/Articles/hiit-2004-10.pdf The Role of the Learning Platform in Student-Centered E-Learning]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the variables at work are not well understood, and are the subject of ongoing research.&lt;ref name=alpine-retreat&gt;Call for participation: Workshop at the Alpine Rendez-Vous 2013 January, 28 - February, 1st 2013 [http://engaged.hnlc.org/story_comments/list/18 It's About Time: Addressing the Many Challenges of Analyzing Multi-Scale Temporal Data]&lt;/ref&gt;   Within a formal education setting, a 1994 study found that students were more responsive to feedback from a teacher than they were to [[Peer feedback#Limitations|peer feedback]].  However, another later study showed that training in assessment techniques had a positive impact on individual student performance.

A classic study&lt;ref name=garbarino&gt;{{cite journal

Although other more recent work has shown that non-monetary rewards or acknowledgement can make a difference in ''performance'' (for certain populations of peer producers),&lt;ref name=barnstar&gt;{{cite journal

| pmid=22479610
| pmc=3315525
}}&lt;/ref&gt; the exact motivations for going out of the way to teach or tutor someone else are not clearly understood. As mentioned [[Peer Learning#Connections with Constructivism|above]], learning is often just part of solving a problem, so "peer learning" and "peer teaching" would tend to happen informally when people solve problems in groups.

==Peer learning in practice==
===Research on peer learning===

Research on peer learning may involve [[participant observation]], and may itself be [[Commons-Based Peer Production|peer produced]].  Some of this research falls under the broader umbrella of [[Scholarship of Teaching and Learning]].  [[Computer-supported collaborative learning]] is one obvious context in which to study peer learning, since in such settings "learning is observably and accountably embedded in collaborative activity."&lt;ref name=koschmann&gt;{{Cite journal
| last=Koschmann
| first=T.
| year=2001
| title=Revising the paradigms of instructional technology
| journal=Meeting at the Crossroads: 8th Annual Conference of the Australasian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education (ASCILITE)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, peer learning can play a role in settings where traditional conceptions of both "teaching" and "learning" do not apply, for instance, in [[peer review|academic peer review]], in [[organizational learning]], in development work, and in public health programmes.  Research in these areas may fall within the area of [[organizational studies|organization science]], [[science, technology and society]] (STS) or other fields.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6209">'''Philip Harry Cummings''' (1906-1991) was a world traveler, teacher of Modern Languages, and paid lecturer and news analyst. He was born and grew up in [[Hardwick, Vermont]]. He received a B.A. in Modern Languages from [[Rollins College]] in 1929, and an M.A. in Spanish from [[Middlebury College]], 1932. He began but did not complete a Ph.D. at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. One article from his research there was published in the professional journal ''Hispania''.&lt;ref&gt;"Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer as a Journalist: A Study in Particular of His Editorial Work in ''El Museo Universal'' during 1866," ''Hispania'', vol. 20, no. 1, February 1937, pp. 31-36. (There are multiple magazines called ''Hispania''; the ISSN number of this one is 0018-2133.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cummings was a great traveler and made sixteen transatlantic crossings between ages 19 and 29.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Billingsley, "Philip H. Cummings. Travel," http://philipcummings.net/travels.php, retrieved 2014-08-30&lt;/ref&gt; He is remembered as a remarkable (positive) character, the sort of man you never forget.&lt;ref&gt;See Eisenberg's introduction cited in the following note.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cummings sometimes wrote to important people, including the eminent Spanish scholar [[Miguel de Unamuno]], "cold" and was able to meet them. He was introduced to [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII, King of Spain]] at court and got to know the Spanish Royal Family and the Duke of Alba.

One of the most important episodes in Cummings's life was the ten days he spent with his friend and lover, Spanish poet and playwright [[Federico García Lorca]], in August 1929. The two met in Madrid in 1928 and spent another brief time together when Lorca was en route to New York in June 1929. At the conclusion of the [[Columbia University]] summer session of 1929, Lorca went by train to [[Burlington, Vermont]], and from there to the Cummings family's summer rental cottage in [[Eden Mills, Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;Introduction. ''Songs'', translated by Philip Cummings with the assistance of Federico García Lorca, edited and introduced by Daniel Eisenberg, Pittsburgh, Duquesne University Press, 1976, {{ISBN|039100414X}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that visit, Cummings translated Lorca's book ''[[Canciones]]'' (''Songs'') into English, with Lorca's advice on key points. This is the only translation of Lorca's work into any language in which he is known to have participated.&lt;ref&gt;''Songs'', translated by Philip Cummings with the assistance of Federico García Lorca, edited and introduced by Daniel Eisenberg, Pittsburgh, Duquesne University Press, 1976, {{ISBN|039100414X}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Lorca also wrote several poems that became part of his book ''[[Poet in New York|Poeta en Nueva York]]''.&lt;ref&gt;For details on these poems and their dates of composition, see Federico García Lorca, ''Poeta en Nueva York''. Primera edición del original con introducción y notas de Andrew A. Anderson, Barcelona, Galaxia Gutenberg, 2013, {{ISBN|9788415472872}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cummings and Lorca renewed their friendship in the fall of 1930 when Cummings returned to Madrid on a [[Institute of International Education|IIE]] fellowship. He returned to the United States abruptly the following spring on the advice of his IIE sponsors, just before Alfonso XIII left the throne. There is no evidence that Cummings ever saw Lorca again, although they may have continued to exchange letters.

Cummings claimed to have destroyed an autobiographical manuscript that Lorca left with him in 1929, but there is no independent evidence that the manuscript ever existed, and Cummings is far from a reliable source.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Eisenberg, ''"Poeta en Nueva York": Historia y problemas de un texto de Lorca'', Barcelona: Ariel, 1976, p. 181, n. 155; book archived at http://cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/01259079832031506098102/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of the Great Depression, Cummings was happy to get a job teaching Spanish, French, and German at the [[Valley Ranch School for Boys]] in [[Cody, Wyoming]]. He kept a detailed diary of his first year there. One portion, dealing with a school holiday visit to the South Dakota capital, [[Pierre, South Dakota|Pierre]], has been published,&lt;ref&gt;"Capital City Sojourn: The Pierre Journal of Philip H. Cummings, December 1932 to January 1933," edited and introduced by Patricia A. Billingsley, ''South Dakota History'', vol. 39, no. 2, Summer 2009, pp. 95-165.&lt;/ref&gt; and the rest is being prepared for publication. The school closed in 1934.

Starting in 1938, Cummings began a new career as a paid lecturer and news analyst. He was represented by various agencies; in the 1950s he was represented by the W. Colston Leigh agency of New York, Washington, and San Francisco, where he joined a roster of speakers that included such famous names as [[David Brinkley]], [[Vance Packard]], and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. Cummings's appeal as a lecturer was reflected in his billing as the agency's top repeat speaker on world affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Billingsley, "Career", http://philipcummings.net/career.php, retrieved 2014-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his home for many years in [[Woodstock, Vermont]].

[[File:Cropped Earth with Sunburst.PNG|thumb|A planetary or a Type I civilization is capable of consuming all of the incoming energy from its neighboring star, or about 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; watts for Earth.]]
A '''planetary civilization''' or '''global civilization''' is a civilization of Type I on [[Kardashev scale]], with energy consumption levels near that of a contemporary terrestrial civilization with an energy capability equivalent to the [[solar insolation]] on [[Earth]] (between 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; watts). In social aspect{{snd}} the worldwide, global, increasingly interconnected, international, highly technological society.

==Planetary civilization – Type I civilization on Kardashev scale==

{{Main|Kardashev scale}}
[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[astronomer]] [[Nikolai Kardashev]] in a work "Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations", published in 1964, proposed the scale of technological development of civilization, based on the amount of energy that civilization is able to utilize,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Kardashev| first =Nikolai| title=Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations| date = 1964 | journal=Soviet Astronomy | bibcode = 1964SvA.....8..217K | volume = 8 | page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; then named [[Kardashev scale]].

A Type I civilization is planetary, consuming all energy that is available from a neighboring star, or about 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; watts.
A Type II civilization is stellar, consuming all the energy that their star emits, or 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; watts. A type III civilization is galactic, consuming the energy of billions of stars, or about 10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt; watts.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaku|first=Michio|authorlink=Michio Kaku|title=[[Physics of the Future]]: How Science Will Shape Human Destiny And Our Daily Lives by the Year 2100|date=March 2011|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|isbn=978-0-385-53080-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Sagan]] suggested defining intermediate values (not considered in Kardashev's original scale) by [[interpolation|interpolating]] and [[extrapolation|extrapolating]], according to his calculations, the modern state of the present human civilization is expressed by a value about 0.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sagan |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Sagan |editor= Jerome Agel|others= [[Freeman J. Dyson]], David Morrison|title= Cosmic Connection: An Extraterrestrial Perspective |origyear= 1973|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lL57o9YB0mAC&amp;pg=PA156|accessdate= 2008-01-01|edition= |series= |date= October 2000|publisher= Cambridge Press |location= |language= |isbn= 0-521-78303-8|oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=I would suggest Type 1.0 as a civilization using 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; watts for interstellar communication; Type 1.1, 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; watts; Type 1.2, 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; watts, and so on. Our present civilization would be classed as something like Type 0.7.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition to a planetary civilization==

[[Theoretical physicist]] [[Michio Kaku]], in a book, ''[[Physics of the Future]]'', published in 2011, stated that humans with an average economic growth may attain planetary civilization status in 100 years.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
However, if we were to be able to exponentially increase our development, our planet may attain planetary civilisation status much sooner. This means we can see evidence of this everywhere we go. The [[internet]] is the beginning of planetary telecommunication system. The [[European Union]] is the beginning of a Type I economy. English will probably be the planetary language, as you can go anywhere on the planet Earth and the educated already speak English and are bi-lingual. Also, on the Internet, the number one language is English, followed by [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. A planetary culture is emerging, based on youth culture (hip-hop, rock, and youth fashion), movies (Hollywood blockbusters), high fashion (luxury goods). That same kind of culture, youth culture, the culture of the rich, is now going around the planet Earth.
You see the beginning of planetary sports, the [[Olympics]], soccer games. Realize that in the old days, you had competition between tribes. Now we have games not just between small provinces, but games that envelop the entire planet Earth. Innovation and discovery are changing the entire economic, political, and social landscape, overturning all the old cherished beliefs and prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/videos/the-birth-pangs-of-a-planetary-civilization|title=The Birth-Pangs of a Planetary Civilization  - Video|website=bigthink.com|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

{{quote|But where is all this technological change leading? Where is the final destination in this long voyage into science and technology?
The culmination of all these upheavals is the formation of planetary civilization, what physicists call a Type I civilization.
This transition is perhaps the greatest transition in history, marking a sharp departure from all civilizations of the past.
Every headline that dominates the news reflects, in some way, the birth pangs of the planetary civilization. Commerce, trade, culture, language, entertainment, leisure activities, and even war are all being revolutionized by the emergence of this planetary civilization.|[[Michio Kaku]], ''[[Physics of the Future]]'' }}

==Danger of a transition to a planetary civilization==

Michio Kaku, in his interview "Will Mankind Destroy Itself?"  with the website "[[Big Think]]" discusses a danger of a transition to a planetary civilization. The danger period is now, because we still have the savagery, but we also have [[nuclear weapon]]s:
{{quote|So whenever I open the newspaper every headline I see in the newspaper points to the birth pangs of a type one civilization information.  However, every time I open the newspaper I also see the opposite trend as well.  What is terrorism?  Terrorism in some sense is a reaction against the creation of a type one civilization.  Now most terrorists cannot articulate this.  They don’t even know what the hell I’m talking about, but what they’re reacting to is not modernism.  What they’re reacting to is the fact that we’re headed toward a multicultural tolerant scientific society and that is what they don’t want.  They don’t want science.  They want a theocracy.  They don’t want multiculturalism.  They want monoculturalism.  So instinctively they don’t like the march toward a type one civilization.  Now which tendency will win?  I don’t know, but I hope that we emerge as a type one civilization.  |[[Michio Kaku]], "Will Mankind Destroy Itself?", 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/videos/will-mankind-destroy-itself|title=Will Mankind Destroy Itself?  - Video|website=bigthink.com|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Planetary civilizations in science fiction==

Planetary civilizations are various civilizations we see in [[science fiction]]. Michio Kaku qualifies as one of a typical
Type I civilization would be that of [[Buck Rogers]] or [[Flash Gordon]], where an entire planet’s energy resources have been developed. They can control all planetary sources of energy, so
they might be able to control or modify the weather at will, harness the power of a hurricane,
or have cities on the oceans. Although they roam the heavens in rockets, their energy output is
still largely confined to a planet.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Next status – stellar civilization==

On the Kardashev scale, the next status is Type II civilization, where a civilization consumes all the energy that their star emits, or about 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; watts. Michio Kaku in a book "[[Physics of the Future]]" suggests that humans may attain stellar civilization status in a few thousand years.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Pop Culture Classroom''', based in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], is a nonprofit organization that educates in the areas of literacy and arts through alternative approaches to learning and character development. The organization creates educational programs for underserved youths, schools and communities by using comic books, graphic novels and related media to inspire passion for reading, art, and learning.

==Overview and history==
Pop Culture Classroom was founded in 2010 as Comic Book Classroom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pow! Comic Book Classroom project takes on illiteracy in metro schools|url=http://www.denverpost.com/theater/ci_18562585 |publisher=Denver Post|accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Colorado charitable organization focused on enhancing and improving student’s learning experience through the use of comic book media. At the same time, the founders of Comic Book Classroom also created the [[Denver Comic Con]] event. The Original Founders of Comic Book Classroom and Denver Comic Con are Charlie LaGreca, Frank Romero, David Vinson and Kevin Vinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://popcultureclassroom.org/about/history/|publisher=Pop Culture Classroom|accessdate=2014-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2010 and 2012, the Original Founders were joined by accomplished educators Illya Kowalchuk and Christina Angel, and experienced event organizers Michael Newman and Bruce Macintosh, who became an integral part of organizational development as the foundations of both Comic Book Classroom and Denver Comic Con educational programs were developed simultaneously.

The Classroom program debuted the first version of its “Storytelling Through Comics” curriculum to local area schools, and with the help of hundreds of dedicated volunteers and generous donations, the Denver Comic Con event became a reality on Father’s Day weekend, June 15, 2012. It was an unexpected and overwhelming success. The 2013 and 2014 Denver Comic Con’s built on that success.

Proceeds from Denver Comic Con fund the staffing, supplies and infrastructure of The Classroom program that promotes literacy through the medium of sequential art and storytelling. “Storytelling Through Comics” is a graphic literature creation program that is offered free of charge to schools, teachers and community organizations. The program currently offers students an educational experience that includes instruction in reading &amp; vocabulary, writing stories, and eventually the creation of the students’ own comics. Completed entries are then published in a class collection.

In 2014, the Comic Book Classroom Board of Directors voted to change the name to Pop Culture Classroom (PCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Wrap-Up: Denver Comic Con 2014! (Part 1)|url=http://popcultureclassroom.org/the-classroom/education-wrap-up-denver-comic-con-2014-part-1/|publisher=Pop Culture Classroom|accessdate=2014-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name change reflects the board’s broader vision for the organization. In addition to expanding the reach of our comic-based curriculum, PCC seeks to use other elements of pop culture to advance our mission of literacy education and to spark the creative spirit within every child.

==Need==
The need for literacy education in Colorado inspired the CBC program. High percentages of elementary and middle school-aged children in Colorado do not have or cannot afford after-school care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Need For After-School |url= http://www.afterschoolallstars.org/programs/need-for-after-school/|publisher=After-School All Stars|website=Afterschoolallstars.org|accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, several studies show that children who receive arts education often outperform children who do not in most educational areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Champions of Change: The Impact on the Art of Learning |url= http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/champions/pdfs/ChampsReport.pdf |publisher=The Arts Education Partnership|accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum==
Pop Culture Classroom’s “Storytelling Through Comics” curriculum is designed to educate 11- to 14-year-old students (grades 5-8) about literacy and the arts. The common core curriculum enhances students’ writing and reading abilities and artistic skills through an interactive educational experience focused around comic books and graphic novels. It can be offered as an after-school course, a stand-alone unit, or as a complement to an existing language arts curriculum in a classroom.

The six-week program is broken out into a series of distinct lesson modules:

•	The Joy of Reading: Students learn the terms associated with the creation, design and reading of comics and gain an understanding of the enjoyment and personal fulfillment associated with the medium.&lt;br&gt;
•	Visual &amp; Textual Storytelling: Students learn about storytelling arcs and define exposition, event, rising action, crisis, falling action and conclusion. Participants begin drafting their own short comic strip using the storytelling arc as a template.&lt;br&gt;
•	Dialogue: Students are introduced to dialogue as a narrative device and begin scripting their stories.&lt;br&gt;
•	Analyzing Conflict Resolution through Dialogue and Using an Outline: Students learn how dialogue reveals conflict and resolution in comics and learn the technique of reverse outlining to pace their stories.&lt;br&gt;
•	Basic Drawing for Comics: Students learn basic drawing techniques from a guest artist.&lt;br&gt;
•	Creating Comics and the “Author’s Chair” Celebration: Students finish their comic story using techniques taught in previous modules and celebrate their achievement.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The CBC curriculum is designed to meet the needs of early and challenged readers as well as students in more advanced stages of literacy. The curriculum includes dialogue around text and image, discussion and use of vocabulary and terminology. 
The larger goals of the curriculum are to teach literacy and arts engagement while fostering identity growth, positive peer relationships, communication skills, and community development among young people.

==Benefits==
Each local graduate receives a customized one-day ticket for themselves and a caregiver to [[Denver Comic Con]]. At the convention, graduates are welcomed as guests of honor. Additionally, they are given the chance to work with industry professionals in the Comic Book Classroom Corral, sell sketches to attendees, and further their understanding that popular culture has a valuable place in society and represents a viable career path. Graduates also receive a graduate package that includes the Denver Comic Con pass as well as a graduation certificate, custom CBC pencil, button, and sketchpad.

In addition, [[Denver Comic Con]] offers free admission to 200 educators annually during its Educator’s Day on Friday.

==Programming==
Pop Culture Classroom’s programming includes:

'''In-schools programs'''
*Trained volunteers facilitate the program in local schools as an after-school program, a stand-alone unit or as a complement to existing language arts classes or programs.

'''Online Resources'''

{{Psychology sidebar}}
'''Psychometrics''' is a field of study concerned with the theory and technique of [[psychological]] [[measurement]]. As defined by the [[National Council on Measurement in Education]] (NCME), psychometrics refers to psychological measurement. Generally, it refers to the field in psychology and education that is devoted to testing, measurement, assessment, and related activities.&lt;ref&gt;National Council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorP {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722194028/http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorP |date=2017-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field is concerned with the objective [[measurement]] of skills and knowledge, abilities, attitudes, [[Trait theory|personality traits]], and [[educational measurement|educational achievement]]. Some psychometric researchers focus on the construction and validation of assessment instruments such as [[questionnaire]]s, [[test (student assessment)|tests]], raters' judgments, and [[personality tests]]. Others focus on research relating to measurement theory (e.g., [[item response theory]]; [[intraclass correlation]]).

Practitioners are described as psychometricians. Psychometricians usually possess a specific qualification, and most are [[psychologists]] with advanced graduate training. In addition to traditional academic institutions, many psychometricians work for the government or in [[human resources]] departments. Others specialize as [[learning and development]] professionals.

== Historical foundation ==

Psychological testing has come from two streams of thought: the first, from [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Sir Francis Galton|Galton]], and [[James McKeen Cattell|Cattell]] on the measurement of individual differences, and the second, from [[J.E. Herbart|Herbart]], [[E.H. Weber|Weber]], [[Gustav Fechner|Fechner]], and [[Wundt]] and their psychophysical measurements of a similar construct. The second set of individuals and their research is what has led to the development of [[experimental psychology]], and standardized testing.&lt;ref name="Kaplan, R.M. 2010"&gt;Kaplan, R.M., &amp; Saccuzzo, D.P. (2010). ''Psychological Testing: Principles, Applications, and Issues.'' (8th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Victorian stream ===

Charles Darwin was the inspiration behind Sir Francis Galton who led to the creation of psychometrics. In 1859, Darwin published his book "[[The Origin of Species]]", which pertained to individual differences in animals. This book discussed how individual members in a [[species]] differ and how they possess characteristics that are more adaptive and successful or less adaptive and less successful. Those who are adaptive and successful are the ones that survive and give way to the next generation, who would be just as or more adaptive and successful. This idea, studied previously in animals, led to Galton's interest and study of human beings and how they differ one from another, and more importantly, how to measure those differences.

Galton wrote a book entitled "Hereditary Genius" about different characteristics that people possess and how those characteristics make them more "fit" than others. Today these differences, such as sensory and motor functioning (reaction time, visual acuity, and physical strength) are important domains of scientific psychology. Much of the early theoretical and applied work in psychometrics was undertaken in an attempt to measure [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]]. Galton, often referred to as "the father of psychometrics," devised and included mental tests among his [[anthropometric]] measures. James McKeen Cattell, who is considered a pioneer of psychometrics went on to extend Galton's work. Cattell also coined the term ''mental test'', and is responsible for the research and knowledge which ultimately led to the development of modern tests. (Kaplan &amp; Saccuzzo, 2010)

=== German stream ===

The origin of psychometrics also has connections to the related field of [[psychophysics]]. Around the same time that Darwin, Galton, and Cattell were making their discoveries, Herbart was also interested in "unlocking the mysteries of human consciousness" through the scientific method. (Kaplan &amp; Saccuzzo, 2010) Herbart was responsible for creating mathematical models of the mind, which were influential in educational practices in years to come.

E.H. Weber built upon Herbart's work and tried to prove the existence of a psychological threshold, saying that a minimum stimulus was necessary to activate a sensory system. After Weber, G.T. Fechner expanded upon the knowledge he gleaned from Herbart and Weber, to devise the law that the strength of a sensation grows as the logarithm of the stimulus intensity. A follower of Weber and Fechner, Wilhelm Wundt is credited with founding the science of psychology. It is Wundt's influence that paved the way for others to develop psychological testing.&lt;ref name="Kaplan, R.M. 2010" /&gt;

=== 20th century ===
The psychometrician [[L. L. Thurstone]], founder and first president of the Psychometric Society in 1936, developed and applied a theoretical approach to measurement referred to as the [[law of comparative judgment]], an approach that has close connections to the psychophysical theory of [[Ernst Heinrich Weber]] and [[Gustav Fechner]]. In addition, Spearman and Thurstone both made important contributions to the theory and application of [[factor analysis]], a statistical method developed and used extensively in psychometrics.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} In the late 1950s, [[Leopold Szondi]] made an historical and epistemological assessment of the impact of statistical thinking onto psychology during previous few decades: "in the last decades, the specifically psychological thinking has been almost completely suppressed and removed, and replaced by a statistical thinking. Precisely here we see the cancer of testology and testomania of today."&lt;ref&gt;[[Leopold Szondi]] (1960) ''Das zweite Buch: Lehrbuch der Experimentellen Triebdiagnostik''. Huber, Bern und Stuttgart, 2nd edition. Ch.27, From the Spanish translation, B)II ''Las condiciones estadisticas'', p.396. Quotation: {{quotation|el pensamiento psicologico especifico, en las ultima decadas, fue suprimido y eliminado casi totalmente, siendo sustituido por un pensamiento estadistico. Precisamente aqui vemos el cáncer de la testología y testomania de hoy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, psychometric theory has been applied in the measurement of [[wikt:personality|personality]], [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], and [[belief]]s, and [[academic achievement]].  Measurement of these unobservable phenomena is difficult, and much of the research and accumulated science in this discipline has been developed in an attempt to properly define and quantify such phenomena.  Critics, including practitioners in the [[physical sciences]] and [[Activism|social activists]], have argued that such definition and quantification is impossibly difficult, and that such measurements are often misused, such as with psychometric personality tests used in employment procedures:

: "For example, an employer wanting someone for a role requiring consistent attention to repetitive detail will probably not want to give that job to someone who is very creative and gets bored easily."&lt;ref&gt;Psychometric Assessments. ''[http://www.services.unimelb.edu.au/careers/student/interviews/test.html Psychometric Assessments .]'' University of Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures who made significant contributions to psychometrics include [[Karl Pearson]], [[Henry F. Kaiser]], [[Carl Brigham]], [[L. L. Thurstone]], [[Anne Anastasi]], [[Georg Rasch]], [[Eugene Galanter]], [[Johnson O'Connor]], [[Frederic M. Lord]], [[Ledyard R Tucker]], [[Arthur Jensen]], and [[David Andrich]].

== Definition of measurement in the social sciences ==
The definition of measurement in the social sciences has a long history.  A currently widespread definition, proposed by [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] (1946), is that measurement is "the assignment of numerals to objects or events according to some rule."  This definition was introduced in the paper in which Stevens proposed four [[levels of measurement]].  Although widely adopted, this definition differs in important respects from the more classical definition of measurement adopted in the physical sciences, namely that scientific measurement entails "the estimation or discovery of the ratio of some magnitude of a quantitative attribute to a unit of the same attribute" (p.&amp;nbsp;358)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Michell|first1=Joel|title=Quantitative science and the definition of measurement in psychology|journal=British Journal of Psychology|date=August 1997|volume=88|issue=3|pages=355–383|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1997.tb02641.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, Stevens's definition of measurement was put forward in response to the British Ferguson Committee, whose chair, A. Ferguson, was a physicist.  The committee was appointed in 1932 by the British Association for the Advancement of Science to investigate the possibility of quantitatively estimating sensory events.  Although its chair and other members were physicists, the committee also included several psychologists.  The committee's report highlighted the importance of the definition of measurement.  While Stevens's response was to propose a new definition, which has had considerable influence in the field, this was by no means the only response to the report.  Another, notably different, response was to accept the classical definition, as reflected in the following statement:

:Measurement in psychology and physics are in no sense different.  Physicists can measure when they can find the operations by which they may meet the necessary criteria; psychologists have but to do the same.  They need not worry about the mysterious differences between the meaning of measurement in the two sciences. (Reese, 1943, p. 49)

These divergent responses are reflected in alternative approaches to measurement.  For example, methods based on [[covariance matrix|covariance matrices]] are typically employed on the premise that numbers, such as raw scores derived from assessments, are measurements.  Such approaches implicitly entail Stevens's definition of measurement, which requires only that numbers are ''assigned'' according to some rule.  The main research task, then, is generally considered to be the discovery of associations between scores, and of factors posited to underlie such associations.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

On the other hand, when measurement models such as the [[Rasch model]] are employed, numbers are not assigned based on a rule.  Instead, in keeping with Reese's statement above, specific criteria for measurement are stated, and the goal is to construct procedures or operations that provide data that meet the relevant criteria. Measurements are estimated based on the models, and tests are conducted to ascertain whether the relevant criteria have been met.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Instruments and procedures ==
The first{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}psychometric instruments were designed to measure the concept of [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://examenpsicometrico.com/los-diferentes-tipos-de-tests-psicometricos/|title=Los diferentes tipos de tests psicometricos - examen psicometrico|website=examenpsicometrico.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One historical approach involved the [[Stanford-Binet IQ test]], developed originally by the French psychologist [[Alfred Binet]].  Intelligence tests are useful tools for various purposes.  An alternative conception of intelligence is that cognitive capacities within individuals are a manifestation of a general component, or [[general intelligence factor]], as well as cognitive capacity specific to a given domain.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Psychometrics is applied widely{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} in educational assessment to measure abilities in domains such as [[literacy|reading, writing]], and [[mathematics]].  The main approaches in applying tests in these domains have been [[classical test theory]] and the more recent [[Item Response Theory]] and [[Rasch model|Rasch]] measurement models.  These latter approaches permit joint scaling of persons and assessment items, which provides a basis for mapping of developmental continua by allowing descriptions of the skills displayed at various points along a continuum.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Another major focus in psychometrics has been on [[personality test]]ing.  There have been a range of theoretical approaches to conceptualizing and measuring personality.  Some of the better known instruments include the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]], the [[Big five personality traits|Five-Factor Model]] (or "Big 5") and tools such as [[Personality and Preference Inventory]] and the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]].  Attitudes have also been studied extensively using psychometric approaches.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  A common method in the measurement of attitudes is the use of the [[Likert scale]].  An alternative method involves the application of unfolding measurement models, the most general being the Hyperbolic Cosine Model (Andrich &amp; Luo, 1993).&lt;ref&gt;Andrich, D. &amp; Luo, G. (1993). A hyperbolic cosine latent trait model for unfolding dichotomous single-stimulus responses. Applied Psychological Measurement, 17, 253-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical approaches ==
Psychometricians have developed a number of different measurement theories.  These include [[classical test theory]] (CTT) and [[item response theory]] (IRT).&lt;ref&gt;Embretson, S.E., &amp; Reise, S.P. (2000). ''Item Response Theory for Psychologists''. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hambleton, R.K., &amp; Swaminathan, H. (1985). ''Item Response Theory: Principles and Applications.'' Boston: Kluwer-Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;  An approach which seems mathematically to be similar to IRT but also quite distinctive, in terms of its origins and features, is represented by the [[Rasch model]] for measurement.  The development of the Rasch model, and the broader class of models to which it belongs, was explicitly founded on requirements of measurement in the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Rasch, G. (1960/1980). ''Probabilistic models for some intelligence and attainment tests''. Copenhagen, Danish Institute for Educational Research, expanded edition (1980) with foreword and afterword by B.D. Wright. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychometricians have also developed methods for working with large matrices of correlations and covariances. Techniques in this general tradition include: [[factor analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, B.R. (2004). ''Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis: Understanding Concepts and Applications.'' American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; a method of determining the underlying dimensions of data; [[multidimensional scaling]],&lt;ref&gt;Davison, M.L. (1992). ''Multidimensional Scaling.'' Krieger.&lt;/ref&gt; a method for finding a simple representation for data with a large number of latent dimensions; and [[data clustering]], an approach to finding objects that are like each other. All these multivariate descriptive methods try to distill large amounts of data into simpler structures. More recently, [[structural equation modeling]]&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, D. (2008). ''Structural Equation Modeling: Foundations and Extensions'', 2nd ed. Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[path analysis (statistics)|path analysis]] represent more sophisticated approaches to working with large [[Covariance matrix|covariance matrices]]. These methods allow statistically sophisticated models to be fitted to data and tested to determine if they are adequate fits.

One of the main deficiencies in various factor analyses is a lack of consensus in cutting points for determining the number of latent factors. A usual procedure is to stop factoring when [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] drop below one because the original sphere shrinks. The lack of the cutting points concerns other multivariate methods, also.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

=== Key concepts ===
Key concepts in classical test theory are [[Reliability (psychometric)|reliability]] and [[Test validity|validity]]. A reliable measure is one that measures a construct consistently across time, individuals, and situations. A valid measure is one that measures what it is intended to measure. Reliability is necessary, but not sufficient, for validity.

Both reliability and validity can be assessed statistically. Consistency over repeated measures of the same test can be assessed with the Pearson correlation coefficient, and is often called ''test-retest reliability.''&lt;ref name="gifted.uconn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gifted.uconn.edu/Siegle/research/Instrument+Reliability+and+Validity/Reliability.htm|title=Home - Educational Research Basics by Del Siegle|website=www.gifted.uconn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly,  the equivalence of different versions of the same measure can be indexed by a [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation]], and is called ''equivalent forms reliability'' or a similar term.&lt;ref name="gifted.uconn" /&gt;

Internal consistency, which addresses the homogeneity of a single test form, may be assessed by correlating performance on two halves of a test, which is termed ''split-half reliability''; the value of this [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]] for two half-tests is adjusted with the [[Spearman–Brown prediction formula]] to correspond to the correlation between two full-length tests.&lt;ref name="gifted.uconn" /&gt;  Perhaps the most commonly used index of reliability is [[Cronbach's α]], which is equivalent to the [[mean]] of all possible split-half coefficients.  Other approaches include the [[intra-class correlation]], which is the ratio of variance of measurements of a given target to the variance of all targets.

There are a number of different forms of validity. Criterion-related validity can be assessed by correlating a measure with a criterion measure theoretically expected to be related. When the criterion measure is collected at the same time as the measure being validated the goal is to establish ''[[concurrent validity]]''; when the criterion is collected later the goal is to establish ''[[predictive validity]]''. A measure has ''[[construct validity]]'' if it is related to measures of other constructs as required by theory. ''[[Content validity]]'' is a demonstration that the items of a test do an adequate job of covering the domain being measured. In a personnel selection example, test content is based on a defined statement or set of statements of knowledge, skill, ability, or other characteristics obtained from a ''[[job analysis]]''.

[[Item response theory]] models the relationship between [[latent trait]]s and responses to test items. Among other advantages, IRT provides a basis for obtaining an estimate of the location of a test-taker on a given latent trait as well as the standard error of measurement of that location. For example, a university student's knowledge of history can be deduced from his or her score on a university test and then be compared reliably with a high school student's knowledge deduced from a less difficult test. Scores derived by classical test theory do not have this characteristic, and assessment of actual ability (rather than ability relative to other test-takers) must be assessed by comparing scores to those of a "norm group" randomly selected from the population. In fact, all measures derived from classical test theory are dependent on the sample tested, while, in principle, those derived from item response theory are not.

Many psychometricians are also concerned with finding and eliminating test [[bias]] from their psychological tests. Test bias is a form of systematic (i.e., non-random) error which leads to examinees from one demographic group having an unwarranted advantage over examinees from another demographic group.&lt;ref name="psycnet.apa.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|last2=Yoon|first2=Myeongsun|last3=Price|first3=Chris J.|title=Exploring the various interpretations of "test bias"|journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology|volume=20|pages=570–582|doi=10.1037/a0036503|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/a0036503|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to leading experts, test bias may cause differences in average scores across demographic groups, but differences in group scores are not sufficient evidence that test bias is actually present because the test could be measuring real differences among groups.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, C. R. (2000). Why is psychometric research on bias in mental testing so often ignored? ''Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 6'', 144-150. doi:10.1037/1076-8971.6.1.144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psycnet.apa.org"/&gt; Psychometricians use sophisticated scientific methods to search for test bias and eliminate it. Research shows that it is usually impossible for people reading a test item to accurately determine whether it is biased or not.&lt;ref&gt;Reschly, D. J. (1980) Psychological evidence in the ''Larry P.'' opinion: A case of right problem-wrong solution? ''School Psychology Review, 9'', 123-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standards of quality ==
The considerations of [[validity (statistics)|validity]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] typically are viewed as essential elements for determining the [[Quality (business)|quality]] of any test.  However, professional and practitioner associations frequently have placed these concerns within broader contexts when developing [[Standards organization|standards]] and making overall judgments about the quality of any test as a whole within a given context. A consideration of concern in many applied research settings is whether or not the metric of a given psychological inventory is meaningful or arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychology.tamu.edu/Faculty/blanton/bj.2006.arbitrary.pdf Blanton, H., &amp; Jaccard, J. (2006). Arbitrary metrics in psychology.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510182915/http://psychology.tamu.edu/Faculty/blanton/bj.2006.arbitrary.pdf |date=2006-05-10 }} ''American Psychologist, 61''(1), 27-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testing standards ===
In 2014, the American Educational Research Association (AERA), American Psychological Association (APA), and National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME) published a revision of the ''[[Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/science/standards.html#overview|title=The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing|website=http://www.apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes standards for test development, evaluation, and use.  The ''Standards'' cover essential topics in testing including validity, reliability/errors of measurement, and fairness in testing.  The book also establishes standards related to testing operations including test design and development, scores, scales, norms, score linking, cut scores, test administration, scoring, reporting, score interpretation, test documentation, and rights and responsibilities of test takers and test users.  Finally, the ''Standards'' cover topics related to testing applications, including [[Psychological testing|psychological testing and assessment]], workplace testing and [[Professional certification|credentialing]], [[Test (student assessment)|educational testing and assessment]], and testing in [[program evaluation]] and public policy.

=== Evaluation standards ===
In the field of [[evaluation]], and in particular [[educational evaluation]], the [[Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/ Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015044732/http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/ |date=2009-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has published three sets of standards for evaluations. ''The Personnel Evaluation Standards''&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. (1988). ''[http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/PERSTNDS-SUM.htm The Personnel Evaluation Standards: How to Assess Systems for Evaluating Educators.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051212001638/http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/PERSTNDS-SUM.htm |date=2005-12-12 }}'' Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1988, ''The Program Evaluation Standards'' (2nd edition)&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. (1994). ''[http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/PGMSTNDS-SUM.htm The Program Evaluation Standards, 2nd Edition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222025348/http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/PGMSTNDS-SUM.htm |date=2006-02-22 }}'' Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1994, and ''The Student Evaluation Standards''&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. (2003).  ''[http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/briefing/ses/ The Student Evaluation Standards: How to Improve Evaluations of Students.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524144621/http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/briefing/ses/ |date=2006-05-24 }}'' Newbury Park, CA: Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 2003.

Each publication presents and elaborates a set of standards for use in a variety of educational settings. The standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing and improving the identified form of evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;[{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2395969/Author_guidelines_for_reporting_scale_development_and_validation_results_in_the_Journal_of_the_Society_for_Social_Work_and_Research |title=Author guidelines for reporting scale development and validation results in the Journal of the Society for Social Work and Research]|author=E. Cabrera-Nguyen|work=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the standards has been placed in one of four fundamental categories to promote educational evaluations that are proper, useful, feasible, and accurate.  In these sets of standards, validity and reliability considerations are covered under the accuracy topic.  For example, the student accuracy standards help ensure that student evaluations will provide sound, accurate, and credible information about student learning and performance.

Psychometrics addresses ''human'' abilities, attitudes, traits and educational evolution. Notably, the study of behavior, mental processes and abilities of non-human ''animals'' is usually addressed by [[comparative psychology]], or with a continuum between non-human animals and the rest of animals by [[evolutionary psychology]]. Nonetheless there are some advocators for a more gradual transition between the approach taken for humans and the approach taken for (non-human) animals.&lt;ref name="Humphreys"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Humphreys, L.G.

The evaluation of abilities, traits and learning evolution of ''machines'' has been mostly unrelated to the case of humans and non-human animals, with specific approaches in the area of [[artificial intelligence]]. A more integrated approach, under the name of universal psychometrics, has also been proposed.&lt;ref name="upsycho"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=J. Hernández-Orallo |author2=D.L. Dowe |author3=M.V.

''Runar Søgaard'' (born 27 June 1967 in [[Kongsvinger]], [[Hedmark]], [[Norway]]) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] leadership trainer, life-coach and motivational speaker. He was earlier married to singer [[Carola Häggkvist]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Klanderud:[http://www.glomdalen.no/kultur/article3659748.ece Runar Søgaard gifter seg] (in Norwegian) Glomdalen.no, July 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2004 he created some reaction during a speech in [[Stockholm]], by saying that the [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad]] had been a [[pedophile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0,2789,633287,00.html Aftonbladet: "Runar går till attack mot islam"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050419083742/http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0,2789,633287,00.html |date=19 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to some condemnation and protests. During the same sermon he also made disparaging remarks about [[Jesus]] and [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta]]. Søgaard received threats from radical [[Islamists]]. Author and columnist [[Jan Guillou]] at the [[Aftonbladet]] news paper called for calm and wrote "it would be of great harm for Sweden's Muslims if Søgaard was harmed".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0,2789,638947,00.html Aftonbladet: "Runars martyrskap vore en skada för landets muslimer"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 his business Vinger Consulting AB was threatened with bankruptcy following a lawsuit by On Strategies LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carlsen|first=Carina Charlotte|title=Runar Søgaard trues med konkurs|url=http://www.na24.no/article3525730.ece|accessdate=7 December 2012|newspaper=NA24|date=05.12.12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hellberg|first=Magnus|title=Runar Sögaard krävs på pengar|url=http://www.expressen.se/noje/runar-sogaard-kravs-pa-pengar/|accessdate=7 December 2012|newspaper=[[Expressen]] |date=12 March 2012 |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, Søgaard was convicted for a third time of violating accounting laws, and sentenced by [[Nacka]] district court to two months of prison. Søgaard has declared he will appeal the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mogen |first=Trym |date=18 November 2014 |title=Kjendispastor Runar Søgaard dømt til fengsel |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2014/11/18/nyheter/runar_sogaard/sverige/36302411/ |newspaper=[[Dagbladet]] |location= |accessdate=18 November 2014 |language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1990 to 2000 Søgaard was married to the successful Swedish singer [[Carola Häggkvist]]. Together they have a son, Amadeus, born in 1998. He married for a second time in 2008 and has two sons in that marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vassbotten|first=Arve|title=Runar Søgaard ble pappa for tredje gang|url=http://www.seher.no/890054/runar-soegaard-ble-pappa-for-tredje-gang|accessdate=7 December 2012|newspaper=Seher|date=18 February 2012 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Søgaard is a good friend of [[Swedish people|Swedish]]-[[Nigeria]]n artist [[Dr. Alban]], retired footballer [[Thomas Brolin]] and table tennis player [[Jan-Ove Waldner]]. They are often seen together in [[Stockholm]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

'''SNAPI''' is a system that allows a user to record their preferences onto a [[smart card]] or other [[security token]].

When a card, [[mobile phone]], key fob token or similar portable object containing SNAPI data is put into public or share IT equipment, or moved into the field of the equipment’s sensor, it informs the [[computer terminal|terminal]] about the user’s preferred [[user interface]].  The terminal could be a shared [[personal computer]], a public [[interactive kiosk|kiosk]], a [[ticket machine]], a [[turnstile]] or an [[automated teller machine]] (ATM).  This can enable various [[accessibility]] modes such as a high-contrast [[display resolution|display]] or increased [[typeface]] size, audible prompts, increased time for responses for the duration of the transaction.  When the transaction is complete, the terminal returns to its [[default (computer science)|default]] settings.  The coding is specified in the European standard EN 1332-4. It has been supported by [[Lasseo]] to include SNAPI coding is included in various UK local authority smart card schemes

'''Southwest University of Political Science and Law''' ('''SWUPL''') is a national public university located in [[Chongqing]].

It was founded in 1953 with the original name '''Southwest College of Political Science and Law'''. It was one of the oldest Faculty of Political Science and Law after the People's Republic of China was established. Its law school ranks 3rd among all the law schools in China. Notable alumni include [[Liang Huixing]], [[Liang Zhiping]], [[He Weifang]], and [[Zhang Xinbao]].

Zhou Qiang, grade 1978 graduate from the Law Department of SWUPL, was elected president of the Supreme People's Court of China at the fifth plenary meeting of the first session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing on March 15, 2013.

==History==
As one of the oldest political science and law universities in China, Southwest University of Political Science and Law (SWUPL) developed from the Department of Political Science and Law at Southwest University of People’s Revolution which was founded in 1950, with Marshal Liu Bocheng as the university president.

In 1953, SWUPL was officially established through merging the Political Science and Law departments of Chongqing University and Sichuan University, the Law departments of Chongqing Finance and Economy College, and of Guizhou University and Yunnan University.

In 1978, the University was accredited as a key university by the State Council. In 2000, the administration of the University was transferred from the Ministry of Justice to the Chongqing municipality, thus creating a system of co-administration between the central and local government.

In 2003, it was approved as one of the first universities to grant doctoral degree of first-level legal discipline. In 2004, it established one post-doctorate mobile station of Law. In 2007, SWUPL was awarded as “excellent undergraduate education” by Ministry of Education.

In 2008, SWUPL became the key university co-administrated by Ministry of Education and Chongqing Municipality.

SWUPL became the first University in Chongqing co-administrated by the Ministry and Municipality. On October 24, 2012.

The University has three campuses, the main in Yubei, the other two in Shapingba and Baoshenghu, covering a total area of 3136.17 mu. There are 14 schools, including School of Civil and Commercial law, School of Economic Law, Law School, School of Administrative Law, School of International Law, School of Criminal investigation, School of Marxism, School of Juris Master, School of Management, School of Politics and Public Administration, School of Journalism and Communication, School of Foreign Languages, School of Applied Law, and School of Economics.

It offers 20 bachelor’s programs, 37 master’s programs of sub-disciplines, 4 professional master’s programs and 10 doctoral programs of sub-discipline, and 2 national key disciplines. The University has postdoctoral center for legal research and 6 provincial key bases for humanity and social science research. It has 1421 faculty and staff members, among which 1157 are full-time. It has 5159 postgraduates and 18591 undergraduates. The University’s library boasts a collection of more than 4,200,000 books.

SWUPL has international exchange programs with over 60 universities from U.S., United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Thailand, and South Korea. In 2014, SWUPL and Coventry University established China's only undergraduate Sino-UK English Law programme. SWUPL and University of Montana have also jointly established the first Confucius Institute in Northwest of U.S. In 2011, SWUPL and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) signed a cooperation agreement on the International Training Centre for local Authorities Project. The project, with a total of 100 million US dollars investment, will build training center in SWUPL and make full use of the training resources of the United Nations.

63 years since the foundation of the University, SWUPL has developed a multi-level and multi-type higher education for undergraduates, postgraduates, doctoral candidates, and international students, and has educated more than 200,000 high ranking specialized personnel. It is the university that provided the most law personnel for the country. A large number of alumni have become backbones and leading figures in law field and other professions.

'''Thinking Maps''' are a set of techniques used in [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]] ("K-12"). There are eight diagram types that are intended to correspond with eight different fundamental thinking processes. They are supposed to provide a common visual language to information structure, often employed when students take notes.

Thinking Maps are visual tools for learning, and include eight visual patterns each linked to a specific cognitive process. Teachers may apply Thinking Maps in all content areas and all grade levels. The eight map types are:
; [[Radial tree|Circle Map]]: used for defining in context
; [[Concept map|Bubble Map]]: used for describing with adjectives
; [[Flowchart|Flow Map]]: used for sequencing and ordering events
; [[Brace map|Brace Map]]: used for identifying part/whole relationships
; [[Tree structure|Tree Map]]: used for classifying or grouping
; [[Double bubble map|Double Bubble Map]]: used for comparing and contrasting
; [[Multi-flow map]]: used for analyzing causes and effects
; [[Bridge map]]: used for illustrating  analogies

By linking each thinking skill to a unique and dynamic visual representation, the language of Thinking Maps becomes a tool set for supporting effective instructional practice and improving student performance. Teachers and students, therefore, independently apply thinking skills for their own learning while also having a common visual language for cooperative learning. By having a rich language of visual maps based on thinking processes, learners are no longer confused by poorly organized brainstorming webs or an endless array of static graphic organizers. They are enabled to move from concrete to abstract concepts, think with depth, and directly apply their thinking to complex tasks.

== General information ==
Thinking Maps are a specific set of graphic Thinking organizers used in K-12 classroom settings, or "visual teaching tools that foster and encourage life-long learning," as well as tol that provide students with the skills to be "successful thinkers, problem solvers, [and] decision makers" (Thinking Maps Inc., Pamphlet).  Maps were founded as,"a good skill for the mind" quoted by Dr. Mark Davidson, scholarly teacher of accelerated classes. What he says is that the "one common instructional thread that binds together all teachers, from prekindergarten through postgraduate, is that they all teach the same thought processes" (Thinking Maps Inc., Pamphlet). For example, the thought process of classification might be taught in kindergarten by sorting or grouping, whereas classification in the upper grades might be taught as categorizing a main idea and details. Although we refer to classifying items, concepts, or ideas in different ways with different aged students, the thought process in its entirety is considered classification.

With this belief that all teachers, no matter the grade level, teach the same thought processes, these common set of visual organizers was created by Dr. David Hyerle as a type of language to be used across grade levels, content areas, and disciplines so that "students could learn more effectively and more efficiently." Thinking Maps were also created so that these graphic organizers would "become a familiar part of students' education that it would remain an effective learning tool throughout their academic careers – and beyond" (Thinking Maps Inc., Pamphlet).

== History of Thinking Maps ==
In 1970, Innovative Sciences, Inc. (ISI) was founded by Charles Adams in order to "improve the thinking and problem-solving abilities of the work force" (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011). Over the next eighteen years, ISI created a variety of developmentally appropriate materials, or "content-based thinking skills," for schools based on research from student reading performance and different educational teaching models (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011). In 1988, David Hyerle wrote Expand Your Thinking, which was the first resource where his Thinking Maps were published, and at that point, he began training educators to use his Thinking Maps (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011). In 1994, test results indicated that "Thinking Maps significantly affect[ed] standardized and qualitative measures of student performance" (Thinking Maps Inc., 2011). After more success and schools nationwide piloting Thinking Maps, ISI changed its name to Thinking Maps, Inc. in 2004 to "better promote its mission" (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011). Today, thousands of teachers across America have been trained in using and implementing Thinking Maps in their classrooms. Thinking Maps are also being promoted in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011).

== Educational theory and Thinking Maps ==
In his text ''Curriculum as Conversation'', Applebee (1996) states that a "curriculum provides domains for conversation, and the conversations that take place within those domains are the primary means for teaching and learning. Through such conversations, students will be helped to enter into culturally significant traditions of knowledge-in-action" (p.&amp;nbsp;37). When looking at Applebee's (1996) ideas of "knowledge-in-action" and social learning, a connection with Hyerle's Thinking Maps is apparent. When students produce Thinking Maps, conversations among the students and their Maps occur, which is where the real learning takes place. Students are able to "illustrate" and explain their thought processes through Maps, while other students listen, ask questions, agree and/or disagree. Social learning starts when the teacher realizes that his or her classroom needs to be based on a learning community of able and willing learners, where each student has a vital role in the everyday learning by participating and adding to the conversation, which is where Thinking Maps can aid, scaffold, and support.

Moffitt's theory of integrated language arts is widely seen through the use of Thinking Maps. Thinking Maps are products of reading, writing, listening, and speaking, and the aspects of listening and speaking are parts of the thinking processes that students use to explain themselves. Although the same eight Thinking Maps are used across grade levels, the Maps are developmentally appropriate for each age and coincide with Moffitt's developmental principle. In second grade, a teacher may use the Flow Map to sequence the stages and life cycle of a butterfly, while a high school chemistry teacher may use the same map to sequence the changing of an element from the periodic table. One teacher uses the map to illustrate a concrete idea, while another teacher uses the map to illustrate an abstract idea.

When looking at the overarching theories of education, Thinking Maps fall into the Postmodern Constructivism theory. In the Postmodern Constructivism theory of education, learners often use their prior experiences, and when using one of the eight fundamental thought processes and Thinking Maps, learners often do use their background knowledge to continue constructing new meaning and knowledge (Sherman, 2000). Students are also encouraged to create and form their own opinions after self-reflection and creating Thinking Maps, as well as to engage and discuss their individual maps with their peers, even if their ideas differ. Another aspect of the Postmodern Constructivism theory of education that is seen by the use of Thinking Maps is that they promote critical thinking and problem solving (Sherman, 2011).

== Research and rationales for using Thinking Maps ==
In his book ''Student Successes With Thinking Maps'', Dr. David Hyerle (2011) provides a plethora of reasons and research as to why Thinking Maps are beneficial tools for the classroom. Hyerle states that using the eight Thinking Maps promote metacognition and continuous cognitive development for students across their academic careers, as well as adds an artistic and kinesthetic component for students who learn effectively with that specific multiple intelligence (Hyerle, 2011). Lesson objectives can be covered in less time and with greater retention when using Thinking Maps, teachers can determine their students' background knowledge before teaching a unit or area of study, and student performance can be tracked over time in an accurate manner, too (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011). Through his research, Dr. Hyerle (2011) also found that Thinking Maps help close the achievement gap, as they "can help students [below grade level] self-regulate their own learning and be more successful in the game of school because Thinking Maps serve as a device for mediating thinking, listening, speaking, reading, writing, problem solving, and acquiring new knowledge." The thought processes that educators hope to instill in students are represented similarly throughout the curricula, and integrated thinking and learning across disciplines is promoted (Thinking Maps, Inc., 2011). As fidelity and accountability are also huge aspects in the education field, the idea that Thinking Maps as a school-wide initiative for use of a common instructional and learning tool and as a shared language among teachers and students is one of Hyerle's (2011) main ideas for the use of this support curriculum.

In Villalon and Calvo's (2011) ''Concept Maps as Cognitive Visualizations of Writing Assignments'', concept maps are discussed as a means of scaffolding university-aged students' ideas in writing, as well as their metacognitive skills. In their study, Villalon and Calvo evaluated a new Concept Map Mining tool, which was used in an "e-learning environment" that automatically generated maps using students' written work (p.&amp;nbsp;16). The Concept Map Mining tool was used to look at a collection of annotated essays written by undergraduate college students (p.&amp;nbsp;16). Villalon and Calvo (2011) found that "Cognitive Visualizations [such as Concept Map Mining] provide quality feedback because they make the author's thinking visible, making explicit the mental model learners are using…Within the writing process, providing automatic feedback in the form of [Cognitive Visualizations] allows learners to reflect on their own work and their own mental models that guided its construction, facilitating the development of metacognitive skills" (p.&amp;nbsp;23). Villalon and Calvo's (2011) study illustrates that the use of concept maps are beneficial to even the oldest of learners in a college setting, and although precise Thinking Maps were not used in this study, the idea of a graphic organizer to "map out" thought processes is universal.

In ''Thinking with Maps'', Elisabeth Camp (2007) investigates how individuals think and how thinking is related to language. Camp (2007) states that "…thinking in maps is substantively different from thinking in sentences" (p.&amp;nbsp;155). This concept supports Hyerle's (2011) idea that Thinking Maps possess an artistic and kinesthetic component, where students can feel free to express their ideas in a "drawing," or map, instead of using complete written sentences. Thinking Maps support learners who thrive with the artistic and kinesthetic multiple intelligences of learning.

David Hyerle (1996) reports numerous success stories with the use of Thinking Maps in his article ''Thinking Maps: Seeing is Understanding''. After teachers participated in a year-long professional development in the use and purpose of Thinking Maps, as well as integrated the maps into their curriculum during this training year, the "teachers agreed that the maps had successfully helped students develop their thinking processes and their ability to organize ideas, improved the quality and quantity of their writing, and also motivated them to learn. Further, the maps benefited the teachers by helping them organize content and assess student learning" (p.&amp;nbsp;88). Hyerle (1996) also reported that the educators who gave Thinking Maps the highest ratings at the end of the year were those who taught English Learners (Spanish-speaking students), as Thinking Maps "enabled their students to transfer patterns of thinking from Spanish into English, to focus on learning, and to build vocabulary" (p.&amp;nbsp;88).

In ''Designs of Concept Maps and Their Impacts on Readers' Performance in Memory and Reasoning While Reading'', Jeng-Yi Tzeng (2010) investigates the effect of Thinking Maps on students' performance of "cognitive operations." In the study, Tzeng had students read two opposing history articles that "argued from different perspectives about a historical incident" that occurred in Taiwan (p.&amp;nbsp;133). The results of the study indicated that the focus and design of the concept maps may "influence the formation of mental representations, and that this may be facilitative or constraining in regard to the readers' memory formation and reasoning about the reading materials." With regards to the maps' designs, Tzeng uncovered that this can impact a student's memory and/or understanding of a text, which poses as a negative aspect of the maps themselves.

In conclusion, by linking each thinking skill to a unique and dynamic visual representation, the language of Thinking Maps becomes a tool set for supporting effective instructional practice and improving student performance. Teachers and students, therefore, independently apply thinking skills for their own learning while also having a common visual language for cooperative learning. By having a rich language of visual maps based on thinking processes, learners are no longer confused by poorly organized brainstorming webs or an endless array of static graphic organizers. They are enabled to move from concrete to abstract concepts, think with depth, and directly apply their thinking to complex tasks.

August 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; founder Eren Bali built software for a live virtual classroom while living in [[Turkey]]. He saw potential in making the product free for everyone, and moved to [[Silicon Valley]] to found a company two years later. The site was launched by Bali, Oktay Caglar and [[Gagan Biyani]] in early 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udemy.com/u/erenbali/ Eren Bali biography]. ''Udemy.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, the founders tried to raise venture capital funding, but the idea failed to impress investors and they were rejected 30 times, according to Gagan Biyani.&lt;ref name=venturehacks/&gt; In response to this, they [[bootstrapping|bootstrapped]] the development of the product and launched Udemy—"The Academy of You"—in May 2010.&lt;ref name=venturehacks&gt;[http://venturehacks.com/articles/udemy How Udemy got oversubscribed].

Instructor compensation from tuition varies based on who invests in marketing to attract students to Udemy. Instructors earn 97% of all tuition revenues if the instructor's own reputation or marketing attracts the student. Udemy retains 50% of the earnings if the student is attracted by the site's own marketing or other coursework, and the instructor earns just 25% of the tuition if a Udemy promotional affiliate attracts the student to the site and course. In the latter case, the affiliate earns 50% of the tuition, and the remaining 50% is split between Udemy and the instructor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.udemy.com/teach/] udemy.com/teach ] ''Udemy Teach Page.''

'''Walden Flores Bello''' (born November 11, 1945) is a Filipino [[academic]], [[environmentalist]], and [[social worker]] who served as a member of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]]. He is a professor of sociology and [[public administration]] at the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]], as well as executive director of [[Focus on the Global South]]. 

==Early life==
Bello was born in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]. His family paid for his [[Jesuit]] schooling at [[Ateneo de Manila University]] and he attended [[grad school]] at [[Princeton University]]. While attending Princeton in the United States, he was introduced to the [[anti-war movement]] and led an occupation of the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs|Woodrow Wilson Center]]. The confrontation with police during these protests radicalized Bello and inspired him to pursue a life of activism. For his graduate studies, he traveled to Chile and stayed in shanty towns following [[Salvador Allende]]'s [[socialist]] rise to the presidency.&lt;ref name=Pstar&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramos Shahani|first1=Lila|title=The Kentex Fire: A Conversation with Walden Bello|url=http://www.philstar.com/opinion/2015/05/26/1458669/kentex-fire-conversation-walden-bello|accessdate=27 January 2016|work=philstar.com|agency=''[[The Philippine Star]]''|date=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he returned to the United States to defend his dissertation, he lost his ability to return to the Philippines after his passport had been revoked when the declaration of [[Martial Law]] by then-President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] on September 21, 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Professor, 2 others nabbed (2:29 p.m.) |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/net/2006/02/24/professor.2.others.nabbed.(2.29.p.m.).html |work= |publisher=Sun.Star |date=February 24, 2006|accessdate=2007-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Activism==
After earning his PhD in sociology in 1975 from Princeton, he then became part of the anti-Marcos movement, began teaching at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and became a member of the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=Pstar/&gt; In 1978 after being arrested multiple times during protests, he was arrested after leading the takeover of the Philippine consulate in San Francisco. Bello was later released following a [[hunger strike]] to bring attention to the situation the Philippines was facing.&lt;ref name=WBwebsite&gt;{{cite web|title=About Walden|url=http://www.waldenbello.org/about-walden/|website=Walden Bello|accessdate=27 January 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early-1980s, Bello also broke into the [[World Bank]] headquarters and stole 3,000 pages of confidential documents that he said would show the connection of the IMF and World Bank to Marcos.&lt;ref name=WBwebsite/&gt; He later wrote ''Development Debacle: the World Bank in the Philippines'' in 1982 surrounding the documents stating that this publication contributed toward the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] in the Philippines, with Bello returning to his native state two years later.&lt;ref name=Pstar/&gt;

In 1995, Bello co-founded [[Focus on the Global South]], a policy research institute based in [[Bangkok]], Thailand.&lt;ref name=WBwebsite/&gt; Bello had also led teach-ins during the [[1999 Seattle WTO protests]] and protested internationally against globalization at the [[2001 G8 summit]], the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2003|WTO Ministerial Conference of 2003]], the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2005|WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005]] and was banned from the 2006 World Bank-IMF Conference in Singapore.&lt;ref name=WBwebsite/&gt;

Politically, Bello began to turn away from the Communist Party of the Philippines after he heard that they allegedly killed individuals in the 1980s and 1990s that were accused of being [[double agent]]s.&lt;ref name=Pstar/&gt; Bello later joined the [[Akbayan Citizens' Action Party]] and became a member of congress in 2010.&lt;ref name=Pstar/&gt; In March 2015, Bello resigned his position in congress due to conflicts with President [[Benigno Aquino III]] that surrounded the Disbursement Acceleration Program and the [[Mamasapano incident]]. He ran for senator in 2016 but lost.&lt;ref name=RAPPLER&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aceron|first1=Joy|last2=Isaac|first2=Francis|title=That thing called resignation|url=http://www.rappler.com/views/imho/86797-walden-bello-resignation|accessdate=27 January 2016|work=[[Rappler]]|date=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==
''[[Socialist Worker]]'' described Bello as "one of the most articulate and prolific voices on the international left" and that "he has devoted most of his life to fighting [[imperialism]] and corporate globalization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Walden Bello needs your support|url=http://socialistworker.org/2005-1/532/532_07_WaldenBello.shtml|website=socialistworker.org|publisher=''[[Socialist Worker]]''|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bello was also a supporter of [[Hugo Chávez]] and was impressed by his opposition to the United States, stating after Chávez's death that he was "a class act, one impossible to follow. Wherever you are right now, give ’em hell".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bello|first1=Walden|title=I’ll miss Hugo|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/48265/ill-miss-hugo|accessdate=27 January 2016|agency=''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]''|date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
