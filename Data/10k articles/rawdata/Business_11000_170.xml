The '''1993 Cherbourg incident''' were a series of maritime incidents which took place from 26 March to 2 April 1993 between the British [[Royal Navy]] and French fishermen as a result of a [[Exclusive economic zone|fishing rights]] dispute in and around the [[Channel Islands]] waters.

== Background ==

The tensions around the Channel Islands waters rose high since September 1992, when the [[European Union]] (EU) recognised a six-mile British limit for [[Exclusive Economic Zone|exclusive fishing rights]] around the islands. Until then, British and French trawlers operated in the zone without restrictions.&lt;ref name=burn/&gt; The agreement left a three-mile limit from the coastline where only [[Jersey]] trawlers could fish, between the three-mile and the six-mile for any British-flagged boat and an outer area between the six-mile and the 12-mile limit where only British and French fishing boats could operate.&lt;ref name=surv/&gt;

== The incidents ==

The first incident took place on 26 March, when two fishing inspectors from the Channel Islands were illegally taken on the trawler ''Impatiens'' to the French port of [[Barneville-Carteret]], after the French fishing boat was challenged by the British fishery vessel [[HMS Orkney (P299)|HMS ''Orkney'']] from [[Guernsey]],&lt;ref name=day/&gt; which confiscated her pots.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The inspectors were rescued some hours later by a French coastguard vessel.&lt;ref name=surv&gt;British Information Services: Survey of current affairs: Volumen 23, 1993, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=day&gt;Daily report. West Europe, 1–15. United States. [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 March 1993, [[HMS Blazer (P279)|HMS ''Blazer'']] was paying a visit to [[Cherbourg]] when the local fishermen learned that a boat from their fleet, the ''La Calypso'', had been stopped at sea by a British minesweeper, [[HMS Brocklesby (M33)|HMS ''Brocklesby'']]. The captain of the ''La Calypso'' refused to submit and set out for Cherbourg with three British fishery protection servicemen on board. A French port vessel later returned the personnel to Royal Navy control. Eight French trawlers subsequently surrounded the ''Blazer''&lt;ref name=burn/&gt; at 3:00 pm and angry fishermen boarded the ship. According to witnesses,&lt;ref name=day/&gt; HMS ''Blazer'' was seized while manoeuvring outside the port and sailed to Cherbourg harbour by the intruders. Her crew of 16 were forced to remain below the deck for three hours, while the ship's [[White Ensign]]  was burned.  French authorities subsequently put an end to the situation and forcibly expelled the fishermen from ''Blazer'' and placed them under arrest. The [[French Navy]], meanwhile, dispatched the patrol boat ''Coriander'' to Cherbourg.&lt;ref name=burn&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/french-fishermen-burn-patrol-boats-ensign-minister-warns-navy-will-get-tough-after-two-new-humiliations-in-fishing-rights-dispute-1500601.html "French fishermen burn patrol boat's ensign: Minister warns Navy will get tough after two new humiliations in fishing rights dispute"]. ''The Independent'', 29 March 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 March a flotilla of 36 French trawlers steamed up to [[Saint Peter Port]] in Guernsey, where a preliminary deal was agreed.&lt;ref name=surv/&gt; After the first incidents, the Royal Navy deployed unarmed [[Royal Marines]] to conduct any future similar law enforcement operations. The marines were from 40 Commando, based at [[Taunton]] in Somerset. The ''La Calypso'' was eventually caught by the fishery vessel [[HMS Jersey (P295)|HMS ''Jersey'']] and her master was put under arrest in Guernsey on 2 April 1993.&lt;ref name=skip&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/french-skipper-under-arrest-in-guernsey-1453007.html "French skipper under arrest in Guernsey "]. ''The Independent'', 3 April 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The skipper, Michel Mesnage, was released on bail on 3 April.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/guernsey-bails-fish-feud-skipper-1453328.html "Guernsey bails fish feud skipper"]. ''The Independent'', 4 April 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; A new incident took place on 30 June 1993, when the Guernsey-based trawler ''Sara P'' was seized by the French Navy, and had her pots confiscated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== British and French reactions ==

A spokeswoman for the French fishermen accused the Royal Navy of "severe provocation", while the British [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|minister of Agriculture]], [[John Gummer]], stated that "The rule of law must be upheld. I have always emphasised the need for fisheries regulations to be properly enforced throughout the EC. The regulations are there to conserve fish and the long-term interests of the fishermen themselves."&lt;ref name=skip/&gt; The British Fisheries junior Minister, [[David Curry]], claimed that the conflict was caused by the French authorities' failure to properly inform their fishermen about the agreement sanctioned by the EU in 1992, and the [[French legislative election, 1993|French legislative election]], which in practice left no French government to deal with at the time of the incidents.&lt;ref name=surv/&gt; The British Agriculture Minister had met his elected French counterpart on 1 April, and they had agreed that the 1992 EU decision should be enforced.&lt;ref name=skip/&gt; The French government condemned the fishermen's actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-03-30/news/1993089075_1_british-channel-islands-french-fishermen-british-and-french Seizing of British officers by French fishing boat sends chill across channel] by Richard O'Mara. [[The Baltimore Sun]], 30 March 1993&lt;/ref&gt; British and Cherbourg fishermen signed an informal agreement on 5 April, on the first day since the beginning of the crisis, that boats from England and the islands were allowed to unload their catch in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/fishermen-make-pact-friendly-overtures-as-british-catch-is-unloaded-in-france-1453579.html|title=Fishermen make 'pact': Friendly overtures as British catch is unloaded|date=1993-04-06|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A definitive agreement regarding fishing around the Channel Islands and the [[Contentin]] peninsula and [[Brittany]] was reached after an exchange of notes in Paris, on 16 August 1994.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://treaties.fco.gov.uk/docs/pdf/1995/TS0037.pdf|title = Exchange of notes constituting an agreement regarding activities by the local coastal fishermen in the vicinity of Guernsey and the French coasts of the Cotentin Peninsula and of Brittany.

'''AZCA''', an acronym for '''''Asociación Mixta de Compensación de la Manzana A de la Zona Comercial de la Avenida del Generalísimo''''' ("Mixed Association for Compensation of the A Block of the Commercial Area of the Avenue of the [[Francisco Franco|Generalisimo]]", now called the Avenue of [[Paseo de la Castellana]]), is a [[Central business district|financial district]] in downtown [[Madrid]], Spain.

==History==
It is located between the streets Raimundo Fernández Villaverde, Orense, General Perón and Paseo de la Castellana. Its original conception (and its name) dates back to the ''Plan General de Ordenación Urbana de Madrid'' ([[PGOU]]), approved in 1946. The purpose of this plan was to create a huge block of modern office buildings with metro and railway connections in the expansion area of northern Madrid, just in front of Real Madrid stadium (currently named the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium]]) and beside the new government complex of [[Nuevos Ministerios]]. A botanical garden, a library and an opera house were also included in the plans, but these were never built.

The construction began in the 1970s after many delays. Nowadays some of the tallest and most beautiful modern Madrid skyscrapers are placed here. The most important are:

* [[Torre Picasso]] (157&amp;nbsp;m)
* [[Torre Europa (Madrid)|Torre Europa]] (121&amp;nbsp;m)
* [[Castellana 81|Banco de Bilbao Tower]] (107&amp;nbsp;m)
* [[Torre Titania]] (104&amp;nbsp;m)
* [[Torre Mahou]] (100&amp;nbsp;m)

In February 2005, [[Windsor Tower]] (106&amp;nbsp;m) was destroyed by a fire, and it was later replaced by Torre Titania.

During the weekend nights, the underground levels attract a Latino audience to the discos but they also have a reputation for gang violence.&lt;ref name="El Mundo"&gt;''[http://www.elmundo.es/papel/2006/02/07/madrid/1926910_impresora.html Que la violencia no vuelva a Azca]'', ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', 7 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a [[Cuatro Torres Business Area|new skycraper area]] was built farther north along [[Paseo de la Castellana]].

'''Al Ries''' is a [[marketing]] professional and author. He is also the cofounder and chairman of the Atlanta-based [[Consultant|consulting]] firm Ries &amp; Ries with his partner and daughter, [[Laura Ries]].  Along with [[Jack Trout]], Ries is crediting with coining the term "[[Positioning (marketing)|positioning]]", as related to the field of marketing,&lt;ref name="Brand Strategy Insider"&gt;{{cite web |title=Brand Strategy Insider |url=http://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com/2007/08/great-moments-2-5.html#.VvAOpnra1aY|publisher=The Blake Project |accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ries|first=Al|last2=Trout|first2=Jack|date=April 1972|title=The Positioning Era Cometh|url=http://www.ries.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Positioning-Articles002.pdf|journal=Advertising Age|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and authored ''Positioning: The Battle For Your Mind'', an industry standard on the subject.

Ries graduated from [[DePauw University]] in 1950 with a degree in [[liberal arts]] and accepted a position with the advertising department of [[General Electric]] before founding his own advertising agency in [[New York City]], Ries Cappiello Colwell, in 1963. The agency later changed to a marketing strategy firm, Trout &amp; Ries.

In 1972, again cooperating with Trout, Ries co-authored a three-part series of articles declaring the arrival of the "Positioning Era" in ''[[Advertising Age]]'' magazine, promoting their concept of positioning.

In 1994, Ries founded Ries &amp; Ries with his daughter Laura a recent graduate of [[Northwestern University]] and TBWA advertising account executive.

Ries was selected as one of the most influential people in the field of [[public relations]] in the 20th century by ''[[PR Week]]'' magazine in 1999. Ries has also written a number of books that have made the  ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' best seller list &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1999/02/b3611179.htm |title=The Business Week Best-Seller List |date=1999-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201914/http://www.businessweek.com/1999/02/b3611179.htm |archivedate=2008-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_44/b3806033.htm |title=The BusinessWeek Best Seller List |date=2002-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302204204/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_44/b3806033.htm |archivedate=2008-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on a number of occasions.

'''Captain Alexander '''"'''Sandy'''"''' Allan''' (26 February 1780 – 18 March 1854), was the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[sea captain]] and businessman who founded the [[Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers|Allan Shipping Line]] in 1819. Rising from [[shoemaker]] to [[shipping magnate]] in little more than thirty years, Allan retired in 1839 having made a fortune and created a [[wikt:transatlantic|transatlantic]] dynasty. He is recognised as one of the major contributors to [[Scotland]]'s commercial interests in the early 19th century, and to the establishment of the [[Firth of Clyde]] as an international centre of shipping. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] his [[brig]] ''Jean'' – so named for his wife – held the record for the fastest crossing between the [[Firth of Clyde]] and [[Quebec City]]. Under his five sons, the Allan Line became the world's largest privately owned shipping empire.

Sandy Allan was born at [[Fairlie, North Ayrshire]], the third son of James Allan – a cheerful and well-respected [[carpenter]] on the Fairlie House estate – and his wife Jean Brown (1750–1821), daughter of Gilbert Brown (1708–1774).&lt;ref&gt;Ravenscrag, by Thomas E. Appleton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The life and works of Robert Burns: Volume 1 (1896); Burns, Chambers &amp; Wallace&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was the younger sister of [[Agnes Broun|Agnes (Brown) Burns]], the mother of Sandy's famous first cousin, the Scottish bard, [[Robert Burns]], whose family also worked on the Fairlie estate.&lt;ref&gt;The Burns Encyclopedia (1980); Maurice Lindsay&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1786, Robert Burns stayed with the Allans at their cottage while avoiding a writ from James Armour in consequence of his relationship with [[Jean Armour]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Page 229&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandy Allan had expected to become a [[carpenter]], but after his father's death when he was twelve, he was apprenticed to a [[shoemaker]] in [[Kilmarnock]], working ten hours a day, except on Sundays. By 1800, when he was employed as a journeyman shoemaker near [[Galston, East Ayrshire|Galston]], Sandy quit and moved to [[Saltcoats]], intent on learning to be a ship's carpenter. He gave that idea up almost immediately for the chance to go to sea and was soon sailing as mate to Captain John Wilson of Saltcoats. Within a few years, Allan had served as Master and part-owner of several [[Lead ship|first-class ships]] trading out of Saltcoats. In 1806, at [[Saltcoats]], he married Jean Crawford (1782–1856), whose family lived in a small cottage in Castleweerock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~macfie/familyconnections.html Genealogical notes on the Allan family]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Peninsular War]], Captain Allan was master of the 175 [[ton]] [[brigantine]] ''Hero''. It was chartered by the [[British government]] to transport troops, cattle and goods to Spain to supply [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington's]] army. Vessels such as his were usually put under the protection of an armed [[convoy]] to ensure their safety, but Captain Allan grew impatient with the delay that these escorts added to his voyages. It was his practice to separate himself from the protecting [[warships]] and pursue his voyages unaccompanied, therefore making the journey in as short a time as possible. Those vessels which remained under convoy were always held up by the slowest in the group. His trips to Spain, although somewhat hazardous, were successful, and by 1814, Captain Allan had established a reputation for himself as both an excellent mariner and a shrewd businessman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.east-ayrshire.gov.uk/CommunityLifeAndLeisure/LocalHistoryAndHeritage/Famouspeople/AlexanderAllan.aspx |title=Alexander Allan – Famous People of East Ayrshire |access-date=23 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014130817/http://www.east-ayrshire.gov.uk/CommunityLifeAndLeisure/LocalHistoryAndHeritage/Famouspeople/AlexanderAllan.aspx |archive-date=14 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trading with Canada==

Since taking command of the ''Jean'', every spring and [[Fall (season)|fall]], Allan took his [[brig]] from [[Greenock]] to [[Montreal]] and back again. The produce that he exported belonged to dry goods merchants, many of whom had houses on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. It was Allan's responsibility as captain of the ship to both navigate across the ocean and sell the cargo on arrival, before purchasing Canadian supplies to be sold back to dry goods merchants in [[Scotland]]. On the outward journey his ship was filled with coal, iron, [[herring]]s, sugar and [[West Indian]] spices. On the return journey he took back wheat, [[peas]], flour, [[potash|pot ashes]] and most importantly, timber.

Captain Allan soon gained a reputation as an adept trader, and he was frequently known to have sold his entire cargo within a few hours of his arrival in [[Greenock]] from [[Montreal]]. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the ''Jean'' also held the record for the fastest crossing between the [[Firth of Clyde]] and [[Quebec City]]. During this period trade with Canada was still in its infancy, but the route which Allan pioneered between [[Greenock]] and [[Montreal]] would soon become synonymous with the [[Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers|Allan Line]], only on a far greater scale. By 1819, Allan had bought out his co-owners and the Allan Line, which then consisted of himself and the ''Jean'', was born.

Although [[Glasgow]] furnished most of Allan's outward cargoes, the goods were transferred from there to [[Greenock]], which was the port of loading and discharge for Canadian traders. So as to be better able to conduct his shipping business, Captain Allan moved his family from [[Saltcoats]] to [[Greenock]] in 1824.

==Expansion of the Allan Line==

In the winter of 1824, Captain Allan had the [[brig]] ''Favorite'' built in [[Montreal]], though the materials used to construct it had been sent out from [[Scotland]]. The ship turned out to be appropriately named as it was much in demand as a safe and speedy conveyance, both of goods and passengers. It was in the ''Favourite'' that Captain Allan's first and third sons (James and Bryce) received their [[nautical]] training.

In 1830, the 329 [[ton]] ship ''Canada'' was built for Captain Allan by Robert Steel &amp; Co., of [[Greenock]]. The launch of this 'monster vessel', as she was then regarded, was one of the notable events of the time. Crowds turned out to see her, and her arrival in [[Montreal]] produced quite a sensation there. Captain Allan himself commanded the ''Canada'' while his son James succeeded him in the command of the ''Favorite''.

The superiority of the British-built ship over that of the colonial led Captain Allan to contract with Robert Steel &amp; Co. for another ship, the [[barque]] ''Arabian''. This vessel was built in 1837, and Captain Allan's eldest son, James, was promoted to her command. The ownership of these latter vessels was almost exclusively confined to the Allan family as their need for investors became less necessary. The first voyage of the ''Arabian'' was made from [[Greenock]] to Canada in June 1837, and on her return to the [[Firth of Clyde]] she proceeded to [[Glasgow]], which was now possible as a result of the recently undertaken [[dredging]] operations. The ''Canada'', which was a deeper drafted vessel than the ''Arabian'', was not permitted to ascend the river until the following year, 1838. From this period onwards the terminal port of the inward Clyde-bound ships with general cargo and their outward loading port was Glasgow, and as such Captain Allan and his family made their new home there.

==Captain Allan's Sons==
[[File:The grave of Alexander Allan, shipbuilder, Glasgow Necropolis.jpg|thumb|300px|The grave of Alexander and Hugh Allan, shipbuilders, Glasgow Necropolis]]
Vessel after vessel was added to the Allan fleet, and soon Captain Allan's eldest son, '''James (1808–1880)''', retired from the sea to conduct the business of their now extensive shipping line, at [[Glasgow]]. The youngest of Captain Allan's five sons, '''Alexander (1825–1892)''', though still at a young age, joined James in the management of the Glasgow business.

The second son, '''[[Hugh Allan|Hugh (1810–1882)]]''', had at an early age been settled by his father in [[Montreal]] at the office of their shipping agents, where the fourth son, '''[[Andrew Allan (shipowner)|Andrew (1822–1901)]]''', would later follow him. Hugh possessed in a high degree the energy of his father, and in Montreal he speedily came to the front, becoming, while yet still young, a partner, and ultimately the head of the firm.

The increase of their fleets enabled the Allans to establish a branch of their service at [[Liverpool]] and a continued presence in the agency was needed there. The third son, '''Bryce (1814–1874)''', who had been in command of one of the ships, withdrew from the sea and took charge of the Liverpool branch.

==Legacy==

With his five sons settled at the terminal ports of their vessels, Captain Sandy Allan retired from active duty in 1839, but still took an active interest in the company. The principal direction of the affairs of the Allan Line now rested with the eldest son, James, later to be overtaken by [[Hugh Allan|Hugh]].

Captain Allan died 18 March 1854, aged 74. In his progress from [[shoemaker]] to [[seaman]], ship's mate to [[shipping magnate]], he had made his fortune and established a dynasty. At the same time, he had done a great deal for Scotland's commercial interests and for the [[Firth of Clyde|Clyde]] as a shipping centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.east-ayrshire.gov.uk/CommunityLifeAndLeisure/LocalHistoryAndHeritage/Famouspeople/AlexanderAllan.aspx |title=Alexander Allan – Famous People of East Ayrshire |access-date=23 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014130817/http://www.east-ayrshire.gov.uk/CommunityLifeAndLeisure/LocalHistoryAndHeritage/Famouspeople/AlexanderAllan.aspx |archive-date=14 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did live to see the initial step which ended in the substitution of [[steamships]] for [[sailing ship]]s in the Allan's Canadian trade, but it needed the courage and skill of the second generation to effect the change. When the proposition was first made, the old captain gravely shook his head and warned his sons to take care.

In 1854, the first Allan [[steamship]], the ''Canadian'' was launched at [[Dumbarton]]. This was speedily followed by three others, also constructed by Dennys of Dumbarton – the ''Indian'', ''Anglo-Saxon'' and ''North American''. The two first-named steamers were profitably employed by the [[British government]] during the [[Crimean War]]. In peace, they settled down to the trade for which they were built, the Canadian mail service, the first of the [[Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers]]. The service, subsidised by the [[Government of Canada]], was at first fortnightly in summer and monthly in winter before becoming weekly all the year round five years later.

==History==
The association was founded in 1916 as the American Association of Small Loan Brokers. The group formed to promote state laws that would make small loans more readily available to average Americans, who had few options at the time to receive small personal loans. The association changed names several times throughout the years before its merger in 1971 with the American Industrial Bankers Association, an organization of industrial banks, thrift and loan companies and sales finance companies. By 1983, the association’s members included diversified financial services firms and consumer credit subsidiaries of retailing firms, prompting another name change to the American Financial Services Association, which it is still known as today. &lt;ref&gt;“AFSA: Seventy-Five Years of Serving the Credit Community” published by The American Financial Services Association, 1991: 2, 9-10, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anna Ruby Gaye''' (née '''Gordy'''; January 28, 1922 – January 31, 2014) was an American businesswoman, [[music composer|composer]] and [[songwriter]]. An elder sister of [[Motown Records|Motown]] founder [[Berry Gordy]], she became a record executive in the mid-to-late 1950s distributing records released on [[Checker Records|Checker]] and [[Gone Records]] before forming the [[Anna Records|Anna]] label with [[Billy Davis (songwriter)|Billy Davis]] and sister [[Gwen Gordy Fuqua|Gwen]]. Gordy later became known as a songwriter for several hits including [[The Originals (band)|the Originals]]' "[[Baby, I'm for Real]]", and at least two songs on [[Marvin Gaye]]'s ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'' album. The first wife of Gaye, their turbulent marriage later served as inspiration for Gaye's album, ''[[Here, My Dear]]''.&lt;ref name="Ritz2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritz|first=David|title=Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jgYOT-LxgxQC&amp;pg=PR10|accessdate=6 July 2010|date=7 May 2003|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-306-81191-3|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2014}}

===Life and career===
Born Anna Ruby Gordy on January 28, 1922&lt;ref name="eurweb"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eurweb.com/2014/01/berry-gordys-statement-on-the-passing-of-his-sister-anna-gordy-gaye/ |title=Berry Gordy's Statement on the Passing of His Sister Anna Gordy Gaye |work=Eurweb.com |accessdate=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Oconee, Georgia]], she was the third eldest of [[Gordy family|Berry Gordy Sr.]] (Berry Gordy II) and Bertha Ida ([[married and maiden names|née]] Fuller) Gordy's eight children. Into her first year, Gordy's family relocated to Detroit. Following graduation from high school in 1940, Gordy relocated to California, which is where Gordy's younger brother Berry moved to after he dropped out of high school to form a boxing career. Returning to Detroit in the mid-1950s, she and younger sister Gwen became operators of the photo concession at Detroit's Flame Show Bar.

By the late 1950s, members of the Gordy clan were getting involved with the music business. In 1956, Anna began her career distributing records for [[Checker Records]]. In about 1957, she distributed a few recordings for [[Gone Records]]. In 1958, Anna and Gordy's younger sister Gwen founded the label [[Anna Records]] with musician [[Billy Davis (songwriter)|Billy Davis]], a year before Berry launched Tamla Records. Anna distributed Tamla's first national hit, [[Barrett Strong]]'s "[[Money (That's What I Want)]]". Artists such as [[David Ruffin]] and [[Joe Tex]] also recorded for the label, and [[Marvin Gaye]] became a session musician with the company. After the label was absorbed as a subsidiary of Motown in 1961, Gordy joined Motown as a songwriter. Some of her early compositions were recorded by Gaye and [[Mary Wells]]. In 1965, Gordy co-wrote [[Stevie Wonder]]'s "What Christmas Means to Me".

Gordy later co-composed the Originals' hits "[[Baby, I'm for Real]]" and "[[The Bells (The Originals song)|The Bells]]" with Marvin Gaye. Gordy's name was included as a co-songwriter on two songs on Gaye's 1971 album, ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'', including "[[Flyin' High (In the Friendly Sky)]]" and "[[God Is Love (song)|God Is Love]]". In 1973, Gordy's name was included in the credits to the song "[[Just to Keep You Satisfied]]", which was originally recorded in 1969 by [[The Monitors (American band)|the Monitors]], and recorded by the Originals two years later. Gaye's version was overdubbed from the Originals recording and reversed the song's romantic lyrics for a more solemn view of the end of a marriage. Gordy left Motown at the end of the 1970s and retired from the music industry.

===Personal life===
Gordy met Marvin Gaye in 1959 when he was 20 years old and singing with [[Harvey Fuqua|Harvey and the New Moonglows]]. Gaye soon began working at Anna Records and soon developed an attraction to Ms. Gordy. They eventually began dating in 1960. After a three-year courtship, they married in June 1963.

Inspired by their romance, Marvin penned hit singles about Anna including "[[Stubborn Kind of Fellow]]", "[[Pride and Joy (Marvin Gaye song)|Pride &amp; Joy]]" and "[[You're a Wonderful One]]". Of "Pride and Joy", Gaye said, "When I composed 'Pride and Joy', I was head over heels in love with Anna. I just wrote what I felt about her, and what she did for me. She was my pride and joy."{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=82}}

The marriage between Marvin and Anna was reportedly turbulent, including two public spats. In order to bring some stability to their home life, Anna and Marvin adopted a boy born on November 17, 1966, who was named after his adopted father (Marvin Pentz Gaye III). The boy was said to have been naturally conceived by Anna and Marvin in Motown's [[public relations]] stories of the couple, but Marvin confirmed his adoption in [[David Ritz]]'s biography, ''[[Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye]]''.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|pp=100–101}} In later years, the identity of the mother was revealed to be [[Denise Gordy]], Anna's niece.

In 1971, the couple moved to [[Hollywood Hills, California|Hollywood]]. Two years later, they filed for [[legal separation]]. Gaye settled in with a young woman named Janis Hunter, with whom he had two children. In November 1975, Gordy filed for divorce. After nearly two years, the case was settled in Gordy's favor after Gaye agreed to remit a portion of his royalties from his next album to her.&lt;ref name=snopes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/music/hidden/heredear.asp|title=snopes.com: Marvin Gaye Here, My Dear|accessdate=September 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting album, ''[[Here, My Dear]]'', gave audiences a view of the marriage from Marvin's point of view. After its release in December 1978, Gordy threatened to sue Marvin for $5 million for invasion of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20073368,00.html|title=In L.A.'s Other Marvin Case, It's Gaye Vs. Anna Gordy, With Brother Berry in the Middle|date=April 9, 1979|work=People.com|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing came of her threat.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt;

In the 1980s, Marvin and Anna reconciled as friends, and Anna accompanied Marvin to industry events following the release of his comeback album ''[[Midnight Love]]'', in 1982. Anna attended the [[25th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Awards in 1983]], at which Marvin was awarded two trophies. Marvin's [[Death of Marvin Gaye|death]] in 1984 devastated Anna; later she and Marvin's three children scattered most of his ashes near the [[Pacific Ocean]], while she kept a portion. When Marvin was honored with induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], Anna and Marvin Gaye III accepted on his behalf. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Gordy never remarried. Her last public appearance was in June 2008. She attended a [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] Heart Foundation event at which her brother Berry was honored. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Death===
Gordy died on January 31, 2014, three days after her 92nd birthday.&lt;ref name="TMZ"&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=TMZ|url=http://www.tmz.com/2014/01/31/marvin-gaye-ex-wife-anna-gordy-gaye-dies-dead-motown-songwriter|title=Marvin Gaye's Ex-Wife Anna Gordy Gaye Dead at 92|date=January 31, 2014|accessdate=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park&amp;nbsp;– Hollywood Hills]], Courts of Remembrance, Sanctuary of Enduring Protection, Private Family Room 70 ({{Coord|34.1496|-118.3202|region:US-CA_type:landmark|display=inline}}).&lt;ref name="FG"/&gt;

Founded in 2011, Arch Grants launched its international Business Plan Competition as a strategy to build the next generation of successful businesses within the St. Louis region. Five years ago, Missouri was ranked as the next-to-worst state in terms of its entrepreneurial activity &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fairlie|first1=Robert|title=Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity|url=http://www.kauffman.org/~/media/kauffman_org/research%20reports%20and%20covers/kiea/kiea_042709.pdf|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as large corporations left St. Louis or merged with companies headquartered elsewhere in the wake of the recession, Arch Grants was founded to attract and retain high-growth companies to drive economic development efforts throughout the St. Louis region.

As of July 2014, Arch Grants has funded 55 companies that have generated $6.5 million in revenue, attracted $17.7 million in additional capital, and created 192 net new jobs for St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karaoglu|first1=Kristin|title=City &amp; state accelerators boost their local economies |url=http://vator.tv/news/2014-06-24-city-state-accelerators-boost-their-local-economies|agency=Vator News|date=June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 98% of the companies in business are still headquartered in St. Louis.

'''''Balfour v Balfour''''' [1919] 2 KB 571 is a leading [[English contract law]] case. It held that there is a [[rebuttable presumption]] against an intention to create a legally enforceable agreement when the agreement is domestic in nature.

==Facts==
Mr Balfour was a civil engineer, and worked for the Government as the Director of [[Irrigation]] in [[Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]). Mrs Balfour was living with him. In 1915, they both came back to England during Mr Balfour's leave. But Mrs Balfour had developed [[Rheumatism|rheumatic]] [[arthritis]]. Her doctor advised her to stay in England, because the Ceylon climate would be detrimental to her health. Mr Balfour's boat was about to set sail, and he orally promised her £30 a month until she came back to Ceylon. They drifted apart, and Mr Balfour wrote saying it was better that they remain apart. In March 1918, Mrs Balfour sued him to keep up with the monthly £30 payments. In July she got a [[decree nisi]] and in December she obtained an order for [[alimony]].

At first instance, [[Charles Sargant|Sargant J]] held that Mr Balfour was under an obligation to support his wife.

==Judgment==
The Court of Appeal unanimously held that there was no enforceable agreement, although the depth of their reasoning differed. [[Warrington LJ]] delivered his opinion first, the core part being this passage.&lt;ref&gt;[1919] 2 KB 571,574-575&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The matter really reduces itself to an absurdity when one considers it, because if we were to hold that there was a contract in this case we should have to hold that with regard to all the more or less trivial concerns of life where a wife, at the request of her husband, makes a promise to him, that is a promise which can be enforced in law. All I can say is that there is no such contract here. These two people never intended to make a bargain which could be enforced in law. The husband expressed his intention to make this payment, and he promised to make it, and was bound in honour to continue it so long as he was in a position to do so. The wife on the other hand, so far as I can see, made no bargain at all. That is in my opinion sufficient to dispose of the case.}}

Then [[Duke LJ]] gave his. He placed weight on the fact that the parties had not yet been divorced, and that the promise had been made still whilst as husband and wife.

{{cquote|[[Image:1stLordMerrivale.jpg|thumb|right|[[Duke LJ]], previously a Conservative party politician, became the president of the divorce division from 1919 to 1933.]]
In the Court below the plaintiff conceded that down to the time of her suing in the Divorce Division there was no separation, and that the period of absence was a period of absence as between husband and wife living in amity. An agreement for separation when it is established does involve mutual considerations.

That was why in ''[[Eastland v Burchell]]'' 3 QBD 432, the agreement for separation was found by the learned judge to have been of decisive consequence. But in this case there was no separation agreement at all. The parties were husband and wife, and subject to all the conditions, in point of law, involved in that relationship. It is impossible to say that where the relationship of husband and wife exists, and promises are exchanged, they must be deemed to be promises of a contractual nature. In order to establish a contract there ought to be something more than mere mutual promises having regard to the domestic relations of the parties. It is required that the obligations arising out of that relationship shall be displaced before either of the parties can found a contract upon such promises. The formula which was stated in this case to support the claim of the lady was this: In consideration that you will agree to give me 30l. a month I will agree to forego my right to pledge your credit. In the judgment of the majority of the Court of Common Pleas in ''[[Jolly v Rees]]'' (1864) 15 C. B. (N. S.) 628, which was affirmed in the decision of ''[[Debenham v Mellon]]'' (1880) 6 App. Cas. 24 Erle C.J. states this proposition 5 : “But taking the law to be, that the power of the wife to charge her husband is in the capacity of his agent, it is a solecism in reasoning to say that she derives her authority from his will, and at the same time to say that the relation of wife creates the authority against his will, by a presumptio juris et de jure from marriage.” What is said on the part of the wife in this case is that her arrangement with her husband that she should assent to that which was in his discretion to do or not to do was the consideration moving from her to her husband. The giving up of that which was not a right was not a consideration. The proposition that the mutual promises made in the ordinary domestic relationship of husband and wife of necessity give cause for action on a contract seems to me to go to the very root of the relationship, and to be a possible fruitful source of dissension and quarrelling. I cannot see that any benefit would result from it to either of the parties, but on the other hand it would lead to unlimited litigation in a relationship which should be obviously as far as possible protected from possibilities of that kind. I think, therefore, that in point of principle there is no foundation for the claim which is made here, and I am satisfied that there was no consideration *578 moving from the wife to the husband or promise by the husband to the wife which was sufficient to sustain this action founded on contract. I think, therefore, that the appeal must be allowed.}}

[[Lord Justice Atkin]]&lt;ref&gt;[1919] 2 KB 571, 579-580&lt;/ref&gt; took a different approach, emphasising that there was no "intention to effect legal relations". That was so because it was a domestic agreement between husband and wife, and it meant the onus of proof was on the plaintiff, Mrs Balfour. She did not rebut the presumption.

{{cquote|&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:Lord Atkin of Aberdovey.jpg|right|thumb|[[James Atkin, Baron Atkin]] became well known for his original judgments, including ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' and ''[[Liversidge v Anderson]]'']] --&gt;
The defence to this action on the alleged contract is that the defendant, the husband, entered into no contract with his wife, and for the determination of that it is necessary to remember that there are agreements between parties which do not result in contracts within the meaning of that term in our law. The ordinary example is where two parties agree to take a [[walk]] together, or where there is an offer and an acceptance of [[hospitality]]. Nobody would suggest in ordinary circumstances that those agreements result in what we know as a contract, and one of the most usual forms of agreement which does not constitute a contract appears to me to be the arrangements which are made between husband and wife. It is quite common, and it is the natural and inevitable result of the relationship of husband and wife, that the two spouses should make arrangements between themselves - agreements such as are in dispute in this action - agreements for allowances, by which the husband agrees that he will pay to his wife a certain sum of money, per week, or per month, or per year, to cover either her own expenses or the necessary expenses of the household and of the [[children]] of the marriage, and in which the wife promises either expressly or impliedly to apply the allowance for the purpose for which it is given. To my mind those agreements, or many of them, do not result in contracts at all, and they do not result in contracts even though there may be what as between other parties would constitute consideration for the agreement. The [[Consideration in English law|consideration]], as we know, may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other. That is a well-known definition, and it constantly happens, I think, that such arrangements made between husband and wife are arrangements in which there are mutual promises, or in which there is consideration in form within the definition that I have mentioned. Nevertheless they are not contracts, and they are not contracts because the parties did not intend that they should be attended by legal consequences. To my mind it would be of the worst possible example to hold that agreements such as this resulted in legal obligations which could be enforced in the Courts. It would mean this, that when the husband makes his wife a promise to give her an allowance of 30s. or 2l. a week, whatever he can afford to give her, for the maintenance of the household and children, and she promises so to apply it, not only could she sue him for his failure in any week to supply the allowance, but he could sue her for non-performance of the obligation, express or implied, which she had undertaken upon her part. All I can say is that the small Courts of this country would have to be multiplied one hundredfold if these arrangements were held to result in legal obligations. They are not sued upon, not because the parties are reluctant to enforce their legal rights when the agreement is broken, but because the parties, in the inception of the arrangement, never intended that they should be sued upon. Agreements such as these are outside the realm of contracts altogether. The common law does not regulate the form of agreements between spouses. Their promises are not sealed with seals and sealing [[wax]]. The consideration that really obtains for them is that natural love and affection which counts for so little in these cold Courts. The terms may be repudiated, varied or renewed as performance proceeds or as disagreements develop, and the principles of the common law as to exoneration and discharge and accord and satisfaction are such as find no place in the [[Home|domestic]] code. The parties themselves are advocates, judges, Courts, sheriff's officer and reporter. In respect of these promises each house is a domain into which the King's writ does not seek to run, and to which his officers do not seek to be admitted. The only question in this case is whether or not this promise was of such a class or not. For the reasons given by my brethren it appears to me to be plainly established that the promise here was not intended by either party to be attended by legal consequences. I think the [[Legal burden of proof|onus]] was upon the plaintiff, and the plaintiff has not established any contract. The parties were living together, the wife intending to return. The suggestion is that the husband bound himself to pay 30l. a month under all circumstances, and she bound herself to be satisfied with that sum under all circumstances, and, although she was in ill-health and alone in this country, that out of that sum she undertook to defray the whole of the medical expenses that might fall upon her, whatever might be the development of her illness, and in whatever expenses it might involve her. To my mind neither party contemplated such a result. I think that the [[parol evidence]] upon which the case turns does not establish a contract. I think that the letters do not evidence such a contract, or amplify the oral evidence which was given by the wife, which is not in dispute. For these reasons I think the judgment of the Court below was wrong and that this appeal should be allowed.}}

==Significance==
The case is often cited in conjunction with ''[[Merritt v Merritt]]'' [1970] 2 All ER 760; [1970] 1 WLR 1211.  Here the court [[distinguish]]ed the case from ''Balfour v Balfour'' on the fact that Mr and Mrs Merritt, although still married, were estranged at the time the agreement was made and therefore any agreement between them was made with the intention to create legal relations.  Both cases are often quoted examples of the principle of [[precedent]].

'''Beta Alpha Psi''' ('''ΒΑΨ''') is an international [[honor society]] for [[accounting]], [[finance]] and [[information systems]] students&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bap.org/about About Beta Alpha Psi]&lt;/ref&gt; attending universities accredited by the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] (AACSB) or the [[European Quality Improvement System]] (EQUIS).

It was founded on February 12, 1919, at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] and is currently headquartered in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], [[North Carolina]], in the United States. The organization has over 300 chapters on college and university campuses with over 300,000 members worldwide.&lt;ref name="ΒΑΨ About page"&gt;{{cite web | title=ΒΑΨ About page | url= https://www.bap.org/about}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
Beta Alpha Psi encourages and recognizes scholastic and professional excellence in the business information field, promotes the study and practice of [[accounting]], [[finance]] and [[information systems]], and provides opportunities for self-development, service and association among members and practicing professionals. It "strives to encourage a sense of ethical, social, and public responsibility".&lt;ref name="ΒΑΨ About page"/&gt; The organization also promotes the development of technical and professional skills that are used to complement the university education, philanthropic activities, and interaction between students, faculty and professionals. Beta Alpha Psi's objectives are accomplished through the activities of each chapter respectively. Each chapter receives financial funding for these activities through sponsorship of various public and private firms.

==History==
On April 17, 1896, the [[New York legislature]] established the [[Certified Public Accountant]] (CPA) designation. This designation in business encouraged a greater focus on [[accounting]] and [[commerce]] knowledge, and Beta Alpha Psi was formed in 1919 to promote the CPA rank on college campuses. Two years after its founding, all of the existing U.S. states had adopted CPA regulations.

Beta Alpha Psi's beginnings relate to Hiram Scovill, class of 1908, an accounting professor, during his return to the University of Illinois in 1908. Several new honor societies and [[Professional fraternities and sororities|professional fraternities]] that had formed a few years before Scovill's return introduced students to the benefits of professional organizations.

Scovill and his junior colleague [[A. C. Littleton]] formed an accounting club on campus in 1917. Beta Alpha Psi emerged two years later. The first members were six students from Professor Scovill's CPA course. The organization was founded on the three basic principles of scholarship, practicality, and sociability, and its initial objective was to stimulate cooperation and interest in accounting.One of its main purposes was to encourage and foster service as the basis of the accounting profession and to secure the highest ethical ideals in the practice of accountancy. On this multifaceted base, eleven students were initiated as active members of the organization on February 12, 1919. Professor Scovill was initiated as an honorary member.

In the original constitution for the University of Illinois chapter, the initiation fee was $10 and dues were an additional $2 per semester. Any member who was absent from a function without first being excused was charged 25 cents. Section I, Article IV, of the original constitution stated that any male person who was registered in third-year accounting, who contemplated a continuance in accounting work, and who had a [[Junior (education)|junior]] class standing as shown by his college records was eligible for membership in the organization.

Nine of the eleven members became CPAs. By 1939, only one of the original eleven members, the first president Russell Morrison, was a practicing CPA. Morrison was actively involved in the [[American Accounting Association]]. In 1964, he, along with eight other leading accounting professors, was selected to serve on the "Committee to Prepare a Statement of Basic Accounting Theory", which provided major contributions to American accounting thought. In February 1921, Beta Alpha Psi officially became a national organization after it adopted a national constitution. Less than nine years later, the organization boasted 900 members, and on November 8, 1950, Jeannie Skelton, the first female member of Beta Alpha Psi, was inducted into the Miami University (Ohio) chapter.&lt;ref name="New Accountant USA"&gt;{{cite web | title=New Accountant USA | url= http://www.newaccountantusa.com/newsFeat/LS/LS_beta.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beta Alpha Psi's logo consists of three different aspects: the emblem, the rising sun, and the crossed keys. The emblem is used to promote the promise of careers for financial information professionals. The rising sun represents the professionals who continuously rise higher. The crossed keys symbolize the knowledge Beta Alpha Psi provides that will unlock the doors for the financial world. Together these three aspects represent what Beta Alpha Psi is about. The Greek letters Beta Alpha Psi represent scholarship, social responsibility, and practicality respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bap.org/about|title = About Beta Alpha Psi|date = |accessdate = December 2, 2015|website = Beta Alpha Psi|publisher = Beta Alpha Psi|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International presence===
Beta Alpha Psi continues to grow as new chapters are installed internationally. Outside the United States, local chapters operate at the [[University of Sydney]] and [[University of Technology Sydney]] in [[Australia]]; and at [[Massey University]], the [[University of Auckland]], the [[University of Waikato]], and at [[Victoria University of Wellington]] in [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ΒΑΨ Chapters page | url= https://www.bap.org/active-chapters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational structure==
Beta Alpha Psi is governed by a constitution and by laws. It is managed by the Board of Directors, which consists of thirteen financial information professionals or professors of accounting, finance or information systems, the Professional Partners chair, and two alumni representatives. The alumni representatives are recent graduates who were active in their Beta Alpha Psi chapters.

The organization relies on funding to support its activities. Beta Alpha Psi receives a portion of its funding from charter maintenance fees and an initiation fee. The initiation fee is a one-time fee and is paid upon acceptance into the organization. A majority of the organization's funding comes from contributions from industry, consulting, and professional service firms. They include but are not limited to donations from alumni of the organization.

Beta Alpha Psi's Professional Partners consists of prominent professional accountants who are active in public accounting, industry, and government. Members serve three-year terms. The Partners provides the Board of Directors independent, external advice on and assistance in both the routine operations and the special projects of the organization.

The International Chapter is composed of all faculty advisors, student presidents, and past and present members of Beta Alpha Psi. This body holds a meeting every year and provides advice and assistance to the Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="ΒΑΨ About page"/&gt; Local chapters are composed of the students and the faculty members at each university. Students guide each chapter's activities while faculty advisors mentor the chapters and provide a liaison between the members and other faculty.&lt;ref name="ΒΑΨ About page"/&gt; But different local chapters operate in diverse ways. While some chapters are organized as accounting honor societies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=USI ΒΑΨ Information page | url=http://business.usi.edu/hs_bap.asp | access-date=2009-06-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627033702/http://business.usi.edu/hs_bap.asp | archive-date=2009-06-27 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or others operate as financial information fraternities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Iota Chapter Homepage | url=http://www.uscbay.org/ | access-date=2009-06-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506092512/http://www.uscbay.org/ | archive-date=2009-05-06 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Blanche Butler Ames.jpg|thumb|right|Blanche Butler Ames]]
'''Blanche Butler Ames''' (March 2, 1847 – December 26, 1939) was the wife of [[Adelbert Ames]], a decorated general of the [[American Civil War]] and [[United States Senate|Senator]] and [[List of Governors of Mississippi|Governor]] of [[Mississippi]] during Reconstruction.

Blanche Butler was born in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], the second child and only daughter of [[Sarah Hildreth Butler|Sarah Jones]] (née Hildreth) and [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Franklin Butler]], who would also serve as a general in the Civil War. She attended school in Lowell until she was sent to the Academy of the Visitation in [[Washington, D.C.]] at age 13, where she described the sectional tension between northern and southern students on the eve of the Civil War.

Blanche met Adelbert Ames, who had served under her father in the [[Army of the James]], while he was serving as Senator from Mississippi during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. They married at Saint Anne's Episcopal Church in Lowell, the same church where her parents were wed, on July 21, 1870, and had six children: [[Butler Ames|Butler]], Edith, Sarah, [[Blanche Ames Ames|Blanche]], [[Adelbert Ames, Jr.|Adelbert, Jr.]], and Jessie. When her husband was elected Governor of Mississippi in 1873, Blanche accompanied him, and wrote a series of letters detailing her experiences as a Northern woman living in the South during Reconstruction. After Adelbert resigned under pressure in 1876, the Ames family returned to Lowell to pursue business interests, where they remained for much the rest of their lives.

After her husband's death in 1933, Mrs. Ames compiled a collection of their letters, released by the family as ''Chronicles from the Nineteenth Century: Family Letters of Blanche Butler and Adelbert Ames'' in 1957. She also compiled a detailed account of the Butler Ancestry in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/details/butlerancestryof00ames The Butler ancestry of Gen. Benjamin Franklin Butler in America]''&lt;/ref&gt;  She died at the Ames winter home in [[Ormond Beach, Florida]], on December 26, 1939, at the age of 92, and is buried beside her husband and their children at the [[Hildreth Cemetery|Hildreth family cemetery]] in Lowell, across from her parents and siblings.

&lt;!--[[Image:ACCA.gif|right|float]] comment out pic, please add fair use rationale if you want to use the pic --&gt;

The '''Certified Accounting Technician''' ('''CAT''') [[United Kingdom|UK]] qualification is offered by  the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA).  Upon completion of the exams and required practical work experience the CAT graduate will be able to apply to use the letters CAT after his or her name. In addition, they will have the opportunity to join the CAT alumni.

Although CAT can be obtained as a stand-alone qualification, it is often the case that individuals study for CAT as an introductionary qualification in accountancy prior to training to become a [[Chartered Certified Accountant]] through the ACCA Professional Scheme. It usually takes one and a half years to complete the nine CAT exams. However, there is no restriction on the number of papers that can be attempted in each sitting.

CAT's rival is the [[Association of Accounting Technicians]]  (AAT) qualification.   ACCA was a sponsor of the AAT before breaking its links in the mid 1990s in order to form the CAT qualification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/6855978/acca-withdraws-aat-sponsorship EBSCO Host Connection ACCA Withdraws AAT Sponsorship]&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale behind this move was that it wanted a technician level qualification which followed the same strategic direction of the ACCA qualification, i.e. one with an international profile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/7092503/aat-acca-fall-out EBSCO Host Connection AAT and ACCA Fallout]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Certified Accounting Technician qualification (CAT) has now been placed on the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) National Qualifications Framework, which means that publicly funded educational institutions are now eligible for grants to help them train individuals towards this qualification in the [[United Kingdom]].

Under a recent re-structure of its courses, the ACCA has placed the CAT as part of the Foundations in Accountancy suite of qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accaglobal.com/en/qualifications/glance/fia.html Introductory Qualifications in Accountancy]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Society of Management Accountants of Canada''' ({{lang-fr|La Société des comptables en management du Canada}}), also known as '''Certified Management Accountants of Canada''' ({{lang-fr|Comptables en management accrédités du Canada}}) and '''CMA Canada''', awards the [[Certified Management Accountant]] designation in [[Canada]].

==Competencies, accreditation process and post-qualification development==

CMAs are expected to undergo specific training and practical experience to achieve specified competencies in the area of strategic management accounting, which are intended to prepare them for senior leadership roles in their organizations.&lt;ref name="CompMap"&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''The CMA Competency Map'' |url = http://www.cma-canada.org/index.cfm/ci_id/19412/la_id/1/document/1/re_id/0 |accessdate = 2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are six functional competencies and four enabling competencies in that regard:

'''Functional competencies'''

* [[Strategic management]]
* [[Risk management]] and [[corporate governance|governance]]
* [[Performance management]]
* [[Performance measurement]]
* [[Finance|Financial management]]
* [[Financial reporting]]

'''Enabling competencies'''

* [[Problem solving]] and [[decision making]]
* [[Leadership]] and [[group dynamics]]
* [[Professionalism]] and [[ethics|ethical behaviour]]
* [[Communication]]

While candidates may come from a variety of backgrounds, the CMA career path is expected to progress in the following manner:&lt;ref name="CompMap"/&gt;

{| border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"
|- 
| '''Stage''' || '''Phase''' || '''Nature'''
|-
| '''Acquisition'''
| Prior to passage of CMA Entrance Examination
| In process of completing undergraduate studies, or 5–7 years thereafter. Already in junior to [[middle management]] level in their organization.
|-
| '''Basic Proficiency'''
| Acquisition of the CMA designation and the following five years thereafter
| Already in [[middle management]] level, and progressively gaining more practical experience and responsibility.
|-
| '''Advanced Proficiency'''
| 5–10 years post-qualification
| Early- to mid-career professionals, with most having achieved more senior positions within the [[middle management]] layer. A significant number hold introductory [[senior management]] positions in their area of specialization or in the organization as a whole.
|-
| '''Mastery'''
| 10–25 years post-qualification
| Late-career professionals, operating in [[senior management]] roles. Most are either the highest-ranking financial officers in their organization or financial professionals with specialized knowledge in particular functional areas. A significant proportion of individuals are operating in the desired "C" space - i.e., [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], [[Chief financial officer|CFO]], [[Chief risk officer|CRO]] or [[Chief information officer|CIO]] - and some of these are leaders of large enterprises or significant [[strategic business unit]]s.

CMA candidates (without advanced professional standing) must have obtained a university degree and have credits in a specified list of subjects, before they can write the CMA Entrance Examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''CMA Entrance Examination'' |url = http://www.cma-canada.org/index.cfm/ci_id/4122/la_id/1/document/1/re_id/0 |accessdate = 2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon passing this stage, they then enter the Strategic Leadership Programme ("SLP"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''CMA Canada Strategic Leadership Program'' |url = http://www.cma-canada.org/index.cfm/ci_id/4123/la_id/1/document/1/re_id/0 |accessdate = 2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has the following components:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''The CMA Canada Accreditation Process'' |url = http://www.cma-canada.org/index.cfm/ci_id/4121/la_id/1/document/1/re_id/0 |accessdate = 2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Development Phase''
** followed by the successful passing of the '''CMA Case Examination'''
* ''Application Phase''
** leading to the successful preparation and presentation of the '''Board Report''', containing detailed analysis and recommendations on a specified case study
* Completion of 24 months of '''relevant full-time progressive practical experience confirmed by the employer''' - of which at least 12 months must be concurrent with the SLP
** Candidates are expected to be '''expanding their on-the-job responsibilities while undertaking the SLP'''

Successful passage of the above will result in the granting of the CMA designation. After attaining the designation, there are specified requirements for continuous professional learning and development that must be undertaken to remain in good standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''The National Standard for Continuous Professional Learning and Development for certified Management Accountants'' |url = http://www.cma-canada.org/index.cfm/ci_id/5104/la_id/1/document/1/re_id/0 |accessdate = 2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2420">'''Constantin Belimace''' (July 1848&amp;ndash;1932) was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-born [[Romania]]n and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] poet.

He was born into an [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] family in [[Malovišta]], a village that formed part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Rumelia Eyalet]] and is now in the Republic of Macedonia. His father was Tașcu Belimace. He attended school in his native village and at a Serbian school in Belgrade. In 1873, he moved to [[Bucharest]], capital of the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]]. There, he opened a restaurant favored by students, particularly from south of the Danube, and by writers. In the enthusiastically patriotic atmosphere that followed the [[Romanian War of Independence]], Belimace began composing poems, thus becoming among the first writers in the [[Aromanian language]]: "Cucotul" ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]: "Cocoșul"; "The Rooster") and "Dimândarea părintească" ("Porunca părintească"; "The Parents' Command"). These appeared, respectively, in ''România'' and ''Voința națională''. Later, together with others, they were published in Andrei Bagav's 1887 ''Cartea de alegere'' (''Cartea de citire''; ''Reader'').&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;

Belimace helped found the Macedo-Romanian cultural society and Lumina association, and took part in editing periodicals such as ''Frațil’ea într’u dreptate'' and ''Macedonia''. His contributions appeared in ''Frațil’ea'', ''Grai bun'', ''Lumina'', ''Peninsula Balcanică'' and ''Românul de la Pind'', as well as in various calendars and almanacs. After returning to Macedonia, he worked as a supervisor at the Romanian boarding high school in [[Bitola]]. During World War I, he was held hostage in Bulgaria for two years. He died in Bitola in 1932, when the city was in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="sasu"&gt;Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române'', vol. I, p. 152.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8144">The '''Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act''' is a Canadian regulatory statute, which has seen many amendments since it was originally passed in 1970.&lt;ref name=cpla&gt;[http://www.laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38/FullText.html laws.justice.gc.ca: "Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-38)"]&lt;/ref&gt; It governs the packaging, labelling, sale, importation and advertising of prepackaged and certain other products.&lt;ref name=cpla/&gt;

It requires that prepackaged consumer products bear accurate and meaningful labelling information to help consumers make informed purchasing decisions.&lt;ref name=cb/&gt; The Act prohibits the making of false or misleading representations and sets out specifications for mandatory label information such as the product's name, net quantity and dealer identity.&lt;ref name=cb/&gt; It allows designated inspectors to: enter any place at any reasonable time; examine prepackaged products, open packages, examine and make copies of documents or papers; and seize products, labelling, packaging or advertising material which do not conform with the Act and Regulations. Conviction of an offense under the Act is rewarded with up to a year in prison and a $10,000 fine.&lt;ref name=cb&gt;[http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/02907.html competitionbureau.gc.ca: "Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act"], 2018-02-22&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration and enforcement of the Act and Regulations, as they relate to non‑food products, is the responsibility of the Competition Bureau, an agency of [[Industry Canada]].&lt;ref name=site/&gt; Administration and enforcement of the Act and Regulations, as it relates to food products, is the responsibility of the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] (CFIA).&lt;ref name=site/&gt; There are certain classes of items that are exempt from the CPLA, such as commercial, industrial, or institutional use only products or drugs or products for export only.&lt;ref name=site&gt;[http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/01248.html competitionbureau.gc.ca: "Guide to the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act and Regulations"], October 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations govern the consistency, completeness, and accuracy of the labelling and packaging of consumer goods.&lt;ref name=faq/&gt; These regulations create a uniform method for the labelling and packaging of consumer goods to assist consumers in making informed choices in the marketplace.&lt;ref name=faq&gt;[http://www.inspection.gc.ca/about-the-cfia/acts-and-regulations/faq-consumer-packaging-and-labelling-regulations/eng/1426692873531/1426692889910 "Frequently Asked Questions: Consumer Packaging and Labelling Regulations"], 2015-03-18&lt;/ref&gt; A helpful Guide is available from the Federal government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publications.gc.ca/site/eng/96421/publication.html publications.gc.ca: "Guide to the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act and regulations"] (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The CPLA broadly defines "product" to mean any article that is, or may be, the subject of trade or commerce, including both food and non-food items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doingbusinessincanada.com/legal-guide-0/federal-consumer-product--and-labelling-standards-1/consumer-packaging-and-labelling-act-217 "Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act"]&lt;/ref&gt; Textiles fall under the [[Textile Labelling Act]], while precious metals fall under the [[Precious Metals Marking Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.canada.ca/en/services/business/permits/federallyregulatedbusinessactivities/labellingrequirements.html canada.ca: "Labelling requirements"],
 2017-05-12&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Act has undergone several major revisions throughout its time: in 2002-12-31, in 2011-11-29, in 2015-02-26.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38/PITIndex.html laws.justice.gc.ca: "Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-38) - Full Documents available for previous versions"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Two executives of Mucci International Marketing Inc. and Mucci Pac Ltd. and their companies were levied fines by the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency|CFIA]] tribunal that totalled $1.5 million. Their offense was fraudulently to put "Product of Canada" labels on large quantities of peppers, [[tomatoes]] and [[cucumbers]] grown mainly in [[Mexico]]. The defendants supplied the mislabelled produce to [[Costco]], to [[Loblaws]] and to [[Sobeys]]. The fraud at the [[Ontario Food Terminal]] was discovered in 2012, and investigators later executed in 2013 and 2014 three [[search warrants]], which resulted in the seizure of more than 70 boxes of documents. A court in [[Windsor, Ontario]] heard the case. The agreed statement of facts quoted an email of a Mucci worker, that he was told "to make it Canada even though it is Mexico."&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/it-says-product-of-canada-but-is-it-the-growing-problem-of-ferreting-out-counterfeit-vegetables financialpost.com: ``It says 'Product of Canada' but is it? The growing problem of ferreting out counterfeit vegetables''], 29 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The company, which was at the time located in [[Kingsville, Ontario]], was also sentenced to [[probation]] for a three-year term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/kingsville-company-fined-1-5m-for-misrepresenting-products-country-of-origin-1.3621671 cbc.ca: "Kingsville company fined $1.5M for misrepresenting products' country of origin"], 8 Jun 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, a [[Maidstone, Ontario]] tomato processing company, that in addition had received a controversial $3-million provincial grant, was convicted of  fraudulently mislabelling products as [[Organic food|organic]] under the CAPA as well as other legislation. The owner and the company were also charged with falsifying the country of origin on their products between September 2013 and July 2015, passing off with labels that read "Product of Canada" produce that was American in origin. The owner was charged with lying to a federal food inspector on 8 January 2015. The case was heard in the [[Ontario Court of Justice]]. Separately, the company went bankrupt, owing more than a hundred creditors a total of over $25 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/thomas-canning-to-plead-guilty-to-mislabelling-products-as-organic windsorstar.ca: "Thomas Canning to plead guilty to mislabelling products as organic"], 12 Oct 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pcom&gt;[https://www.producer.com/2017/03/ont-company-faces-legal-action-on-several-fronts/ producer.com: "Ont. company faces legal action on several fronts"], 9 Mar 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 March 2018, a [[Leamington, Ontario]] greenhouse grower named AMCO Produce and its directors Fausto Amicone and Mark Wehby answered to charges brought by the CFIA for origin-of-vegetable fraud in a Windsor court. The corporation pleaded guilty to three charges under the [[Food and Drugs Act]], the CPLA and the [[Canada Agricultural Products Act]], and was fined $210,000.&lt;ref name=tpc21&gt;[https://www.thepacker.com/article/ontario-greenhouse-group-responds-amco-verdict thepacker.com: ``Ontario greenhouse group responds to Amco verdict''], 21 Mar 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The individuals were let off in exchange for the guilty plea.&lt;ref name=ws13/&gt; The sentence included "intrusive" probation for a period of time under which the CFIA gains "unfettered" access to company records.&lt;ref name=ws13/&gt; The case began when the CFIA did in February 2013 a random inspection at the Ontario Food Terminal. Greenhouse peppers had been fraudulently mislabelled as Ontario produce at a time of year that was too cold for greenhouses to operate. The case covered offenses that occurred over a two-year span of time.&lt;ref name=tpc20&gt;[https://www.thepacker.com/article/canadian-company-fined-mislabeling-mexican-produce thepacker.com: ``Canadian company fined for mislabeling Mexican produce''], 20 Mar 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ws13&gt;[http://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/amco-produce-fined-210k-for-passing-off-foreign-vegetables-as-canadian windsorstar.com: "AMCO Produce fined $210K for passing off foreign vegetables as Canadian"], 13 Mar 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

An active [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Kyle uncovered many instances of misappropriations in state and local governments during his fifteen years as auditor. He planned to run for [[governor of Louisiana|governor]] in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpb.org/programs/swi/swi2600.html|title=Interview with Dan Kyle, January 23, 2003|publisher=lpb.org|accessdate=November 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he switched to the insurance commissioner race, when another Republican candidate for that office, [[Tony Perkins (politician)|Tony Perkins]], a [[Louisiana State Legislature|state representative]] from [[East Baton Rouge Parish]], abandoned the campaign to become president of the [[Family Research Council]].

As legislative auditor, Kyle posted an office sign "In God We Trust, All Others We Audit." His work uncovered [[embezzlement|embezzlers]], [[cronyism]], and [[Political corruption#Kickbacks|political kickbacks]]. His office moved against the late Elections Commissioner [[Jerry Fowler|Jerry M. Fowler]], indicted and convicted of receiving kickbacks from voting-machine contractors. Kyle investigated several college presidents but stressed that he does not believe in dismissing academic heads solely because of problems with an audit, as such positions are multi-faceted in scope.&lt;ref name=diverse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diverseeducation.com/article/705/state-auditor-kyle-doesn-t-enjoy-playing-the-bad-guy.html|title=Scott Dyer, "State Auditor Kyle Doesn't Enjoy Playing the Bad Guy", July 6, 2000|publisher=diverseeducation.com|accessdate=November 23, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle's work led to the conviction of nearly 250 public officials and government employees for the misappropriation of state funds.&lt;ref name=campaigns&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=6420|title=Our Campaigns: Dan Kyle|publisher=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=November 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his auditor's position, Kyle, both a PhD and a [[Certified Public Accountant|C.P.A.]], taught governmental [[accounting]] and auditing from 1968-1989 at [[Louisiana State University]] in Baton Rouge.&lt;ref name=campaigns/&gt; In 2000, Kyle uncovered serious problems with an audit of [[historically black]] [[Grambling State University]] in [[Grambling, Louisiana|Grambling]] in [[Lincoln Parish, Louisiana|Lincoln Parish]]. A 1998 audit of the same institution uncovered no problems, but two years later, the auditor received inaccurate and incomplete information from the university administration. Grambling had four months of data missing, which rendered it impossible to conduct the required two-year audit.&lt;ref name=diverse/&gt;

In 1998, Kyle was invited by [[Leo Deslatte]], the new Republican mayor of [[Pineville, Louisiana|Pineville]] in [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides Parish]], to conduct an audit of the previous [[Fred Baden]] administration. While Kyle's report found [[malfeasance]] regarding Baden's management, [[state Attorney General]] [[Richard Ieyoub]] declared insufficient evidence of wrongdoing to bring about an indictment of the 28-year Democratic mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20091218/NEWS01/912180323/-1/NEWSFRONT2/7-term-Pineville-Mayor-Fred-Baden-remembered-for-big-heart|title=Bret H.

In the [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] held on October 4, 2003 for insurance commissioner, Kyle trailed the Democrat [[J. Robert Wooley]], 424,961 (33.7 percent) to 467,084 (37.1 percent). Four lesser-known candidates held the remaining but critical 30 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcms2&amp;rqsdta=100403|title=Louisiana election returns, October 4, 2003|publisher=sos.louisiana.gov|accessdate=November 23, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the general election, Wooley defeated Kyle, 773,578 (57.7 percent) to 567,034 (42.3 percent). Kyle won only a quartet of the more Republican parishes, [[Bossier Parish, Louisiana|Bossier]], [[Lafayette Parish, Louisiana|Lafayette]], [[Livingston Parish, Louisiana|Livingston]], and [[St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana|St. Tammany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcms2&amp;rqsdta=111503|title=Louisiana election returns, November 15, 2003|publisher=sos.louisiana.gov|accessdate=November 23, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kyle is a member of the East Baton Rouge Parish Republican Executive Committee.
In 2007, as the deputy chairman of the [[Louisiana Republican Party]] under chairman [[Roger F. Villere, Jr.]], Kyle worked for the unsuccessful GOP candidate for Louisiana [[attorney general]], [[Royal Alexander]] of [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], who was handily defeated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], [[Buddy Caldwell]] of [[Tallulah, Louisiana|Tallulah]]. The GOP claimed that Caldwell spent public funds for personal uses and that he cursed and threatened Dan Kyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centrallapolitics.blogspot.com/2007/10/continuing-smear-campaign-of-dan-kyle.html|title=Central La. Politics: "Continuing Smear Campaign of Dan Kyle against Buddy Caldwell", October 7, 2007|publisher=centrallapolitics.blogspot.com|accessdate=November 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Kyle along with another Republican, Wayne Carter, a parish council member, and a Democrat, Ron Johnson, ran unsuccessfully for the mayor-presidency of East Baton Rouge Parish but was handily defeated by the [[incumbent]] Democrat [[Kip Holden]], an African American who scored his second term in the executive office. Kyle called for the establishment of a public bus system to help with traffic congestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://www.wafb.com/global/story.asp?S=9063445|title=Keitha Nelson, "Mayoral candidates outline transportation ideas", September 24, 2008|publisher=[[WAFB-TV]] News|accessdate=November 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle criticized Holden's bond issue as an example of "tax-and-spend philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.225batonrouge.com/news/2008/aug/28/kips-taxing-plan/|title=Jeremy Alford, "Kip's taxing plan", August 28, 2009|publisher=225batonrouge.com|accessdate=November 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle ran a weak second in the mayor-parish presidency, having polled 12,886 votes (12.2 percent). Holden received 75,450 (71.2 percent) and Carter polled 11,341 (10.7 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcpr&amp;rqsdta=10040817|title=Louisiana election returns, October 4, 2008|publisher=sos.louisiana.gov|accessdate=November 23, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holden won in 2004 when he defeated the incumbent Republican Mayor-President [[Bobby Simpson (Louisiana politician)|Bobby R. Simpson]].

In June 2009, as treasurer of the Louisiana GOP, Kyle became one of the directors of a national [[U.S. President|presidential]] fund-raising effort promoting Governor [[Bobby Jindal]]. According to Kyle, the group hopes to raise $60 million to persuade Jindal to seek the 2012 party nomination.&lt;ref name=jindal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/48123092.html|title=Michelle Millhollon, "Official pulls out of Jindal group", June 16, 2009|publisher=''[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]''|accessdate=November 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others on the committee are former State Representative [[Woody Jenkins]] and [[U.S. Representative]] [[Steve Scalise]]. Former Republican [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Senator]] [[Tom Schedler]] of [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]], had his name removed from the group, not because he opposes Jindal but because such fund-raising activity could conflict with Schedler's role as first assistant to Louisiana Secretary of State [[Jay Dardenne]].&lt;ref name=jindal/&gt;

In October 2009, Kyle was named chief financial officer for Southern Star Amusement, Inc., a startup company which seeks to redevelop the [[Six Flags New Orleans]] theme park, closed since [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck in August 2005. Southern Star plans to construct a water and theme park at the former Six Flags site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbrz.com/news/former-legislative-auditor-gets-new-position/|title="Former legislative auditor gets new position", October 20, 2009|publisher=[[WBRZ-TV]] News|accessdate=November 23, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723003132/http://www.wbrz.com/news/former-legislative-auditor-gets-new-position/#|archive-date=2011-07-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kyle, whose place of birth is not known, entered the work force at the age of fourteen in 1951, at the time of his father's death. He laid bricks and worked in retail to provide for his family and to earn his way through college.&lt;ref name=campaigns/&gt; He is married to the former Connie Musick (born 1943). The couple has two sons, Alfred Daniel Kyle (born 1966) and Ronald Glen Kyle (born 1969), both of Baton Rouge. At some point prior to coming to Baton Rouge, Kyle had resided in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]], Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;People Search &amp; Background Check&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle received his Bachelor of Science in accounting in 1959 from [[Southern Arkansas University]] in [[Magnolia, Arkansas|Magnolia]]. He then procured an [[MBA]] in 1961 and a Ph.D. in business administration in 1968, both from the [[University of Arkansas]] at [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]]. The Kyles are active in the First [[United Methodist]] Church of Baton Rouge since they moved to the state capital in 1968.&lt;ref name=campaigns/&gt;

In his 2003 race for insurance commissioner, Kyle summed up his political motivation, accordingly.

"Louisiana is my home. ... Louisiana is my passion. Hard economic times has split up too many families and forced our children to search for jobs in other states. ... I will fight to keep our children and grandchildren in Louisiana . . . it will take my experience, integrity, and leadership to rid this state of corruption, create an economic climate for growth, and get this state off the bottom."&lt;ref name=campaigns/&gt;

'''Dimitrios Pavlos Giannakopoulos''' (alternate spellings: Dimitris Giannacopoulos) ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Δημήτρης Παύλος Γιαννακόπουλος) is a [[Greece|Greek]] [[businessman]], vice-president of the Board of Directors and Deputy CEO of [[Vianex S.A.|VIANEX]] and major shareholder of [[Greek Basket League]] club [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos Athens]].&lt;ref name=intro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vianex.gr/etairia/sub-diarthrwsh.|title=Vianex|website=Vianex.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biographical information ==
Dimitris Giannakopoulos is [[Pavlos Giannakopoulos]]’ son and [[Thanasis Giannakopoulos]]’s nephew, owners of [[Vianex S.A.|VIANEX]], the largest Greek pharmaceutical company today. The family’s engagement in the pharmaceutical sector began with his grandfather, Dimitris Giannakopoulos from [[Sellasia]] in [[Laconia]], who in 1924 opened a pharmacy in the centre of Athens.

In 1971, Pavlos Giannakopoulos founded VIANEX. In 2012, despite the Greek financial crisis, the company announced net sales of up to €240,200,000. He is now the heir of the dynasty built by his father and his uncles, including both VIANEX and [[Panathinaikos B.C.]], marking the emergence of the new generation in particularly difficult times. In 2004, he was made first vice-president at VIANEX, while since January 2012, he has also assumed the office of Deputy CEO.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

He is married to Ioanna Marosouli, with whom he has two children.

== Business activity ==
Dimitris Giannakopoulos took on the family business from his father, Pavlos, in January 2012, when he became Deputy CEO, additionally to being vice-president of the Board of Directors of VIANEX.

The company entered the new era under Dimitris Giannakopoulos' management, that was connected with the increase of openness and the conclusion of important deals, either new ones or renewals of old ones. In July 2013, on the occasion of the announcement of the cooperation between VIANEX and [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]], for the production of the inject-able antibiotic Vancomycin on the premises of VIANEX in China, and the export of 100% of the production to the Chinese market, Pavlos Giannakopoulos stated: "I handed over to him the reigns of the largest Greek pharmaceutical company in the country, and I am convinced he will someday turn it into the largest pharmaceutical company even abroad". VIANEX's goals include expansion to other foreign markets as well, such as [[South Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[Japan]], and Arabic countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.report24.gr/giannakopoulos-epektasi-tis-vianex-se-megales-agores.htm|title=Γιαννακόπουλος… “Επέκταση της ΒΙΑΝΕΞ σε Μεγάλες Αγορές” : Νέα και Ειδήσεις Λακωνίας Πελοπόννησος Report24 – η Εφημερίδα σας|website=Report24.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthview.gr/%CF%80%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B5%CF%87%CF%8C%CE%BC%CE%B5%CE%BD%CE%BF/%CE%AC%CF%81%CE%B8%CF%81%CE%BF/6843/%CE%B4%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%AE%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%BF] {{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VIANEX received an award for its export orientation in the Active Greece Awards 2015. Furthermore, its portfolio comprises other significant awards, such as the [[Diamonds of the Greek Economy]] business award in 2013 and 2015, as well as Salux Index 2014. It is worth mentioning also the award in the Health &amp; Safety Awards 2015, for the best practices in Health and Security in the workplace. The company won the "VIANEX Integrated Health and Safety Quality Program", the ultimate distinction in the "Pharmaceutical Companies" business sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capital.gr/story/2155825|title=Βιανέξ - Λίλλυ: 'Made in Greece' φάρμακα στην Κίνα|website=Capital.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tovima.gr/finance/article/?aid=649983|title=tovima.gr - Τα φάρμακα από την ελληνική ΒΙΑΝΕΞ ταξιδεύουν στην Κίνα|website=Tovima.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onmed.gr/farmako/item/321906-vravefsi-gia-tin-vianeks-sta-salus-index-2014#ixzz3pDekvVJs|title=Βράβευση για την ΒΙΑΝΕΞ στα «Salus Index 2014»|first=Νατάσσα Ν.|last=Σπαγαδώρου|date=13 November 2014|website=Onmed.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Dimitris Giannakopoulos has stated to the press on numerous occasions, VIANEX neither let any employees go, nor did it decrease salaries, despite the financial crisis in Greece. The economic size of VIANEX shrunk; however, its employees "have stood by the company and contributed to achieving high profits over the last years. Thus we, the management, are obligated to support our people, regardless of the economic performance", Dimitris Giannakopoulos stated in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathimerini.gr/791939/article/oikonomia/epixeirhseis/ta3ideyoyn-sthn-kina-ta-farmaka-ths-viane3|title=Ταξιδεύουν στην Κίνα τα φάρμακα της Βιανέξ - Kathimerini|website=Kathimerini.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ygeia360.gr/el/companies/item/17815-diamonds-of-the-greek-economy-2015-diakrish-gia-thn-bianex-# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-11-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120060558/http://www.ygeia360.gr/el/companies/item/17815-diamonds-of-the-greek-economy-2015-diakrish-gia-thn-bianex-# |archive-date=2015-11-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kourdistoportocali.com/post/21727/dhm-giannakopoylos-bianeks-gt-to-manifesto-toy-epixeirhmatia-sthn-ekdhlwsh-ths-statbank-diamonds-2013# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-11-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120010947/http://kourdistoportocali.com/post/21727/dhm-giannakopoylos-bianeks-gt-to-manifesto-toy-epixeirhmatia-sthn-ekdhlwsh-ths-statbank-diamonds-2013# |archive-date=2015-11-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social contribution ==
Dimitris Giannakopoulos has engaged in a series of important initiatives with the intention to contribute to Greek society through VIANEX, [[Panathinaikos B.C.]], and the electronic media company DPG Group, which he also owns.

To raise awareness among the population, regarding the issue of cardiovascular disease, VIANEX donated 15,000 bad cholesterol tests within the context of the extended Panhellenic Patient Support Project "Measure LDL with us", under the auspices of the Hellenic Society of Lipidology, Atherosclerosis and Vascular Disease (E.E.L.I.A.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stogiatro.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=35915:vianeks-dwrean-eksetaseis-xolhsterolhs-se-olh-thn-ellada&amp;catid=370:etairika-nea&amp;Itemid=242|title=stogiatro - ΒΙΑΝΕΞ: Δωρεάν εξετάσεις χοληστερόλης σε όλη την Ελλάδα|website=Stogiatro.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, VIANEX donated 300 vaccines to the Social Clinic and Pharmacy of
the diocese of Arkalochori, Kastelli &amp; Viannos, and the Municipality of Minoa Pediadas in Crete, aiming to defend child health, as well as safeguard public health.  DPG offered support to the Mitera - Centre for Child Protection of Attica; its people visited the infant centre and the dormitories of the premises, to give away presents for Christmas, such as candy, clothes, shoes, Sudocream lotions, as well as [[Panathinaikos]] blankets from the PAO Shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbomb.gr/ellada/news/story/384368/dpg-digital-media--kai-panathinaikos-sto-pleyro-toy-idrymatos-mitera|title=DPG Digital Media  και Παναθηναϊκός στο πλευρό του ιδρύματος «Μητέρα»|first=|last=Newsbomb|date=20 December 2013|website=Newsbomb.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://biologikaorganikaproionta.com/health/145653/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-11-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120014220/http://biologikaorganikaproionta.com/health/145653/# |archive-date=2015-11-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it responded to the invitation of [[Make-A-Wish Foundation|Make-a-Wish foundation]] (Make-a-Wish Greece), by taking part in the charity dinner organized at the [[Benaki Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbomb.gr/ellada/news/story/600260/mia-eyxi-poy-egine-pragmatikotita|title=Μια ...ευχή που έγινε πραγματικότητα|first=|last=Newsbomb|date=25 June 2015|website=Newsbomb.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panathinaikos B.C. and Dimitris Giannakopoulos donated five cutting-edge wheelchairs to the Patriotic Institution of Social Welfare (PIKPA) of Voula, for the basketball team of the institution during the National Championship of Wheelchair Basketball.  The President of the Panhellenic Association of Paraplegics (PA.S.PA) awarded Dimitris Giannakopoulos for his social contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsitamea.gr/%CE%9F-%CE%94-%CE%93%CE%B9%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82-%CE%B4%CF%8E%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%B5-%CF%80%CE%AD%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%B5-%CE%B1%CE%BC%CE%B1%CE%BE%CE%AF|title=Ο Δ.Γιαννακόπουλος δώρισε πέντε αμαξίδια τελευταίας τεχνολογίας στο ΠΙΚΠΑ Βούλας - Newsitamea|date=21 September 2013|website=Newsitamea.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Panathinaikos B.C. ==
In 2012, Dimitris Giannakopoulos took charge of Panathinaikos B.C., after his father, Pavlos, and his uncle, Thanasis, who managed the club before him.

During his Presidency, the team won two consecutive Greek doubles ([[Greek Basket League]] championship and [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]]). However, in December 2014, he resigned from the club's President position, giving his seat to Manos Papadopoulos. He claimed to have been forced to proceed to such a move because of the constant sanctions and fines imposed on the club by the Greek State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport-fm.gr/article/basket/giannakopoulos/796870|title=Αποχώρησε… τυπικά από την ΚΑΕ ο Γιαννακόπουλος!|website=Sport-fm.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-standing success in the management of web communication media for DPG was sealed by its cooperation with [[CNN]].

=== CNN Greece ===
DPG, along with the international news giant [[CNN]], established [http://www.cnn.gr CNN.gr]. Dimitris Giannakopoulos, the President of DPG Group, stated on the occasion of the cooperation announcement: "We are particularly pleased to become members of the international CNN family through this strategic cooperation. CNN.gr aims to provide to the Greek-speaking audience immediate and accurate Greek and international news, with the unique seal of quality provided by CNN, bringing at the same time the Greek diaspora closer to the motherland. In times marked by very important developments for Greece, we invest in a platform which will responsibly serve the increasing demand of the audience for accurate, timely, and quality information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2015/07/30/cnn-gr-to-launch-online-and-on-mobile/|title=CNN.GR TO LAUNCH ONLINE AND ON MOBILE|website=cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FairShare''' is an idea for a voluntary [[investment]]-based [[patronage]] system to replace [[patents]] and [[copyright]] while still ensuring that artists are fairly compensated.  It was designed by [[Freenet]] creator [[Ian Clarke (computer scientist)|Ian Clarke]], [[Steven Starr]] and Rob Kramer in 2000, in response to allegations that artists would not receive adequate compensation for their work without enforceable copyrights. Starr came up with the name.

In the FairShare system, the investor/patrons would provide [[venture capital]].  Clarke envisions that 45% of the money invested in a given artist would go directly to that artist, while another 45% would be given to previous investors.  The remaining 10% would be kept by the maintainers of each FairShare service company.

In some ways this model is similar to a [[pyramid scheme]], but Clarke counters that a vital difference is that nobody would be promised a return on their investment.  He argues that regardless of any profits, each patron would have the satisfaction of knowing that they supported an artist whose work they appreciate.  Also, earlier investors would profit more, thus rewarding them for investing in artists before they became more popular.  The early investors would serve a similar role to studios' talent scouts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4964">'''Indirect costs''' are costs that are not directly accountable to a [[cost object]] (such as a particular project, facility, function or product). Indirect costs may be either fixed or variable. Indirect costs include administration, personnel and security costs. These are those costs which are not directly related to production. Some indirect costs may be [[overhead (business)|overhead]]. But some overhead costs can be directly attributed to a project and are direct costs.

There are two types of indirect costs. One are the fixed indirect costs which contains activities or costs that are fixed for a particular project or company like transportation of labor to the working site, building temporary roads, etc. The other are recurring indirect costs which contains activities that repeat for a particular company like maintenance of records or payment of salaries.

==Indirect vs direct costs==
Most [[cost estimate]]s are broken down into direct costs and indirect costs.

Direct costs are directly attributable to the  object and it is financially feasible to do so. In construction, the costs of materials, labor, equipment, etc., and all directly involved efforts or expenses for the cost object are direct costs. In manufacturing or other non-construction industries the portion of operating costs that is directly assignable to a specific product or process is a direct cost.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard AACE International Recommended Practice No. 10S-90 COST ENGINEERING TERMINOLOGY TCM Framework: General Reference,'' Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering International, 2010, Pg 35&lt;/ref&gt; Direct costs are those for activities or services that benefit specific projects, for example salaries for project staff and materials required for a particular project. Because these activities are easily traced to projects, their costs are usually charged to projects on an item-by-item basis.

Indirect costs are, but not necessarily, not directly attributable to a cost object. It should be financially infeasible to do so. Indirect costs are typically allocated to a cost object on some basis. In construction, all costs which are required for completion of the installation, but are not directly attributable to the cost object are indirect, such as overhead. In manufacturing, costs not directly assignable to the end product or process are indirect. These may be costs for management, insurance, taxes, or maintenance, for example.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard AACE International Recommended Practice No. 10S-90 COST ENGINEERING TERMINOLOGY TCM Framework: General Reference,'' Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering International, 2010, Pg 49&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect costs are those for activities or services that benefit more than one project. Their precise benefits to a specific project are often difficult or impossible to trace. For example, it may be difficult to determine precisely how the activities of the director of an organization benefit a specific project. Indirect costs do not vary substantially within certain production volumes or other indicators of activity, and so they may sometimes be considered to be fixed costs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accountingtools.com/questions-and-answers/what-are-indirect-costs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to justify the handling of almost any kind of cost as either direct or indirect. Labor costs, for example, can be indirect, as in the case of maintenance personnel and executive officers; or they can be direct, as in the case of project staff members. Similarly, materials such as miscellaneous supplies purchased in bulk—pencils, pens, paper—are typically handled as indirect costs, while materials required for specific projects are charged as direct costs.

==Examples==
Be cautious here, because the nature of the cost depends on the industry. For example, fuel cost in a telecom is usually allocated as an indirect cost, while for an airliner it is a direct cost.

===Costs usually charged directly===
* Salary/wages
* Consultants
* Materials
* Tools
* Transport
* Labor
* Direct materials
* PPC
* Any kind of subcontract which is attributable to direct works but the specific company does not possess the required skill

===Costs either charged directly or allocated indirectly===
* Directors Salary (this is usually an indirect cost)
* Electricity (mostly if it needs allocation it is always indirect)

Note that if electricity is not used as primary source for production then electricity cost will be treated as utility and is always indirect. For example, if electricity is required to run the boiler which in turn generates steam, then electricity which needs to be allocated directly.

===Costs usually allocated indirectly===
* Indirect costs related to transport
* Administration cost
* Selling &amp; distribution cost
* Office cost
* Security cost

'''Internal communications''' ('''IC''') is the function responsible for effective [[communications]] among participants within an [[organization]]. The scope of the function varies by organization and practitioner, from producing and delivering messages and campaigns on behalf of management, to facilitating two-way dialogue and developing the communication skills of the organization's participants.

Modern understanding of internal communications is a field of its own and draws on the theory and practice of related professions, not least [[journalism]], [[knowledge management]], [[public relations]] (e.g., [[media relations]]), [[marketing]] and [[human resource management|human resources]], as well as wider [[organizational studies]],  [[communication theory]], [[social psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[political science]].

==History of internal communications==
[[Image:Lady Lever Art Gallery, Queen Mary's Drive, Port Sunlight - geograph.org.uk - 1491519.jpg|thumb|right|Lady Lever Art Gallery, built in 1888 as part of a model village for the workers of the Lever's soap factory - [[Port Sunlight]], UK]]
Large industrial organizations have a long history of promoting pride and a sense of unity among the employees of the company, evidenced in the cultural productions of Victorian-era soap manufacturers as far apart as the UK's Lever Brothers (right) and the [[Larkin Administration Building|Larkin Soap Company]] of Buffalo, New York.

Internal communications is fundamentally a management discipline, but as a discrete discipline of organizational theory it is correspondingly young. Stanford associate professor Alex Heron's ''Sharing Information with Employees'' (1943) is an outlier among texts which focus solely on the factors involved. Theorization in academic papers accelerated in the 1970s, but mainstream management texts mostly post-date 1990.

Writing in 2013, Ruck and Yaxley explore how the discipline evolved from the days of employee publications in the late 19th century.  As organisations became more complex, the impetus to communicate with employees grew and led to the emergence of an increasingly specialised discipline.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exploringinternalcommunication.com/what-can-we-learn-from-the-history-of-internal-communication/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of IC in the organization==

The purpose that a formally appointed IC manager or IC team will serve within a given organization will depend on the business context. In one, the IC function may perform the role of 'internal marketing' (i.e., attempting to win participants over to the management vision of the organization); in another, it might perform a 'logistical' service as channel manager; in a third, it might act principally as strategic adviser.

There is a practical distinction to make between managed communication and regular interactions among teams or between managers and subordinates. Minzberg&lt;ref&gt;cited in Hargie O and Tourish D eds, (2004) Handbook of Communication Audits for Organisations London Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; talks about the fact that communicating is intrinsic to the work of a manager - especially so in an [[information society]]. Interpersonal communications in the workplace are explored by writers such as Phillip Clampitt.&lt;ref&gt;Clampitt P, Communicating for Managerial Effectiveness, Sage 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of reasons why organisations should be concerned with internal communication. Employees are the heart and soul of an organization, thus it’s critical to pay attention to their needs. An engaged and committed employee work force increases and drives business results. Employee engagement encourages higher employee performance, results in lower turnover and offers competitive advantage. Even in a difficult economy, companies need to inspire and retain high performers.

Importantly, there is commonly a legal requirement for organizations to communicate with their workers.  In Europe, for example, the EU has made very specific provision about workers' rights to be informed and consulted with Directive 94/45/EC ([[Works council#European Works Council|Works Council]]).

Effective internal communications is commonly understood by practitioners to improve [[employee engagement]] (see, for example, the UK government-sponsored Macleod Report&lt;ref&gt;Macleod D,  Clarke N (2009) ''Engaging for Success: enhancing performance through employee engagement'', Department for Business Innovation and Skills, www.bis.gov.uk, http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file52215.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) and therefore to add significant value to organizations on metrics from productivity to customer research.

As noted in Quirke (2008):&lt;ref name="Quirke"&gt;Quirke, B. (2008). "Making the Connections; using Internal Communications to turn strategy into action", Burlington, VT: Gower Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt; "Traditionally, internal communications has focused on the announcement of management conclusions and the packaging of management thinking into messages for mass distribution to the 'troops'". Research indicates a limit to the value of this '[[broadcasting]]' model of IC. Without [[feedback]] loops and harnessing the active involvement and mediation skills of frontline supervisors or team leaders, broadcasting tends to be more effective at influencing senior and middle managers than frontline employees - see, e.g., Larkin and Larkin (1994).&lt;ref name="Larkin"&gt;Larkin, TJ and Larkin S. (1994). "Communicating Change: winning employee support for new business goals", New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the IC function matures within the organization, then, it may come to play a wider role in facilitating conversations "upwards", "downwards" and "across" the organization, ''per'' Stohl (1995).&lt;ref&gt;Stohl, C. (1995). "Organizational Communication: connectedness in action", Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations increasingly see IC as playing a role in external reputation management. Joep Cornelissen in his book ''Corporate Communications''&lt;ref&gt;Cornelissen, J. (2004). ''Corporate Communication: a guide to theory and practice", Thousand Oaks, CA: Sge Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; touches on the relationship between reputation and internal conversations. This trend reaches its full potential with the arrival of new 'norms' and customer expectations around [[social media]], for example in the work of Scoble and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Scoble R, Israel S. (2006) ''Naked Conversations: how blogs are changing the way businesses talk to customers'', Hoboken NJ, John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt; Market researchers MORI&lt;ref&gt;Corporate responsibility: The communication challenge
Jenny Dawkins ''Journal of Communication Management'', 2004; p.108&lt;/ref&gt; have likewise highlighted the effects of employee advocacy on an organisation's external reputation.

IC managers try to get senior leaders to think strategically about how management decisions can be perceived internally and externally.  The focus of IC is often to ensure that employees can support a decision and understand how it impacts their work. An engaged employee is someone who is fully involved in, committed, and enthusiastic about his or her work. It’s the extent to which employees put discretionary effort into their work. Involvement of hearts as well as minds. The ability to work as a team across disciplines and functions. The understanding and commitment to achieving company goals and business context. Employee engagement speaks Engaged Employees Are More Productive to the level of trust in leadership, a belief that decisions are made in the best interests of the organization and its employees, and the level to which employees feel valued and appreciated. The more engaged, committed and inspired an employee is, the higher the employee performance, and the more impact on the bottom line.

==Internal communication strategy==

There are two sides to strategy in internal communications. In the first instance there is the organization's strategy — what it hopes to achieve and how it plans to go about achieving it. That strategy will be supported and, to some extent, delivered through effective internal communications.

In this context internal communication can help on several different levels:

* Tell: simply informing people of the direction, non-negotiable
* Sell: anticipating some form of backlash, requiring some persuasion
* Consult: seeking specific areas of input to the decision-making process
* Involve: seeking varying degrees of involvement and co-creation

Secondly, and more importantly, internal communications needs a strategy of its own. It should be positioned more than a simple plan of tactical interventions in support of business activities. The strategy should consider the following:

* Market: What does the organization know about its audiences' needs? How should its audiences be segmented?
* Message: What is it the organization's message is trying to achieve? In what tone should it be conveyed?
* Media: Which channels work best for the different audience segments? How will it maximize reach and cut-through? Are there clear editorial guidelines for each?
* Measurement: Are there clearly defined success criteria? What are the leading and lagging measures? As well as informing all of the other three M's, it should be used to demonstrate value and measures of performance (ROI, message penetration, hit rates, quality of feedback, etc.)

The strategy will inform the best way to organize effective communications.

Five general modes of IC practice are itemised below, ranked loosely according to their position along a spectrum from ''tactical'' to ''strategic'' activities.
[[Image:Tactical strategic IC.jpg|thumb|right|The modes of IC practice, arranged along a spectrum from the tactical to the strategic]]

===Message distribution===
Formal channels typically fall into one of four broad categories:{{cn|date=September 2018}}
*'''Electronic''': Communications that are delivered and/or accessed electronically, either by computer, telephone, television or other devices. Examples include [[E-mail|email]], [[intranet]], video and [[webcast]]s, [[DVD]], electronic [[newsletter]]s, [[podcast]]s, [[blog]]s, [[wiki]]s, [[voicemail]], conference calls, [[SMS]] text messaging, [[screensaver]] messaging, desktop news feeds, internal social media tools and team chat tools.

*'''Print''': Paper-based communications. Examples include [[magazine]]s, newsletters, brochures, postcards and other 'desk drops', posters, memos, communication packs or 'toolkits' for line managers, etc.
*'''Face-to-face''': One-to-one and one-to-many forums where people are physically present. Examples include a 'cascade' of team meetings or briefings, conferences, site visits, 'back to the floor', consultation forums, 'brown bag' lunches, round-table discussions, 'town meetings', etc.
*'''Workspace''': The working environment. Examples include notice boards, plasma and LCD screens, accessories (e.g.: mousemats), window decals, etc.

Informal channels reflect the non-linear dynamics of a [[social network]] and can be as influential, if not more so, than official channels, often more likely to stimulate and create [[discussion]] and [[dialogue]]. The channels may manifest themselves via the rumour-mill, water-cooler conversations, social networking, graffiti, spoof newsletters, etc.

==== Selecting channels ====
One of the key challenges any internal communicator will face is how to select the right channels - and the right mix of channels - for both the audience and the message. Bill Quirke&lt;ref name="Quirke"/&gt; offers a simplistic guide; See Weick&lt;ref&gt;Weick, K.E. (1995) "Sensemaking in Organizations", Thousands Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; for some theoretical grounds for this basic insight.

The practical considerations are:
*'''Availability''': what channels either already exist within the organisation or can be introduced effectively?
*'''Audience''': who are they, where are they based, how do they prefer to access information and how effective will the proposed channel be in reaching them and engaging them?
*'''Objectives''': what does the organisation want people to learn, think, feel or do as a result of the message?
*'''Content''': what is the context and substance of the message? (for example, sensitive messages may need to be communicated face-to-face, rather than by text message)
*'''Timing''': how urgent is the message? (for example, communications in times of crisis which require quick dissemination of important messages)

==== Traffic control ====
A typical large organisation IC function will be concerned to monitor and limit the ''quantity'' of information flowing through each internal channel, prioritising according to the relevance of a given message to the audience implicated in that channel, as well as the urgency and impact of the message. Such organisations typically face a risk that channels (such as [[intranet]] news, or [[email]]) are over-used for inappropriate, low value messages, causing vital audience groups to [[spam filter|filter]] them out.

==== Channel development and administration ====
IC teams will often (but not always) hold responsibility for the administration and development of several of the organisation's communications channels. The range of media available is wide - and growing fast with new electronic media. Initially, IC tends to focus on the existing resources of the organization, typically an [[intranet]], email distributions, and newsletters.

One common element of channel development and administration involves managing supplier relationships - agencies external to the organization typically specialise in one main channel area, such as audiovisual, or print production.

==== Line manager 'cascade' ====
Sending information down the line to local supervisors, expecting them to deliver it without any corruption, interpretation or deviation has long been the main focus of 'cascaded' internal communications (for example, UK guidance from The Industrial Society, now the [http://www.theworkfoundation.com/aboutus/ourhistory.aspx Work Foundation], focused on giving managers very clear instructions about what to say and how to say it). However, in recent years thinking has evolved and literature now concentrates on empowering managers to facilitate discussion rather than cascade management of messages which will have little authority or impact. This is a particularly strong theme in the writing of TJ and Sandar Larkin.&lt;ref name="Larkin"/&gt; Clampitt (2005) lists three approaches managers use to communicate with their employees.&lt;ref&gt;Clampitt, P. (2005). ''Communicating for Managerial Effectiveness'', Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc&lt;/ref&gt;

Employee communication is an important skill for all line managers, irrespective of their seniority.  Like any skill it requires training and development.  Often, organisations do not invest the appropriate amount of time and effort in developing managers' communications skills. Too often this leads to managers abdicating responsibility for communications to their 'internal communications department' and a lack of confidence in facilitating discussion in their teams. This raises debate around the following issues:
* The nature of supervisory relationships and organisational communication
* The potency of managers as a channel of official communications
* How best to support managers in their roles

FitzPatrick and Valskov argue that strong manager communication systems attempt to address five essential issues:
* Do managers understand that communication is part of their role - in general and on specific occasions or topics?
* Do managers have access to more detailed background or context - rather than just be supplied with the same material as their teams?
* Have managers received training or development to support their role?
* Are manager supplied with materials to make their task easier?
* What attention is given to their feedback?&lt;ref&gt;FitzPatrick L &amp; Valskov V Internal Communication; a manual for practitioners, Kogan Page 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social media ====

Social media is becoming increasingly discussed in the field of internal communication. However, there is little documented, academic evidence of where it is being used successfully as part of a planned campaign of employee communications, and it is often confused with digital media. There are case studies published on a number of commercial websites including www.simply-communicate.com and www.melcrum.com, and there is a useful chapter on the subject by Tracy Playle in Ruck's ''Exploring Internal Communication''.

==== Other collaborative software ====

Since 2012, several communication technologies usually classified as workplace group chat apps or [[collaborative software]] have emerged.

===Message design and production===
Basic IC services to an organization begin with editorial services - either fine-tuning messages drafted by participants in the organization, or drafting new material on their behalf. IC practitioners might simply correct basic grammar, etc., especially in organisations where many participants may be operating in their second or third language. Or they might re-work it to conform to [[Style guide|house style]] or its branded equivalent, 'tone of voice'. The skillset involved relates closely to media professions such as [[journalism]], [[copywriting]] and [[Film production|film]] or [[Printing|print]] production. Message design may be iterative, or involve a range of participants in an approvals process.

===Project communications===
IC practitioners may be [[seconded]] to a specific project team, to support the stages of the project that carry a communications or engagement component. Project communicators might produce a schedule of communication objectives and milestones for the project; a map of vital stakeholders (senior individuals or large groups / segments of the overall population); and a message framework to guide project participants towards a single, coherent message about their work. They might also contribute to the project's aggregate risks 'log' on the reputational risks, and work-up contingency plans covering unintended situations.

==== Change communications ====
Most writers on the subject of communications talk about the idea of change.  Most intentional communication takes place with the aim of effecting some kind of change or another.  However, many practitioners in internal communications make a distinction between change and transformation.

Drawing on the work of writers such as William Bridges, practitioners talk of 'change' as the act of altering something within an organisation (such as the introduction of a new IT system or the closure of an office) and they describe 'transition' as the process through which an individual passes as part of the process of coping with change.  The use of the two terms interchangeably causes some confusion.  Communicators who specialise in change communications tend to be interested in behaviour change and will draw heavily on psychological models.

There are important contributions made to the debate about practice in this area by Herrero&lt;ref&gt;Herrero, L. "Viral change." Beaconsfield, UK: Meetingminds/The Chalfont Project (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and Quike.&lt;ref&gt;Quirke, Bill. Communicating corporate change: A practical guide to communication and corporate strategy. McGraw-Hill, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Crisis communications ====
Organizations occasionally face unplanned reputational crises which can destroy brand value or even finish the organization. At such moments, the support of the internal constituency becomes especially valuable, as employees' friends and relatives seek their account of events, and as talented and motivated participants consider whether or not to remain with the organization.

As with [[media relations]] and [[Public relations|PR]], the role IC plays in a crisis can be decisive for the success or failure of an organization, as it responds to a critical challenge. Organizations with a mature IC function may have contingency planning in place, ready to be tailored to the particulars of the situation. They are also more likely to have 'well flexed', well-rehearsed line management communications capability, making crisis communications more effective. Less mature IC functions may find it difficult to bring senior leaders' attention to the internal audience, when critical stakeholders such as investors or customers appear more likely to desert the organization.

Although unplanned and usually under-resourced, the quality of an IC function's response in a crisis often has a decisive impact in the maturing of an IC function within an organization. Effective responses bring IC up the list of priorities for senior leaders, following the crisis.

===Internal communication roles===

In recent years the practice of internal communications has professionalised.

In common with the [[Dave Ulrich|Ulrich model]] for [[human resources]] practice, IC may be delivered via a 'business partnering' relationship, acting as adviser to a given function or unit on IC issues relevant to the delivery of their strategic plans and projects. As a representative of the audiences with a stake in the developments under discussion, this can be both an awkward and a privileged position to occupy, requiring skills of diplomacy and objectivity.

==IC associations and accreditation==
There is not yet a globally recognised internal communication qualification, though various training courses and formal qualifications have been established to create and maintain standards.

In the UK, the accreditation bodies representing the profession offer competing qualifications. The UK's [[Chartered Institute of Public Relations]] offers training and qualifications in internal communications including Diploma and Certificate courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cipr.co.uk/courses/internal-communication-certificate |title=Internal Communication Certificate &amp;#124; Chartered Institute of Public Relations |publisher=Cipr.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also postgraduate Diploma or Masters programmes in Internal Communications Management at [[Kingston University]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingston.ac.uk/postgraduate-course/internal-communication-management-ma/ |title=Internal Communication Management Masters (MA) - London postgraduate courses - Kingston University London |publisher=Kingston.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, related courses are available at the [[University of Lugano]] in Switzerland and [[Rotterdam School of Management]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Susanna Marco |url=http://www.rsm.nl/executive-education/open-programmes/programmes/corporate-communication/employee-communication/overview/ |title=Employee Communication - Employee Communication - Corporate Communication - Programmes - Open Programmes - Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University |publisher=Rsm.nl |date= |accessdate=2014-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, internal communications is still a very nascent field with few specialists in more developed economies such as Singapore and Hong Kong, some accredited by the Singapore Business Advisors and Consultants Council.

Professional IC associations include the [[Institute of Internal Communication]], the [[International Association of Business Communicators]] (IABC), and others. In 2013, IABC closed its Accredited Business Communicator qualification, but planned to launch a Certification Programme for Strategic Communicators in Autumn 2014.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Synonyms==
IC may variously be referred to as: employee communications, [[employee engagement]], [[employee relations]], internal marketing, company communications, staff communication. Responsibility for IC may sit within various established functions, including [[marketing]], [[corporate communications]], transformation, [[Human resources|HR]] and the CEO office. Internal communications functions can require several skills, e.g.: writing, marketing, event organisation, web production, facilitation, [[advertising]], stakeholder management, [[corporate social responsibility]], [[brand management|branding]] and communications training.

'''Sir James Sivewright''' K.C.M.G. (1848&amp;ndash;1916) was a businessman and politician of the [[Cape Colony]], [[South Africa]]. He was a strong political ally of [[Cecil Rhodes]] and, as his cabinet minister, was implicated in the "Logan" corruption scandal that led to the fall of the first Rhodes government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fochaberians.com/jsivewright.html|title=Sir James Sivewright KCMG|website=www.fochaberians.com|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life==
James Sivewright was born in [[Fochabers]], [[Scotland]]. Graduating from the University of Aberdeen he entered the British Postal Service and co-authored the ''Textbook in Telegraphy'', a book that became a standard text book on the topic for a considerable time. 

==Telegraphy in the Cape==
He emigrated to the Cape Colony in 1877 as a telegraphy expert. The Cape had recently wrested a degree of independence from Britain under the "[[Responsible Government]]" system, and its first [[Prime Minister]] [[John Molteno]] was embarking on a massive expansion in the country's infrastructure. Sivewright was one of the telegraphy experts which the Cape government imported to develop a telecommunications system for the country. From 1877 Sivewright helped to plan and construct the telegraphy networks for the Cape Colony, and then, up until 1881 likewise for the Transvaal, the Natal Colony and the Orange Free State.

==Politics and Cecil John Rhodes==
In 1887 Sivewright became involved in politics, after he joined the [[Afrikaner Bond]] in [[Cape Town]], and he was elected as the Bond representative of [[Griqualand East]] in 1888. 

Subsequently, he became immensely influential as an agent of the rising Imperialist politician [[Cecil Rhodes]], within the Afrikaner Bond. He went on to act as an intermediate between Rhodes, and the Bond leader [[Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (Onze Jan)|"Onze Jan" Hofmeyr]]. As Rhodes's right-hand man, he secured the Bond's support for Rhodes to take power in 1890 and become [[Prime Minister]] of the Cape. 

Throughout his career, Sivewright habitually mixed business and politics. In 1891 he secured an agreement for the [[Cape Government Railways]], that gave them a 2-year monopoly on traffic to and from the new goldfields of the Transvaal. As a reward, Sivewright received a [[knighthood]].  

He also built increasingly powerful links with the principal mining tycoons of southern Africa, such as Barney Barnato. Sivewright's business links gained increasing criticism from opposition politicians who accused him of massive corruption.

==The Logan corruption scandal (1892-3)==
[[File:Prime Minister Gordon Spriggs Cabinet - caricature in Cape Register - 1893.jpg|thumb|right|An 1893 cartoon on the Logan Scandal. James Sivewright is depicted on the far right, clutching his dirty linen and proclaiming his honesty.]]
[[File:James Sivewright, Vanity Fair, 1893-06-01.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing of James Sivewright, Vanity Fair, 1893.]]
In 1892, he secured a government contract for his friend and associate James Logan which involved a 15-year monopoly on the catering for the nation's Government-run Railway system. 

The deal was immediately discovered, and a collection of the country's most powerful liberal politicians, including [[JW Sauer]], [[John X. Merriman]] and [[James Rose-Innes]], protested and attacked the deal. Eventually the Rhodes government was forced to cancel the deal, however it nonetheless compensated Logan massively with government money. The liberal politicians then refused to be part of any government that included Sivewright, however Sivewright still had the support of Rhodes and his connections with the Afrikaner Bond which were essential for the maintenance of the Rhodes government. 
The surrounding scandal, and the stand-off that it caused, led to the fall of the first Rhodes Government. 

Sivewright then moved to act as a discrete and unofficial railway diplomat.

==Progressive Party==
After the [[Jameson raid]] split apart the Cape political scene and was subsequently revealed to have been a plot by Cecil Rhodes, the [[Afrikaner Bond]] finally split with Rhodes, whose second government fell. 
Faced with the choice, Sivewright joined the Rhodesian, pro-Imperialist [[Progressive Party (Cape Colony)|"Progressive Party"]]. The move paid off when Rhodesian Prime Minister [[Gordon Sprigg]] gained power, and Sivewright was awarded the Commission of Crown Lands and Public Works. 

He won a seat for Stellenbosch in 1898, standing as a Progressive, but it was soon discovered that his agents had been bribing voters, and he was consequently deposed.

==Later life==
Sivewright then traveled back to Britain but nonetheless kept strong political and business links with South Africa. In 1899, he arranged the Bloemfontein Conference, and he had diverse financial interests in southern Africa that he kept for the rest of his life. 

His reputation for massive corruption never quite faded, and liberal activist [[Olive Schreiner]] recounts that: 
''"when both he (Rhodes) and Sivewright came forward to shake hands, I turned on my heel and went to my house."''

'''Leon Carroll Marshall''' (March 15, 1879 &amp;ndash; March 1966) was an American economist, Professor of Political Economy and fourth dean of the [[Booth School of Business]] from 1909 to 1924, Professor at the Law School of the [[Johns Hopkins University]], and Professor at the [[American University]]. He is known for his works on our economic organization,&lt;ref&gt;Fitts, Charles Tabor, and Fletcher Harper Swift. ''The construction of orientation courses for college freshmen.'' Vol. 2.

== Biography ==
Born in [[Zanesville, Ohio]] in 1879, Marshall in 1900 obtained his BA at the [[Ohio Wesleyan University]], and in 1902 his MA from [[Harvard University]], Later on in 1918 he obtained his law degree at the [[Ohio Wesleyan University]].&lt;ref name="LCMP"&gt;[http://www.american.edu/library/archives/finding_aids/lcmarshall_fa.cfm L. C. Marshall Papers], at american.edu. Accessed Jan. 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall started his academic career at the business school of the University of Chicago, the [[Booth School of Business]], where he became Professor of Political Economy and was fourth dean of the business school from 1909 to 1924. Sequentially he moved to the [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he was professor and director of its Institute of Law from 1928 to 1933. In 1934 Marshall was appointed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] as member of the [[National Labor Board]] and of the [[National Recovery Administration]] to support Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] policies and the "measure and combat the effects of the [[Great Depression]]."&lt;ref name="LCMP"/&gt; He also became a member of the [[National Educational Association]]. From 1936 to 1948 Marshall was Professor of Political Economy at [[American University]] in Washington, D.C.

Marshall wrote several textbooks on Social Studies topics at the secondary school and grade-school level, starting with ''Materials For the Study of Elementary Economics'' in 1913 coauthored with [[James A. Field]] (1879-1927) and [[Chester Whitney Wright]] (1880-1966).&lt;ref name="LCMP"/&gt;

== Work ==
Marshall came into prominence in the years from 1913 to 1919, when he was involved with professor of Economics [[James A. Field]] and the economic historian [[Chester W. Wright]] in "attempts to move economics instruction away from the 'rigorous drill in orthodox theory' or the 'straight-jacket of conventional theory' to a method of instruction emphasizing the development of economic institutions, inquiry into current problems and issues, and fostering of creativity and originality (field 1917). To this end, they produced a book of readings to supplement the usual texts (Marshall, Wright, and Field 1913)."&lt;ref name="MR 2011"&gt;Malcolm Rutherford (2011). ''The Institutionalist Movement in American Economics.'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Readings in Industrial Society,'' 1918 ===
[[File:Readings in industrial society, 1920.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page, 1918/20.]]
In 1918 Marshall published his ''Readings in Industrial Society.'' This work had a heavy emphasis on the institutional development of industrial society, the money economy and financial organization, machine industry, the wage system and the worker, industrial concentration, competition, private property, and social control."&lt;ref name="MR 2011"/&gt;

The work contained reading from founders of the [[institutional economics]] such as [[Thorstein Veblen]], [[Wesley Clair Mitchell]], [[Walton H. Hamilton]], [[Harold G. Moulton]], [[Robert F. Hoxie]], [[John M. Clark]], [[Edwin Cannan]], and [[John A. Hobson]].&lt;ref name="MR 2011"/&gt; He also reprinted diagrams from the work of [[Henry Rogers Seager]], picturing the economic production and distribution from 1904,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1918, p. 23-24)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Nystrom]], picturing the channels of distribution for various lines of goods from 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1918, p. 258)&lt;/ref&gt;

Leon Ardzrooni, known as "Veblen's most faithful disciple",&lt;ref&gt;Thorstein Veblen (1963) ''The Engineers and the Price System.'' p. 33, footnote 34.&lt;/ref&gt; reviewed the book for ''[[Political Science Quarterly]],'' and introduced the work as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As indicated in the subtitle of this formidable volume, the author has brought together a large array of descriptive material for " a study in the structure and functioning of economic organization." Among a considerable number of students in the social sciences the feeling has been growing that economics, as studied in our colleges and universities, lacks the substance and security which is often obtained in other fields of intellectual endeavor by a happy coordination of historical perspective and speculative logomachy. With a view to attain such an end, there have appeared in recent years several volumes of " selected readings " for the study of economics and economic problems. The present one is a creditable addition to this goodly list in the publication of which the University of Chicago Press has taken a leading part.&lt;ref name="LA 1919"&gt;Leon Ardzrooni. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2141692 Reviewed Work: Readings in Industrial Society. by Leon Carroll Marshall]," in: ''Political Science Quarterly.'' Vol. 34, No. 3 (Sep., 1919), pp. 503-505&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Clarence Edwin Ayres]] explicitly regarded "Marshall's book as a contribution to the institutional type of economics."&lt;ref name="MR 2011"/&gt;

=== ''Our economic organization,'' 1921 ===
[[File:Our Economic Organization, 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page, 1921]]
In 1921 Marshall and Leverett S. Lyon (1885-1959) published their "Our economic organization." The main purpose of this book in the field of elementary economics is to present in systematic fashion the structure of economic society under the spur of competition.&lt;ref name="EWG 1921"&gt;Everett W. Goodhue. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1804384 Reviewed Work: Our Economic Organization by Leon C. Marshall, Leverett S. Lyon]," in: ''The American Economic Review,'' Vol. 11, No. 4 (Dec., 1921), pp. 663-665.&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment is necessarily brief on account of the large number of topics to be covered, and also on account of the requirements of an elementary text book. The approach is functional. The authors stated in its preface the purpose is to present economic organization in its functional aspect, to show in some detail not so much what the organization is as how it operates.&lt;ref name="EWG 1921"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The distinguishing feature of the volume is the effort to depict social structures in terms of what they do. The ''functions'', the ''uses'', the ''work'', of banks, of business organization, of [[competition]], of [[division of labour|specialization]]], of [[government]],  of [[scientific management]], of education, and of other multitudinous agencies which together make up our want-gratifying machine, are the matters with which the book is concerned.&lt;ref name = "ML 1921 v)"&gt;Marshal &amp; Lyon (1921, p. v)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And more even specific "it is a study of the devices which exist in industrial society, primarily in terms of their activities, and, quite secondarily, in terms of their structures."&lt;ref name = "ML 1921 v)"/&gt;

==== Economic organization compared to machine; a process approach to economics ====
In a 1921 review of the work ''The American Economic Review,'' by Everett Walton Goodhue (1878-1940s), Professor of Sociology and Economics at [[Colgate University]],&lt;ref&gt;New York (State). Legislature. Senate (1910). ''Documents of the Senate of the State of New York.'' p. 925&lt;/ref&gt; Goodhue explained, that this work compares the economic organization to machine, and introduces a process approach (or systems approach) to economics. Goodhue (1921) explained.
[[File:Diagram of want-gratifying goods, 1921.jpg|thumb|Diagram of want-gratifying goods.]]
[[File:Table of different forms of Wealth in 1912, 1921.jpg|thumb|Different forms of Wealth in 1912.]]
[[File:Diagram of gratifying wants, 1921.jpg|thumb|Diagram of gratifying wants, 1921]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our economic organization is compared to a machine with parts, articulation of parts, motive power, and control or guidance. No one claims that the machine at all times or perhaps at any time works perfectly. There are still many defects. Some parts are not well adapted to their uses; parts rattle, jam and squeak; too much or perchance at times too little motive power is applied; and at times (business depressions) the whole machine seems to break down. Despite the defects, however, the machine functions and is surprisingly well adapted to its purpose of producing goods in quantity, of producing them at right times, and of getting them into the hands of consumers with some accuracy and comparatively little difficulty.&lt;br&gt;The real test of any good machine is that it be designed for its purpose and that it accomplish that purpose at as low a cost as possible under the conditions which prevail at the time. Our economic machine appears to fulfill these conditions. On this point, indeed, many earnest students of economics honestly doubt the truth of the above statement. They see glaring faults of economy and justice, and take decided exception to the proposition that the present economic organization is adapted to its purpose. Possibly in the past, it is said, but certainly not today.&lt;ref name="EWG 1921"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The complete work is illustrated with over 100 illustrations; tables, schemes, pictures, drawings, maps, graphs, block diagrams, tree diagrams, [[classification chart|classification]] and [[organization chart]]s, presenting a mix of empirical and theoretical data. The process approach is recognizable in the visualization of some specific economic phenomena in diagrams, such as the diagram of gratifying wants (see image).

Goodhue (1921) further explained, that the book at the outset rather assumes [[Economic problem#Wants|human wants]] and the goods to gratify those wants. Its interest lies in the field of processes. The aim was to start the student in elementary economics with a study of our want gratifying machine, to show him how this machine has come to be, and how it serves its purpose in apportioning our social resources, viz: [[labor power]], [[Capital (economics)|capital]], acquired knowledge and [[natural resources]] to the production and sale of goods.&lt;ref name="EWG 1921"/&gt;

Although this approach to economics in its time was somewhat new and rather unorthodox, nevertheless there was much to be said in its favor, according to  Goodhue (1921):&lt;ref name="EWG 1921"/&gt;
* It serves at the outset to develop an interest in economics in the mind of the student, a thing much to be desired.
* It introduces the student to something with which he is a bit familiar, instead of very early in the course dropping him down into the midst of an elusive exposition of marginal utility and marginal cost. 
* In describing for the student the existing system of economic organization it better prepares him to grasp the difficulties of terminology and theory on which the organization is based.

There is no attempt to expound principles. All that is left to be taken up at a later point in the course. Those who have taught elementary economics will appreciate the difficulty of interesting and holding the students when they are plunged at the outset into the midst of the complexities of utility, value, and prices. This book goes far to solve that most difficult problem of arousing student interest in the course. It was considered eminently practical, readable, suggestive, and as such merits consideration.&lt;ref name="EWG 1921"/&gt;

==== Topics discussed in the book ====
The topics discussed in the book are in the main those of Professor Marshall's more pretentious work ''Readings in Industrial Society.'' The first two chapters on human wants and social resources aim to show the reasons for any form of economic organization.

Then follow six chapters on English industrial history which, as the authors state, "are not 'historical' in any orthodox sense of the term. They are a somewhat more extended view of the problem at issue." The remainder of the book is taken up with a functionalized description of the economic organization of the United States. There are four chapters on specialization, two on machine industry, three on business organization, three on the province of the enterpriser, two each on money and financial organization and the utilization of natural and human resources, and one on planning, guiding, and controlling.&lt;ref name="EWG 1921"/&gt;

==== Reception ====
A 1921 review of this work by Goodhue,&lt;ref name="EWG 1921"/&gt; states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... it is clear that what should be included, what should be excluded, where the emphasis should be placed is largely a matter of choice, and is somewhat dependent upon the purpose the authors have in mind. Not all topics which quite fall within the scope of the book can be equally well treated, especially if the work is elementary in character. It may be a source of disappointment to certain readers that the authors have done little more than to suggest or imply at some points in their discussion the motive forces of organization. We find comparatively little on gain-seeking, prices, competition, property, contract, and the necessities for interdependence.&lt;ref name="EWG 1921"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And furthermore:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The book does not pretend to cover the entire field of economics. It is designed merely as an introductory text and can well be combined with some one of the standard works on the ''Principles of Economics.'' As a stimulating, attractive, readable book it is a great success. The authors should be complimented on making available this material on economic organization in such a clear and teachable form. The practical questions at the end of each chapter are helpful and suggestive, and add a good deal to the teachable qualities of the book.&lt;ref name="EWG 1921"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Maximo''' is an [[Enterprise Asset Management]] (EAM) software solution originally developed by [[MRO Software|Project Software &amp; Development Inc (PSDI)]] with the first commercial version released {{Years ago|1985|df=y|br=y}} years ago.&lt;ref name="History1"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Maximo began|publisher=DeveloperWorks|last=Chertow|first=Dick|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:wgOYA2hyj-QJ:https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/a9ba1efe-b731-4317-9724-a181d6155e3a/entry/How_Maximo_began+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CWdawn2000"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Computer Weekly]]|title=Dawn of the age of smart assets|last=Gurton|first=Annie|date=November 2000|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Dawn-of-the-age-of-smart-assets|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purchased by [[IBM]] in 2005 it is currently branded as '''IBM Maximo Asset Management'''.

Maximo is designed to assist an organisation in managing its assets such as buildings, vehicles, fire extinguishers, equipment recording details such as details, maintenance schedules and participating in [[workflow|workflows]] to manage the assets.&lt;!-- Trying some form of laymans speak as to what it is about--&gt;   

==History==

Maximo was developed by Project Software &amp; Development Inc (PDSI) which changed its name to MRO Software in 2000.&lt;ref name="BuyTheReg"&gt;{{cite news|title=IBM buys MRO Software - Gives Big Blue more depth|first=Tony|last=Lock|publisher=The Register|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/08/21/ibm_buys_mro/|date=21 August 2006|access-date=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changing PSDI to MRO Software Represents More Than a Name Change|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/318181/changing-psdi-mro-software-represents|date=20 December 2000|access-date=22 April 2018|id=G0094807|website=Gartner|first1=Kristian|last1=Steenstrup|first2=Dan|last2=Miklovic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The product was acquired by IBM and placed in the [[Tivoli Software|Tivoli Portfolio]]&lt;ref name="BuyTheReg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roadmap2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mclansys.com/pdf/maximo-roadmap.pdf|title=The IBM Maximo roadmap: What it means for Enterprise Asset Management|access-date=1 April 2018|date=2006|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401222119/http://www.mclansys.com/pdf/maximo-roadmap.pdf|archive-date=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously the Tivoli portfolio contained software that was related to the Information Technology sphere; this acquisition brought management of non Information Technology assets into the portfolio.&lt;ref name="Pulse2008a"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/news/1315230/IBM-Tivoli-Pulse-Tivoli-product-updates-and-cloud-confusion|date=27 May 2008|first=Michael|last=Coté|title=IBM Tivoli Pulse: Tivoli product updates and cloud confusion|id=Tivoli's acquisition of MRO|access-date=2 April 2018|website=TechTarget}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With release 7.6 the program has been developed with options to be deployed in a [[multitenancy]] solution which has options for deployment to [[Cloud computing|the cloud]] and delivery by [[Software as a service|Software as a Service]] (SaaS) solution . The program has traditionally been based on a character-based user experience known as the ''classic interface''.  Later versions have also provided a graphical interface termed by IBM as a ''Work Center'' based graphical interface.&lt;ref name="MavenCon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mavenasset.com/getting-started-with-maximo-work-centers/|title=Getting Started with Maximo Work Centers|last=Gorinas|first=Christen|date=5 January 2018|website=Maven|access-date=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; . It is available for  a mobile platform as Maximo Anywhere

==Architecture==

Maximo originated as a stand-alone solution running on an [[IBM Personal Computer]].  Currently it is supported on specified versions of [[AIX]], [[Linux]] and [[Windows Server]], previously [[HP-UX]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] were also supported.&lt;ref name="retireM6"&gt;{{cite web|title=End of Support (EOS) Announcement for Maximo 6.0 and 6.1|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?tcss=Newsletter&amp;uid=swg27018831|date=26 May 2010|website=[[IBM]]|dead-url=no|access-date=1 April 2018|archive-date=1 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401044905/http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?tcss=Newsletter&amp;uid=swg27018831|first=William J.|last=Sawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;     Successive versions have developed to leverage newer technologies.  Interfaces have been developed for automated interfacing feeds, integration with enterprise level database, resource and reporting tools. &lt;!-- Section may be moved to Tivoli Software --&gt;

The Tivoli Process Automation Engine  is the key component for building and implementing the workflows.  These are customized to match the business processes.  Core   functionality is increased by add on modules including spatial, scheduler and asset health insights.

Pre-configured solutions customised models for some industry solutions are available including rail, nuclear and mining.  Some of these solutions will require add of components. Adapter solutions are available for interfacing to other software packages and protocols.Implementation .&lt;ref name="Gguide"&gt;{{cite book|title=IBM Maximo Asset Management The Consultant's Guide|isbn=978-8394419226|date=18 April 2016|first=Robert|last=Zientara|edition=1.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Federation of Independent Business''' ('''NFIB''') is the largest small business association in the U.S. It is headquartered in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], with offices in [[Washington, D.C.]], and all 50 [[U.S. state|state]] capitals. NFIB is a non-profit that works to defend the right of small business owners to own and operate their businesses without undue government interference.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/National_Federation_of_Independent_Business&lt;/ref&gt; Its political action committee is called [[Save America's Free Enterprise]] Trust.

==History==
{{advert section|date=July 2017}}
{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}
NFIB was founded by C. Wilson Harder in 1943 and maintained its headquarters in [[San Mateo, California]], until 1992 when it was relocated to Nashville, TN. Harder began with a home office and sold the first memberships to his neighbors. His vision was to give small and independent business a voice in governmental decision-making through political advocacy. Since its early history, NFIB's political agenda has been determined through a one-vote balloting process of its membership.

Harder was succeeded in 1969 by his son John, who was replaced just six months later by Wilson S. Johnson. Under Johnson, member Action Councils were created, which still exist today, known as Leadership Councils. Through this time, NFIB also began to gain greater recognition in Washington, D.C., and in state capitals.

John Sloan became President of NFIB in 1983. He was the first chief executive to be brought in from outside the organization. Sloan installed a business structure with a sales manager, finance and administration directed by the CFO (both in San Mateo), and expanded the organization's presence with a public policy operation in Washington, DC.

In 1983, the organization established the NFIB Member Services Corporation. The Corporation is wholly owned by NFIB. Its purpose is to offer preferred-provider member benefit programs to assist members in reducing operating costs. Programs include worker's compensation insurance, commercial and personal health insurance, credit card processing, operational supplies, and discounts on commonly used business products and services.

In 1992, following the death of John Sloan, Jack Faris assumed the role of President and clearly defined NFIB's role in affecting public policy at the state and federal levels through [[politics|political]] and [[grassroots]] [[activism]], and lobbying with lawmakers in an integrated manner. In 1992, NFIB headquarters were officially relocated to Nashville, TN.

Jack Faris announced his retirement in early 2005. The board formed a search committee and selected Todd A. Stottlemyer as the fifth President of NFIB. Stottlemyer took the reins of NFIB on February 15, 2006, with a goal of improving NFIB's non-partisan reach and technology infrastructure.

In February 2009, Dan Danner became the sixth president of NFIB and served until February 2016. Under Danner's leadership, NFIB proved to be a driving force in opposing major governmental regulations; in 2012 it gained historical recognition as the only business association to challenge President Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as a party to the Supreme Court case ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]]''.

Following Danner's retirement, Juanita Duggan was named President and CEO in February 2016. Duggan has taken the lead in establishing NFIB as the source for definitive information on prospective Supreme Court Justices, with regard to their stance on business issues. Recognizing the enduring impact judges can have on the business environment for independent business.

NFIB has grown from Harder's for-profit [[entrepreneur]]ial vision in 1943 to the non-profit national association of more than 325,000 members it is today.

==Politics==
On its website, the National Federation of Independent Business states that it is a "nonprofit, nonpartisan organization founded in 1943" and "represents the consensus views of its members in Washington and all 50 state capitals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfib.com/about-nfib|title=About NFIB|publisher=www.NFIB.com|year=2012|accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Political action committee|PAC]] is called Save America's Free Enterprise Trust (SAFE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fec-political-committees.findthedata.org/l/14397/National-Federation-of-Independent-Business-Save-Americas-Free-Enterprise-Trust |title=National Federation of Independent Business/ Save Americas Free Enterprise Trust - 2012 FEC PAC - Qualified Committee |publisher=www.findthedata.org |year=2012 |accessdate=2012-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710193237/http://fec-political-committees.findthedata.org/l/14397/National-Federation-of-Independent-Business-Save-Americas-Free-Enterprise-Trust |archivedate=2012-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000160|title=National Fedn of Independent Business|publisher=www.opensecrets.org|year=2012|accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, 25 of its members, all Republican, were elected to the 112th Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfib.com/issues-elections/issues-elections-item?cmsid=55637|title=25 NFIB Members Join the 112th Congress|publisher=www.NFIB.com|year=2012|accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of them, such as [[Rand Paul]], [[Jeff Duncan (politician)|Jeff Duncan]], [[Paul Gosar]] and [[Kristi Noem]], are affiliated with or endorsed by the [[Tea Party movement]].

Also in 2010, the NFIB became the lead plaintiff opposing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] health care reform legislation. The organization joined 26 states in the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the act. The case was picked up by the Supreme Court, which issued its ruling on ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]]'' on June 28, 2012, upholding most provisions of the act. [[Karl Rove|Karl Rove's]] conservative [[Crossroads GPS]] PAC gave NFIB $3.7 million to help fund the court fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Slack|first=Donovan|title=Crossroads GPS gave $3.7 million to plaintiff in health care suit|url=http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/04/crossroads-gps-gave-million-to-plaintiff-in-health-120501.html|accessdate=2013-10-11|newspaper=Politico.com|date=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Meanwhile, many other small business advocates supported PPACA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Pinckney| first =Barbara|url=http://albany.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2010/03/22/daily2.html| title =Business groups split on health care bill| work=The Business Review| date= 2010-03-22| accessdate = 2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFIB supported the [[America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2014 (H.R. 4457; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend section 179 of the [[Internal Revenue Code]], which mostly affects small- to medium-sized businesses, to retroactively and permanently extend from January 1, 2014, increased limitations on the amount of investment that can be immediately deducted from [[taxable income]].&lt;ref name=cbo4457&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4457|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45326|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill would return the tax code to its 2013 status and make the change permanent.&lt;ref name=PomerleauTaxFound&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pomerleau|first1=Kyle|title=Tiberi Bill on permanent Extension of Small Business Expensing|url=http://taxfoundation.org/blog/tiberi-bill-permanent-extension-small-business-expensing|publisher=Tax Foundation|accessdate=12 June 2014|date=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Danner, the president and CEO at that time, argued that Congress could help small business by passing the bill as it would enable small businesses to "plan for the future, invest in the economy and hire new workers."&lt;ref name=CNBC5ways&gt;{{cite news|last1=Danner|first1=Dan|title=5 ways Washington can help small business|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101650387|accessdate=12 June 2014|publisher=CNBC|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IN 2017, NFIB endorsed confirmation of SCOTUS nominee [[Neil Gorsuch]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfib.com/assets/NFIB-Key-Vote-Support-of-U.S.-Supreme-Court-Nomination-Judge-Gorsuch.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Niels Carlsen''' (8 January 1734 &amp;ndash; 3 May 1809) was a Norwegian timber merchant, landowner, shipowner and banker. Carlsen was one of the biggest ship owners in Norway of his time. &lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Niels Carlsen |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Bernhard |last=Magnussen |authorlink= |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Niels_Carlsen/utdypning |language=Norwegian |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Carlsen was born in [[Drøbak]] in [[Akershus]], Norway.  He was the son of Jacob Carlsen (ca. 1685-1749) and Maria Jørgensdatter Frost. His father had married the widow of his employer and took over the trading business. Drøbak had a favorable location situated on east side of [[Drøbak Sound]], at the narrowest part of the [[Oslo Fjord]]. It was near the capital, had good anchoring and mooring facilities and a protective harbor. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    https://snl.no/Dr%C3%B8bak|title=Drøbak|publisher= Store norske leksikon|author=  Svein Askheim|accessdate= July 15,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niels Carlsen and his half brothers Christian went into their father's business and expanded it. The brothers were shipowners, forest owners, traded in both imports and exports and took part in the financing operations that came with the profession. Carlsen bought up forest lands on both sides of the bay, floated the logs into circulation plots which he had acquired along Drøbak Sound, operated a sawmill and built bulwark against the sea to facilitate the loading of ships.  He owned a large part of the property along the seafront as well as the small islands where [[Oscarsborg Fortress]] is now situated. With these acquisition, he initiated the operation of a ferry landing, plus guest house and coaching inn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Niels Carlsen |first= |last= |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor-last=Godal | editor-first=Anne Marit | editor-link=Anne Marit Godal |publisher=Norsk nettleksikon |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/Niels_Carlsen |language=Norwegian|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlsen married Martha Zachariassen (1743–1821), the daughter of Zacharias Simonsen Wesseltoft (1701-1777), a wealthy merchant and shipowner in [[Skien]]. She and her family contributed to the further development of Carlsen's business and to the development of Drøbak. Carlsen and his wife donated funds for a  wooden cruciform church, hospital and school. Drøbak Church (''Drøbak kirke'') was fully furnished and was inaugurated in 1776. Facing the church is the building which was dedicated as a hospital and hostel for poor widows in 1793. A bust of Carlsen, made by [[Arne Vinje Gunnerud]], is located between  Drøbak Church and the old Drøbak Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    http://www.frogn.kirken.no/kirkene/drobak-kirke|title=Drøbak kirke|publisher=  kirken i  Drobak og Frogn|author=  Leif Lund-Berg|date=   17 July 1996|accessdate= July 15,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://verneforeningen.no/international-visitors/history-of-drobak/|title=  History of Drøbak|publisher =  verneforeningen.no |accessdate= July 15,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    http://verneforeningen.no/walks-around-drobak/

A '''Personal Insolvency Arrangement''' (PIA) is  [[Ireland]]'s [[debt management]] solution for individuals who want to avoid outright [[bankruptcy]] and declare [[insolvency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Insolvency Arrangements|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_arrangements.html|publisher=Government of Ireland|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement is one of the three alternatives authorized under Ireland's Personal Insolvency Act 2012; Debt Settlement Arrangements (DSA) and Debt Relief Notices (DRN) make the other two arrangements. PIA mandates a legal agreement between a [[debtor]] and their [[creditors]], which is mediated and administered by a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP). A PIA usually lasts for a term of six years and must include both [[unsecured debt]] and secured [[debts]].

== Eligibility ==
Eligibility criteria for a [[debtor]] include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eligibility criteria for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement.|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0044/sec0091.html|publisher=Irish Statue Book, Office of AG, Government of Ireland|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The debtor is [[insolvent]], that is they cannot pay debts in full when they are due.
* The debtor owes a debt to at least one [[secured creditor]] holding security over [[Ireland|Irish]] property or assets.
* The debtor has secured debts less than €3 million (unless [[creditors]] agree to upper limit)
* The debtor has co-operated with their secured creditor under a [[mortgage]] arrears process for 6 months.
* The debtor must live in the [[Republic of Ireland]], or ordinarily resided or had a place of business within [[Ireland]].
* The debtor provides a Prescribed Financial Statement and a PIP has examined the debtors financial situation and confirms eligibility.
Furthermore, a debtor must not have any agreements mandated under the instant Act, bankrupt nor accumulated 25% or more of their total debt during the previous 6 months

Personal Insolvency Act 2012 envisages that Personal Insolvency Arrangements can only be applied for through an approved third party termed as Personal Insolvency Practitioners. The practitioners are required to be authorised by the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) and include Solicitors [[Barristers]], Qualified [[accountants]], qualified financial [[Financial adviser|advisers]] etc. Till  31 October 2013, it was announced that there are a total of 72 registered Personal Insolvency Practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Register of Personal Insolvency Practitioners|url=http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/PIPs|publisher=Insolvency Service of Ireland|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The type of [[debts]] that can be included in a PIA are split into three types; Included, Excludable and Excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hundreds of new debt arrangements ‘in the pipeline’, Insolvency Service of Ireland says|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/hundreds-of-new-debt-arrangements-in-the-pipeline-insolvency-service-of-ireland-says-1.1569819|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agreement Processes Authorized Under The Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scheme of Personal Insolvency Bill|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/documents/publications/presentation/examplesperinsolv.pdf|publisher=Insolvency Service of Ireland|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==

=== Debtor insolvency declaration ===
Initially, the [[debtor]] is required to approach a PIP to provide a full disclosure of his or her financial situation. After appraisal, the PIP suggests best possible agreement. If recommended, the debtor can proceed with the PIA application and appoint the PIP to act on their behalf. A Prescribed Financial Statement is then prepared for the debtor.  which details key information about a debtor’s [[finances]] and clearly shows their [[insolvent]] status.  It must be fully supported by appropriate financial documentation, such as pay slips, bank statements etc. A [[statutory declaration]] in the presence of witnesses to confirm the Prescribed Financial Statement is true and accurate, plus completes and signs the additional documents needed to accompany the Statement to apply for a Protective Certificate. The full application is sent to the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI).

=== Issuance of Protective Certificate ===
A court is authorized to issue a Protective Certificate to the [[debtor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Protective Certificate?|url=http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/PIA_and_PC|publisher=ISI Official Website|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides  [http://www.simplefs.co.uk/personal-insolvency-arrangements.asp PIP] and the debtor 70 days protection against creditor for preparation of a PIA proposal.

=== Preparation of PIA proposal ===
After issuance of  Protective Certificate, PIP has been mandated to prepare a draft PIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insolvency Process|url=http://www.personal-insolvency-arrangement.ie/|publisher=Personal-Insolvency-Arrangement.ie|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the process, the market value of the secured assets can either be agreed between the debtor, creditor and PIP or services of independent valuer can be solicited.

=== Creditors' meeting and approval of PIA ===
Sequel to debtor’s agreement on the PIA proposal, the PIP is required to call a [[creditor]]s' meeting in which through voting, creditors representing at least 65% of the total [[debts]] – 50% of the unsecured and 50% of the secured – must agree to the proposal. After approval in the vote, the documents are required to be forwarded to ISI, which will notify the [[Circuit Court]]. Thus final approval sits with the court, and any [[creditor]]'s objection will be considered by them.
The law requires that after approval the debtor’s name, address details, birth year and PIA start date o be made available on the [[Insolvency Service of Ireland|ISI website]].

=== Execution of PIA ===
After formal approval by the courts and notification with ISI, [[debtors]] are required to set up payments to the PIP, which in turn distribute the payments to creditors as per agreements. A PIA has a lifespan of six years.

==== Completion ====
If a debtor completes all of their obligations under the PIA, the agreement is considered complete. At completion, PIP through [[creditors]] finalize the treatment of the remaining balances debt; unsecured debt balances will be written off, while secured debt balances are discharged as per the PIA agreement. The PIP coordinates the removal of debtor’s information from the Register of Personal Insolvency Arrangements within three months, making the debtor solvent.

==== Failure ====
A PIA will be deemed to have failed if [[creditors]] do not agree to the PIA or if the debtor fails to maintain his or her duties and obligations.
This can be avoided if a debtor can anticipate a potential problem keeping up with payments, because their PIP may be able to arrange a variation with creditors to ensure a way can be found to continue with the PIA and prevent it from failing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What happens when a PIA fails?|url=http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/WP13000122|publisher=ISI website|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Insolvency agreements in the UK ==
In the UK, a similar arrangement exists under the name of individual voluntary arrangement (IVA). IVA has been mandated under the Insolvency Act 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Options for paying off your debts|url=https://www.gov.uk/options-for-paying-off-your-debts/individual-voluntary-arrangements|publisher=UK Government Government Digital Service|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Theobaldus Curtenius''' (April 3, 1734 in [[New York City]] &amp;ndash; 1798 in New York City) was an American merchant and politician.

==Early life==
Peter Theobaldus Curtenius was born on April 3, 1734 in [[New York City]]. He was the son of Rev. Anthonius Curtenius, a clergyman of the Dutch Church who had come from [[Holland]] to the [[United States]]. 

==Career==
In 1774, he was a member of the New York [[Committee of Correspondence]]. On May 31, 1775, the [[New York Provincial Congress]] appointed him [[Commissary|Commissary General]], with the rank of [[colonel]], being in charge of the purchase of provisions for the [[Continental Army]].

In 1782, after the resignation of [[Comfort Sands]], he was appointed [[New York State Comptroller|New York State Auditor]], holding the post until the creation of the succeeding office of comptroller in 1797.

==Personal life==
In August 1755, he married Catharine Goelet (died 1806), a sister of his partner [[Peter Goelet]], and their children were:
*Elizabeth Curtenius (born 1757)
*Anthony Curtenius (born 1759)
*Catharine Curtenius Dunlap (born 1761)
*Gen. Peter Curtenius (1763–1817)
*Janet Curtenius (born 1765)
*Philip Curtenius (born 1768)
*Jane Curtenius (1770–1846), who married Elbert Roosevelt (1767–1857), grandson of [[Johannes Roosevelt]] (1689–1750)
*Mary Curtenius (born 1773)
*Anthony Washington Curtenius (born 1775).

He died from [[yellow fever]] in New York City, and was originally buried at the vault of the Middle Dutch Church on Cedar Street, but he and his son Peter's remains were re-interred in 1857 at the [[Beechwoods Cemetery (New Rochelle, New York)|Beechwoods Cemetery]] in [[New Rochelle, New York]].

===Descendants===
His son Peter as the Marshal of the City of New York in 1812 carried out a registration of "Alien Enemies", that is British people, of whom there were about 1500 in the city, following the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]]. His grandson, [[Clinton Roosevelt]] (1804–1898), was a politician and inventor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3865">'''Process architecture''' is the structural design of general process systems. It applies to fields such as computers (software, hardware, networks, etc.), business processes ([[enterprise architecture]], policy and procedures, logistics, project management, etc.), and any other process system of varying degrees of [[complexity]].&lt;ref name=parch&gt;Dawis, E. P., J. F. Dawis, Wei-Pin Koo (2001).  Architecture of Computer-based Systems using Dualistic Petri Nets.  Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 2001 IEEE International Conference on Volume 3, 2001 Page(s):1554 - 1558 vol.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Processes are defined as having inputs, outputs and the energy required to transform inputs to outputs.  Use of energy during transformation also implies a passage of time: a process takes [[Real-time computing|real time]] to perform its associated action.  A process also requires space for input/output objects and transforming objects to exist: a process uses real space.

A process system is a specialized [[system]] of processes.  Processes are composed of processes.  Complex processes are made up of several processes that are in turn made up of several processes.  This results in an overall structural [[hierarchy]] of [[abstraction]].  If the process system is studied hierarchically, it is easier to understand and manage; therefore, process architecture requires the ability to consider process systems hierarchically. Graphical modeling of process architectures is considered by [[dualistic Petri nets]]. Mathematical consideration of process architectures may be found in [[Calculus of communicating systems|CCS]] and the [[π-calculus]].

The structure of a process system, or its architecture, can be viewed as a dualistic relationship of its [[infrastructure]] and suprastructure.&lt;ref name=parch/&gt;&lt;ref name=ss7arch&gt;Dawis, E. P. (2001).  Architecture of an SS7 Protocol Stack on a Broadband Switch Platform using Dualistic Petri Nets.  Communications, Computers and signal Processing, 2001. PACRIM. 2001 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Volume 1, 2001 Page(s):323 - 326 vol.1&lt;/ref&gt;  The infrastructure describes a process system's component parts and their interactions.  The suprastructure considers the super system of which the process system is a part.  (Suprastructure should not be confused with [[superstructure]], which is actually part of the infrastructure built for (external) support.)  As one traverses the process architecture from one level of abstraction to the next, infrastructure becomes the basis for suprastructure and vice versa as one looks within a system or without.  

Requirements for a process system are derived at every hierarchical level.&lt;ref name=ss7arch/&gt;  Black-box requirements for a system come from its suprastructure.  Customer requirements are black-box requirements near, if not at, the top of a process architecture's hierarchy.  White-box requirements, such as engineering rules, programming [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]], etc., come from the process system's infrastructure.

Process systems are a dualistic phenomenon of change/no-change or form/transform and as such, are 
well-suited to being modeled by the bipartite [[Petri nets]] modeling system and in particular, process-class [[dualistic Petri nets]] where processes can be simulated in real time and space and studied hierarchically.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3343">'''Rubber Technology''' is the subject dealing with the transformation of [[Natural rubber|rubbers]] or [[elastomer]]s into useful products, such as [[automobile]] [[tire]]s, [[rubber mat]]s and, exercise rubber stretching bands.  The materials includes [[latex]], [[natural rubber]], [[synthetic rubber]] and other polymeric materials, such as [[thermoplastic elastomer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Rubber|url=http://www.industrialrubbergoods.com/types-of-rubber.html|publisher=Industrial Rubber Goods|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubber processed through such methods are components of a wide range of items.

==Vulcanization==
Most rubber products are [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]], a process which involves heating with a small quantity of sulphur (or equivalent [[Cross-link|cross-linking agent]]) so as to stabilise the polymer chains, over a wide range of temperature. This discovery was made by [[Charles Goodyear]] in the 1844, but is a process restricted to polymer chains having a [[Double bond]] in the backbone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Vulcanized Rubber?|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-vulcanized-rubber.htm|publisher=WiseGEEK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such materials include [[natural rubber]] and [[polybutadiene]]. The range of materials available is much wider however, since all polymers become elastomeric above their [[Glass transition]] temperature. However, the elastomeric state is unstable because chains can slip past one another resulting in [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] or [[stress relaxation]] under static or dynamic load conditions. Chemical cross links add the stability to the network that is needed for most practical applications.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Processing of rubber==
[[File:Calender machine.jpg|thumb|right|220px| Milling to soften raw rubber and mix dry ingredients into the compound]]
Methods for processing rubber include [[mastication]] and various operations like mixing, [[calendering]], [[extrusion]], all processes being essential to bring crude rubber into a state suitable for shaping the final product. The former breaks down the polymer chains, and lowers their [[molecular mass]] so that [[viscosity]] is low enough for further processing. After this has been achieved, various additions can be made to the material ready for cross-linking. Rubber may be masticated on a two-roll mill or in an [[industrial mixer]], which come in different [[Industrial Mixer#Types of Mixer|types]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Rubber|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/botany/rubber-info6.htm|publisher=HowStuffWorks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubber is first compounded with additives like sulfur, carbon black and accelerators. It is converted into a dough-like mixture which is called "compound" then milled int'''o''' sheets of desired thickness. Rubber may then be extruded or molded before being cured.

'''''Ruffian''''' is an American [[television film]] that tells the story of the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|U.S. Racing Hall of Fame]] [[Eclipse Award|Champion]] [[Thoroughbred]] [[filly]] [[Ruffian (horse)|Ruffian]] who went undefeated until her [[Animal euthanasia|death]] after breaking down in a nationally televised [[match race]] at [[Belmont Park]] on July 6, 1975 against the [[Kentucky Derby]] winner, [[Foolish Pleasure]].

Made by [[ESPN Original Entertainment]], the film is directed by [[Yves Simoneau]] and stars [[Sam Shepard]] as Ruffian's [[horse trainer|trainer]], [[Frank Y. Whiteley, Jr.|Frank Whiteley]]. The producers used four different [[gelding]]s in the role of Ruffian. Locations for the 2007 film included [[Louisiana Downs]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] and [[Belmont Park]] in [[Elmont, New York]]. 

''Ruffian'' was first broadcast on June 9, 2007 on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network. The [[DVD]] was released on June 12, 2007.

Previously, [[ESPN Classic]] had broadcast a special on July 6, 2000 to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the death of Ruffian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/horse/news/story?id=610063 Ruffian remembered on ESPN Classic]&lt;/ref&gt;

This movie is also one of Laura Bailey's only major live action roles.

'''Savva Ivanovich Mamontov'''  ({{lang-ru|Са́вва Ива́нович Ма́монтов}}, {{IPA-ru|ˈsavə ɪˈvanəvʲɪtɕ ˈmaməntəf|IPA}}; {{OldStyleDate|15 October|1841|3 October|1841}}, [[Yalutorovsk]] – 6 April 1918, [[Moscow]]) was a famous Russian [[industrialist]], [[merchant]], [[entrepreneur]] and [[patron]] of the [[arts]]. 

==Biography==

He was a son of the wealthy [[merchant]] and [[industrialist]] Ivan Feodorovich Mamontov and Maria Tikhonovna (Lakhitina). In 1841, the family moved to [[Moscow]]. From 1852, he studied in [[St. Petersburg]], and later at the [[Moscow University]]. 

In 1864, Savva visited [[Italy]] where he began to take lessons in [[singing]]. There he was introduced to the  daughter of Moscow merchant Grigory Sapozhnikov, 17-year-old Elizabeth, who subsequently became his wife. The wedding took place in 1865 at the Kireevo estate, near [[Khimki]], just northwest of [[Moscow]].

In 1869, he became a [[board of directors|director]] of the [[Moscow]]-[[Yaroslavl]] [[railway]]. It was he who supervised the construction of the [[Severnaya Railway]] linking [[Moscow]] with the [[Russian North]]. He was also involved with the building of the [[Donetsk]] railway from 1876 to 1882. 

In 1870, Mamontov purchased the [[Abramtsevo Colony|Abramtsevo Estate]], located north of [[Moscow]], and founded there an artists' colony which included most of the best Russian [[artist]]s of the beginning of the 20th century, such as [[Konstantin Korovin]], [[Rafail Levitsky]], [[Mikhail Nesterov]], [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Valentin Serov]], [[Mikhail Vrubel]], the brothers [[Vasnetsov]], sculptors [[Viktor Hartmann]] and [[Mark Antokolsky]], as well as various others. The colony of artists who were hosted there during the 1870s and 1880s sought to recapture the quality and spirit of medieval Russian art. Several workshops were set up there to produce handmade furniture, ceramic tiles, and silks imbued with traditional Russian imagery and themes. 

Mamontov also patronised the [[Russian Private Opera]] which discovered the great Russian bass, [[Chaliapin]], and supported the [[Russian opera]] [[composer]]s, [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Alexander Borodin]], [[Modest Musorgsky]], and many others. Drama and opera on Russian folklore themes (e.g., [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s ''[[The Snow Maiden]]'') were produced at Abramtsevo by the likes of [[Konstantin Stanislavsky]], with sets contributed by the brothers [[Vasnetsov]], [[Mikhail Vrubel]], and other distinguished artists. "The Russian Private Opera" was Mamontov's main contribution to the arts. Mamontov acted as a [[stage (theatre)|stage]] [[theatre director|director]], a [[Conducting|conductor]] and a teacher of singing. 

The success of the "Private Opera" in the [[provinces]] was followed by a triumph in [[Moscow]]. However, Mamontov's world came crashing down when, in 1899-1900, Mamontov was unjustly accused of [[embezzlement]] during the building of the [[Yaroslavl]] [[railway]]. He was arrested and put on [[trial]].

But Savva Mamontov was more than a patron of arts and letters, he was a businessman as well, and his contribution to both the national economy and the arts was equally great."  ''(The Russian Cultural Navigator)''

==Popular Culture and Media==
[[Third Eye Blind]]'s song "Monotov's Private Opera" from the album ''[[Ursa Major (album) | Ursa Major]]'' is inspired by Mamontov's private opera.

:''Not to be confused with Statutory power, see [[Statute]].''

{{Use Australian English|date=June 2018}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2018}}
A '''statutory authority''' is a  body set up by [[law]] which is authorised to enact legislation on behalf of the relevant country or state. They are typically found in countries which are governed by a [[Westminster system|British style of parliamentary democracy]] such as the [[UK]] and [[British Commonwealth]] countries like [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[India]]. They are also found in [[Israel]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auditor.leg.state.mn.us/statu.htm Minnesota  Statutory authority - Legislative auditor]&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, many such bodies are termed [[QUANGO]]s because of their semi-autonomous nature{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}.

==Australia==
Federal statutory authorities are typically established under the ''[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/caaca1997387/ Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997]''(Repealed). Statutory authorities at the State or Territory level are established under corresponding State or Territory laws. Each statutory authority tends to have its own enabling legislation, or [[Act of Parliament|originating act]], even if it was established before the relevant over-riding legislation, For example, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) was established in 1949 by the ''Science and Industry Research Act'', but it has since come under the jurisdiction of the ''Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997'' as legislation covering statutory authorities has evolved.

Laws made by statutory authorities are usually referred to as regulations. They are not cited in the same fashion as an act of parliament, but usually with specific initials (depending on the authority) and a number.

Just as Laws enacted by Parliament, all laws made by a statutory authority must be published in the Government Gazette.

===Rationale===

The [[Parliament of Australia]], or a [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|State or Territory Parliament]], will delegate its Authority to a statutory authority for several reasons;

* Efficiency - State and Federal Parliaments do not have the time nor resources to investigate, analyse, draft, enact and monitor laws for every area of our increasingly complex society. By delegation of legislative power to a statutory authority, a specialist body may subrogate parliament and use its authority in a more efficient manner
* Bipartisanship - Statutory authorities are usually responsible for areas of legislation where there is a common goal or direction desirable within the community. Delegation of authority away from parliament prevents these areas of law from becoming partisan issues.
* Transparency - The disclosure requirements placed upon statutory authorities are generally stricter than that of State and Federal Parliaments; statutory authorities cannot rely upon the same government secrets provisions as can State and Federal governments.
* Accountability - The jurisdiction of a statutory authority is expressly set out in its corresponding act (i.e. the Act of Parliament which created the statutory authority). This, therefore, makes switching, sharing or evasion of responsibility in the instance of a scandal more difficult for officers of the statutory authority.

===Statutory Authorities in Australia===

The power to enact legislation has been delegated by Australian Parliaments (State and/or Federal) in the following areas;

* Consumer affairs - Where authority is delegated to the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]]
* Road and traffic safety - Where authority is delegated to various bodies by state, for example, [[VicRoads]] in Victoria
* Public transport - Where authority is delegated to various bodies by state, for example, [[Public Transport Authority (Western Australia)|Public Transport Authority]] in Western Australia.
* Collection of taxes - Where authority is delegated to the [[Australian Taxation Office]]
* Corporate law - Where authority is delegated to the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]]
* Prudential regulation - Where authority is delegated to the [[Australian Prudential Regulation Authority]]
* Monetary Policy - Where authority is delegated to the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] established by an Act of Parliament, the Reserve Bank Act 1959, which gives it specific powers and obligations.
* Workplace Health and Safety - Where authority is delegated to [[Safe Work Australia]] and to various bodies by state, for example, [[WorkSafe Victoria|WorkSafe]] in Victoria and subsidiaries such as the [[Accident Compensation Conciliation Service]]
* Communications and Media - For example, [[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]] is responsible for the regulation of broadcasting, the internet, radiocommunications and telecommunications.
* Offshore petroleum activities - Where authority is delegated to the [[National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority]].

'''''Tell Magazine''''' is a weekly magazine published in [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tellng.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=128&amp;limitstart=1|title=About Us - The Company|work=Tell Magazine|accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[BBC News]] described it as "one of Nigeria's most respected business magazines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6445125.stm|title=Firms struggle in crumbling Nigeria |author= |date=19 March 2007 |work= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
''Tell'' magazine published its first edition on 15 April 1991. All five of the founding editors had worked at ''[[Newswatch (Nigeria)|Newswatch]]'', where they learned to create in-depth, investigative feature stories. They left that magazine due to low pay and disagreements with senior management, hoping that the new magazine would be more fulfilling. Although the magazine's founders had high ambitions, they were not initially hostile to the government. However, they were determined to be free of government or political influence.&lt;ref name=Olukotun2004/&gt;

==Babangida era==
The magazine questioned whether General [[Ibrahim Babangida]] was sincere in saying he would hand over to a civilian government. 
The 2 May 1993 edition with headline "Transition: 21 Traps against handover" was seized, and had to be reprinted in tabloid format. Two more major seizures occurred before Babangida was forced from power in August 1993.&lt;ref name=Olukotun2004/&gt;
In all, 500,000 copies were seized in the last four months of Babangida's rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |publisher=Africa World Press |year=1997|ISBN=0-86543-551-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tell's circulation rose to as many as 100,000 copies each week in the build-up to the June 1993 presidential election and in the subsequent confusion.
Facing harassment from security forces, the magazine began printing underground in July 1993.
On 15 August 1993 police raided the offices and arrested editor-in-chief [[Nosa Igiebor (journalist)|Nosa Igiebor]] and editors Kola Ilori, Onome Osifo-Whiskey and  Ayodele Akinkuoto. holding them for 12 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abacha era==
Conditions became more difficult after General [[Sani Abacha]] took power in November 1993.
On 2 January 1994 armed policemen and security officers seized 50,000 copies of the magazine at the printer's premises. The issue was titled "The Return of Tyranny - Abacha bares his fangs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The editors resorted to guerrilla tactics to survive, forming cells and frequently moving, with the magazine printed covertly in different locations. They relied on help from civilians, who supported the magazine by providing office space, buying copies and helping in many other ways.&lt;ref name=Olukotun2004/&gt;

After the newspaper published a story that revealed that Abacha was suffering from cirrhosis of the liver, police and military raided Igiebor's house while he was away. His wife was maltreated when she said she did not know where he was. A soldier pointed a gun at his four-year-old daughter, threatening to shoot if Igiebor was not produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |publisher=The Futility of the Land Use |year=2002

Igiebor was jailed for six months from late 1995 to 1996, and later fled abroad to escape the threat of assassination.  Osifo-Whiskey also spent six months in detention, arrested after a year in which he avoided his own house and stayed with friends, one of whom was killed.&lt;ref name=Olukotun2004/&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
In 1993, the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] presented Igiebor its [[CPJ International Press Freedom Awards|International Press Freedom Award]], "an annual recognition of courageous journalism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpj.org/awards/ |title=CPJ International Press Freedom Awards 2011 |year=2011 |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his work with the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpj.org/attacks96/frontmatter/ipfa.html |title=Journalists Receive 1996 Press Freedom Awards |year=1996 |publisher=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]] |accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Nosa Igiebor and the staff as a whole were awarded the [[Special Award for Human Rights Journalism Under Threat]] at the [[Amnesty International UK Media Awards]].&lt;ref name="1998 Amnesty Media Awards 001"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news/awards/1998.html |title=Amnesty International UK (AIUK) Media Awards 1998 |accessdate=2017-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010513170831/http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news/awards/1998.html |archivedate=May 13, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The award's notice stated; "Tell has continued to publish throughout the period of Nigerian dictatorship despite intimidation, harassment and the detention without charge or trial of Mr Igiebor and other senior members of the Tell staff."&lt;ref name="1998 Amnesty Media Awards 002"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news/awards/1998.html |title=Amnesty International UK (AIUK) Media Awards 1998 - Winners - Short-list - Judges |accessdate=2017-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DkDDNDx9?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010513170831/http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news/awards/1998.html |archivedate=January 17, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wheat Committee''', an [[United States|American]] study group on the establishment of [[accounting]] principles, was brought into being in 1971 in order to examine the operation of the Accounting Principles Board (APB) and to avoid governmental rule-making. It was headed by [[Francis Wheat]]. The Study Group submitted its recommendations to the AICPA Council in the spring of 1972, which led to the replacement of the APB with the FASB, the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]], in 1973.

The building sporting the American flag on its roof is the Tontine Coffee House. Diagonally opposite (southeast corner, extreme right)&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; is the Merchant's Coffee House, where the [[stockbroker]]s of the [[Buttonwood Agreement]] and others did trade before the construction of the Tontine. On the right is [[Wall Street]], leading down to the [[East River]].]]
The '''Tontine Coffee House''' was a [[New York City]] [[coffee house]] established in early 1793. Situated on the north-west corner of [[Wall Street]] and Water Street,&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nathans133&gt;Nathans, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; it was built by a group of [[stockbroker]]s to serve as a meeting place for trade and correspondence. It was organized as a [[tontine]], a type of investment plan, and funded by the sale of 203 shares of £200 each.&lt;ref name="nyu"&gt;[http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/tontine/bioghist.html Guide to the Records of the Tontine Coffee-House]&lt;/ref&gt; The May 17, 1792, creation of the [[Buttonwood Agreement]], which bound its signatories to trade only with each other, effectively gave rise to a new organization of tradespeople.&lt;ref name=Sobel21&gt;Sobel, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  

In its prime, the Tontine was among New York City's busiest centers for the buying and selling of stocks and other wares, for business dealings and discussion, and for political transaction.&lt;ref name=Antol53&gt;Antol, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Having had a dual function as a combination club and a meeting room,&lt;ref name=Sobel21/&gt; the coffee house played host to auctions, banquets, and balls, among others.&lt;ref name=Sobel21/&gt;&lt;ref name=Antol53/&gt; After hours, gambling and securities dealings were {{nowrap|had – undertakings}} that were then deemed less than honest.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The coffee house also provided a place for the registration of ship cargo and the [[slave trade|trading of slaves]].&lt;ref name=MAAP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maap.columbia.edu/place/16.html|title=Place Detail – Tontine Coffeehouse|publisher=MAAP|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tontine was noted as classless;&lt;ref name=Nathans133 /&gt; individuals from all social strata met there and collectively engaged in the many civil and economic affairs. John Lambert, an English traveller, wrote in 1807:&lt;ref&gt;Still, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;The Tontine Coffee House was filled with underwriters, brokers, merchants, traders, and politicians; selling, purchasing, trafficking, or insuring; some reading, others eagerly inquiring the news […] The steps and balcony of the coffee-house were crowded with people bidding, or listening to the several auctioneers, who had elevated themselves upon a hogshead of sugar, a puncheon of rum, or a bale of cotton; and with Stentorian voices were exclaiming, "Once, twice. Once, twice." "Another cent." "Thank ye gentlemen." [...] The coffee-house slip, and the corners of Wall and Pearl-streets, were jammed up with carts, drays, and wheelbarrows [...] Everything was in motion; all was life, bustle and activity...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Political demonstrations and violence were not uncommon at the Tontine Coffee House.&lt;ref name=Nathans133 /&gt; In the wake of the [[French Revolution]], fistfights between those respectively sympathetic to the British and the French broke out on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;Gilje, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; An anonymous observer wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Gilje, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;Whenever two or three people are gather'd together, it is expected there is a Quarrel and they crowd round, hence other squabbles arise.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On one occasion, French Revolutionists and supporters of the [[Tammany Hall]] movement scaled the coffee house and placed a [[French Liberty Cap]] on the roof.&lt;ref name=Nathans136&gt;Nathans, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Several New York publications mentioned the {{nowrap|event – in}} particular, those newspapers with pro-[[Jacobin Club|Jacobin]] or pro–Democratic-Republican slants applauded the perpetrators and encouraged the Tontine's proprietors to allow the Cap to remain.&lt;ref name=Nathans136 /&gt; In addition, an onlooker named Alexander Anderson describes conflict between [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]]s and [[Tory]]s at the Tontine in a June 11, 1793, diary entry:&lt;ref name=Nathans136 /&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;[L]ast night there was an affray at the Tontine Coffee House between Whig and Tory, or to modernize it, aristocrat and democrat.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In December 1793, New York's ''[[Columbian Gazetteer]]'' complained that "only persons of the same party" would now associate within the Tontine.&lt;ref name=Nathans136/&gt;

Trading at the Tontine Coffee House continued until 1817.&lt;ref name=Antol52&gt;Antol, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of the Tontine's trade proceedings had effected the creation of the [[New York Stock and Exchange Board]] (NYSEB) and necessitated a larger venue.&lt;ref name=Antol52 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fisher59&gt;Fisher, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The NYSEB is recognised as the precursor to the present-day [[New York Stock Exchange]], the largest [[stock exchange]] in the world.&lt;ref name=MAAP /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fisher59 /&gt; The Tontine itself was transformed into a tavern by a John Morse in 1826, and a hotel by [[Lovejoy &amp; Belcher]] in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; It survived the [[Great Fire of New York|Great Fire of 1835]] and was demolished 20 years later.&lt;ref name="nyu" /&gt;

Wall Street is an underground, two-tracked station, with two [[side platform]]s that are slightly offset from one another.

The standard [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company|IRT]] name tablet [[mosaic]]s are original as well as the fancy ceiling accents and the iron pillars. On the southbound platform is a wooden token booth and ticket chopper, wooden restroom doors on each side. The walls on the platforms are clad in pink stone at the bottom, followed by white tiles, the name of the station in white letters and blue mosaics, and decorated tiles at the top. The top part is decorated with tiles depicting vines or artistic depictions of a [[New Amsterdam]] stapled colonial house with the palisade wall in front of it, which gave today's [[Wall Street (Manhattan)|Wall Street]] its name.

The entrances are covered with curved metal roofs painted green. The metal is sculpted with patterns made to resemble wood or leaves.

There is a crossunder about midway along the length of the platforms, and a lesser-used one at the north end.

===Exits===
There are three exit areas. On the south end, between Rector Street and Exchange Place, there are two exits to either side of Broadway, with the northbound exits on the east side and the southbound exits on the west side.&lt;ref name=MTA-LowerManhattan-2014/&gt; There are faux kiosks on the southbound side.

A complex underground passageway exists outside the [[fare control]] which connects to the [[Broad Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Broad Street]] station on the [[BMT Nassau Street Line]], and to the [[Wall Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Wall Street]] station on the Brooklyn Branch of the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]]. This passageway also leads to the Chase Manhattan Plaza and the old [[Equitable Building (Manhattan)|Equitable Building]]. The stations have a shared exit to the eastern corner of Cedar and Nassau Streets.&lt;ref name=MTA-LowerManhattan-2014&gt;{{cite NYCS map|Lower Manhattan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the north end on the southbound side only, there is an exit under the Trinity Building.&lt;ref name=MTA-LowerManhattan-2014/&gt; It has an opulent gold-colored banner proclaiming "SUBWAY ENTRANCE" atop the entrance, which is half a flight below ground. The exit also has a [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] restaurant outside fare control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=TRINITY BUILDING SUBWAY ENTRANCE, Financial District | website=Forgotten New York | date=2015-11-26 | url=http://forgotten-ny.com/2015/11/trinity-building-subway-entrance-financial-district/ | accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Renovation ==
The original white tiles from the early 20th century were walled over with glossy dark blue tiles in the 1970s, with only the name of station allowed to stay. Similar remodeling work was done during that time with [[51st Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|51st Street]] station on the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]], using beige tiles.

In 2006, a project to renovate/restore the station back to its original appearance began. As of May 2006, the blue tiles mentioned above had been removed and remnants of the original white tile-work exposed. The condition of the original tiles were fair to poor to completely missing. All missing tiles were refitted based on original models.
