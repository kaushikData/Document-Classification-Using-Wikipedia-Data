== History ==
In the first decade of their existence Athletic selected English players for the team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inbedwithmaradona.com/retro/2012/7/4/the-history-of-athletic-bilbao-1898-1936.html|last=Radnedge|first=Keir|title=The history of Athletic Bilbao 1898–1936|magazine=[[World Soccer (magazine)|World Soccer]] (via ''In Bed With Maradona'' website)|date=1 August 1977|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cien/&gt;&lt;ref name=origin/&gt; but since 1912&lt;ref name=Voluntad&gt;{{cite web|url=http://servicios.elcorreo.com/especiales/eleccionesathletic/noticias/not270501a.html|title=Voluntad de tradición|trans-title=Will of tradition|language=Spanish|newspaper=El Correo|date=27 May 2001|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have adhered to a policy of allowing only players born in the Basque Country or who learned their football skills at a Basque club to play for them.&lt;ref name=bbcporque/&gt;&lt;ref name=sk /&gt;&lt;ref name=moyes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/sport/primera-liga/for-david-moyes-in-basque-derby-identity-and-sovreignty-and-points-all-part-of-the-pressure |title=For David Moyes in Basque derby, identity and sovereignty and points all part of the pressure |newspaper=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |date=25 September 2015 |accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=origin/&gt; The motto used to describe the reasoning behind it is "Con cantera y afición, no hace falta importación" (English: "with home-grown talent and local support, you don't need foreigners").&lt;ref name=copa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://copa90.com/this-is-football/17208 |title=This Is Athletic Club de Bilbao |publisher=Copa90.com |date=2016-01-11 |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy is not written into the Athletic Bilbao rulebook&lt;ref name=bbcporque/&gt; but has become a philosophy of the club in order to promote local players under the ''[[cantera]]'' (homegrown) system.&lt;ref name=bbcporque/&gt;&lt;ref name=metro /&gt;&lt;ref name=copa /&gt; The policy also extends to Athletic's [[Athletic Bilbao B|reserves]], their [[farm team]] [[CD Basconia]], their [[Athletic Bilbao cantera|youth teams]] and their [[Athletic Club Femenino|women's football department]].&lt;ref name=guard&gt;{{cite web|author=Neil Stacey |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/copa90/2016/jan/15/athletic-club-bilbao-loyalty-spain-liga-basque |title=This is Athletic Bilbao: the club whose loyalty to local talent is not negotiable |work=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not apply to the coaching staff, with managers from England, Hungary, Germany, France and Argentina among those to have led the team at various times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.eus/en/coaches.html |title=Coaches |publisher=Athletic Bilbao |date=|accessdate=13 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were not the only club to adhere to this approach; fellow Basque club [[Real Sociedad]] had a similar policy from the late 1960s&lt;ref name=bbcporque/&gt;&lt;ref name=myth/&gt;&lt;ref name=special&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/3312276/athletic-bilbao-real-sociedad-ready-to-renew-a-special-basque-derby-rivalry|title=Athletic Bilbao, Real Sociedad ready to renew a special Basque derby rivalry|last=[[Sid Lowe|Lowe]]|first=Sid|publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=15 December 2017 |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won two consecutive league titles in the early 1980s adhering to the self-imposed restriction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.football-espana.net/clubs/Real%20Sociedad/history |title=Real Sociedad History|publisher=Football España |date=1 August 2017|accessdate=13 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (as did Athletic),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.football-espana.net/clubs/Athletic%20Bilbao/history |title=Athletic Bilbao History |publisher=Football España |date=1 August 2017|accessdate=13 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  but it was dropped for foreign imports in 1989 when they signed the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] forward [[John Aldridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/2345987/when-john-aldridge-returned-to-real-sociedad-he-got-a-heros-welcome-writes-sid-lowe |title=When John Aldridge returned to Real Sociedad, he got a hero's welcome writes Sid Lowe |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=2015-03-13 |accessdate=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carpet&gt;{{cite web|url= https://as.com/m/diarioas/2015/03/09/english/1425923329_131050.html |title= Real Sociedad roll out the red carpet for John Aldridge |publisher=[[Diario AS]]|date=9 March 2015 |accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moyes/&gt; and for non-Basque Spanish players in 2002 with the transfer of [[Sergio Boris González|Boris]] from [[Real Oviedo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-06-08-2002/Deportes/boris-acabara-con-30-a%C3%B1os-de-tradicion-en-la-real_119558.html|title=Boris acabará con 30 años de tradición en la Real|trans-title=Boris to end 30-year tradition at Real|language=Spanish|newspaper=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|date=6 August 2002|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/2002/08/13/liga/1029227781.html|title=Boris, primer español no vasco en la Real |trans-title=Boris, first non-Basque Spaniard at Real |language=Spanish|newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|date=13 August 2002|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[San Sebastián]]-based club still places a high importance on producing their own local players, and a high percentage of their squad in the 2010s were [[Real Sociedad cantera|home-grown]].&lt;ref name=special/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/revealed-which-clubs-produce-most-europes-top-players |title=Revealed!

Back in 1911, a dispute occurred between Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao regarding the latter fielding ineligible English players in the [[1911 Copa del Rey]];&lt;ref name=cien/&gt; they had also employed the services of several (non-Basque) players from [[Atlético Madrid]] which was then a branch of the Bilbao club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://memoriasdelfutbolvasco.wordpress.com/2014/03/30/manuel-garnica/ | title = Manuel Garnica, the "Saint" who scored a goal with Athletic | trans-title =Manuel Garnica, el “Santo” que metió un gol con el Athletic |language=es|website = Memorias del Fútbol Vasco (Memories of Basque Football) | date= 30 March 2014 |accessdate = 15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.abc.es/20120508/deportes-futbol/abci-historia-athletic-atletico-201205071903.html  | title = Athletic-Atlético, historia de dos parientes| trans-title= Athletic-Atlético, history of two relatives| language=es |newspaper = [[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] | date=8 May 2012|accessdate = 10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] introducing a rule for the next year's competition that all players must be Spanish citizens.&lt;ref name=origin&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vavel.com/es/futbol/2017/03/11/real-sociedad/764769-athletic-el-origen-de-la-filosofia.html|title=Athletic Club: el origen de la filosofía|trans-title=Athletic Club: origin of the philosophy| language=Spanish |publisher=[[Vavel]]| date=11 March 2017|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a large proportion of the players in that early era were Basque,&lt;ref name=special/&gt; relying on locals was no impediment to Athletic and they chose to maintain that approach even when the regulations were relaxed some years later.

The policy has been praised as a symbol of localised football being successful at the highest level,&lt;ref name=bbcporque/&gt;&lt;ref name=methods&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11096/10880323/athletic-bilbaos-methods-provide-lessons-for-premier-league-clubs|title=Athletic Bilbao's methods provide lessons for Premier League clubs|publisher=Sky Sports|date=18 May 2017|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as preserving a strong regional identity&lt;ref name=stronghold/&gt;&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite web|author=Fox Sports |url=http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/athletic-bilbao-club-all-basque-policy-spain-manchester-united-contrast-030812-2-030812 |title=Quaint anachronism of Athletic Bilbao's Basque nationalism |publisher=FOX Sports |date=2012-03-08 |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and being a way for Basque nationalism to be moderately expressed.&lt;ref name=stronghold/&gt;&lt;ref name=goss&gt;{{cite book | first =Brian | last =Goss  | title =Identity: Beyond Tradition and McWorld Neoliberalism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BTdQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=1443869074&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXrfS_8pvPAhWkLsAKHWUIDsIQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=1443869074&amp;f=false |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |location= | volume =   | year = 2014 | isbn = 1443869074 | page =98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fox /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/athletic-bilbao-is-basques-only-and-its-working|title=Athletic Bilbao is 'Basques only' and it's working |publisher=Vice |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=special/&gt; It has been described as discriminatory for only allowing Basque players to play for Athletic Bilbao,&lt;ref name=bbcporque/&gt;&lt;ref name=abre/&gt;&lt;ref name=sk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportskeeda.com/slideshow/football-5-clubs-their-unique-traditions |title=5 football clubs and their unique traditions – Slide 1 of 5 |publisher=Sportskeeda.com |date=2016-01-24 |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it has been suggested that the policy is working for them since Athletic are one of only three clubs (along with [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]) never to have been relegated from La Liga.&lt;ref name=stronghold/&gt;&lt;ref name=copa /&gt;&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;

As of 2018, Athletic's academy teams include a small number of players of an ethnic minority (mostly [[Afro-Spaniard]]) background, including Cameroon-born goalkeeper [[Chris Atangana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://as.com/futbol/2017/11/14/primera/1510687840_265078.html |title=Atangana surge entre los sucesores de Arrizabalaga |trans-title=Atangana emerges among the successors of Arrizabalaga |language=Spanish|publisher=Diario AS |date=14 November 2017 |accessdate=3 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; forward Nico Williams (the younger brother of Iñaki),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bizkaia.eldesmarque.com/athletic-club/noticias/63256-nico-sigue-la-estela-de-inaki-williams |title=Nico sigue la estela de Iñaki Williams |trans-title=Nico follows in the wake of Iñaki Williams |language=Spanish|publisher=El Desmarque  |date=12 October 2017 |accessdate=3 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and defender Loic Boum, also of [[Cameroon]]ian origin, who having been orphaned as a child was a ward of the [[Government of Navarre]] when he moved to the club in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://athletic.elcorreo.com/noticias/201406/04/lezama-pide-permiso-gobierno-20140604171608.html|title=El Athletic, a por un infantil camerunés de Osasuna |trans-title=Athletic, in for a Cameroonian child from Osasuna |language=Spanish|publisher=El Correo |date=5 June 2014 |accessdate=3 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lacanteradelezama.com/loic-boum-es-ya-nuevo-jugador-del-athletic/ |title=Loic Boum es ya nuevo jugador del Athletic |trans-title=Loic Boum is now a new Athletic player |language=Spanish|publisher=La Cantera de Lezama |date=4 August 2014 |accessdate=3 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French players===
The club also rarely fielded players from the French [[Northern Basque Country]], with [[Bixente Lizarazu]] being the first French Basque to play for the club in 1996&lt;ref name=cien/&gt;&lt;ref name=myth/&gt;&lt;ref name=Voluntad/&gt; and [[Aymeric Laporte]] the first to successfully graduate from the [[youth system]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2014/dec/08/french-basque-country-rugby-heartland-deschamps-lizarazu |title=The French Basque Country: a rugby heartland with world-class footballers |work=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moyes/&gt;

Laporte's signing in 2009 prompted debate regarding the definitions of the policy, as he had no link to the Basque region through birth or residency, and a blood link only via [[Grandparent#Great-grandparents|great-grandparents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bizkaia.eldesmarque.com/athletic-club/noticias/36668-laporte-tengo-sangre-vasca-por-parte-de-mis-bisabuelos |title=Laporte: "Tengo sangre vasca por parte de mis bisabuelos" |trans-title=Laporte: "I have Basque blood through my great-grandparents" |publisher=El Desmarque |language=Spanish|date=25 July 2013 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=among&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onlyfootball.fr/?p=513 |title=Aymeric Laporte, un Basque parmi les Basques |trans-title=Aymeric Laporte, a Basque among the Basques |publisher=Only Football |language=French|date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=butterflies&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sofoot.com/aymeric-laporte-a-arrete-de-regarder-les-papillons-173450.html |title=Aymeric Laporte a "arrêté de regarder les papillons" |trans-title=Aymeric Laporte "stopped watching the butterflies” |publisher=So Foot |language=French |date=26 September 2013|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moyes/&gt; He did join a team in the territory, [[Aviron Bayonnais FC|Aviron Bayonnais]],&lt;ref name=ownbio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aymericlaporte.com/en/bio/|title=Biography - Athletic Bilbao signing and beginnings|trans-title=|work=Aymeric Laporte official website |date=|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=butterflies/&gt; but only by arrangement after the initial approach from Athletic, as he was too young to move to a club outside France at the time – he arrived formally in 2010.&lt;ref name=methods/&gt;

====Griezmann debate====
[[Antoine Griezmann]], the French forward developed by Real Sociedad, was the subject of debate regarding his eligibility for a theoretical move to Athletic as he emerged as an elite player in 2012.&lt;ref name=impossible/&gt; Hailing from [[Bourgogne-Franche-Comté|Burgundy]], he arrived at the San Sebastián club aged 14&lt;ref name=antoine&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/griezmann-not-interested-bilbao-speculation|title=Griezmann not interested in Bilbao speculation|publisher=FourFourTwo|date=5 September 2013|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only to play football for their academy teams rather than for some other non-sporting reason, and has no connection to the French Basque Country other than attending school there after signing for Real.

The opinions of some (including Athletic's academy director [[José María Amorrortu]]) &lt;ref name=impossible&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/spanish-football/2017/01/19/5880a91522601d4a498b4577.html |title=Athletic Club's impossible dream of signing Griezmann |newspaper=Marca|date=19 January 2017|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; were that his training at a Basque club from a young age adhered to the policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eitb.eus/es/deportes/futbol/athletic/detalle/900544/el-athletic-interesado-antoine-griezmann--real-sociedad/|title=¿Puede fichar el Athletic a Griezmann?|trans-title=Can Athletic sign Griezmann?|language=Spanish|publisher=EITB|date=6 June 2012|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others insisted that he had the same (ineligible) status as any adult player transferred in by Real and the other local professional clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/es/news/4194/editoriales/2012/09/28/3407931/antoine-griezmann-no-entra-en-la-filosof%C3%ADa-del-athletic-de|title=Antoine Griezmann no entra en la filosofía del Athletic de Bilbao|trans-title=Antoine Griezmann does not enter the philosophy of Athletic Bilbao|language=Spanish|publisher=Goal|date=28 September 2012|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any event, Griezmann showed little interest in joining Athletic,&lt;ref name=antoine/&gt; subsequently moved on to [[Atlético Madrid]]&lt;ref name=impossible/&gt; and was voted the [[2016 Ballon d'Or|world's third best player]] in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/12/cristiano-ronaldo-ballon-dor-fourth-lionel-messi|title=Cristiano Ronaldo wins Ballon d’Or for the fourth time|date=12 December 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; making any move to Bilbao unlikely in the medium term. In respect of any future players of a similar trajectory, Athletic's position on recruitment remains unconfirmed.

===Players of Basque descent===
[[File:Fernando Amorebieta.png|thumb|right|120px|[[Fernando Amorebieta]], born in Venezuela but raised in the Basque Country]]
In 1980 the club was believed to have given serious consideration to signing [[Iker Zubizarreta]], a young [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]] of Basque heritage (his grandfather [[Félix Zubizarreta|Félix]] had starred for Athletic in the 1910s) who had impressed at the [[Football at the 1980 Summer Olympics|football tournament]] at the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], but decided not to pursue it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.naiz.eus/en/hemeroteca/gara/editions/2015-08-06/hemeroteca_articles/iker-zubizarreta-el-nieto-de-leon-que-pudo-ser-cachorro|title=Iker Zubizarreta: el nieto de león que pudo ser cachorro |trans-title=Iker Zubizarreta: grandson of a lion who could have been a puppy|language=Spanish|publisher=[[Gara]]|date=6 August 2015|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, media sources claimed that Athletic had shown interest in young [[Mexican people|Mexican]] midfielder [[Jonathan Espericueta]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|publisher=[[Diario AS]] |date=26 June 2011 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no such move materialised, and the player himself (who did later play in Spain with [[Villarreal CF B|Villarreal B]]) stated that his Basque connection was as distant as a great-great-grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elnuevoheraldo.com/deportes/le-dice-no-a-europa/article_2016b80d-0ccd-5b95-864d-f60cca06d84c.html |title=Le dice 'no' a Europa |trans-title=He says "no" to Europe |language=Spanish |publisher=[[El Nuevo Heraldo]] |date=23 June 2011 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguayan international]] [[Diego Forlán]], whose paternal grandmother was Basque, claimed he had talks over a potential transfer to the club in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forlán afirma que negoció su fichaje por el Athletic|trans-title=Forlán confirms that he negotiated a transfer to Athletic|url=http://athletic.elcorreo.com/noticias/2010-09-14/forlan-hubo-contactos-athletic-201009141353.html|accessdate=18 March 2017|work=[[El Correo]] |date=14 September 2010|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this signing would have been incompatible with the club's current policy as Forlan was not born in a Basque region, nor did he play football as a youth (or at any point in his career) at a club in the territory.

In the years prior to the [[Spanish Civil War]], Athletic undertook a project named 'Operation Return', seeking players born in the Basque region who had emigrated to other countries. One of the few who actually made a competitive appearance for the club was [[:es:Nemesio Tamayo|Nemesio Tamayo]] who had begun his career in his adopted homeland of Chile and also played in Mexico before a brief spell in his birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://jonrivas7.wixsite.com/athletic/single-post/2016/1/17/Tamayo-el-primero-de-la-Operaci%C3%B3n-Retorno |title=La Operación Retorno de 1934  |trans-title=The Operation Return of 1934 |work=El Mundo |language=es |via=Historia Rojiblancas |date=17 January 2016 |accessdate=23 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of Bilbao-born [[Emilio Aldecoa]] in 1947 was unusual as he had spent the past decade of his life in England, having been evacuated as a teenage refugee of the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Spanish refugee boy 78 years ago blazed the trail for David Silva and Cesc Fabregas |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/a-spanish-refugee-boy-78-years-ago-blazed-the-trail-for-david-silva-and-cesc-fabregas-10488958.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=6 September 2015|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First foreign footballers: Spain’s Emilio Aldecoa|url=https://www.football365.com/news/first-foreign-footballers-spains-emilio-aldecoa |website=Football365|date=16 March 2018|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Into the ether: When football welcomed refugees|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/blogs/ether/when-football-welcomed-refugees |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |date=26 April 2017|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another member of that refugee group was the club's star goalkeeper of the era [[Raimundo Pérez Lezama]], although he had returned home much sooner on the outbreak of [[World War II]]; a third Basque refugee [[Sabino Barinaga]] turned down an offer from Athletic and joined [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El momento histórico|trans-title=The historic moment|url=http://algomasquefutbol.blogspot.pt/2007/02/el-momento-histrico.html||website=Algo Más que Fútbol|date=6 February 2007|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Players from Biscay===
It was once the case that Athletic would usually recruit from the [[Biscay]] province surrounding [[Bilbao]]&lt;ref name=myth/&gt; while the other leading clubs Real Sociedad and [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]] would focus on players from their respective provinces [[Gipuzkoa]] and [[Navarre]]. In recent decades (with the pool of potential players declining due to a low birth rate in the area),&lt;ref name=lehendakari/&gt; Athletic expanded their recruitment in these other areas in their efforts to accommodate the best players with any Basque links. This saw many talented players from [[San Sebastián]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://real-sociedad.diariovasco.com/noticias/201610/13/hasta-trece-transfugas-defendido-20161013005246-v.html|title=Real Sociedad: Hasta trece tránsfugas han defendido las dos camisetas|trans-title=Up to thirteen 'traitors' have defended the two shirts|newspaper=[[El Diario Vasco]]|language=Spanish|date=13 October 2016|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pamplona]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://real-sociedad.diariovasco.com/noticias/2011-02-10/chantrea-mejor-vivero-athletic-20110210.html |title=La Chantrea, el mejor vivero, es del Athletic |trans-title=Chantrea, Athletic's best nursery |language=Spanish |publisher=[[El Diario Vasco]]|date= 10 February 2011 |accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; join the club, and also caused Real Sociedad to abandon their own Basque policy in the face of the competition for signings.&lt;ref name=morboreview&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/mar/26/newsstory.sport13|title=Morbo: The Story of Spanish Football by Phil Ball (London: WSC Books, 2001)|date=26 March 2001|accessdate=15 November 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=[[Sid Lowe|Lowe]]|first=Sid}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moyes/&gt;

That change of focus also led to fewer players from the home province being selected; in a 2011 fixture, none of the Athletic starters or substitutes were from Biscay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.footballwhispers.com/blog/athletic-bilbaos-transfer-policy| title = Football Whispers – Athletic Bilbao’s transfer policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.athletic-club.eus/en/match-statistics/1_4456/2010-11_real-zaragoza_athletic-club.html| title = Real Zaragoza 2 Athletic Club 1 02/03/2011|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in subsequent years more local players made the grade, and the situation appears unlikely to occur again in the near future – twelve of the 25 players in the [[2016–17 Athletic Bilbao season#Squad|2016–17 squad]] were born in Biscay, and in November 2017 a study showed that 77% of players in the academy teams hailed from the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bizkaia.eldesmarque.com/athletic-club/noticias/64416-el-77-de-canteranos-del-athletic-son-vizcainos|title=El 77% de canteranos del Athletic son vizcaínos|trans-title=77% of Athletic homegrown players are from Biscay|language=Spanish|newspaper=El Desmarque|date=27 November 2017|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Players from outside the region===
On the other hand, the definitions of the philosophy are stretched occasionally to accommodate promising youngsters with little Basque connection, which does not always sit well with some of the club's followers.

[[Enric Saborit]], originally from [[Catalonia]], who graduated through the youth and reserve levels to reach the first team, caused questions to be asked when he signed in 2008; he had no connection with the region by birth or blood, but while already 16 years old and playing in [[RCD Espanyol]]'s ''cantera'' teams, he moved to [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] where his mother had relocated for work two years earlier. As soon as he became a resident of the territory, Saborit was deemed eligible by Athletic to play for the club.&lt;ref name=debate&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archivo.marca.com/edicion/marca/futbol/1a_division/athletic/es/desarrollo/1094438.html |title=Saborit abre el debate de la filosofía del club |trans-title=Saborit opens debate on club philosophy |publisher=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|language=Spanish|date=27 February 2008 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abre/&gt;&lt;ref name=catalan&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/deportes/futbol/20170104/413083135665/saborit-catalan-athletic.html |title=Saborit, un catalán en el Athletic |trans-title=Saborit, a Catalan at Athletic|publisher=[[La Vanguardia]]|language=Spanish|date=5 January 2017 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2017, Athletic recruited Youssouf Diarra, an 18-year-old forward born in Mali who was raised in Catalonia and had spent the past two years playing for clubs in Navarre after moving these to continue his education, which the club deemed sufficient under the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacanteradelezama.com/youssouf-diarra-se-incorporara-al-basconia/|title=Youssouf Diarra se incorporará al Basconia

However, despite having invited Ochoa (the spelling of whose name was changed to the Basque ''Otxoa'' in club records) to join,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.eus/en/players/2549/otxoa.html|title=Deiby Otxoa profile|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in October 2017 it was announced that Athletic's youth training camp in [[Oyón-Oion|Oion]] – a village in [[Álava]], but just a few miles from [[Logroño]] – would no longer accept players who did not fit the Athletic philosophy, effectively excluding around 150 Riojan youngsters of various ages from the system and leaving only around ten Basques across the squads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/deportes/futbol/20171021/432229155688/athletic-oyon-la-rioja.html|title=El Athletic expulsa a 150 canteranos por su procedencia riojana|trans-title=Athletic expels 150 canteranos for their Riojan origin|language=Spanish|newspaper=La Vanguardia|date=21 October 2017|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://athletic.elcorreo.com/athletic-expulsa-cantera-20171021223007-nt.html|title=El Athletic no admitirá a niños riojanos en su escuela alavesa de Oion|trans-title=Athletic will not admit children from La Rioja in their Alavese school at Oion|language=Spanish|newspaper=El Correo|date=21 October 2017|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oyon/&gt; Past recruits born in that region, who were considered eligible due to their formative club being Osasuna or Real Sociedad, include [[José Mari García]], [[Santiago Ezquerro]], [[David López (footballer, born 1982)|David López]] and [[Borja Viguera]]; however, the justifications for allowing [[Luis de la Fuente Castillo|Luis de la Fuente]] and later [[Daniel Aranzubia]] to join Athletic's youth system directly from Riojan clubs were less clear.&lt;ref name=oyon&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.larioja.com/deportes/futbol/llorente-haber-oyon-20171020002918-ntvo.html|title=Llorente sí podría haber ido a Oyón

In January 2018, Athletic announced a new signing who was more obviously non-Basque by ethnicity: 25-year-old [[Cristian Ganea]], a [[Romania national football team|Romanian international]]&lt;ref name="Athletic_Bilbao_transfer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athletic-club.eus/en/news/18649/cristian-ganea-initial-agreement-with-fc-viitorul.html|title=Cristian Ganea: Initial agreement with FC Viitorul|publisher=Athletic Bilbao|date=15 January 2018|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was also born in that country and had only played for Romanian clubs for the past five years. But prior to that, he had spent his teenage years living in [[Basauri]] just outside Bilbao and had featured for local teams (including [[CD Basconia|Basconia]], Athletic's farm team at semi-professional level who have a separate amateur and juvenile structure), meaning he too was eligible under the 'learned skills at a Basque club' aspect of the policy.&lt;ref name=abcficha&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.es/deportes/futbol/abci-athletic-ficha-ganea-primer-rumano-historia-201801151632_noticia.html|title=El Athletic ficha a Cristian Ganea, el primer rumano de su historia|trans-title=Athletic sign Cristian Ganea, the first Romanian in their history|newspaper=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|date=15 January 2018|accessdate=16 January 2018|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mundoficha&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/deportes/futbol/2018/01/15/5a5cac83ca47419e778b4645.html|title=El Athletic ficha al internacional rumano Cristian Ganea|trans-title=Athletic sign the Romanian international Cristian Ganea|newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|date=15 January 2018|accessdate=16 January 2018|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Border Patrol Police''' ({{lang-th|ตำรวจตระเวนชายแดน)}}; (BPP) is a [[Thailand|Thai]] [[paramilitary]] under the jurisdiction of the [[Royal Thai Police]], responsible for [[Border guard|border security]] and [[counter-insurgency]].

==History==
The Thai Border Patrol Police was organized in the 1951 with assistance from the [[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. Although technically part of the [[Royal Thai Police]] (RTP), the BPP has always enjoyed a great deal of autonomy within the national headquarters as well as in its field operations. The royal family was a principal patron of the organization. This traditional relationship benefited both the palace and its paramilitary protectors. Many BPP commanders were former army officers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-13813.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

===National Organization===
*Headquarters Border Patrol Police Bureau
**General Staff Division
*Special Training Division
*Support Division
*[[Border Patrol Police#Border Patrol Police Aerial Reinforcement Unit|Police Aerial Reinforcement Unit]] (PARU)
**[[Naresuan 261 Counter-Terrorism Unit]]
*Village Scout Center
*BPP Regional Divisions 1, 2, 3, and 4.

===Field organization===
Platoons of 32-men form the basic operating units of the BPP. Each platoon is supported by one or more heavy weapons platoons stationed at the regional and area RTP headquarters. PARU can airlift BPP platoons to troubled areas when an emergency arises. Armed with modern light infantry equipment, the BPP also benefited from training by [[United States Army Special Forces]] advisers who helped establish an instruction program during the 1960s.

The BPP served as an important adjunct to the Thai military and often operated under army (and sometimes the [[Royal Thai Marine Corps]]) control during counterinsurgency operations.

BPP units stationed along the Cambodian and Laotian borders following the [[Cambodia–Vietnam relations#Cambodian-Vietnamese War|Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1979]] often served as a first line of defense and bore the brunt of [[Vietnamese border raids in Thailand|Vietnamese attacks]].

In order to carry out its intelligence mission, the BPP operates numerous [[civic action program]]s to cultivate and maintain rapport with remote area villagers and hill tribes. They have built and operate schools in remote areas and help the army construct offices for civilian administration. They  operate rural medical aid stations, give farmers agricultural assistance, and have built small airstrips.

===Border Patrol Police Aerial Reinforcement Unit===
The Border Patrol Police Parachute Aerial Resupply Unit (BPP PARU or PARU) is the BPP's [[special forces]] unit responsible for training and supporting airborne operations, airborne reinforcement, disaster and accident rescue, and supporting special missions under the command of the BPP. All members of PARU are trained for airborne operations, including free-fall jumps. PARU can provide support to BPP headquarters within two hours. The PARU in the 1950s and 1960s was a small unit used for clandestine missions outside Thailand. It was largely [[CIA]]-funded at that time.&lt;ref name="Rattanasengchanh-2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rattanasengchanh|first1=Phimmasone Michael|title=Thailand's Second Triumvirate: Sarit Thanarat and the military, King Bhumibol Adulyadej and the monarchy and the United States. 1957-1963| date=2012|publisher=University of Washington|location=Seattle|url=https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/21997/Rattanasengchanh_washington_0250O_10615.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=26 April 2017|format=MA Thesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|51}} PARU's counts its founding from 27 April 1954, when King Bhumibol visited the opening ceremony of the PARU Company's [[Naresuan Camp]] in [[Hua Hin]].&lt;ref name="Hyun-2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hyun |first1=Sinae |title=Indigenizing the Cold War: Nation - Building by the Border Patrol Police of Thailand, 1945 - 1980 |date=2014 |publisher=University of Wisconsin |location=Madison |url=https://depot.library.wisc.edu/repository/fedora/1711.dl:JKW6YYIA5ESL28Y/datastreams/REF/content |accessdate=15 August 2018 |format=Dissertation}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|92}}

* unconventional warfare, counter-terrorism, and parachute training of the Royal Thai Police.
* disaster and accident rescue on land and water including [[air-sea rescue]].

==Subordinate paramilitary forces==
===Volunteer Defense Corps===
{{main|Volunteer Defense Corps (Thailand)}}
{{refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
The BPP organized the paramilitary Volunteer Defense Corps or VDC (the ''Or Sor'') in 1954 to provide law and order and emergency response. This was done in response to complaints of banditry and harassment by subversive organizations. The VDC had the responsibility of protecting inhabitants from threats and intimidation by guerrillas who had infiltrated the border provinces from neighboring Laos, Cambodia, and Malaysia. Its mission is to deny insurgents access to food and other supplies that made villages and farms their targets. VDC members were trained by the BPP. In 1974 it was expanded by the [[Internal Security Operations Command]] (ISOC)  to urban areas to fight left-wing political activism. In the late 1980s, VDC strength was estimated at roughly 33,000, down from a peak of about 52,000 in 1980. Part of the reduction was absorbed by the formation of the Thahan Phran, a paramilitary unit formed to counter communist insurgents. They were reinvigorated and have played a role in the fighting the [[South Thailand insurgency]] since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Southern Thailand: The Problem with Paramilitaries |journal=Asia Report |number=140 |date=23 October 2007 |publisher=International Crisis Group |pages=14–15 |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/asia/south-east-asia/thailand/140_southern_thailand___the_problem_with_paramilitaries.ashx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208035841/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/asia/south-east-asia/thailand/140_southern_thailand___the_problem_with_paramilitaries.ashx |archivedate=8 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Village Scouts===
{{main|Village Scouts}}
The BPP, together with the [[Ministry of Interior (Thailand)|Ministry of Interior]], backed and sponsored the 1971 establishment of the "[[Village Scouts]]", a right-wing rural vigilante group and paramilitary militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Benedict |last=Anderson |title=The Spectre of Comparisons: Nationalism, Southeast Asia, and the World |publisher=Verso |year=1998 |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The village scouts were to counter the [[Communist Party of Thailand|communist insurgency]] and the pro-democracy movement of the 1970s. Soon after its creation, five million Thais (10 percent of the population) went through the organisation's initiation rite and took its five-day training course.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The Village Scouts conducted the anti-leftist rally that led to the [[Thammasat University massacre]] and bloody coup d'état on 6 October 1976.&lt;ref name="Somboon"&gt;{{Citation |first=Somboon |last=Suksamran |title=Buddhism and politics in Thailand |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year=1982 |pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Village Scouts disappeared around 1981, but were revived around 2004 against the backdrop of the [[South Thailand insurgency|Muslim separatist conflict]] in south Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Alexander |last=Horstmann |title=Violence, Subversion and Creativity in the Thai-Malaysian Borderland |work=Borderscapes: Hidden Geographies and Politics at Territory's Edge |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=2007 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The village scout concept was extended to {{lang|th|ลูกเสือบนเครือข่ายอินเทอร์เน็ต}} ('Village Scouts on the Internet') internet activities with the creation of the  "cyber scouts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2010/07/02/from-village-scouts-to-cyber-scouts/ |title=From Village Scouts to Cyber Scouts |author=Nicholas Farrelly  |date=2 July 2010 |work=New Mandala |accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thahan Phran===
{{main|Thahan Phran}}
The 10,600 member Thahan Phran ("Rangers") was formed as a volunteer [[militia]] force deployed to active trouble spots along the Cambodian and Burmese borders. The paramilitary organization had 32 regiments and 196 companies. The Thahan Phran gained considerable publicity and incurred significant casualties during [[Vietnamese border raids in Thailand|Vietnamese bombardments and local assaults]] along the Cambodian border.&lt;ref&gt;Ball D.

The '''Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal''' ({{lang-fr|Médaille canadienne du maintien de la paix}}) is a [[campaign medal]] created in 1988 to recognize the contributions of all Canadian [[Peacekeeping|Peacekeepers]] towards the ultimate goal of peace,&lt;ref name=DND&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhr-ddhr/chc-tdh/chart-tableau-eng.asp?ref=CPSM| last=Department of National Defence| authorlink=Department of National Defence (Canada)| title=DH&amp;R Home &gt; Canadian Honours Chart &gt; Canadian Peace Keeping Service Medal (CPSM)| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=31 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[United Nations]] [[Department of Peacekeeping Operations]] was awarded that year's [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

==History==
In 1988, the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] was awarded to United Nations Peacekeepers, in recognition of their efforts over more than 50 years to establish and maintain peace.&lt;ref name="McCreery2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher McCreery|title=The Canadian honours system|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nI9qJsEsT6gC&amp;pg=PA181|date=24 March 2005|publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd.|isbn=978-1-55002-554-5|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act inspired the creation of the Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal, its purpose being to recognize all [[Canadians]], including serving and former members of the [[Canadian Forces]], members of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], other police services, and Canadian [[civilians]], who contributed to peace on certain missions.&lt;ref name="McCreery2005"/&gt; Some time was involved in getting the medal to the presentation stage, but, as with the creation of any major honour or award, the approval of this award involved consultation with a large number of interested individuals.

==Design==
The Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal was designed by [[Bruce W. Beatty]] and is in the form of a {{convert|36|mm|in}} diameter [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]] with, on the obverse, the words ''PEACEKEEPING • SERVICE DE LA PAIX'', separated by maple leaves, surrounding a rendition of the three Canadian Peacekeeper figures that top the [[Peacekeeping Monument]] in [[Ottawa]]; one is an unarmed [[United Nations]] Military Observer, holding [[binoculars]], the second, a woman, shoulders a [[radio]], while the third stands guard with a [[rifle]], and above them is a [[dove]], the international symbol of peace. The medal's reverse shows the word ''CANADA'' below a maple leaf surrounded by a laurel wreath and bearing the [[Royal Cypher]] of Queen [[Elizabeth II]],&lt;ref name=DND /&gt; symbolizing her roles as both [[fount of honour]] and [[Commander-in-Chief]] of her various forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhr-ddhr/chc-tdh/chart-tableau-eng.asp?ref=SM| last=Department of National Defence| authorlink=Department of National Defence (Canada)| title=DH&amp;R Home &gt; Canadian Honours Chart &gt; Sacrifice Medal (SM)| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2 September 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114162425/http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhr-ddhr/chc-tdh/chart-tableau-eng.asp?ref=SM#| archive-date=2009-11-14| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single-toe claw attaches the top of the medal to the centre of a slotted bar on which is another maple leaf. This medallion is worn at the left chest, suspended on a 31.8mm wide ribbon coloured with vertical stripes in the shade of blue used by the United Nations, green (representing service), and Canada's official colours: red (also indicitave of blood shed in the service of peace), and white (also the colour of peace).&lt;ref name=DND /&gt;

==Eligibility==
The Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal recognizes Canadian Peacekeepers deployed outside Canada for a minimum of 30 days, which includes members of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], other police officers, and civilians who served with the forces on peacekeeping missions. As of September 2003, some 68,000 Peacekeeping Service Medals had been awarded.&lt;ref name=DND /&gt;

'''Catherine Feuillet''' ({{IPA-fr|katʁin fœjɛ|-|Fr-Catherine Feuillet.ogg}}; born July 1965) is a French [[geneticist]] who is the head of trait research at [[Bayer CropScience]] and a co-chair of the  International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC). Feuillet has been working on plant genetics since 1994 when she completed post-doctoral studies at the Swiss Federal Institute for Agroecology. She wrote her thesis on Lignification of Eucalyptus which is the study of how wood is formed on a cellular basis. After that she moved on to the University of Zurich in 1997 where she was a junior group leader investigating fungal disease resistance in plant genomes. In 2008, she and her team successfully published the first mapping of the largest wheat chromosome, 3B and in 2014, they successfully completed mapping 3B's sequencing and published a draft of the entire wheat genome. She has been awarded the Prix Foulon from the French Academy of Science, the gold ''Trophée de la Femme'', was honored as a Chevalier of the [[Legion of Honour]], and received the Jean Dufrenoy Prize from the [[Académie d'Agriculture]] of France.
Today Feuillet works as the head of Trait Research at [[Bayer CropScience]] where she is actively trying to decrypt the remaining 20 wheat chromosomes so as to identify and manipulate traits that would help eliminate biotic and abiotic stressors that inhibit the yield of wheat in the changing environment. She is also the head of the project, Breedwheat, which works to manipulate the wheat genome to improve the yield of wheat in the changing environment due to [[global warming]] because it is a basic food source for upwards of 2 billion people worldwide.

==Education and Early Life==
Catherine Feuillet was born in [[Orléans]],&lt;ref name=CathFeulselonSemeurHebdo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breedwheat.fr/files/2011.10.14%20Semeur%20Hebdo%20Catherine%20Feuillet.pdf|title=Catherine Feuillet, une chercheuse en or... vert| author=Jean-Philippe Monjot|language=French|date=14 October 2011|publisher=Le Semeur Hebdo|page=3|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 130&amp;nbsp;km (80 miles) south of [[Paris]], and attained her education as a [[geneticist]] and [[Molecular biology|molecular biologist]].&lt;ref name="inra bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=INRA Scientist Catherine Feuillet named AAAS Fellow|url=http://presse.inra.fr/en/Resources/Press-releases/Feuillet-AAAS-Fellow-2011|publisher=Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique|accessdate=6 November 2015|location=Clermont-Ferrand, France|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993, she earned her doctorate at the [[Paul Sabatier University]] in [[Toulouse]], France. Between 1994 and 1997, she completed post-doctoral studies at the Federal Institute for Agroecology in [[Zürich]], studying the genomes of wheat and barley. In 1994 Feuillet finished her thesis on the eucalyptus plant and enzymes used in the wood formation process. She took her thesis to the Swiss Federal Institute for Agroecology in Zürich, Switzerland. She taught two courses as a professor’s assistant and began her work on the wheat genome. At the Swiss Federal Institute for Agroecology she worked in a laboratory under the supervision of Dr. B.

==Wheat Genome Sequencing==
[[File:Weizenähre Detailansicht.JPG|thumb|Weizenähre Detailansicht]]
In 2004 Feuillet began her work on the wheat genome, decrypting the chromosome 3B. Decrypting the chromosome took 4 years, but in 2008 she finally finished and presented the chromosome to the scientific community in the journal Science.&lt;ref name=CathFeulselonSemeurHebdo/&gt; This required making a map of one of the 42 chromosomes, placing over 1400 molecular markers throughout its 995 million base pairs. The work had never been done before because the sequence was large and had extreme amounts of repetitive sequences, which make it difficult to match the pieces together in the sequence. The wheat genome was also difficult to sequence because of its chromosome arrangement: the plant has three sets of chromosomes in one nucleus, called a hexaploid arrangement. The chromosome she chose to sequence, 3B, is the largest chromosome on the entire genome, and is by itself double the size of the entire rice genome.&lt;ref name="Pennisi"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2008/10/giant-leap-wheat-genome | title =A Giant Leap for Wheat Genome | last =Pennisi | first =Elizabeth | date =2 October 2008 | website =Science | publisher =American Association for the Advancement of Science | access-date =14 March 2016 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, the IWGSC announced that they had assembled, using de novo shotgun techniques, a high quality reference sequence of the bread wheat genome. The project was made possible through a collaboration of IPK Gatersleben in Germany, the University of Saskatchewan’s Crop Development Centre in Canada, Kansas State University, and the Global Institute of Food Security in Canada.&lt;ref name="Bethesda"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.wheatgenome.org/News/Press-releases/Wheat-Genome-Sequencing-Gets-Major-Boost | title =Wheat Genome Sequencing Gets Major Boost | last = | first = | date =6 January 2016| website = | publisher =International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium | access-date =15 March 2016 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This “shotgun” approach allows the sequencing to be done very quickly, but it can be rather inaccurate as compared to the “map-based” sequence Feuillet used when she sequenced the 3B chromosome. The shotgun approach is approximated to be 94% accurate, while the rest of the chromosome is about 53% accurate using the second approach.&lt;ref name="money needed"/&gt; This data from the second approach, released in collaboration with the IWGSC, will be used along with the physical-map based approach to individual chromosomes, including Feuillet’s sequencing of 3B, to produce the full genome by 2017.&lt;ref name="Bethesda"/&gt;

Sequencing the wheat genome completely is important for producers all over the world. Wheat currently makes up more than 20% of all calories consumed in the world, and as the global population increases, so does the need for wheat.&lt;ref name="Bethesda"/&gt; Recently, however, wheat production has been stagnating because technological advances can’t keep up with negative economic and natural factors.&lt;ref name="productivity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agprofessional.com/news/commentary-working-improve-productivity-gap-wheat-crops | title =Working To Improve the Productivity Gap in Wheat Crops | last =Feuillet | first =Catherine | date =9 December 2015 | website =Farm Journal, Inc. | access-date =14 March 2016 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total demand for wheat is expected to increase by 70 percent by the year 2050—an increase of about 1.6 percent per year (Gonzalez). By sequencing the genome, scientists will be able to research ways to improve the efficiency of the crop through means like genetic engineering, which could allow production of wheat in areas with low nutrient levels.&lt;ref name="Bethesda"/&gt;

==Current Research==
Feuillet is still continuing her work on sequencing wheat genomes today in order to contribute to the field of agronomy. Her work focuses on genes that would have medicinal advancements that would help prevent illnesses in plants.&lt;ref name=CathFeulselonSemeurHebdo/&gt;

To continue her work on the wheat genome Feuillet now heads the project, Breedwheat, which receives 34 million euros annually and has a team of 128 researchers. The project is trying to manipulate wheat to adapt to the changing environment caused by global warming. Because wheat is a necessary and basic food for 30% of the global population, Feuillet found it especially important to ensure the survival of wheat as a food source as the human species influences the global conditions at an ever more rapid pace.&lt;ref name=CathFeulselonSemeurHebdo/&gt;

Feuillet currently leads Trait Research at Bayer CropScience and is working on “identifying the genes responsible for yield and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses.”&lt;ref name="makers"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.research.bayer.com/en/wheat-makers.aspx | title =The Wheat Makers - Research Magazine | website =The Bayer Scientific Magazine | publisher =Bayer CropScience | access-date =15 March 2016 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since upwards of 2 billion people worldwide rely on wheat a main food source, researchers at Bayer CropScience like Catherine Feuillet, Steve Patterson, and Edward Souza are working on increasing the yield of wheat without increasing the amount of land required for that yield. Feuillet’s work at decoding the wheat genome is essential in increasing the yield because once decoded, the genome could be modified so that yield inhibitors could be abolished. This information is then used by Souza, the Head of Wheat Breeding Research at Bayer CropScience, to develop markers to find the genes that produce the desired trait.&lt;ref name="makers"/&gt;

'''Collective bargaining''' is a process of [[negotiation]] between employers and a group of employees aimed at agreements to regulate working salaries, working conditions, benefits, and other aspects of workers' compensation and rights for workers. The interests of the employees are commonly presented by representatives of a [[trade union]] to which the employees belong. The [[collective agreement]]s reached by these negotiations usually set out wage scales, working hours, training, health and safety, [[overtime]], [[Grievance (labour)|grievance]] mechanisms, and rights to participate in workplace or company affairs.&lt;ref name="uslabor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm |title=BLS Information |date=February 28, 2008 |work=Glossary |publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Division of Information Services |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Trade union|union]] may negotiate with a single employer (who is typically representing a company's shareholders) or may negotiate with a group of businesses, depending on the country, to reach an industry-wide agreement. A collective agreement functions as a [[Labor and employment law|labour contract]] between an employer and one or more unions. Collective bargaining consists of the process of negotiation between representatives of a union and employers (generally represented by management, or, in some countries such as Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands, by an [[employers' organization]]) in respect of the terms and conditions of employment of employees, such as wages, hours of work, working conditions, grievance procedures, and about the rights and responsibilities of trade unions. The parties often refer to the result of the negotiation as a ''collective bargaining agreement'' (CBA) or as a ''collective employment agreement'' (CEA).

==History==
[[File:BeatriceWebb.jpg|thumb|upright|Beatrice Webb in 1894]]
The term "collective bargaining" was first used in 1891 by [[Beatrice Webb]], a founder of the field of industrial relations in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Wilkinson et al. eds.|title=Handbook of Research on Employee Voice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cd9nAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA227|year=2014|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the sort of collective negotiations and agreements that had existed since the rise of trade unions during the 18th century.

In the United States, the [[National Labor Relations Act]] of 1935  made it illegal for any employer to deny union rights to an employee. The issue of unionizing government employees in a [[public-sector trade union]] was much more controversial until the 1950s. In 1962 President [[John F. Kennedy]] issued an executive order granting federal employees the right to unionize.

An issue of jurisdiction surfaced in ''National Labor Relations Board v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago ''(1979) when the Supreme Court held that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) could not assert jurisdiction over a church-operated school because such jurisdiction would violate the First Amendment establishment of freedom of religion and the separation of church of state.&lt;ref&gt;Pynes, J.E. &amp; Lombardi (2011) Human Resources Management for Healthcare Organizations.

The right to collectively bargain is recognized through international human rights conventions. Article 23 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] identifies the ability to organize trade unions as a fundamental human right.&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations General Assembly]] (1948). [[s:Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Article 23|"Article 23"]]. ''[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]''. Paris. Retrieved August 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Item 2(a) of the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organization's]] ''[[Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work]]'' defines the "[[freedom of association]] and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining" as an essential right of workers.&lt;ref&gt;International Labour Organization (1998). ''[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20081027221608/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/declaris/DECLARATIONWEB.static_jump?var_language=EN&amp;var_pagename=DECLARATIONTEXT Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work]''. 86th Session: Geneva. Retrieved August 29, 2007.
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention]], 1948 (C087) and several other conventions specifically protect collective bargaining through the creation of [[international labour standards]] that discourage countries from violating workers' rights to associate and collectively bargain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C087 - Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C087|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007 the Supreme Court of Canada extensively reviewed the rationale for regarding collective bargaining as a human right. In the case of ''Facilities Subsector Bargaining Association v. British Columbia'', the Court made the following observations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The right to bargain collectively with an employer enhances the human dignity, liberty and autonomy of workers by giving them the opportunity to influence the establishment of workplace rules and thereby gain some control over a major aspect of their lives, namely their work… Collective bargaining is not simply an instrument for pursuing external ends…rather [it] is intrinsically valuable as an experience in self-government… Collective bargaining permits workers to achieve a form of [[workplace democracy]] and to ensure the rule of law in the workplace. Workers gain a voice to influence the establishment of rules that control a major aspect of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;''Health Services and Support – Facilities Subsector Bargaining Assn. v. British Columbia'' [2007] [http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2007/2007scc27/2007scc27.html SCC 27] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712233951/http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2007/2007scc27/2007scc27.html |date=July 12, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Empirical findings==
* Union members and other workers covered by [[collective agreement]]s get, on average, a wage markup over their nonunionized (or uncovered) counterparts. Such a markup is typically 5 to 10 percent in industrial countries.&lt;ref name="aidt2002"&gt;{{cite web |author=Toke Aidt and Zafiris Tzannatos|title=Unions and Collective Bargaining |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unions tend to equalize the [[income distribution]], especially between skilled and unskilled workers.&lt;ref name="aidt2002" /&gt;
* The [[deadweight loss|welfare loss]] associated with unions is 0.2 to 0.5 of [[GDP]], which is similar to [[monopoly|monopolies]] in product markets.&lt;ref name="aidt2002" /&gt;

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the [[National Labor Relations Act]] (1935) covers most collective agreements in the private sector. This act makes it illegal for employers to discriminate, spy on, harass, or terminate the employment of workers because of their union membership or to retaliate against them for engaging in organizing campaigns or other "concerted activities," to form [[company union]]s, or to refuse to engage in collective bargaining with the union that represents their employees. It is also illegal to require any employee to join a union as a condition of employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Can I be required to be a union member or pay dues to a union?|url=http://www.nrtw.org/a/a_1_p.htm|publisher=National Right To Work|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unions are also able to secure safe work conditions and equitable pay for their labor.

At a workplace where a majority of workers have voted for union representation, a committee of employees and union representatives negotiate a contract with the management regarding wages, hours, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment, such as protection from termination of employment without just cause. Individual negotiation is prohibited. Once the workers' committee and management have agreed on a contract, it is then put to a vote of all workers at the workplace. If approved, the contract is usually in force for a fixed term of years, and when that term is up, it is then renegotiated between employees and management. Sometimes there are disputes over the union contract; this particularly occurs in cases of workers fired without just cause in a union workplace. These then go to [[arbitration]], which is similar to an informal court hearing; a neutral arbitrator then rules whether the termination or other contract breach is extant, and if it is, orders that it be corrected.

In 24 U.S. states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrtw.org/right-to-work-states/|title=National Right to Work Foundation  » Right to Work States|author=|date=|website=www.nrtw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; employees who are working in a unionized shop may be required to contribute towards the cost of representation (such as at disciplinary hearings) if their fellow employees have negotiated a union security clause in their contract with management. Dues are generally 1–2% of pay. However, union members and other workers covered by collective agreements get, on average, a 5-10% wage markup over their nonunionized (or uncovered) counterparts.&lt;ref name="aidt2002"/&gt;  Some states, especially in the south-central and south-eastern regions of the U.S., have outlawed union security clauses; this can cause controversy, as it allows some net beneficiaries of the union contract to avoid paying their portion of the costs of contract negotiation.  Regardless of state, the Supreme Court has held that the Act prevents a person's union dues from being used without consent to fund political causes that may be opposed to the individual's personal politics. Instead, in states where union security clauses are permitted, such dissenters may elect to pay only the proportion of dues which go directly toward representation of workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Communications Workers of America v. Beck|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/487/735/|accessdate=2011-08-27}}, 487 U.S. 735.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[industrial revolution]] brought a swell of labour organizing in the US.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The [[American Federation of Labor]] was formed in 1886, providing unprecedented bargaining powers for a variety of workers.&lt;ref name="curriculum"&gt;Illinois Labor History Society.

The [[Railway Labor Act]] (1926) required employers to bargain collectively with unions.

In 1931, the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], in the case of ''Texas &amp; N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway Clerks'', upheld the act's prohibition of employer interference in the selection of bargaining representatives.&lt;ref name="curriculum"/&gt; In 1962, President [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] signed an executive order giving public-employee unions the right to collectively bargain with federal government agencies.&lt;ref name="curriculum"/&gt;

The [[Office of Labor-Management Standards]], part of the [[United States Department of Labor]], is required to collect all collective bargaining agreements covering 1,000 or more workers, excluding those involving railroads and airlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collective Bargaining Agreements File: Online Listings of Private and Public Sector Agreements|url=http://www.dol.gov/olms/regs/compliance/cba/index.htm|website=Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS)|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide public access to these collections through [http://www.dol.gov/olms/regs/compliance/cba/index.htm their website].

==OECD==
Only one in three [[OECD]] employees have wages which were agreed on through collective bargaining. The organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with its 36 members, has become an outspoken proponent for collective bargaining as a way to ensure that the falling unemployment also leads to higher wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/nyheter/news-2018/article.2018-07-04.6865902732|title=OECD: The crisis is over, but collective bargaining is needed for wage growth — Nordic Labour Journal|first=|last=lars|date=|website=www.nordiclabourjournal.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==
In Sweden the coverage of collective agreements is very high despite the absence of legal mechanisms to extend agreements to whole industries. In 2016, 84% of all private sector employees were covered by collective agreements, 100% of public sector employees and in all 90% (referring to the whole labor market).&lt;ref&gt;Anders Kjellberg (2018) [http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/en/publications/kollektivavtalens-tackningsgrad-samt-organisationsgraden-hos-arbetsgivarfoerbund-och-fackfoerbund(ac892d07-5fbe-4e0e-a441-aa342da66c6a).html ''Kollektivavtalens täckningsgrad samt organisationsgraden hos arbetsgivarförbund och fackförbund''], Department of Sociology, Lund University.

The '''Commodity Distribution Program''', a program under Section 14 of the [[Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act]] (NSLA) (P.L. 79-396, as amended), requires the [[Secretary of Agriculture]] to use agricultural surplus removal funds (Section 32) and [[Commodity Credit Corporation]] (CCC) funds to buy commodities for child and elderly nutrition programs.  The Secretary is directed to use Section 32 funds not needed for other purposes and CCC funds (if stocks are not available) to buy commodities for donation to maintain the annually programmed level of commodity assistance for Child and Elderly Nutrition programs mandated by the [[National School Lunch Act]], [[Child Nutrition Act]] (P.L. 89-642, as amended; 42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq.), and [[Older Americans Act]] (P.L. 89-73; 42 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.).

The '''Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System II''' ('''CAPPS II''') was a program of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) instituted to increase security at airports by assessing the risk level of passengers before they're allowed to board. CAPPS II searched through information stored in [[government]] and commercial [[database]]s and assigned a color-coded level of risk to each passenger. Amid controversy from such organizations as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] (EPIC), and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF), the program was terminated by [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] in August 2004. The program was then replaced by a similar program called [[Secure Flight]] in early 2005 generating the same concerns over privacy and civil liberties. However, due to public concerns,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Secure Flight is not due to become fully operational until 2010.{{Update inline|date=November 2014|That was at least four years ago.}} CAPPS II grounded innocent [[United States|Americans]] due to false positives. One notable example is the grounding of Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Kennedy: Airline security risk?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56971">{{Public Infrastructure}}
'''Critical infrastructure protection''' ('''CIP''') is a concept that relates to the preparedness and response to serious incidents that involve the [[critical infrastructure]] of a region or nation.

The American [[Presidential directive]] PDD-63 of May 1998 set up a national program of "Critical Infrastructure Protection".&lt;ref name="Presidential directive PDD-63"&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/pdd/pdd-63.htm Presidential directive PDD-63]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 the [[NIST Cybersecurity Framework]] was published after further presidential directives.

In [[Europe]], the equivalent [[European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection]] (EPCIP) refers to the doctrine or specific programs created as a result of the [[European Commission]]'s directive EU COM(2006) 786 which designates European critical infrastructure that, in case of fault, incident, or attack, could impact both the country where it is hosted and at least one other [[Member State of the European Union|European Member State]]. Member states are obliged to adopt the 2006 directive into their national statutes.

== History of the U.S. CIP ==

The U.S. CIP is a national program to ensure the security of vulnerable and interconnected [[infrastructure]]s of the [[United States]]. In May 1998, President [[Bill Clinton]] issued [[presidential directive]] PDD-63 on the subject of critical infrastructure protection.&lt;ref name="Presidential directive PDD-63"/&gt; This recognized certain parts of the national infrastructure as critical to the national and economic security of the United States and the well-being of its citizenry, and required steps to be taken to protect it.

This was updated on December 17, 2003, by President Bush through Homeland Security Presidential Directive HSPD-7 for '''Critical Infrastructure Identification, Prioritization, and Protection'''.&lt;ref name="HSPD7bush"/&gt; The directive describes the United States as having some critical infrastructure that is "so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety."&lt;ref name=HSPD7bush&gt;{{cite web|title=December 17, 2003 Homeland Security Presidential Directive/Hspd-7|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/12/20031217-5.html|publisher=White House Archives|accessdate=29 July 2014|date=17 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The systems and networks that make up the infrastructure of society are often taken for granted, yet a disruption to just one of those systems can have dire consequences across other sectors.

Take, for example, a [[computer virus]] that disrupts the [[Pipeline transport|distribution of natural gas]] across a region. This could lead to a consequential reduction in [[Electricity generation|electrical power generation]], which in turn leads to the forced shutdown of [[SCADA|computerized controls]] and communications. Road traffic, air traffic, and rail transportation might then become affected. [[Emergency services]] might also be hampered.

An entire region can become debilitated because some critical elements in the infrastructure become disabled through [[natural disaster]]. While potentially in contravention of the [[Geneva Conventions]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/93.htm Article 52 and 54 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949], and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts ("Geneva Conventions")&lt;/ref&gt; military forces have also recognized that it can cripple an enemy's ability to resist by attacking key elements of its civilian and military infrastructure.

The federal government has developed a standardized description of critical infrastructure, in order to facilitate monitoring and preparation for disabling events. The government requires private industry in each critical economic sector to:

* Assess its vulnerabilities to both physical or cyber attacks
* Plan to eliminate significant vulnerabilities
* Develop systems to identify and prevent attempted attacks
* Alert, contain and rebuff attacks and then, with the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), to rebuild essential capabilities in the aftermath

===Infrastructure sectors===
CIP defines sectors and organizational responsibilities in a standard way:

*[[Bank|Banking and finance]]: - The [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] is responsible for coordinating the protection of not just systems but also [[Bank run|maintaining public confidence]], through industry initiatives such as the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsisac.com Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center]&lt;/ref&gt; (ISAC)
*[[Transport]]ation: - The [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] is responsible for protecting the road, rail, air, and water transportation infrastructure, including computer-controlled [[just in time (business)|just-in-time delivery]] systems, optimization of distribution through [[Transportation hub|hubs]], and traffic and operations centers that are consolidated into key locations, and regulation of the transport of hazardous materials.
*[[List of energy topics#Energy infrastructure|Power]]: - The [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] oversees [[Energy supply|energy supplies]] including electricity, oil, and gas, and works with the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] for the protection of nuclear materials and power. Note that CIP in this sector is different from [[energy security]], which is the politics and economics of supply. Additionally, operating under the auspices of the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] is the [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] (NERC), a [[non-profit organization]] that defines and enforces reliability standards for the bulk power system.
*Information and [[List of basic telecommunication topics#Types of telecommunication networks|communications]]: - Overseen by the [[Department of Commerce]], most areas of life rely on telecommunications and information technology.

[[Image:Oklahomacitybombing-fema-1277.jpg|thumb|right|Oklahoma City bombing: Search and rescue teams formed from various emergency services coordinated by [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]]]]

*Federal and [[Municipal infrastructure|municipal services]]: - Overseen jointly by Federal and State agencies.  They guarantee continuity of government at the federal, state, and local levels to meet for provision of essential services.
*[[Emergency services]]: - Overseen by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services]], this includes [[Emergency medical services|emergency health services]] and [[public health]]
*[[Fire departments]]: - Overseen by the Federal Emergency Management Agency [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]].
*[[Law enforcement agency|Law enforcement agencies]]: - Overseen jointly by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] to ensure the orderly running of activities during times of threat or crises.
*[[Public works]]: - Overseen by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]].  This includes safe water systems and drainage.

In 2003 the remit was expanded to include:

*Agriculture and food, with the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] overseeing the safe supply of meat, poultry, and egg products.
*National monuments and icons, under the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]

With much of the critical infrastructure privately owned, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) depends on commercial infrastructure to support its normal operations. The [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] are also involved in [[intelligence analysis]] with friendly countries.

In May 2007 the DHS completed its sector-specific plans (SSP) for coordinating and dealing with critical events.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/xprevprot/programs/gc_1179866197607.shtm Department of Homeland Security - Sector-Specific Plans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306124302/http://www.dhs.gov/xprevprot/programs/gc_1179866197607.shtm |date=2011-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Continuity of government (COG) in time of a catastrophic event can be used to preserve the government as seen fit by the president, at which point the welfare of the government can be placed above the welfare of the citizenry of the United States ensuring that the government is preserved to rebuild the economy and country when it is deemed safe to return to the surface of the United States of America.

==Significance==
On March 9, 1999, Deputy Defense Secretary [[John Hamre]] warned the [[United States Congress]] of a cyber terrorist "electronic [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]" saying, "It is not going to be against Navy ships sitting in a Navy shipyard. It is going to be against commercial infrastructure". Later this fear was qualified by President Clinton after reports of actual cyber terrorist attacks in 2000: "I think it was an alarm. I don't think it was Pearl Harbor. We lost our Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor. I don't think the analogous loss was that great.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/news/2000/02/000215-secure-wh1.htm Federation of American Scientists February 15, 2000 ''Presidential remarks on Computer Security'']&lt;/ref&gt;"

There are [[Timeline of computer security hacker history|many examples of computer systems that have been hacked]] or victims of extortion. One such example occurred in September 1995 where a Russian national allegedly masterminded the break-in of [[Citicorp]]'s [[electronic funds transfer]] system and was ordered to stand trial in the United States. A gang of [[Black hat hacking|hackers]] under his leadership had breached Citicorp's security 40 times during 1994. They were able to transfer $12 million from customer accounts and withdraw an estimated $400,000.

In the past, the systems and networks of the infrastructure elements were physically and logically independent and separate. They had little interaction or connection with each other or other sectors of the infrastructure.  With advances in technology, the systems within each sector became automated, and interlinked through computers and communications facilities. As a result, the flow of electricity, oil, gas, and telecommunications throughout the country are linked—albeit sometimes indirectly—but the resulting linkages blur traditional security borders.

While this increased reliance on interlinked capabilities helps make the economy and nation more efficient and perhaps stronger, it also makes the country more vulnerable to disruption and attack. This interdependent and interrelated infrastructure is more vulnerable to physical and cyber disruptions because it has become a complex system with single points of failure.  In the past an incident that would have been an isolated failure can now cause widespread disruption because of cascading effects.&lt;ref&gt;Austen Givens, "[http://www.emergencymgmt.com/disaster/Deepwater-Horizon-Oil-Spill-Critical-Infrastructure-052711.html?page=1&amp; Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Is An Ominous Sign for Critical Infrastructure's Future]", May 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, capabilities within the information and communication sector have enabled the United States to reshape its government and business processes, while becoming increasingly software driven. One catastrophic failure in this sector now has the potential to bring down multiple systems including air traffic control, emergency services, banking, trains, electrical power, and dam control.

The elements of the infrastructure themselves are also considered possible targets of [[terrorism]]. Traditionally, critical infrastructure elements have been lucrative targets for anyone wanting to attack another country. Now, because the infrastructure has become a national lifeline, terrorists can achieve high economic and political value by attacking elements of it. Disrupting or even disabling the infrastructure may reduce the ability to defend the nation, erode public confidence in critical services, and reduce economic strength.  Additionally, well chosen terrorist attacks can become easier and less costly than traditional warfare because of the interdependence of infrastructure elements. These infrastructure elements can become easier targets where there is a low probability of detection.

The elements of the infrastructure are also increasingly vulnerable to a dangerous mix of traditional and nontraditional types of threats. Traditional and non-traditional threats include equipment failures, human error, weather and natural causes, physical attacks, and cyber attacks. For each of these threats, the cascading effect caused by single points of failure has the potential to pose dire and far-reaching consequences.

=== Challenges ===
There are fears that the frequency and severity of critical infrastructure incidents will increase in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Paul J. Maliszewski, "[http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07092008-091641/unrestricted/MaliszewskiPThesis.pdf Modeling Critical Vaccine Supply Location: Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Population in Central Florida] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320000303/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07092008-091641/unrestricted/MaliszewskiPThesis.pdf |date=2009-03-20 }}" (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although efforts are under way, there is no unified national capability to protect the interrelated aspects of the country's infrastructure. One reason for this is that a good understanding of the inter-relationships does not exist. There is also no consensus on how the elements of the infrastructure mesh together, or how each element functions and affects the others.  Securing national infrastructure depends on understanding the relationships among its elements. Thus when one sector scheduled a three-week drill to mimic the effects of a [[pandemic flu]], even though two-thirds of the participants claimed to have [[business continuity]] plans in place, barely half reported that their plan was moderately effective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/blog/archives/2007/11/_how_well_can_w.html?cid=nl_wallstreettech_week How Well Can Wall Street Handle Pandemic Flu? Drill Results Are Mixed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718225413/http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/blog/archives/2007/11/_how_well_can_w.html?cid=nl_wallstreettech_week |date=2011-07-18 }} Wall Street &amp; Technology&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical infrastructure protection requires the development of a national capability to identify and monitor the critical elements and to determine when and if the elements are under attack or are the victim of destructive natural occurrences. CIP is important because it is the link between risk management and infrastructure assurance. It provides the capability needed to eliminate potential vulnerabilities in the critical infrastructure.

CIP practitioners determine vulnerabilities and analyze alternatives in order to prepare for incidents. They focus on improving the capability to detect and warn of impending attacks on, and system failures within, the critical elements of the national infrastructure.

==Organization and structure==
PDD-63 mandated the formation of a national structure for critical infrastructure protection. To accomplish this one of the primary actions was to produce a National Infrastructure Assurance Plan, or NIAP, later renamed National Infrastructure Protection Plan or NIPP.

The different entities of the national CIP structure work together as a partnership between the government and the public sectors. Each department and agency of the federal government is responsible for protecting its portion of the government's critical infrastructure. In addition, there are [[Administration of federal assistance in the United States|grants]] made available through the [[Department of Homeland Security]] for municipal and private entities to use for CIP and security purposes. These include grants for emergency management, water security training, rail, transit and port security, metropolitan medical response, [[Law enforcement agency|LEA]] terrorism prevention programs and the Urban Areas Security Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfda.gov 2006 Catalog of Federal domestic assistance grants] (CFDA), including security projects&lt;/ref&gt;

PDD-63 identified certain functions related to critical infrastructure protection that must be performed chiefly by the federal government. These are national defense, foreign affairs, intelligence, and law enforcement. Each lead agency for these special functions appoints a senior official to serve as a functional coordinator for the federal government. In 2008 a mobile PDA-based Vulnerability Assessment Security Survey Tool (VASST) was introduced to speed physical security assessment of critical infrastructure by law enforcement to meet compliance requirements of PDD-63.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.prleap.com/pr/125854/ Aegis Bleu Launches VASST, Vulnerability Assessment Security Survey Tool]", ''[[PR Leap]]'' 11 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Infrastructure Assurance Plan / National Infrastructure Protection Plan ===
For each of the identified major sectors of the critical infrastructure, the federal government appointed a Sector Liaison Official from a designated Lead Agency.  A private sector counterpart, a Sector Coordinator, was also identified. Together, the two sector representatives, one federal government and one corporate, were responsible for developing a sector NIAP.

In addition, each department and agency of the federal government was responsible for developing its own CIP plan for protecting its portion of the federal government's critical infrastructure.  The federal department and agency plans were assimilated with the sector NIAPs to create one comprehensive National Infrastructure Assurance Plan.  Additionally the national structure must ensure there is a national CIP program. This program includes responsibilities such as education and awareness, [[threat assessment]] and investigation, and research.

The process includes assessments of:
*Protection -  Can be defined as the state of being defended, safeguarded, or shielded from injury, loss, or destruction from natural or unnatural forces.
*Vulnerability – The quality of being susceptible to attack or injury, warranted or unwarranted, by accident or by design.
*Risk – The possibility or likelihood of being attacked or injured.
*Mitigation – The ability to alleviate, reduce, or moderate a vulnerability, thus reducing or eliminating risk.

===Controversy===
There have been public criticisms of the mechanisms and implementation of some security initiatives and grants, with claims they are being led by the same companies who can benefit,&lt;ref name=forbes2002&gt;Elisa Williams, "[https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/0204/064_print.html Climate of Fear]", ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, 2 April 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and that they are encouraging an unnecessary [[culture of fear]]. Commentators note that these initiatives started directly after the collapse of the [[Cold War]], raising the concern that this was simply a diversion of the [[military-industrial]] complex away from a funding area which was shrinking and into a richer previously civilian arena.

Grants have been distributed across the different states even though the perceived risk is not evenly spread, leading to accusations of [[pork barrel]] politics that directs money and jobs towards marginal voting areas. The Urban Areas Security Initiative grant program has been particularly controversial, with the 2006 infrastructure list covering 77,000 assets, including a popcorn factory and a hot dog stand.&lt;ref name=nytimes2006&gt;Eric Lipton, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/12/washington/12assets.html Terror Target List]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;   The 2007 criteria were reduced to 2,100 and now those facilities must make a much stronger case to become eligible for grants.&lt;ref name=Zack&gt;Zack Phillips, "[http://www.govexec.com/features/0807-01/0807-01s3.htm Security Theater]," ''Government Executive'', 1 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While well-intentioned, some of the results have also been questioned regarding claims of poorly designed and intrusive [[security theater]] that distracts attention and money from more pressing issues or creates damaging side effects.

An absence of comparative risk analysis and benefits tracking it has made it difficult to counter such allegations with authority. In order to better understand this, and ultimately direct effort more productively, a Risk Management and Analysis Office was recently created in the National Protection and Programs directorate at the [[Department of Homeland Security]].

==Department of Defense and CIP==
The [[U.S. Department of Defense]] is responsible for protecting its portion of the government's critical infrastructure.  But as part of the CIP program, DoD has responsibilities that traverse both the national and department-wide critical infrastructure.

PDD-63 identified the responsibilities DoD had for critical infrastructure protection. First, DoD had to identify its own critical assets and infrastructures and provide assurance through analysis, assessment, and remediation.  DoD was also responsible for identifying and monitoring the national and international infrastructure requirements of industry and other government agencies, all of which needed to be included in the protection planning.  DoD also addressed the assurance and protection of commercial assets and infrastructure services in DoD acquisitions.  Other DoD responsibilities for CIP included assessing the potential impact on military operations that would result from the loss or compromise of infrastructure service.  There were also requirements for monitoring DoD operations, detecting and responding to infrastructure incidents, and providing department indications and warnings as part of the national process.  Ultimately, DoD was responsible for supporting national critical infrastructure protection.

In response to the requirements identified in PDD-63, DoD categorized its own critical assets by sector, in a manner similar to the national CIP organization. The DoD identified a slightly different list of infrastructure sectors for those areas that specifically required protection by DoD.  DoD’s organizational structure for critical infrastructure protection reflects, complements, and effectively interacts with the national structure for CIP.

===DoD sectors===
There are ten defense critical infrastructure sectors that are protected by the DoD. These include:

*'''Financial Services''' - Defense financial services support activities related to officially appropriated funds. These activities include the disbursement of cash, receipt of funds, and acceptance of deposits for credit to officially designated Treasury general accounts. This sector also provides financial services to individuals and on-base organizations, including deposits, account maintenance, and safekeeping. The [[Defense Finance and Accounting Service]] is the lead component for the Financial Services sector.
*'''Transportation''' - The Defense Transportation System, or DTS, includes resources that support global DoD transportation needs. These include surface, sea, and lift assets; supporting infrastructure; personnel; and related systems. [[United States Transportation Command|Transportation Command]], or USTRANSCOM, is the single manager for DoD transportation.
*'''Public Works''' - Public works includes four distinct physical infrastructure sectors: electric power, oil, and natural gas, water and sewer; and emergency services, such as fire, medical, and hazardous material handling.  This defense infrastructure sector is composed of networks and systems, principally for the distribution of the associated commodities.  The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] is responsible for coordinating the assurance activities of the public works infrastructure sector.
*'''Global Information Grid Command Control, or GIG/C2''' - The Global Information Grid Command Control, or GIG/C2, are two combined sectors that support overall asset assurance for CIP.  The GIG is the globally interconnected set of personnel, information, and communication capabilities necessary to achieve information superiority. C2 includes assets, facilities, networks, and systems that support mission accomplishment.  The [[Defense Information Systems Agency]], or DISA, is the lead component responsible for Global Information Grid Command Control.
*'''Intelligence Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, or ISR''' - The Defense Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance infrastructure sector is composed of facilities, networks, and systems that support ISR activities such as intelligence production and fusion centers.  The [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], or DIA, is responsible for coordinating the assurance activities of this infrastructure sector.
*'''Health Affairs''' - The health care infrastructure consists of facilities and sites worldwide. Some are located at DoD installations; however, DoD also manages a larger system of non-DoD care facilities within its health care network. These health care facilities are linked by information systems. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Heath Affairs is the designated lead component for this sector.
*'''Personnel''' - The defense personnel infrastructure sector includes a large number of assets hosted on component sites, a network of facilities, and information systems linking those sites and facilities. In addition to being responsible for its own assets, the personnel infrastructure sector also coordinates commercial services that support the personnel function. These services include recruitment, record keeping, and training. The [[Defense Human Resources Activity]] is the designated lead component for the Defense Personnel infrastructure sector.
*'''Space''' - The defense space infrastructure sector is composed of both space- and ground-based assets including launch, specialized logistics, and control systems. Facilities are located worldwide on both DoD-controlled and private sites. The Defense Space sector is led by the [[United States Strategic Command]], or USSTRATCOM.
*'''Logistics''' - The defense logistics sector includes all activities, facilities, networks, and systems that support the provision of supplies and services to U.S. forces worldwide.  Logistics includes the acquisition, storage, movement, distribution, and maintenance of material and supplies. This sector also includes the final disposition of material no longer needed by DoD. The [[Defense Logistics Agency]], or DLA, is the lead component for the DoD Logistics infrastructure.
*'''Defense Industrial Base''' - The [[Military industrial complex|Defense Industrial Base]] consists of DoD product and service providers from the private sector. The services and products provided constitute critical assets for DoD.  The lead component for the Defense Industrial Base is the [[Defense Contract Management Agency]].  For those cases when infrastructure protection requirements affect more than one defense sector, DoD has set up special function components that support the implementation of CIP.

===DoD special functions===
The DoD CIP special function components interface with the equivalent national functional coordinators and coordinate all activities related to their function within DoD.

DoD’s special function components currently include seven areas of focus.  They include the following components:

*'''Policy and Strategy''' - The Policy and Strategy Special Function Component provides the strategic planning required to prepare our Armed Forces for the 21st century. In part, it satisfies this responsibility through the development of the National Military Strategy.  Within the area of policy development it is responsible for leading the Chairman's biennial review of the Unified Command Plan and developing Joint Staff positions on such key issues as the organization, roles and missions, and functions of the Armed Forces and the combatant commands.
*'''Intelligence Support''' - The CIP Intelligence Support Special Function Component provides intelligence support to DoD in protection of the Defense portion of the Federal Government Critical Infrastructure. Intelligence Support responsibilities also include supporting the Defense Warning System, Alert and Notification, and interfacing with the national intelligence community.  The responsibilities of the Intelligence Support agencies include such activities as provisioning threat assessments; indications and warnings of potential attacks; advice and support to Sector CIAOs in the development of defense infrastructure sector monitoring and reporting; crisis management support; and counter-intelligence. This special function component is also tasked with the support to the DoD contingent of the NIPC related to intelligence and counter-intelligence.
*'''Industrial Policy''' - The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics ensures that an adequate defense industrial base exists and remains viable to meet current, future, and emergent national security requirements."
*'''Defense Security''' - The Defense Security Service provides to the Department of Defense and other Federal agencies an array of security products and services which are designed to deter and detect espionage
*'''Information Assurance''' - The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration, or ASD NII, is the principal OSD staff assistant for the development, oversight, and integration of DoD policies and programs relating to the strategy of information superiority for the Department of Defense. Information Assurance, or IA, is the component of Information Operations that assures DoD's operational readiness by providing for the continuous availability and reliability of information systems and networks. IA protects the DII against exploitation, degradation, and denial of service, while providing the means to efficiently reconstitute and reestablish vital capabilities following an attack.
*'''Research and Development''' - The Research and Development Special Function Component is responsible for information assurance and protection. The Office of Director, Defense Research and Engineering coordinates a CIP DoD research and development agenda. As well as reconciling the DoD agenda with the national R&amp;D agenda.
*'''Education and Awareness''' - Although education and awareness may rightly be considered everyone's responsibility, a comprehensive education and awareness strategy was deemed essential for a successful DoD CIP program. The National Defense University, or NDU, provided advice and assistance in assessing DoD education and awareness requirements. The Education and Awareness Component also developed the CIAO Education Program. This component was tasked to assist in the development of any special education or training required for CIP crisis management personnel.  Education and Awareness also supports both DoD and national CIP policy and strategy formulation and executive leadership development through periodic "infrastructure games".

==DoD CIP lifecycle==
As mandated by PDD-63, the DoD must protect its portion of the federal government's critical infrastructure. For DoD, this is the Defense Infrastructure or DI. Protecting the Defense Infrastructure is a complex task involving ten defense sectors.

It was deemed that it was nearly impossible to protect every critical asset at every location, therefore the focus was directed on protecting the critical Defense Infrastructure. The critical Defense Infrastructure is the critical assets essential to providing mission assurance.

[[Image:CIP-chart1.jpg|600px|center|The CIP Cycle (Chart 1)]]

===Six phases===
The six phases of the DoD CIP life cycle build on one another to create a framework for a comprehensive solution for infrastructure assurance.  The life cycle phases occur before, during, and after an event that may compromise or degrade the infrastructure.  A synopsis of the six phases are:

*'''Analysis and Assessment''' (occurs before an event) - The Analysis and Assessment phase is the foundation and most important phase of the CIP life cycle. This phase identifies the assets absolutely critical to mission success and determines the assets’ vulnerabilities, as well as their interdependencies,&lt;ref name="Critical Infrastructure Interdependency Wheel (CIIW) assessment tool"&gt;[http://www.tysonmacaulay.com/CIIW%20whitepaper%20US%20-%20July%2014%202008.pdf Critical Infrastructure Interdependency Wheel (CIIW) assessment tool] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717125417/http://www.tysonmacaulay.com/CIIW%20whitepaper%20US%20-%20July%2014%202008.pdf |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; configurations, and characteristics.  An assessment is then made of the operational impact of infrastructure loss or degradation. In addition, [[Proactive Cyber Defence]] may anticipate an attack against computers and networks.  It applies equally well to all critical infrastructure sectors, as it involves interdicting and disrupting an attack or a threat’s preparation to attack, either preemptively or in self-defense.
*'''Remediation''' (occurs before an event) - The Remediation phase involves precautionary measures and actions taken before an event occurs to fix the known cyber and physical vulnerabilities that could cause an outage or compromise a National Defense Infrastructure, or NDI, or critical asset.  For example, remediation actions may include education and awareness, operational process or procedural changes or system configuration and component changes.
*'''Indications and Warnings''' (occurs before and/or during an event) - The Indications and Warnings phase involves daily sector monitoring to assess the mission assurance capabilities of critical infrastructure assets and to determine if there are event indications to report.  Indications are preparatory actions that indicate whether an infrastructure event is likely to occur or is planned.  Indications are based on input at the tactical, operational, theater, and strategic level.  At the tactical level, input comes from asset owners. At the operational level, input comes from the NDI sectors.  At the theater level, input comes from regional assets such as allied intelligence, NATO, command intelligence, allied governments, and coalition forces.  At the strategic level, input comes from intelligence, law-enforcement, and the private sector.  Warning is the process of notifying asset owners of a possible threat or hazard.
*'''Mitigation''' (occurs both before and during an event) - The Mitigation phase comprises actions taken before or during an event in response to warnings or incidents. DoD Critical Asset owners, NDI sectors, DoD installations, and military operators take these actions to minimize the operational impact of a critical asset’s loss or debilitation.
*'''Incident Response''' (occurs after an event) - Incident Response comprises the plans and activities taken to eliminate the cause or source of an infrastructure event.
*'''Reconstitution''' (occurs after an event)  - The last phase of the CIP life cycle, involves actions taken to rebuild or restore a critical asset capability after it has been damaged or destroyed. This phase is the most challenging and least developed process.

Effective management of the CIP life cycle ensures that protection activities can be coordinated and reconciled among all DoD sectors. In many ways, DoD CIP, is risk management at its most imperative.  Achieving success means obtaining mission assurance. Missing the mark can mean mission failure as well as human and material losses. For critical infrastructure protection, risk management requires leveraging resources to address the most critical infrastructure assets that are also the most vulnerable and that have the greatest threat exposure.

The most important part of the CIP lifecycle is Phase 1.  Because it is crucial to target the right assets for infrastructure protection, determining these assets is the first phase in the CIP life cycle. This phase, Analysis and Assessment, is the key and foundation of the seven lifecycle activities.  Without a solid foundation, the remaining CIP life cycle phases may be flawed, resulting in a CIP plan that fails to protect the critical infrastructure and, therefore, mission assurance.

===Phase 1: Analysis and Assessment===
Phase 1 determines what assets are important, and identifies their vulnerabilities, and dependencies so that decision makers have the information they need to make effective risk management choices.

The Defense Infrastructure, or DI, is organized into ten sectors. Each sector is composed of assets, such as systems, programs, people, equipment, or facilities. Assets may be simple, such as one facility within one geographic location, or complex, involving geographically dispersed links and nodes.

The Analysis and Assessment is made up of five steps that include activities that span and encompass the ten DI sectors and their assets.

*I.  The first step in the Analysis and Assessment phase is to identify critical assets.  An asset’s criticality is a function of both time and situation based on the asset’s operational or business value. For the DI, value depends on several factors:  First, what military operations or services rely on an asset and how those dependencies change across time Next, how sensitive the operation is to the loss or compromise of the asset, in other words what is the maximum allowable down time if the asset is compromised. Finally, what the asset’s assurance profile is, in particular whether asset restoration or a switch to a backup can occur within the allowable down time. Through domain expertise and inspection, critical assets are identified and then reported to the CIP Program.
*II.  The second step of the Analysis and Assessment phase is Defense Infrastructure characterization. This step maps and associates critical asset functions and relationships within a DI sector.
*III.  The third step in the Analysis and Assessment phase is the Operational Impact Analysis. This step is accomplished through the development of operational dependency matrices and the application of operations research methods. Potential operational impacts and service-level requirements are then reflected in the asset’s criticality attributes and criticality index in the CIP program.
*IV.  The fourth step is the Vulnerability Assessment.  This step is accomplished through multiple channels.  Through the CIP program, all critical assets have a baseline vulnerability index, which is calculated from inputs associated with the class of asset and geographic region such as the probability of natural disasters, criminal or national security events, and technological failures.  Asset owners, host installations, the sector CIAO, or other DoD entities may provide asset operational readiness and emergency preparedness information.
*V.  The fifth and final step in the Analysis and Assessment phase is Interdependency Analysis. Interdependency analysis seeks to map functions and relationships among DI sectors.  As a result of the Interdependency Analysis, the criticality attributes for previously identified assets may be updated and additional critical assets may be identified to the CIP program.  Multiple groups within the DoD CIP structure perform analysis and assessment activities.  Translating the analysis and assessment process into concrete data requires specific activities, tasks, and tools.

==== Phase 1 Example in the “Real World” ====

On August 24, 2001, the Director of the Joint Staff requested USPACOM to serve as the lead support Combatant Command for creating a CIP first-ever theater CIP Plan – known as the “CIP Appendix 16 Plan”. The following is how USPACOM approached the task.
USPACOM focused the Analysis and Assessment phase by organizing its activities to answer three major questions:

*What is critical?
*Is it vulnerable?
*What can be done?
To answer the question, “What is critical?”, USPACOM outlined a three-step procedure:

*First, identify the project focus.
*Second, complete an operational analysis.
*Third, complete a Defense Infrastructure analysis.

To accomplish these steps, USPACOM adopted a methodology that focuses its CIP efforts on Tier&amp;nbsp;1 assets. Tier 1 assets are assets that could cause mission failure if they are compromised or damaged.  The methodology UAPACOM adopted and modified is Mission Area Analysis, or MAA.  The MAA links combatant command missions to infrastructure assets that are critical to a given Operations Plan, or OPLAN, Contingency Plan, or CONPLAN, or Crisis Action Plan. Typically, the MAA process determines the assessment site priorities.  USPACOM modified the process and selected the CIP assessment sites and installations prior to conducting the MAA.  The following is an illustration of the USPACOM MAA process:

*First, it identified the Mission Essential Requirements, or MERs, which are specific combatant commands or joint task force capabilities essential for execution of a warfighting plan. Then, they created an MER matrix for the specific command. For example, one MER may be to provide command, control, communications, and computers, or C4.
*Second, it identified forces required for each MER. For example, the C4 MER is linked to a specific signal battalion. Third, it linked the forces to the necessary functions and tasks supporting the force. For example, the signal battalion is linked to the Communications and Civil Engineers functions and the task of managing the theater’s C4 information systems requirements.
*Third, it links assets to the functions supporting the tasks. The result is a mission area analysis of mission-critical assets.
USPACOM uses the MAA data it gathers to scope and focus its efforts on truly mission-critical assets to answer the next question in its process, Is it vulnerable?

The first step in answering this question is to complete an installation analysis. The next step is to complete a commercial infrastructure analysis. USPACOM relied upon two different DoD organizations for CIP assessments: Balanced Survivability Assessments, or BSAs, and Mission Assurance Assessments.  The BSA is a two-week mission-focused assessment at a military installation or designated site.  A Mission Assurance Assessment is unique because it uses an area assessment approach to focus on both commercial and military asset vulnerabilities and dependencies.  The final step to determine vulnerabilities is to integrate the two analyses and assessments.  With its critical assets and their vulnerabilities identified, USPACOM is ready to perform risk management activities to decide what can be done to protect the [[mission-critical]] assets.

[[Booz Allen Hamilton]] developed this process at PACOM.

===Phase 2: Remediation===
The first phase of the CIP life cycle, Analysis and Assessment, identified the critical assets of DoD sector infrastructures and the vulnerabilities or weaknesses of those critical assets.

The second phase is the Remediation phase. In the Remediation phase, the known weaknesses and vulnerabilities are addressed. Remediation actions are deliberate, precautionary measures designed to fix known virtual and physical vulnerabilities before an event occurs. The purpose of remediation is to improve the reliability, availability, and survivability of critical assets and infrastructures.  Remediation actions apply to any type of vulnerability, regardless of its cause. They apply to acts of nature, technology failures, or deliberate malicious actions.

The cost of each remediation action depends on the nature of the vulnerability it addresses. The Defense Infrastructure Sector Assurance Plan that each infrastructure sector must develop, establishes the priorities and resources for remediation. Remediation requirements are determined by multiple factors. These are analysis and assessment, input from military planners and other DoD sectors, the National Infrastructure Assurance Plan and other plans, reports, and information on national infrastructure vulnerabilities and remediation, as well as intelligence estimates and assessments of threats.

Remediation requirements are also gathered through lessons learned from Defense Infrastructure sector monitoring and reporting and infrastructure protection operations and exercises.  The CIP program tracks the status of remediation activities for critical assets. Remediation activities to protect the critical Defense Infrastructure cross multiple Department components.

===Phase 3:  Indications and Warnings===
The need to monitor activities and warn of potential threats to the United States is not new. From conventional assaults to potential nuclear attacks, the military has been at the forefront of monitoring and warning of potential dangers since the founding of the country.  Protecting the security and well being of the United States, including the critical Defense Infrastructure, has now entered a new era. It has been deemed essential to have a coordinated ability to identify and warn of potential or actual incidents among critical infrastructure domains. The ability to detect and warn of infrastructure events is the third phase of the critical infrastructure protection life cycle, the Indications and Warnings phase.

Indications and warnings are actions or infrastructure conditions that signal an event is either”

*Likely,
*Planned or
*Underway.

Historically, DoD event indications have focused and relied on intelligence information about foreign developments.  These event indications have been expanded to include all potential infrastructure disruption or degradation, regardless of its cause.  DoD CIP indications are based on four levels of input:

*Tactical level input from DoD asset owners or installations
*Operational-level input from sector Chief Information Assurance Officers (CIAOs)
*Theater-level input from command and service intelligence and counter-intelligence activities.
*Strategic-level intelligence from the intelligence community, law enforcement, and the private sector

This fusion of traditional intelligence information with sector-specific information has been determined to be essential for meaningful CIP indications.

If an indication is detected, a warning notifying the appropriate asset owners of a possible or occurring event or hazard can be issued.  The sector’s assurance plan determines what conditions and actions are monitored and reported for each Defense Infrastructure Sector. Each sector must develop a written Defense Sector Assurance Plan that includes a compendium of sector incidents for monitoring and reporting. The sector incident compendium is made up of three types of incidents:

*Nationally defined reportable incidents
*DoD defined reportable incidents, and
*Sector-defined reportable incidents.

DoD critical asset owners, installations, and sector CIAOs determine the DoD and sector-defined incidents.  Each of the reportable incidents or classes of incidents must include the following components:

*Who should monitor the incident
*How soon the incident must be reported
*Which information elements the incident should contain
*How the incident reporting should be routed
*What follow-up actions are required

The National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) is the primary national warning center for significant infrastructure attacks.  Critical asset owners, DoD installations, and Sector CIAOs monitor the infrastructure daily. Indications of an infrastructure incident are reported to the National Military Command Center, or NMCC.  If indications are on a computer network, they are also reported to the Joint Task Force Computer Network Operations (JTF-CNO).  The NMCC and JTF-CNO assess the indications and pass them to the NIPC and appropriate DoD organizations.  When the NIPC determines that an infrastructure event is likely to occur, is planned, or is under way, it issues a national warning. For DoD, the NIPC passes its warnings and alerts to the NMCC and JTF-CNO.  These warnings and alerts are then passed to the DoD components. The warning may include guidance regarding additional protection measures DoD should take.

===Phase 4:  Mitigation===
Phase 1 of the CIP life cycle provided a layer of protection by identifying and assessing critical assets and their vulnerabilities. Phase&amp;nbsp;2 provided another layer of protection by remediating or improving the identified deficiencies and weaknesses of an asset.  Even with these protections and precautions, an infrastructure incident was still possible. When it does the Indications and Warnings phase goes into effect.

The Mitigation phase (Phase 4), is made up of preplanned coordinated actions in response to infrastructure warnings or incidents. Mitigation actions are taken before or during an infrastructure event. These actions are designed to minimize the operational impact of the loss of a critical asset, facilitate incident response, and quickly restore the infrastructure service.

A primary purpose of the Mitigation phase is to minimize the operational impact on other critical Defense Infrastructures and assets when a critical asset is lost or damaged. As an example, if there is a U.S. installation, Site&amp;nbsp;A, located in a host nation. Site&amp;nbsp;A is a tier&amp;nbsp;1 asset, meaning that if it fails, the Combatant Commands mission fails.  Site&amp;nbsp;A has mutual Global Information Grid Command Control (GIG/C2), information interdependencies with Sites&amp;nbsp;B and C.  In addition, other Defense Infrastructure sectors rely on Site&amp;nbsp;A for mission capabilities.  In this scenario, what could be the impact if the supply line to the commercial power plant that provides the installation’s primary power is accidentally severed.  Because of all the interdependencies, losing this asset is more than the loss of just one site. It means the loss of other sector capabilities.

A possible mitigation action might be for Site&amp;nbsp;A to go on backup power.
An alternate action could be to pass complete control of Site A’s functionality to another site, where redundancy has been previously arranged.  These actions would limit the impact of this incident on the other sites and related sectors.  In addition to lessening the operational impact of a critical infrastructure event, the Mitigation phase of the CIP life cycle supports and complements two other life cycle phases. Mitigation actions aid in the emergency, investigation, and management activities of Phase&amp;nbsp;5, Incident Response. They also facilitate the reconstitution activities of Phase 6.

During the Mitigation phase, DoD critical asset owners, DoD installations, and Sector Chief Infrastructure Assurance Officers, or CIAOs, work with the National Military Command Center (NMCC) and the Joint Task Force-Computer Network Operations (JTF-CNO) to develop, train for, and exercise mitigation responses for various scenarios.  When there is a warning, emergency, or infrastructure incident, the critical asset owners, installations, and Sector CIAOs initiate mitigation actions to sustain service to the DoD. They also provide mitigation status information to the NMCC and JTF-CNO. The NMCC monitors for consequences from an event within one Defense Infrastructure sector that are significant enough to affect other sectors. For events that cross two or more sectors, the NMCC advises on the prioritization and coordination of mitigation actions. When event threats or consequences continue to escalate, the NMCC directs mitigation actions by sector to ensure a coordinated response across the DoD. The NMCC and the JTF-CNO keep the National Infrastructure Protection Center, or NIPC, apprised of any significant mitigation activities.

===Phase 5:  Incident response===
When an event affects the Defense Infrastructure, the Incident Response phase begins. Incident Response is the fifth phase of the CIP life cycle.  The purpose of the Incident Response phase is to eliminate the cause or source of an infrastructure event. For example, during the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, all non-military airplanes were grounded over the United States to prevent further incidents.  Response activities included emergency measures, not from the asset owners or operators, but from dedicated third parties such as law enforcement, medical rescue, fire rescue, hazardous material or explosives handling, and investigative agencies.  Response to Defense Infrastructure incidents can take one of two paths depending on whether or not the event affects a DoD computer network.

When incidents compromise a DoD computer network, the Joint Task Force-Computer Network Operations (JTF-CNO) directs the response activities. These activities are designed to stop the computer network attack, contain and mitigate damage to a DoD information network and then restore minimum required functionality.  JTF-CNO also requests and coordinates any support or assistance from other Federal agencies and civilian organizations during incidents affecting a DoD network.  When incidents impact any other DoD owned assets, installation commanders and critical asset owners follow traditional channels and procedures to coordinate responses. This includes notifying affected Sector Chief Infrastructure Assurance Officers, or CIAOs, in the initial notice and status reporting.  Although third parties play a major role in the response to Defense Infrastructure events, DoD CIP personnel also have responsibilities to fulfill.

===Phase 6:  Reconstitution===
After the source or cause of an infrastructure event is eliminated or contained, the infrastructure and its capabilities must be restored.  Reconstitution is the last phase of the critical infrastructure protection. Reconstitution is probably the most challenging and least developed process of the life cycle. DoD critical asset owners have the major responsibility for reconstitution.

==History==
In 1965–1966, Sukarno still enjoyed the Indonesian people's sympathy, but for Suharto to take that place, he had to downplay Sukarno's importance to the Indonesians.&lt;ref name=Merdeka2013&gt;{{cite web |title=De-Soekarnoisasi, Soeharto 'bunuh' Bung Karno di hati rakyat |first=Hery H |last=Winarno |website=merdeka.com |date=21 June 2013 |language=id |url=https://www.merdeka.com/peristiwa/de-soekarnoisasi-soeharto-bunuh-bung-karno-di-hati-rakyat.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The de-Sukarnoization process started in 1967&lt;ref name=Kusuma2011/&gt; after the Provisional [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (MPRS) stripped Sukarno of his presidential powers and put him under [[house arrest]]. While in custody, Sukarno was denied access to [[health care]], which led to his death in 1970. Suharto denied Sukarno's request to be buried in Istana Batu Tulis in [[Bogor]]; instead, Sukarno was buried in [[Blitar]], a city then-government said as his birthplace. Suharto is said to have feared that if his predecessor's grave had been located in Bogor it could become a focal point for fomenting opposition to his [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Feith |first=Herbert |date=October 1968 |title=Suharto's Search for a Political Format |jstor=3350713 |journal=Indonesia |issue=6 |pages=88–105 |doi=10.2307/3350713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Order renamed many places that had been named after Sukarno: [[Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex]] was replaced by "Senayan Sports Complex", the city "Sukarnopura" (Sukarno City) was changed to "[[Jayapura]]" and "Puncak Sukarno" (Sukarno Peak) to "[[Puncak Jaya]]".&lt;ref name=Merdeka2013/&gt;

Other efforts to reduce Sukarno's influence included denying his major contribution in creating the Indonesian national ideology, ''[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]]''. The New Order's historian, [[Nugroho Notosusanto]], instead posed that [[Mohammad Yamin]] came up first with the principles of ''Pancasila'', while Sukarno was merely the first to use the term. This interpretation was supported by the New Order government and became the official historical interpretation taught at schools.&lt;ref name=Kusuma2011/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2907">The '''Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women''' is a [[human rights]] proclamation issued by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], outlining that body's views on [[women's rights]].  It was adopted by the General Assembly on 7 November 1967.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2263, 7 November, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Declaration was an important precursor to the legally binding 1979 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]].

==Summary==

The Declaration follows the structure of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], with a preamble followed by eleven articles.

'''Article 1''' declares that discrimination against women is "fundamentally unjust and constitutes an offence against human dignity".&lt;ref&gt;Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, Article 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Discrimination" is not defined.

'''Article 2''' calls for the abolition of laws and customs which discriminate against women, for equality under the law to be recognised, and for states to ratify and implement existing UN human rights instruments against discrimination.

'''Article 3''' calls for public education to eliminate [[prejudice]] against women.

'''Article 4''' calls for women to enjoy full electoral rights, including the right to vote and the right to seek and hold public office.

'''Article 5''' calls for women to have the same rights as men to change their [[nationality]].

'''Article 6''' calls for women to enjoy full equality in [[Civil law (area)|civil law]], particularly around marriage and [[divorce]], and calls for child marriages tobe outlawed.

'''Article 7''' calls for the elimination of gender discrimination in criminal punishment.

'''Article 8''' calls on states to combat all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of [[prostitution]] of women.

'''Article 9''' affirms an equal [[right to education]] regardless of gender.

'''Article 10''' calls for equal rights in the workplace, including non-discrimination in employment, [[equal pay for equal work]], and paid [[maternity leave]].

'''Article 11''' calls on states to implement the principles of the Declaration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2075">'''Don Orlich''' is professor emeritus of the Science Mathematics Engineering Education Center at [[Washington State University]]. He has published more than 100 professional papers, co-authored more than 30 monographs and books, and is the senior co-author of “Teaching Strategies: A guide to Effective Teaching,” published by Houghton Mifflin in 2004. 

He has conducted an independent study of Washington's [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning|WASL]] [[standards based assessment]], concluding, “The WASL is a disaster” Orlich has concluded that the fifth grade science WASL exceeds the intellectual level of the majority of fifth graders, the seventh grade math WASL is more like a ninth grade test. Learning goals for the seventh grade is almost identical to many 10th grade goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grumpyconsumer.com/071906%20education.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104071807/http://www.grumpyconsumer.com/071906%20education.pdf |archivedate=2006-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has authored a soon to be released book titled “School Reform and the Great American Brain Robbery,”. He analyzed areas of the WASL using criteria from developmental psychology and the Scales of the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP). Orlich has found areas of the Grade Level Expectations (GLEs), hence the WASL test, to be developmentally inappropriate. He has won a national award from the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development for a critical analysis he wrote on the fourth-grade WASL, although the OSPI disagrees with the analysis.

'''Families Need Fathers''' ('''FNF'''), founded in 1974, is a registered charitable organization in the United Kingdom that provides public awareness and support to parents who have become estranged from their children after a separation or divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=276899&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 |publisher=Charity Commission |title=Families Need Fathers Limited |date=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
__TOC__

== Background ==
Families Need Fathers was founded in May 1974 by child psychiatrist Alick Elithorn and financial consultant Keith Parkin as an organization to campaign for equal parenting rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.familylaw.co.uk/articles/interview-with-jon-davies-outgoing-ceo-of-families-need-fathers-8652#articles |publisher=familylaw.co.uk |title=Interview with Jon Davies, outgoing CEO of Families Need Fathers |date=30 July 2010 |first=Hugh |last=Logue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New Humanist]]'' magazine argued in a 2007 article that at its foundation FNF cast itself outside the frame of respectability as they were said to advocate for the [[kidnapping]] of children whose [[child custody|custody]] was awarded to their mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Murray |first=Jenni |author-link=Jenni Murray |date=31 May 2007 |title=Happy Fathers' Day |url=https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/728/happy-fathers-day |magazine=[[New Humanist]] |location=London |publisher=[[Rationalist Association]] |access-date=23 October 2017 |quote=Families Need Fathers, set up in the seventies, advocated the abduction of children awarded to mothers in custody cases and ruled themselves out of the frame of respectability.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FNF became a registered charity in 1979, and now has more than 50 branches across the United Kingdom and continues to advocate shared parenting with the Media, House of Commons and the Family Justice Establishment while continuing its work as a social care organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/13/fathers-rights-overlooked-law-welcome |newspaper=The Guardian | title=Fathers finally get equal access rights&amp;nbsp;... |date=13 June 2012 |first=Jack |last=O'Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed89133 |work=Family Law Week |title=Professional groups welcome the key proposals of the Family Justice Review |date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/real-life/2011/03/22/dads-made-to-feel-part-of-the-family-91466-28377803/#ixzz25HRLr000 |newspaper=South Wales Echo |title=Dads made to feel part of the family |date=14 June 2011 |first=Cathy |last=Owen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the work of the charity has been in providing relief, assistance, guidance and support to parents and other close family members hoping to stay in touch with their children after divorce or separation. It aims to further the emotional development of children whose parents have separated by encouraging shared parenting arrangements which enable such children to have continuing and meaningful relationships with both parents. They seek to study problems associated with children who are deprived of a parent and to promote good relationships between parents living apart from their children and to promote understanding of this amongst family and legal professionals and policy makers.

In 2008 FNF ran projects under the umbrella of "Both Parents Matter" and this strapline was added to the charity's logo in 2013 to clearly articulate the emphasis the charity placed on the importance of both parents in a child's life.

== Focus ==
FNF is chiefly concerned with the problems of maintaining a child's relationship with both parents during and after family breakdown. The charity cites a study that shows roughly a third of all children from separated parents have no contact with their fathers in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/relationships/divorce/6575997/Third-of-family-break-up-children-lose-contact-with-fathers-in-failing-court-system-poll.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |title=Third of family break-up children lose contact with fathers in ‘failing’ court system, poll |date=16 November 2009 |first=John |last=Bingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Families Need Fathers receives around 25,000 calls to its Helpline, receives around 5,000 visitors to local meetings, a similar number of posts to its online Forum and 185,000 unique page views to its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fnf.org.uk/component/phocadownload/file/217-fnf-accounts-and-annual-report-2015-16|title=Families Need Fathers - Families Need Fathers - FNF Accounts and Annual Report 2015-16|website=fnf.org.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

is a separately registered charity that was set up to respond to changes affecting parents going through separation that may result from Welsh devolution.&lt;ref name="Emigrated"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/2010/01/01/north-wales-dad-emigrated-to-fight-for-children-55578-25503812/ |newspaper=Daily Post |title=South African starts support group |date=1 January 2010 |first=Andrew |last=Gilipin}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wales has (CAFCASS) Cymru,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wales.gov.uk/cafcasscymru/home/?lang=en |publisher=.gov.uk |title=(CAFCASS) Cymru}}&lt;/ref&gt; while England has [[Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service|(CAFCASS)]].

The National Manager of the charity is Paul Apreda who amongst other things coordinates support meetings across Wales and seeks to develop the infrastructure of the charity to provide assistance to increasing numbers of people.

In 2011 FNFBPM Cymru ran a competition in South Wales looking for a "superdad", with a £500 prize for the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Super+dads%3B+Parent+charity+Families+Need+Fathers+is+looking+for+South...-a0258797818 |title=Families Need Fathers is looking for South Wales' Superdad 2011 |publisher=The Free Library |newspaper=South Wales Echo |date=14 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/south-wales-news/pontypridd-llantrisant/2011/06/16/superdad-nominee-stephen-is-already-a-winner-at-home-91466-28878322/ |newspaper=Pontypridd Observer |title=Superdad nominee Stephen is already a winner at home |date=16 June 2011 |first=Cathy |last=Owen}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed the next year by the "Inspirational Wales Dad of the Year Award" at Ty Hywel in Cardiff Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/2012/06/15/flintshire-father-wins-inspirational-dad-of-the-year-award-55578-31187485/ |newspaper=Daily Post |title=Flintshire father wins ‘Inspirational Dad of the Year’ award |date=15 June 2012 |first=Kate |last=Forrester }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br/&gt; In 2013 the Charity held a Dinner to celebrate fathers with Louis de Bernieres as the guest speaker. In the last year, the Charity has hosted lectures on Parental Alienation with Karen Woodall one of the world experts in the subject in Cardiff and in Llandudno Junction for professionals working in the family law arena to attend.&lt;br/&gt; Following funding from Cardiff City Council the charity has produced a booklet "A guide for school professionals... working with fathers and other non resident parents" &lt;br/&gt; There are support groups that meet once a month in Cardiff, Aberystwyth, Bangor, Blackwood, Bridgend, Merthyr, Newport, Swansea and Wrexham. A new group is due to start in St Clares this year. In Cardiff there is also a once monthly emotional support group led by a professional counselor. It also provides a telephone helpline and emotional support for parents and other family members dealing with issues relating to separation from their children.

Support meetings include a wide range of people - not just fathers. Increasingly (and thought by some as a result to the changes in Legal Aid eligibility) volunteers are supporting grandparents and mothers (both resident and non resident) who are seeking assistance in dealing with emotional and legal support.

'''Ferdinand Lee Barnett''' (February 18, 1852 – March 11, 1936) was an African-American journalist, lawyer, and civil rights activist in [[Chicago, Illinois]] in the late Reconstruction era and after. He was a founding editor of ''[[The Chicago Conservator]]'' monthly in 1878. He was the third black person to be admitted to the Illinois bar and became a successful lawyer.

In 1895, he married [[Ida B. Wells]], a journalist and anti-lynching activist. In 1896, he became Illinois' first black assistant state's attorney. He was active in anti-lynching and civil rights and was called "one of the foremost citizens Chicago has ever had" by the ''[[Chicago Defender]]''.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"&gt;Finkelman, Paul, ed. ''Encyclopedia of African American History, 1896 to the Present: From the Age of Segregation to the Twenty-first Century''. Oxford University Press, 2009. pp. 137&amp;ndash;138&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Ferdinand Lee Barnett was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1852.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; His mother was a freewoman,&lt;ref name="judgeship"&gt;Negro Elected to Judgeship, ''San Francisco Chronicle'' (San Francisco, California) December 17, 1906, page 3, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653448//&lt;/ref&gt; Martha Brooks, born about 1825. His father, also named Ferdinand Lee Barnett, was born in Nashville about 1810 and worked as a blacksmith. He purchased his family's freedom the year Ferdinand was born. They lived in Nashville until about 1859, when they left the United States and moved to [[Windsor, Ontario]], across the Detroit River from Detroit, Michigan.&lt;ref name="goldenwedding"&gt;Golden Wedding of Colored Couple, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'' (Chicago, Illinois), June 28, 1897, p. 5, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://web.archive.org/web/20170917080536/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653492/golden_wedding_of_colored_couple/&lt;/ref&gt; They wanted to get beyond the reach of the [[Fugitive Slave Act]] of 1850, which had created incentives for slave catchers to kidnap free blacks and sell them into slavery.

The Barnett family returned to the US in 1869 after the American Civil War and the end of slavery, settling in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Ferdinand was educated in Chicago schools,&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; first attending the old Jones school at Clark and Harrison. He entered [[Chicago High School|Central High School]],&lt;ref name="judgeship"/&gt; graduating in 1874. After high school he taught in the southern United States for two years before returning to Chicago to attend Union College of Law, later a part of [[Northwestern Law School]]. Barnett graduated from law school and was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1878.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; He was the third black person to pass the Illinois bar, following [[Lloyd G. Wheeler]] and Richard A. Dawson.&lt;ref&gt;McCaul, Robert L. ''The Black Struggle for Public Schooling in Nineteenth-Century Illinois''. SIU Press, 2009. p100-101&lt;/ref&gt;

Numbered among his cousins were [[Ferdinand L. Barnett (Omaha)|Ferdinand L. Barnett]] and his brother [[Alfred S. Barnett]].

== ''Conservator'' and early activism ==
In December 1877, Barnett, along with co-editors Abram T. Hall, Jr. and James E. Henderson, organized the semi-monthly newspaper, the ''Conservator'', the first edition appearing on January 1, 1878.&lt;ref&gt;[No Headline] ''Chicago Daily Tribune'' (Chicago, Illinois) December 10, 1877, page 9, accessed September 15, 2016 at https://web.archive.org/web/20170917123353/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6645582/no_headline_chicago_daily_tribune/&lt;/ref&gt; Also among the editors and stakeholders was Iowan [[Alexander Clark]].&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. ''Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising.'' GM Rewell &amp; Company, 1887. p1100&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to Chicago in 1884, where he served as an editor on the paper. (Clark was appointed as US ambassador to Liberia in 1891.)&lt;ref name="pioneer"&gt;[http://muscatinejournal.com/news/local/black-history-pioneer-alexander-clark-became-prominent-achiever-while-residing/article_66625acb-5714-519f-b6ee-96a031c5af75.html Connie Street, "Black history pioneer: Alexander Clark became prominent achiever while residing in Muscatine"], ''Muscatine Journal'', 24 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Conservator'' was a radical journal that focused on justice and equal rights, and Barnett was soon recognized as a local black leader. He was selected as a delegate to the [[Colored Conventions Movement|May 1879 National Conference of Colored Men]] in Nashville, where he gave a noted speech calling for unity and education.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; He was a delegate to the 1884 Inter-State Conference of Colored Men in [[Pittsburgh]],&lt;ref&gt;The Colored Men, ''Detroit Free Press'' (Detroit, Michigan), April 30, 1884, page 2, accessed September 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6645642/the_colored_men_detroit_free_press/&lt;/ref&gt; and the national convention of the [[Timothy Thomas Fortune]] led [[National Afro-American League|Afro-American League]] in Chicago in 1890 where he was named secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Afro-Americans, ''The Ottawa Daily Republic'' (Ottawa, Kansas) January 16, 1890, page 1, accessed September 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6645673/afroamericans_the_ottawa_daily/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal and political career ==
Barnett started practicing law around 1883.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; His prominence grew quickly and in 1888 he was considered for a Republican nomination for [[Cook County Board of Commissioners|Cook County Commissioner]].&lt;ref&gt;[No Headline], ''The Inter Ocean'' (Chicago, Illinois), September 12, 1888, page 4, accessed September 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6645703/no_headline_the_inter_ocean/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892, he started a law partnership with [[S. Laing Williams]]. The pair split over Williams' affiliation with [[Booker T. Washington]], whom Barnett frequently opposed.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt;

=== Ida B. Wells ===
[[File:Cover Southern horrors.png|thumb|upright|Cover of ''Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases'']]
In 1892, three men, including a friend of Ida B. Wells, were [[lynching|lynched]] by a white mob while in police custody in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], in an event known as the [[Peoples Grocery|Peoples Grocery lynching]]. The act sparked a national outcry and Barnett took part in meetings in Chicago called to organize reaction. At a meeting of one thousand people at Bethel A. M. E. Church, Reverend W. Gaines' call for the crowd to sing the then ''de facto'' national anthem, "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]", but the call was refused, one member of the audience declaring, "I don't want to sing that song until this country is what it claims to be, 'sweet land of liberty'".&lt;ref name=sing/&gt; Gaines substituted the Civil War-era song about the abolitionist martyr, "[[John Brown's Body]]". Barnett closed the meeting appealing for calm and a careful response, but also expressing great frustration and concern that the violence against blacks may one day lead to reprisals.&lt;ref name=sing&gt;Wouldn't Sing America," ''The Evening World'' (New York, New York) March 28, 1892, page 3, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6654115/wouldnt_sing_america_the_evening/, Not Their Country, ''The Decatur Herald'' (Decatur, Illinois) March 29, 1892, page 1, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6657652/not_their_country_the_decatur_herald/&lt;/ref&gt;

The event inspired Wells, who began to research and speak out against lynchings. In 1893, Wells sued the ''[[The Commercial Appeal|Memphis Commercial]]'' for libel when the journal attacked Wells over her reports on the racism and injustice of lynching. It had been claimed that lynching, while not legal, was a natural result of the need for revenge of a community against perpetrators of violent crime and did not single out blacks. Wells' work showed the falseness of this narrative. Wells asked lawyer and activist [[Albion W. Tourgee]] to represent her on the case, but Tourgee refused, having largely retired from law (with the exception of his ongoing support of the case which would become [[Plessy v Fergusson]]). Tourgee recommended Wells contact Barnett, and Barnett agreed to take the case. This may have been Barnett's introduction to Wells, whom he would marry two years later, and Barnett was taken with Wells. However, Barnett came to agree with the advice of Tourgee that the case could not be won, as a black woman would never win such a case heard by a white, male jury, and the case was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Karcher, Carolyn L. ''A Refugee from His Race: Albion W. Tourgée and His Fight Against White Supremacy''. UNC Press Books, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World's Fair ===
In 1893, Barnett coauthored a pamphlet entitled "The Reason Why the Colored American is not in the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] – The Afro-American's Contribution to Columbian Literature". The exposition, held in Chicago, refused to include an African American exhibit. The pamphlet was another early example of Barnett's personal and professional relationship with Wells.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; The pamphlet was published by Barnett, Wells, abolitionist [[Frederick Douglass]], and educator [[Irvine Garland Penn]]. The exhibition included a number of exhibits put on by individuals and approved by white organizers of the fair, including exhibits by the sculptor [[Edmonia Lewis]], a painting exhibit by scientist [[George Washington Carver]], and a statistical exhibit by [[John Imogen Howard]]. It also included blacks in white exhibits, such as [[Nancy Green]]'s portrayal of the character, "Aunt Jemima" for the R. T. Davis Milling Company.&lt;ref&gt;See introduction of 2013 edition of Rydell, Robert W. ''All the world's a fair: Visions of empire at American international expositions, 1876–1916''. University of Chicago Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriages and family ==
[[File:Ida Wells-Ferdinand Barnett and family.png|thumb|Photo of the Wells-Barnett Family from 1917&lt;ref name="hometies"/&gt;]]
Barnett's first wife was Molly Henrietta Graham Barnett, who was the first black woman to graduate from the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Bay2009"&gt;Bay, Mia. ''To Tell the Truth Freely: The Life of Ida B. Wells''. Macmillan, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Molly and Ferdinand had two children, Ferdinand L. and Albert Graham Barnett. Molly died in 1888&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; of heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;Bradwell, James B, "The Colored Bar of Chicago," ''Chicago Legal News'' (Chicago, Illinois), Vol XXIX, No. 10, October 31, 1896&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Ferdinand Barnett served as [[370th Infantry Regiment (United States)|Eighth Regiment]] supply sergeant in World War I.&lt;ref name="hometies"&gt;"Breaking Home Ties", ''The Broad Ax'' (Salt Lake City, Utah) December 22, 1917, p. 14, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653602/breaking_home_ties_the_broad_ax_salt/&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Barnett became the city editor of the ''Defender'' in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[No Headline], ''The Pittsburgh Courier'' (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), December 3, 1932, page 17, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653821/no_headline_the_pittsburgh_courier/&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells remained in Chicago after the [[Columbian Exposition]]. In June 1895, she and Barnett married. The couple had four children, Charles Aked (1896), Herman Kohlsaat (1897), Ida B. (1901) and Alfreda M. Barnett (1904). Charles was named for the English anti-lynching activist, [[Charles Aked]], and Herman was named for the owner of the ''Chicago Inter Ocean'', [[H. H. Kohlsaat|Herman Kohlsaat]], who supported the ''Conservator''.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; Barnett's attraction to Wells included his recognition of the mutual support for each other's careers that the relationship would bring. Shortly before their marriage, Wells purchased Barnett's stake in the ''Conservator'' and became the paper's manager and co-editor, while Barnett focused on his legal career.&lt;ref name="Bay2009"/&gt; Reverend [[Richard DeBaptiste]], founder of Olivet Baptist Church, was co-editor after Barnett.&lt;ref&gt;Dolinar, Brian, ed. ''The Negro in Illinois: The WPA Papers''. University of Illinois Press, 2013. p113&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later career ==
[[File:20070601 Wells House (2).JPG|thumb|left|From 1919–1930, Barnett and Wells lived in the [[Ida B. Wells-Barnett House]], now a [[List of Chicago Landmarks|Chicago landmark]] and [[National Historic Landmark]]]]
Barnett was an active Republican, and his support for the party put him in line for public office. In 1896, he was put in charge of the bureau of information and education for blacks by the [[Republican National Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;"Allison Says Iowa is Safe", ''The New York Times'' (New York, New York) August 18, 1896, page 3, accessed September, 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6645724/allison_says_iowa_is_safe_the_new_york/&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1896, Barnett became the first black assistant state's attorney in Illinois, appointed by the state's attorney [[Charles S. Deneen]] upon the recommendation of the Cook County Commissioner [[Edward H. Wright]].&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; As assistant state's attorney, Barnett worked in the juvenile court, in antitrust cases, and in [[habeas corpus]] and extradition proceedings. He frequently appeared before the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] and had a good record.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; In 1902, Barnett made national news when he suggested that 10 million blacks would revolt against lynch law in the South at a gathering at Bethlehem Church in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;"Colored Race's Rights", ''Deseret Evening News'' (Salt Lake City, Utah) May 23, 1902, page 3, accessed September 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6645931/colored_races_rights_deseret_evening/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 he was appointed as head of the Chicago branch of the Republican Party's Negro Bureau. This appointment was opposed by [[Booker T. Washington]], who preferred Barnett's former partner, S. Laing Williams.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt;

=== Municipal court judgeship controversy ===
In 1906, Barnett was nominated as judge in the new municipal court in Chicago, the first black candidate for a judgeship in Illinois. Barnett lost the election by 304 votes due to a lack of support by white&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; and black Republicans. In the campaign for the position, Barnett did not gain the full support of black ministers, particularly [[Archibald J. Cary]]. They were angry that his wife Ida B. Wells supported gambling kingpin Bob Motts's Peking Theater – which was converted from a saloon. Barnett was initially declared winner, but the results were reviewed and Barnett became the only one of 27 Republican candidates rejected.&lt;ref name="Reed2014"&gt;Reed, Christopher Robert. ''Knock at the Door of Opportunity: Black Migration to Chicago, 1900–1919''. SIU Press, 2014. p191, 289&lt;/ref&gt; If he had been elected, Barnett would have been the second black judge in a court of record after [[Robert Heberton Terrell]] of Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="judgeship"/&gt;

=== Return to private practice and death ===
[[File:FL Barnett 1918.png|thumb|Photo of Barnett from ''The Broad Ax'' in 1918&lt;ref name="chickenjoe"&gt;Chicken Joe Campbell will not Hand for Governor Frank O Lowden has Commuted his Death Sentence to Life Imprisonment, ''The Broad Ax'' (Salt Lake City, Utah) April 13, 1918, page 3, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653572//&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Barnett left the position of assistant state's attorney in 1910, turning to private practice where he advocated for African-American rights. He often worked ''pro bono'', focusing on employment discrimination and criminal cases.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; In 1917 he was a candidate for [[Chicago City Council|alderman]] of the second ward in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Barnett, "Candidate for Alderman", ''The Broad Ax'' (Salt Lake City, Utah) February 24, 1917, page 4, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653894//&lt;/ref&gt; His most famous case was the defense with attorneys [[Robert M. McMurdy]] and Cowen of "Chicken Joe" Campbell. Although Campbell was convicted for the murder of Odelle B. Allen, his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by Governor [[Frank O. Lowden]] on April 12, 1918.&lt;ref name="chickenjoe"/&gt;

in the 1920s, Barnett and his wife supported [[Marcus Garvey]] and the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]].&lt;ref name="Reed2014"/&gt; In the 1920s and 1930s, Barnett began to support the Democratic Party.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt;

Barnett died March 11, 1936.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt;

The '''genetics and abortion''' issue is an extension of the [[abortion debate]] and the [[disability rights movement]]. Since the advent of forms of [[prenatal diagnosis]], such as [[amniocentesis]] and [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]], it has become possible to detect the presence of [[congenital disorder]]s in the [[fetus]] before [[birth]]. Specifically, disability-selective abortion is the [[abortion]] of fetuses that are found to have non-fatal mental or physical defects detected through [[prenatal testing]].&lt;ref name=LAWSON&gt;Lawson, K. (2006). Expectations of the parenting experience and willingness to consider selective termination for Down Syndrome. ''Journal of Reproductive and Infant Psychology'', 24(1), 43-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Many prenatal tests are now considered routine, such as testing for Down syndrome. Women who are discovered to be carrying fetuses with disabilities are often faced with the decision of whether to abort or to prepare to parent a child with disabilities.&lt;ref name="LAWSON" /&gt;

==Legality of selective abortion==
{{further|Abortion law}}
In many countries abortion is available upon request up to a certain point in the pregnancy, not taking into account why the mother wants the abortion, but in a small number of countries all abortions are prohibited, including for those pregnancies that risk the mother's life, including Vatican City, El Savador, Chile and Malta. Countries may also restrict abortion even if the child has a [[Genetic disorder|genetic defect]]. Countries that allow abortion if the mother is at risk but do not allow abortion if the child has a genetic defect include Iran, Ireland, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Not all genetic markers which can be checked are for disease, leaving open the possibility that parents may choose an abortion based on personal preference rather than avoidance of disease. In some jurisdictions, [[Sex-selective abortion and infanticide|sex-selective abortion]] is specifically prohibited. Many [[pro-life]] activists are concerned that genetic testing will give women excuses to get abortions. It is believed that eventually genetic testing will be able to provide a wealth of knowledge on the future health of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams |first=Stephen |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9315265/Unborn-babies-could-be-tested-for-3500-genetic-faults.html |title=Unborn babies could be tested for 3,500 genetic faults |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic testing for Down syndrome==
Today screening for [[Down syndrome]] is offered as a routine part of parental care. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends offering various screening tests for Down syndrome to all pregnant women, regardless of age. Genetic testing however, is not completely accurate but it can help to determine if further tested should be administered or if there should be concern. Testing for Down Syndrome can be conducted at different times of the pregnancy. Most women chose the first trimester choice which is done in two parts at the 11th and 13th week of pregnancy. These tests include an ultrasound to measure a certain area on the back of the baby's neck. If there is a problem with the baby than there will be an excess of fluid in this area. The second part of the test is a blood test which looks for abnormal levels of PAPP-A and HCG which may indicate a problem with the baby. Of all women who test for Down Syndrome only 5 percent are identified as being at risk. Of those 5 percent far fewer are actually carrying children with Down Syndrome. Screening tests are actually better for testing what women are at risk compared to how many women are actually carrying children with Down Syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/down-syndrome/DS00182/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis |title=Down syndrome |publisher=Mayo Clinic |date=2014-04-19 |accessdate=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics today conclude that 90 percent of fetuses that are diagnosed with Down syndrome via fetal genetic testing are aborted. However, only 2-3 percent of women agree to completing genetic testing, CVS or amniocentesis, the current tests for chromosomal abnormalities. When taking this into account, it is believed that approximately 50 percent of fetuses with Down Syndrome are aborted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/thinplaces/2012/06/down-syndrome-prenatal-testing-and-abortion-its-complicated/ |title=Down syndrome, prenatal testing, and abortion–it’s complicated |website=Patheos.com |date=2012-06-10 |accessdate=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proponents of disability-selective abortion==
Support for disability-selective abortions stems from arguments that those born with disabilities have a quality of life that is reduced to the extent that non-existence is preferable, and terminating the pregnancy is actually for the sake of the future child.&lt;ref name="VEHMAS" /&gt; Some argue that abortion of fetuses with disabilities is moral in that it prevents the child and/or parents from suffering, and that the decision to abort is not made lightly. One such example comes from the utilitarian perspective of [[Peter Singer]] who argues that abortion of healthy fetuses is not justified, but that disability-selective abortions are justified if the total amount of happiness will be greater by doing so.&lt;ref name=STANGL&gt;STANGL, R. (2010). Selective Terminations and Respect for the Disabled. ''Journal of Medicine &amp; Philosophy'', 35(1), 32-45. doi:10.1093/jmp/jhp058&lt;/ref&gt; His justification for such line of thinking comes not only from the quality of life for the child, but also the suffering of the parents and lack of willing adoptive parents for children with disabilities.&lt;ref name="STANGL" /&gt;

==Opposition to disability-selective abortion==
Several different arguments lie at the heart of opposition for disability-selective abortions. Those against disability-selective abortions often quote the right to life of all fetuses. Further arguments include that such abortions are based on misinformation or stereotypes about the lives of people with disabilities.&lt;ref name=VEHMAS&gt;Vehmas, S. (2002). Is it wrong to deliberately conceive or give birth to a child with mental retardation?. ''Journal of Medicine &amp; Philosophy'', 27(1), 47-63.&lt;/ref&gt; Others consider abortion of fetuses with disabilities a form of discrimination, arguing that abortion after a positive diagnosis sends the message that a life with disability is not worth living.&lt;ref name=BATZLI&gt;Batzli, K. (2010). The Expressivity of Prenatal Testing and Selective Abortion for Disability. ''Penn Bioethics Journal'', 6(1), 21-24&lt;/ref&gt;  Disability and feminist activists warn against the eugenic possibilities of disability-selective abortions for the disabled community. Reproductive rights activists not only fight for women’s right to abortion, but also for their right to choose not to use prenatal testing. A notable pro-choice supporter who condemned disability-selective abortion was [[Adrienne Asch]], who believed that perceived problems associated with disability were not attributable to the disability itself but an absence of social support and acceptance.&lt;ref name=ASCH&gt;ASCH, A. (1999). Prenatal Diagnosis and Selective Abortion: A Challenge to Practice and Policy. ''American Journal of Public Health'', 89(11), 1649-1657&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved March 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to an article in ''Disability Studies Quarterly'', the disability rights movement in [[Germany]] has disapproved of abortion in cases in which the fetus is found to have a congenital defect. This issue for the German disability-rights movement has continuity going back to the early [[eugenics]] movement, through to the [[Nazism|Nazi]] era, when [[Nazi eugenics|Nazi eugenic]] practices became a concern, and on into the present.&lt;ref&gt;Köbsell, Swantje.

*A report given to the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board and [[Law Reform Commission of New South Wales|NSW Law Reform Commission]] by the AIS Support Group of Australia (AISSGA) reviewed the [[Australia]]n incidence of abortion in cases when the fetus was diagnosed with an [[intersexuality|intersex condition]]. Between 1983 and 1998, the [[Government of Victoria|Victorian Department of Human Services]] reported that 98 out of 213 fetuses detected to have [[Turner syndrome]]  had been aborted, 28 out of 77 found to have [[Klinefelter syndrome]], and 39 out of 189 fetuses with sex chromosome anomalies had been aborted. The AISSGA proposed that parents expecting children with sex chromosome anomalies be advised by a [[genetic counseling|genetic counselor]], and be given contact with support groups for people with these conditions, so as to gain a better understanding of the actual effects of the conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Briffa, Anthony.

'''Gerson von Bleichröder''' (22 December 1822 – 18 February 1893) was a [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]] [[Germany|German]] [[banker]].

Bleichröder was born in [[Berlin]]. He was the eldest son of [[Samuel Bleichröder]], who founded the banking firm of [[S. Bleichröder]] in 1803 in Berlin.  Gerson first joined the family business in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritz Stern]], ''Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichröder and the Building of the German Empire'' (Vintage Books: New York, 1977) p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1855 upon the death of his father, Gerson became the head of the banking firm.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern, ''Gold and Iron: Bismarck ' Bleichröder and the Building of the German Empire'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  The bank maintained close contacts with the [[Rothschild family]]; the banking house of Bleichröder acted as a branch office in Berlin of the Rothschilds' bank.

Traditionally, the Rothschilds represented the banking interests of the Austrian-controlled  German Confederation in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern, ''Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichröder and the Building of the German Empire'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the conflict between the rapidly rising and expanding nation of Prussia and the "pro-Austrian" German Confederation, the Rothschild Bank was largely caught in an uncomfortable position in the middle of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern, ''Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichroder and the Building of the German Empire'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meeting Bismarck==
Since 1851, [[Otto von Bismarck]] had been serving as the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] ambassador to the [[German Confederation]] headquartered at Frankfurt-am-Main, a [[City-state|free city]] of the Confederation in what is now western Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Steinberg, ''Bismarck: A Life'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2011) p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in March 1858, Bismarck was appointed ambassador to the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Steinberg, ''Bismarck: A Life'', p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;  In one of his last actions before leaving Frankfurt for St. Petersburg, Russia, Bismarck consulted Baron [[Mayer Carl von Rothschild]] for the name of a banker in Berlin to whom he could turn for personal as well as Prussian state business.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern, ''Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichröder and the Building of the German Empire'', p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Just why Bismarck would turn to the Rothschild Bank to supply him with the name of a competing bank to whom Bismarck and the Prussian nation could turn may not be as hard to understand as first thought.  Everyone in Frankfurt knew that the Prussian nation would have to distance themselves from the Rothschild Bank given the Rothschilds' close diplomatic relations with Prussia's main rival—[[Austria-Hungary]].  Yet neither Bismarck nor the Prussian nation wanted to burn their bridges and totally alienate the Rothschilds.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern, ''Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichröder and the Building of the German Empire'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  What better way to avoid this fissure with the Rothschilds than to ask the Rothschilds to provide the name of an alternative bank.

Rothschild gave the name of Gerson Bleichröder, who took over Bismarck's private banking transactions as well as the transfer of credits and/or placing of loans on behalf of the [[Prussia]]n state and the [[German Empire]]. Thus, Bleichröder became intimately involved with not only Bismarck but also with the inner dynamics of the unification of Germany.

==Unification of the German States==
Over the decades since the life of Bismarck, it has become an article of faith among German historians that Bismarck, himself, was the agent most responsible for the unification of Germany under the Prussian throne.  This proposition, based on the "Great Man Theory" of history has been effectively challenged by recent historians.  Importantly, German economic historian [[Helmut Böhme]] argued that the [[Zollverein]] customs union of northern Germany, not Bismarck, was the most important agent in unifying Germany.

Consider the largely German-speaking territory in the middle of Europe at the end of the Napoleonic Era.  There was no single German state.  Rather there was a vast patchwork of small principalities, dukedoms and kingdoms.  As the largest and most powerful of the German-speaking states in middle Europe, the Austrian Empire assumed the role of leader of all the German-speaking states of middle Europe.  The [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 established the German Confederation which organized nearly all of the German-speaking states under the control of the dual authority of Austria and Prussia.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Kock, ''A History of Prussia'' (Dorset Press,: New York, 1978), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Prussia was clearly the weaker power in this dual authority within the German Confederation.  Economically, the Austrian Empire based itself on the landowning aristocracy.  This landowning aristocracy required the Austrian state to maintain high [[tariffs]] against the cheap imports of raw farm products.  This kept prices of food products within the Austrian Empire higher than in other areas of Europe.  Prussia, because of its location near the Baltic Sea was an up-and-coming power in Europe based on the new economy of trade, commerce and manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Kock, ''A History of Prussia'', p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;   As an economy based largely on trade, the Prussian economy thrived only when barriers to trade were reduced—barriers like high protective tariffs on imports from other countries.  Accordingly, Prussia united with other German states in 1818 to form a customs union—the [[Zollverein]].  The states which joined the Zollverein were other German states who profited from trade and who thus favored low tariffs or even "[[free trade]]".  Generally, the states that joined the Zollverein were located in the northern part of the German-speaking region of Europe.  The Zollverein was a Prussian-dominated economic union of German-speaking states.

Because of the rising power of the Zollverein, [[Frederick William IV]] (1795-1861),&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Bismarck: A Life'', p. 557.&lt;/ref&gt; king of Prussia from the death of his father in 1840&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Kock, ''A History of Prussia'', pp. 226-227.&lt;/ref&gt;  until 1861, began to entertain visions of a new political union of German states which would grow out of the Zollverein.  The Austrian-controlled German Confederation had been disbanded during the [[Revolution of 1848]].  Frederick William IV's chief minister from April 25, 1849 until November 1850,  was General Joseph von Radowitz.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Palmer, ''Bismarck'' (Charles Scribner's Sons Publishers: New York, 1976) p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;   Radowitz now sought to establish a new Prussian-dominated union to replace the old German Confederation.  In October 1850, an agreement was made to have an assembly of all German states meet in the city of Erfurt, Germany to form this "Prussian Union."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Palmer, ''Bismarck'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of the Erfurt Union, Bismarck did not have any use for the proposed union of German states under Prussian leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Palmer, ''Bismarck'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  Just why Bismarck of all people would refuse to support a unification in Germany under Prussian leadership in 1850 and just ten years later become the chief spokesman for just such a Prussian-led union of German states is curious, but as strong as the Zollverein was in 1850, the customs union, by 1860, had become much more influential over the economies of its members.

Between 1850 and 1860, the members of the Zollverein adopted a common currency, a common postal system and a common commercial code.&lt;ref&gt;William T. Couch ''et al.'' "Germany" contained in ''Collier's Encyclopedia: Volume 9'' (P. F. Collier and Son Pub.: New York, 1959) p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later the Zollverein signed various reciprocal treaties with nations outside the customs union, culminating in the signing of a reciprocal treaty with France in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;William T. Couch,"Germany" contained in ''Collier's Encyclopedia: Volume 9'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  From this position of power, the Zollverein brought about the rapid industrialization of northern Germany and became a prime reason for Prussian involvement in the [[Second Schleswig War|Second Schleswig-Holstein War of 1864]].  As result of that war, two predominately German-speaking duchies, Schleswig and Holstein were ceded by Denmark and annexed by Prussia and Austria.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Koch, ''A History of Prussia'', pp. 256-257.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another war, the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, and the dramatic military defeat of Austria at the [[Battle of Sadowa]], resulted in both Schleswig and Holstein being ceded to Prussia alone.  Neither of these duchies had much in the way of mineral wealth or industry.  Even as late as the middle of the twentieth century, both duchies remained predominately rural with only 24% of the total population living in the main cities of Kiel ( 1950 pop. 218,335) and Lubeck (1950 pop. 133,021).&lt;ref&gt;James K. Pollock, ''et al.'', ''Germany in Power and Eclipse'' (D. Van Nostrand Publishing Co.: Toronto, Canada, 1952) p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the duchies were to have a great impact on the industrialization of northern Germany because of their location and topography.  As early as 1784, a canal had been operating across the "neck" of the Jutland Peninsula on which Denmark is located.  This canal was known as the [[Eider Canal]] because it largely followed the winding Eider River across the Jutland Peninsula.  The Eider Canal saved a great deal of time and money in eliminating the need of ships to sail the long and dangerous way around the Jutland Peninsula to deliver cargo from the Baltic Sea to the North Sea or vice versa.  However, by 1860, shipping had gone from sail to steam and the Eider canal had been largely outdated.  Accordingly, rebuilding of the Eider Canal or construction of a new canal was drastically needed.  After the annexation of Schleswig by Prussia, the Prussian government set about improving the Eider Canal by building a new canal along a shorter, more direct route and by widening the canal to fit modern ships.&lt;ref&gt;James K. Pollock ''et al.'', ''Germany in Power and Decline'', p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;  Commercial pressure encouraged the development of the new canal which, when completed in 1887, was named the [[Kiel Canal|Kaiser Willhelm Canal]].  Indeed, the economic motivation behind the canal most probably was the main motivation for the war on Denmark in the first place.

The [[Second Schleswig War|Schleswig-Holstein War of 1864]] was the first of three wars which are credited with bringing about the unification of Germany into a single state under the authority of the Prussian crown.  The second war was the [[Austro-Prussian War of 1866]] and the third and final war was the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870.  In January 1871, a ceremony was held in Versailles which made William I of Prussia the German Emperor of the now unified German Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Palmer, ''Bismarck'', p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;  This, then, is the background of the building of the German Empire against which the relationship of Gerson Bleichröder and Otto von Bismarck played itself out.

==Banker for Bismarck and the Prussian State==
[[File:Gerson von Bleichröder.jpg|thumb|Gerson von Bleichröder]]
Gerson Bleichröder served Bismarck at several crucial points during the period of time that Bismarck was the chief minister to the Prussian king.  As a result of the Schleswig War of 1864, Prussia and Austria, as joint victors in that war, were awarded the two German-speaking duchies of Schleswig and Holstein on August 1, 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern, ''Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichröder and the Building of the German Empire'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;   Prussia annexed the more northern duchy of Schleswig, while Austria was given annexation control over the more southern duchy of Holstein.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Bismarck: A Life'', p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;  Austria did not share any border with the newly acquired duchies, but the duchy of Holstein was located between Schleswig to the north and Prussian-controlled territories to the south.  Austria sought to create difficulties for its up-and-coming rival—Prussia—by entertaining the idea of inviting the heir of the deposed [[House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg]]—[[Frederick VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein|Duke Frederick VIII of Augustenburg]]—back to administer the Holstein duchy.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Bismarck: A Life'', p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;  This solution was intolerable to Prussia because the Duke of Augustenburg was related to the royal family of Denmark.  The fear was that this would have brought Danish troops right back to same frontier that they had occupied prior to the war.  Furthermore, the Prussian-annexed Schleswig duchy (where the Prussian government was intending to upgrade the Kiel Canal) would be isolated from the rest of Prussian Germany.

Accordingly, a plan was developed for Prussia to purchase all Austrian "rights" to the duchies before any transfer of those rights could be made to Duke Frederick.  The deal had a good chance of succeeding because the Austria Empire was in financial trouble at the time. Gerson Bleichröder opened secret negotiations with [[Moritz Ritter von Goldschmidt]] to pay a large sum of money to Austria for any and all rights to the two duchies of Holstein and Schleswig.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Bismarck: A Life'', p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end, the administration of Holstein was not settled until 1866, after the [[Austro-Prussian War]].

Meanwhile, Bismarck still faced the problem of raising money to pay for the Schleswig-Holstein War.  To be sure, the victory in that war had brought glory to Bismarck and the Prussian nation.  However, the elected United Prussian Diet which had the authority to raise public funds to pay for the war was still dragging its feet about paying for the Schleswig War despite the glory to the Prussian nation. Furthermore, Bismarck as a monarchist had long detested elected parliaments of all kinds and he especially hated going "hat in hand" to the United Diet to beg for money.  Accordingly, Gerson Bleichröder developed several plans by which money could be raised without going to the United Diet.  For instance there was the ''Preussische Seenhandlung'', a bank that had been founded by [[Frederick the Great]] in 1772, that still operated as an independent institute under the Prussian throne.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Bismarck: A Life'', p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;  Money could be raised by the king independently of the Diet by either selling shares of the bank or by arranging a bond issue through the bank.  In the summer of 1865, the Rothschild Bank, working through Gerson Bleichröder, underwrote an entire public offering of bonds against the government shares of ''Seehandlung''.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichröder and the Building of the German Empire'', p.231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, much of the railroad-building in Germany had been done with public funds.  In exchange for the public funds the government had taken part ownership in the railways.  Consequently, by 1860, the government had a large investment in all the railroads in Germany.  One of these railroads was the ''Cologne-Minden Railroad''.  Gerson Bleichröder just happened be the banker for the ''Cologne-Minden Railroad'' and sat on the Board of Directors of the railroad.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern, Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichröder and the Building of the German Empire, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  Once again the government could sell its shares in this railroad or establish a loan with the government shares as collateral.   In the end the government shares in the ''Cologne-Minden Railroad'' were sold to raise money independently of the United Diet.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Bismarck: A Life'', p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spectacular victory of the Prussian Army at the [[battle of Sadowa]] (Könnigrätz), on July 3, 1866 during the Austro-Prussian War, changed the entire face of Europe.  Many of the small German states flocked to the banner of Prussia by joining the new Prussian-led [[North German Confederation]] which was formed in April 1867.  No longer merely an economic union like the Zollverein, the North German Confederation had a constitution and a democratically elected ''[[Reichstag (North German Confederation)|Reichstag]]'' based on universal popular  sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern, ''Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichröder and the Building of the German Empire'', p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;  Inside the North German Confederation, the German nation was completely integrated under Prussian rule.  However, the three large south-German states of Bavaria, Württemberg and Baden remained outside of the Confederation.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern, ''Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichröder and the Building of the German Empire'', p.121.&lt;/ref&gt;  These German states hoped to remain independent of the Confederation and had looked to Austria for protection from forced absorption into the Prussian-dominated Confederation.  However, since the utter defeat of the Austrians at the battle of Sadowa, the three south-German states had begun to look to an alliance of Austria and France as their only protection.  Thus, war clouds rose again as Prussia began to see France as the major obstacle to unification of all Germany under the Prussian throne.  It has been a matter of dispute between recent German historians as to whether Bismarck wanted war with France or not.  Some historians feel that Bismarck was forced into a war he did not want.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Palmer, ''Bismarck'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others view Bismarck as actively pushing war with France continuously from the time of the Battle of Sadowa.  The reason there are no clear historical records to resolve this conflict is that whatever Bismarck's views on war with France, he insisted on keeping his views very much private.  What contacts he had with France regarding the political situation were made in a furtive way.  Once again he turned to Gerson Bleichröder to handle these back-channel communications with the French government.  During July 1870, Bleichröder was in frequent contact with the Rothchilds in Paris—bankers to Napoleon III and the French government—to ascertain Napoleon's true intentions with regard to war.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern, ''Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichröder and the Building of the German Empire'' p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the chief banker for Bismarck and the Prussian state, Gerson Bleichröder was also in a position to help several influential German families in their hour of need.  In 1868, an ambitious 915-mile railroad project in Rumania, which would link the Rumanian capital, Bucharest, with all other major parts of the country, was touted to investors by financier [[Bethel Henry Strousberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Keith Hitchins, ''Rumania: 1866-1947'' (Clarendon Press: Oxford, England, 1994) p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in 1871, while construction of the railway was underway, the consortium headed by Strussberg went into bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Hitchins, ''Rumania: 1866-1947'', p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to help a few prominent German families out of their rash and speculative investments in the Strussberg consortium, the entire Strussberg consortium was purchased out of bankruptcy by another consortium headed by Gerson Bleichröder and supported by Otto von Bismarck.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Palmer, ''Bismarck'' (Charles Scribner's Sons Publishers: New York, 1976) p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, Gerson Bleichröder became an accepted part of even non-Jewish and often anti-Semitic German society.  He became a partner at the investment bank of [[Ladenburg Thalmann]]. Bleichröder and his family were made Prussian nobles on 8 March 1872, in [[Berlin]]. Bleichröder was only the second Jew in Prussia to be [[ennoble]]d.  Bleichröder was preceded only by [[Abraham Oppenheim]], another banker close to the regime, ennobled four years earlier.

The German-American historian [[Fritz Stern]] wrote a double-biography of Otto von Bismarck and Gerson von Bleichröder, ''Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichröder, and the Building of the German Empire'' {{ISBN|0394740343}}.

'''Ghetto benches''' (known in Polish as ''getto ławkowe'')&lt;ref name="adl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="netfirms"/&gt; was a form of official segregation in the seating of students, introduced in 1935 at the [[Lwow Polytechnic]].&lt;ref name="Antisemitism and Its Opponents in Modern Poland"/&gt; [[Rector (academia)|Rectors]] at other [[higher education]] institutions in the [[Second Polish Republic]] had adopted this form of segregation when the practice became conditionally legalized by 1937.&lt;ref name="maxveritas"/&gt; Under the ''ghetto ławkowe'' system, Jewish university students were required under threat of expulsion, to sit in a left-hand side section of the lecture halls reserved exclusively for them. This official policy of enforced segregation was often accompanied by acts of violence directed against Jewish students by members of the [[National Radical Camp (1934)|ONR]] (outlawed after three months in 1934) and other extreme right and anti-Semitic organizations like the [[National Democracy]] movement.&lt;ref name="dia30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eliyahu Yones 2004 25"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eliyahu Yones|title=Smoke in the Sand: The Jews of Lvov in the War Years 1939-1944|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=70_5lXXSL6YC&amp;pg=PA25|year=2004|publisher=Gefen Books|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seating in benches marked a peak of [[antisemitism]] in Poland between the world wars according to [[Jerzy Jan Lerski]].&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; It antagonized not only Jews, but also many Poles.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; Jewish students protested these policies, along with some Poles who supported them by standing instead of sitting.&lt;ref name="Diagh"/&gt; The segregation continued until the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] in [[World War II]]. [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|Poland's occupation by Nazi Germany]] suppressed the entire [[education in Poland|Polish education]]al system. In the eastern half of Poland annexed by the [[Soviet Union]], similar discriminatory policies were lifted in exchange for other repressive actions against Jews.&lt;ref name="Tomasz Kamusella, Krzysztof Jaskułowski 2009 203"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tomasz Kamusella, Krzysztof Jaskułowski|title=Nationalisms Today|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=r_0rT6V_OV4C&amp;pg=PA203|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang AG, International Academic Publishers|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{further|History of the Jews in 20th-century Poland}}
The percentage of Poland's Jewish population increased greatly during the [[Russian Civil War]]. Following Poland's return to independence, several hundred thousand Jews joined the already numerous Polish Jewish minority living predominantly in the cities.&lt;ref name="Kadish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt; The new arrivals were the least assimilated of all European Jewish communities of that period.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; [[Polish Jews]] formed the second largest minority after Polish Ukrainians, of about 10 percent of the total population of the [[Polish Second Republic]]. Jewish representation in the institutions of higher learning began to increase already during [[World War I]]. By early 1920s, Jews constituted over one-third of all students attending Polish universities.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; The difficult situation in the private sector, compounded by the [[Great Depression]],&lt;ref name="Snyder"&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Timothy Snyder |first=Timothy |last=Snyder |title=The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569–1999 |publisher=Yale University Press |ISBN=0-300-10586-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN030010586X&amp;id=xSpEynLxJ1MC&amp;pg=PA144 |p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to a massive enrollment in universities. In 1923 the Jewish students constituted 62.9 percent of all students of [[stomatology]], 34 percent of medical sciences, 29.2 percent of philosophy, 24.9 percent of chemistry and 22.1 percent of law (26 percent by 1929) at all Polish universities. Their number, which remained out of proportion with that of the overwhelmingly [[gentile]] population of Poland during the [[Interbellum]], were the probable cause of a backlash.&lt;ref name="AJ"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sytuacja prawna mniejszosci żydowskiej w Drugiej Rzeczypospolitej |trans-title=The legal status of the Jewish minority in the Second Republic |at=pp. 65–66 (20/38 in PDF) |author=Anna Jaskóła, [[University of Wrocław]] |publisher=Wydział Prawa, Administracji i Ekonomii.

Proposals to reinstitute the ''[[numerus clausus]]'', which would restrict Jewish enrollment to 10 percent of the student body (roughly the percentage of Jews living in Poland) were made as early as 1923. However, as this would have violated the [[Little Treaty of Versailles]], the proposals were rejected. In spite of these earlier objections, Poland later renounced the Treaty in 1934.&lt;ref name="Cieplinski"/&gt; Polish nationalism and hostility towards minorities, particularly Jews, increased.&lt;ref name="dia30"/&gt;  Discriminatory policies regarding [[History of Jews in Poland|Jews]] in education in Poland continued the practice of the [[Russian Empire]]'s ''numerus clausus'' policy, implemented by the Empire during [[partitions of Poland|Poland's partitions]], which restricted, by means of [[Jewish quota|quota]]s, the participation of [[Jews]] in public life.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; Issues that had earlier been resolved by the [[Russian Empire]] were now decided locally, uniting the Poles while dividing the nation as a whole.&lt;ref name="haller1"/&gt;

Various means of limiting the number of Jewish students were adopted, seeking to reduce the Jewish role in Poland's economic and social life.&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt; The situation of Jews improved under  [[Józef Piłsudski]],&lt;ref name="Cieplinski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; but after his death in 1935 the [[National Democracy|National Democrats]] regained much of their power and the status of Jewish students deteriorated. A student "Green Ribbon" League was organized in 1931; its members distributed anti-semitic material and called for the boycott of Jewish businesses and the enforcement of the ''numerus clausus''.&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google4"/&gt; In 1934 a group of [[rabbi]]s petitioned the [[Archbishop]] of Warsaw, [[Aleksander Kakowski]], to stop the "youthful outbursts"; Kakowski responded that the incidents were regrettable, but also stated that Jewish newspapers were "infecting public culture with atheism."&lt;ref name="Cieplinski"/&gt;

Agitation against Jewish students intensified during the [[Great Depression|economic recession of the 1930s]] and afterwards, as unemployment began to affect the Polish intellectual strata.&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt; There were growing demands to decrease the number of Jews in science and business so that "Christian" Poles could fill their positions.&lt;ref name="dia30"/&gt; In November 1931, violence accompanied demands to reduce the number of Jewish students at several Polish universities.&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt; The universities' autonomous status contributed to this,&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt; as university [[Rector (academia)|rector]]s tended not to call in police to protect Jewish students from attacks on the campuses,&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt; and no action was taken against students involved in anti-Jewish violence.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melzer73"/&gt;

==Attempts to legalize segregated seating==
In 1935, students associated with [[National Democracy]] and the [[National Radical Camp (1934)|National Radical Camp]], influenced by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Nuremberg Laws]],&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt; demanded [[Racial segregation|segregation]] of Jews into separate sections in the classrooms, known as "ghetto benches".&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt; The majority of Jewish students refused to accept this system of seating, considering it to be a violation of their [[civil rights]].&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt; At some universities Polish students even attempted to forcibly move Jews to the ghetto benches.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt;

Following [[Józef Piłsudski|Piłsudski]]'s death in 1935, anti-Jewish riots broke out at the [[University of Warsaw]] and the [[Warsaw Polytechnic]]. The violence spread from the campuses to the streets of Warsaw.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt; Subsequently violence broke out at other universities in Poland as well.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt; The student riots and violence were however mutual. Especially Jewish students from Academic Zionist Association "Kadimah" (Akademicki Związek Syjonistyczny "Kadimah") were involved in violence against Polish students.&lt;ref name="kulińska"/&gt; An uninterrupted wave of anti-Jewish violence eventually led to the temporary closure of all of Warsaw's institutions of higher education in November 1935. The [[National Democracy]] press put the blame for the riots on Jews  refusing to comply with special seating arrangements set by Polish students.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt;

==Introduction of ghetto benches==
[[File:Żądamy urzędowego getta Obóz Narodowo-Radykalny Politechnika Lwowska.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstration of Polish students demanding implementation of ghetto benches at [[Lwów Polytechnic]] in 1930s.]]

While the Polish government initially opposed the segregation policies, the universities enjoyed significant level of autonomy and were able to impose their local regulations. Ghetto benches were officially sanctioned for the first time in December 1935 at the [[Lwów Polytechnic]].&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt; Following several violent attacks against the Jewish students, school officials ordered that they sit in separate sections, under threat of expulsion.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; Penalties were imposed on those who stayed away from classes in protest against segregated seating.&lt;ref name="Melzer73"/&gt; The move to legalize ghetto benches was contested by the Jewish community, which saw it as a dangerous precedent. Ghetto benches were criticized by Jewish deputies to the ''[[Sejm]]'' (Polish parliament). In January 1936, a delegation of representatives of the Jewish community of [[Lviv|Lwów]] (''Lviv'') met with [[Polish Ministry of Education|Poland's Education Minister]], who promised to discuss the issue with school administrations, and in February 1936 the ghetto-bench order was cancelled by the Lwów Polytechnic's [[academic senate]].&lt;ref name="Melzer73"/&gt;

This setback for the segregationist cause did not stop attempts to establish ghetto benches in other Polish universities. Demands for segregated seating were again raised by the [[Obóz Zjednoczenia Narodowego|OZON]]-led [[Union of Young Poland]] (''[[:pl:Związek Młodej Polski|Związek Młodej Polski]]''),&lt;ref name="Melzer74"/&gt; the ''[[National Democracy|ND]]'' [[All-Polish Youth]], and other nationalist youth organizations.&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt; The Ministry of Education in Warsaw was opposed to the ghetto benches, declaring ''[[numerus clausus]]'' a violation of the constitution, and Polish Minister of Education stated that: "Student ghettos would not be introduced at the Polish Universities".&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; However, in light of the continuing serious riots at the university, which the Ministry condemned as "zoological patriotism", the Ministry slowly gave in and decided to withdraw its opposition, hoping that the introduction of the ghettos would end the riots.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; The ethno-nationalists finally won their campaign for ghetto benches in 1937 when by Ministry decision universities were granted the right to regulate the seating of Polish and Jewish students.&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt; On October 5, 1937, the Rector of [[Warsaw Polytechnic]] ordered the establishment of the institution of ghetto benches in the lecture halls.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; Within a few days, similar orders were given in other universities of Poland.&lt;ref name="Melzer76"/&gt;

Over 50 notable Polish professors (including [[Marceli Handelsman]], [[Stanisław Ossowski]], [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], and [[Manfred Kridl]]) criticized the introduction of the ghetto benches,&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; and refused to enforce either a quota, or the ghetto bench system, but their voices were ignored together with those gentile students who objected the policy;&lt;ref name="Watts"/&gt; they would protest by standing in class, and refusing to sit down.&lt;ref name="Diagh"/&gt; Rector [[Władysław Marian Jakowicki]] of the [[Stefan Batory University]] in Wilno (Vilnius) resigned from his position in protest of the introduction of the benches.&lt;ref name="Hass1999"/&gt; The only rector that refused to establish ghetto benches in his university was Prof. [[Stanisław Kulczyński]] of [[Lwów University]]. Facing the decision to sign the order introducing segregated seating, Prof. Kulczyński resigned from his position instead of signing it.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melzer76"/&gt; Nevertheless, the instruction ordering special "mandatory seats" for all Jewish students still was issued by the vice-rector of Lwów University the next morning.&lt;ref name="Melzer76"/&gt; The only faculty in Poland that did not have ghetto benches introduced was that of the Children's Clinic in the [[Piłsudski University of Warsaw]] led by Professor [[Mieczysław Michałowicz]], who refused to obey to the Rector's order.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; Some fifty-six professors of Warsaw, Poznań, and Wilno universities signed a protest against the Ghetto benches in December 1937. The list included the "elite of Polish scholarship", signatories such as [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], sociologists [[Józef Chałasiński]], [[Stanisław Ossowski|Stanisław]] and [[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Jan Stanisław Bystroń]], biologists [[Stanisław Kulczyński]] and [[Jan Bohdan Dembowski|Jan Dembowski]], psychologist [[Władysław Witwicki]], physicist [[Konstanty Zakrzewski]], and historians [[Seweryn Wysłouch]] and [[Tadeusz Manteuffel]].&lt;ref name="Connelly"/&gt;

The introduction of ghetto benches was criticized internationally. Over 300 British professors signed an anti-ghetto bench manifesto. In New York, the League for Academic Freedom published an open letter signed by 202 professors condemning ghetto benches as "alien to the spirit of academic freedom."&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt;

Despite the arguments by [[Sanacja]] government that introduction of ghetto benches would stop the disturbances, the clashes between Jewish and gentile youth resulted in two fatalities among the Jewish students,&lt;ref name="dia30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt; and further assaults, or even an assassination attempt on Polish professor Konrad Górski critical of the segregation policies.&lt;ref name="Connelly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dia30"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The ghetto bench system and other anti-Semitic demonstrations of the segment of student youth inspired vengeance among some Jewish students of [[Lwów Polytechnic]] upon the arrival of the Soviet authorities, following the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasion of Poland]].&lt;ref name="Politechnika"/&gt;

The practice of segregated seating for the Jewish students in Poland ended with the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|demise of the Polish state]] in the beginning of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. After which most Polish educational institutions were shut down (see [[Education in Poland during World War II]]) although [[Lwów Polytechnic]] remained. Most [[Polish Jews]] perished during the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|German occupation of Poland]] in the [[Holocaust in Poland|Holocaust]].

{{Health care reform in the United States}}
The '''healthcare reform debate in the United States''' has been a political issue focusing upon increasing medical coverage, decreasing costs, insurance reform, and the philosophy of its provision, funding, and government involvement. 

== Details ==
Following the [[United States presidential election, 2008|election of Barack Obama]] as president, who campaigned heavily on accomplishing [[health care reform]], the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA) was enacted in March 2010. However, in the next [[United States presidential election, 2016|election of Donald Trump]] as president, he campaigned to repeal and replace Obamacare and came up with a seven-point plan for healthcare reform. With this seven point plan President Trump discussed that the healthcare system would work based on free market principles. According to [[Ballotpedia]], he stated that he would repeal Obamacare, reduce barriers to the interstate sale of health insurance, institute a full tax deduction for insurance premium payments for individuals, make Health Saving Accounts inheritable, require price transparency, block-grant Medicaid to the states, and allow for more overseas drug providers through lowered regulatory barriers. Trump added that enforcing immigration laws could reduce healthcare costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign,_2016/Healthcare | title=Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016/healthcare |date=2016 |accessdate=May 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this seven point plan has not taken the place of Obamacare, and it is possible that Obamacare will not be repealed but instead it will be modified so that all parts of this plan work accordingly.

== Cost debate ==
U.S. healthcare costs were approximately $3.2 trillion or nearly $10,000 per person on average in 2015. Major categories of expense include hospital care (32%), physician and clinical services (20%), and prescription drugs (10%).&lt;ref name="CDC_NCHS1"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/health-expenditures.htm CDC-National Center for Health Statistics-Retrieved July 2, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. costs in 2016 were substantially higher than other OECD countries, at 17.2% GDP versus 12.4% GDP for the next most expensive country (Switzerland).&lt;ref name="OECD_HS1"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/health-data.htm OECD Health Stats-Health Expenditure and Financing-Retrieved July 2, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; For scale, a 5% GDP difference represents about $1 trillion or $3,000 per person. Some of the many reasons cited for the cost differential with other countries include: Higher administrative costs of a private system with multiple payment processes; higher costs for the same products and services; more expensive volume/mix of services with higher usage of more expensive specialists; aggressive treatment of very sick elderly versus palliative care; less use of government intervention in pricing; and higher income levels driving greater demand for healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/why-does-health-care-cost-so-much-in-america-ask-harvards-david-cutler/ PBS-Why does health care cost so muc in America?

In 2009, the U.S. had the highest [[health care prices in the United States|health care costs]] relative to the size of the economy (GDP) in the world, with an estimated 50.2 million citizens (approximately 16% of the September 2011 estimated population of 312 million) without insurance coverage. Some critics of reform counter that almost four out of ten of these uninsured come from a household with over $50,000 income per year, and thus might be uninsured voluntarily, or opting to pay for health care services on a "pay-as-you-go" basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2009/09/383-of-uninsured-americans-live-in.html|title=Almost 4 Out of 10 Uninsured Americans Live in Households Making More Than $50,000 Per Year|work=CARPE DIEM}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further, an estimated 77 million [[Baby Boomers]] are reaching retirement age, which combined with significant annual increases in healthcare costs per person will place enormous budgetary strain on U.S. state and federal governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/media/globalexecutive/coming_gen_storm_e_02.pdf | title=The Coming Generational Storm |work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining the long-term fiscal health of the U.S. federal government is significantly dependent on healthcare costs being controlled.&lt;ref name=orzag&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charlierose.com/download/transcript/10697 |title=Charlie Rose–Peter Orszag Interview Transcript |date=November 3, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111174416/http://www.charlierose.com/download/transcript/10697 |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality of care==
There is significant debate regarding the quality of the U.S. healthcare system relative to those of other countries. [[Physicians for a National Health Program]], a political advocacy group, has claimed that a free market solution to healthcare provides a lower quality of care, with higher mortality rates, than publicly funded systems.&lt;ref name="fpb"&gt;[http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/forprofit_hospitals_cost_more_and_have_higher_death_rates.php For-Profit Hospitals Cost More and Have Higher Death Rates], ''Physicians for a National Health Program''&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of [[health maintenance organizations]] and [[managed care]] have also been criticized by this same group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/forprofit_hmos_provide_worse_quality_care.php For-Profit HMOs Provide Worse Quality Care], ''Physicians for a National Health Program''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2015 report from [[The Commonwealth Fund]], although the United States pays almost twice as much per capita towards healthcare as other wealthy countries with universal healthcare, patient outcomes are poorer. The United States has the lowest life expectancy overall and the infant mortality rate is the highest and in some cases twice as high when compared with other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Squires|first1=David|last2=Anderson|first2=Chloe|title=U.S. Health Care from a Global Perspective|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2015/oct/us-health-care-from-a-global-perspective|publisher=The Commonwealth Fund|language=en|date=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also highlighted in this report is data that shows that although Americans have one of the lowest percentages of daily smokers, they have the highest mortality rate for heart disease, a significantly higher obesity rate and more amputations due to diabetes.  Other health related issues highlighted were that Americans over the age of 65 have a higher percentage of the population with two or more chronic conditions and the lowest percentage of that age group living.

According to a 2000 study of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), publicly funded systems of industrial nations spend less on healthcare, both as a percentage of their GDP and per capita, and enjoy superior population-based health care outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf |title=Prelims i-ixx/E |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, conservative commentator [[David Gratzer]] and the [[Cato Institute]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] think tank, have both criticized the WHO's comparison method for being biased; the WHO study marked down countries for having private or fee-paying health treatment and rated countries by comparison to their expected healthcare performance, rather than objectively comparing quality of care.&lt;ref name="fmc"&gt;[[David Gratzer]], [http://www.freemarketcure.com/whynotgovhc.php Why Is not Government Health Care The Answer?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312071328/http://www.freemarketcure.com/whynotgovhc.php |date=March 12, 2009 }}, ''Free Market Cure'', July 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glen Whitman, [http://www.cato.org/pubs/bp/bp101.pdf "WHO’s Fooling Who?

Some medical researchers say that patient satisfaction surveys are a poor way to evaluate medical care. Researchers at the [[RAND Corporation]] and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] asked 236 elderly patients in two different managed care plans to rate their care, then examined care in medical records, as reported in [[Annals of Internal Medicine]]. There was no correlation. "Patient ratings of health care are easy to obtain and report, but do not accurately measure the technical quality of medical care," said John T. Chang, [[UCLA]], lead author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wessel |first=David |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115758434624755703 |title=Capital: In health care, consumer theory falls flat|publisher= Wall Street Journal |date=September 7, 2006  |accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Rand study finds patients' ratings of their medical care do not reflect the technical quality of their care |publisher=RAND Corporation |date=May 1, 2006 |url=http://www.rand.org/news/press.06/05.01.html |accessdate=August 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Chang JT, Hays RD, Shekelle PG, etal |title=Patients' global ratings of their health care are not associated with the technical quality of their care |journal=Ann.

There are health losses from insufficient health insurance. A 2009 Harvard study published in the American Journal of Public Health found more than 44,800 excess deaths annually in the United States due to Americans lacking health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pnhp.org/excessdeaths/health-insurance-and-mortality-in-US-adults.pdf|title=American Journal of Public Health &amp;#124; December 2009, Vol. 99, No. 12|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pnhp.org/excessdeaths/excess-deaths-state-by-state.pdf|title=State-by-state breakout of excess deaths from lack of insurance|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, estimates of the total number of people in the United States, whether insured or uninsured, who die because of lack of medical care were estimated in a 1997 analysis to be nearly 100,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;A 1997 study carried out by Professors David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler (''New England Journal of Medicine'' 336, no. 11 1997) "concluded that almost 100,000 people died in the United States each year because of lack of needed care—three times the number of people who died of AIDs."

==Cost and efficiency==
[[File:Total health expenditure per capita, US Dollars PPP.png|thumb|right|350px|Health spending per capita, in US$ [[Purchasing power parity|PPP-adjusted]], compared amongst various first world nations.]]

The United States spends a [[List of countries by total health expenditure (PPP) per capita|higher proportion]] of its GDP on healthcare (19%) than any other country in the world, except for [[East Timor]] (Timor-Leste).&lt;ref name="WHO 2009"&gt;{{cite web |author=WHO |date=May 2009 |title=World Health Statistics 2009 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2009/en/index.html |accessdate=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of employers who offer health insurance is declining. Costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising rapidly: since 2001, premiums for family coverage have increased 78%, while wages have risen 19% and prices have risen 17%, according to a 2007 study by the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Kaiser 2007"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Health Insurance Premiums Rise 6.1% In 2007, Less Rapidly Than In Recent Years But Still Faster Than Wages And Inflation |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=September 11, 2007 |url=http://www.kff.org/insurance/ehbs091107nr.cfm |accessdate=September 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329111855/http://www.kff.org/insurance/ehbs091107nr.cfm |archivedate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private insurance in the US varies greatly in its coverage; one study by the [[Commonwealth Fund]] published in [[Health Affairs]] estimated that 16 million U.S. adults were underinsured in 2003. The underinsured were significantly more likely than those with adequate insurance to forgo healthcare, report financial stress because of medical bills, and experience coverage gaps for such items as prescription drugs. The study found that underinsurance disproportionately affects those with lower incomes&amp;nbsp;– 73% of the underinsured in the study population had annual incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author=Cathy Schoen |author2=Michelle M.

However, a study published by the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] in 2008 found that the typical large employer [[Preferred provider organization]] (PPO) plan in 2007 was more generous than either [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] or the [[Federal Employees Health Benefits Program]] Standard Option.&lt;ref&gt;Dale Yamamoto, Tricia Neuman and Michelle Kitchman Strollo, [http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/7768.pdf ''How Does the Benefit Value of Medicare Compare to the Benefit Value of Typical Large Employer Plans?''], [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; One indicator of the consequences of Americans' inconsistent health care coverage is a study in ''Health Affairs'' that concluded that half of personal bankruptcies involved medical bills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Himmelstein DU, Warren E, Thorne D, Woolhandler S |title=Illness and injury as contributors to bankruptcy |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=Suppl Web Exclusives |pages=W5–63–W5–73 |year=2005 |pmid=15689369 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.w5.63}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other sources dispute this.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Zywicki, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=587901 "An Economic Analysis of the Consumer Bankruptcy Crisis"], 99 NWU L. Rev. 1463 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of healthcare reforms involving expansion of government involvement to achieve universal healthcare argue that the need to provide profits to investors in a predominantly free market health system, and the additional administrative spending, tends to drive up costs, leading to more expensive provision.&lt;ref name="fpb"/&gt;

According to economist and former US Secretary of Labor, [[Robert Reich]], only a "big, national, [[public option]]" can force insurance companies to cooperate, share information, and reduce costs. Scattered, localized, "[[Health insurance cooperative|insurance cooperatives]]" are too small to do that and are "designed to fail" by the moneyed forces opposing Democratic health care reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBi8A_HutII|title=Robert Reich Public Option Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guernicamag.com/daily/robert_reich_how_pharma_and_in/|title=How Pharma and Insurance Intend to Kill the Public Option, And What Obama and the Rest of Us Must Do|date=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on U.S. economic productivity===
On March 1, 2010, billionaire [[Warren Buffett]] said that the high costs paid by U.S. companies for their employees’ healthcare put them at a competitive disadvantage.  He compared the roughly 17% of GDP spent by the U.S. on healthcare with the 9% of GDP spent by much of the rest of the world, noted that the U.S. has fewer doctors and nurses per person, and said, “that kind of a cost, compared with the rest of the world, is like a tapeworm eating at our economic body.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Funk | first = Josh | title = Buffett says economy recovering but at slow rate | newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com) | date = March 1, 2010 | url = http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-03-01/business/18371919_1_berkshire-hathaway-billionaire-warren-buffett-health-care | accessdate =April 3, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306012352/http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-03-01/business/18371919_1_berkshire-hathaway-billionaire-warren-buffett-health-care |archivedate=March 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011 the outgoing Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, Dr. [[Donald Berwick]], asserted that 20% to 30% of healthcare spending is waste.

==Ideas for reform==
{{Further|Health care reforms proposed during the Obama administration}}

During a June 2009 speech, President [[Barack Obama]] outlined his strategy for reform. He mentioned electronic record-keeping, preventing expensive conditions, reducing obesity, refocusing doctor incentives from quantity of care to quality, [[Bundled payment|bundling payments]] for treatment of conditions rather than specific services, better identifying and communicating the most cost-effective treatments, and reducing defensive medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-to-the-Annual-Conference-of-the-American-Medical-Association |title=Remarks by the President to the AMA |date=June 15, 2009 |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313084300/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-to-the-Annual-Conference-of-the-American-Medical-Association/ |archivedate=March 13, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Obama further described his plan in a September 2009 speech to a joint session of Congress. His plan mentions: deficit neutrality; not allowing insurance companies to discriminate based on pre-existing conditions; capping out of pocket expenses; creation of an [[insurance exchange]] for individuals and small businesses; tax credits for individuals and small companies; independent commissions to identify fraud, waste and abuse; and malpractice reform projects, among other topics.&lt;ref name="Summary of Obama Plan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/obama_plan_card.PDF |title=Summary of Obama Plan |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-to-a-Joint-Session-of-Congress-on-Health-Care/ |title=Remarks by the President to a Joint Session of Congress |date=September 2009 |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115143543/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-to-a-Joint-Session-of-Congress-on-Health-Care/ |archivedate=January 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

OMB Director [[Peter Orszag]] described aspects of the Obama administration's strategy during an interview in November 2009: "In order to help contain [Medicare and Medicaid] cost growth over the long term, we need a new healthcare system that has digitized information... in which that information is used to assess what’s working and what’s not more intelligently, and in which we’re paying for quality rather than quantity while also encouraging prevention and wellness." He also argued for bundling payments and [[accountable care organization]]s, which reward doctors for teamwork and patient outcomes.&lt;ref name=orzag/&gt;

[[Mayo Clinic]] President and CEO Denis Cortese has advocated an overall strategy to guide reform efforts. He argued that the U.S. has an opportunity to redesign its healthcare system and that there is a wide consensus that reform is necessary. He articulated four "pillars" of such a strategy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10496|title=Denis Cortese Interview on Charlie Rose Show|date=July 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322151337/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10496|archivedate=March 22, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Focus on value, which he defined as the ratio of quality of service provided relative to cost;
* Pay for and align incentives with value;
* Cover everyone;
* Establish mechanisms for improving the healthcare service delivery system over the long-term, which is the primary means through which value would be improved.

Writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', surgeon [[Atul Gawande]] further distinguished between the delivery system, which refers to how medical services are provided to patients, and the payment system, which refers to how payments for services are processed. He argued that reform of the delivery system is critical to getting costs under control, but that payment system reform (e.g., whether the government or private insurers process payments) is considerably less important yet gathers a disproportionate share of attention. Gawande argued that dramatic improvements and savings in the delivery system will take "at least a decade." He recommended changes that address the [[overutilization]] of healthcare; the refocusing of incentives on value rather than profits; and comparative analysis of the cost of treatment across various healthcare providers to identify best practices. He argued this would be an iterative, empirical process and should be administered by a "national institute for healthcare delivery" to analyze and communicate improvement opportunities.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/06/01/090601fa_fact_gawande|title=The Cost Conundrum|journal=The New Yorker|date=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of comparative effectiveness research===
[[File:Medicare spending per capita.png|thumb|300px|Medicare spending per person varied significantly across states in 2006]]
Several treatment alternatives may be available for a given medical condition, with significantly different costs yet no statistical difference in outcome. Such scenarios offer the opportunity to maintain or improve the quality of care, while significantly reducing costs, through [[comparative effectiveness research]]. Writing in the ''New York Times'', [[David Leonhardt]] described how the cost of treating the most common form of early-stage, slow-growing [[prostate]] cancer ranges from an average of $2,400 (watchful waiting to see if the condition deteriorates) to as high as $100,000 (radiation beam therapy):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/08/business/economy/08leonhardt.html|author=David Leonhardt|title=In Health Reform, A Cancer Offers and Acid Test | work=The New York Times | date=July 8, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010|quote=Some doctors swear by one treatment, others by another. But no one really knows which is best. Rigorous research has been scant. Above all, no serious study has found that the high-technology treatments do better at keeping men healthy and alive. Most die of something else before prostate cancer becomes a problem.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to economist [[Peter A. Diamond]] and research cited by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO), the cost of healthcare per person in the U.S. also varies significantly by geography and medical center, with little or no statistical difference in outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/93xx/doc9317/05-29-NASI_Speech.pdf|author=Peter Diamond|title=Healthcare and Behavioral Economics |date=May 2008|format=PDF|quote=Although the Mayo Clinic scores above the other two in terms of quality of outcome, its cost per beneficiary for Medicare clients in the last six months of life ($26,330) is nearly half that at the UCLA Medical Center ($50,522) and significantly lower than the cost at Massachusetts General Hospital ($40,181)... The American taxpayer is financing these large differences in costs, but we have little evidence of what benefit we receive in exchange.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative effectiveness research has shown that significant cost reductions are possible. [[Office of Management and Budget|OMB]] Director [[Peter Orszag]] stated: "Nearly thirty percent of Medicare's costs could be saved without negatively affecting health outcomes if spending in high- and medium-cost areas could be reduced to the level of low-cost areas."&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;

===Reform of doctor's incentives===
Critics have argued that the healthcare system has several incentives that drive costly behavior. Two of these include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/08/business/economy/08leonhardt.html|title=NYT-Leonhardt-In Health Reform, A Cancer Offers and Acid Test | work=The New York Times | date=July 8, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Doctors are typically paid for services provided rather than with a salary. This payment system (which is often referred to as "[[fee-for-service]]") provides a financial incentive to increase the costs of treatment provided.
# Patients that are fully insured have no financial incentive to minimize the cost when choosing from among alternatives. The overall effect is to increase insurance premiums for all.

===Insurance reforms===
The debate has involved certain insurance industry practices such as the placing of caps on coverage, the high level of co-pays even for essential services such as preventative procedures, the refusal of many insurers to cover pre-existing conditions or adding premium loading for these conditions, and practices which some people regard as egregious such as the additional loading of premiums for women, the regarding of having previously been assaulted by a partner as having a pre-existing condition, and even the cancellation of insurance policies on very flimsy grounds when a claimant who had paid in many premiums presents with a potentially expensive medical condition.

Various legislative proposals under serious consideration propose fining larger employers who do not provide a minimum standard of healthcare insurance and [[individual mandate|mandating]] that people purchase private healthcare insurance. This is the first time that the Federal government has mandated people to buy insurance, although nearly all states in the union currently mandate the purchase of auto insurance. The legislation also taxes certain very high payout insurance policies (so-called "Cadillac policies") to help finance subsidies for poorer citizens. These will be offered on a sliding scale to people earning less than four times the federal poverty level to enable them to buy health insurance if they are not otherwise covered by their employer.

The issue of concentration of power by the insurance industry has also been a focus of debate as in many states very few large insurers dominate the market. Legislation which would provide a choice of a not-for-profit insurer modeled on Medicare but funded by insurance premiums has been a contentious issue. Much debate surrounded [[Medicare Advantage]] and the profits of insurers selling it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703932904574511090636399788 "Humana's third-quarter earnings rose 65% amid improved margins at its government segment and prior-year investment losses"] ''Wall Street Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain proposals include a choice of a not-for-profit insurer modeled on Medicare (sometimes called the "government option"). Democratic legislators have largely supported the proposed reform efforts, while Republicans have criticized the government option or expanded regulation of healthcare.

The [[GAO]] reported in 2002 (using 2000 data) that: "The [[median]] number of licensed carriers in the small group market per state was 28, with a range from 4 in Hawaii to 77 in Indiana. The median market share of the largest carrier was about 33 percent, with a range from about 14 percent in Texas to about 89 percent in North Dakota."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d02536r.pdf GAO-Letter to Honorable Christopher "Kit" Bond-March 2002] The letter states "A carrier is generally an entity (either an insurer or managed healthcare plan) that bears the risk for
and administers a range of health benefit offerings."&lt;/ref&gt;

The GAO reported in 2008 (using 2007 data for the most part) that: "The median number of licensed carriers in the small group market per state was 27. The median market share of the largest carrier in the small group market was about 47%, with a range from about 21% in Arizona to about 96% in Alabama.

[[File:Compensation - Gross and Net of Health Insurance Premiums.png|thumb|300px|Health insurance premiums paid on behalf of workers are increasingly offsetting compensation]]

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] has also described how the tax treatment of insurance premiums may affect behavior:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/93xx/doc9385/06-17-LTBO_Testimony.pdf|title=CBO-Testimony to Senate Finance Committee-June 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|One factor perpetuating inefficiencies in health care is a lack of clarity regarding the cost of health insurance and who bears that cost, especially employment-based health insurance. Employers’ payments for employment-based health insurance and nearly all payments by employees for that insurance are excluded from individual income and payroll taxes. Although both theory and evidence suggest that workers ultimately finance their employment-based insurance through lower take-home pay, the cost is not evident to many workers.... If transparency increases and workers see how much their income is being reduced for employers’ contributions and what those contributions are paying for, there might be a broader change in cost-consciousness that shifts demand.}}

In November 2009, ''[[The Economist]]'' estimated that taxing employer-provided health insurance (which is presently exempt from tax) would add $215 billion per year to federal tax revenue during the 2013–2014 periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14903024 |title=The Economist-Stemming the Tide|work=The Economist  |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |date=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Singer]] wrote in the ''[[New York Times]]'' that the current exclusion of insurance premiums from compensation represents a $200 billion subsidy for the private insurance industry and that it would likely not exist without it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/magazine/19healthcare-t.html|title=NYT-Singer-Why We Must Ration Healthcare-July 15, 2009 | work=The New York Times | date=July 19, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, taxpayers might be more inclined to change behavior or the system itself if they were paying $200 billion more in taxes each year related to health insurance. To put this amount in perspective, the federal government collected $1,146 billion in income taxes in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/100xx/doc10014/March2009_HistoricalTables.pdf|title=CBO Historical Tables|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; so $200 billion represents a 17.5% increase in the effective tax rate.

===Independent advisory panels===
President Obama has proposed an "Independent Medicare Advisory Panel" (IMAC) to make recommendations on Medicare reimbursement policy and other reforms. Comparative effectiveness research would be one of many tools used by the IMAC. The IMAC concept was endorsed in a letter from several prominent healthcare policy experts, as summarized by [[Office of Management and Budget|OMB]] Director [[Peter Orszag]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/blog/09/08/04/AnotherlookatIMAC/|title=OMB Director Orszag-IMAC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504045040/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/blog/09/08/04/AnotherlookatIMAC|archivedate=May 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Their support of the IMAC proposal underscores what most serious health analysts have recognized for some time: that moving toward a health system emphasizing quality rather than quantity will require continual effort, and that a key objective of legislation should be to put in place structures (like the IMAC) that facilitate such change over time. And ultimately, without a structure in place to help contain costs over the long term as the health market evolves, nothing else we do in fiscal policy will matter much, because eventually rising health care costs will overwhelm the federal budget.}}

Both Mayo Clinic CEO Dr. Denis Cortese and surgeon/author Atul Gawande have argued that such panel(s) will be critical to reform of the delivery system and improving value. ''Washington Post'' columnist [[David Ignatius]] has also recommended that President Obama engage someone like Cortese to have a more active role in driving reform efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/19/AR2009081902261.html|title=Paging Dr. Reform | work=The Washington Post | first=David | last=Ignatius | date=August 20, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lowering obesity===
Preventing obesity and overweight conditions presents a significant opportunity to reduce costs. The [[Centers for Disease Control]] reported that approximately 9% of healthcare costs in 1998 were attributable to overweight and obesity, or as much as $93 billion in 2002 dollars. Nearly half of these costs were paid for by the government via Medicare or Medicaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/causes/economics.html |title=CDC Home Page-Economic Consequences of Overweight and Obesity-Retrieved October 6, 2009 |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=March 28, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2008 the CDC estimated these costs had nearly doubled to $147 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mckay |first=Betsy |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204563304574314794089897258 |title=WSJ-Cost of Treating Obesity Soars |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=July 28, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC identified a series of expensive conditions more likely to occur due to obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/causes/health.html |title=Health Consequences of Obesity and Overweight |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC released a series of strategies to prevent obesity and overweight, including: making healthy foods and beverages more available; supporting healthy food choices; encouraging kids to be more active; and creating safe communities to support physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20090727/obestiy-costs-us-147-billion-dollars-a-year |title=Obesity Costs U.S. $147 billion per year |publisher=Webmd.com |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwR/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5807a1.htm |title=Recommended Community Strategies and Measurements to Prevent Obesity in the U.S. | date=July 24, 2009 |publisher=Cdc.gov |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 26% of U.S. adults in 2007 were obese, versus 24% in 2005.

===Rationing of care===
[[Healthcare rationing in the United States|Healthcare rationing]] may refer to the restriction of medical care service delivery based on any number of objective or subjective criteria. Republican [[Newt Gingrich]] argued that the reform plans supported by President Obama expand the control of government over healthcare decisions, which he referred to as a type of healthcare rationing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-gingrich16-2009aug16,0,3301006.story|author= Newt Gingrich|title=Healthcare Rationing – Real Scary | work=Los Angeles Times | date=August 16, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama has argued that U.S. healthcare is already rationed, based on income, type of employment, and medical [[pre-existing condition]]s, with nearly 46 million uninsured. He argued that millions of Americans are denied coverage or face higher premiums as a result of medical pre-existing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/opinion/16obama.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ref=opinion|title=President Obama – Why We Need Healthcare Reform | work=The New York Times | date=August 16, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Singer]] wrote in the ''New York Times'' in July 2009 that healthcare is rationed in the United States and argued for improved rationing processes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/magazine/19healthcare-t.html|author=Peter Singer|title=Why We Must Ration Healthcare | work=The New York Times | date=July 19, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Health care is a scarce resource, and all scarce resources are rationed in one way or another. In the United States, most healthcare is privately financed, and so most rationing is by price: you get what you, or your employer, can afford to insure you for...Rationing healthcare means getting value for the billions we are spending by setting limits on which treatments should be paid for from the public purse. If we ration we won’t be writing blank checks to pharmaceutical companies for their patented drugs, nor paying for whatever procedures doctors choose to recommend. When public funds subsidize healthcare or provide it directly, it is crazy not to try to get value for money. The debate over healthcare reform in the United States should start from the premise that some form of healthcare rationing is both inescapable and desirable. Then we can ask, What is the best way to do it?"}}

According to PolitiFact, private health insurance companies already ration healthcare by income, by denying health insurance to those with pre-existing conditions and by caps on health insurance payments. Rationing exists now, and will continue to exist with or without healthcare reform.&lt;ref name="PolitiFactRationing"&gt;PolitiFact, [http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/25/howard-dean/rationing-health-care-reform/ There's rationing in health care now, and there still would be under reform bill]&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Leonhardt]] also wrote in the ''New York Times'' in June 2009 that rationing is a part of economic reality: "The choice isn’t between rationing and not rationing. It’s between rationing well and rationing badly. Given that the United States devotes far more of its economy to healthcare than other rich countries, and gets worse results by many measures, it’s hard to argue that we are now rationing very rationally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/business/economy/17leonhardt.html|author=David Leonhardt|title=Healthcare Rationing Rhetoric Overlooks Reality | work=The New York Times | date=June 17, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palin's [[death panel]] remarks were based on the ideas of [[Betsy McCaughey]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Dwyer, August 25, 2009. ''The New York Times'', [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/26/nyregion/26about.html "Distortions on Health Bill, Homegrown"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PolitiFactLieoftheYear"&gt;Angie Drobnic Holan, [http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2009/dec/18/politifact-lie-year-death-panels/ PolitiFact's Lie of the Year].  Accessed August 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  During 2009, former Alaska Governor [[Sarah Palin]] wrote against alleged rationing, referring to what by her interpretation was a "downright evil" "death panel" in current reform legislation known as [[America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009#Reimbursement for counseling about living wills|H.R. 3200 Section 1233]].&lt;ref name="PolitiFactLieoftheYear" /&gt;  However, Palin supported similar end of life discussion and advance directives for patients in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.state.ak.us/archive.php?id=1094&amp;type=6|title=Office of the Governor of Alaska – Healthcare Decisions Day |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105041359/http://gov.state.ak.us/archive.php?id=1094&amp;type=6 |archivedate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders of the plan indicated that the proposed legislation [[H.R. 3200]] would allow Medicare for the first time to cover patient-doctor consultations about end-of-life planning, including discussions about drawing up a living will or planning hospice treatment. Patients could seek out such advice on their own, but would not be required to. The provision would limit Medicare coverage to one consultation every five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/08/08/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry5226795.shtml|title=Palin Weighs In On Healthcare Reform|publisher= CBS News | first=Dan | last=Farber | date=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rep.

The federal requirement that hospitals help patients with things like living wills began when Republican [[George H. W. Bush]] was President. Section 1233 merely allows doctors to be paid for their time.&lt;ref name="Palin is wrong"/&gt; However, an NBC poll indicates that as of August, 2009, 45% of Americans believed in the death panel story.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Murray, August 18, 2009, NBC, [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32464936/ns/politics-white_house/ "Americans still skeptical about Obama’s plans"]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' columnist Christopher Beam used the term "deathers" to refer to those who believed rationing and euthanasia would become likely for senior citizens. ''The [[Rachel Maddow]] Show'' aired a program called "Obama and the Deathers" in which Maddow discussed conspiracy theories that included "a secret plot to kill old people." [[Daily Kos]] and other web sites had used the term for about a week before [[Hari Sevugan]], national spokesman for the [[Democratic National Committee]], sent out an email with the subject line "Murkowski: Deathers 'Lying' 'Inciting Fear.'" The message included an article about a [[Town hall meeting|town hall]] statement by [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Lisa Murkowski]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from Alaska, that no version of healthcare reform included "death panels".

Sevugan explained the term "deathers" to [[Patricia Murphy (journalist)|Patricia Murphy]], who used to write a ''[[Politics Daily]]'' column called "The Capitolist":

&lt;blockquote&gt;By "deather," I mean an opponent of change who is knowingly spreading false information regarding the existence of an alleged "death panel" in health insurance reform plans despite the fact the claim has been repeatedly and unequivocally debunked by independent fact-checking organizations. Like "[[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|birthers]]", "deathers" are shamefully lying and trafficking in scurrilous rumors to incite fear and achieve their stated political objective of derailing the president of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/08/13/democrats-shift-criticism-from-birthers-to-deathers/|title=Democrats Shift Criticism From 'Birthers' to 'Deathers'|first=Patricia| last=Murphy|work=Politics Daily|date=August 13, 2009|accessdate=October 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Others, such as former Republican Secretary of Commerce [[Peter George Peterson|Peter G. Peterson]], have indicated that some form of rationing is inevitable and desirable considering the state of U.S. finances and the trillions of dollars of unfunded Medicare liabilities. He estimated that 25–33% of healthcare services are provided to those in the last months or year of life and advocated restrictions in cases where quality of life cannot be improved. He also recommended that a budget be established for government healthcare expenses, through establishing spending caps and pay-as-you-go rules that require tax increases for any incremental spending. He has indicated that a combination of tax increases and spending cuts will be required. All of these issues would be addressed under the aegis of a fiscal reform commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10443|title=Peter G.

===Medical malpractice costs and limits on redress (tort)===
Critics have argued that [[medical malpractice]] costs are significant and should be addressed via [[tort reform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2009/08/06/the_high_cost_of_medical_malpractice_97346.html|title=RCP-Roth-The High Cost of Medical Malpractice-August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, a [[Hearst Newspapers]] investigation concluded that up to 200,000 people per year die from [[medical errors]] and infections in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/deadbymistake/6669310.html |website=Chron.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711151830/http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/deadbymistake/6669310.html |archivedate=2011-07-11 |title=Health care bills sidestep medical errors issue|date=2009-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  None of the three major bills under consideration lower recoverable damages in [[tort]] suits. Medical malpractice, such as doctor errors resulting in harm to patients, has several direct and indirect costs:
* jury awards to injured;
* [[workers' compensation]];
* reduced worker productivity as a result of injury;
* pain and suffering of the injured;

How much these costs are is a matter of debate. Some have argued that [[malpractice]] lawsuits are a major driver of medical costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/30/AR2009073002816.html|title=Health Reform's Taboo Topic|author=Philip K. Howard|date=July 31, 2009 | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the direct cost of malpractice suits amounts to only about 0.5% of all healthcare spending, and a 2006 Harvard study showed that over 90% of the malpractice suits examined contained evidence of injury to the patient and that [[Frivolous lawsuit|frivolous suits]] were generally readily [[Involuntary dismissal|dismissed]] by the courts.&lt;ref name="slate11"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2145400/|title=The Medical Malpractice Myth|journal=Slate|date=2006-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 study estimated the cost around 0.2%, and in 2009 insurer WellPoint Inc. said "liability wasn’t driving premiums."&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=az9qxQZNmf0o|title=Bloomberg-Malpractice Lawsuits are Red Herring in Obama Plan | date=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counting both direct and indirect costs, other studies estimate the total cost of malpractice "is linked to" between 5% and 10% of total U.S. medical costs.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; A 2004 report by the Congressional Budget Office put medical malpractice costs at 2% of U.S. health spending and "even significant reductions" would do little to reduce the growth of health care expenses.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

Conservative columnist [[Charles Krauthammer]] argued that between $60–200 billion per year could be saved through tort reform.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Physician and former Democratic National Committee Chairman [[Howard Dean]] explained why tort reform is not part of the bills under consideration: "When you go to pass a really enormous bill like that, the more stuff you put it in it, the more enemies you make, right?...And the reason tort reform is not on the bill is because the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers in addition to everybody else they were taking on. That is the plain and simple truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/08/27/roundtable_on_health_care_reforms_costs_98082.html|title=RCP-Roundtable on Health Reform Costs|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even successful tort reform might not lead to lower aggregate liability: for example, medical commentators have argued that the current contingent fee system skews litigation towards high-value cases while ignoring meritorious small cases; aligning litigation more closely with merit might thus increase the number of small awards, offsetting any reduction in large awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/503853 |title=The Medical Malpractice Insurance Crisis, Again |publisher=Medscape.com |accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A New York study found that only 1.5% of hospital negligence led to claims; moreover, the CBO observed that "health care providers are generally not exposed to the financial cost of their own malpractice risk because they carry liability insurance, and the premiums for that insurance do not reflect the records or practice styles of individual providers but more-general factors such as location and medical specialty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=4968&amp;type=0|title=CBO – Limiting Tort Liability for Medical Malpractice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that total liability is small relative to the amount doctors pay in malpractice insurance premiums, alternative mechanisms have been proposed to reform malpractice insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physiciansnews.com/law/1202roggenbaum.html|title=Alternative malpractice insurance mechanisms |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928231343/http://www.physiciansnews.com/law/1202roggenbaum.html |archivedate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Addressing the shortage of doctors, nurses and hospital capacity===
The U.S. is facing shortages of doctors and nurses that are projected to grow worse as America ages, which may drive up the price of these services. Writing in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', cardiologist Arthur Feldman cited various studies that indicate the U.S. is facing a "critical" shortage of doctors, including an estimated 1,300 general surgeons by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/04/AR2009090402274.html|title=Feldman – Ten Things I Hate About Healthcare Reform | work=The Washington Post | date=September 6, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Academy of Family Physicians predicts a shortage of 40,000 primary care doctors (including family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics/gynecology) by 2020. The number of medical students choosing the primary care specialty has dropped by 52% since 1997. Currently, only 2% of medical school graduates choose primary care as a career. An amendment to the Senate health bill includes $2 billion in funds over 10 years to create 2,000 new residency training slots geared toward primary care medicine and general surgery. Writing in Forbes, a physician argued that this is a "tiny band-aid at best," advocating full loan repayments and guaranteed positions upon graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/12/04/doctors-medical-health-reform-senate-opinions-contributors-marc-siegel.html |title=The Doctor Drought |author=Marc Siegel |work=Forbes |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |date=December 4, 2009 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130123083057/http://www.forbes.com/2009/12/04/doctors-medical-health-reform-senate-opinions-contributors-marc-siegel.html |archivedate=January 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. had 2.4 doctors per 1,000 people in 2002, ranking 52nd. Germany and France had approximately 3.4 and ranked in the top 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_phy_per_1000_peo-physicians-per-1-000-people |title=Retrieved December 4, 2009 |publisher=Nationmaster.com |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OECD average in 2008 was 3.1 doctors per 1,000 people, while the U.S. had 2.4.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/02/health-care-costs-opinions-columnists-reform.html |author=Bruce Bartlett|title=Health Care Costs &amp; Reform |work=Forbes |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |date=July 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Association of Colleges of Nurses cited studies estimating that a shortage of registered nurses would reach 230,000 by 2025 as America ages, with over 135,000 open positions during 2007. An additional 30% more nurses would have to graduate annually to keep up with demand. A study by Price Waterhouse advanced several strategies for addressing the nursing shortage, including developing more public-private partnerships, federal and state-level grants for nursing students and educators, creating healthy work environments, using technology as a training tool, and designing more flexible roles for advanced practice nurses given their increased use as primary care providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aacn.nche.edu/Media/FactSheets/NursingShortage.htm|title=American Association of Colleges of Nurses-Fact Sheet-Retrieved September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the U.S. also does not measure favorably vs. OECD countries in terms of acute care hospital beds. Only four OECD countries have fewer acute care hospital beds per capita than the U.S, which has 2.7 per 1,000 population versus an OECD average of 3.8. Japan has 8.2 acute care beds per 1,000 population.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;

===Addressing Medicare fraud===
The [[Office of Management and Budget]] reported that $54 billion in "improper payments" were made to Medicare ($24B), Medicaid ($18B) and Medicaid Advantage ($12B) during [[Fiscal year#United States|FY]] 2009. This was 9.4% of the $573 billion spent in these categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/11/18/government.improper.payments/index.html|format=URL|title=White House Reports Billions of Improper Payments in 2009 |publisher=CNN  |accessdate=November 18, 2009 | date=November 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government Accountability Office lists Medicare as a "high-risk" government program due to its vulnerability to improper payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09271.pdf|format=PDF|title="High-Risk Series: An Update" U.S. Government Accountability Office, January 2009 (PDF)   | accessdate=November 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Government Accountability Office|U.S. Government Accountability Office]], [http://www.gao.gov/docdblite/summary.php?rptno=GAO-05-656&amp;accno=A37738 Medicare: More Effective Screening and Stronger Enrollment Standards Needed for Medical Equipment Suppliers], GAO-05-656 September 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d02546.pdf Medicare Fraud and Abuse: DOJ Continues to Promote Compliance with False Claims Act Guidance], GAO Report to Congressional Committees, April 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Fewer than 5% of Medicare claims are audited.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;Carrie Johnson, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/12/AR2008061203915.html "Medical Fraud a Growing Problem: Medicare Pays Most Claims Without Review,"] The [[Washington Post]], June 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Medicare fraud accounts for an estimated $60 billion in Medicare payments each year, and "has become one of, if not the most profitable, crimes in America."&lt;ref name="Rosen &amp; Bach 10-25-2009"/&gt; Criminals set up phony companies, then invoice Medicare for fraudulent services provided to valid Medicare patients who never receive the services.

===Single-payer payment system===
[[File:Single Payer Protester.JPG|thumb|Costumed supporter of single-payer at an April 2009 protest in New York City.]]
{{See also|Single-payer health care#United States|United States National Health Care Act}}

In a single payer system the government or a government regulated non-profit agency channels health care payments to collect premiums and settle the bills of medical providers, instead of for-profit insurance companies. Many countries use single-payer systems to cover all their citizens.

The over 1,300 U.S. health insurance companies have different forms and processes for billing and reimbursement, requiring high costs on the part of service providers (mainly doctors and hospitals) to process payments. For example, the Cleveland Clinic, considered a low-cost, best-practices hospital system, has 1,400 billing clerks to support 2,000 doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/224585 |title=The Hospital That Could Cure Healthcare-December 7, 2009 |work=Newsweek |date=November 26, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419123728/http://www.newsweek.com/id/224585 |archivedate=April 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the insurance companies have their own overhead functions and profit margins, much of which could be eliminated with a single payer system.  Economist Paul Krugman estimated in 2005 that converting from the current private insurance system to a single-payer system would save $200 billion per year, primarily via insurance company overhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Krugman |first=Paul |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/13/opinion/13krugman.html |title=One Nation, Uninsured |work=The New York Times |date=June 13, 2005 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One advocacy group estimated savings as high as $400 billion annually for 2009 and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnhp.org/facts/single-payer-resources |title=PNHP-Single Payer |publisher=Pnhp.org |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. system is often compared with that of its northern neighbor, Canada (see [[Canadian and American health care systems compared]]). Canada's system is largely publicly funded. In 2006, Americans spent an estimated US$6,714 per capita on health care, while Canadians spent US$3,678.&lt;ref name="OECD Canada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/33/38979719.pdf|title=OECD Health Data 2008: How Does Canada Compare|format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616225257/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/33/38979719.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amounted to 15% percent of U.S. GDP in that year, while Canada spent 10%. A study by Harvard Medical School and the Canadian Institute for Health Information determined that some 31% of U.S. health care dollars (more than $1,000 per person per year) went to health care administrative costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnhp.org/publications/nejmadmin.pdf "Costs of Health Administration in the U.S. and Canada." Woolhandler, et al., NEJM 349(8) Sept. 21, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates argue that shifting the U.S. to a single-payer health care system would provide universal coverage, give patients free choice of providers and hospitals, and guarantee comprehensive coverage and equal access for all medically necessary procedures, without increasing overall spending. Shifting to a single-payer system would also eliminate oversight by managed care reviewers, removing a potential impediment to the doctor-patient relationship.&lt;ref name="PNHP"&gt;Physicians for a National Health Program. [http://www.pnhp.org/facts/what_is_single_payer.php "What is Single Payer?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although studies indicate Democrats tend to be more supportive of a single-payer system than Republicans, none of the reform bills debated in the U.S. Congress when the Democrats had a majority from 2007–2010, included proposals to implement a single payer health care system. Advocates argue that the largest obstacle to single-payer, universal system in the U.S. is a lack of political will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnhp.org/news/2007/february/timid_ideas_wont_fi.php Timid ideas will not fix health mess].

===Privatize Medicare with a voucher system===
{{main|The Path to Prosperity}}

Rep. [[Paul Ryan (politician)|Paul Ryan]] (R) has proposed the ''Roadmap for America's Future'', which is a series of budgetary reforms. His January 2010 version of the plan includes the transition of Medicare to a voucher system, meaning individuals would receive a voucher which could be used to purchase health insurance in the private market. This would not affect those near retirement or currently enrolled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/ |title=Republican Website-Roadmap for America's Future |publisher=Roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov |date=January 26, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130103958/http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/ |archivedate=January 30, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of graphs and charts summarizing the impact of the plan are included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/plan/charts.htm |title=Roadmap for America's Future-Charts &amp; Graphs-February 2010 |publisher=Roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219200328/http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/Plan/Charts.htm |archivedate=December 19, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economists have both praised and criticized particular features of the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/12/AR2010021202382.html?hpid=opinionsbox1 |title=Robert Samuelson-Paul Ryan's Lonely Challenge-February 2010 |work=The Washington Post |date=February 12, 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/02/11/cut-spending-taxes-budget-medicare-paul-ryan-opinions-columnists-bruce-bartlett.html |title=Forbes-Bartlett-Paul Ryan's Budgetary Holy Grail |work=Forbes |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |date=February 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBO also partially scored the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/108xx/doc10851/01-27-Ryan-Roadmap-Letter.pdf |title=CBO-Ryan Roadmap Letter|date=January 2010 |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congressional Proposals for Health Care Reform==
{{update|section|date=July 2012}}

On November 7, 2009, the House passed their version of a health insurance reform bill, the [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]], 220–215, but this did not become law.

On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://democrats.senate.gov/reform/patient-protection-affordable-care-act.pdf |title=Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/12/24/health.care/index.html |title=CNN-Senate Passes Healthcare Bill-December 24, 2009 |publisher=CNN |date=December 24, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama signed this into law in March 2010.

Republicans continue to claim that they had a workable bill to extend coverage to all Americans and not cost the taxpayer anything, though nothing has been publicly presented to back the claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/30/health/policy/30check.html?hpw | work=The New York Times | title=Searching for Some Light Amid the Heat | first=David M. | last=Herszenhorn | date=January 29, 2010 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Empowering Patients First Act]] which was proposed as a replacing amendment to the Senate Bill during the bill mark-up. However, this alternative bill was rejected by the Senate Finance Committee. The Congressional Budget Office said that it would not reduce the percentage of working age people who do not have insurance over the next 10 years, and that it estimated it would encourage health insurers to reduce rather than increase insurance coverage as it would remove mandated coverage rules that currently apply in some states. This bill would have given the insurance industry greater access to government funds through new insurance subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbo.gov/ftpdocs/107xx/doc10705/hr3962amendmentBoehner.pdf |title=CBO.gov |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not have any taxation provisions and though it would reduce the deficit over 10 years by $18 billion, this was a considerably smaller deficit reduction than either the House or the Senate bills.

===Similarities between the House and Senate Bills===
The two bills are similar in a number of ways.

* Establish [[health insurance exchange]]s making easier price and coverage comparisons and purchasing for people and small businesses buying health care coverage
* Prevent insurers selling in the exchange insurance policies that do not meet minimum coverage standards
* Prevent insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions
* Prevent sex discrimination by insurers (especially the current discrimination against women) in setting premiums
* Limit age discrimination by insurers when setting policy premiums
* Restrict the ability of insurers to rescind policies they have been collecting premiums on
* Require insurers to cover adult children up to their mid twenties as part of family coverage
* Expand Medicaid eligibility up the income ladder (to 133% of the poverty line in the Senate bill and 150% in the House bill)
* Offer tax credits to certain small businesses (under 25 workers) who provide employees with health insurance
* Impose a penalty on employers who do not offer health insurance to their workers
* Impose a penalty on individuals who do not have health insurance (except American Indians (currently covered by the Indian Health Service), people with religious objections and people who can show financial hardship)
* Provide health insurance assistance subsidies for those earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level that must buy insurance for themselves
* Offer a new voluntary long-term care insurance program
* Pay for new spending, in part, through cutting over-generous funding (under existing law) given to private insurers that sell privatised health care plans to seniors (so called [[Medicare Advantage]] plans), slowing the growth of Medicare provider payments {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}, reducing Medicare and Medicaid drug prices {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}, cutting other Medicare and Medicaid spending through better reward structures, and raising taxes on very generous health care packages (typically offered to senior executives) and penalties on larger firms not providing their employees with health care coverage and certain persons who do not buy health insurance.
* Impose a $2,500 limit on contributions to a flexible spending account (FSAs), pre-tax health benefits, to pay for health care reform costs.

===Differences in the House and Senate Bills===
The biggest difference between the bills, currently, is in how they are financed. In addition to the items listed in the above bullet point, the House relies mainly on a surtax on income above $500,000 ($1 million for families). The Senate, meanwhile, relies largely on an "excise tax" for high cost '[[Cadillac insurance plan|Cadillac]]' insurance plans, as well as an increase in the Medicare payroll tax for high earners.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/st_healthcareproposals_20090912.html |title=Wallstreet Journal online |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=March 22, 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most economists believe the excise tax to be best of the three revenue raisers above, since (due to health care cost growth) it would grow fast enough to more than keep up with new coverage costs, and it would help to put downward pressure on overall health care cost growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crfb.org/blogs/understanding-health-insurance-excise-tax |title=Understanding the Health Insurance Excise Tax &amp;#124; Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget |publisher=Crfb.org |accessdate=2013-10-10|date=2009-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crfb.org/blogs/taxing-health-care-decisions |title=Taxing Health Care Decisions &amp;#124; Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget |publisher=Crfb.org |accessdate=2013-10-10|date=2009-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, the House bill's [[health insurance mandate|insurance mandate]] has been described as "an economic assault on the young" by, for example, [[Robert J. Samuelson]] for [[The Washington Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/22/AR2009112201237.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Robert J. Samuelson on the health bill's burdens for the young | date=November 23, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Differences in how each chamber determines subsidies====
&lt;!--Subsidy information is directly from the bills--&gt;
[[File:Percentage of income allotted to pay for health insurance vs. federal poverty level for house and senate.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=A graphic that demonstrates how the subsidies are more generous for those closer to the poverty line and drop off as a family's distance from the poverty line increases. The rate at which the subsidy falls off decreases with increased distance from the poverty line. The curve representative of the "house bill" is concave and has a negative second derivative. The curve representative of the "senate bill" is linear from 100% FPL to 300% FPL and then flattens out at 9.8% of annual income until 400% FPL.|The relationship between a family's [[federal poverty level|poverty level]] and the percentage of their income that is allotted to pay for health insurance. Note that the Senate Bill provides for Medicaid coverage up to 133% of the federal poverty level while the House Bill provides for Medicaid coverage up to 150% of the federal poverty level. Adapted from the texts of the House Bill and Senate Bill.]]
How each bill determines subsidies also differs. Each bill subsidizes the cost of the premium and the out-of-pocket costs but are more or less generous based on the relationship of the family's income to the federal poverty level.

The amount of the subsidy given to a family to cover the cost of a premium is calculated using a formula that includes the family's income relative to the federal poverty level. The federal poverty level is related to a determined percentage that defines how much of that family's income can be put towards a health insurance premium. For instance, under the House Bill, a family at 200% of the federal poverty level will spend no more than 5.5% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. Under the Senate Bill, the same family would spend no more than 6.3% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. The difference between the family's maximum contribution to health insurance premiums and the cost of the health insurance premium is paid for by the federal government.
To understand how each bill can affect different poverty levels and incomes, see the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]]'s [http://healthreform.kff.org/SubsidyCalculator.aspx subsidy calculator]

The House plan subsidizes the cost of the plan and out-of-pocket expenses.
The cost of the plan is subsidized according to the family's poverty level, decreasing the subsidy as the poverty level approaches 400%.
The out-of-pocket expenses are also subsidized according to the poverty level at the following rates. The out-of-pocket expenses are subsidized initially and are not allowed to exceed a particular amount that will rise with the premiums for basic insurance.

The cost of the plan is subsidized according to the family's poverty level, decreasing the subsidy as the [[federal poverty level|poverty level]] approaches 400%.

The Senate Bill also seeks to reduce out-of-pocket costs by setting guidelines for how much of the health costs can be shifted to a family within 200% of the poverty line. A family within 150% of the FPL cannot have more than 10% of their health costs incurred as out-of-pocket expenses. A family between 150% and 200% of the FPL cannot have more than 20% of their health costs incurred as out-of-pocket expenses.

&lt;!--I gleaned all of the subsidy information directly from the bills. Feel free to edit it. I'll keep myself posted and notice any chances.--&gt;
The House and Senate bill would differ, somewhat, in their overall impact. The Senate bill would cover an additional 31 million people, at a federal budget cost of nearly $850 billion (not counting unfunded mandates) over ten years, reduce the ten-year deficit by $130 billion, and reduce the deficit in the second decade by around 0.25% of GDP. The House bill, meanwhile, would cover an additional 36 million people, cost roughly $1050 billion in coverage provisions, reduce the ten-year deficit by $138 billion, and slightly reduce the deficit in the second decade.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Commentary on the cost analysis===
It is worth noting that both bills rely on a number of "gimmicks" to get their favorable deficit reduction numbers. For example, both institute a public long-term care insurance known as the CLASS Act – because this insurance has a 5-year vesting period, it will appear to raise revenue in the first decade, even though all the money will need to be paid back. If the CLASS Act is subtracted from the bills, the Senate bill would reduce the deficit by $57 billion over ten years, and the House by $37 billion. In addition to the CLASS Act, neither bill accounts for the costs of updating Medicare physician payments, even though the House [http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/712775 did so on a deficit-financed basis] shortly after passing their health care bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crfb.org/blogs/true-costs-health-reform |title=The True Costs of Health Reform &amp;#124; Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget |publisher=Crfb.org |date=2009-11-20 |accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate bill also begins most provisions a year later than the House bill in order to make costs seem smaller:

Surgeon [[Atul Gawande]] wrote in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that the Senate and House bills passed contain a variety of pilot programs that may have a significant impact on cost and quality over the long-run, although these have not been factored into CBO cost estimates. He stated these pilot programs cover nearly every idea healthcare experts advocate, except malpractice/tort reform. He argued that a trial and error strategy, combined with industry and government partnership, is how the U.S. overcame a similar challenge in the agriculture industry in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gawande |first=Atul |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/12/14/091214fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all |title=Gawande-Testing, Testing-New Yorker-December 2009 |journal=The New Yorker |date=August 1, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lobbying==
[[File:U.S. Insurance Contributions (1990 to 2010).jpg|thumb|right|300px|U.S. insurance health, life, property, and car insurance industry related political contributions from 1990 to 2010]]

The health and insurance sectors gave nearly $170 million to House and Senate members in 2007 and 2008, with 54% going to Democrats, according to data compiled by the [[Center for Responsive Politics]]. The shift in parties was even more pronounced during the first three months of 2009, when Democrats collected 60% of the $5.4 million donated by health care companies and their employees, the data show. Lawmakers that chair key committees have been leading recipients, some of whom received over $1.0 million in contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/20/AR2009072003363.html?hpid=topnews&amp;sid=ST2009072003679|title=Washington Post-Dan Eggen-Industry Cash Flowed to Drafters of Reform-July 2009 | work=The Washington Post | date=July 21, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matt Taibbi]] wrote in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that President Obama and key senators who have advocated single-payer systems in the past are unwilling to face the insurance companies and their powerful lobbying efforts. Key politicians on the Senate Finance Committee involved in crafting legislation have received over $2 million in campaign contributions from the healthcare industry. Several of the firms invited to testify at the hearings sent lobbyists that had formerly worked for Senator [[Max Baucus]], the chair of the committee. Mr. Baucus stated in February 2009 that: "There may come a time when we can push for single-payer. At this time, it's not going to get to first base in Congress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/29988909/sick_and_wrong|title=Taibbi-Rolling Stone-Sick and Wrong-September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George McGovern]] wrote that significant campaign funds were given to the chairman and ranking minority member of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over health care legislation: "Chairman Max Baucus of Montana, a Democrat, and his political action committee have received nearly $4 million from the health-care lobby since 2003. The ranking Republican, Charles Grassley of Iowa, has received more than $2 million. It's a mistake for one politician to judge the personal motives of another. But Sens. Baucus and Grassley are firm opponents of the single-payer system, as are other highly placed members of Congress who have been generously rewarded by the insurance lobby."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/11/AR2009091102406.html|title=McGovern Op Ed-Washington Post-September 2009 | work=The Washington Post | first=George S. | last=McGovern | date=September 13, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate about political organizing methods==
Much of the coverage of the debate has involved how the different sides are competing to express their views, rather than the specific reform proposals. The health care reform debate in the United States has been influenced by the [[Tea Party protests|Tea Party protest phenomenon]], with reporters and politicians spending time reacting to it.&lt;ref name="Bowser"&gt;{{cite news|first=Andre|last=Bowser|url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/143354|title=TEA Party protests health care reform plan|work=East Valley Tribune|date=August 22, 2009|accessdate=August 26, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113225803/http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/143354 |archivedate=2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Copeland"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wacotrib.com/news/content/news/stories/2009/08/15/08152009wacteapartyprotest.html?imw=Y|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817171053/http://www.wacotrib.com/news/content/news/stories/2009/08/15/08152009wacteapartyprotest.html?imw=Y|dead-url=yes|archive-date=August 17, 2009|work=Waco Tribune|title=Local Tea Party members protest Obama health care plan at Chet Edwards' Waco office|date=August 15, 2009|first=Mike|last=Copeland|accessdate=August 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=summer/&gt; Supporters of a greater government role in healthcare, such as former insurance [[public relations|PR]] executive [[Wendell Potter]] of the [[Center for Media and Democracy]]- whose funding comes from groups such as the [[Tides Foundation]]-&lt;ref name="financial"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prwatch.org/finances.html | title = Financial Supporters | publisher = [[Center for Media and Democracy]] | accessdate =June 3, 2008 | date = 2004-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the hyperbole generated by this phenomenon is a form of corporate [[astroturfing]], which he says that he used to write for [[CIGNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Wendell Potter]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/08/17/potter.health.insurance/index.html?iref=mpstoryview|title=Commentary: How insurance firms drive debate|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 26, 2009|date=August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of more government involvement, such as Phil Kerpen of [[Americans for Prosperity]]- whose funding comes mainly from the [[Koch Industries]] corporation-&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/secretmoney/outside_groups/americans_for_prosperity/ |title=Secret Money Project |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722142926/http://www.npr.org/blogs/secretmoney/outside_groups/americans_for_prosperity/ |archivedate=2009-07-22 |first=Will |last=Evans |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=October 6, 2008 |accessdate=September 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; counter-argue that those corporations oppose a [[Publicly funded health care|public-plan]], but some try to push for government actions that will unfairly benefit them, such as forcing private companies to buy health insurance for their employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2009/08/12/grass-astrpturf-er/|title=The Grass Is AstroTurf-er on the Other Side|publisher=Fox News|date=August 12, 2009|accessdate=August 26, 2009|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805003136/http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2009/08/12/grass-astrpturf-er/ |archivedate=2011-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Ben Smith (journalist)|Ben Smith]] has referred to mid-2009 as "The Summer of Astroturf" given the organizing and co-ordinating efforts made by various groups on both pro- and anti-reform sides.&lt;ref name=summer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/26312.html|title=The Summer of Astroturf|date=August 21, 2009|publisher=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|author=[[Ben Smith (journalist)|Ben Smith]]|accessdate=August 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments concerning health care reform==
===Liberal arguments===
Some have argued that health care is a fundamental human right. Article 25 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states: "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Judith |last=Asher |url=http://shr.aaas.org/manuals/health/Manual_7.pdf |title=Chapter 2 What is meant by the right to health? |series=''The Right to Health: A Resource Manual for NGOs'' |publisher=AAAS Science and Human Rights Program |date=April 25, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516111639/http://shr.aaas.org/manuals/health/Manual_7.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] advocated a right to medical care in his 1944 proposal for a [[Second Bill of Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Franklin D. Roosevelt |url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/projects/globalrights/econrights/fdr-econbill.html |title=The Economic Bill of Rights |date=January 11, 1944 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225183239/http://www.worldpolicy.org/projects/globalrights/econrights/fdr-econbill.html |archivedate=2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberals were the primary advocates of both [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], which are often targeted as significant expansions of government that has overwhelming satisfaction among beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Medicare beneficiaries rate their medical care: new data from the MCBS (Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey)|journal=Health Care Financ Rev.|author=Adler GS|pmid=10172473|volume=16|issue=4|pmc=4193523|pages=175–87|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama argued during a September 2009 joint session of Congress that the government has a moral responsibility to ensure quality healthcare is available to all citizens. He also referred to a letter from the late Senator [[Ted Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/The-Presidents-Remarks-and-a-Letter-from-Ted/|title=President Obama Healthcare Speech of September 9, 2009|first=Jesse|last=Lee|date=September 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist and ''New York Times'' columnist [[Paul Krugman]] has argued that Republican and conservative strategies in opposing healthcare are based on spite: "At this point, the guiding principle of one of our nation’s two great political parties is spite pure and simple. If Republicans think something might be good for the president, they’re against it – whether or not it’s good for America." He argued that Republican opposition to Medicare savings proposed by the President is "utterly at odds both with the party’s traditions and with what conservatives claim to believe. Think about just how bizarre it is for Republicans to position themselves as the defenders of unrestricted Medicare spending. First of all, the modern G.O.P. considers itself the party of Ronald Reagan – and Reagan was a fierce opponent of Medicare’s creation, warning that it would destroy American freedom. (Honest.) In the 1990s, Newt Gingrich tried to force drastic cuts in Medicare financing. And in recent years, Republicans have repeatedly decried the growth in [[entitlement]] spending – growth that is largely driven by rising health care costs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/05/opinion/05krugman.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=print|author= Paul Krugman |title=The Politics of Spite | work=The New York Times | date=October 5, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservative and libertarian arguments===
Conservatives and libertarians have historically argued for a lesser role of government in healthcare.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

For example, Conservative GOP columnist [[Bill Kristol]] advocated several free-market reforms instead of the Clinton plan during the 1993–1994 period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashbrook.org/publicat/onprin/v2n1/kristol.html|work=Wall Street Journal|author=William Kristol|title=How to Oppose the Health Plan and Why|date=January 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigative reporter and columnist [[John Stossel]] has remarked that "Insurance invites waste. That's a reason health care costs so much, and is often so consumer-unfriendly. In the few areas where there are free markets in health care – such as cosmetic medicine and Lasik eye surgery – customer service is great, and prices continue to drop."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[John Stossel]]|title= Health Insurance Isn't All It's Cracked Up to Be|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/PrescriptionForChange/story?id=2574980&amp;page=1|date=October 16, 2006|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republican Senator and medical doctor [[Tom Coburn]] has stated that the [[Health care in Switzerland|healthcare system in Switzerland]] should serve as a model for U.S. reform. He wrote for ''[[New York Sun]]'' that reform should involve a market-based method transferring health care tax benefits to individuals rather than employers as well as giving individuals extra tax credits to afford more coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/opinion/competition-solves-health-care/72610/|work=[[New York Sun]]|title=Competition Solves Health Care|author=[[Tom Coburn]]|date=March 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[Judd Gregg]] (R) said in an interview regarding the passage of healthcare reform: "Well, in my judgment we’re moving down a path towards... Europeanization of our nation.  And our great uniqueness, what surrounds American exceptionalism, what really drives it is that entrepreneurial individualistic spirit which goes out and takes a risk when nobody else is willing to do it or comes up with an idea that nobody else comes up with and that all gets dampened down the larger and more intrusive government becomes, especially if you follow a European model."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/download/transcript/10928 |title=Charlie Rose-Senator Judd Gregg Interview|date=March 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Horace Meyer Kallen was born on August 11, 1882, in the town of Bernstadt, [[Austrian Silesia]] (now [[Bierutów]], [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship]], [[Poland]])). His parents were Jacob David Kallen, an Orthodox rabbi, and Esther Rebecca Glazier. In 1887, the family emigrated to the United States. Kallen studied philosophy at [[Harvard University]] under [[George Santayana]]; in 1903, he received a BA [[magna cum laude]].&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;

|accessdate=24 January 2018
|publisher=The NY Times
|date=February 17, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

That same year, Kallen was personally hired by future American President [[Woodrow Wilson]], then [[Princeton University]]'s president, to become the first [[Jew]] to ever teach at the university.&lt;ref name=Berg&gt;{{cite book|last=Berg|first=A. Scott|title=Wilson|year=2013|publisher=G.P.

''Dialogue on George Santayana''. New York: Horizon Press (1959) 13-17.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, Kallen received his doctorate and was awarded a Sheldon Travelling Fellowship to study at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Menand]]. ''[[The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America]]''. (New York: Farrar, Staus and Girroux, 2001) p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a lifetime friend of [[Alain Locke]], whom he met at Harvard and who was the first African-American [[Rhodes Scholar]]; and would remain the only one until the 1960s.

He lectured in [[philosophy]] at Harvard from his graduation until 1911, occasionally working as a [[logic]] instructor at [[Clark University|Clark College]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. In 1911, he moved to teach philosophy at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] until 1918, when he was named a professor at [[The New School]] in [[New York City]] as a founding member, where he remained for the rest of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, James (1997).

Chap. 8, Two Men of Science, p. 175, namely [[Harlow Shapley]] and Kallen.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1933, Kallen and his colleague [[Sidney Hook]] were serving on the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]]'s academic freedom committee.&lt;ref&gt;

A [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]], Kallen opposed any oversimplification of philosophical and vital problems. According to Kallen, denying complications and difficulties is to multiply them, as much as to deny reality to evil would aggravate evil. Kallen advanced the ideal that cultural diversity and national pride were compatible with each other and that ethnic and racial diversity strengthened America. His critics pointed out his disingenuousness since, as a Jewish intellectual and member of the [[Zionist Organization of America]], his vision of multicultural America was quite the opposite of his vision of the Jewish state of Israel as a totally Jewish nation. Kallen is credited with coining the term [[cultural pluralism]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

He was acquainted with [[William James]], whose last unfinished book he edited. In 1939 he became acquainted with [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] and became a lifelong friend, informal literary advisor, mentor, and advocate.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;Gilbert, James (1997).

He served on congressional committees on international peace and was a part of many [[think tank]]s and study groups on questions ranging from philosophy and law to labor relations.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Kallen married Rachel Oatman van Arsdale in 1926.&lt;ref name=Gilbert/&gt; He died, age 91, on February 16, 1974, in [[Palm Beach, Florida]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

'''Howard W. Dixon''' (August 4, 1915 – July 30, 2007) was a civil rights [[Lawyer|attorney]] in [[Miami]] between 1955 and 1997. During that time, he was considered an activist for the rights of poor people and minorities. He served as General Counsel for the [[NAACP]] in the ‘50s, was a founding Board Member of the [[Florida Civil Liberties Union]]. He was the founding executive director of Legal Service of Greater Miami, a program that grew out of President [[Lyndon Johnson]]’s 1964 War on Poverty. He served as Executive Director from 1966 to 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Ovalle, David. "Enduring legacy of civil rights." Miami Herald. August 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; After his retirement as a General Master for the Florida Court System in 1987, he served as a full-time volunteer for the Legal Aid Society of Greater Miami, earning him the John Minor Wisdom Public Service and Professionalism Award for Pro Bono Service by the American Bar Association in 1995.

As Executive Director for Legal Services of Greater Miami, led several U.S. Supreme Court victories, including Agrersinger vs. Hamlin and Fuentes vs. Shevin in 1972. The cases allowed for people to have counsel and hearings in specific situations. In 1990, Dixon was awarded the Florida Supreme Court’s highest honor, the Tobias Simon Pro Bono Award.&lt;ref&gt;Elinor J. Brecher. "Activist for the rights of poor people." Miami Herald. August 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, as an attorney for the Florida Civil Liberties Union, Dixon defended the [[Freedom Riders]] in [[Tallahassee, Florida]]. He established legal precedence in the case regarding emergency appeals from the State to the Federal courts. The case became famous in legal circles at that time as a method to remove lawsuits from state to federal jurisdiction when all state remedies have not been exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;Florence Morgenroth. "Organization and Activities of the American Civil Liberties Union in Miami; 1955 - 1966." Thesis submitted to the faculty of the University of Miami. Coral Gables, FL July 1966. pg 102-103&lt;/ref&gt;

Dixon was named in the [[amicus brief]] with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] to the Florida Supreme Court urging reversal for Gideon vs. Wainwright, the case that supported the sixth amendment of the constitution to provide counsel in criminal cases for defendants unable to afford their own attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon vs. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963), CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA. No. 155. Argued January 15, 1963. Decided March 18, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Mauritania}}
'''Human rights in Mauritania''' is generally seen as poor according to international observers, including [[Freedom House]], the [[United States Department of State]], and [[Amnesty International]].

With a July 2012 estimated population of 3.4 million,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mr.html Mauritania, ''The World Factbook'', United States Central Intelligence Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mauritania]] is a highly centralized [[Islamic republic]] with no legal provisions for [[freedom of religion]].

Coming from [[French West Africa|French colonial rule]], Mauritania was ethnically divided between [[Arabic]] speaking [[Berber people|Berber]] tribal confederations of the north and sedentary black populations of the south, many of whom were traditionally bonded communities or [[slavery|enslaved]] individuals. The [[Politics of Mauritania|Mauritanian government]] has a history of discriminating against these [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleurs]] and [[Soninke people]] within its borders. One such example occurred in 1987, when the government imprisoned southerners and threw others out of the army, resulting in the [[Mauritania–Senegal Border War]].

Amnesty International has accused the Mauritania legal system of functioning with a complete disregard of legal procedure, fair trial, or humane imprisonment. Amnesty International also has accused the Mauritanian government of an institutionalized and continuous use of [[torture]] for decades.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr38/009/2008/en/ "Mauritania: Torture at the Heart of the State", Amnesty International, 3 December 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UPR Submission"&gt;[http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/session9/MR/AI_AmnestyInternational_Revised.pdf "Mauritania: Amnesty International submission to the UN Universal Periodic Review", Ninth session of the UPR Working Group, November - December 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the constitution of Mauritania, [[international law]] prevails over domestic Mauritanian law as soon as the international law is published in the Official Gazette.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12805&amp;LangID=E "Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights considers report of Mauritania", ''DisplayNews'', Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 16 November 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Respect for the integrity of the person==

===Arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life===

On 27 September 2011, a gendarme fired on demonstrators in [[Maghama]], reportedly killing one person and wounding eight others. The demonstrators were protesting a national voter registration campaign that they believed would discriminate against Afro-Mauritanians due to an alleged lack of ethnic balance among officials evaluating citizenship. Demonstrators demanded greater Afro-Mauritanian representation and an unbiased citizenship verification procedure. On 27 September, Minister of the Interior [[Mohamed Ould Boilil]] publicly confirmed the reports and declared that the government would not permit disturbances of the peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/one-dead-in-mauritania-protest-over-census-plan "One dead in Mauritania protest over census plan", ''Reuters'', reprinted in ''AlertNet'', 27 September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; There was no reported investigation of the death by the end of 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/186431.pdf ''2011 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Mauritania'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page: 2}}

===Disappearance===

There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances in 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 2}}

===Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment===

The constitution and statutes of Mauritania prohibit these practices, and according to the governmental Commissariat for Human Rights, Humanitarian Action, and Relations with Civil Society, there were no documented cases of torture during 2011. Independent human rights observers, however, stated that security personnel tortured detainees to extract confessions. Torture methods in 2011 and previous years reportedly included kicking, beating, electric shocks, cigarette burns, pulling out of hair, sexual violence, suspension by the arms, shackling in painful positions, and deprivation of sleep and food. One prisoner described to [[Amnesty International]] how he was tortured in the "jaguar position", which consisted of tying the detainee's hands and feet together, suspending him from an iron bar, and hitting and
torturing him while in this position.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 2}}&lt;ref name="UPR Submission"/&gt;{{rp|pages: 1–2}}

====Prison and detention center conditions====

Prison conditions were harsh in 2011, and the government's capacity to administer detention facilities remained poor. There were credible reports of torture, beating, and abuse in police detention centers, several prisons throughout the country, and gendarmerie and military facilities. A new prison facility was opened in [[Aleg]] on 28 November, and another prison facility neared completion in [[Nouadhibou]]. The government, however, failed to allocate sufficient funds for improving prison conditions in the existing facilities during the year, and overcrowding, violence among inmates, and poor medical care in prisons continued. Many prisoners were unable to leave their extremely crowded cells or breathe fresh air for months or years at a time. Sanitation conditions were poor due to the lack of hygienic products such as soap and detergent and prison management's inability to dispose of waste properly. Malnutrition was a more serious problem, affecting vulnerable members of the prison population, particularly foreign inmates, prisoners without familial support, and individuals suffering from untreated diseases. The government did not respond robustly to allegations of inhumane conditions, although some progress was made in improving the quality of health care.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|pages: 2–3}}

Serious overcrowding and a lack of running water contributed to the spread of diseases in 2011. Prisoners with health problems received little or no care, and medical supplies remained insufficient.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 3}}

The holding areas in police stations in 2011 were also reportedly overcrowded, unsanitary, and poorly ventilated.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 3}}

There were no ombudsmen at the prison level in 2011. Regulations allowed the inmates in an institution to choose one of their number to represent them in dealings with management, and inmates occasionally did so during 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 3}}

According to the penitentiary administration directorate in 2011, the women's prison is less crowded and therefore more comfortable than the men's. On the other hand, male guards participated in monitoring female inmates, who risked becoming victims of sexual violence.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 3}}

Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in 2011 continued to denounce overcrowding and long pretrial detention. The large number of pretrial detainees exacerbated [[prison overcrowding]].&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|pages: 3–4}} The detainees were frequently housed with convicted and often dangerous prisoners. As of 19 October, according to Ministry of Justice statistics, the prison population totaled 1,695, of whom 861 were convicts and 834 were unconvicted detainees. On 23 May, authorities removed a reported 13-14 suspected terrorists awaiting trial from Nouakchott Central Prison to an undisclosed location to improve prison security and disrupt illicit activity.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 4}}

Because of poor security and dangerous prisoners sharing cells with less dangerous ones, prisoners lived in a climate of violence in 2011. Some had to pay bribes to other prisoners to avoid being brutalized and harassed.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 4}}

Of the 54 children in detention, 34 were in a segregated courtyard of the Nouakchott Central Prison at end of 2011 after a juvenile detention center in Beyla suffered structural damage. Seventeen were being held in a detention center for the "reception and insertion" of youth in conflict with the law. The center's goal is to facilitate the social reintegration of children and youth. During the year officials released 30 children from this center and monitored their subsequent activities.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 4}}

Women and female minors under 18 years of age were housed together in a separate location from the men and male minors in 2011. Sexual violence reportedly occurred in the women's prison, which employed both male and female guards. Children of female prisoners remained with their mothers or were placed by the Ministry of Justice in the temporary custody of family members.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 4}}

Prisoners had access to visitors in 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 4}} The government permitted prison visits by NGOs, diplomats, and international human rights observers. The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] had access to prisons and conducted multiple prison visits, including visits to terrorism suspects, in accordance with its standard modalities.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|pages: 4–5}} There were reports that police did not inform family members or friends of the location and condition of detainees in a timely manner, preventing them from receiving adequate food.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 5}}

There were no reports in 2011 that men were denied the right to observe Muslim prayer obligations individually, but the penitentiary administration confirmed that inmates did not have regular access to imams.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 4}}

===Arbitrary arrest or detention===

The constitution and statutes of Mauritania prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, but authorities in 2011 did not observe these prohibitions. In some cases, authorities arbitrarily arrested and detained protesters and journalists.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 5}}

Human rights and other observers accused the government of exceeding the legal limits for pretrial detention in 2011. Security forces at times arrested demonstrators engaged in sit-ins, marches, or rallies, and held them longer than the regulations allow. On 29 September, the media reported that following a violent protest in [[Nouakchott]] against the national registration initiative, security forces entered private residences without warrants and arrested approximately 20 individuals.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 5}}

By law, a minor may not be held for more than six months while awaiting trial. Nevertheless, there were reports in 2011 that a large number of individuals, including minors, remained in pretrial detention for extended periods due to judicial ineptitude.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 6}}

====Role of the police and security apparatus====

The National Police, under the Ministry of the Interior, are responsible for law enforcement and maintaining order in urban areas. The National Guard, also under the Ministry of the Interior, performs limited police functions in keeping with its peacetime role as security support at government facilities. The National Guard may also be called on by regional authorities to restore civil order during large-scale disturbances such as rioting. The gendarmerie, a specialized paramilitary group under the Ministry of Defense, is responsible for maintaining civil order within and outside of metropolitan areas, as well as providing law enforcement services in rural areas. On 11 October 2011, a new police force, the General Group for Road Safety, began operations under the Ministry of the Interior.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 6}}

The police were poorly paid, trained, and equipped in 2011. Corruption and impunity were serious problems.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 6}}

The government rarely held security officials accountable or prosecuted them for abuses in 2011. The Ethics Police operates as an internal affairs division and as a mechanism to investigate security force abuses. In practice, this unit did not publicly review security force abuses.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 6}}

====Arrest procedures and treatment while in detention====

The application of constitutional safeguards continued to vary widely from case to case in 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 6}}

The law requires duly authorized arrest warrants, but they were not commonly used in 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 6}}

The law requires that, in most cases, courts review the legality of a person's detention within 48 hours of arrest. Police may extend the period for an additional 48 hours, and a prosecutor or court can detain persons for up to 15 days in national security cases. Authorities generally respected the two-week deadline for formally arraigning or releasing terrorism suspects in national security cases.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|pages: 6–7}}

Only after the prosecutor submits charges does a suspect have the right to contact an attorney. By law, indigent defendants are entitled to attorneys at state expense, but in practice attorneys were not provided in 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 7}}

There was a bail system in 2011, but sometimes judges arbitrarily refused lawyers' requests for bail or set inordinately high bail amounts.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 7}}

=====Pretrial detention=====

In 2011, lawyers highlighted the lengthy incarceration of detainees and delays in organizing court hearings, but no statistics on the average length of detention or length of pretrial procedures were available.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 7}}

=====Amnesty=====

During 2011, President [[Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz]] pardoned 269 prisoners, including eight women sentenced for "zina", or sexual relations outside marriage. Human rights activists and individuals associated with drug trafficking were also among those released.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 7}}

===Denial of fair public trial===

The constitution and statutes of Mauritania provide for an independent judiciary, but it was not independent in practice in 2011. The executive branch continued to exercise significant influence over the judiciary through its ability to appoint and remove judges. The government generally respected court orders.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 7}}

Poorly educated and trained judges were susceptible in 2011 to social, financial, and tribal pressures that limited judicial fairness. On 15 May, three juveniles received the death penalty, in violation of national legislation and ratified international conventions, for their role in the death of another minor. Observers suggested that the court was influenced by tribal and social factors. On 12 December, the sentences were reduced to 12 years in prison and a combined 1.2 million ouguiya (US$4,130) fine.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 7}}

During 2011, international donors, including the [[International Organization for Migration]] and the [[World Bank]], funded training for prosecutors and judges with the aim of increasing judicial professionalism.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 8}}

====Trial procedures====

Shari'a provides the legal principles upon which the law and legal procedure are based.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 8}}

The law provides for due process. Defendants are presumed innocent. They have the right to a public trial and to be present during their trial. Juries are not used. All defendants, regardless of the court or their ability to pay, have the legal right to representation by counsel during proceedings. Although a court should appoint an attorney free of charge to represent a defendant lacking the ability to pay, this measure was rarely followed during 2011. Defendants have the right of appeal. Defendants can confront or question witnesses and present witnesses and evidence in both civil and criminal cases. By law, defendants have access to government-held evidence, but access in 2011 was difficult in practice. These rights were extended to minorities. The foregoing rights generally were observed in practice for men but did not extend equally to women.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 8}}

The courts in 2011 did not treat women equally in all cases. Lawyers also reported that in some instances, the unequal treatment of women was based on such considerations as a woman's caste or nationality.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 8}}

A special court hears cases involving persons under the age of 18. Children who appeared before the court received more lenient sentences than adults, and extenuating circumstances received greater consideration in juvenile cases. The minimum age for children to be tried is 12 years old. Children between the ages of 12 and 18 who are convicted of a crime are sentenced to detention centers for minors.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 8}}

====Political prisoners and detainees====

There were no reports in 2011 of [[political prisoner]]s or detainees.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 8}}

====Civil judicial procedures and remedies====

Complaints of human rights violations are within the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court. Individuals or organizations can appeal decisions to international regional courts. Nongovernmental organization representatives stated they collaborated with the court in 2011, but the court was not impartial in practice. There are administrative and judiciary remedies through the social chamber of the Court of Appeals and through the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|pages: 8–9}}

===Arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence===

The constitution of Mauritania prohibits such actions, and the government generally respected these prohibitions in practice in 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 9}}

==Respect for civil liberties==

===Freedom of speech and press===

====Status of freedom of speech and press====

The constitution of Mauritania provides for freedom of speech, and the government in 2011 generally respected this right in practice. Individuals could criticize the government publicly or privately. Two daily newspapers and all broadcast media were government-owned, but several independent daily publications were active and generally expressed a wide variety of views with limited restrictions.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 9}}  Newspapers are relatively free of government pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/dmag/dv/dmag20120125_02_/dmag20120125_02_en.pdf "Countries at the Crossroads 2011: Mauritania", authored by Cedric Jourde, associate professor, School of Political Studies, University of Ottawa, published by ''Freedom House'', page 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some journalists practiced self-censorship when covering topics deemed sensitive, including the military forces, corruption, and the application of Shari'a. There were reports that police detained and questioned journalists during 2011 in connection with their coverage of such topics as protests and slavery. Some opposition leaders asserted that they had no effective access to official media.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 9}}

Independent media remained the principal source of information for most citizens in 2011, followed by government media. Government media focused primarily on official news but provided some coverage of opposition activities and views throughout the year. The government-owned TV Mauritania occasionally broadcast programs covering opposition activities. During the national political dialogue in September and October, government media maintained balanced coverage of opposition and pro-government statements.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|pages: 9–10}}

====Actions to expand press freedom====

On 5 October 2011, the legislative branch adopted amendments to the 2006 Press Freedom Law that abolished prison sentences for slander and defamation of individuals, including heads of state and accredited ambassadors. Fines for these offenses remain in effect. Some journalists continued to object to the "elastic" application of the law, which they assert could be interpreted loosely to penalize journalists for their reporting.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 10}}

Signaling the end of the government's 51-year monopoly of the broadcast media, on 18 September 2011, the High Press and Audiovisual Authority (HAPA) began taking applications for five new radio stations and five new television channels to be owned by nongovernmental entities. HAPA received 17 applications for radio stations and nine applications for television channels. On 20 November, HAPA announced that two independent television stations and five independent radio stations received permission to broadcast. Some members of the opposition asserted that the permits issued favored progovernment interests.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 10}}

====Internet freedom====
The [[OpenNet Initiative]] (ONI) classified Mauritania as engaged in selective Internet filtering in the political area and found no evidence of filtering in the social, security/conflict, and Internet tools areas in 2009.&lt;ref name=ONISS-Nov2011&gt;OpenNet Initiative [http://opennet.net/research/data "Summarized global Internet filtering data spreadsheet"], 29 October 2012, the OpenNet Initiative is a collaborative partnership of the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto; the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University; and the SecDev Group, Ottawa&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ONIChildPornLegal&gt;Due to legal concerns the [[OpenNet Initiative]] does not check for filtering of [[child pornography]] and because their classifications focus on technical filtering, they do not include other types of censorship.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no individual ONI country profile for Mauritania, but it is included in the ONI regional overview for the Middle East and North Africa.&lt;ref name=ONIRO-MENA&gt;[http://opennet.net/research/regions/mena "ONI Regional Overview: Middle East and North Africa"], OpenNet Initiative, August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no government restrictions on access to the [[Internet]] or reports that the government monitored [[email]] or Internet [[chat room]]s in 2010. Individuals and groups could engage in the peaceful expression of views via the Internet, including by e-mail. There is a law prohibiting child pornography with penalties of two months to one year imprisonment and a 160,000 to 300,000 ouguiya ($550 to $1,034) fine.&lt;ref name=USSD-HRR-Mauritania&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154358.htm Country Report on Human Rights Practices: Mauritania 2010], Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 8 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet access is available in urban areas throughout the country, with home access common among the affluent and [[internet café]]s serving the remainder of the population. According to International Telecommunication Union statistics for 2009, approximately 2.28 percent of the country's inhabitants used the Internet.&lt;ref name=USSD-HRR-Mauritania/&gt;

Between 16 March and 19 March 2009 and again on 25 June 2009 the news Web site Taqadoumy was blocked.&lt;ref name=ONIRO-MENA/&gt;&lt;ref name=USSD-HRR-Mauritania-2009&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/af/135965.htm Country Report on Human Rights Practices: Mauritania 2009], Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 11 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 February 2010, Hanevy Ould Dehah, director of Taqadoumy, received a presidential pardon after being detained since December 2009 despite having served his sentence for crimes against Islam and paying all imposed fines and legal fees. Dehah, who was originally arrested in June 2009 on charges of defamation of presidential candidate Ibrahima Sarr for publishing an article stating that Sarr bought a house with campaign money from General Aziz. Dehah, was sentenced in August 2009 to six months in prison and fined 30,000 ouguiya ($111) for committing acts contrary to Islam and decency. The sentencing judge accused Dehah of creating a space allowing individuals to express anti-Islamic and indecent views, based on a female reader's comments made on the Taqadoumy site calling for increased sexual freedom.&lt;ref name=USSD-HRR-Mauritania/&gt;

====Academic freedom and cultural events====

There were no government restrictions in 2011 on academic freedom or cultural events.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 10}}

===Freedom of peaceful assembly and association===

====Freedom of assembly====

The constitution of Mauritania provides for [[freedom of assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=193704 Concerning freedom of assembly, Article 10 of the Mauritanian constitution provides: "L'Etat garantit à tous les citoyens les libertés publiques et individuelles, notamment: ... la liberté de réunion" subject to "la liberté ne peut être limitée que par la loi"]&lt;/ref&gt; The law requires that organizers apply to the local prefect (hakim) for permission to hold large meetings or assemblies. Authorities generally granted permission in 2011 but on some occasions denied it in circumstances that suggested the application of political criteria.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|pages: 10–11}}

Security forces on several occasions in 2011 forcefully dispersed unauthorized demonstrations organized by the Youth of February 25,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnw.nl/africa/bulletin/police-break-mauritanian-youth-rally-against-government "Police break up Mauritanian youth rally against government", ''Radio Netherlands Worldwide: Africa'', 25 April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; a group seeking political, social, and economic reforms, and the Do Not Touch My Nationality movement, which was protesting the registration drive. On 4 August, according to [[Amnesty International]], authorities arrested four antislavery activists for participating in a protest against the alleged enslavement of a 10-year-old girl. The four men were charged with "unauthorized gathering" and "rebellion" and were given six-month suspended sentences by a [[Nouakchott]] court. Another participant whom police detained alleged that police kicked and punched him.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 11}}

====Freedom of association====

The constitution of Mauritania provides for freedom of association,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=193704 Concerning freedom of association, Article 10 of the Mauritanian constitution provides, "L'Etat garantit à tous les citoyens les libertés publiques et individuelles, notamment: ... la liberté d'association et la liberté d'adhérer à toute organisation politique ou syndicale de leur choix" subject to "la liberté ne peut être limitée que par la loi"]&lt;/ref&gt; and the government generally respected this right in 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 11}}

All political parties and local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) must register with the Ministry of the Interior. The government encouraged local NGOs to join the government-sponsored Civil Society Platform during 2011. The approximately 300 NGOs that are members of the platform do not receive government funding.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 11}}

There were approximately 78 accredited political parties and NGOs in 2011, and they generally functioned openly, issuing public statements, and choosing their own leadership. The government generally did not prevent unrecognized political parties or NGOs from functioning.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 11}}

===Freedom of religion===

The constitution, statutes, and policies of Mauritania restrict religious freedom. The 1991 constitution defines the country as an Islamic republic and recognizes Islam as the sole religion of its citizens and the state.&lt;ref name="2011 Religious Report"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/192947.pdf ''International Religious Freedom Report for 2011: Mauritania'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page: 1}}

Because of this stance, all non-Muslims are prohibited from being citizens of the country. Persons who convert from Islam lose their citizenship. Article 306 of the Penal Code outlaws [[apostasy]]. It states that any Muslim found guilty of the crime will be given the opportunity to repent within three days and if the person does not repent, the individual will be sentenced to death and the person's property will be confiscated by the Treasury.&lt;ref name="2011 Religious Report"/&gt;{{rp|pages: 1–2}}

The government and citizenry consider Islam to be the essential cohesive element unifying the various ethnic groups in the country. There is a cabinet-level Ministry of Islamic Affairs and Traditional Education tasked with enacting and communicating [[fatwas]], fighting religious extremism, promoting research in Islamic studies, organizing the pilgrimage and the [[Umrah]], and monitoring mosques. The High Council of Islam, consisting of six imams, advises the government on conformance of legislation to Islamic precepts.&lt;ref name="2011 Religious Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 2}}

There were no reports of abuses of religious freedom in 2011. In an effort to curtail radical extremism, the government collaborated with independent religious organizations on various round tables focused on moderation in Islam.&lt;ref name="2011 Religious Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 3}}

There were no reports in 2011 of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious affiliation, belief, or practice; however, international organizations active among Christians reported that persons who participated in Christian gatherings were ostracized by their families and neighbors.&lt;ref name="2011 Religious Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 4}}

The government prohibits the printing and distribution of non-Islamic religious materials, although possession of these materials is legal. Although there is no specific legal prohibition against proselytizing by non-Muslims, in practice the government prohibits such activity through the broad interpretation of Article 5 of the constitution that states, "Islam shall be the religion of the people and of the State." There is an unofficial government requirement that restricts non-Muslims to holding worship services only in the few Christian churches in the country. The government requires that religious groups receive official authorization before they can meet, even in private homes. In practice, officials did not always enforce this requirement in 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 Religious Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 2}}

The government does not register religious groups; however, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), including humanitarian and development NGOs affiliated with religious groups, must register with the Ministry of the Interior. NGOs must agree to refrain from proselytizing or otherwise promoting any religion other than Islam.&lt;ref name="2011 Religious Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 2}}

[[Mohamed Cheikh Ould Mkhaitir]], a blogger, was arrested in 2014 for apostasy and subsequently sentenced to death.  He remains on death row, as the Supreme Court upheld his sentence and sent the case back to a lower court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://advox.globalvoices.org/2017/01/29/originally-sentenced-to-death-a-blogger-goes-before-mauritanias-supreme-court/|title=Originally Sentenced to Death, a Blogger Goes Before Mauritania’s Supreme Court|date=2017-01-29|website=Global Voices Advocacy|access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of movement, internally displaced persons, protection of refugees, and stateless persons===

The constitution and statutes of Mauritania provide for [[freedom of movement]] within the country, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation. The government generally respected these rights in 2011, but there were exceptions.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 12}}

The government cooperated with the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR), the [[International Organization for Migration]], and other humanitarian organizations in providing protection and assistance to internally displaced persons, refugees, returning refugees, asylum seekers, stateless persons, and other persons of concern. In practice, resources provided by the government were inadequate.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 12}}

Persons lacking identity cards in 2011 could not travel freely in some regions. In response to what it described as an increased terrorist threat, the government set up mobile roadblocks where gendarmerie, police, or customs officials checked the papers of travelers. These roadblocks often provided the occasion for officials to demand bribes.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 12}}

Unlike in 2010, authorities did not restrict international travel of some opposition members in 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 12}}

====Protection of refugees====

The laws of Mauritania provide for the granting of [[right of asylum|asylum]] or refugee status, and the government has established a system for providing protection to refugees. The National Consultative Commission for Refugees (CNCR) is the national body for determining refugee status. The [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] carries out refugee status determinations under its mandate and presents cases to the CNCR for recognition.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 12}}

In 2011, the government provided protection against the expulsion or return of refugees to countries where their lives or freedoms would be threatened on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The government protected approximately 500 refugees during the year.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 13}}

Under agreements with the [[Economic Community of West African States]] on freedom of movement, the government in 2011 allowed West African migrants to remain in the country, deporting only those found illegally seeking to reach the [[Canary Islands]]. According to Interior Ministry statistics, 2,001 migrants were returned to their country of origin during the year.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 13}}

Mauritanian law provides refugees with access to the job market and basic services, including health care and education. The UNHCR provided assistance to refugees with revenue-generating activities throughout 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 13}}

Under an official multiyear repatriation agreement with [[Senegal]], thousands of refugees from that country have returned to Mauritania. The National Agency for the Welcome and Reintegration of Refugees (ANAIR) is responsible for overseeing the reintegration of repatriated refugees, providing administration and identification support, and contributing to the social and economic development of resettlement areas. Reintegration of returnees into communities has been challenging due to inefficient sanitation, health, and education infrastructure, and land disputes. Initially, the majority of Afro-Mauritanian returnees were unable to obtain identity cards and birth certificates, but according to ANAIR, all returnees are included, or scheduled to be included, in the new national registration database that was launched on 6 May 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|pages: 13–14}}

==Respect for political rights: the right of citizens to change their government==

The constitution of Mauritania provides citizens the right to change their government peacefully, and the country accomplished a peaceful transition from military rule with the presidential election of 2009, followed the same year by the indirect election of one-third of the seats in the Senate. However, the government indefinitely postponed scheduled elections of municipal councilors, the members of the National Assembly, and another third of Senate seats, due to inability to reach agreement with opposition parties.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 14}}

===Elections and political participation===

Mauritania returned to constitutional rule in 2009 following the [[Dakar Accord]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndi.org/files/Mauritania-Elections-Bulletin-2011-No2.pdf "Mauritania Elections Bulletin, Issue No. 2: July 16 to July 31, 2011", National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the agreement of President [[Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi]] to resign and the formation of a Transitional Government of National Unity.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 14}}

In an election held in 2009, former High State Council leader General [[Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz]] won 53 percent of the vote. Although some opposition groups claimed the election was fraudulent and requested an investigation, the Constitutional Council certified the election.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 14}}

Elections by municipal councils to fill one-third of the seats in the Senate, also in 2009, resulted in a large win for the Union for the Republic. Opposition and independent candidates denounced what they characterized as heavy pressure on the municipal councilors to vote for majority party candidates and on independent candidates to withdraw. Authorities did not investigate these complaints.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 14}}

Indirect elections for another one third of the Senate seats were originally scheduled for 24 April 2011, but they were postponed twice due to the inability of the government and a coalition of opposition parties to agree on the opposition's demand that the Electoral Code be rewritten, the ruling coalition dissolved, and laws regulating the media reformed. The opposition coalition indicated it would not participate in elections until its demands were met. The majority and opposition parties engaged in a national dialogue from 17 September to 19 October to resolve their political impasse, but no timetable for Senate, National Assembly, or municipal elections had been established by the end of 2011. The Constitutional Council subsequently ruled that a delay of parliamentary elections through May 2012 would be legal.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 15}}

There were 18 women in the National Assembly and six in the 56-seat Senate in 2011. The 27-member cabinet included three women, three Black Moors, and five Afro-Mauritanians. The law requires that women make up at least 20 percent of candidates on legislative candidate lists. It was observed in practice during 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 15}}

==Official corruption and government transparency==

The law provides criminal penalties for official corruption, but authorities in 2011 did not enforce the law effectively, and officials often engaged in corrupt practices with impunity. Corrupt practices were widely believed to exist at all levels of government, and the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators reflected that corruption was a severe problem.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 15}} Mauritania ranked 143 out of 183 countries in the 2011 [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] reported by [[Transparency International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2011/results "Corruption Perceptions Index 2011", Transparency International]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were reports in 2011 that government officials frequently used their power to obtain such favors as unauthorized exemption from taxes, special grants of land, and preferential treatment during bidding on government projects. Corruption was most pervasive in government procurement, bank loans, fishing-license distribution, land distribution, and tax payments.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 15}}

The Ministry of the Interior's Economic Crimes Brigade and the Office of the Inspector General were responsible in 2011 for investigating corruption. On 16 January, the Judiciary Council created the Criminal Division for Economic and Financial Crimes, a special chamber responsible for economic crimes, to reinforce the legal efforts against corruption. During the year, this body completed seven investigations resulting in the dismissal of several government officials.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 15}}

Corruption and impunity were also serious problems in the police force in 2011, and the government rarely held security officials accountable or prosecuted them for abuses. Police regularly demanded bribes at nightly roadblocks in [[Nouakchott]] and at checkpoints between cities. There were numerous reports that police arbitrarily detained individuals for several hours or overnight at roadblocks in Nouakchott or other towns. According to these reports, police detained motorists or passengers without asking for identity papers or vehicle registration, and without searching the vehicles. Judicial corruption was also a problem.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 16}}

In 2011, the government enforced the requirement that senior officials, including the President, file a declaration of their personal assets at the beginning and end of their service. Senior officials reportedly disclose their assets through an internal procedure, but the information is not released to the public.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 16}}

The law provides for public access to government information, and the government granted such access to citizens and noncitizens, including foreign media, during 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 16}}

==Governmental attitude regarding international and nongovernmental investigation of alleged violations of human rights==

Several domestic and international human rights groups generally operated without government restriction in 2011, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials were somewhat cooperative and responsive to their views.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|pages: 16–17}}

An independent ombudsman organization, the National Commission on Human Rights, includes government and civil society representatives. In 2011, it actively monitored human rights and advocated for government action to correct violations.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 17}}

==Discrimination, societal abuses, and trafficking in persons==

The constitution and statutes of Mauritania  does not provide for the equality for all citizens regardless of race, national origin, sex, or social status and prohibit racial or ethnic propaganda. But the government in 2011 often favored individuals on the basis of racial and tribal affiliation, social status, and political ties.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 17}}

===Women===

According to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), the incidence of both reported and unreported rape in 2011 continued to be high, and rape was considered a serious problem. Rape, including spousal rape, is illegal. According to the Penal Code, rapists who are single men faced penalties of forced labor and flagellation. Married rapists could be subject to the death penalty. In practice, rape cases rarely went to trial. In several cases, wealthy rape suspects reportedly avoided prosecution or, if prosecuted, avoided prison. Families of the victim commonly reached an agreement with the rapist for monetary compensation. National statistics on arrests, prosecutions, and convictions for rape were unavailable. Human rights activists and lawyers reported that rape victims were stigmatized, persecuted, and even imprisoned. Since rape was tied to the concept of adultery, judges could hold the victim responsible for the rape. There were no convictions for rape during 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 17}}

Domestic violence was considered a serious problem in 2011. Spousal abuse and domestic violence are illegal, but the government did not enforce the law effectively, and most cases went unreported. There are no specific penalties for domestic violence, and convictions were very rare. No reliable government statistics on prosecutions, convictions, and sentences for domestic violence were available. In 2010, the Association of Female Heads of Families (AFCF) provided legal assistance to 1,753 domestic violence victims. Police and the judiciary occasionally intervened in domestic abuse cases, but women rarely sought legal redress, relying instead on family, NGOs, and community leaders to resolve domestic disputes. Many domestic violence cases are handled by a traditional judge under Shari'a outside the secular system. NGOs reported that in certain cases they had turned directly to police for help to protect victims of domestic violence, but police declined to investigate.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|pages: 17–18}}

Traditional forms of mistreatment of women appeared to decline during 2011. One of these is the forced feeding of adolescent girls (gavage) prior to marriage practiced only among White Moor tribal groups. Increased government, media, and civil society attention to the problem, including the health risks associated with excessive body weight, led to a marked decline in the traditional encouragement of female obesity. Overeating to conform to cultural standards was practiced primarily in rural areas, but many urban women endangered their health by taking pills to gain weight or increase their appetite.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 18}}

There are no laws against sexual harassment. Women's NGOs reported in 2011 that it was a common problem in the workplace.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 18}}

The government in 2011 recognized the right of individuals and couples to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing, and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so free from discrimination, violence, or coercion. Reproductive issues were a sensitive topic and a focus of some women's groups. Government health centers did not provide unmarried women with access to contraception, and did so for married women only with the consent of the husband. Contraception was available at private health centers for those who could afford it.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 18}}

Women have legal rights to property and child custody, and these rights were recognized in 2011 among the more educated and urbanized members of the population. However, women's legal rights were restricted in comparison with those of men. Divorced women could potentially lose child custody if they remarried. By local tradition, a woman's first marriage requires parental consent. In accordance with the personal status code, men can marry up to four women but are required to obtain the consent of their existing spouse or spouses before marrying again. Government awareness programs encouraged women to obtain a contractual agreement at the time of marriage stipulating that the marriage ends if the husband marries a second wife. This practice was common in Moor society. Nevertheless, women who did not establish a solid contract remained unprotected. In addition, the validity of and right to establish prenuptial agreements were not always respected. Polygamy continued to be rare among Moors but was gaining in popularity. It was common among other ethnic groups. Arranged marriages were increasingly rare, particularly among the Moor population. Cultural resistance to marriages among members of different castes persisted, and NGOs reported that powerful individuals used the judicial system to intimidate and persecute members of their families who married below their social rank.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 19}}

Women still faced legal discrimination in 2011, and they were considered minors in the eyes of the law. According to Shari'a as applied in Mauritania, the testimony of two women was necessary to equal that of one man. The courts granted only half as large an indemnity to the family of a woman who was killed as to the family of a man. Formulas for property distribution varied widely from case to case. Human rights lawyers reported that judges treated differently cases concerning White Moor women, female slaves or other lower-caste women, and foreign women. The personal status code provides a framework for the consistent application of secular law and Shari'a-based family law, but it is not uniformly employed.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 19}}

Women did not face legal discrimination in 2011 in areas not addressed specifically by Shari'a. The law provides that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work. The two largest employers, the civil service and the state mining company, observed this law, although most employers in the private sector did not apply it in practice. In the modern wage sector, women also received family benefits, including three months of maternity leave.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 20}}

===Children===

The law makes special provision for children's welfare, and there were government programs in 2011 to care for [[child abandonment|abandoned children]]. But inadequate funding hampered the effectiveness of these programs.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 20}}

====Birth registration====

By law, citizenship is normally derived from one's father. Citizenship can be derived from one's mother under the following two conditions: (1) if the mother is a citizen and the father's nationality is unknown; or (2) if the child was born in Mauritania to a citizen mother and repudiates the father's nationality a year before reaching majority. Children born abroad to citizens can acquire citizenship one year before reaching majority. Minor children of parents who have become naturalized citizens are also eligible for citizenship.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 20}}

In most of the country in 2011, the government generally registered births immediately, but in the south, many citizens reported not having birth certificates or national identity papers. In addition, some slaves did not have birth certificates. There was no official data about the number of unregistered births.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 20}}

====Education====

The law mandates six years of school attendance for all children, but the law was not effectively enforced in 2011. Many children, particularly girls, did not attend school for six years. Children of slave-caste families often did not receive an education.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 20}}

Public education was tuition-free through [[university]] level. Classes were fully integrated in 2011, including both boys and girls and students from all social and ethnic groups.
In addition to public schools, almost all children, regardless of gender or ethnic group, attended [[Koranic school|Qur'anic school]] between the ages of five and seven and gained at least rudimentary skills in reading and writing [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 21}}

====Child abuse====

Child abuse was reported, but no data was available to indicate its prevalence in 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 21}}

====Child labor====

As reported in the latest version of the [[U.S. Department of Labor]]'s ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'', instances of [[child labor]] are still observed in agriculture and cattle herding.

====Child marriage====

The legal marriage age is 18, but the law was rarely enforced, and reports of child marriage were widespread. Because consensual sex outside of marriage is illegal, a "weli" (tutor) can present a case to local authorities requesting permission for a girl younger than 18 years old to marry. In practice, authorities frequently granted this permission.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 21}}

====Harmful traditional practices====

[[Female genital mutilation]] (FGM) was practiced in 2011 by all ethnic groups and performed on young girls, often on the seventh day after birth and almost always before the age of six months. The child protection Penal Code states that any act or attempt to damage a female child's sexual organs is punishable by imprisonment and a 120,000 to 300,000 ouguiya (US$410 to $1,034) penalty. The most recent statistics on FGM indicated a decrease in incidence from 71 percent in 2001 to 65 percent in 2007, mainly due to a decline in the practice among urban dwellers. [[Infibulation]], the most severe form of excision, was not practiced.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 21}}

The government and international nongovernmental organizations continued in 2011 to coordinate their anti-FGM efforts, which were focused on eradicating the practice in hospitals, discouraging [[midwives]] from practicing FGM, and educating the population. The government, the [[United Nations Population Fund]], the [[United Nations Children's Fund]], and the national Imams' Association joined other civil society members to emphasize the serious health risks of FGM and correct the widespread belief that the practice was a religious requirement. Government hospitals and licensed medical practitioners were barred from performing FGM, and several government agencies worked to prevent others from perpetrating it. According to several women's rights experts, these efforts appeared to be changing popular attitudes.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 21}}

====Sexual exploitation of children====

Mauritanian law prohibits adult sexual relations with a child, with penalties of six months to two years in prison and a 120,000 to 180,000 ouguiya (US$410 to $620) fine. The possession of child pornography is also illegal, with penalties of two months to one year in prison and a 160,000 to 300,000 ouguiya (US$550 to $1,034) fine. Commercial sexual exploitation of children is illegal and conviction carries penalties of two to five years in prison and a fine of 200,000 to 2 million ouguiya (US$690 to $6,900). In some instances, men from the Middle East contracted "temporary marriages" as a means to traffic and exploit young Mauritanian girls and women in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 22}}

====Displaced children====

Although the Ministry of Social Affairs, Children, and the Family monitored 900 of the estimated 1,200 street children in [[Nouakchott]] through its youth insertion centers in Dar Naim and El Mina, government assistance to street children in 2011 was limited. During the year, the local nongovernmental organization Infancy and Development in Mauritania monitored 760 children in Nouakchott and [[Nouadhibou]] who lived on the streets largely as the result of poverty and the urbanization of formerly nomadic families.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 22}}

====International child abductions====

Mauritania is not a party to the 1980 [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]].&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 22}}

===Anti-semitism===

A very small number of expatriates practiced [[Judaism]]. There were no reports in 2011 of anti-Semitic acts.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 22}}

===Trafficking in persons===
{{Main|Human trafficking in Mauritania}}

Mauritania is a source, transit, and destination country for women, men, and children subjected to conditions of forced labor and sex trafficking. Adults and children from traditional slave castes are subjected to slavery-related practices rooted in ancestral master-slave relationships. Reliable data on the total number of slaves do not exist, but according to the estimate of a respected Mauritanian nongovernmental organization (NGO), slavery may affect up to 20 percent of the population in both rural and urban settings. Held for generations by slave-holding families, persons subjected to slavery are forced to work without pay as cattle herders and domestic servants.&lt;ref name="2011 Trafficking"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/192596.pdf ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2012: Mauritania'', Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, U.S. Department of State]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page: 243}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/mauritania.htm Mauritania, 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some boys from within Mauritania and other West African countries who study at Koranic schools – referred to as "talibes" – are subsequently subjected to forced begging by corrupt religious teachers known as "marabouts".&lt;ref name="2011 Trafficking"/&gt;{{rp|pages: 243–4}}

Mauritanian girls as well as girls from Mali, Senegal, The Gambia, and other West African countries are forced into domestic servitude. Mauritanian women and girls are forced into prostitution in the country or transported to countries in the Middle East for the same purpose. Men from Middle Eastern countries use legally contracted "temporary marriages" as a means to sexually exploit young girls and women in Mauritania.&lt;ref name="2011 Trafficking"/&gt;{{rp|page: 244}}

The government does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, but it is making efforts to do so. The government acknowledges that some forms of trafficking are a problem in the country. For the first time in its history, in November 2011, the government successfully prosecuted and punished a slave-master under its 2007 anti-slavery law. In early 2011, the Parliament approved a constitutional provision criminalizing slavery and all forms of exploitation, equating them to crimes against humanity. In August, the government also enacted a new statute to strengthen the Labor Code governing the employment of domestic workers in private households. Despite these efforts, investigations and prosecutions in 2011 remained minimal and protective services for victims were inadequate.&lt;ref name="2011 Trafficking"/&gt;{{rp|page: 244}}

All forms of trafficking, except hereditary slavery, are prohibited by Mauritania's 2003 Law Against Trafficking in Persons, which prescribes penalties of five to 10 years' imprisonment for violations. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and exceed those prescribed for rape.&lt;ref name="2011 Trafficking"/&gt;{{rp|page: 244}}

Slavery, including hereditary slavery, is prohibited by Law 2007-048, which was enacted in September 2007. The law defines slavery and prescribes a sufficiently stringent penalty of five to 10 years' imprisonment for violations. The law's effectiveness remains impaired by its requirement that slaves file a legal complaint before prosecution can be pursued as well as by its barring of NGOs from filing complaints on behalf of slaves. Many slaves are illiterate and unable to complete the paperwork involved in filing a criminal or civil complaint. The government in 2011 provided no support for programs to assist victims in filing complaints on slavery.&lt;ref name="2011 Trafficking"/&gt;{{rp|page: 244}}

===Persons with disabilities===

Mauritanian law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical disabilities in education, employment, or the provision of other state services. There were no reports in 2011 of governmental discrimination against persons with disabilities. However, persons with disabilities generally did not have access to buildings, information, and communications, and there were no government programs to provide such access. The government did not mandate preference in employment, education, or public accessibility for persons with disabilities, although it did provide some rehabilitation and other assistance for such persons.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 23}}

===National, racial, and ethnic minorities===

Ethnic [[minority groups|minorities]] faced governmental discrimination in 2011. The inconsistent issuance of national identification cards, which were required for voting, effectively disenfranchised many members of southern minority groups. Racial and cultural tension and discrimination also arose from the geographic and cultural divides between [[Moors]] and Afro-Mauritanians. The Moors are divided among numerous ethnolinguistic tribal and clan groups and further distinguished as either White Moor or Black Moor, although it was often difficult to distinguish between the two by skin color. White Moor tribes and clans, many of whom are dark-skinned after centuries of intermarriage with [[Berbers]] and sub-Saharan African groups, dominated positions in government and business. The Black Moors (also called [[haratines]] or freed slaves) remained politically and economically weaker than White Moors. Afro-Mauritanian ethnic groups, which include the [[Halpulaar]] (the largest non-Moor group), [[Wolof people|Wolof]], and [[Soninke people|Soninke]], are concentrated in the South and urban areas. Afro-Mauritanians were underrepresented in the government and military.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 23}}

The Mauritanian constitution designates [[Arabic]] as the official language and Arabic, Pulaar, [[Soninke language|Soninke]], and [[Wolof language|Wolof]] as the country's national languages. The government continued to encourage French and Arabic bilingualism within the school system, as opposed to earlier efforts at "arabization". Neither the Afro-Mauritanian national languages nor the local Hassaniya Arabic dialect were used as languages of instruction.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 23}}

Ethnic rivalry in 2011 contributed to political divisions and tensions. Some political parties tended to have readily identifiable ethnic bases, although political coalitions continued to be underrepresented in mid- to high-level public and private sector jobs.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|pages: 23–4}}

There were numerous reports in 2011 of land disputes between former slaves, Afro-Mauritanians, and Moors. According to human rights activists and press reports, local authorities allowed Moors to expropriate land occupied by former slaves and Afro-Mauritanians or to obstruct access to water and pastures.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 24}}

In 2011, human rights nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) reported numerous cases of inheritance disputes between slaves or former slaves and their masters. Traditionally, slave masters inherited their slaves' possessions.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 24}}

The Mauritanian government's Program to Eradicate the Effects of Slavery, begun in 2009, continued during 2011. Its goals were to reduce poverty among the 44,750 former slaves in the [[Assaba]], [[Brakna]], [[Gorgol Region|Gorgol]], and [[Hodh Ech Chargui]] regions and improve their access to water, health, education, and income-generating opportunities. However, the program's activities were reduced during 2011 after former human rights commissioner [[Ould Daddeh]] was arrested along with senior-level staff, including its coordinator and its financial director, on findings of corruption in a government inspection. NGOs maintained that the commissioner was arrested for political reasons.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 24}}

The government also continued in 2011 its collaborative program with the United Nations on conflict prevention aimed at promoting democratic values and the rights of marginalized populations, including former slaves. According to the NGO SOS Esclaves, these programs focused on fighting poverty and the effects of slavery rather than the practice of slavery itself.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 24}}

===Societal abuses, discrimination, and acts of violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity===

Under [[Shari'a]], as applied in Mauritania, consensual same-sex sexual activity between men is punishable by death if witnessed by four individuals, and such activity between women is punishable by three months to two years in prison and a 5,000 to 60,000 ouguiya (US$17 to $207) fine. There were no criminal prosecutions during the year. There was no evidence of societal violence, societal discrimination, or systematic government discrimination based on sexual orientation. There were no organizations advocating for sexual orientation or gender-identity rights, but there were no legal impediments to the operation of such groups.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|pages: 24–5}}

===Other societal violence or discrimination===

There was no evidence of governmental discrimination against persons with [[HIV/AIDS]], but societal taboos and beliefs associated with the disease in some areas caused infected persons to face isolation or exclusion.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 25}}

==Worker rights==

===Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining===

Mauritanian law allows workers to form and join independent unions of their choice and provides the right to conduct legal strikes and to bargain collectively, although long and complex procedures must be followed before a legal strike can be called. Workers and unions organized several strikes during 2011. International labor observers reported that authorities also repressed a number of strikes. The government can dissolve a union for what it considers an illegal or politically motivated strike, but it did not dissolve any unions during the year. Workers must provide advance notice of at least 10 working days for any strike. Workers are not allowed to hold sit-ins or to block nonstriking workers from entering work premises.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|pages: 25–6}}

To be legally recognized, a union must have the authorization of the public prosecutor, who can provisionally suspend a trade union at the request of the Ministry of the Interior if the ministry believes that the union has not complied with the law.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 25}}

Laws prohibit antiunion discrimination. Under the law, all workers except members of the armed forces and police were free in 2011 to associate in and establish unions at the local and national levels. In 2011, nearly 90 percent of industrial and commercial workers were unionized. However, only 25 percent of workers were employed in regularly paid positions. A majority worked in the informal sector, primarily subsistence agriculture and animal husbandry.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 25}}

Unions exercised their right to organize workers during 2011. However, the head of government decides how negotiations are to be conducted once the Ministry for the Civil Service agrees on negotiations.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 26}}

While antiunion discrimination is illegal, national human rights groups and unions reported that authorities did not actively investigate alleged antiunion practices in some private firms owned by very wealthy citizens.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 26}}

===Prohibition of forced or compulsory labor===

The law prohibits forced or [[unfree labour|compulsory labor]], including by children. The law criminalizes the practice of slavery and imposes penalties on government officials who do not take action on reported cases. The law includes criminal penalties also for contracting to benefit from forced labor and for exploiting forced labor as part of an organized criminal network. Although significant advances were made during 2011, government efforts to enforce the antislavery law were widely acknowledged to be inadequate when compared with the dimensions of the problem.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 26}}

There were reports in 2011 of forced child labor.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 26}}

Slavery-like practices, typically flowing from ancestral master-slave relationships and involving both adults and children, continued in 2011. Former slaves and their descendants were impelled to remain in a dependent status in part of the lack of marketable skills, poverty, and persistent drought. Such practices occurred primarily in areas where educational levels were generally low or a barter economy still prevailed, and in urban centers, including [[Nouakchott]], where slavery-like domestic service existed. The practices commonly occurred where there was a need for workers to herd livestock, tend fields, and do other manual labor. Some former slaves and descendants of slaves were pushed into working for their old masters in exchange for some combination of money, lodging, food, and medical care. Individuals in these subservient circumstances were vulnerable to mistreatment. Women with children faced particular difficulties and could be compelled to remain in a condition of servitude, performing domestic duties, tending fields, or herding animals without remuneration.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 26}}

Some former slaves reportedly continued to work in 2011 for their former masters or others without remuneration in order to retain access to land they traditionally farmed. Although the law provides for distribution of land to the landless, including to former slaves, authorities have enforced it in only a few cases. Nongovernmental organization observers suggested that deeply embedded psychological and tribal bonds also made it difficult for many individuals whose forbearers had been slaves for generations, to break their bonds with former masters or their tribes. Some persons continued to link themselves to former masters because they believed their slave status had been divinely ordained and they feared religious punishment if that bond were broken. Former slaves were often subjected to social discrimination and limited to performing manual labor in markets, ports, and airports.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 27}}

Forced labor also occurred in 2011 in urban centers where young children, often girls, were retained as unpaid household servants. Some individuals self-identified as slaves or masters and claimed with varying degrees of plausibility that they were unaware that slavery had been abolished. Human rights groups reported that persons in slave-like relationships were persuaded by their masters to deny the relationship to activists.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 27}}

In 2011, men, women, and children were trafficked for and subjected to domestic service, street begging for unscrupulous religious teachers, and slave-like relationships as domestic servants or herders. The law criminalizes the practice of slavery and imposes penalties on government officials who do not take action on reported cases.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 27}}

On 13 April 2011, the government tried its first case under the antislavery law. The defendants were acquitted the same day. On 20 November, the first conviction for slavery was obtained in the case of two enslaved youths. The master received a sentence of two years' imprisonment, and his family members received suspended sentences. They were also ordered to pay a fine of 1.35 million ouguiya (US$4,655). The mother of the two youths received a one-year suspended sentence.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 27}}

The government also prosecuted an alleged slaveholder using the lesser charge of child exploitation, and on 16 January 2011, a court convicted her and prescribed a jail sentence. In March, however, the Nouakchott Court of Appeals acquitted her.&lt;ref name="2011 Report"/&gt;{{rp|page: 28}}

===Prohibition of child labor and minimum age for employment===

The law provides that children cannot be employed before the age of 14 in the nonagricultural sector or under age 13 in the agricultural sector unless the minister of labor grants an exception due to local circumstances; however, [[child labor]] in the informal sector was a significant problem, particularly within poorer inner-city areas. The law states that employed children between the ages of 14 and 16 should receive 70 percent of the minimum wage and that those between the ages of 17 and 18 should receive 90 percent of the minimum wage.&lt;ref name=ussdhr07&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2007/100493.htm Mauritania. Country Reports on Human Rights Practices  - 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Justice, working with UNICEF, worked to repatriate Mauritanian children who had been sent to work as camel jockeys in the United Arab Emirates. The ministry formally arranged the repatriation of 12 youths under the program and provided family counseling for the repatriated youths plus additional youth who had previously worked as camel jockeys.&lt;ref name=ussdhr07/&gt;

Young rural children were commonly employed in [[herding]], cultivation, [[fishing]], and other labor to support their families. Young children in urban areas often drove [[donkey]] carts and delivered water and building materials. Some marabouts provided their talibes with insufficient food and shelter and forced them to beg for over 12&amp;nbsp;hours a day. In keeping with longstanding tradition, many children served apprenticeships in small industries and in the informal sector. Reporting by some NGOs, including SOS‑Esclaves, strongly stated that domestic employment, often unpaid, of girls as young as seven in wealthier homes was a growing problem. There was no child labor in the modern industrial sector.&lt;ref name=ussdhr07/&gt;

Several government offices have responsibility for enforcing [[child labor law]]s, including the ministries of labor; justice; women's, children's, and family affairs; and the Commission for Food Security and Social Protection. There was a labor inspectorate with the authority to refer violations to judicial authorities, but the eight regional inspectors and 30 inspector/controllers lacked the basic resources, such as transport and office equipment, needed to enforce existing child labor and other labor laws.&lt;ref name=ussdhr07/&gt;

===Acceptable conditions of work===

The nationally mandated minimum monthly wage for adults, which was not enforced, was $77 (21,000 ouguiya), which did not provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.&lt;ref name=ussdhr07/&gt;

The standard, legal, nonagricultural workweek could not exceed either 40&amp;nbsp;hours or six days without [[overtime]] compensation, which was paid at rates that were graduated according to the number of overtime hours worked. Domestic and certain other workers could work 56&amp;nbsp;hours per week. Employees are required to be given at least one 24‑hour period of rest per week. The Labor Directorate of the Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcement of labor laws, but in practice inadequate funding limited the effectiveness of enforcement.&lt;ref name=ussdhr07/&gt;

The government set health and safety standards, and the Ministry of Labor was responsible for enforcing these standards, but did so inconsistently. In principle workers could remove themselves from hazardous conditions without risking loss of employment, but in practice they could not.&lt;ref name=ussdhr07/&gt;

==Notes==
:1.{{note|a}}Note that the "Year" signifies the "Year covered". Therefore the information for the year marked 2008 is from the report published in 2009, and so on.
:2.{{note|b}}As of January 1.
:3.{{note|c}}The 1982 report covers the year 1981 and the first half of 1982, and the following 1984 report covers the second half of 1982 and the whole of 1983. In the interest of simplicity, these two aberrant "year and a half" reports have been split into three year-long reports through interpolation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16983">The British [[Independent Labour Party]] sent a small contingent to fight in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The contingent fought alongside the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification ([[POUM]]) and included [[George Orwell]], who subsequently wrote about his experiences in his personal account ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''.

==Contingent membership==
The main body of the ILP contingent consisting of about 25 men departed from England on 1 January 1937, under the leadership of [[Robert Edwards (politician)|Bob Edwards]], later a [[Member of Parliament]] for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. 

The ILP had begun organising volunteers in November 1936 following the return to Britain of Bob Edwards from delivering an ambulance sent by the ILP for the POUM militia. Though there had been five times the number of volunteers, the ILP would only accept unmarried men for its contingent and 25 men left Britain on 8 January as the vanguard of a larger force to be sent later. However, the day after the contingent left, the British government announced that it would prosecute anyone going to fight in Spain and the ILP did not try to recruit any more volunteers.&lt;ref name="fundanin"&gt;[http://www.fundanin.org/durgan1.htm Durgan, Andy “International Volunteers in the POUM Militias”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108182707/http://www.fundanin.org/durgan1.htm |date=2009-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On arriving in [[Barcelona]], they had two weeks of very basic training, and were joined by Bob Smillie, grandson of the well-known Scottish socialist and [[Robert Smillie|miners' leader of the same name]]. Smillie, who had been in Barcelona working with [[John McNair (UK politician)|John McNair]] as the representative [[International Bureau of Revolutionary Youth Organizations|Youth section]] of the [[International Bureau for Revolutionary Socialist Unity]]. However, Smillie became convinced that he would be of most service at the front and persuaded McNair to let him sign up when the ILP contingent came over.&lt;ref name="fundanin"/&gt; He later died in Valencia.

The ILP contingent was attached to the POUM’s English-speaking contingent, as part of the centuria commanded by [[Georges Kopp]]. Once at the front, the initial group of twenty-five was sent to the front at Monte Oscuro, within sight of [[Zaragoza]], some 12 miles to the south west, where they joined by a number of others who had arrived at the front a few weeks earlier, including Eric Blair, not yet using his pen name [[George Orwell]]; an Australian, Harvey Buttonshaw; US [[Revolutionary Workers League (Oehlerite)|Revolutionary Workers League]] member [[Wolf Kupinski]]; and Bob Williams, a [[Wales|Welshman]] married to a [[Spain|Spanish]] woman who joined up with his brother-in-law, Ramon.  With these, and other, additions the ILP contingent numbered somewhere between thirty and thirty-five. They left the front, with the POUM militia, in mid-February 1937 to take part in the [[siege]] of [[Huesca]], some 50 miles away.

Eric Blair's background, prep school and [[Eton College|Eton]] and his experience in [[Burma]] as police officer, are well known. The backgrounds of the other members of the contingent were diverse. Members were recorded as coming from [[South Africa]] (Buck Parker&lt;ref name="cejl"&gt;''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 1 - An Age Like This 1945-1950'' p.298 (Penguin)&lt;/ref&gt;), the [[United States]] (Harry Milton,&lt;ref name="cejl"/&gt; [[Wales]], [[Belfast]] (Paddy O'Hara), [[Chorley]], [[Larkhall]], [[Glasgow]] (Charles Doran), [[Anglesey]], [[Manchester]], [[Bristol]] (Tom Coles), [[Dartford]], [[Bingley]], [[Twickenham]] and [[Golders Green]]. Four had fought in the [[World War I|First World War]]: Martin, who had gone to Spain driving the ambulance with Edwards and who, because of his experience in artillery, had stayed on; Doran; Harry Thomas of London and Arthur Chambers, who died in 1938 after transferring to a [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] unit. Few others, apart from Harry Webb, the stretcher-bearer and O'Hara, who had some training in first aid, had either military or medical experience.

==War experiences==
Arriving at the Lenin Barracks in [[Barcelona]], where they were initially stationed, on 10 January, a discussion circle was formed. Whilst the discussion group centred on political issues the group was not solely concerned with such topics. A social secretary was also appointed to 'arrange concerts and entertainments' and a sports secretary was elected with a hasty football match organised between the ILPers and a team of Spanish militia-men. 

The training received at the Barracks was notoriously short and at the end of January the ILP contingent, as the British section of the POUM militia, began their journey, stopping off at [[Lerida]], where they were visited by the ILP's representative in Spain, John McNair, before leaving for the area surrounding [[Huesca]] on the Aragon Front on 2 February.  At the front, the contingent took over three advanced posts, about 100 yards distant from the others, joined by [[trench warfare|communication trenches]]. The outposts, on the slope of the hills looking west, were about two hundred yards from the nearest Nationalist lines on the opposite slopes looking east.

Bob Edwards, reporting in the ''[[Labour Leader|New Leader]]'', the ILP's weekly paper, was keen to stress the most 'exciting' aspects of the unit's work. He wrote about scouting within hearing distance along the Nationalist lines with Blair, of holding their position and dealing with the desertion of Nationalists. The main descriptions of fighting against the Nationalists which appears both in ''Homage to Catalonia'' and in the ''New Leader'', concerned a night attack in which some of the contingent took part resulting in injuries to Reg Hiddlestone, Paddy Thomas and Douglas Thompson. Injuries were also sustained at other times, Blair himself was famously shot through the throat by a sniper.&lt;ref name="jnewsinger"/&gt; However, the reality of the contingent's activity was more mundane. It largely consisted of building roads from their dug-out to the nearest Spanish position and creating a dug-out for community purposes where they could meet to talk and receive instructions.  In terms of military combat the contingent saw relatively little action.

As Orwell later put it:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Orwell|chapter=Homage to Catalonia|title=Orwell in Spain|page=64|isbn=978-0-14-118516-3|year=2001|origyear=Originally published 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Meanwhile nothing happened, nothing ever happened. The English had got into the habit of saying that this wasn't a war it was a bloody pantomime.''

==Suppression of POUM==
Although the ILP contingent did not play a major part in the military side of the Spanish Civil War it was famously and controversially involved in the events surrounding the battles between rival [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] groups in Barcelona, known as the [[Barcelona May Days]].
 
The ILP contingent, although on leave in Barcelona, were split into groups during this fighting and none of the ILP contingent were drawn into the fighting in any extended way. However, the significance of the Barcelona for the ILP lay not so much in the events themselves as in the reaction to the situation. Immediately after the events the Communist press began to attack POUM, claiming they were solely responsible for the fighting and were in league with the fascists in doing so. These accusations were quickly published in the ''[[Daily Worker]]'', appearing in the 11 May issue. The ''New Leader'' of 21 May carried extensive comment on the 'Counter-Revolution in Spain'. ILP General Secretary [[Fenner Brockway]] argued that the Communists were on the wrong side of the barricades and were now 'committed to the defence of property', suggesting that the Communist Parties not only in Spain, but everywhere, had ceased to be revolutionary parties. The Communist Party responded by accusing the ILP of 'taking part in the fascist rising'. 

On 16 June, the POUM was made illegal, accused of collaborating with the enemy. Its leaders were arrested and [[Andreu Nin]] murdered. ILP leader John McNair arrived in Barcelona on 18 June with money and documents to organise the evacuation of the ILP contingent and was promptly arrested as a "POUM agent" but was released when he had proven his identity. He then went into hiding with Orwell and Cottman and managed to leave the country. Most of the rest of the contingent returned to Britain over the next six months.&lt;ref name="fundanin"/&gt;
 
Meanwhile, in Britain, the Communist Party press had been accusing both the ILP and POUM of being agents of fascism. The press published two interviews with former contingent member Frank Frankford claiming he had witnessed fraternisation at the front with the enemy, that Kopp was receiving his orders from Huesca and that the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist faction]] even supplied the POUM with arms.&lt;ref name="fundanin"/&gt;

The situation for the members of the ILP contingent in Spain was made extremely uncomfortable by the attacks on POUM and it became more so as the Communists banned the ILP's Spanish 'brother party'. The ILP made considerable efforts to get its members home safely and several of the ILP contingent made furtive returns home escaping police arrest.  For example, Cottmann, McNair, Blair and his wife Eileen O'Shaughnessy, who had been working for McNair at the ILP office, made an escape across the border by train posing as wealthy English businessmen.&lt;ref name="jnewsinger"&gt;[http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj62/newsinger.htm Newsinger, John "Orwell and the Spanish Revolution" ''International Socialism Journal'' Issue 62 Spring 1994] The author states that evidence discovered at the National Historical Archives in Madrid in 1989 of a security police report to the Tribunal for Espionage and High Treason described 'Eric Blair and his wife Eileen Blair, as "known Trotskyists" and as "linking agents of the ILP and the POUM". Newsinger goes on to state that given Orwell's precarious health, "there can be little doubt that if he had been arrested he would have died in prison."&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Of those closely associated with the ILP contingment, the arrest of Kopp, the unit commander, and Milton, one of the [[United States|American]] members of the contingent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3475881.html "Harry Milton - The Man Who Saved Orwell"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224001114/http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3475881.html |date=2009-02-24 }} The Hoover Institution. Retrieved on 2008-12-23&lt;/ref&gt; were of particular concern. However, both were eventually released. Milton did not spend long in jail, as McNair ensured his release. Kopp on the other hand, despite attempted intervention on his behalf by the ILP, remained in prison for a further eighteen months. However, most attention both at the time and since, has focused on the case of Bob Smillie who died in jail in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], officially of appendicitis, on 13 June.&lt;ref name="fundanin"/&gt; Smillie's death has been surrounded in mystery, and has been the subject of much speculation, focussing on accusations that he was "done to death" by the Communists. Although the issue remains controversial, recent scholarship tends to concur with the contemporary findings of the official ILP report into the investigation, conducted by David Murray of Motherwell ILP, found that the authorities were guilty of carelessness rather than violence or direct malice.

Smillie, the first foreigner associated with the POUM to become a mortal victim of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist repression]], had been detained at the French border accused of "carrying arms" - a dud hand-bomb was found among the various souvenirs he had with him.&lt;ref name="fundanin"/&gt; 

By November 1937, there were claimed to be 15,000 anti-fascist prisoners in the Republic’s jails, about 1,000 of them from the POUM. The [[Right Opposition]] and other marxist groupings organised an international campaign in solidarity with the POUM prisoners which probably saved their leaders from a similar fate to Nin’s. The IBRSU also sent several delegations to Spain to visit the party’s prisoners and try to secure their release, the first headed by its General Secretary, [[Fenner Brockway]]. In August, another delegation arrived including the ILP MP [[James Maxton]]. A third delegation went in November headed by another ILP MP, [[John McGovern (politician)|John McGovern]].&lt;ref name="fundanin"/&gt;

Despite the suppression of POUM, not all of the ILP contingent returned home immediately. Arthur Chambers, Bob Williams and Reg Hiddlestone all stayed on to fight in Spain. Williams returned home in December 1938 after being injured three times, Hiddleston was the final member of the contingent left in Spain, returning home in February 1939, leaving Barcelona only hours before Barcelona fell. Chambers was the only member of the ILP contingent to be killed in combat in Spain when he was shot by a sniper in August 1938 after transferring to a [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) unit.&lt;ref name="fundanin"/&gt;

The '''International Alliance of Socialist Democracy''' was an organisation founded by [[Mikhail Bakunin]] along with 79 other members on October 28, 1868 as an organisation within the [[International Workingmen's Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leier|first=Mark|year=2006|pp=251|title=[[Bakunin: The Creative Passion]]|publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]|isbn=978-1-58322-894-4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the ''Alliance'' as a section of the IWA was not accepted by the central committee of the IWA because international organisations were not allowed to join. The ''Alliance'' dissolved shortly afterwards and the former members instead joined their respective national sections of the International Workingmen's Association.

'''Kent Association for the Blind''' is a [[registered charity]] providing rehabilitation services for children and adults with [[visual impairment]] to support them and help them live independent lives. Services are provided by six, specialist rehabilitation teams based in offices in [[Kent]], [[Medway]] and [[Bromley]]. Additional specialist support is provided in [[Bexley]].

==Origins==
[[File:British 55th Division gas casualties 10 April 1918.jpg|250px|left]]
The charity was founded in 1920 to provide registration and support services for soldiers whose vision had been damaged during the [[World War I|First World War]]. The UK Government’s ‘Blind Person’s Act’ of 1920 authorised Local Authorities to “promote the welfare of blind persons”.&lt;ref&gt;KAB First Annual Report, 1921&lt;/ref&gt; The primary responsibilities of the Association were “the compilation of a complete and up-to-date register of all blind persons in the County" and "the investigation of all cases needing help”.&lt;ref&gt;KAB First Annual Report, 1921&lt;/ref&gt; By March 1921, nine months after the Association was created, 902 people had been registered (the population of Kent in June 1921 was 1.6m&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/bicentenary/pdfs/kent.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;), and it had provided services for 70 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;KAB First Annual Report, 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current services&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kab.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;==

===Rehabilitation===

Rehabilitation services provide information and advice, and daily living skills and mobility training to help ensure that people with sight impairments are able to live active and independent lives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medway.gov.uk/index/socialcare/adults/disability/blindness.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Specialist support for people with learning disabilities recognises that there is a much higher incidence of sight impairments amongst people with learning disabilities than the non-learning disabled population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.nhs.uk/Eyes/ViewResource.aspx?resID=289966&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guide Communicator Service ===

The charity provides a specialist one-to-one service for people with dual sensory impairment (deafblind). A team of Guide Communicators act primarily as facilitators for people who are deafblind, helping them to interact within their local communities and environment.

===Leisure and social support===

The charity operates a network over 6 local clubs and groups throughout the region. These groups provide social support and activities including art and craft groups and social clubs for older people.

===Digital Kent Talking Newspapers===

Weekly talking newspapers and magazines are provided to almost 2,000 people whose sight is impaired.  The majority of subscribers of this free service are in their 80s and 90s and the service which includes recordings of local news, helps them jeep in touch with local news and events.

===Transcription Service===

KAB offers a service to companies and organisations to make their information accessible to sight impaired people. The service transcribes material into digital audio formats including CD, [[USB]], [[MP3]], SD and DAISY as well as into large print or Braille.

===Training===

KAB in partnership with Canterbury Christ Church University offer a two-year Foundation Degree in Health and Social Care (Visual Impairment Rehabilitation) to provide trained rehabilitation professional specialising in working with people with sight impairments.

==Funding==
Although it received funding from Local Authorities, KAB depends upon donations from public, business and foundation sources to fund its work. As much as a third of its income is received from these voluntary sources.

'''Lernamerdz''' ({{lang-hy|Լեռնամերձ}}, also [[Romanize]]d as '''Lernamerts'''; formerly, '''Ayarlu''') is an Armenian village of 400 people in [[Armavir Province]] that still follows [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[communism]], even after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.

Prior to 1991, year during which the [[Soviet Union]] was dissolved, there were only 5 registered communists in Lernamerdz. 

Today, all of the villagers claim that they adhere to the socialist ideology, and think that "everyone will be happy then and the sun will shine brightly"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav110706b.shtml# EurasiaNet Eurasia Insight - Armenia: Socialism in One Village&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; if communism is reestablished in [[Armenia]]. The village, also called "Little [[Cuba]]" has attracted many communist visitors, because of its special status.

{{Politics of Israel}}

The '''Ministry of Defense''' ({{lang-he-n|מִשְׂרַד הַבִּטָּחוֹן}}, ''Misrad HaBitahon'') of the government of [[Israel]], is the governmental department responsible for defending the State of Israel from internal and external military threats. Its political head is the Defense Minister of Israel, and its offices are located in [[HaKirya]], [[Tel Aviv]].

The Ministry of Defense oversees most of the [[Israeli security forces]], including the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF), [[Israel Military Industries]] (IMI), and [[Israel Aerospace Industries]] (IAI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.gov.il/ Israel Ministry of Defense] {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MOD was established when the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] ended, and the [[British Army]] departed [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and the State of Israel was formed. This ended the rag-tag militia units during British rule and gave way to the formal defense of the Jewish state.

== Minister of Defense == &lt;!--Linked from [[Israeli Minister of Defense]]--&gt;

The Defense Minister of Israel ({{lang-he-n|שַׂר הַבִּטָּחוֹן}}, ''Sar HaBitahon'', ''lit.'' Minister of Security)&lt;ref&gt;In Israel, although the "Security Minister" (שר הביטחון) title is translated in English as "Defense Minister," in Hebrew, the Defense Ministers of other countries are more often referred to as "Defense Minister" ({{lang-he|שר ההגנה}}, ''Sar HaHagana'').&lt;/ref&gt; heads the ministry. The post is considered to be the second most important position in the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli cabinet]], and usually has a Deputy Minister. The Defense Minister is also a permanent member of the [[Security Cabinet (Israel)|Security Cabinet]]. [[Avigdor Lieberman]] of [[Yisrael Beiteinu]] was sworn in on 31 March, 2016 as Israel's new Minister of Defense. 

Due to the great importance of the defense portfolio, [[Prime Minister of Israel|prime ministers]] have often held the position in addition to their prime ministerial duties; seven of the sixteen Defense Ministers to date were also serving Prime Ministers. Five of them ([[Moshe Dayan]], [[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[Ehud Barak]], [[Shaul Mofaz]] and [[Moshe Ya'alon]]) are also former [[Chief of General Staff (Israel)|Chiefs of Staff]] of the Israel Defense Forces.

Amongst the duties of the post, Defense Ministers can request [[administrative detention]]. Because of the intensive work and the tension between the political echelon to the military echelon, frequently disagreements and difference of opinion are created between the Defense Minister and the Chief of Staff.

The '''Movement of Free Citizens''' ({{Lang-el|Κίνημα Ελευθέρων Πολιτών, ΚΕΠ}}), also known by its [[acronym]] '''KEP''', was a short-lived, right-of-center political party in [[Greece]]. It was a personality-driven party, founded and led by [[Dimitris Avramopoulos]]. After resigning from the diplomatic corps in 1993, Avramopoulos began his political career within the conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]]. First a member of the [[Hellenic Parliament]] and then [[List of mayors of Athens|Mayor of Athens]], Avramopoulos became one of the most popular Greek politicians.

In 2001, the conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party was suffering from many internal problems, notably the continuous conflict between its president [[Costas Karamanlis]] and the former Prime Minister [[Constantine Mitsotakis]], and its opposition to the government of the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) seemed ineffective. In this somewhat stagnant situation for the conservative [[Right-wing politics|right]], Avramopoulos decided to step forward and create a party of his own. His personal appeal drove many new people by his side. However, it was clear that KEP's main asset was Avramopoulos' own charisma, who was attracting most of the publicity. Other famous people involved in KEP were ''Eliza Vozenberg'', a [[lawyer]] who served as the party's spokeswoman, and the [[coroner]] ''Mattheos Tsoungas''. The first polls targeting the Greek voters revealed that KEP's percentage in an election would be as high as 24%, something extraordinary and unusual for a new party in Greece. In newer polls, though, the party's percentage went on a free fall, and much of the initial enthusiasm quickly faded away.

To his supporters' annoyance and surprise, in 2002, Avramopoulos unexpectedly terminated KEP's existence as a party, pointing at its financial shortcomings as an excuse. He announced that KEP would continue operating as a [[think tank]], and this effectively marked Avramopoulos' return to New Democracy. Few of KEP's members opposed its president's decision and stated that they would continue working towards their political goals inside the party and without Avramopoulos. However, all attempts to revive KEP were unsuccessful. Most of the party's members followed Avramopoulos' return to New Democracy, few of them went to PASOK, while some others have remained politically inactive ever since, overwhelmed by disappointment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55077">&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Canning was once asked by Mr. Tierney why he did not touch the Poor Law? To which question Mr. Canning replied:—'' "Why do not Governments decide offhand a question growing out of the usages of centuries—interwoven with the habits, and deeply rooted in the prejudices of the people? Of all subjects of legislation on which Governments ought not harshly or prematurely to interfere, without ascertaining, and, if possible, carrying with them the prevailing sentiments of the country, this of the Poor Law appears to me the one on which it would be most undesirable to take a precipitate course.''"&lt;ref name=HC18440704&gt;{{cite journal|title=POOR LAW|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=4 July 1844|volume=76|page=cc319-88}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|c322}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the reign of Elizabeth I until the passage of the [[Poor Law Amendment Act]] in 1834 relief of the poor in England was administered on the basis of a [[Elizabethan Poor Law (1601)|Poor Law]] enacted in 1601.  From the start of the nineteenth century the basic concept of providing poor relief was criticised as misguided by leading political economists and in southern agricultural counties the  burden of poor-rates was felt to be excessive (especially where poor-rates were used to supplement low wages (the 'allowance' or [[Speenhamland system]])).   Opposition to the Elizabethan Poor Law led to a Royal Commission on poor relief, which recommended that poor relief could not in the short term be abolished; however it should be curtailed, and administered on such terms that none but the desperate would claim it.  Relief should only be administered in [[workhouse]]s, whose inhabitants were to be confined, 'classified' (men, women, boys, girls) and segregated.  The Poor Law Amendment Act allowed these changes to be implemented by a Poor Law Commission largely unaccountable to Parliament.  The Act was passed by large majorities in Parliament, but the regime it was intended to bring about was denounced by its critics as (variously) un-Christian, un-English, unconstitutional, and impracticable for the great manufacturing districts of Northern England.  The Act itself did not introduce the regime, but introduced a framework by which it might easily be brought in.  

Opposition to the New Poor Law strictly speaking was resistance to the introduction of the New Poor Law administrative framework; this was chiefly encountered in the industrial North in 1837–9 and overcome after a few riots by a judicious mixture of legal threats and deployment of the military.  Opposition to the New Poor Law in the looser sense of resistance to (and criticism of) key features of the regime recommended by the Royal Commission persisted and eventually became orthodoxy: for example outdoor relief was never abolished in much of the industrial North.  When a prominent West Riding opponent of the New Poor Law died in 1858, the Huddersfield Chronicle wrote "..the controversy closed and English common sense has settled down on the poor-law question somewhat nearer to the views of [[Richard Oastler|Oastler]] and Pitkethly than those of their opponents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The late Mr Lawrence Pitkethly|work=Huddersfield Chronicle|date=23 October 1858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the Elizabethan Poor Law==
Criticism of the Poor Law grew in the early nineteenth century after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] with [[France]], especially among [[Political economy|political economist]]s.

[[File:Thomas Robert Malthus Wellcome L0069037 -crop.jpg|left|thumb|Malthus thought the Old Poor Law encouraged population growth.]]
[[File:Portrait of David Ricardo by Thomas Phillips.jpg|thumb|Ricardo argued that poor-rates reduced wages]]
[[Thomas Malthus]] thought any benevolence to the poor was self-defeating; the only check on the numbers of the poor was poverty. Furthermore, the Poor Law gave a right to relief only in the parish where the claimant had a right of settlement, obtained by birth or by prolonged residence: it undesirably limited the mobility of labour. Without the Poor Law there would be "a few more instances of severe distress," but "the aggregate mass of happiness among the common people would have been much greater than it is at present." However, he was one of the first to advocate so called '[[indoor relief]]' in [[workhouse]]s for the poor as opposed to outdoor relief (handouts in money or in kind, with recipients not under the control of poor-law authorities).

[[David Ricardo]] supported the abolition of the Poor Law in his book 'Principles of Political Economy and Taxation' published in 1817. Any tax raised to pay for [[Social welfare provision|welfare]] such as poor rates reduced the money available to pay wages. He also argued that it rewarded laziness, discouraged people from saving for old age or illness, and encouraged irresponsibly large families.&lt;ref name=Theories&gt;[http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/ssh5.htm#Malthus Andrew Roberts, "Social Science and the 1834 Poor Law: The Theories that Smith, Bentham, Malthus and Owen made", Social science history for budding theorists.  Middlesex University.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edwin Chadwick]], a member of the Royal Commission, and subsequently Secretary of the Poor Law Commission, was a follower of [[Jeremy Bentham]]  (who believed that wages would find their true levels in a free-market system where there was state control to maintain common agreed standards). Chadwick therefore criticized the [[Old Poor Law]] because its decentralised administration meant significant variation in the treatment of paupers.  Chadwick held that the able-bodied poor should be put to work in workhouses which met the condition of [[less eligibility]]: they could not claim outdoor relief as they did under the existing Poor Law. Conditions had to be worse than those for the poorest labourer outside the workhouse, so that people would not want to claim relief. This would decrease the poor rate, allow wages to rise to their true levels, and promote honest toil.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Every penny bestowed, that tends to render the condition of the pauper more eligible than that of the independent labourer, is a bounty on indolence and vice." -1832 Royal Commission&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=swlJwIZDwH4C&amp;pg=PA64  George R. Boyer, ''An Economic History of the English Poor Law, 1750–1850''], Cambridge University Press (1990) {{ISBN|0-521-36479-5}}  Quoting ''Parliamentary Papers'' 1834, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Opposition to introduction of the New Poor Law ==

=== The 1832 Royal Commission ===
Alarmed at the cost of poor relief in the southern agricultural districts of England (where in many areas it had become a semi-permanent top-up of labourers' wages - the 'allowance system','Roundsman system', or 'Speenhamland system' ) Parliament had set up a [[Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws 1832|Royal Commission into the operation of the Poor Laws]].  Its report had recommended sweeping changes &lt;ref name=PLC1834&gt;{{Citation| first =Nassau| last =Senior| first2 =Edwin| last2 =Chadwick| title =Poor Law Commissioners’ Report of 1834| year =1834| place =London| publisher =H.M. Stationery Office| url =http://oll.libertyfund.org/simple.php?id=1461}}
&lt;/ref&gt; unsurprisingly similar to those favoured by Chadwick: 
[[File:Sampson Kempthorne workhouse design for 300 paupers.jpg|thumb|1835 model design of a workhouse to hold 300 paupers segregated into four classes]]
* Out-relief of the able-bodied poor should cease - relief should be given only in workhouses, and upon such terms that only the truly indigent would accept it. "Into such a house none will enter voluntarily; work, confinement, and discipline, will deter the indolent and vicious; and nothing but extreme necessity will induce any to accept the comfort which must be obtained by the surrender of their free agency, and the sacrifice of their accustomed habits and gratifications. "&lt;ref name=PLC1834/&gt; 
::Whilst this recommendation was a solution to existing problems consistent with 'political economy', there was little consideration in the report of what new problems it might give rise to .  There was little practical experience to support it - only four of the parishes reporting had entirely abolished out-relief; their problem cases could well have simply been displaced to neighbouring parishes&lt;ref&gt;Speech of Mr Paulett Scrope (c1321)in {{cite journal|title=POOR-LAWS AMENDMENT—COMMITTEE.|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=26 May 1834|volume=23|pages=cc1320-49|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1834/may/26/poor-laws-amendment-committee|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Different classes of paupers should be segregated ; to this end parishes should pool together in unions, with each of their poorhouses dedicated to a single class of paupers and serving the whole of the union. "the separation of man and wife was necessary, in order to ensure the proper regulation of workhouses"&lt;ref&gt;Speech of Lord Althorp (c 339) in {{cite journal|title=POOR LAWS' AMENDMENT—COMMITTEE.|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=9 June 1834|volume=24|pages=cc324-40|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1834/jun/09/poor-laws-amendment-committee|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::In practice, most existing workhouses were ill-suited to the new system (characterised by opponents as locking up the poor in 'Poor Law bastiles'), and many poor law unions soon found they needed a new purpose-built union workhouse. Their purpose being to securely confine large numbers of the lower classes at low cost, they not unnaturally looked much like prisons; this was not unwelcome to the New Poor Law authorities:"At present their prison-like appearance, and the notion that they are intended to torment the poor inspires a salutary dread of them."&lt;ref&gt;Letter of Mr Tufnell (Assistant Poor Law Commissioner) printed in 1836 Report of Poor Law Commission and quoted (c1821) in {{cite journal|title=POOR LAW|journal=Hansard House of Lords Debates|date=6 August 1844|volume=76|page=cc1811-43|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1844/aug/06/poor-law|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
* The new system would be undermined if different unions treated their paupers differently; there should therefore be a central board with powers to specify standards and to enforce those standards; this could not be done directly by Parliament because of the legislative workload that would ensue.  
:: This arrangement was simultaneously justified as required to give absolute uniformity country-wide and as allowing regulations to be tailored to local circumstances without taking up Parliament's time.  
* Mothers of illegitimate children should receive much less support; poor-law authorities should no longer attempt to identify the fathers of illegitimate children and recover the costs of child support from them
:: It was argued that penalising fathers of illegitimate children reinforced pressures for the parents of children conceived out of wedlock to marry, and generous payments for illegitimate children indemnified the mother against failure to marry.  "The effect has been to promote bastardy; to  make want of chastity on the woman's part the shortest road to obtaining either a husband or a competent maintenance; and to encourage extortion and perjury"&lt;ref&gt;'Mr Cowell's report' quoted in {{cite news|title=The Amendment of the Poor Laws|work=The Examiner|date=20 April 1834}} (J W Cowell was one of the Assistant Commissioners of the Royal Commission)&lt;/ref&gt;

===1834 Poor Law Amendment Act===
Acting on the recommendations of the Royal Commission, Parliament passed the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which however did not directly enact the recommendations.  On illegitimacy it did not follow the recommendations of the Commission; under the New Poor Law fathers of illegitimate children could still be pursued; with however the crucial difference that under the old poor law the mother's sworn testimony was sufficient to establish paternity; under the New Poor Law the mother's word alone was insufficient; there had to be corroborative evidence.{{efn| Clearly not modern paternity testing : "It was enough, as in cases of seduction, that the corroborating evidence should merely amount to this—that the parties had been seen together under circumstances which, if they were so inclined, would have favoured a criminal intercourse between them." at c1840 of &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=POOR LAW|journal=Hansard House of Lords Debates|date=6 August 1844|volume=76|page=cc1811-43|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1844/aug/06/poor-law|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; }} To implement the other recommendations the Act set up a three-man Poor Law Commission, an 'at arms' length' [[quango]] to which Parliament delegated the power to make appropriate regulations, without making any provision for effective oversight of the Commission's doings. Local poor-rates payers still elected their local Board of Poor Law Guardians and still paid for local poor law provisions, but those provisions could be specified to the Board of Guardians by the Poor Law Commission; where they were the views of the local rate-payers were irrelevant.
&lt;!-- ===Criticism of the Act=== 
* Some people felt that the [[Poor Law Amendment Act]] was too centralised, and indeed it was a huge change from the parochial, paternalistic Elizabethan Poor Law. The commissioners were seen as not understanding life in rural areas and being too focused on [[London]] and other industrial centers.
* Some rich landowners felt that it violated the old [[social contract]] between the rich and the poor, by making it less [[paternalistic]].
* Rural ratepayers feared an increase in taxes to pay for [[workhouse]]s when in rural areas handouts were, per head, cheaper. Many Tory gentry and farmers opposed the Act but there were also pro-Poor Law landowners including [[Sir Robert Peel]] and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]].&lt;ref name="The anti-Poor Law campaign"/&gt;--&gt;

===Opposition to the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act===
The radical MP [[William Cobbett]] voted against the Act, asserting that the poor had an automatic right to relief and that the Act aimed to "enrich the landowner" at the expense of the poor. The 'Tory Radical' [[Richard Oastler]] personally lobbied Tory leaders (including the Duke of Wellington) to oppose the Act.  Oastler's objections were that the Act pursued aims dictated by political economy by un-Christian treatment of the poor (and particularly of the married poor: "whom God hath joined together let no man part asunder"), and to ensure this was done with consistent heartlessness was setting up an unconstitutional body.  Oastler told the Duke "if that Bill passes, the man who can produce the greatest confusion in the country will be the greatest patriot, and I will try to be that man".&lt;ref name=Damn!&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oastler|first1=Richard|title=Damnation!

=== Resistance to the New Poor Law structures ===
[[File:Thomas Frankland Lewis.jpg|thumb|One of the 'Somerset House Despots': Sir Thomas Frankland Lewis, (Chairman of Poor Law Commission 1834–39)]]

====South of England==== 
The new dispensation was implemented progressively, starting with the southern counties of England, whose problems it was designed to address.  There it achieved a considerable reduction in the poor rates with only minor disturbances (In [[Buckinghamshire]] when paupers were transported 3 miles from [[Chalfont St. Giles]] to [[Amersham]], the [[Riot Act]] had to be read. In [[East Anglia]] new [[workhouse]]s were attacked.&lt;ref name="povertyhealth"&gt;Rees, R. Poverty and Public Health 1815–1948, Heinemann, 2001. {{ISBN|0-435-32715-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;) "Partial riots have occurred in different counties; but, by the aid of small parties of the Metropolitan Police ... occasionally aided by the support of military force, these disturbances have been put down, without any considerable injury to property.&lt;ref&gt;'page 5 of the Poor-law Commissioners' second report' as quoted by John Fielden MP at c 1015 of {{cite journal|title=POOR-LAW AMENDMENT ACT|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=24 February 1837|volume=36|page=cc986-1052|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1837/feb/24/poor-law-amendment-act#S3V0036P0_18370224_HOC_11|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;

====North of England====
There had been no great dissatisfaction with the existing Poor Law in the North, the burden of poor relief being lower (in 1832 under the old Poor Law Lancashire, with a population about 280% that of Kent,  had poor relief costs only about 80% those of Kent).&lt;ref&gt;data given as from the ''British Almanack'' of 1832 in a letter from 'An Admirer of your Paper' {{cite news|title=Poor Laws|work=County Chronicle, Surrey Herald and Weekly Advertiser for Kent|date=25 February 1834}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rate of increase in the cost of poor-relief was no of concern either: in Sheffield the cost of poor-relief in 1833 was half what it had been ten years before.&lt;ref name=Tweedy /&gt;{{efn| Later in the 1830s it was argued that the perception that poor-rates were a steadily increasing burden was only locally true; over the nation as a whole, in the last 20 years wealth had increased faster than the cost of poor-relief &lt;ref&gt;original reference not to hand, but see cc399-389 in {{cite journal|title=POOR-LAW COMMISSION|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=8 February 1841|volume=56|pages=cc375-451|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1841/feb/08/poor-law-commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Correspondingly there had been no urgent need to implement the New Poor Law.  Not until January 1837 were the first steps taken to introduce the system into the textile districts of Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire by setting up 'poor law unions' and electing Boards of Guardians for them. The Poor Law Boards were then to appoint a clerk  to administer whatever system of relief was specified for that Union by the central Commission.&lt;br /&gt;
Inquiries in the West Riding of Yorkshire by an assistant to the Royal Commission had led him to note that out-door relief was an important (and relatively cheap) way of coping with the trade cycle. When trade was slack manufacturers could lay off 500 hands at once - this was a scale for which it would be impracticable to provide workhouse accommodation;&lt;ref name=Tweedy&gt;{{cite news|last1=|title=Working of the Poor Laws|work=Sheffield Independent|date=5 April 1834}} "extract from the report of Mr Tweedy, Assistant Poor Law Commissioner, whose district was the West-Riding of Yorkshire"&lt;/ref&gt; where unemployment was likely to be temporary (e.g. caused by the trade cycle or sickness) the eventual cost (and inconvenience) of re-establishing a household on leaving the workhouse had to be borne in mind and could well suggest the wisdom of out-door relief.&lt;ref name=Tweedy/&gt; Furthermore, where the head of a household containing child wage-earners became unemployed, it would be more sensible (and cheaper) to supplement the household income by a judicious amount of out-door relief than to move the family to the poorhouse.&lt;ref name=Tweedy/&gt;{{efn| Factory children were always in demand in the textile districts; particularly after the Factory Act of 1833 reduced their (legally permitted) hours of work}}  Hand-loom weavers, a group of workers now habitually in great distress, had very low earnings; not because their wages were supplemented by out-door relief, but because they were competing with power-looms; nothing would be gained by forcing them into the workhouse or to turn to some occupation for which they would not have the required physical strength.   The Assistant Commissioner also noted that diet of West-Riding poorhouse inmates was not a deterrent; there seemed to be a deliberate policy of 'the best of everything, and plenty of it'.&lt;ref name=Tweedy /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Richard Oastler, by James Posselwhite after Benjamin Garside-crop.jpg|thumb|Richard Oastler: "a gross and wicked law .. if it was truth, the Bible was a lie"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Huddersfield Election|work=Leeds Intelligencer|date=29 April 1837}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] The Poor Law Commission intended (or said they intended) to allow the new Poor Law Boards in manufacturing areas to continue out-door relief, but opponents of the New Poor Law held that the safest way to defend out-door relief and the rest of the ''status quo'' was to prevent the New Poor Law administrative framework becoming established.  Hence they strove to prevent new Poor Law Boards being established (or to elect Guardians hostile to the New Poor Law who would obstruct or delay clerks to Poor Law Boards being appointed), since their existence would allow the Poor Law Commission to specify changes in the regime of existing poorhouses and greatly facilitate the cessation of out-door relief should the Commission change its mind ( or not be telling the truth).

In the Northern industrial towns, a variety of organisations (trade unions, [[Ten Hours Movement|Short Time Committees]], [http://www.victorianweb.org/history/reform.html Radical associations] )were already in existence whose (often overlapping) memberships  were generally opposed to the New Poor Law.  Local Anti-Poor Law Associations sprang up able to readily mobilise large numbers for protest meetings against the Act, and against its local implementation. Many of the leaders of the anti-poor law movement had previously been prominent in the [[Ten Hours Movement]]
 
[[Richard Oastler]] wrote letters to Yorkshire newspapers like the ''[[Leeds Intelligencer]]'' and to the national Radical press denouncing the Poor Law Amendment Act as being cruel and unchristian. He spoke in similar vein at anti-New Poor Law meetings; his first speech (to a mass meeting in Huddersfield) was subsequently published under the (representative) title of [https://archive.org/details/damnationeterna00oastgoog Damnation! Eternal damnation to the fiend-begotten 'coarser-food', new Poor Law !]).  Huddersfield was notably slow to set up an effective New Poor Law administration, large crowds/mobs gathering outside (or breaking up) meetings of the Guardians, but never with enough violence to lead local Tory magistrates to ask for military assistance to preserve order.  (When Whig magistrates were appointed and the military deployed, the Guardians meeting was subject to a large peaceful picket which terminated with the crowd giving a cheer for the troops for having had to turn out on a miserable January night and a whip-round to give them a shilling each to buy something warm and comfortable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Enforcement of the New Poor Law Act at Huddersfield|work=Leeds Times|date=3 February 1838}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

John Fielden attempted to prevent the Act from being implemented in his area, threatening to close the family firm down unless the Guardians of the Todmorden Poor Law Union resigned. When they didn't the Fielden mills duly closed, throwing nearly 3,000 out of work.  The Guardians stood firm, troops were moved into the area, and after a week Fieldens re-opened (paying their employees as normal for the week not worked)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Whig Poor Law in Todmorden|work=The Champion|date=22 July 1838}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some townships refused to recognise the authority of the Guardians. and instructed (or intimidated) their 'overseer of the poor' to ignore the Guardians' instructions.   The overseer of Langfield was fined £5 for disobeying the Guardians and two constables sent from Halifax to distrain goods to that value.  The constables were surrounded by a mob summoned from two of Fielden's mills (supplemented by navvies building the Manchester &amp; Leeds Railway), roughly treated and made to promise never to return.  The following week a mob again gathered in the belief that another attempt at distraint was to be made; when this did not happen, they attacked the houses of various guardians and supporters of the New Poor Law, causing damage put at over £1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Todmorden Riots|work=Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser|date=1 December 1838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extra-Parliamentary opposition to the New Poor Law regime ==
While there were protests in towns such as [[Oldham]], [[Huddersfield]], and [[Bradford]] (where the Poor Law Guardians had to be protected by troops after riots against the Act), in other areas the New Poor Law administrative framework was set in place with much less difficulty. Even in Huddersfield the new administrative framework was in place within two years.  However, opposition to the New Poor Law did not cease once its structures were in place.  Outside Parliament, agitation and mass meetings continued.  Horror stories of (mis)-treatment of paupers under the New Poor Law not only featured in the speeches of its opponents; they also circulated in Chartist newspapers such as Augustus Beaumont's [[Northern Liberator]] and Feargus O'Connor's [[Northern Star (chartist newspaper)|Northern Star]] and were collected in [[George R. Wythen Baxter]]'s ''[[The Book of the Bastilles]]''.  Not all the stories were entirely accurate, and some propaganda was very black; a document recommending infanticide and alleged to be the work of the Poor Law Commission was published as the [[Book of Murder]].

===Relationship to Chartism===
The ease with which the Reform Parliament had passed the Poor Law Act of 1834, its refusal to pass a Ten-Hour Bill and the contrast between the zeal with which the New Poor Law was brought in and the failure to enforce the Factory Act of 1833 were powerful arguments that only the fundamental political changes sought by Chartism would produce a Parliament which paid more than lip-service to the interests of the working classes.  Consequently, the anti-poor law movement became almost inextricably linked with [[Chartism]]. The leaders of the Anti-Poor Law movement differed in their response to Chartism.  Oastler would have nothing to do with it, and continued to speak only on the Poor Law and on Factory Reform (but to audiences of largely Chartist tendencies).  He called upon his hearers to exercise their right to bear arms (but not to bring them to meetings); he also ''warned'' (but was careful not to ''threaten'') that a social cataclysm would result ''if'' the government were to further oppress the poor.   [[Rayner Stephens|J R Stephens]], a Methodist minister who had been prominent in both the Factory Reform and Anti-Poor Law movements addressed Chartist meetings, giving much the same advice as Oastler, and was a delegate to the National Convention, but later said  "I would rather walk to London on my bare knees, on sharp flint stones to attend an Anti-poor Law meeting, than be carried to London in a coach and six, pillowed with down to present that petition - the "national petition" to the House of Commons"&lt;ref name=LastSermon&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr Stephens' Last Sermon|work=Northern Star|date=17 August 1839}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stephens was less prudent than Oastler in his speeches and failed to persuade those coming to his meetings to leave their guns at home.  Consequently, when the Government cracked down on Chartist activity after the Todmorden Riots (in which - despite the insinuations of the ''Manchester Guardian'' - Fielden could not be implicated), Stephens was imprisoned for eighteen months for unlawful assembly.&lt;ref name=TrialMC&gt;{{cite news|title=''Nisi Prius'' court Thursday - Trial of the Rev J R Stephens|work=Manchester Courier|date=17 August 1839}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fielden deprecated the use of force, or any hint of the use of force, and hence advised against the acquisition of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Dinner to Mr Fielden MP|work=Manchester Times|date=9 June 1838}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, he had striven to prevent Anti-Poor Law meetings alienating non-Chartist sympathisers by discussing other Chartist demands, but at the height of the Chartist agitation of 1838 he abandoned this position. Instead, thinking that the poor law would never be reformed until parliament had been remodelled along the lines called for by the Chartists' National Petition, he spoke at Chartist meetings and urged Chartists to concentrate on the fundamental reforms they sought and not allow themselves to be bought off with concessions on the Poor Law and Factory Reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The great meeting of the Radicals of Lancashire|work=London Standard|date=25 September 1838}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the failure of the National Petition, and the consequent drift of Chartism away from 'moral force' to 'physical force', (which Fielden could not support) he reverted to his original position; that (once again) the Anti-Poor Law movement had a better chance of success if it remained distinct from more general Chartist agitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-Poor Law Meeting|work=The Charter|date=30 June 1839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the crack-down, the Commissioners admitted that they were influenced by the agitation: "The depressed condition of the manufacturing population, to which we have already adverted, and the disquietude of the public mind occasioned by the chartist riot at Newport, in Monmouthshire, rendered us extremely unwilling to take any step in the manufacturing districts of Lancashire which might have even a remote tendency to produce a disturbance, or which might be used by designing persons as a pretext for agitation"&lt;ref&gt;"the last report of the Commissioners" quoted by Fielden at cc663-664 in {{cite journal|title=POOR-LAW COMMISSION|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=29 March 1841|volume=57|page=cc660-702|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1841/mar/29/poor-law-commission|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on workhouses===
On two occasions in the 1840s, newly built workhouses were sacked by rioters, but on neither occasion was the riot clearly single-issue:
* In 1842, during the [[1842 General Strike|Plug Plot Riots]], the Stockport Union Workhouse at Shaw Heath was attacked and sacked by rioters, being eventually dispersed by the Cheshire Yeomanry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Riots in the Manufacturing Districts|work=London Standard|date=15 August 1842}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1843, during the [[Rebecca Riots]] of 1842–43 a force of several thousand Rebeccaites, including 300 farmers on horseback entered [[Carmarthen]] demanding not only the removal of toll-gates, but also the abolition of tithes and church rates, fairer rents and 'the alteration of the present poor-law to which they expressed the most bitter hostility'.  They then proceeded to attack the workhouse, entered it and were sacking it when the military (a troop of the 4th Dragoons) arrived and restored order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rebecca Riots - Attack upon the Carmarthen Workhouse and Capture of the Ringleaders|work=London Standard|date=21 June 1843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mounting opposition in Parliament==
[[File:John Fielden 1845.jpg|thumb|John Fielden: MP for Oldham and determined Parliamentary opponent of the New Poor Law]]Criticism slowly mounted: when the Whigs introduced a Poor Law Amendment Bill in 1841 to extend the Commission's life, MPs complained of the pettiness of some of the rules called for by the Poor Law Commission (e.g. workhouse inmates to take their meals in silence), of the refusal of the Commissioners to allow Boards of Guardians much discretion, and of the way the Commission had evaded Parliamentary scrutiny. A general election occurred before the Bill was passed, and the Conservatives came to power, with some of their MPs stating that they owed their seats to the opposition they had professed to the New Poor-law; the government, however, came forward with a Bill to extend the Commission to 1847, and to make minor amendments to the Poor Law.  Whilst there continued to be cross-party Front Bench support for the New Poor Law (in 1844 in [[Coningsby]], [[Benjamin Disraeli]] mocked Peel's 'sound Conservative government' as 'Tory men and Whig measures') Conservative malcontents such as Disraeli were alive to the consequent opportunity to undermine Peel by allying themselves with the opposition to unpopular Whig measures.  The Bill made very slow progress (opponents made lengthy speeches; Fielden repeatedly moved adjournment of the debate), and many clauses were dropped in order to secure its passage before the existing authorisation of the Commission lapsed.  The previous proceedings of the Poor Law Commission were not endorsed unequivocably : ("My Lords, I don't mean to say that I approve of every act that has been done in carrying this bill into operation. I think that in many cases those who had charge of the working of the bill have gone too far"&lt;ref&gt;Duke of Wellington (c620) moving the Lords Second Reading of the Bill {{cite journal|title=AMENDMENT OF THE POOR-LAW|journal=Hansard House of Lords Debates|date=26 July 1842|volume=65|page=cc619-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;) it was now stressed that the virtue of the Commission was that it supported diversity, rather than that it was necessary to achieve uniformity; administratively 'special rules' were to be as far as possible consolidated into general rules laid before Parliament. A further Poor Law Amendment Act was passed in 1844; its main effect was to again revise the treatment of unmarried mothers: in Committee stage many amendments seeking to relax the poor law regime were rebuffed by the Home Secretary on the argument that - correctly understood - the existing rules and regulations of the Poor Law Commission already permitted the relaxation sought.

===Scottish Poor Law Commission critical of 'workhouse test'===  
A Commission of Enquiry into the Scottish poor laws (which, in principle, unlike the English did not give relief to the able-bodied poor&lt;ref name=HC18440704 /&gt;{{rp|c376}}{{efn|not withstanding which, relief ''was'' given to the able-bodied poor in areas badly affected by the [[Highland Potato Famine]]}}), set up in 1843 and reporting in May 1844 came to conclusions which differed significantly from its English predecessor, being critical of the effect of the 'workhouse test' on those subjected to it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;" It did not promote the development of any intellectual energy, neither did it foster feelings of manliness and independence. Its influence dries up the last impulses of social life. It destroys all feelings of self-respect and alienates the inmates from almost every sympathy which either in equals or superiors is inherent in rightly constituted natures. Repulsion and discomfort being the sole means by which this workhouse test works—that repulsion and discomfort must be carefully kept up for its operation.&lt;ref name=HC18440704/&gt;{{rp|c370}}"&lt;/blockquote&gt; and of the argument that as a 'self-acting test' it had the great virtue of removing any need for moral judgement on applicants: &lt;blockquote&gt;"We hold that no just system of Poor Laws can exist, excluding, in the distribution of relief, the consideration of character—which should be a fundamental consideration. The man who has conducted himself with activity and industry for the bettering of his condition, and has only fallen through misfortune, not by fault, has a just title to the sympathy of his fellow-men. And not only that the necessary relief be cheerfully accorded, but full scope given for all the ministrations of charity to his comfort.&lt;ref name=HC18440704/&gt;{{rp|c371}}" &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Andover workhouse scandal and subsequent inquiries==
[[File:Andover workhouse.jpg|thumb|left|Andover workhouse]]In 1845, it was alleged that paupers at the Andover Union workhouse employed in crushing bones were (regardless of age or state of decay) eating marrow from the bones and gnawing off any shreds of meat still adherent.  When reported to the guardians, they had neither intervened, nor informed the Poor Law Commissioners. {{efn|The initial complainant had therefore gone to his MP, who had raised the matter in Parliament}}  The Assistant Poor Law Commissioner for the area (a Mr Parker) was sent to investigate, and found the allegations to be largely true, if slightly over-stated. This had been going on for some time without being detected by the Poor Law Commission's supervisory regime (in the first instance Mr Parker). The Home Secretary had on a number of occasions told the House of Commons that grinding bone was work of too penal a nature to be carried out by workhouse inmates, and the Poor Law Commission would see that his wish that it should cease was acted upon.  The crushed bones were mostly sold to the guardians(for use as fertiliser) at a price which did not represent good value for the rate-payer.

===Public hearings by Assistant Poor Law Commissioner===
[[File:Sir James Graham 2nd Bart First Lord Admiralty.jpg|thumb|Sir James Graham - Home Secretary at the time]]On the instructions of the Commission Parker then heard in public (poorly specified) charges against the master of the workhouse of diverting some of the paupers' rations for his own use, improper behaviour towards pauper girls, sleeping with inmates, conducting prayers when drunk, etc., but nothing relating to the bone-crushing. Parker was critical (many papers thought over-critical) of the prosecution witnesses, even criticising the workhouse medical officer for not keeping his books in the form prescribed by the Poor Law Commission, when the books were in the form directed by the Andover Guardians, and Parker was more demonstrably at fault since his routine duties included inspecting workhouse books to ensure that they met the Poor Law Commission's requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Andover Workhouse Abominations|work=Northern Star and Leeds General Advertiser|date=20 September 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearings were adjourned to give the master of the workhouse time to prepare his defence and witnesses, but before the time allowed was up the Commissioners stopped the enquiry, recommended suspension of the master and (on the assumption that that recommendation would be acted upon) suggested complainants prosecute him on specimen charges at Quarter Sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspension of the official enquiry at the Andover Union|work=Oxford University and City Herald|date=13 September 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complainants declined; seeing this not as an escalation of proceedings, but an attempt to evade a verdict against the master, pointing out that whilst the charges against the master (if true) showed him unfit to hold his post, they were unlikely to support a conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Inquiry at the Andover Union|work=Morning Post|date=13 September 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Times'', saying the behaviour of the Somerset House set was like that of a cheat at cards, held open hearings of witnesses to the bone-crushing and -gnawing.&lt;ref&gt;untitled editorial item under general heading of {{cite news|title=Saturday, 13 September 1845|work=Manchester Times|date=13 September 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|extensive extracts from that evidence can be found in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Bone-Knawing Atrocity|work=Northern Star and Leeds General Advertiser|date=20 September 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The guardians voted not to suspend the master;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Inquiry at the Andover Union|work=London Standard|date=15 September 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt; his wife was however suspended, having physically attacked witnesses against her husband. The Commission then ordered the immediate resumption of the inquiry, allowing no further time for the master to prepare his defence.:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Inquiry at the Andover Union|work=London Standard|date=17 September 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt; the resumed enquiry was now attended by a shorthand writer taking an accurate record and reporting it to the Home Secretary (no accurate record of proceedings had previously been taken, leading to arguments about what previous witnesses had said).  No sooner had the enquiry resumed than it was terminated by the master's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Andover Union Inquiry|work=London Standard|date=25 September 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assistant Poor Law Commissioner 'resigns' and retaliates===
[[File:Edwin Chadwick Wellcome L0000064.jpg|thumb|Edwin Chadwick (Secretary to the Poor Law Commission) in later life]]The guardians asked the master to stay on until a permanent replacement was chosen; Parker insisted this was unacceptable and recommended a former master of the Oxford Union workhouse (a Mr C Price) as a ''locum''. The ''Times'' promptly revealed that Price had resigned from the Oxford post when serious allegations had been made against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=General Domestic Intelligence: Andover Again !|work=Bradford Observer|date=16 October 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn| He had been master at Oxford 1840-44.  He had started off on the wrong foot with some of his Guardians &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oxford Workhouse|work=Oxford Journal|date=20 March 1841}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1844 had been dismissed by a meeting of the Guardians, applied for the job when advertised and been selected as his own replacement by a differently attended board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Election of Master of the Oxford Workhouse|work=Oxford Journal|date=8 June 1844}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Poor Law Commission then started an inquiry into the allegations used to support his dismissal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Board of Guardians|work=Oxford University and City Herald|date=29 June 1844}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The allegations investigated before Price's resignation ''might'' not be the most serious ones: at Andover, allegations were investigated in the order in which they were made, not in order of decreasing gravity) Price (even before obtaining the Oxford mastership) was owed £3000 by Mr Mott.&lt;ref name=RCG1846 /&gt;}} Price had resigned his post at Oxford whilst complaints against him were being investigated by an Assistant Poor Law Commissioner; The Poor Law Commission originally claimed that a report had been submitted to them, but gone unread because of Price's resignation; they then admitted than once Price had resigned the investigation was abandoned without their knowledge by the Assistant Commissioner, and no record of it (or indication that it had been undertaken) kept by the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Political Examiner: The Poor-Law Board|work=The Examiner|date=1 November 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Poor Law Commission insisted on Price resigning and instructed Parker to resign.  He did,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Political : Poor Law Commissioners|work=Preston Chronicle|date=25 October 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then published a pamphlet (''Letters to the Right Hon. [[Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet|Sir James Graham]], Bart,; on the Subject of Recent Proceedings connected with the Andover Union''   By H. W. Parker, Esq. Barrister at Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Literature|work=Hampshire Advertiser|date=13 December 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;) justifying himself and detailing conversations with the Commission and with the Home Secretary which alleged that
* although the Home Secretary had communicated his views on bone-crushing to the Commission in 1842, and [[Edwin Chadwick]] (Secretary to the Commission) had circulated a paper reaching the same conclusion, the Commission had issued no rule or direction on the matter, because there was disagreement within the Commission as to whether they had powers to do so 
* the Home Secretary had met Parker and a Poor Law Commissioner so they could construct an agreed narrative reflecting as little discredit upon themselves as possible&lt;ref name=Andoverdebate /&gt;

===Select Committee on the Andover Union===
It was separately alleged that the Commission had attempted to discredit a Yorkshire MP critical of it by sending an Assistant Poor Law Commissioner (Charles Mott) to inspect and unfavourably report upon the conditions in and management of a workhouse of which the MP was a guardian; that report had then been quoted (in good faith) by the Home Secretary in the Commons.&lt;ref name=Andoverdebate&gt;{{cite journal|title=THE ANDOVER UNION.|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=5 March 1846|volume=84|page=cc625-76|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1846/mar/05/the-andover-union|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Against the advice of the Home Secretary (who dismissed the affair as a "workhouse squabble") the House of Commons voted for a Committee to enquire into the management of the Andover workhouse, and into the conduct of the Poor Law Commissioners and Mr Parker&lt;ref name=Andoverdebate/&gt; Further questions arose as to the dismissal of the Assistant Commissioner for Wales (the reasons given by the Commissioners and the Home Secretary being markedly different)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=DISMISSAL OF MR.

Sir Frankland Lewis, the first Chairman of the Commission  gave evidence that Chadwick had written an order that bells should not be tolled at the funeral of a pauper, and - having waited until Lewis (who Chadwick knew was opposed to any such ban) was absent - induced the Commissioners to issue the order.&lt;ref name=JoshuaFielden&gt;{{cite journal|title=PAUPERISM AND VAGRANCY (ENGLAND). MOTION FOR A SELECT COMMITTEE|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=10 May 1869|volume=196|page=cc471-538|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1869/may/10/motion-for-a-select-committee#S3V0196P0_18690510_HOC_39|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It became apparent that the important business of the Commissioners had not been conducted (as the Act establishing them required) by minuted meetings as a Board, nor had adequate records been kept of their decisions and the reasons for them.  Chadwick's evidence to the Committee confirmed what had previously generally been taken to be a wild allegation by the wilder opponents of the New Poor Law: that in 1834 the Commission had indicated in a secret briefing paper for ministers that they intended to completely taper-out out-door relief for all classes of paupers (not just the able-bodied), to coarsen the diet of paupers, reduce its quantity, and enforce strict regulations.&lt;ref name=JoshuaFielden /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;untitled editorial item under general heading {{cite news|title=Summary|work=Bradford Observer|date=6 August 1846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ministers had repeatedly denied the existence of any such paper or any such plan. The findings of the committee (quoted verbatim in &lt;ref name= SelectComRepMC&gt;{{cite news|title=Report of Select Committee on Andover Union|work=Morning Chronicle|date=21 August 1846}}&lt;/ref&gt;) characterised the Commissioners' conduct on matters within the committee's terms of reference as "irregular and arbitrary, not in accordance with the statute under which they exercise their functions, and such as to shake public confidence in their administration of the law", going on to note that the committee had in passing heard worrying evidence on matters outside its terms of reference on which it would be improper to base findings.&lt;ref name= SelectComRepMC /&gt;

== Poor Law Commission replaced by Poor Law Board==
The Peel administration fell in the aftermath of the repeal of the Corn Laws, and the new (Whig) Home Secretary denied that the Andover Committee had demonstrated malice, recklessness or illegality in the proceedings of the Commission but promised that it would be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=THE POOR LAW COMMISSION|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=26 February 1847|volume=90|page=cc529-38|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1847/feb/26/the-poor-law-commission|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Poor Law Amendment Act of 1847 replaced the Poor Law Commission with a [[Poor Law Board]], the President of which sat in the Commons.  The Annual Report of the Board would be laid before Parliament (the Commission's Annual Report had been to the Home Secretary); the nine Assistant Commissioners remained in post but were re-titled Inspectors, and three further Inspectors were recruited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=POOR LAW ADMINISTRATION BILL.|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=3 May 1847|volume=92|page=cc340-58|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1847/may/03/poor-law-administration|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Poor Law Board took up its duties in December 1847; in preparation for this a [http://www.workhouses.org.uk/gco/gco1847.shtml Consolidated General Order] detailing the 'general rules' which it intended to apply to poor relief were issued in July 1847 by the outgoing Commission.&lt;ref name=nuregWC&gt;{{cite news|title=Regulations of the New Poor-Law Commissioners|work=Worcestershire Chronicle|date=29 December 1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The powers of the Board were not materially different to those of the Commission, but they were applied in a different spirit: for example, whereas the Commission had to be applied to for ( and had repeatedly refused) authorisation of any deviation from the normal workhouse diet on Christmas Day,{{efn|Formerly custom and practice for prisoners and paupers alike.  So at Christmas 1840 at Leicester the prisoners in the borough jail  were given beef and plum pudding by order of the magistrates, those in the county jail beef and ale by order of the High Sheriff, the debtors in the county jail were presented by a private benefactor with an excellent Christmas dinner of plum pudding roast beef and ale and "the poor in the Billesdon Union Workhouse were plentifully supplied with plum pudding, roast beef, ale and tobacco on Christmas day, by a subscription entered into by the Guardians of the above Union for that purpose, the Poor Law Commissioners having given strict orders there should be no feasting or treating in any union on that day"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christmas Donations|work=Leicester Journal|date=1 January 1841}}&lt;/ref&gt; }} the new general rules explicitly noted that this was permitted.&lt;ref name=nuregWC /&gt;  The 'New Poor Law' remained, but its underlying intent had been largely defeated. At the end of 1849, the Chartist paper the ''Northern Star'' was hopeful of achieving an extension of the franchise, drawing encouragement from the fate of the other great agitations going on when the ''Star'' had been founded twelve years before: ..now, when the Ten Hours''"Bill"'' has become an ACT; now, when the Poor Law ''Commission'' has become a Poor Law BOARD; and the ultra-Malthusianism of the one has been replaced by a policy more in accordance with humanity and reason".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Our Anniversary|work=Northern Star and Leeds General Advertiser|date=17 November 1849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- ==Opposition to the New Poor Law==
Most opposition to the Poor Law was not organised and therefore had little chance of succeeding against the will of the government. Furthermore, the deportation of the [[Tolpuddle martyrs]] had the effect of halting organised opposition to the poor law. However, an unlikely association of wealthy, paternalistic, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tories]] and working class radicals was formed, and although it failed quickly, it would again find itself rebuilt to a degree in the governments of [[Benjamin Disraeli]] years later. Until then, many working-class men turned to [[Chartism]] as a result.&lt;ref name="povertyhealth"/&gt;

===Charles Dickens===
The writings of [[Charles Dickens]], in particular his novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', were critical of the [[workhouse]] system. Dickens himself had been a pauper in childhood. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3289">The '''Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion''' is the name of an international agreement signed at the First International Conference on Health Promotion, organized by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and held in [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]], in November 1986.&lt;ref name="Ottawa"&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/healthpromotion/conferences/previous/ottawa/en/index.html The Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion.] Adopted on 21 November 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; It launched a series of actions among international organizations, national governments and local communities to achieve the goal of "[[Health For All]]" by the year 2000 and beyond through better [[health promotion]].

==Context==
The thirtieth WHO [[World Health Assembly]], held in 1977, had highlighted the importance of promoting [[health]] so that all the international citizens had an "economically productive" level of health by the year 2000. Further, a localised European taskforce developed a strategy for [[health promotion]] in the [[WHO]] [[Europe]]an Region.

==Action areas of the Ottawa Charter==
Five action areas for health promotion were identified in the charter:&lt;ref name="Ottawa"/&gt;
# '''Building healthy public policy''' 
# '''Creating supportive environments'''
# '''Strengthening community action'''
# '''Developing personal skills'''
# '''Re-orienting [[health care]] services toward prevention of illness and promotion of health'''

The basic strategies for health promotion were prioritized as:
* Advocate: Health is a resource for social and developmental means, thus the dimensions that affect these factors must be changed to encourage health.
* Enable: [[Health equity]] must be reached where individuals must become empowered to control the determinants that affect their health, such that they are able to reach the highest attainable quality of life.
* Mediate: Health promotion cannot be achieved by the health sector alone; rather its success will depend on the collaboration of all sectors of government (social, economic, etc.) as well as independent organizations (media, industry, etc.).

==Developments after Ottawa==
Internationally:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/healthpromotion/conferences/7gchp/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Pacem in Terris'' Peace and Freedom Award''' is a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] peace award which has been given annually since 1964, in commemoration of the 1963 [[encyclical]] letter '' [[Pacem in terris]]'' (Peace on Earth) of [[Pope John XXIII]].

The '''Parsley Massacre''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''''el corte''''' "the cutting";&lt;ref name="windows"&gt;{{cite web | last= Wucker | first= Michele | title= The River Massacre: The Real and Imagined Borders of Hispaniola | work= Windows on Haiti | url= http://www.windowsonhaiti.com/wucker1.shtml  | accessdate= 2007-12-16 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928160208/http://www.windowsonhaiti.com/wucker1.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; | archivedate= 28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haitian Creole]]: '''''kout kouto-a''''' "the stabbing"&lt;ref&gt;Lauro Capdevila, ''La dictature de Trujillo : République dominicaine, 1930–1961'', Paris, L'Harmattan, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;) took place in October 1937 against [[Haitians in the Dominican Republic|Haitians living in the Dominican Republic]]'s northwestern frontier and in certain parts of the contiguous [[Cibao|Cibao region]].

carried out the massacre on the direct orders of the Dominican dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]]. Haitian President [[Élie Lescot]] put the death toll at 12,168; in 1953, the Haitian historian Jean Price-Mars cited 12,136 deaths and 2,419 injuries. In 1975, [[Joaquín Balaguer]], the Dominican Republic's interim Foreign Minister at the time of the massacre, put the number of dead at 17,000. Other estimates compiled by the Dominican historian [[Bernardo Vega]] went as high as 35,000.&lt;ref name=Wucker/&gt;

In the spring of 1938 Trujillo ordered a new campaign against Haitians, this time in the southern frontier region. The operation occurred over several months, and thousands were forced to flee. Although known to Dominicans simply as ''el desalojo'' (the eviction), this campaign also resulted in hundreds reportedly killed. And unlike in the northern frontier area, some witnesses recalled Dominican civilians cooperating in the killing.&lt;ref name=Turits/&gt;{{rp|169}}

The name ''parsley massacre'' stems from the use of the word ''perejil'', Spanish for [[parsley]], as a [[shibboleth]] to distinguish native speakers from Haitians.&lt;ref name="Introspections" /&gt;

==Events==
[[File:Rafael Trujillo 1933.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Depiction of [[Rafael Trujillo]] on a 1930s stamp]]
Rafael Trujillo, a proponent of [[antihaitianismo|anti-Haitianism]], made his intentions towards the Haitian community clear in a short speech he gave 2 October 1937 at a dance in his honor in [[Dajabón Province|Dajabón]]. He said, {{quote|For some months, I have traveled and traversed the border in every sense of the word. I have seen, investigated, and inquired about the needs of the population. To the Dominicans who were complaining of the depredations by Haitians living among them, thefts of cattle, provisions, fruits, etc., and were thus prevented from enjoying in peace the products of their labor, I have responded, 'I will fix this.' And we have already begun to remedy the situation. Three hundred Haitians are now dead in [[San Francisco de Bánica|Bánica]]. This remedy will continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard Lee |last=Turtis |title=A World Destroyed, A Nation Imposed: The 1937 Haitian Massacre in the Dominican Republic |journal=Hispanic American Historical Review |volume=82 |issue=3 |year=2002 |pages=589–635 [p. 613] |doi= 10.1215/00182168-82-3-589}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Trujillo reportedly was acting in response to reports of Haitians stealing cattle and crops from Dominican borderland residents. According to some sources, the massacre killed an estimated 20,000 Haitians&lt;ref name="Introspections"&gt;pg 78 – {{cite book | last = Robert Pack (editor), Jay Parini (Editor)| authorlink = | title = Introspections|edition= |page= 2222 | publisher = PUB| isbn= }}&lt;br/&gt;''On 2 October 1937, Trujillo had ordered 10,000 Haitian cane workers executed because they could not roll the "R" in perejil the Spanish word for parsley.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alan_Cambeira"&gt;{{cite book | last = Cambeira| first = Alan | authorlink = | title = Quisqueya la bella|edition=1996 | page=182 | publisher = M.E. Sharpe| isbn= 1-56324-936-7}}&lt;br/&gt;''anyone of African descent found incapable of pronouncing correctly, that is, to the complete satisfaction of the sadistic examiners, became a condemned individual. This holocaust is recorded as having a death toll reaching thirty thousand innocent souls, Haitians as well as Dominicans.''&lt;/ref&gt; living in the northern frontier—clearly at Trujillo's direct order. However, the exact number is impossible to calculate for many reasons. Among them is the fact that, although the Dominican Army murdered many of the victims in public view, they carried out most of the slayings en masse in isolated areas, leaving either no witnesses or just a few survivors. Another reason why the number of victims is unknown is that an untold but very great number of their bodies ended up either in the sea, where sharks consumed their remains, or in mass graves, where acidic soil degraded them, leaving nothing for forensic investigators to exhume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roorda|first1=Eric Paul|title=Historical Dictionary of the Dominican Republic|date=2016-04-28|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trujillo commanded his army to kill all Haitians living in the Dominican Republic's northwestern frontier and in certain parts of the contiguous Cibao region. Between October 2 and October 8, hundreds of Dominican troops, who came mostly from other areas of the country, poured into the region.&lt;ref name=Turits/&gt;{{rp|161}} These armed forces killed Haitians with rifles, machetes, shovels, knives, and bayonets. Haitian children were reportedly thrown in the air and caught by soldiers' bayonets, then thrown on their mothers' corpses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dividing Hispaniola: The Dominican Republic's Border Campaign against Haiti, 1930-1961|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PI2oCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT218&amp;lpg=PT218&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780822981039|author1=Paulino|first1=Edward|date=2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some died while trying to flee to [[Haiti]] across the [[Artibonite River]], which has often been the site of bloody conflict between the two nations.&lt;ref name="Turtis, 590"&gt;Turtis, 590.&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors who managed to cross the border and return to Haiti told stories of family members being hacked with machetes and strangled by the soldiers, and children dashed against rocks and tree trunks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Galván|first1=Javier A.|title=Latin American Dictators of the 20th Century: The Lives and Regimes of 15 Rulers|date=2012|publisher=McFarland|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of military units from outside the region was not always enough to expedite soldiers' killings of Haitians. U.S. legation informants reported that many soldiers "confessed that in order to perform such ghastly slaughter they had to get 'blind' drunk."&lt;ref name=Turits/&gt;{{rp|167}} Several months later a barrage of killings and repatriations of Haitians occurred in the southern frontier.

Lauren Derby claims that a majority of those who died were born in the [[Dominican Republic]] and belonged to well-established Haitian communities in the borderlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lauren |last=Derby |title=Haitians, Magic, and Money: Raza and Society in the Haitian-Dominican Borderlands, 1900 to 1937 |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |volume=36 |issue=3 |year=1994 |page=508 |doi=10.1017/S0010417500019216 }}[http://hhidr.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/derby_article.pdf on line copy]

Derby explains: "This point is important because, by the Dominican constitution, all those born on Dominican soil are Dominican. If this population was primarily migrants, then they were Haitians, thus making it easier to justify their slaughter. However, our findings indicate that they were legally Dominicans, even if culturally defined as Haitians since they were of Haitian origin." (Derby, p.508)&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is difficult for anyone to ascertain a victim's place of birth, especially considering that, in most cases, their identities are unknown, and their births may not have been officially recorded. Furthermore, Haiti has historically awarded citizenship by ''[[Jus sanguinis]]'', making anyone with a Haitian parent a Haitian citizen, whereas from as early as 1929 until 2014, the [[Dominican Republic]] followed a restricted ''[[Jus soli]]'' citizenship policy, which excluded from this privilege illegal residents and anyone not having legal permanent residency status.&lt;ref name=TC016813&gt;{{cite web|last=Tribunal Constitucional |first= |title=Sentencia TC/0168/13 |url=http://tribunalconstitucional.gob.do/sites/default/files/documentos/Sentencia%20TC%200168-13%20-%20C.pdf |accessdate=5 May 2014 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812200410/http://tribunalconstitucional.gob.do/sites/default/files/documentos/Sentencia%20TC%200168-13%20-%20C.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Virgilio|title=Erroneous objections to the Dominican constitutional ruling on citizenship|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/12/erroneous-objections-dominican-constitutional-ruling-citizenship-2013121010421638902.html|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hispaniola 1697-1795.png|thumb|300px|The French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] in the Western coast, and the Spanish colony of [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] in the rest of Hispaniola island.]]
The [[History of the Dominican Republic|Dominican Republic]], formerly the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo, is the eastern portion of the island of [[Hispaniola]] and occupies five-eighths of the land while having ten million inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John P. |last=Augelli |title=Nationalization of Dominican Borderlands |journal=Geographical Review |volume=70 |issue=1 |year=1980 |page=21 |doi=10.2307/214365|jstor=214365 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Haiti, the former French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]], is on the western three-eighths of the island&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=de9NDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Vascular Surgery: A Global Perspective |editor=Dardik, Alan |page=341 |year=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783319337456 |accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5wBsDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Current Affairs November 2016 eBook |editor=Josh, Jagran |page=93 |year=2016 |accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has almost exactly the same population, with an estimated 500 people per square mile.&lt;ref&gt;Augelli, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

This has forced many Haitians onto land too mountainous, eroded, or dry for productive farming. Instead of staying on lands incapable of supporting them, many Haitians migrated to Dominican soil, where land hunger was low. While Haitians benefited by gaining farm land, Dominicans in the borderlands subsisted mostly on agriculture, and benefited from the ease of exchange of goods with Haitian markets.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Due to inadequate roadways connecting the borderlands to major cities, "Communication with Dominican markets was so limited that the small commercial surplus of the frontier slowly moved toward Haiti."&lt;ref&gt;Augelli, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; This threatened Trujillo's regime because of long-standing border disputes between the two nations. If large numbers of Haitian immigrants began to occupy the less densely populated Dominican borderlands, the Haitian government might try to make a case for claiming Dominican land. Additionally, loose borders let contraband pass freely, and without taxes between nations, depriving the Dominican Republic of tariff revenue.

Furthermore, the Dominican government saw the loose borderlands as a liability in terms of possible formation of revolutionary groups that could flee across the border with ease, while at the same time amassing weapons and followers.&lt;ref&gt;Turtis, 600.&lt;/ref&gt;

The extraordinary violence of that unfortunate episode also reflects the potential depths of [[Antihaitianismo|Dominican anti-Haitianism]]. In fact, anti-Haitianism has grown and, above all, it has spread during the last sixty years until the present. These migrants have been subjected to exploitation and continued abuses of the human rights. Moreover, Dominican anti-Haitianism has a remarkable racial dimension, since Haitians have been identified as "blacks" in the Dominican Republic, in contrast to Dominicans who, since colonial times, have seldom assumed that kind of collective identity (although the vast majority has not been identified - nor has it been identified by others - as "whites").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://people.duke.edu/~eec7/turits.pdf|title=A World Destroyed, A Nation Imposed: The 1937 Haitian Massacre in the Dominican Republic|author=Richard Lee Turits|date=2002|format=pdf|access-date=16 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809125418/http://people.duke.edu/~eec7/turits.pdf|archive-date=9 August 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repercussions==
Despite attempts to blame Dominican civilians, it has been confirmed by U.S. sources that "bullets from [[Krag]] rifles were found in Haitian bodies, and only Dominican soldiers had access to this type of rifle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Valentina |last=Peguero |title=The Militarization of Culture in the Dominican Republic: From the Captains General to General Trujillo |location=Lincoln |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=2004 |page=114 |isbn=0803204345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Haitian Massacre, which is still referred to as ''el corte'' (the cutting) by Dominicans and as ''kouto-a'' (the knife) by Haitians, was, "...a calculated action on the part of Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo to homogenize the furthest stretches of the country in order to bring the region into the social, political and economic fold,"&lt;ref name="Turtis, 590"/&gt; and rid his republic of Haitians.

Thereafter, Trujillo began to develop the borderlands to link them more closely with urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;Turtis, 623.&lt;/ref&gt; These areas were modernized, with the addition of modern hospitals, schools, political headquarters, military barracks, and housing projects—as well as a highway to connect the borderlands to major cities.

Additionally, after 1937, quotas restricted the number of Haitians permitted to enter the [[Dominican Republic]], and a strict and often discriminatory border policy was enacted. Dominicans continued to deport and kill Haitians in southern frontier regions—as refugees died of exposure, malaria and influenza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Eric Paul |last=Roorda |title=The Dictator Next Door: The Good Neighbor Policy and the Trujillo Regime in the Dominican Republic, 1930–1945 |location=Durham |publisher=Duke University Press |year=1998 |page=132 |isbn=082232234X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, U.S. president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and Haitian president [[Sténio Vincent]] sought reparations of [[United States dollar|$]]750,000, of which the Dominican government paid $525,000 (US$ {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|525000|1937|r=2}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars). Of this 30 dollars per victim, survivors received only 2&amp;nbsp;cents each, due to corruption in the Haitian bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="Madison_Smartt_Bell"&gt;p.41 – {{cite journal | first = Madison Smartt | last = Bell| authorlink = |title= A Hidden Haitian World | volume= 55 | issue = 12 | date = 17 July 2008 | page= |work= New York Review of Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Condemnation of the massacres was not limited to international sources, as a number of Trujillo's exiled political opponents also publicly spoke out against the events. In November 1937, four anti-Trujillistas were declared "unworthy Dominicans" and "traitors to the Homeland" for their comments – [[Rafael Brache]], José Manuel Jimenes, [[Juan Isidro Jimenes Grullón]], and Buenaventura Sánchez.&lt;ref name="caribe"&gt;Naya Despradel (August 13, 2016), [http://www.elcaribe.com.do/2016/08/13/fello-brache-tom-perez "De Fello Brache a Tom Pérez"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227160136/http://www.elcaribe.com.do/2016/08/13/fello-brache-tom-perez |date=27 February 2017 }} {{Link language|es}}, ''El Caribe''.

==In popular culture==
*[[Edwidge Danticat]]'s novel ''[[The Farming of Bones]]'' chronicles the Haitians' escape from the Dominican Republic following the massacre and the spread of [[antihaitianismo]]. Edwidge Danticat's short story "Nineteen Thirty-Seven", from ''Krik? Krak!'' also refers to the Massacre River as a site that divides Haiti from the Dominican Republic, and where the protagonist's grandmother is killed.&lt;ref&gt;Danticat, Edwidge. ''Krik? Krak!'', New York: Soho Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Rita Dove]] drew inspiration from the massacre for her poem "Parsley".&lt;ref&gt;Rita Dove, [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=172128 "Parsley"] from ''Museum'' (Pittsburgh: Carnegie Mellon University Press, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;
*The massacre, along with many other incidents of the Trujillo era, is discussed in the book ''[[The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao]]'' by Dominican-American author [[Junot Díaz]].
*A fictional Haitian woman named Chucha is discussed as having escaped from this massacre in the book ''[[How The Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents]]'' by [[Julia Alvarez]].
*In the novel ''Massacre River'', Haitian author [[René Philoctète]] tells the story of the massacre through his narrative of a Dominican man trying to save his Haitian wife.&lt;ref name="goodreads"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/430007.Massacre_River|title=Massacre River by René Philoctète – Reviews, Discussion, Bookclubs, Lists|publisher=goodreads.com|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The massacre is a focus of [[Jacques Stephen Alexis]]' 1955 novel ''General Sun, My Brother''.
*The Parsley Massacre is chronicled in the novel ''El masacre se pasa a pié'' (The massacre crossed on foot) by Dominican author Freddy Prestol Castillo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://vanguardiadelpueblo.do/1981/02/20/fallece-el-abogado-y-escritor-freddy-prestol-castillo/ | title=Fallece el abogado y escritor Freddy Prestol Castillo | work=Vanguardia del Pueblo |language=es| date=February 20, 1981 | accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Roxane Gay]]'s short fiction, "In the Manner of Water or Light", a woman reveals to her daughter and granddaughter how she became pregnant with her only child in the [[Dajabón River]] during the parsley massacre.
*When [[Mario Vargas Llosa]]'s novel ''[[The Feast of the Goat]]'', mentions 'What do five, ten, twenty thousand Haitians matter when it's a matter of saving an entire people', it refers to the justification of the 1937 ethnic cleansing parsley massacre of all Haitians in the Dominican Republic border area.

'''People for Successful Corean Reunification''' (PSCORE) is a [[non-governmental organization]] based in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], and [[Washington D.C.]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="PSCORE.org"&gt;[http://pscore.org/en/ Official PSCORE Website]&lt;/ref&gt; PSCORE addresses potential barriers to [[Korea reunification]], suggests alternatives, and works to improve the situation of [[North Korean defectors]] in South Korea and [[China]] to bridge the gap between South Korea, [[North Korea]], and the [[international community]]. The organization is made up of North and South Korean staff, interns and volunteers from South Korea and abroad, and North Korean defectors. While PSCORE provides news coverage on North Korea and helps defectors become South Korean citizens, a unique aspect is that educational programs are offered for North Korean defectors.&lt;ref name="Pscore's got the word on helping new defectors"&gt;{{cite news |title=Pscore's got the word on helping new defectors |first=Eldo |last=Kim |url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2917916 |newspaper=[[JoongAng Daily]] |location= |date=March 17, 2010 |accessdate= March 17, 2018   |page= |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20180818004141/http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2917916 |archivedate=2018-08-18 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In October 2006, PSCORE was established by young North Korean defectors, South Korean university students, and [[foreigners in Korea]] interested in improving [[human rights in North Korea]] and the reunification of the [[Korean peninsula]]. The organization uses ‘C’ in the acronym ‘PSCORE’ to represent the pre-20th century spelling "Corea", when the two countries were one.&lt;ref name="PSCORE.org" /&gt;

==Objectives==
The organization encourages harmony and understanding between the two Koreas through educational programs, awareness campaigns, and discussion panels.&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news |title= N. Koreans may be frustrated with government and likely rise of Kim Jong Eun |first= Chico|last=Harlan |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/08/AR2010090806040.html |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |location= |date=September 8, 2010 |accessdate= March 17, 2018   |page= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619051722/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/08/AR2010090806040.html |archivedate=2017-06-19 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address the possible obstacles to [[reunification]] of North and South Korea, the organization suggests solutions to resolve such obstacles by creating space for discussing issues related to reunification, [[human rights]], and North Korean [[democratization]].&lt;ref name="PSCORE.org" /&gt; It also seeks to fill gaps in the existent assimilation aid for North Korean defectors.&lt;ref name="Pscore's got the word on helping new defectors"/&gt;
The organization is composed of those who share a common interest and passion for [[Korean reunification]], [[human rights in North Korea]], and to see [[North Korean defectors]] become self-supporting.&lt;ref name="DPRK Opportunities"&gt;[http://nknews.org/2010/04/news-article-translator-remote/ News Article Translator (Remote)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823081659/http://nknews.org/2010/04/news-article-translator-remote/ |date=2011-08-23 }} NK News. 6 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==PSCORE's Work==

===Human Rights Data Collection and Analysis===
Detailed evidence of human rights abuses in North Korea is collected through interviews with North Korean defectors living in South Korea. The data is used for written and visual depictions of the human rights crisis in North Korea to be accessible for the public. PSCORE recently published a book entitled 'Only the Freedom to Breathe' which features testimonies which were obtained through direct interviews from North Korean defectors of the human rights abuses they saw and experienced before escaping to South Korea. Each case is recorded onto a Google Maps page which displays the time, location, violation type, violation organ, account of incident and offender and victim information.

===UN ECOSOC Consultative Status===
&lt;nowiki&gt;In 2012, PSCORE received United Nations Economic and Social Council Consultative status. Consultative status enables an NGO to submit written statements to the United Nations Human Rights Council, speak at the sessions, attend UNHRC meetings and hold parallel events in the boundaries of the UN during UNHRC sessions. &lt;/nowiki&gt;

===International Conferences and Seminars===
In Seoul there has been an International Youth Conference on North Korean Human Rights, and another human rights conference every April during North Korea Freedom Week. The conferences and seminars hosted by PSCORE aim to raise awareness and educate people on topics related to [[reunification]] of the [[Korean peninsula]]&lt;ref name="idealist.org"&gt;[http://www.idealist.org/view/org/KNzK54JTJpFP/ PSCORE] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323091209/http://www.idealist.org/view/org/KNzK54JTJpFP/ |date=2012-03-23 }} Idealist.org. November 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[human rights in North Korea]].

===Educational Programs===
In Seoul, PSCORE supports North Korean defectors through education as a response to the North Korean situation where English is not taught or encouraged. Through one-on-one English tutoring and weekly English classes, [[North Korean defectors]] have resources and support to learn English for the educational standard in South Korea is increasingly adopting English as a requirement. [[Volunteering|Volunteer]]s tutor also in essay writing, science, and math. Some North Korean defectors when enrolled in college are surprised at the amount of English required in their studies.&lt;ref name="Pscore's got the word on helping new defectors"/&gt; Seventy-percent of PSCORE students seek help mostly in English as it is increasingly being used in South Koreans’ daily lives and work places.&lt;ref name="Pscore's got the word on helping new defectors"/&gt;

===Helping Refugees in China===
PSCORE provides basic necessities for North Korean women defectors in [[China]] such as food, medical supplies, and warm winter clothes. Orphaned children escaping from North Korea live in constant fear of being sent back. Without any legal rights, they cannot receive [[citizenship]] and cannot receive medical attention or education. PSCORE supports such children to acquire legal status to attend school and the basic necessities of housing, clothing, and financial support. There are also safety houses run by PSCORE to protect escapees from the [[PRC government]]. These houses have food, water, and electricity and are protected locations monitored by PSCORE staff.

===Fundraising Concerts===
Every 2–3 months PSCORE has been hosting fundraising rock concerts entitled 'Rock out for a Good Cause' at Club Freebird in the Hongdae area of Seoul. The concerts have featured both Korean and expat bands and have been very successful in helping PSCORE gain local recognition for its work, raise funds for various PSCORE programs and giving local talent a stage to play in front of up to 160 people.

===Online Campaigns===
Through online campaigning, PSCORE has held contests for university students to creatively address the issue of [[democratization]] in North Korea. South Korean students have submitted original videos and essays reflecting their views of North Korea.&lt;ref name="PSCORE UCC Contest"&gt;"[http://www.reportworld.co.kr/contest/view.html?link=special&amp;c_no=348 PSCORE UCC Contest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330100529/http://www.reportworld.co.kr/contest/view.html?link=special&amp;c_no=348 |date=2012-03-30 }}" ''Report World Korea'' December 20, 2009. '''(Korean)'''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Street Campaigns===
In 2013, PSCORE began campaigns around Seoul to educate the public on the human rights abuses occurring within North Korea. The campaigns usually feature 20 different information boards which outline different issues. PSCORE volunteers also talk with interested people in order to give them a greater understanding of the current situation. So far campaigns have taken place at Gimpo International Airport, Dongdaemun History and Culture Park Station, Yongsan Station, Itaewon Station, Hongik University and Seoul National University of Education.

'''The Public Diplomacy Council of Catalonia''' (in [[Catalan language]] '''Consell de Diplomàcia Pública de Catalunya'''; acronym: '''DIPLOCAT''') – previously known as the Patronat Catalunya Món – is a public-private consortium set up by the Catalan government, the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Generalitat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.enciclopedia.cat/EC-GEC-0420184.xml|title=Patronat Catalunya-Món|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Enciclopèdia Catalana]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ara.cat/politica/Diplomacia-Govern-Catalunya-mon_0_814118708.html|title=El Govern crea un Consell de Diplomàcia pública per divulgar i promoure la causa catalana al món|last=Colomer|first=M.|date=20 November 2012|newspaper=[[Ara (newspaper)|Ara]]|access-date=15 September 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Mateos|first2=R.|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was devoted to promoting international awareness of [[Catalonia]] within the international community.&lt;ref name="EFEjun13"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eldiario.es/catalunya/politica/diplomacia-catalana-Paris-explicar-consulta_0_138936350.html|title=La diplomàcia catalana inicia a París una gira per explicar la consulta|last=|first=|date=2 June 2013|newspaper=Eldiario.es|accessdate=15 September 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Royo i Mariné has been the Secretary General of the Diplomacy Council since 14 February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://premsa.gencat.cat/pres_fsvp/AppJava/notapremsavw/detall.do?id=183510|title=Albert Royo és nomenat secretari general de DIPLOCAT, l'organisme de referència en la diplomàcia pública del país|last=|first=|date=4 February 2013|work=Sala de premsa|publisher=Generalitat de Catalunya|location=Barcelona|language=Catalan|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arbetet.se/2017/09/01/katalanskt-avgorande-narmar-sig/]&lt;/ref&gt; It was closed on October 27, 2017 by the [[government of Spain]] in the application of [[article 155]] of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spanish Constitution]].

DIPLOCAT organized academic events to discuss both internationally relevant topics within Catalonia with international guests and the Catalan independence process in universities around the world.

{{selfref|For the Wikipedia system function, see [[Wikipedia:Purge]]}}

In [[history]], [[religion]] and [[political science]], a '''purge''' is a removal of people who are considered undesirable by those in power from a government, another organization, their team owners, or society as a whole. A group undertaking such an effort is labeled as '''purging''' itself. Purges can be either nonviolent or violent; with the former often resolved by the simple removal of those who have been purged from office, and the latter often resolved by the [[imprisonment]], [[exile]], or [[murder]] of those who have been purged.

== Historical use of the term ==

The earliest use of the term dates back to the [[English Civil War]]'s [[Pride's Purge]].  In 1648-1650, the moderate members of the English [[Long Parliament]] were purged by the army. Parliament would suffer subsequent purges under the Commonwealth including the purge of the entire [[House of Lords]]. Counter-revolutionaries such as royalists were purged as well as more radical revolutionaries such as the [[Levellers]]. After the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], obstinate republicans were purged while some{{which|date=December 2013}} fled to [[New England]].

The [[Shanghai massacre of 1927]] and the [[Night of the Long Knives]] of 1934, in which the leader of a political party turned against and killed a particular section or group within the party, are commonly called "purges" while mass expulsions on grounds of [[racism]] and [[xenophobia]], such as that of the [[Crimean Tatars]] and the [[Japanese-American internment]] are not.

The term "purge" is often associated with [[Stalinism]]. While leading the USSR, [[Joseph Stalin]] imprisoned in [[Gulag]]-labor camps and executed, i.e. purged, "wreckers", or citizens accused of plotting against [[Communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hunt, Lynn|title=The Making of the West: Peoples and Cultures, Vol. C: Since 1740|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|isbn=978-0312465100|year=2008|edition=3rd|page=846|display-authors=etal}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin initiated the most notorious of the [[Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU purges]], the [[Great Purge]], during the 1930s.

Though sudden and violent purges are notable, most purges do not involve immediate execution or imprisonment, for example the periodic massive purges of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia#Membership|Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] on grounds of apathy or dereliction, or the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service|purge of Jews]] and [[German resistance to Nazism|political dissenters]] from the German Civil Service in 1933-1934. [[Mao Zedong]] and his associates purged much of the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s leadership, including the head of state, President [[Liu Shaoqi]] and the then-[[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], [[Deng Xiaoping]], beginning in 1966 as part of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. In [[Maoism|Maoist]] states, sentences usually involved hard labor in ''[[laogai]]'' camps and executions. Deng Xiaoping acquired a reputation for returning to power after having been purged several times.

[[List of leaders of North Korea|North Korean leaders]] [[Kim Il-sung]], [[Kim Jong-il]], and [[Kim Jong-un]] have each periodically purged their political rivals or perceived threats, beginning in the 1950s. The most senior Kim purged those who opposed his son's succession to the supreme leadership of North Korea. Kim Il-sung's most prominent purge occurred during the "[[August Incident]]" in 1956, when the pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese [[Yanan faction]]s of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK) attempted to depose Kim. Most of those involved in the plot were executed while some others fled to the USSR and China. While some purges were carried out under Kim Jong-il, they were not as common as they were under his father/son. Kim Jong-un purged a number of high-ranking officials and generals installed by his father Kim Jong-il in the former's first years in power, including, most prominently, his uncle [[Jang Sung-taek]]. 

After [[France]]'s liberation by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1944, the [[Free French]] and particularly the [[French Resistance]] carried out purges of former collaborationists, the so-called "[[Vichy France|vichystes]]". The process became known in legal terms as ''[[épuration légale]]'' ("legal purging"). Similar processes in other countries and on other occasions included [[denazification]] and [[decommunization]].

After the [[Cuban Revolution]] in 1959, [[Fidel Castro]] of [[Cuba]] often purged those who had previously been involved with the [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista regime]]. Purges often involved the execution of the condemned. Castro periodically carried out party purges thereafter. One prominent purge was carried out in 1989, when a high-ranking general named [[Arnaldo Ochoa]] was sentenced to death and executed by [[firing squad]] on charges of [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]]. Purges became less common in Cuba during the 1990s and 2000s.

== In the 21st century ==
{{main article|2016–2018 purges in Turkey}}
Purges have seldom occurred during the 21st century. However, after the failed [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]], the government of Turkey began a purge against members of its own civil service and the [[Turkish Armed Forces]]. The purge ostensibly focused mainly on public servants and soldiers alleged to be part of the [[Gülen movement]], the group the government blamed for the coup. As part of the purge, about 50,000 officials, including thousands of judges, were dismissed and detained.

'''Radio Freedom''' was the radio [[propaganda]] arm of the [[African National Congress]] during the anti-[[Apartheid]] struggle from the 1970s through the 1990s. It was the oldest liberation radio station in Africa.&lt;ref name="AMR"&gt;{{cite journal

Listening to Radio Freedom in Apartheid-era [[South Africa]] was a crime carrying a penalty of up to eight years in prison.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1918">'''Regional Information Sharing Systems''' ('''RISS''') is an information-sharing program funded by the U.S. Federal government whose purpose is to connect databases from local and regional law enforcement so that they can use each other's data for criminal investigations.&lt;ref name="riss-official-site"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riss.net/|title=Regional Information Sharing Systems|work=RISS (Official Site)|accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iir-riss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iir.com/RISS/|title=Regional Information Sharing Systems (RISS)|work=Institute for Intergovernmental Research|accessdate=17 December 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111065209/http://www.iir.com/RISS/|archivedate=11 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, RISS created [[RISSNET]], a network to interconnect many local, state, regional, and tribal law enforcement databases.&lt;ref name="riss-overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riss.net/Default/Overview|title=RISS Overview|work=RISS (Official site)|accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, RISSNET was connected with the FBI's [[Law Enforcement Online]] system.&lt;ref name="riss-overview" /&gt;

In 2003, the [[National Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan|National Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan (NCISP)]] declared that RISSNET would be the official "backbone" for all unclassified, but sensitive criminal intelligence data traffic.&lt;ref name="riss-overview" /&gt; Later that year, members were also given access to the [[Automated Trusted Information Exchange|Automated Trusted Information Exchange (ATIX)]] database, which contains information on [[homeland security]] and [[terrorist]] threats.

'''Restorative leadership''' embraces the interconnectedness of all life and acts for the highest benefit to all. Like in the [[Hippocratic oath]], restorative leadership strives to do no harm and to heal the Earth, the communities and ourselves, moving toward a balanced expression of universal values and natural laws. Restorative leadership is visionary, resolved, and creative in generating yet unfulfilled possibilities.&lt;ref name=steffen2012&gt;Steffen, Seana. 2012. “Beyond Environmental Leadership to Restorative Leadership: An Emerging Framework for Cultivating Resilient Communities in the 21st Century.” In D.R.

Restorative Leadership is a framework for empowering leadership that elevates the quality of life on Earth. It goes beyond dominant leadership ethics of the 20th Century and emphasizes the value and efficacy of [[community-based network]]s, [[place-based knowledge]], as well as systemic and co-creative problem-solving to establish the conditions for global [[sustainability]] and collective [[well-being]].

==History and Framework==
*Although restorative leadership practices have been used widely for millennia, the term ''restorative leadership'' was coined and defined by Dr. Seana Steffen in 2009. The concept was popularized by the Restorative Leadership Institute,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.restorative-leadership.org/Restorative_Leadership_Institute_Home.html&lt;/ref&gt; an organization founded by Steffen in 2011.
*Discerned from decades of fieldwork and a multi-year study of high impact leaders, the multidimensional and holistically integrated framework of restorative leadership includes the following distinctions:&lt;ref name=steffen2012/&gt;
**A belief in the potential and power of community;
**Participatory skills that empower self-organizing capacities and confidence while forwarding current priorities for collective well-being;
**A substantive understanding of social-ecological interconnections that can be shared with and taught to others clearly and concisely;
**An ability to engage individuals and communities in bridging that understanding of interconnection to a recognition of personal and collective rights and responsibilities in the web of relatedness.
*The following assumptions underlie the restorative leadership framework:
**The state of our world is a reflection of the quality of our leadership.
**The world is in a state of overshoot and collapse. 
**Empowered action starts wherever we are and with whatever is in front of us, whether in an African village or a presidential office, by embodying the best of what is possible for life on Earth as we co-create our world.
**Humanity is basically good and there is infinite potential to fulfill.
*According to Steffen, the framework includes principles, practices and guiding questions. 
*Restorative leadership cultivates [[Resilience (organizational)|resilience]].&lt;ref name=steffen2012/&gt;

==Principles and Practices==
'''Valuing and empowering community''' – Restorative leadership utilizes a community-centered approach, engaging social networks to forward hopeful possibilities and leveraging communal assets to achieve goals. Traditional, indigenous and local knowledge is sought and valued.

'''Holism and making connections''' – Restorative leadership demonstrates an understanding of the interdependence and interconnectedness of life that can be articulated with great clarity, whether grounded in an intuitive sense or based in scientific knowledge. There is stewardship of personal, societal and global well-being.

'''Rights, responsibilities and practicing participatory engagement''' – Restorative leadership is distinct from command and control leadership by emphasizing mutuality and co-creation. It promotes self-organizing capacity, collective well-being, and resilience by facilitating, guiding and empowering.

'''Social capital through engaging networks''' - With restorative leadership, connecting relationally and seeing connections holistically builds trust and familiarity across social networks. Engaging vertical and horizontal networks lays a foundation of social capital that translates to adaptive capacity in times of disaster or stress.

'''Listening deeply and self-authorizing''' – Being and living into the work involves listening deeply to oneself and others for innate intelligence and collective wisdom. Restorative leadership authorizes one’s own and community leadership to fulfill new possibilities.

'''Holding the long view''' – The relationship between daily life experience and broader environmental and social concerns becomes evident through restorative leadership practices. Sustainability and future generations are taken into account.

==Application and Lessons==
The following are some examples of high-impact leaders who demonstrate the principles and practices of restorative leadership transforming 21st century issues:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3948">The '''right to development''' was first recognized in 1981 in Article 22 of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] as a definitive individual and collective right.  Article 22(1) provides that: "All peoples shall have the right to their economic, social and cultural development with due regard to their freedom and identity and in the equal enjoyment of the common heritage of mankind."

The right to development was subsequently proclaimed by the [[United Nations]] in 1986 in the "Declaration on the Right to Development," which was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolution 41/128.  The Right to development is a [[group right]] of peoples as opposed to an [[individual right]], and was reaffirmed by the 1993 [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]].  

The right to development is now included in the mandate of several UN institutions and offices.

The Preamble of the Declaration on the Right to Development states "development is a comprehensive economic, social, cultural and political process, which aims at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active, free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom."

==The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action==
The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] states in Article 10 "The [[World Conference on Human Rights]] reaffirms the "right to development", as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development, as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights.
As stated in the Declaration on the Right to Development, the human person is the central subject of development. While development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, the lack of development may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human rights. States should cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development. The international community should promote an effective international cooperation for the realization of the right to development and the elimination of obstacles to development. Lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level, as well as equitable economic relations and a favorable economic environment at the international level."

==The Rio Declaration==
The [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]], also known as Rio Declaration or the G.R.E.G, recognizes the right to development as one of its 27 principles. Principle 3 of the Declaration states "The right to development" must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations."

==Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples==
The [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] recognizes the right to development as an indigenous peoples' right. The declaration states in its preamble that the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] is "Concerned that indigenous peoples have suffered from historic injustices as a result of, inter alia, their colonization and dispossession of their lands, territories and resources, thus preventing them from exercising, in particular, their right to development in accordance with their own needs and interests."

Article 23 elaborates "Indigenous peoples have the right to determine and develop priorities and strategies for exercising their "right to development". In particular, indigenous peoples have the right to be actively involved in developing and determining health, housing and other economic and social programmes affecting them and, as far as possible, to administer such programmes through their own institutions."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7971">'''Social equity''' is a concept that applies concerns of [[justice]] and fairness to social policy. Since the 1960s, the concept of social equity has been used in a variety of institutional contexts, including [[education]] and [[public administration]].

==Overview==
The concept of social equity can be traced back to the works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]. Definitions of social equity can vary, but all focus upon the ideals of [[justice]] and fairness. Equity in modern societies involves the role of public administrators, who are responsible for ensuring that [[social services]] are delivered equitably. This implies taking into account historical and current inequalities among groups; fairness is dependent on this social and historical context.&lt;ref name="Gooden"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gooden|first1=Susan T.|title=Race and Social Equity: A Nervous Area of Government|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-31-746145-6|pages=13–18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2dsBgAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22social+equity%22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In public administration==

Attention to social equity in the field of [[public administration]] in the United States arose during the 1960s, amid growing national awareness of [[civil rights]] and [[racial inequality]].{{refn|name=Gooden}}

The National Academy of Public Administration defines the term as “The fair, just and equitable management of all institutions serving the public directly or by contract; the fair, just and equitable distribution of public services and implementation of public policy; and the commitment to promote fairness, justice, and equity in the formation of public policy.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napawash.org/aa_social_equity/index.html National Academy of Public Administration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506083627/http://napawash.org/aa_social_equity/index.html |date=2009-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Social equity.jpg|framed|right]] --&gt;

In 1968, [[H. George Frederickson]] articulated "a theory of social equity" and put it forward as the 'third pillar' of public administration.&lt;ref name="Social Equity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bss.sfsu.edu/naff/PA_752/Frederickson.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612025522/http://bss.sfsu.edu/naff/PA_752/Frederickson.pdf |archivedate=2009-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederickson was concerned that those in public administration were making the mistake of assuming that citizen A is the same as citizen B; ignoring social and economic conditions. His goal: for social equity to take on the same "status as economy and efficiency as values or principles to which public administration should adhere."&lt;ref name="Social Equity" /&gt;

===Gender and sexuality===

Recent{{when|date=July 2014}} administration from former U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] has shed light on the subject of social equity for members of the [[LGBT community]]. From this community, the Obama-Biden administration appointed more than 170 openly LGBT professionals to work full-time within the [[executive branch]]. He has also directed [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] to conduct “the first ever national study to determine the level of discrimination experienced by LGBTs in housing”&lt;ref&gt;Wesley, Joan Marshall, Ercilla Dometz Hendrix, and Jasmine N. Williams. "Moving Forward: Advancing Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual And Transgender Rights Under The Obama Administration Through Progressive Politics." Race, Gender &amp; Class 18.3/4 (2011): 150-168. SocINDEX with Full Text. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Other LGBT advocacy interest groups, such as the [[Human Rights Campaign]], have also worked hard to gain social equity in marriage and to receive all the benefits that come with marriage.

Mitchell, Danielle. "Reading Between The Aisles: Same-Sex Marriage As A Conflicted Symbol Of Social Equity." Topic: The Washington &amp; Jefferson College Review 55.(2007): 89-100. Humanities Source. Web.

===Race===

Within the realm of [[public administration]], [[racial equality]] is an important factor.{{According to whom|date=August 2017}} It deals with the idea of “biological equality” of all human races and “social equality for people of different races”. According to Jeffrey B. Ferguson his article “Freedom, Equality, Race”, the people of the United States believe that racial equality will prevail.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Religion===

In recent years{{when|date=July 2014}} social equity in regards to religion has seen legal improvements to help and protect all people regardless of [[religious affiliation]] or what deity they choose to follow. According to [[42 U.S.C.|42 U.S.C. sect. 2000e(j)]] "Religion is defined as all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to responsibly accommodate to an employee's or prospective employee's religious observance or practice without unique hardship to the conduct of the employer's business."&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Michael D., Sandra J. Hartman, and Dinah Payne. "Religion In The Workplace: Disparate Treatment." Labor Law Journal 49.6 (1998): 1099-1105. Legal Source. Web. 1 Dec. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This law was enacted to protect employees that are employed by bosses of another religion, and allow them to observe their particular [[Religious studies|religious practices]] and celebrations.

==In sustainable development==
In 1996 the United States President's Council on Sustainable Development defined social equity as "equal opportunity, in a safe and healthy environment." Social equity is the least defined and least understood element of the triad that is sustainable development yet is integral in creating sustainability - balancing economic, environmental and social equity.{{According to whom|date=August 2017}}

==In education==
Many colleges and universities consider the term social equity as synonymous with [[social equality]].  Examples include [[Shippensburg University]], [[Edinboro University]], [[Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania]], [[Arizona State College of Public Programs]], [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]] and [[North Carolina State University]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} However, this is an erroneous and misleading classification, because equity and equality are not interchangeable terms. Social equality denotes the idea that every individual receives the same opportunities and resources with no discrimination. Social equity, however, posits that each person should have access to the amount of opportunities and resources that they need specifically. The distinction between these two terms is important because it acknowledges that each person starts off with a different level of privilege in life, and therefore everyone will not have identical needs, due to factors like language, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity and gender.

[[File:Museum of Sozart 7.jpg|thumb|At the Museum of Socialist Art, [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]]]
'''Socialist realism''' is a style of idealized [[realism (arts)|realistic art]] that was developed in the [[Soviet Union]] and was imposed as the official  style in that country between 1932 and 1988, as well as in other socialist countries after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica on-line definition of Socialit Realism&lt;/ref&gt;   Socialist realism is characterized by the glorified depiction of communist values, such as the emancipation of the [[proletariat]], by means of realistic imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Korin, Pavel, "Thoughts on Art", ''Socialist Realism in Literature and Art''. Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1971, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Although related, it should not be confused with [[social realism]], a type of art that realistically depicts subjects of social concern.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, James G. "Social Realism". Art Terms. Museum of Modern Art, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialist realism was the predominant form of [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|approved art in the Soviet Union]] from its development in the early 1920s to its eventual fall from official status beginning in the late 1960s until the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica on-line definition of Socialist Realism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; While other countries have employed a prescribed canon of art, socialist realism in the Soviet Union persisted longer and was more restrictive than elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Valkenier, Elizabeth. ''Russian Realist Art''. Ardis, 1977, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Kulturpalast Dresden Wandbild, Ausschnitt.jpg|thumb|Detail, ''Der Weg der Roten Fahne'', Kulturpalast [[Dresden]], Germany]] 
Socialist realism was developed by many thousands of artists, across a diverse society, over several decades.&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 17"&gt;Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples of realism in Russian art include the work of the [[Peredvizhniki]]s and [[Ilya Yefimovich Repin]]. While these works do not have the same political connotation, they exhibit the techniques exercised by their successors. After the [[Bolsheviks]] took control of Russia on October 25, 1917, there was a marked shift in artistic styles. There had been a short period of artistic exploration in the time between the fall of the [[Tsar]] and the rise of the Bolsheviks.

Shortly after the Bolsheviks took control, [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] was appointed as head of [[Narkompros]], the People's Commissariat for Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 17"/&gt;  This put Lunacharsky in the position of deciding the direction of art in the newly created Soviet state. Although Lunacharsky did not dictate a single aesthetic model for Soviet artists to follow, he developed a system of aesthetics based on the human body that would later help to influence socialist realism. He believed that "the sight of a healthy body, intelligent face or friendly smile was essentially life-enhancing."&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 21"&gt;Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that art had a direct effect on the human organism and under the right circumstances that effect could be positive. By depicting "the perfect person" ([[New Soviet man]]), Lunacharsky believed art could educate citizens on how to be the perfect Soviets.&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 21"/&gt;

=== Debate within Soviet art ===
[[File:First Lenin statue in USSR 1924.jpg|thumb|First Lenin statue built by the workers in [[Noginsk]]]]
There were two main groups debating the fate of Soviet art: futurists and traditionalists. [[Russian Futurism|Russian Futurists]], many of whom had been creating abstract or leftist art before the Bolsheviks, believed communism required a complete rupture from the past and, therefore, so did Soviet art.&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 21"/&gt; Traditionalists believed in the importance of realistic representations of everyday life.  Under [[Lenin]]'s rule and the [[New Economic Policy]], there was a certain amount of private commercial enterprise, allowing both the futurists and the traditionalists to produce their art for individuals with capital.&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 22"&gt;Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; By 1928, the Soviet government had enough strength and authority to end private enterprises, thus ending support for fringe groups such as the futurists. At this point, although the term "socialist realism" was not being used, its defining characteristics became the norm.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The first time the term "socialist realism" was officially used was in 1932. The term was settled upon in meetings that included politicians of the highest level, including Stalin himself.&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 37"&gt;Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maxim Gorky]], a proponent of literary socialist realism, published a famous article titled "Socialist Realism" in 1933 and by 1934 the term's etymology was traced back to Stalin.&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 37"/&gt; During the Congress of 1934, four guidelines were laid out for socialist realism.&lt;ref&gt;Juraga, Dubravka and Booker, Keith M. ''Socialist Cultures East and West''. Praeger, 2002, p.68&lt;/ref&gt;
The work must be:
# Proletarian: art relevant to the workers and understandable to them.
# Typical: scenes of everyday life of the people.
# Realistic: in the representational sense.
# Partisan: supportive of the aims of the State and the Party.

The purpose of socialist realism was to limit popular culture to a specific, highly regulated faction of emotional expression that promoted Soviet ideals.&lt;ref name="Nelson 1988, p. 5"&gt;Nelson, Cary and Lawrence, Grossberg. ''Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture''.  University of Illinois Press, 1988, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The party was of the utmost importance and was always to be favorably featured. The key concepts that developed assured loyalty to the party, "[[partiinost']]" (party-mindedness), "ideinost" (idea- or ideological-content), "klassovost" (class content), "pravdivost" (truthfulness).&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 38"&gt;Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a prevailing sense of optimism, socialist realism's function was to show the ideal Soviet society. Not only was the present gloried, but the future was also supposed to be depicted in an agreeable fashion. Because the present and the future were constantly idealized, socialist realism had a sense of forced optimism. Tragedy and negativity were not permitted, unless they were shown in a different time or place. This sentiment created what would later be dubbed "revolutionary romanticism."&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 38"/&gt;

Revolutionary romanticism elevated the common worker, whether factory or agricultural, by presenting his life, work, and recreation as admirable. Its purpose was to show how much the standard of living had improved thanks to the revolution. Art was used as educational information. By illustrating the party's success, artists were showing their viewers that sovietism was the best political system. Art was also used to show how Soviet citizens should be acting. The ultimate aim was to create what Lenin called "an entirely new type of human being": The ''[[New Soviet Man]]''. Art (especially posters and murals) was a way to instill party values on a massive scale.  Stalin described the socialist realist artists as "engineers of souls."&lt;ref name="Overy, Richard 2004, p. 354"&gt;Overy, Richard. ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2004, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt;

Common images used in socialist realism were flowers, sunlight, the body, youth, flight, industry, and new technology.&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 38"/&gt; These poetic images were used to show the utopianism of communism and the Soviet state. Art became more than an aesthetic pleasure; instead it served a very specific function. Soviet ideals placed functionality and work above all else; therefore, for art to be admired, it must serve a purpose. [[Georgi Plekhanov]], a Marxist theoretician, states that art is useful if it serves society: "There can be no doubt that art acquired a social significance only in so far as it depicts, evokes, or conveys ''actions, emotions and events that are of significance to society''."&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Lawrence H. ''Marxism and Culture''. Kennikat Press, 1980, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist could not, however, portray life just as they saw it because anything that reflected poorly on Communism had to be omitted. People who could not be shown as either wholly good or wholly evil could not be used as characters.&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, Tobia. ''The Russian Artist''. Macmillan Company, 1972, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; This was reflective of the Soviet idea that morality is simple: things are either right or wrong. This view on morality called for idealism over realism.&lt;ref name="Overy, Richard 2004, p. 354"/&gt; Art was filled with health and happiness: paintings showed busy industrial and agricultural scenes; sculptures depicted workers, sentries, and schoolchildren.&lt;ref&gt;Stegelbaum, Lewis and Sokolov, Andrei. ''Stalinism As A Way Of Life''. Yale University Press, 2004, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

Creativity was not an important part of socialist realism: it was actually rejected. The styles used in creating art during this period were those that would produce the most realistic results. Painters would depict happy, muscular peasants and workers in factories and collective farms. During the Stalin period, they produced numerous heroic portraits of the dictator to serve [[Stalin's cult of personality|his cult of personality]]—all in the most realistic fashion possible.&lt;ref&gt;Juraga, Dubravka and Booker, Keith M. ''Socialist Cultures East and West''. Praeger, 2002, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; The most important thing for a socialist realist artist was not artistic integrity but adherence to party doctrine.&lt;ref name="Nelson 1988, p. 5"/&gt; The results were often sentimental kitsch.

==Important groups==

===Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia (AKhRR)===
The Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia ([[AKhRR]]) was established in 1922 and was one of the most influential artist groups in the USSR. The AKhRR worked to truthfully document contemporary life in Russia by utilizing "heroic realism".&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 22"/&gt; The term "heroic realism" was beginning of the socialist realism archetype. AKhRR was sponsored by influential government officials such as [[Leon Trotsky]] and carried favor with the [[Red Army]].&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 22"/&gt;

In 1928, the AKhRR was renamed to Association of Artists of the Revolution (AKhR) in order to include the rest of the Soviet states.  At this point the group had begun participating in state promoted mass forms of art like murals, jointly made paintings, advertisement production and textile design.&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 35"&gt;Ellis, Andrew. ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; The group was disbanded April 23, 1932 by the decree "On the Reorganization of Literary and Artistic Organizations"&lt;ref name="Ellis, Andrew 2012, p. 35"/&gt; serving as the nucleus for the stalinist [[USSR Union of Artists]].

===Society of Easel Painters (OSt)===
While the Society of Easel Painters (OSt) was also focused on the glorification of the revolution they, as per their name, worked individually as easel painters. The most common subjects of the OSt's works fit with the developing socialist realism trope. Their paintings consisted of sport and battle, industry and modern technology.&lt;ref name="Nelson 1988, p. 93"&gt;Nelson, Cary and Lawrence, Grossberg. ''Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture''.  University of Illinois Press, 1988, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

The OSt broke up in 1931 due to some members' demand to transition to collective print and poster work.&lt;ref name="Nelson 1988, p. 93"/&gt; Some prominent members include [[Aleksandr Deyneka]] (till 1928), Yuri Pimanov, Aleksandr Labas, [[Pyotr Vilyams]], all of whom were students or ex-students of Moscow's art school, [[Vkhutemas]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Cary and Lawrence, Grossberg.

==Impact==
[[File:Warszawa-mauzoleum monument.jpg|thumb|250px|A monumental [[obelisk]] surrounded by sculptures of soldiers at the [[Soviet military cemetery in Warsaw]]]]

The impact of socialist realism art can still be seen and felt decades after it was no longer the only state supported style. Even before the end of the [[USSR]] in 1991, the government had been loosening its hold on censorship. After [[Stalin]]'s death in 1953, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] began to condemn the previous regime's practice of excessive restrictions. This freedom allowed artists to begin experimenting with new techniques, but the shift was not immediate. It was not until the ultimate fall of Soviet rule that artists were no longer restricted by the communist party. Many socialist realism tendencies prevailed until the mid-to-late 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name="Evangeli, Aleksandr 2012, p. 218"&gt;Evangeli, Aleksandr. "Echoes of Socialist Realism in Post-Soviet Art", ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, many Russian artists used socialist realism characteristics in an ironic fashion.&lt;ref name="Evangeli, Aleksandr 2012, p. 218"/&gt; This was a complete rupture from what existed only a couple of decades before. Once artists broke from the socialist realism mold there was a significant power shift. Artists began including subjects that could not exist according to Soviet ideals. Now that the power over appearances was taken away from the government, artists achieved a level of authority that had not existed since the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Evangeli, Aleksandr. "Echoes of Socialist Realism in Post-Soviet Art", ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; In the decade immediately after the fall of the USSR, artists represented socialist realism and the Soviet legacy as a traumatic event. By the next decade, there was a unique sense of detachment.&lt;ref&gt;Evangeli, Aleksandr. "Echoes of Socialist Realism in Post-Soviet Art", ''Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920–1970''. Skira Editore S.p.A., 2012, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Western cultures often do not look at socialist realism positively. Democratic countries view the art produced during this period of repression as a lie.&lt;ref&gt;Juraga, Dubravka and Booker, Keith M. ''Socialist Cultures East and West''. Praeger, 2002, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Marxist cultures tend to view communism as a form of totalitarianism that smothers artistic expression and therefore retards the progress of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Lawrence H. ''Marxism and Culture''. Kennikat Press, 1980, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Western cultures often look at socialist realistic works as propaganda rather than art. Artistically it could be seen as grandiose, and as sentimental kitsch.

==Notable works and artists==
[[File:«Во́ин-освободи́тель» — монумент в берлинском Трептов-парке 4 - Kopie.jpg|thumb|right|"Soldier-Liberator" by [[Yevgeny Vuchetich]]. [[Soviet War Memorial (Treptower Park)|Treptower Park Memorial]], [[Berlin]] (1948-1949)]]
[[Maxim Gorky]]'s novel ''[[The Mother (Gorky novel)|Mother]]'' is usually considered{{by whom|date=October 2014}} to have been the first socialist-realist novel.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Gorky was also a major factor in the school's rapid rise, and his pamphlet, ''On Socialist Realism'', essentially lays out the needs of Soviet art. Other important works of literature include [[Fyodor Gladkov]]'s ''[[Cement (novel)|Cement]]'' (1925), [[Nikolai Ostrovsky]]'s ''[[How the Steel Was Tempered]]'' and [[Mikhail Sholokhov]]'s two volume epic, ''[[Quiet Flows the Don]]'' (1934) and ''[[The Don Flows Home to the Sea]]'' (1940). [[Yury Krymov]]'s novel ''Tanker "Derbent"'' (1938) portrays Soviet merchant seafarers being transformed by the [[Stakhanovite movement]].

[[Martin Andersen Nexø]] developed socialist realism in his own way. His creative method featured a combination of publicistic passion, a critical view of capitalist society, and a steadfast striving to bring reality into accord with socialist ideals. The novel ''Pelle, the Conqueror'' is considered to be a classic of socialist realism.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The novel ''Ditte, Daughter of Man'' had a working-class woman as its heroine. He battled against the enemies of socialism in the books ''Two Worlds'', and ''Hands Off!''.

The novels of [[Louis Aragon]], such as ''The Real World'', depict the working class as a rising force of the nation. He published two books of documentary prose, ''The Communist Man''. In the collection of poems ''A Knife in the Heart Again'', Aragon criticizes the penetration of American imperialism into Europe. The novel ''The Holy Week'' depicts the artist's path toward the people against a broad social and historical background.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[Hanns Eisler]] composed many workers' songs, marches, and ballads on current political topics such as ''Song of Solidarity'', ''Song of the United Front'', and ''Song of the Comintern''. He was a founder of a new style of revolutionary song for the masses. He also composed works in larger forms such as ''Requiem for Lenin''. Eisler's most important works include the cantatas ''German Symphony'', ''Serenade of the Age'' and ''Song of Peace''. Eisler combines features of revolutionary songs with varied expression. His symphonic music is known for its complex and subtle orchestration.

Closely associated with the rise of the [[labor movement]] was the development of the [[revolutionary song]], which was performed at demonstrations and meetings. Among the most famous of the revolutionary songs are ''[[The Internationale]]'' and ''[[Whirlwinds of Danger]]''. Notable songs from Russia include ''Boldly, Comrades, in Step'', ''Workers' Marseillaise'', and ''Rage, Tyrants''. Folk and revolutionary songs influenced the Soviet [[mass song]]s. The mass song was a leading genre in Soviet music, especially during the 1930s and the war. The mass song influenced other genres, including the art song, opera, and film music. The most popular mass songs include [[Isaak Dunayevsky|Dunaevsky's]] ''Song of the Homeland'', [[Matvey Blanter|Blanter's]] ''[[Katyusha (song)|Katiusha]]'', Novikov's ''Hymn of Democratic Youth of the World'', and [[Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov|Aleksandrov's]] ''[[Svyaschennaya Voyna|Sacred War]]''.

In the early 1930s, [[Soviet cinema|Soviet filmmakers]] applied socialist realism in their work. Notable films include ''Chapaev'', which shows the role of the people in the history-making process. The theme of revolutionary history was developed in films such as ''[[The Youth of Maxim]]'', by [[Grigori Kozintsev]] and [[Leonid Trauberg]], ''[[Shchors (film)|Shchors]]'' by Dovzhenko, and ''We are from Kronstadt'' by E. Dzigan. The shaping of the new man under socialism was a theme of films such as ''A Start Life'' by N. Ekk, ''Ivan'' by Dovzhenko, ''Valerii Chkalov'' by M. Kalatozov and the film version of ''Tanker "Derbent"'' (1941). Some films depicted the part of peoples of the Soviet Union against foreign invaders: ''Alexander Nevsky'' by Eisenstein, ''Minin and Pozharsky'' by Pudvokin, and ''Bogdan Khmelnitsky'' by Savchenko. Soviet politicians were the subjects in films such as [[Sergei Yutkevich|Yutkevich]]'s trilogy of movies about Lenin.

Socialist realism was also applied to [[Bollywood|Hindi films]] of the 1940s and 1950s.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} These include [[Chetan Anand (producer &amp; director)|Chetan Anand]]'s ''[[Neecha Nagar]]'' (1946), which won the [[Palme d'Or|Grand Prize]] at the [[1946 Cannes Film Festival|1st Cannes Film Festival]], and [[Bimal Roy]]'s ''[[Two Acres of Land]]'' (1953), which won the International Prize at the [[1954 Cannes Film Festival|7th Cannes Film Festival]].

The painter [[Aleksandr Deineka]] provides a notable example for his expressionist and patriotic scenes of the Second World War, collective farms, and sports. [[Yuriy Pimenov]], [[Boris Ioganson]] and [[Geli Korzev]] have also been described as "unappreciated masters of twentieth-century realism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Marek |last=Bartelik, |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0425/is_4_58/ai_59552693 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041123090037/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0425/is_4_58/ai_59552693 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-11-23 |title=Concerning Socialist Realism: Recent Publications on Russian Art (book review) |journal=Art Journal |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known practitioner was [[Fyodor Pavlovich Reshetnikov]].

Socialist realism art found acceptance in the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] nations, inspiring many artists. One such artist was [[Czeslaw Znamierowski]] (23 May 1890 – 9 August 1977), a [[Soviet]] [[Lithuania]]n painter, known for his large panoramic landscapes and love of nature. Znamierowski combined these two passions to create very notable paintings in the Soviet Union, earning the prestigious title of [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Honorable Artist of LSSR]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Alekna, Romas (24 May 1975).

''Thol'', a novel by [[Daniel Selvaraj|D. Selvaraj]] in Tamil is a standing example of Marxist Realism in India. It won a literary award ([[List of Sahitya Akademi Award winners for Tamil|Sahithya Akademi]]) for the year 2012.

In conjunction with the [[Stalinist architecture|Socialist Classical]] style of architecture, socialist realism was the officially approved type of art in the [[Soviet Union]] for more than fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Socialist Realisms: Soviet Painting 1920-1970|last=Ellis|first=Andrew|publisher=Skira Editore S.p.A.|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=20|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All material goods and means of production belonged to the community as a whole; this included means of producing art, which were also seen as powerful [[propaganda]] tools.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In the early years of the Soviet Union, Russian and Soviet artists embraced a wide variety of art forms under the auspices of [[Proletkult]]. Revolutionary politics and radical non-traditional art forms were seen as complementary.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Haftmann, ''Painting in the 20th century'', London 1965, vol.1, p.196.&lt;/ref&gt; In art, [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] flourished. In poetry, the non-traditional and the [[avant-garde]] were often praised.

These styles of art were later rejected by members of the Communist Party who did not appreciate modern styles such as [[Impressionism]] and [[Cubism]]. Socialist realism was, to some extent, a reaction against the adoption of these "decadent" styles. It was thought by Lenin that the non-representative forms of art were not understood by the proletariat and could therefore not be used by the state for propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Haftman, p.196&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Bogdanov]] argued that the radical reformation of society to communist principles meant little if any bourgeois art would prove useful; some of his more radical followers advocated the destruction of libraries and museums.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]], ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime'', p. 288, {{ISBN|978-0-394-50242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin rejected this philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime'', p. 289, {{ISBN|978-0-394-50242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; deplored the rejection of the beautiful because it was old, and explicitly described art as needing to call on its heritage: "[[Proletarian culture]] must be the logical development of the store of knowledge mankind has accumulated under the yoke of capitalist, landowner, and bureaucratic society."&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Sopontsinsky, ''Art in the Soviet Union: Painting, Sculpture, Graphic Arts'', p 6 Aurora Art Publishers, Leningrad, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern art styles appeared to refuse to draw upon this heritage, thus clashing with the long realist tradition in Russia and rendering the art scene complex.&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Sopontsinsky, ''Art in the Soviet Union: Painting, Sculpture, Graphic Arts'', p. 21 Aurora Art Publishers, Leningrad, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Even in Lenin's time, a cultural bureaucracy began to restrain art to fit [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|propaganda purposes]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime'', p283, {{ISBN|978-0-394-50242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Trotsky]]'s arguments that a "[[proletarian literature]]" was un-Marxist because the proletariat would lose its class characteristics in the transition to a classless society, however, did not prevail.&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Stacy, Russian Literary Criticism p191 {{ISBN|0-8156-0108-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Lénine mosaïque.jpg|thumb|left|A mosaic of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] inside the [[Moscow Metro]].]]
Socialist realism became state policy in 1934 when the First Congress of Soviet Writers met and Stalin's representative [[Andrei Zhdanov]] gave a speech strongly endorsing it as "the official style of Soviet culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1934: Writers' Congress|url=http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?page=subject&amp;SubjectID=1934writers&amp;Year=1934|work=Seventeen Moments in Soviet History|accessdate=11 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208100515/http://soviethistory.org/index.php?page=subject&amp;SubjectID=1934writers&amp;Year=1934|archivedate=8 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was enforced ruthlessly in all spheres of artistic endeavour. Form and content were often limited, with erotic, religious, abstract, surrealist, and expressionist art being forbidden. Formal experiments, including internal dialogue, stream of consciousness, nonsense, free-form association, and cut-up were also disallowed. This was either because they were "decadent", unintelligible to the proletariat, or [[counter-revolutionary]].

In response to the 1934 Congress in Russia, the most important American writers of the left gathered in the First American Writers Congress of 26–27 April 1935 in Chicago at meetings that were supported by Stalin. [[Waldo David Frank]] was the first president of the [[League of American Writers]], which was backed by the Communist Party USA. A number of novelists balked at the control, and the League broke up at the invasion of the Soviet Union by German forces.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The first exhibition organized by the Leningrad Union of Artists took place in 1935.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Its participants – Mikhail Avilov, [[Isaak Brodsky]], [[Piotr Buchkin]], Nikolai Dormidontov, [[Rudolf Frentz]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], and [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]] among them – became the founding fathers of the Leningrad school, while their works formed one of its richest layers and the basis of the largest museum collections of Soviet painting of the 1930s-1950s.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

[[File:Isaak Brodsky stalin02.jpg|thumb|225px|A portrait of Stalin by [[Isaak Brodsky]].]]
In 1932, the Leningrad Institute of Proletarian Visual Arts was transformed into the Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture (since 1944 named [[Ilya Repin]]). The fifteen-year period of constant reformation of the country's largest art institute came to an end.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Thus, basic elements of the [[Leningrad School of Painting|Leningrad school]] – namely, a higher art education establishment of a new type and a unified professional union of Leningrad artists, were created by the end of 1932.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 1934 [[Isaak Brodsky]], a disciple of [[Ilya Repin]], was appointed director of the National Academy of Arts and the Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Brodsky invited distinguished painters and pedagogues to teach at the Academy, namely Semion Abugov, Mikhail Bernshtein, [[Ivan Bilibin]], [[Piotr Buchkin]], Efim Cheptsov, [[Rudolf Frentz]], [[Boris Ioganson]], [[Dmitry Kardovsky]], Alexander Karev, Dmitry Kiplik, Yevgeny Lansere, Alexander Lubimov, [[Matvey Manizer]], Vasily Meshkov, Pavel Naumov, [[Alexander Osmerkin]], [[Anna Ostroumova-Lebedeva]], Leonid Ovsyannikov, Nikolai Petrov, Sergei Priselkov, [[Nikolay Punin]], [[Nikolai Radlov]], [[Konstantin Rudakov]], Pavel Shillingovsky, Vasily Shukhaev, Victor Sinaisky, Ivan Stepashkin, [[Konstantin Yuon]], and others.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Art exhibitions of 1935–1940 serve as counterpoint to claims that the artistic life of the period was suppressed by the ideology and artists submitted entirely to what was then called "social order". A great number of [[landscape painting|landscapes]], [[portrait painting|portraits]], and [[genre painting]]s exhibited at the time pursued purely technical purposes and were thus ostensibly free from any ideology. Genre painting was also approached in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V. Ivanov, ''Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School'', {{Full citation needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;!--Place and publisher needed.--&gt;: pp. 29, 32–340. {{ISBN|5-901724-21-6}}, {{ISBN|978-5-901724-21-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-war period between the mid-fifties and sixties, the Leningrad school of painting was approaching its vertex.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} New generations of artists who had graduated from the Academy ([[Repin Institute of Arts]]) in the 1930s–50s were in their prime.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} They were quick to present their art, they strived for experiments, and were eager to appropriate a lot and to learn even more.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Their time and contemporaries, with all its images, ideas, and dispositions found it full expression in portraits by [[Vladimir Gorb]], [[Boris Korneev]], [[Engels Kozlov]], [[Felix Lembersky]], [[Oleg Lomakin]], [[Samuil Nevelshtein]], [[Victor Oreshnikov]], Semion Rotnitsky, [[Lev Russov]], and [[Leonid Steele]]; in landscapes by [[Nikolai Galakhov]], [[Vasily Golubev (painter)|Vasily Golubev]], [[Dmitry Maevsky]], [[Sergei Ivanovich Osipov|Sergei Osipov]], [[Vladimir Ovchinnikov (painter)|Vladimir Ovchinnikov]], [[Alexander Mikhailovich Semionov|Alexander Semionov]], [[Arseny Semionov]], and [[Nikolai Timkov]]; and in genre paintings by Andrey Milnikov, Yevsey Moiseenko, [[Mikhail Natarevich]], [[Yuri Neprintsev]], [[Nikolai Pozdneev]], [[Mikhail Trufanov]], [[Yuri Tulin]], [[Nina Veselova]], and others.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 1957, the first all-Russian Congress of Soviet artists took place in Moscow.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} In 1960, the all-Russian Union of Artists was organized.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Accordingly, these events influenced the art life in Moscow, Leningrad, and the provinces.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The scope of experimentation was broadened; in particular, this concerned the form of painterly and plastic language. Images of youths and students, rapidly changing villages and cities, virgin lands brought under cultivation, grandiose construction plans being realized in Siberia and the Volga region, and great achievements of Soviet science and technology became the chief topics of the new painting. Heroes of the time – young scientists, workers, civil engineers, physicians, etc. – were made the most popular heroes of paintings.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In this period, life provided artists with plenty of thrilling topics, positive figures, and images. Legacy of many great artists and [[art movements]] became available for study and public discussion again. This greatly broadened artists' understanding of the [[realist art|realist method]] and widened its possibilities. It was the repeated renewal of the very conception of [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] that made this style dominate [[Russian art]] throughout its history. Realist tradition gave rise to many trends of [[Contemporary art|contemporary painting]], including painting from nature, "severe style" painting, and decorative art. However, during this period [[impressionism]], [[postimpressionism]], [[cubism]], and [[expressionism]] also had their fervent adherents and interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradschool.com/outline.htm Sergei V.

The restrictions were relaxed somewhat after Stalin's death in 1953, but the state still kept a tight rein on personal artistic expression.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} This caused many artists to choose to go into exile, for example the [[Odessa Group]] from the city of that name.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Independent-minded artists that remained continued to feel the hostility of the state.

In 1974, for instance, a show of unofficial art in a field near Moscow was broken up and the artwork destroyed with a water cannon and bulldozers (see [[Bulldozer Exhibition]]). [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]] facilitated an explosion of interest in alternative art styles in the late 1980s, but socialist realism remained in limited force as the official state art style until as late as 1991. It was not until after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] that artists were finally freed from state censorship.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

After the Russian Revolution, socialist realism became an international literary movement. Socialist trends in literature were established in the 1920s in Germany, France, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. Writers who helped develop socialist realism in the West included [[Louis Aragon]], [[Johannes Becher]], and [[Pablo Neruda]].&lt;ref name="cultinfo.ru"&gt;[https://archive.is/20050508193618/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/104/892.htm D.F. Markov and L.I. Timofeev, "Socialist Realism"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of socialist realism in other [[People's Republic]]s, was legally enforced from 1949 to 1956. It involved all domains of visual and literary arts, though its most spectacular achievements were made in the field of architecture, considered a key weapon in the creation of a new [[social order]], intended to help spread the communist doctrine by influencing citizens' consciousness as well as their outlook on life. During this massive undertaking, a crucial role fell to architects perceived not as merely engineers creating streets and edifices, but rather as "[[engineers of the human soul]]" who, in addition to extending simple aesthetics into urban design, were to express grandiose ideas and arouse feelings of stability, persistence and political power.

Today, arguably the only countries still focused on these aesthetic principles are [[North Korea]], [[Laos]], and to some extent [[Vietnam]]. The People's Republic of China occasionally reverts to socialist realism for specific purposes, such as idealised propaganda posters to promote the [[Chinese space program]]. Socialist realism had little mainstream impact in the non-Communist world, where it was widely seen as a totalitarian means of imposing state control on artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sinoss.net/qikan/uploadfile/2011/0708/20110708020439197.pdf Lin Jung-hua. Post-Soviet Aestheticians Rethinking Russianization and Chinization of Marxism//Russian Language and Literature Studies. Serial № 33. Beijing, Capital Normal University, 2011, №3. Р.46-53.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was an important exception among the communist countries, because after the [[Tito-Stalin split]] in 1948, it abandoned socialist realism along with other elements previously imported from the Soviet system and allowed greater artistic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] – [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+yu0035) Yugoslavia: ''Introduction of Socialist Self-Management'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miroslav Krleža]], one of the leading Yugoslav intellectuals, gave a speech at the Third Congress of the Writers Alliance of Yugoslavia held in [[Ljubljana]] in 1952, which is considered a turning point in the Yugoslav denouncement of [[dogmatic]] socialist realism.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[Image:Cardinal Thomas Wolsey.jpg|thumb|right|Cardinal Wolsey, the principal designer of the Treaty of London (1518)]]
The '''Treaty of London''' in  1518 was a [[non-aggression pact]] between the major European nations. The signatories were [[Duke_of_Burgundy#House_of_Habsburg_.281482.E2.80.931700.29|Burgundy]], [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Kingdom of England|England]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Habsburg Netherlands|Netherlands]], the [[Papal States]] and [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], all of whom agreed not to attack one another and to come to the aid of any that were under attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tudorhistory.org/calendar/treaties.html Tudor History. Treaty of London]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2017}}

The treaty was designed by [[Cardinal Wolsey]] and so came to be signed by the ambassadors of the nations concerned in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.wisc.edu/sommerville/361/361-06.htm Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey, History at University of Wisconsin] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915234646/http://history.wisc.edu/sommerville/361/361-06.htm |date=2007-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a response to the rising power of the [[Ottoman Empire]] which was encroaching into the [[Balkans]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Wolsey was very keen on making lasting peace and persuaded Henry to avoid war and take a more diplomatic route in financial affairs. 

==Background==
{{unreferenced-section|date=April 2017}}
During the 15th century, peace was established for 50 years in the [[Italian Peninsula]], which was divided into [[List of historic states of Italy#Late_Middle_Ages|many small city-states]]. Only a small war between [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and the [[Papal States|Papacy]] for the control of [[Ferrara]] caused a temporary lapse in the peace. This peaceful period came to an end with the [[First Italian War|French invasion of 1494]]. A succession of small wars followed and in 1518 the political possibilities of a peace treaty seemed a realisation.

==Terms==
[[Image:Henry-VIII-kingofengland 1491-1547.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The treaty reflected considerable glory upon the reign of King Henry VIII]]
All European countries except for [[Ottoman Empire|Islamic Turkey]] were invited to [[London]] ([[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Russia]] was not considered to be a part of Europe, but of Asia at that time). The treaty hoped to bind the 20 leading states of [[Europe]] into peace with one another, and thus end [[warfare]] between the states of Europe. In October 1518 it was initiated between representatives from England and France. It was then ratified by other [[Europe]]an nations and the [[Pope]]. The agreement established a defensive league based upon the following:

The terms committed states with an active [[foreign policy]] to not only commit to a stance of non-aggression, but also to promise to make war upon any state which broke the terms of the treaty. At the time, it was thought a triumph for [[Thomas Wolsey]] and allowed [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] to greatly increase his standing in European political circles, to the extent that England became seen as a third major power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Europe and England in the sixteenth century|first1=T.A.|last1=Morris|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=1998|location=London|isbn=9780415150415|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1uOEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=treaty-of-London+%22Europe+and+England+in+the+sixteenth+century%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n7d7lFtvhS&amp;sig=-Edi_88qxxmu39X_PAIDpUfxW5Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo09ae-fjZAhWkq1kKHdsPDl0Q6AEIOTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=treaty-of-London%20%22Europe%20and%20England%20in%20the%20sixteenth%20century%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{incomplete citation|date=April 2017}}

==Legacy ==
{{unreferenced-section|date=April 2017}}
The peace the treaty brought lasted for a very short time. Wars broke out in a few years including [[Kalmar_Union#Conflict|wars between Denmark and Sweden]], and between an alliance of England and Spain against France. The peace movement however continued for next centuries and became part of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] movement in the 18th century.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Human Rights Watch report, 18 (2)&lt;/ref&gt;  have also highlighted the violence and abuse towards children accused of [[witchcraft]] in Africa. Accusations of witchcraft in Africa are a very serious matter as the [[witch]] is culturally understood to be the epitome of evil and the cause of all misfortune, disease and death. Consequently, the witch is the most hated person in African society and subjected to punishment, torture and even death.&lt;ref&gt;Mbiti, John 1975. Introduction to African Religion (2nd rev. ed.).

The victims of witchcraft accusations in African societies have usually been the elderly, the disabled, [[albinism|albinos]] and anyone who was considered different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11535155 |title=BBC News - Malawi plea to free convicted 'witches' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2010-10-13 |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consultancyafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=783:hunting-the-vulnerable-witchcraft-and-the-law-in-malawi&amp;catid=91:rights-in-focus&amp;Itemid=296 |title=Hunting the vulnerable: Witchcraft and the law in Malawi |publisher=Consultancyafrica.com |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goliat, Aubrey J, Frank B. Phiri and Erwin van der Meer 2010. Preliminary findings on the problem of Child Witchcraft Accusations in Malawi. Blantyre, Malawi: Africa Outreach.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years due to the impact of rapid urbanisation, economic decline, as well as the [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|HIV/AIDS pandemic]], children have become more and more the victims of witchcraft accusations, especially orphans. Other factors of the rise of accusations include the rise of charismatic preachers such as [[Helen Ukpabio]], generational social conflicts and the deterioration of education systems. Religiously-inspired films also legitimize beliefs about children witches.&lt;ref name=Riedel/&gt;

Child victims of witchcraft accusations are more vulnerable than adult victims as they cannot defend themselves as they are confronted with physical and psychological abuse from their family and community.&lt;ref name="Channel 4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/episode-guide/series-8/episode-1/ |title=Dispatches - Saving Africa's Witch Children |publisher=Channel 4 |date= |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The sheer scale and intenseness of the recent witch-hunts targeting children classifies as unprecedented in written history.|author=Ethnologist Felix Riedel&lt;ref name=Riedel/&gt;}}

Children accused of witchcraft may be subjected to violent [[exorcism]] rituals by African [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]]-[[Charismatic Movement|Charismatic]] pastors who mix Christianity with African witchcraft beliefs. Such exorcism may include incarceration, starvation, being made to drink hazardous substances or even being set on fire with gasoline.&lt;ref name="Channel 4"/&gt;  In other cases accused children are expelled and end up living on the streets, are trafficked and in some instances they are killed.&lt;ref name="Yuba"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Riedel/&gt;

=== West Africa ===
In [[The Gambia]], about 1,000 people accused of being witches were locked in government detention centers in March 2009. They were forced to drink an unknown [[hallucinogenic]] potion, according to [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref name="Abuse"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/05/18/nigeria.child.witchcraft/index.html|title=Abuse of child 'witches' on rise, aid group says|first=Faith |last=Karimi|publisher=CNN|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were then forced to confess to witchcraft, some were also severely beaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/19/gambia-witchcraft-hallucinogenics|title=Gambian state kidnaps 1,000 villagers in mass purge of 'witchcraft'|last=Rice|first=Xan|date=2009-03-19|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nigeria]], [[Helen Ukpabio]] and other [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] pastors have incorporated African witchcraft beliefs into their brand of Christianity, resulting in a campaign of violence against young Nigerians.

In [[Sierra Leone]] and neighbouring countries, the young survivors of the [[List of Ebola outbreaks|ebola epidemic]] are often accused of withcraft, losing parents to the disease and community support to superstition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/ebola-children-survivors-accused-of-witchcraft-black-magic-in-west-africa-127850/|title=Ebola Children Survivors Accused of Witchcraft, Black Magic in West Africa|last=Zaimov|first=Stoyan|date=October 10, 2014|work=The Christian Post|access-date=October 14, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a disputable empiric construction, sick infants tend to have better survival-rates due to witchhunts:

{{quote|[T]he effect of the witch cleansing probably lasts for years in the sense that mothers are predisposed to tend their babies with more hopefulness and real concern. Therefore many babies who, before the arrival of the witchfinder, might have been saved if the mothers had had the heart and will to stop at nothing to tend their babies, will now survive precisely because they will receive the best attention, as the mothers now believe that the remaining children are free of witchcraft. So there is a reduction in the infant mortality rate in the years immediately following the witchcleansing movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gittins|first1=Anthony J.|title=Mende Religion.

=== Congo ===
In the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], it is estimated that there are 25,000 homeless children living on the streets of the capital city. Of these, 60% were expelled from their homes because of allegations of witchcraft. Accusations of witchcraft is the only justifiable reason for the refusal to house a family member, no matter how distant the relation.&lt;ref&gt;CONGO RELATIVES ACCUSING KIDS OF WITCHCRAFT :[ALL Edition].

=== Ethiopia ===
{{Main|Mingi}}

In Ethiopia, [[Mingi]] is the traditional belief among the [[Omotic languages|Omotic]]-speaking [[Karo language|Karo-speaking]] and [[Hamar people]] in southern [[Ethiopia]] that adults and children with physical abnormalities are ritually impure.&lt;ref name="Petros"&gt;{{cite book|last=Petros|first=Gezahegn|title=The Karo of the lower Omo Valley: subsistence, social organisation and relations with neighbouring groups|year=2000|publisher=Dept. of Sociology, Anthropology and Social Administration, Addis Ababa University|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bE0wAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strecker, Ivo.

==Possible solutions==
Interventions until now have been limited and localised such as the safe houses run by [[Safe Child Africa]] and their partners in Akwa Ibom State in Nigeria by Bishop Emílio Sumbelelo of St. Joseph's Catholic Church, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Uíje]], [[Angola]], and by Africa Outreach in [[Malawi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steppingstonesnigeria.org/current-projects.html |title=Current Projects &amp;#124; What We Do |publisher=Steppingstonesnigeria.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lafraniere |first=Sharon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/15/world/africa/15witches.html |title=African Crucible - Cast as Witches, Then Cast Out |location=Angola;Congo (Formerly Zaire);Congo Republic |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2007-11-15 |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.across-outreach.org/What_we_do.html |title=What we do |publisher=Across-outreach.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-outreach.com |title=Welcome to Africa Outreach Christian Mission |publisher=Africa-outreach.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the distribution of documentaries on the topic, such as "[[Saving Africa's Witch Children|Saving Africa's Witch-Children]]" (2008) and "Dispatches: Return to Africa's Witch Children",&lt;ref name=Riedel/&gt; global awareness of the problem of child witchcraft accusations in Africa is growing as evidenced by the above-mentioned UNICEF and UNHCR reports. It is likely that increased global awareness of the problem of child witchcraft accusations in Africa will eventually lead to more initiatives to assist its victims. Nevertheless, it is equally important to address the underlying socio-economic, political and environmental factors that contribute to this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Der Meer|first1=Erwin|title=Child witchcraft accusations in Southern Malawi|journal=The Australasian Review of African Studies|date=June 2013|volume=34|issue=1|pages=129–144|url=http://afsaap.org.au/assets/ARAs_vol34no1_van_der_meer_129-144.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime the general population in countries where child witchcraft beliefs are prevalent need to be made aware that the torture and killing of children is unacceptable. This can be done by means of grass-roots awareness and prevention campaigns, conferences and theological education with the support of religious leaders, who need to be engaged and become part of the solution and not part of the problem. The judiciary, human rights organizations, civil society, and local and national governments can also aid this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Der Meer|first1=Erwin|title=Child witchcraft accusations in Southern Malawi|journal=The Australasian Review of African Studies|date=June 2013|volume=34|issue=1|pages=138ff|url=http://afsaap.org.au/assets/ARAs_vol34no1_van_der_meer_129-144.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread to the UK==
Research by [[Leo Ruickbie|Dr Leo Ruickbie]] has shown that the problem of child witchcraft accusations is spreading from Africa to areas with African immigrant populations. In some cases this has led to ritualised abuse and even murder, particularly in the UK with such high-profile cases as that of [[Kristy Bamu]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Ruickbie, Leo, 'Child Witches: From Imaginary Cannibalism to Ritual Abuse', Paranthropology, 3.3 (July 2012), pp. 13-21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pansussexscb.proceduresonline.com/pdfs/g_abu_link_spirit.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825075936/http://pansussexscb.proceduresonline.com/pdfs/g_abu_link_spirit.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-08-25 |format=PDF |title=ABUSE LINKED TO A BELIEF IN SPIRIT POSESSION &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; /WITCHCRAFT – PRACTICE GUIDANCE FOR SOCIAL WORKERS |date=August 2012 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4641">The '''World Leadership Awards''' have been prepared by the [[World Leadership Forum]] of England, UK (reportedly dissolved as of 2012),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.duedil.com/company/04085053/the-world-leadership-forum-limited "The World Leadership Forum Limited" page], in the business-information database website Duedil.com&lt;/ref&gt; and have been presented to city leaders who have shown exceptional imagination, foresight or resilience in a number of key fields - especially cities that have reversed trends, shaken off traditional images, and acted as an example and inspiration to others.&lt;ref name="mediaclub_SAfrica_2007_02_06"&gt;[http://www.mediaclubsouthafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;catid=45:economy_news&amp;id=260:uctmba06022008 "Nelson Mandela Bay is the best (African City of the Year, 2007)"] by Janine Erasmus, http://www.mediaclubsouthafrica.com/about-us MediaClubSouthAfrica.com news service, Feb.6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Awards were instituted in 2005 and awarded in 2006 and 2007. Press releases from some winners have indicated that in 2006, around 400 cities worldwide, were invited to compete in 15 categories of urban quality and improvement.&lt;ref name="mediaclub_SAfrica_2007_02_06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tinubu_africa_2006_03_15"&gt;[http://business.highbeam.com/3548/article-1G1-143282836/benefits-world-leadership-awards-tinubu "Benefits of World Leadership Awards,"] by Tinubu, Lagos, Nigeria, March 14, 2006, ''Africa News Service'', March 15, 2006 as reprinted on HighBeam.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the Awards (or others of the same name)) have since been awarded in 2012, after the apparent 2009 collapse of the sponsoring World Leadership Forum organization.
