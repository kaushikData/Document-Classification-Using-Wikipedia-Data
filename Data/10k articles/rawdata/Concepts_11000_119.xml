      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8598">An '''Administrative Monetary Penalty''' is a [[civil penalty]] imposed by a regulator for a contravention of an Act, regulation or by-law.{{sfn|LCO|2011|p=50}} It is issued upon discovery of an unlawful event, and is due and payable subject only to any rights of review that may be available under the AMP's implementing scheme.{{sfn|LCO|2011|p=50}} It is regulatory in nature, rather than criminal, and is intended to secure compliance with a regulatory scheme,{{sfn|LCO|2011|p=50}} and it can be employed with the use of other administrative sanctions, such as [[demerit point]]s and [[administrative license suspension|license suspension]]s.{{sfn|AG Ontario|2015|p=2}}

==Nature==
AMPs differ from ordinary fines, such as those for [[parking ticket]]s, in that, under the relevant legislation:{{sfn|AG BC|2008|p=5}}

#the AMP applies to a narrower segment of the general population (for example, a regulated industry);   
#imposing an AMP involves a number of steps, for instance, the person may first be given a warning and/or an opportunity to address the statutory decision-maker’s concerns (that is, to comply with the scheme); 
#the decision to impose an AMP is made by a senior official such as a Director or a person designated by that Director; 
#the criteria to guide the determination whether to impose and how to set the amount of an AMP is set out; 
#within those criteria, the person empowered to levy the penalty may be given significant discretion to decide whether to impose an AMP and to determine the appropriate amount of the AMP; and   
#the reconsideration or review/appeal of an AMP by the statutory decision-maker and/or an independent, specialized tribunalis allowed.

==AMPs by jurisdiction==
===United Kingdom===
Legislation enabling general schemes of fixed and variable monetary penalties{{em dash}}in addition to other sanctions{{em dash}}has been introduced through Part 3 of the ''[[Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008]]''.{{sfn|Prabhu|2011|pp=130{{en dash}}132}}

Under the ''Road Traffic Act 1991''{{em dash}}and subsequently expanded under part 6 of the ''[[Traffic Management Act 2004]]''{{em dash}}AMPs known as "penalty charge notices" have replaced [[fixed penalty notice]]s where local authorities have adopted schemes of [[decriminalised parking enforcement]]. In some areas such as [[London, England|London]], the challenge process for PCNs can be completed online, via the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment and Traffic Adjudicators|url=http://www.londontribunals.gov.uk/eat|publisher=[[London Tribunals]]|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In ''[[Guindon v Canada]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Guindon v Canada|link=Guindon v Canada|year=2015|court=scc|num=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that AMPs are generally considered to be administrative in nature and thus not subject to the legal protections provided under [[Section 11 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|s.11]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. They are held not to arise from criminal proceedings, as "the purpose ... is to promote honesty and deter gross negligence"&lt;ref&gt;''Guindon'', par. 62&lt;/ref&gt; and "it is rational that the state would only wish to impose a penalty on those who engage in misconduct knowingly, recklessly, or with a particular intention."&lt;ref&gt;''Guindon'', par. 72&lt;/ref&gt; They also do not attract a true penal consequence, as "high administrative monetary penalties [are] required to encourage compliance with the administrative regime. The relevant question is not the amount of the penalty in absolute terms, it is whether the amount serves regulatory rather than penal purposes."&lt;ref&gt;''Guindon'', par. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

However, normal standards of [[judicial review]] continue to apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.administrativelawmatters.com/blog/2015/08/03/its-just-a-fine-guindon-v-canada-2015-scc-41/|title= It’s Just (a) Fine: ''Guindon v. Canada'', 2015 SCC 41|last1= Daly|first1= Paul |date= August 3, 2015|website= administrativelawmatters.com|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Guindon'', the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] provided more guidance in its judgment as to when an administrative penalty would be considered disproportionate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Canada v Guindon|year=2013|court=fca|num=153|pinpoint=par. 44|date=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] has given a reasoned evaluation for a monetary penalty that arose from a securities proceeding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Rowan v. Ontario Securities Commission|link=|year=2012|court=onca|num=208|pinpoint=par. 52, 55|parallelcite=110 OR (3d) 492|date=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Administrative Tribunal of Quebec]] has recognized that a person can bring forward the "reasonable, prudent and diligent person" defence that exists in civil law against the imposition of AMPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianenergylawblog.com/2015/08/04/supreme_court_of_canada_upholds_the_constitutional_validity_of_administrative_monetary_penalties/ |title=Supreme Court of Canada upholds the constitutional validity of administrative monetary penalties |last1=Gagné |first1=Michel |last2=Frémont |first2=Catherine |date=August 4, 2015 |website=canadianenergylawblog.com |publisher=[[McCarthy Tétrault]] |access-date= |quote= }}, citing ''Excavation René St-Pierre Inc. c Québec'', [http://www.canlii.org/fr/qc/qctaq/doc/2015/2015canlii7296/2015canlii7296.html 2015 QCTAQ 02386]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Canada]] has introduced various AMP schemes on a sector-by-sector basis,&lt;ref&gt;including the ''[[Aeronautics Act]]'', the ''Customs Act'', the ''Income Tax Act'', the ''Employment Insurance Act'' and the 
''Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Act&lt;/ref&gt; although some agencies prefer to pursue ticketing schemes for specified [[summary offence]]s, notably under the ''[[Contraventions Act]]''.{{sfn|Prabhu|2011|pp=139{{en dash}}140}}

[[Ontario]] is considering creating a new AMP system to address minor offences that are currently prosecuted under its ''Provincial Offences Act''. The [[Attorney General of Ontario]] has requested input into the new system being proposed.{{sfn|AG Ontario|2015|p=1}} In response, some have suggested that, with proper planning, an online system would be more cost-efficient and promote easier access to justice for people in rural areas and for those with language barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chatten|first1=David|title=Online AMP System - A Strong Move for Ontario|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/administrative-monetary-penalties-great-move-ontario-david-chatten|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some people fear that a new system will be cumbersome and will not allow access to justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Driving Down Business|url=http://paralegalscope.com/driving-down-business-province-rolls-out-diy-online-poa-challenges/|website=Paralegal Scope Magazine|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference in fatality rates by road classification reflects the difference in road design and use. The Interstate System is designed for high speeds, efficient movement of people and goods over long distances, with no at-grade intersections. Drivers have a clear view of the road, traffic, and signs. Collectors and local roads, however, are designed to provide more land access and lesser mobility. They may have sharp curves, steeper grades, and sight restrictions.

As a corollary to the rule that drivers generally must not pose an "immediate hazard" upon where or when they cannot assure such distance ahead is clear, it follows that others may presume that no vehicle is posing an "immediate hazard" from beyond where they can see with proper lookout. Where there are cross roads or side roads with view obstructions, the assured clear distance terminates at the closest path of potential users of the roadway until there is such a view which assures the intersection will remain clear. In such situations, approach speed must be reduced in preparation for entering or crossing a road or intersection or the unmarked pedestrian crosswalks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/pubs/vctop/vc/d1/275 |title=California Vehicle Code §275(a) |publisher=The State of California |quote="Crosswalk" is...That portion of a roadway included within the prolongation or connection of the boundary lines of sidewalks at intersections where the intersecting roadways meet at approximately right angles, except the prolongation of such lines from an alley across a street.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/pubs/vctop/vc/d11/c5/21950 |title=California Vehicle Code §21950(a)&amp;(c) |publisher=The State of California

When approaching an un-signalized intersection controlled by a [[stop sign]], the assured clear distance ahead is:

:&lt;math&gt;
ACDA_{si} = V \left( \sqrt{\frac{2d_i}{a_i}} + t_{pc} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Normal acceleration "{{math|a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}" for a passenger vehicle from a stop up to 20&amp;nbsp;mph is about 0.15g, with more than 0.3g being difficult to exceed.&lt;ref name="J. Stannard Baker"/&gt; The distance "{{math|d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}" is the sum of the measured [[Stop and yield lines|limit line]] setback distance—which is typically regulated by a [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]], at often between 4 and 30 feet in the United States&lt;ref name="23 CFR 603"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=a2583ef3fa3a41e5b157549f8dd705ab&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt23.1.655&amp;rgn=div5#se23.1.655_1603 |title=Title 23, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 655.603 |publisher=US Government Publishing Office |quote=The MUTCD approved by the Federal Highway Administrator is the national standard for all traffic control devices installed on any street, highway, or bicycle trail open to public travel in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 109(d) and 402(a)...Where State or other Federal agency MUTCDs or supplements are required, they shall be in substantial conformance with the National MUTCD.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CAMUTCD"&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/traffops/engineering/mutcd/ca_mutcd2014.htm |title=California MUTCD 2014 |publisher=California Department of Transportation |chapter=3B.16.10 |page=681 |quote=Chapter 3B.16.10: If used, stop and yield lines should be placed a minimum of 4 feet in advance of the nearest crosswalk line at controlled intersections...In the absence of a marked crosswalk, the stop line or yield line should be placed at the desired stopping or yielding point, but should not be placed more than 30 feet or less than 4 feet from the nearest edge of the intersecting traveled way.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CAHDM"&gt;{{cite book |title=California Highway Design Manual |publisher=California Department of Transportation |chapter=405.1 |pages=400–14 |year=2012 |chapter-url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/oppd/hdm/hdmtoc.htm |quote=Chapter 405.1: Set back for the driver of the vehicle on the crossroad shall be a minimum of 10 feet plus the shoulder width of the major road but not less than 15 feet.}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and the [[crosswalk]], [[Parallel parking|parking lane]], and [[road shoulder]] width.

====ACDA as a function of horizontal sight distance====
Horizontal clearance is measured from the edge of the traveled way to the bottom of the nearest object, tree trunk or shrub foliage mass face, plant setback, or mature growth.&lt;ref name="AASHTO"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets |edition=6th |year=2011 |publisher=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |isbn=978-1560515081 |url=https://bookstore.transportation.org/collection_detail.aspx?ID=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDOT"/&gt; Horizontal sight distance is not to be confused with the clear recovery zone which provides hazardous vegetation set-back to allow errant vehicles to regain control, and is exclusive to a mowed and limbed-up forest which can allow adequate sight distance, but unsafe recovery.&lt;ref name="CDOT"/&gt; The height and lateral distance of plants restrict the horizontal sight distance, at times obscuring wildlife which may be spooked by an approaching vehicle and run across the road to escape with their [[herd]].&lt;ref name="deer"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Targeting mitigation efforts: The role of speed limit and road edge clearance for deer–vehicle collisions |doi = 10.1002/jwmg.712 |journal =The Journal of Wildlife Management |date=2014 |volume=78 |issue = 4 |pages=679–688 |quote=speed limit reduction and road edge clearance are both powerful mitigation tools to reduce the number of [[Deer–vehicle collisions]].|last1 = Meisingset |first1 = Erling L |last2 = Loe |first2 = Leif E |last3 = Brekkum |first3 = Øystein |last4 = Mysterud |first4 = Atle }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDOT"/&gt; This principle also applies to approaching vehicles and pedestrians at uncontrolled intersections and to a lesser degree by un-signalized intersections controlled by a [[yield sign]]. Horizontal sight distance "{{math|d&lt;sub&gt;hsd&lt;/sub&gt;}}" affects the ACDA because the time {{math|t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;{{=}}{{sfrac|d&lt;sub&gt;hsd&lt;/sub&gt;|V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} it takes for an intercepting object, animal, pedestrian, or vehicle with speed "{{math|V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}" to transverse this distance after emerging from the proximate edge of lateral visibility affords a vehicle with speed "{{math|V}}" a clear distance of "{{math|V*t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}." Thus, the assured clear intercept distance "{{math|ACDA&lt;sub&gt;si&lt;/sub&gt;}}" is:

:&lt;math&gt;
ACDA_{si}=\frac{V d_{hsd}}{V_i}
&lt;/math&gt;

The faster one drives, the farther down-road an interceptor must be in order to be able to transverse the horizontal sight distance in time to collide, however this says nothing of whether the vehicle can stop by the end of this type of assured clear distance. Equating this distance to the total stopping distance and solving for speed yields one's maximum [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead#Relation to the basic speed rule|safe speed]] as purely dictated by the horizontal sight distance.

===Dynamic "following" distance===
The ACDA may also be dynamic as to the moving distance past which a motorist can be assured to be able to stay clear of a foreseeable dynamic hazard—such as to maintain a distance as to be able to safely swerve around a bicyclist should he succumb to a fall—without requiring a full stop beforehand, if doing so could be exercised with [[due care]] towards surrounding traffic. Quantitatively this distance is a function of the appropriate time gap and the operating speed: {{math|d&lt;sub&gt;ACDA&lt;/sub&gt;{{=}}t&lt;sub&gt;gap&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;sdot;&lt;var&gt;v&lt;/var&gt;}}. The assured clear distance ahead rule, rather than being subject to exceptions, is not really intended to apply beyond situations in which a vigilant ordinarily prudent person could or should anticipate.&lt;ref name="75 ALR.3d 327"/&gt; A common way to violate the dynamic ACDA is by [[tailgating]].

===Measurement===
The most accurate way to determine the ACDA is to directly measure it. Whereas this is impractical, [[Geometric design of roads#Profile|sight distance formulas]] can be used with less direct measurements as rough baseline estimates. The [[empirical]] assured clear distance ahead calculated with [[computer vision]], [[range finding]], [[traction control]], and [[Geographic information system|GIS]], such as by properly [[Computer programming|programming]] computer hardware used in [[autonomous cars]], can be recorded to later produce or color baseline ACDA and safe speed maps for accident investigation, traffic engineering, and show disparities between safe speed and 85th percentile "operating" speed.&lt;ref name="computer vision"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/magazine/the-dream-life-of-driverless-cars.html |title=Sightlines/The Dream Life of Driverless Cars |author=Geoff Manaugh |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |page=MM68 |date=November 15, 2015 |quote=One of the most significant uses of 3-D scanning in the years to come will not be by humans at all but by autonomous vehicles.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-driving cars&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/technology/personaltech/google-says-its-not-the-driverless-cars-fault-its-other-drivers.html |title=Google’s Driverless Cars Run Into Problem: Cars With Drivers |author1=Matt Richtel |author2=Conor Dougherty |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |page=A1 |date=September 2, 2015 |quote=Google’s fleet of autonomous test cars is programmed to follow the letter of the law. But it can be tough to get around if you are a stickler for the rules. ... One Google car, in a test in 2009, couldn’t get through a four-way stop because its sensors kept waiting for other (human) drivers to stop completely and let it go.

The Google car immediately jerked to the right in case it had to avoid a collision. }}&lt;/ref&gt; may have a higher safe speed than human driven vehicles for a given ACDA where computer perception-reaction times are nearly instantaneous.

===Discretion===
The Assured Clear Distance Ahead can be subjective to the baseline estimate of a [[ordinary care|reasonable person]] or be predetermined by law. For example, whether one should have reasonably foreseen that a road was not assuredly clear past 75–100 meters because of tractors or livestock which commonly emerge from encroaching blinding vegetation is on occasion dependent on societal experience within the locale. In certain urban environments, a straight, traffic-less, through-street may not necessarily be assuredly clear past the entrance of the nearest [[Geometric design of roads#Effects of insufficient sight distance|visually obstructed intersection]] as law.&lt;ref name="189 Cal. 335"/&gt;&lt;ref name="22 Cal. App. 2d 636"/&gt;&lt;ref name="139 Cal. App. 2d 65"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Factors"/&gt; Within the assured clear distance ahead, there is certainty that travel will be free from obstruction which is exclusive of a failure to appreciate a hazard. Collisions generally only occur within one's assured clear distance ahead which are "unavoidable" to them such that they have zero comparative negligence including [[Act of God|legal acts of god]] and abrupt unforeseeably wanton negligence by another party. Hazards which penetrate one's proximate edge of clear visibility and compromise their ACDA generally require evasive action.

Drivers need not and are not required to precisely determine the maximum safe speed from real-time mathematical calculations of sight distances and stopping distances for their particular vehicle.&lt;ref name="83 Cal.

====Seconds of distance to stop rule====

Drivers and law enforcement alike can apply elementary level arithmetic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corestandards.org/assets/CCSSI_Math%20Standards.pdf |title=Common Core State Standard for Mathematics |publisher=Common Core State Standards Initiative |page=27 |quote=See 4th grade math level}}&lt;/ref&gt; towards a [[rule of thumb]] to estimate minimal stopping distance in terms of how many seconds of travel ahead at their current speed. For speed "{{math|&lt;var&gt;v&lt;/var&gt;}}" in miles per hour, this rule of thumb is as follows:

:::&lt;math&gt;\color{Sepia}{t\approx\frac{v}{20} + 1 \quad \text{(Seconds of distance to stop rule)}}&lt;/math&gt;

If this distance is greater than the ACDA, they need to slow down. While most experienced drivers develop a broad [[intuition]] required by everyday braking,&lt;ref name="Gibson&amp;Crooks"/&gt; this rule of thumb can still benefit some to recalibrate expectations for rare hard braking, particularly from high speeds. Additional simple corrections can be made to compensate for the environment and driving ability. Read more about the [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead#Seconds of distance to stop rule 2|Seconds of Distance to Stop Rule]].

==ACDA Rule specific case generalized to the Basic Speed Law==
The ACDA distances are a principal component to be evaluated in the determination of the maximum safe speed (V&lt;sub&gt;BSL&lt;/sub&gt;) under the [[Speed limit#Reasonable speed|basic speed law]], without which the maximum safe speed cannot be determined. As mathematical statements are more precise than verbal statements alone,&lt;ref name="Hand rule"/&gt; the relation of the ACDA as a [[subset]] of the basic speed rule for land based vehicles may be objectively quantified as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
V_{BSL}= \begin{cases}
 \sqrt{(\mu +e)^2 g^2 t_{prt}^2+ 2 (\mu + e) g d_{ACDA_s} } - (\mu+e) g t_{prt}, &amp; \text{if } V_{ACDA_s} \le V_{ACDA_{si1}} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_{si2}} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_d} \text{ or } V_{cs} \text{ or } V_{cl}\\
\\
2 g (\mu + e) (\frac{d_{hsd}}{v_i}-t_{prt}), &amp; \text{if } V_{ACDA_{si1}} &lt; V_{ACDA_s} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_{si2}} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_d} \text{ or } V_{cs} \text{ or } V_{cl}\\
\\
2 g (\mu + e )\left(\sqrt{\frac{2 d_{sl}}{a_i}}+t_{pc}-t_{prt}\right), &amp; \text{if } V_{ACDA_{si2}} &lt; V_{ACDA_s} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_{si1}} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_d} \text{ or } V_{cs} \text{ or } V_{cl}\\
\\
 \frac{d_{ACDA_d}}{t_g}, &amp; \text{if } V_{ACDA_d}&lt; V_{ACDA_s} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_{si1}} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_{si2}} \text{ or } V_{cs} \text{ or } V_{cl} \\
\\
 \sqrt{ \frac{(\mu+e) g r}{1-\mu e}}, &amp; \text{if } V_{cs}&lt;V_{ACDA_s} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_{si1}} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_{si2}} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_d} \text{ or } V_{cl} \\
\\
 V_{cl}, &amp; \text{if } V_{cl}&lt; V_{ACDA_s} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_{si 1}} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_{si 2}} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_d} \text{ or } V_{cs}
\end{cases}

&lt;/math&gt;

The value of the variable "e" is the [[sine]] of the [[angle]] of inclination of the road's [[slope]]. For a level road this value is zero, and for [[Small-angle approximation|small angles]] it approximates the road's percent [[Grade (slope)|grade]] divided by one hundred.
:&lt;math&gt;
e = \sin(\theta) \approx \theta \approx \tan(\theta) = \frac{\%grade}{100}
&lt;/math&gt;

{{refn|
In most jurisdictions, [[judicial notice]] shall be taken of the [[braking distance#Total stopping distance|total stopping distance]], and such notice is therefore logically and substantively taken of the maximum speed permitted to brake within the stopping distance as applied to the ACDA. The latter is merely the [[inverse function]] of the former. Furthermore, fundamental mathematical relationships are themselves subject to judicial notice.

&lt;math&gt;V_{ACDA(s)}=\sqrt{\mu^2 g^2 t_{prt}^2+ 2 \mu g d_{ACDA_s} } - \mu g t_{prt}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, using the &lt;math&gt;\mu=0.7&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_{prt}=1.5&lt;/math&gt; values that produced [http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-880/ Code of Virginia § 46.2-880 Tables of speed and stopping distances], one simply obtains the same velocities that produced the [[braking distance#Total stopping distance|stopping distance]] in the statute:

&lt;math&gt;V_{ACDA} \approx \sqrt{1372.3+ 177.8 d_{ACDA} } - 37.0&lt;/math&gt;

[[United States customary units|US customary]] – Speed in [[Miles per hour|MPH]] from distance in [[Foot (unit)|feet]]:
&lt;math&gt;V_{ACDA} \approx \sqrt{529.8+ 20.9 d_{ACDA} } - 23.0&lt;/math&gt;

The maximum velocity permitted by the Assured Clear Distance Ahead is controlling of safe speed (V&lt;sub&gt;BSL&lt;/sub&gt;) for only the top and two cases.

For the top case, the maximum speed is governed by the assured clear "line-of-sight", as when the "following distance" aft of forward traffic and "steering control" are both adequate. Common examples include when there is no vehicle to be viewed, or when there is a haze or fog that would prevent visualizing a close vehicle in front. This maximum velocity is denoted by the case variable &lt;math&gt;V_{ACDA_s}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[coefficient of friction|friction coefficient]] is symbolized by &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;—and itself a function of the [[Treadwear rating|tire type]] and [[road slipperiness|road conditions]], the distance &lt;math&gt;d_{ACDA_s}&lt;/math&gt; is the static ACDA, the constant &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gravity of Earth|acceleration of gravity]], and interval &lt;math&gt;t_{prt}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Mental chronometry|perception-reaction time]]—usually between 1.0 and 2.5 seconds.&lt;ref name="Taoka"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taoka |first1=George T. |title=Brake Reaction Times of Unalerted Drivers |journal=ITE Journal |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages= 19–21 |date=March 1989 |url=http://www.ite.org/membersonly/itejournal/pdf/jca89a19.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olsen&amp;Sivak"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Perception-response time to unexpected roadway hazards |author1=Paul L.

See [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead#Table of ACDA: forward line-of-sight|Table of safe speed versus forward line-of-sight]]

===ACDA: horizontal line-of-sight===
The second case describes the relationship of horizontal sight distance on safe speed. It is the maximum speed at which a vehicle can come to a full stop before an object, with speed V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, can intercept after having emerged and traveled across the horizontal sight distance "d&lt;sub&gt;hsd&lt;/sub&gt;." Urban and residential areas have horizontal sight distances that tend to be closely obstructed by parked cars, utility poles, street furnishing, fencing, signage, and landscaping, but have slower intercepting speeds of children, pedestrians, backing cars, and domestic animals. These interceptors combined with dense usage results in collisions that are more probable and much more likely to inflict harm to an outside human life. In rural areas, swift-moving spooked wildlife such as [[deer]],&lt;ref name="deer"/&gt; [[elk]], [[Moose#Vehicle collisions|moose]], and [[pronghorn|antelope]] are more likely to intercept a roadway at over 30&amp;nbsp;mph (48 kph). Wildlife will frequently transit across a road before a full stop is necessary, however collisions with large [[Game (hunting)|game]] are foreseeably lethal, and a driver generally has a duty not to harm his or her passengers. The foreseeable intercept speed or defectively designed horizontal sight distance may vary "reasonably" with [[judicial discretion]].

See [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead#Table of ACDA: horizontal line-of-sight|Table of safe speed versus horizontal line-of-sight]]

===ACDA: intersectional setback===
This third case regards safe speed around un-signalized intersections where a driver on an uncontrolled through street has a duty to slow down in crossing an intersection and permit [[stop sign|controlled]] drivers to be able pass through the intersection without danger of collision.&lt;ref name="213 Cal. 644"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Page v. Mazzei, 213 Cal. 644 |vol=213 |reporter=Official California Reports |opinion=644 |pinpoint= |court=[[Supreme Court of California]] |date=21 September 1931 |url=https://casetext.com/case/page-v-mazzei |accessdate= |quote=Where a car has actually entered an intersection before the other approaches it, the driver of the first car has the right to assume that he will be given the right of way and be permitted to pass through the intersection without danger of collision. He has a right to assume that the driver of the other car will obey the law, slow down, and yield the right of way, if slowing down be necessary to prevent a collision. ( Keyes v. Hawley, 100 Cal. App. 53, 60 [279 Pac. 674].) Nor is a plaintiff required to yield the right of way to one a considerable distance away whose duty it is to slow down in crossing an intersection. See [http://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/CACourts/ Official Reports Opinions Online]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driver on the through street must anticipate and hence not approach at an unsafe speed which would prevent another driver from being able to enter while traffic was some distance away, or would be unsafe to a driver who has already established control of the intersection under a prudent acceleration a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, from a stop at a limit line a distance d&lt;sub&gt;sl&lt;/sub&gt; away.&lt;ref name=AASHO&gt;{{cite book |title=A Policy on Geometric Design of Rural Highways |publisher=American Association of State Highway and Traffic Officials |date=1969 |page=394 |quote=Where an obstruction, which cannot be removed except at prohibitive cost, fixes the vertices of the sight triangle at points that are less than the safe stopping distances from the intersection, vehicles may be brought to a stop (after sighting other vehicles on the intersecting road) only if they are traveling at a speed appropriate to the available sight distance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ACDA: following distance===
The pedantic fourth case applies when the dynamic ACDA "following distance" (d&lt;sub&gt;ACDA&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) is less than the static ACDA "line-of-sight" distance (d&lt;sub&gt;ACDA&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;). A classic instance of this occurs when, from a visibility perspective, it would be safe to drive much faster were it not for a slower-moving vehicle ahead. As such, the dynamic ACDA is governing the basic speed rule, because in maintaining this distance, one cannot drive at a faster speed than that matching the forward vehicle. The "time gap" t&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; or "time cushion" is the time required to travel the dynamic ACDA or "following distance" at the [[operating speed]]. Circumstances depending, this cushion might be manifested as a [[two-second rule]] or three-second rule.

See [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead#Table of following distances|Table of 2-second following distances]]

===Critical speed===
In the fifth case, critical speed V&lt;sub&gt;cs&lt;/sub&gt; applies when road curvature is the factor limiting safe speed. A vehicle which exceeds this speed will [[slip angle|slide]] out of its lane. Critical speed is a function of curve [[radius]] "r," [[superelevation]] or banking "e," and friction coefficient "μ;"&lt;ref name="J. Stannard Baker"/&gt; the constant "g" again is the acceleration of gravity. However, most motorists will not tolerate a lateral acceleration exceeding 0.3g (μ=0.3) above which many will panic.&lt;ref name="Glennon-Hill"&gt;{{cite book |title=Roadway Safety and Tort Liability |edition=2 |publisher=Lawyers &amp; Judges Publishing Company, Inc. |author1=John C. Glennon |author2=Paul F.

Inc. |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of critical speed is often applied to the problem of [[traffic calming]], where curvature is both used to govern maximum road speed, and used in [[traffic circles]] as a device to force drivers to obey their [[Duty of care|duty]] to slow down when approaching an intersection.&lt;ref name="106 Cal. App. 2d 294"/&gt;&lt;ref name="179 Cal. 349"/&gt;

See [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead#Table of critical speeds|Table of curvatures and critical speeds]]

===Surface control===
The bottom case is invoked when the maximum velocity for surface control V&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt; is otherwise reached. Steering control is independent from any concept of clear distance ahead. If a vehicle cannot be controlled so as to safely remain within its lane above a certain speed and circumstance, then it is irrelevant how assuredly clear the distance is ahead. Using the example of the previous case, the safe speed on a curve may be such that a driver experiences a lateral acceleration of less than 0.3g despite that the vehicle may not slide until it experiences 0.8g.

===Relationship of posted speed limits to the explicitness of driver care standard===
[[File:2005 winter road dipped beam.jpg|thumb|Distance seen with [[ECE Regulations|ECE]] light by night]]

Many people are challenged by the concept of ''unsafe speed'' because they find it vague and arbitrary.&lt;ref name="void for vagueness"/&gt; It is well known that people instead resolve such challenges by [[attribute substitution]],&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |date=December 2003 |title=Maps of Bounded Rationality: Psychology for Behavioral Economics |journal= American Economic Review |volume=93 |issue=5 |pages=1449–1475 |doi=10.1257/000282803322655392 |issn=0002-8282 |citeseerx=10.1.1.194.6554 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which in this case can mean simply emulating the behaviors of others. In accord with the [[cultural theory of risk]], indeed a substantial part of a driver's [[risk perception]] comes from comparing their contemplated conduct to the behavior of others; this includes the safeness of a given speed, notwithstanding the actual risk. As a result of this uncorrected vagueness, group behavior can often be in opposition to safe speed and still be governing a hazardous posted speed limit. By Federal law, posted speed limits are generally within 5&amp;nbsp;mph of the 85th-percentile speed of free-flowing traffic.&lt;ref name="AASHTO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="23 CFR 603"/&gt;&lt;ref name="23 CFR 625"&gt;{{cite web |title=Title 23 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 625.4 |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/23/625.4 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US MUTCD"&gt;{{cite book |title=Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD)|url=http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/ |chapter=2009 Edition Chapter 2B.

Let us decide how fast we want to travel." Although the court threw out a speeding ticket Mr. Stanko had received for traveling 102 miles an hour, it upheld two reckless driving counts -- one for traveling 117 m.p.h., the other for 121 m.p.h. Both violations were on two-lane highways as he crested a hill.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be able to guarantee "assurance" beyond proximate edge of clear visibility, in doing so exempting ACDA duty, a road must be designed and maintained such that there is not a chance of obstruction in one's lane beyond the proximate edge of clear visibility. A road's vertical [[Geometric design of roads#Profile|profile]] must be assured to have such a curvature as not to hide hazards close behind its crests. [[Discretion]] for drivers and pedestrians to enter onto a potentially occupied lane from a side street must be assuredly eliminated such as with fences, merge lanes, or signalized access. There must also be an assurance of no opportunity for animals and debris to enter from side lots, and that there are continuous multi-hourly maintenance [[highway patrol|patrols]] performed. Furthermore, such road sections must be distinguished from other roads so that the driver could clearly and immediately know when he or she may or may not take such extended "assurance." Few roads might meet these requirements except some of the highest functional classification [[controlled-access highways]] such as [[freeways]] and [[autobahn]]s.&lt;ref name="FHWA"/&gt;

Even if such criteria are met, the law must also exempt driver liability for maintaining clear distance ahead. In most democracies, such liability for failures of the distance to remain clear beyond line of sight would ultimately be transferred to its taxpayers.&lt;ref name="Kenworthy"/&gt; This only generally occurs when governments have been tasked by constituents or their courts to take the responsibly to design and maintain roadways that "assure" the distance will be clear beyond the proximate edge of clear visibility. Pressures to make such changes may arise from cultural [[Wikibooks:Professionalism/Diane Vaughan and the normalization of deviance|normalization of deviance]] and unnecessary risk, misunderstanding the purpose of the road [[functional classification]] system, underestimation of increased risk, and reclamation of commute time.&lt;ref name="FHWA"/&gt;

One of the greatest difficulties created by such an extension of the ACDA is the frequency at which roads reduce their [[functional classification]]&lt;ref name="FHWA"/&gt; unbeknownst to drivers who continue unaware they have lost this extended "assurance" or don't understand the difference. Such nuance in applicable jurisdictions is a prolific source of accidents.&lt;ref name="106 Cal. App. 2d 294"/&gt; In the [[United States]], there is no explicit road marking promising clear distance beyond line of sight in the [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]], although there are [[Road signs in the United States#W19 Series: End of Controlled Access Highway|signs]] communicating "[https://web.archive.org/web/20160915123237/http://www.trafficsigns.com/w14-4-limited-sight-distance-sign.html limited sight distance]," "[http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009r1r2/part2/part2c.htm#section2C18 hill blocks view]," "[http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009r1r2/part2/part2c.htm#section2C46 crossroad ahead]," and "[http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009r1r2/part2/part2c.htm#section2C24 freeway ends]."&lt;ref name="MUTCD"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/pdfs/2009r1r2/pdf_index.htm |title=Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways |publisher=US Dept. of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration |edition=2009 |year=2012 |pages=117, 119, 127 |isbn=978-1598045369 |quote=The use of warning signs should be kept to a minimum as the unnecessary use of warning signs tends to breed disrespect for all signs.(2C.02.02)...Vehicular Traffic Warning signs should be used only at locations where the road user's sight distance is restricted, or the condition, activity, or entering traffic would be unexpected.(2C.49.03)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partial solution to this challenge is to remove driver discretion in determining whether the ACDA is extended beyond line of sight, by explicitly designating this law change to certain marked high functional classification roadways having meet strict engineering criteria.&lt;ref name="FHWA"/&gt;

[[File:Free body.svg|thumb|Forces on a vehicle skidding down a grade of angle ''θ''.]]

Starting with [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's Second law|Newton's Second Law of Motion]] and the Laws of [[Friction]]:

:&lt;math&gt; F_\text{total} = F_\text{friction} + F_\text{gravity} \sin{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; F_\text{total} = \mu F_\text{normal} + m g \sin{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; F_\text{total} = \mu m g \cos{\theta} + m g \sin{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

Equating the net [[force]] to [[mass]] times [[acceleration]]:

:&lt;math&gt; F_\text{total}= m a &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mu m g \cos{\theta} + m g \sin{\theta} = m a &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; a = g(\mu \cos{\theta} + \sin{\theta}) &lt;/math&gt;

Invoking the [[Equations of motion#Uniform acceleration|equations of motion]] and substituting acceleration:

:&lt;math&gt; d = \frac{v^2}{ 2 a} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; d = \frac{v^2}{ 2 g(\mu \cos{\theta} + \sin{\theta})} &lt;/math&gt;

[[Small-angle approximation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \sin{\theta} \approx \theta &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \cos{\theta} \approx 1 - \frac {\theta^2}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the small angle approximations, and exploiting that the product of a small angle squared, in radians, with the friction coefficient, θ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;μ, is insignificant (for a steep 20% slope and a good friction coef. of 0.8, this equals (.2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;x0.8≈0.03):

:&lt;math&gt; d \approx \frac{v^2}{ 2 g[\mu (1 - \frac {\theta^2}{2} ) + \theta]} \approx \frac{v^2}{ 2 g(\mu + \theta)}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, the total stopping distance is the sum of the braking and perception-reaction distances:

:&lt;math&gt; d_\text{total} = d_\text{braking} + d_\text{perception-reaction} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; d_\text{total} \approx \frac{v^2}{ 2 g(\mu + \theta)} + v t_{pr} &lt;/math&gt;

Isolating zero as preparation to solve for velocity:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2 g (\mu + \theta)} v^2 + v t_{prt} - d_\text{total} \approx 0 &lt;/math&gt;

[[Completing the square]] or invoking the [[quadratic formula]] to find the solution:

:&lt;math&gt; v \approx \sqrt{(\mu + \theta)^2 g^2 t_{prt}^2+ 2 (\mu + \theta) g d_\text{total} } - ( \mu + \theta ) g t_{prt} &lt;/math&gt;

Use [[small-angle approximation]] to obtain a more field-able version of the above solution in terms of percent [[Grade (slope)|grade]]/100 "[[superelevation|e]]" instead of an angle θ in radians:

:&lt;math&gt; \theta \approx \tan(\theta) = \frac{\%grade}{100} &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the angle as described produces the form of the formula of case 1 ():

:&lt;math&gt; V_{BSL1} \approx \sqrt{(\mu + e)^2 g^2 t_{prt}^2+ 2 (\mu + e) g d_{ACDA} } - (\mu+e) g t_{prt} &lt;/math&gt;

The Basic Speed Law constrains the Assured Clear Distance Ahead to the total stopping distance, and the small angle value of [[Grade (slope)|road grades]] approximates the [[superelevation]] "e."

Many roadways are level, in which case the small angle approximations or superelevation may be dropped altogether:
:&lt;math&gt; V_{BSL1} = \sqrt{\mu^2 g^2 t_{prt}^2+ 2 \mu g d_{ACDA} } - \mu g t_{prt} &lt;/math&gt;

''This model ignores the effects of [[air drag]], [[rolling resistance]], [[Lift (force)|lift]], and [[Theory of relativity|relativity]] as a vehicle's great [[momentum]] and [[weight]] dominate these factors; they increase the complexity of the formulas while insubstantially changing the outcomes in practically all driving situations except ultra-low-mass [[bicycles]] stopping from inherently dangerously high speeds; usability to the layman and conformance with current standard engineering assumptions&lt;ref name="AASHTO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VA Table"/&gt; is the objective and a vehicle's [http://hpwizard.com/aerodynamics.html lift factor] is often inaccessible.

The time required to travel down a road at speed v to said obstruction of distance d away:

:&lt;math&gt; t= \frac{d}{v} &lt;/math&gt;

Equating the two times:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{v} = \frac{d_i}{v_i} &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for this distance:
:&lt;math&gt; d=\frac{v d_{i}}{v_i} &lt;/math&gt;

Equating this to the total stopping distance, which is the sum of braking and perception-reaction distances:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{v d_{i}}{v_i} = \frac{v^2}{2 g (\mu + e)} + v t_{prt} &lt;/math&gt;

Isolating zero, and factoring out a v:
:&lt;math&gt; v \left[ \frac{v}{2 g (\mu + e)} + \left(t_{prt} - \frac{ d_{i}}{v_i}\right) \right] = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for the non-trivial case (or may distribute v in equation above and apply quadratic formula for same result):
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{v}{2 g (\mu + e)} + (t_{prt} - \frac{ d_{i}}{v_i}) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The solution to the above equation, which provides the maximum safe speed as a function of horizontal sight distance, intercept velocity, and road-tire friction coefficient:

The time required for a vehicle to enter a controlled intersection from a stop is the sum of the perception time (t&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;), the time required to actuate an automatic transmission or shift to first gear (t&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;), and the time to accelerate and enter or traverse the road (t&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;). The sum of the first two quantities is t&lt;sub&gt;pc&lt;/sub&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; t= t_p + t_c + t_a = t_{pc} + t_a &lt;/math&gt;

The time required for a vehicle entering with acceleration a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to transect the sum of the setback and shoulder distances d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; under uniform acceleration a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; from a stop via the [[Equations of motion#Constant linear acceleration: collinear vectors|equations of motion]]:

:&lt;math&gt; t_a =\sqrt{ \frac{ 2 d_i }{a_i} } &lt;/math&gt;

The time required to travel down a road at speed v to said obstruction of distance d away:

:&lt;math&gt; t= \frac{d}{v} &lt;/math&gt;

Equating the two times:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{v} =\sqrt{ \frac{ 2 d_i }{a_i} } + t_{pc} &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for this distance:
:&lt;math&gt; d = v \left( \sqrt{ \frac{ 2 d_i }{a_i} } + t_{pc} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Equating this to the total stopping distance, which is the sum of braking and perception-reaction distances:
:&lt;math&gt; v \left( \sqrt{ \frac{ 2 d_i }{a_i} } + t_{pc} \right) = \frac{v^2}{2 g (\mu + e)} + v t_{prt} &lt;/math&gt;

Isolating zero, and factoring out a v:
:&lt;math&gt; v [ \frac{v}{2 g (\mu + e)} + \left( t_{prt} - \sqrt{ \frac{ 2 d_i }{a_i} } - t_{pc} \right) ] = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for the non-trivial case (or may distribute v in equation above and apply quadratic formula for same result):
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{v}{2 g (\mu + e)} + \left( t_{prt} - \sqrt{ \frac{ 2 d_i }{a_i} } - t_{pc} \right) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The solution to the above equation, which provides the maximum safe speed as a function of horizontal setback, intercept acceleration, and road-tire friction coefficient:

[[File:Free body.svg|thumb|Forces on a vehicle skidding down a grade of angle ''θ''.]]

Starting with [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's Second law|Newton's Laws of Motion]], the Laws of [[Friction]], and [[Centripetal force#Formula|Centripetal force]]:

:&lt;math&gt; F_\text{centripetal} \cos{ \theta } = F_\text{friction} + F_\text{gravity} \sin{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting formulas for [[Centripetal force#Formula|Centripetal force]], frictional force, and gravitational force:

:&lt;math&gt; m \frac{v^2}{r} \cos{ \theta } = \mu F_\text{normal} + m g \sin{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

The normal force is equal and opposite to the sum of the gravitational and centripetal components:

:&lt;math&gt; m \frac{v^2}{r} \cos{ \theta } = \mu (m g \cos{\theta} + m \frac{v^2}{r} \sin{ \theta } ) + m g \sin{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

Isolate &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; terms:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{v^2}{r} \cos{ \theta } - \mu \frac{v^2}{r} \sin{ \theta } = g (\mu \cos{\theta} + \sin{\theta} ) &lt;/math&gt;

Then solve for &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; v^2 ( \cos{ \theta } - \mu \sin{ \theta } ) = g r (\mu \cos{\theta} + \sin{\theta} ) &lt;/math&gt;

To obtain:
:&lt;math&gt; v = \sqrt { \frac{g r (\mu \cos{\theta} + \sin{\theta} ) } { \cos{ \theta } - \mu \sin{ \theta } } } &lt;/math&gt;
This is the full solution, however most corners are banked at less than 15 degrees (≈28% grade), so in such conditions, a fieldable small angle approximation may be used.

Substituting [[small-angle approximation]]s sinθ≈θ, cos≈1-θ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2:

:&lt;math&gt; v \approx \sqrt { \frac{g r [\mu (1- \frac {\theta^2} {2}) + \theta ] } { 1- \frac {\theta^2}{2} - \mu \theta } } &lt;/math&gt;

Exploit that a small angle squared, in radians, is insignificant by substituting θ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;≈0 which obtains the formula used in case 5 (also tanθ≈e):

:&lt;math&gt; v \approx \sqrt { \frac{g r (\mu + \theta ) } { 1 - \mu \theta } } \approx \sqrt { \frac{g r (\mu + e ) } { 1 - \mu e } } &lt;/math&gt;

|extra2     = font-size:120%; padding-left:3em;
}}
The ''seconds-of-distance-to-stop rule'' is derived as follows.

We first obtain the total stopping distance and then convert it into travel time, which is more easily applicable by the driver.

:&lt;math&gt; d_\text{total} = d_\text{braking} + d_\text{perception-reaction} &lt;/math&gt;

Invoking the [[Equations of motion#Uniform acceleration|equations of motion]],

:&lt;math&gt;d_\text{braking} = \frac{v^2}{2 a}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;d_\text{total} = \frac{v^2}{2 a} + v t_\text{prt}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;a=\mu g&lt;/math&gt;.

The time it takes to casually traverse the stopping distance at the travel speed is

:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{d_\text{total}}{v}&lt;/math&gt;.

Substituting the former into the latter,

:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{v}{2 \mu g}+t_\text{prt}&lt;/math&gt;.

This can be simplified into the rule-of-thumb form

:&lt;math&gt;t=C \cdot v + t_\text{prt}&lt;/math&gt;

by noting that

:&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{f}{2 \mu g}&lt;/math&gt;.

Substituting (US Customary units)

:&lt;math&gt;\mu \approx \tfrac{7}{10}&lt;/math&gt; (dry) or &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5}{10}&lt;/math&gt; (wet) or &lt;math&gt;\lessapprox \tfrac{2}{10}&lt;/math&gt; (snow);  &lt;math&gt;g \approx 32\;{\rm ft}\;{\rm s}^{-2} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f=\tfrac{22\;{\rm ft}\;{\rm s}^{-1}}{15\;{\rm mi\;h^{-1}}}&lt;/math&gt; (convert mph to fps); &lt;math&gt;t_{prt}=1.5\;{\rm s}&lt;/math&gt;,

we have

:&lt;math&gt;C=\tfrac{1}{30}&lt;/math&gt; (dry),  &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{1}{20}&lt;/math&gt; (wet), and &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{1}{10}&lt;/math&gt; (snow).

This results in a seconds-of-distance-to-stop rule (in MPH) of

:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{v}{30} + 1.5&lt;/math&gt; (dry pavement)

:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{v}{20} + 1.5&lt;/math&gt; (wet pavement)

:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{v}{10} + 1.5&lt;/math&gt; (snow, hard-packed).

The dry rule does allow one to travel faster in dry weather, but expect emergency deceleration to be a bit uncomfortable. If one desires to remember only one rule, use the wet one. However, because the difference between wet and dry is half-a-second at 30 MPH and one second at 60 MPH, and because dividing by two is easier than three, we can use a correctable rule of thumb:

:::&lt;math&gt;\color{Sepia}{t\approx\frac{v}{20} + 1 \quad \text{(general rule of thumb)}}&lt;/math&gt; ''(instead add 2+ in wet or complex conditions, and also instead divide by 10 in snow/ice)''

For example, a speed of {{convert|60|mph}} corresponds to stopping distance of 4 seconds' travel at 60&amp;nbsp;mph. Drivers that require additional perception-reaction time, such as novices, elderly, or those in complex or adverse environments, can benefit by adding additional seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effects of uncertainty, transmission type, driver age and gender on brake reaction and movement time. |author1=Lora Warshawsky-Livne |author2=David Shinar |journal=Journal of Safety Research |volume=33 |issue=1 |date=Spring 2000 |pages=117–128 |issn=0022-4375 |doi=10.1016/S0022-4375(02)00006-3 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437502000063 |quote=Perception-reaction time increased significantly from 0.32 to 0.42 s (P&lt;.05) as uncertainty increased but brake-movement time did not change.

The time to traverse your stopping distance at travel speed should not be confused with the braking time to come to a full stop, which is a number nearly twice this value ( {{math| &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}{{sfrac|&lt;var&gt;v&lt;/var&gt;|&lt;VAR&gt;&amp;mu;&lt;/VAR&gt; g}}+t&lt;sub&gt;ptr&lt;/sub&gt;}} ). As one is continually slowing down while braking, it will naturally take longer to get to the stopping limit.

A more correct perception-reaction time of one-and-a-half seconds is commonly used by the mathematically inclined.&lt;ref name="VA Table"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olsen&amp;Sivak"/&gt; Doing so to obtain your "seconds-of-distance-to-stop" for ''dry pavement'' and then converting time to actual distance by multiplying it by the travel velocity and {{math|{{sfrac|22|15}}}} to convert MPH to fps will yield results in close agreement with [http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-880/ this table].

Whereas most driving is done below {{convert|80|mph}}, ''maintaining a blanket 5 or 6 seconds of travel time to the edge of visibility'' ({{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;var&gt;{{=}}{{sfrac|80|20}}+1}}), ''will keep drivers in compliance with the ACDA rule in most simple highway driving conditions – day or night'' – with growing error towards safety at lower speeds.

On final note, slope has an effect on stopping distance. An additional second or so will need to be added when stopping while traveling down a steep incline, and conversely driving uphill will improve breaking.&lt;ref name="AASHTO"/&gt; This is accounting that a level road was assumed in the rule of thumb.

This table demonstrates why [[alley]]ways, [[parking lots]], [[parks]], and [[residential areas]] frequently set 5-15&amp;nbsp;mph speed limits when the side clearance from the road is less than 15 feet. An urban or residential street which permits a maximum speed limit of 25&amp;nbsp;mph under its very best conditions (roadsides cleared of visual obstructions past a 20-foot maintained [[right of way]]), may in practice be unsafe to drive at more than 10&amp;nbsp;mph within sections with utilized curbside parking. This table also suggests that the safe speed could be greater than a statutory 25&amp;nbsp;mph posted speed, where roadside clearance is sufficient such that no "foreseeable" object could emerge from the proximate edge of roadside visibility, transect the cleared area, and intercept the lane before the driver could come to a halt. However, wary road design engineers may have differing views of foreseeable intercept speeds than that reflected by the 85th percentile speed chosen by the public. This can have unfortunate consequences where a mass commuting public is unfamiliar with or does not appreciate specific local hazards. Narrow lane widths are purposely used for [[traffic calming]], because careful drivers universally choose their speed depending on the roadway width.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nacto.org/publication/urban-street-design-guide/street-design-elements/lane-width/ |title=Urban Street Design Guide: Lane Width |publisher=National Association of City Transportation Officials |quote=as the width of the lane increased, the speed of the roadway increased}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standard horizontal clearances are commonly set by [[AASHTO]] guidelines or a jurisdiction's department of transportation.&lt;ref name="AASHTO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/oppd/hdm/pdf/english/chp0300.pdf |title=CAHDM |pages=300–25 |quote=309.1 Horizontal Clearances for Highways: The horizontal clearance to all roadside objects should be based on engineering judgment with the objective of maximizing the distance between roadside objects and the edge of traveled way.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1620">'''BSTAR''' is a way of modeling [[aerodynamic drag]] on a satellite in the [[SGP4]] satellite orbit propagation model.

Traditionally, aerodynamic resistance ("drag") is given by

:&lt;math&gt;F_D = \frac{1}{2} \rho C_d A v^2&lt;/math&gt;

where
&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[air density]],
&lt;math&gt;C_d&lt;/math&gt; is the [[drag coefficient]],
&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the frontal area, and
&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity.

The acceleration due to drag is then

:&lt;math&gt;a_D = \frac{F_D}{m} = \frac{\rho C_d A v^2}{2m} &lt;/math&gt;

In [[aerodynamic]] theory, the factor

:&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{C_d A}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

is called the [[ballistic coefficient]], and its unit is area per mass. Further incorporating a reference air density and the factor of two in the denominator, we get the ''starred'' ballistic coefficient:

:&lt;math&gt;B^* = \frac{\rho_0 B}{2} = \frac{\rho_0 C_d A}{2m}&lt;/math&gt;

thus reducing the expression for the acceleration due to drag to

:&lt;math&gt;a_D = \frac{\rho}{\rho_0} B^* v^2&lt;/math&gt;

As it can be seen, &lt;math&gt;B^*&lt;/math&gt; has a unit of inverse length. For orbit propagation purposes, there is a field for BSTAR drag in [[Two-line element set]] (TLE) files, where it is to be given in units of inverse Earth radii. The corresponding reference air density is given as 0.1570&amp;nbsp;kg/m^2/Earth radii.&lt;ref&gt;https://celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/spacetrk.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5631">'''Being-in-itself''' is the self-contained and fully realized [[Being]] of objects.  It is a term used in early 20th century [[continental philosophy]], especially in the works of [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], and the [[existentialism|existentialists]].

==Being-in-itself for Heidegger==
{{Main|Heideggerian terminology}}

In the philosophy of Martin Heidegger, Being-in-itself is contrasted with the being of persons, which he terms [[Dasein]]. {{Harv|Heidegger|1962|p=H.27}}  "Dasein means: care of the Being of beings as such that is ecstatically disclosed in care, not only of human Being...Dasein is ''itself'' by virtue of its essential ''relation to'' Being in general." {{Harv|Heidegger |2000|p=H.31}}  Heidegger recognized the dangers inherent to talking about Being in general and particular beings, and thus devoted space in ''[[Being and Time]]'' and the ''Introduction to Metaphysics'' to an explication of the differences; often noted by translators who distinguish Being (Sein), from ''a'' being (das Seiende).  His attention to the complication is helpful for those who are looking for detailed explanation, but rarely clears the air of confusions.

Dasein is Being that is aware of, and interested in, its own Being.  Dasein is, by its nature, invested in social interaction and society.  This is because in Heidegger's metaphysical system, one of the most fundamental ways to understand Being is through relationships.  All things stand in a relation to all other things — and by virtue of his stress on Dasein's [[ontological]] distinction, things may also stand in relation to Dasein. {{Harv|Heidegger|1962|p=H.78}}  The argument for this claim draws heavily on [[Hegel|Hegel's]] great work, the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.  Essentially, Being in itself is one of Heidegger's main concerns throughout his authorship.  Despite Heidegger's interest in it, he returns — more often than not indirectly — to the subject by interrogating other concepts that simply ''invoke'' Being without explicitly acknowledging it.

In other words, whereas Heidegger calls the being of persons 'Dasein', he determines 'Being in itself' to be at the same time the most vague and general concept possible to contemplate, but also the topic of greatest interest to him as a [[philosopher]].

==Being-in-itself for Sartre==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology]] --&gt;
In Sartrean existentialism, being-in-itself (''être-en-soi'') is also contrasted with the being of persons, which he describes as a combination of, or vacillation or tension between, [[being for itself|being-for-itself]] (''être-pour-soi'') and [[being for others|being-for-others]] (''I'être-pour-autrui''). {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Being-in-itself refers to objects in the external world — a mode of existence that simply is. It is not conscious so it is neither active nor passive and harbors no potentiality for transcendence. This mode of being is relevant to inanimate objects, but not to humans, who Sartre says must always make a choice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm "Existentialism Is a Humanism", Lecture by J.P. Sartre, 1946.]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the problems of human existence for Sartre is the desire to attain being-in-itself, which he describes as the desire to be [[God]] — this is a longing for full control over one's destiny and for absolute identity, only attainable by achieving full control over the destiny of all existence. The desire to be God is one of the ways people fall into [[Bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Sartre's famous depiction of a man in a café who has applied himself to a portrayal of his role as a waiter illustrates this. The waiter thinks of himself as being a waiter (as in being-in-itself), which Sartre says is impossible since he cannot be a waiter in the sense that an inkwell is an inkwell. He is primarily a man (being-for-itself), just one who happens to be functioning as a waiter – with no fixed nature or essence, who is constantly recreating himself. He is guilty of focusing on himself as being-in-itself and not being-for-itself. Sartre would say that as a human, a being-for-itself by nature, the waiter is "a being that is not what it is and it is what it is not." Therefore, the waiter who acts as if he is at his very core a waiter "is not what [he] is"- which is to say, he is not solely a waiter- and "is what [he] is not"- meaning that he is many things other than a waiter. In simply playing the part of a waiter, the man in this example is reducing himself to a "being-in-itself" and is therefore in [[Bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2348">'''Blau space''' consists of the multidimensional [[coordinate system]], created by considering the set of [[demographics|socio-demographic]] variables as dimensions.  All socio-demographic characteristics are potential elements of Blau space, including continuous characteristics such as age, years of education, income, occupational prestige, geographic location, and so forth. In addition, categorical measures of socio-demographic characteristics such as race, sex, religion, birthplace, and others are Blau dimensions. "Blau space" is a [[theory|theoretical]] construct which was developed by Miller McPherson and named after [[Peter Blau]].  It was later elaborated by McPherson and Ranger-Moore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McPherson, Miller|title=Ecology of Affiliation|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=48|year=1983|pages=519–532|doi=10.2307/2117719}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McPherson|first1=Miller|first2=James|last2=Ranger-Moore|title=Evolution on a Dancing Landscape: Organizations and Networks in Dynamic Blau Space|journal=Social Forces|volume=70|year=1991|pages=19–42|jstor=10.2307/2580060|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/1991/mcpherson1991a.pdf|doi=10.1093/sf/70.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organizing force in Blau space is the [[homophily]] principle, which argues that the [[information flow|flow of information]] from person to person is a declining function of [[distance function|distance]] in Blau space.  Persons located at great distance in Blau space are very unlikely to interact, which creates the conditions for social differences in any characteristic that is transmitted through social [[communication]].  The homophily principle thus localizes communication in Blau space, leading to the development of social [[ecological niche|niche]]s for human activity and [[social organization]].

Although the idea of Blau Space was originally developed to consider individuals, it was extended to the context of cities (and other urban units) in Neal's "Building a Blauürban Space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Zachary P.

This contrasts with [[exponential growth]], which is constantly increasing at an accelerating rate, and therefore approaches infinity in the limit.

An example of bounded growth is the [[logistic function]].

'''Causation in English law''' concerns the legal tests of [[Remoteness (law)|remoteness]], causation and foreseeability in the [[tort]] of negligence. It is also relevant for [[English criminal law]] and [[English contract law]].

In the [[English law]] of [[negligence]], '''causation''' proves a direct link between the [[defendant]]’s [[negligence]] and the [[claimant]]’s loss and damage. For these purposes, liability in [[negligence]] is established when there is a [[breach of duty in English law|breach]] of the [[duty of care in English law|duty of care]] owed by the defendant to the claimant that '''causes''' loss and damage, and it is reasonable that the defendant should compensate the [[claimant]] for that loss and damage. 

==Public policy==
Policy at this level is less than [[public policy (law)|''ordre public'']], but nevertheless significant.  The policy is to give bound to the scope of people who can claim damages, how much they can claim, and within what timeframe.

The claimant must prove that the breach of the duty of care caused actionable damage. The test for these purposes is a balance between proximity and remoteness: 
*that there was a factual link between what the defendant did or failed to do, and the loss and damage sustained by the claimant, and
*that it was reasonably foreseeable at the relevant time that this behaviour would cause loss and damage of that type. 
To clarify the nature of the judicial process, in ''Lamb v Camden LBC'' (1981) QB 625, [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] said:
:"The truth is that all these three – duty, remoteness and causation – are all devices by which the courts limit the range of liability for negligence . . .  All these devices are useful in their way. But ultimately it is a question of policy for the judges to decide." 
In other words, the court's main task is to do [[justice]] as between these [[party (law)|parties]] in their present situation. For this purpose, a weighing evaluative process is required, rather than a clear-cut rule of law. For example, in ''Meah v McCreamer and others (No. 2)'' (1986) 1 AER 943, the claimant suffered head injuries and brain damage as a result of the defendant's negligent driving, which led to a [[personality disorder]]. Four years later, he sexually assaulted and raped three women. The illegal nature of his conduct was not raised at the [[trial (law)|civil trial]], and the claimant was held entitled to [[damages]] to compensate him for being imprisoned following his [[conviction (law)|conviction]]. In separate proceedings, the three women assaulted obtained a judgment for compensation, so he sought indemnification from the negligent driver and his insurers for the amounts he had been ordered to pay. This was not a claim for his own personal injuries nor direct financial loss, but indirect loss. The three women could not have sued the driver directly because they were not foreseeable and so no duty of care was owed to them. The question was whether a person convicted of a crime was entitled to be indemnified against the consequences of that crime. Woolf J. held that the action would be dismissed on two grounds. First, the damages were too remote to be recoverable and, if such actions were to be allowed, it would leave insurers open to indefinite liability for an indefinite duration. Secondly, as a matter of policy, defendants should not have a right to be indemnified against the consequences of their crimes. In ''Clunis v Camden and Islington Health Authority'' (1998) QB 978 the claimant had been discharged from hospital where he had been detained under s3 Mental Health Act 1983. He was to receive aftercare services in the community under s117 Act 1983, but his mental condition deteriorated and, two months later, he fatally stabbed a stranger at a London Underground station. He pleaded guilty to [[manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]] on the ground of [[diminished responsibility in English law|diminished responsibility]] and was ordered to be detained in a secure hospital. Subsequently, he brought an action against his local health authority for negligence. The health authority applied to strike out the claim as disclosing no cause of action on two grounds. First, that the claim arose out of the health authority's statutory obligations under s117 Act 1983 and those obligations did not give rise to a common law duty of care. Secondly, that the claim was based on the plaintiff's own criminal act. In the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], the health authority's appeal was allowed on both grounds.

==The factual test of causation==
The basic test for establishing causation is the "but-for" test in which the defendant will be liable only if the claimant’s damage would not have occurred "but for" his negligence. Alternatively, the defendant will not be liable if the damage would, or could on the [[balance of probabilities]], have occurred anyway, regardless of his or her negligence. To understand this, a distinction has to be made between cause and a precondition for the events. Lord Hoffmann in ''[[South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;''(SAAMCO)'' [1997] AC 191, 214&lt;/ref&gt; gave a classic example.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A mountaineer about to undertake a difficult climb is concerned about the fitness of his knee. He goes to a doctor who negligently makes a superficial examination and pronounces the knee fit. The climber goes on the expedition, which he would not have undertaken if the doctor had told him the true state of his knee. He suffers an injury which is an entirely foreseeable consequence of mountaineering but has nothing to do with his knee."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The doctor's negligence does result in the mountaineer running a risk which he otherwise would not have done, but this is insufficient to incur liability. The purpose of the doctor's duty to take care is to protect the mountaineer against injuries caused by the failure of the knee, not rock falls. Even though the injury might be reasonably foreseeable, the doctor is not liable. In ''The Empire Jamaica'' (1955) 1 AER 452, the owners sent their ship to sea without properly licensed officers. The pilot fell asleep, and a collision occurred. Though the pilot was negligent at the time, he was generally competent. Thus the question for the courts was: were the owners liable for the collision because they sent their ship to sea without properly licensed officers? Or was the factual precondition superseded by the question as to the competence of the pilot? There is no question that sending the ship to sea is "a cause" of the collision. The legal question is whether it is "the cause". This is a question that the courts treat as objective, addressed by evidence and argument. [[H. L. A. Hart|Hart]] and [[Tony Honoré|Honoré]] (1985) describe the process for establishing legal causation as constructing a parallel series of events (counterfactual situation), and comment: "the parallel series is constructed by asking what the course of events would have been had the defendant acted lawfully." Thus, the owners were not liable. Although they sent the ship to sea without licensed officers (what actually transpired) rather than with licensed officers (the lawful course), the cause of collision was failing to navigate a safe passage. As to the pilot, his lack of licence did not bear on his general competence. The significant factor was the pilot's negligence at the time, and the pilot's lack of license made no difference there. Had the pilot been licensed, he would have been no less likely to sleep. The license would not have awoken him. The owners were, therefore, exonerated on grounds that whether or not the pilot held a license made no difference to the real cause, which was not the pilot's general level of competence, but rather his negligence at the time.

Similarly, in ''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2006/93.html Christopher Andrews v Barnett Waddingham LLP and RAJ Waddingham]'' (2006) EWCA Civ 93, the claimant transferred from a "safe" employer's pension scheme to a commercial scheme on the advice of a firm of financial advisers. The breach of duty alleged was confined to advice about the protection afforded by the Policyholders Protection Act 1975 to "with-profits" annuities, and this duty was found to be breached by the first instance judge. The claimant would not have chosen the Equitable Life with-profits annuity if he had been given correct advice, but that did not entitle him to recover the loss he had sustained as a result of his acquiring the annuity. The 1975 Act would have applied if Equitable Life had become insolvent. That was not the case. The real cause of the loss was that the terminal bonuses were not guaranteed and were adversely affected by the downturn in Equitable Life's fortunes. So the negligence as pleaded and as found by the judge did not relate to the fact that the terminal bonuses were not guaranteed.

In ''[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/25.html Pickford v Imperial Chemical Industries]''  (1998) 1 WLR 1189 the Lords were asked to determine the cause of [[repetitive strain injury]] in a typist. [[Johan Steyn, Baron Steyn|Lord Steyn]] posed the question, "That immediately raises the point that there must be an explanation for the fact that she contracted PDA4. What was the cause of her PDA4? There really was no alternative on the evidence to concluding that this condition was caused by Miss Pickford's typing work." But alternative explanations are that typing might aggravate an inherent condition or generally be an unsuitable occupation for someone with a predisposition to that condition, and neither proves the legal cause. In all cases, the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] is on the claimant to prove the cause as [[pleadings|pleaded]]. There is no burden on the defendant to prove an alternative explanation of the cause of any loss or damage, but a failure to do so may be a factor in deciding whether the claimant's explanation of the cause should be accepted. This test works well in straightforward situations, but it proves less successful in establishing causation in more complex situations where a number of actual or potential causes operate either consecutively or concurrently. For example, in ''[[Robinson v Post Office]]'' (1974) 1 WLR 1176 following an accident at work, the claimant had an anti-tetanus injection. Nine days later, there was an adverse reaction to the serum and brain damage resulted. No matter what tests the doctor might have performed, there would have been no sign of an adverse reaction within a reasonable time (see the [[Bolam Test]]). The doctor's reasonable decision to provide the standard treatment was therefore not the relevant cause of the brain damage because the claimant would not have been injected "but for" the defendant's negligence. Thus, in deciding between sequential contributions to the final result, the court must decide which is the more substantial contribution.

==Breaking the chain of causation==
{{main|Breaking the chain}}

===Acts of a third party===
Whether the acts of a third party break the chain of causation depends on whether the intervention was foreseeable. The general rule is that the original defendant will be held responsible for harm caused by a third party as a direct result of his or her negligence, provided it was a highly likely consequence. So, for example, where the defendant has control over the third party, or where the third party is faced with a dilemma created by the defendant, the chain of causation is unlikely to be broken and the defendant will normally be liable to the claimant for the damage caused: ''[[Home Office v. Dorset Yacht Co Ltd.]]'' [1970] AC 1004. The continuity of liability is not imposed merely because the original negligence makes damage by the third party foreseeable, but where the defendant’s negligence makes it very likely that the third party will cause damage to the claimant: ''[[Lamb v. Camden LBC]]'' [1981] QB 625. In practice, however, the requirement that the third party intervention will usually break the chain and, at the very least, the liability to pay compensation representing the totality of the loss or damage will be apportioned between the two or more tortfeasors. So, for example, if A injures V, it is foreseeable that an ambulance will be called, that paramedics will lift and carry V, and that there will be a journey back to the hospital. This cycle of intervention is continued in the hospital. None of this activity affecting V would arise "but for" the original negligence so A will remain liable unless and until either an unforeseeable B intervenes (e.g. negligently drives his car and collides with the ambulance), or a paramedic or member of the hospital staff is so seriously negligent that it becomes a new cause of action.

===Acts of the claimant===
{{main|Acts of the claimant}}

==Remoteness==
{{main|Remoteness in English law}}

==Loss of a chance== 
{{main|Loss of chance in English law}}
In loss of chance cases, the court is invited to assess hypothetical outcomes, either affecting the claimant or a third party where the defendant's negligence deprived the claimant of the opportunity to obtain a benefit or avoid a loss. Although it has been relatively unsuccessful in cases of medical negligence, it does provide a remedy in [[professional negligence]] generally.

==Loss of a right==
{{main|Loss of right in English law}}
Recent medical negligence cases suggest tacit recognition of a more rights-based approach to damage.

==Causation: law and science compared==

Science and law have different functions but share striking similarities. Both purport to provide rational, reasoned, independent, unbiased processes concerned with the objective assessment of evidence. There are also striking differences. Scientific assertions compared with determinations of legal causation have the following characteristics:
* they are population-based, not individual; general not particular;
* they are probabilistic, not deterministic;
* they are generally expressed as the refutation of the hypothesis and not a finding of fact or proof of an allegation;
* the evidence is not exhaustive, whereas an adjudication is determined according to the evidence available.
The major distinction between legal determinations and scientific assertions lies in the concept of certainty. The legal concept of causation is deterministic: it is an expression of the fiction of certainty, an absolute concept. The scientific concept of causation is probabilistic: it is an expression of the uncertainty of truth, an asymptotic concept.

[[Image:Uml diagram2.png|thumb|420px|Hierarchy of UML 2.5 Diagrams, shown as a class diagram. The individual classes are represented just with one compartment, but they often contain up to three compartments.]]In [[software engineering]], a '''class diagram''' in the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's [[class (computer science)|class]]es, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.

&lt;!-- Introduction --&gt;
The class diagram is the main building block of [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] modeling. It is used for general [[conceptual model]]ing of the systematic of the application, and for detailed modeling translating the models into [[programming code]]. Class diagrams can also be used for [[data modeling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sparks|first=Geoffrey|title=Database Modeling in UML|url=http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/archive.php?id=9| accessdate = 8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classes in a class diagram represent both the main elements, interactions in the application, and the classes to be programmed.

In the diagram, classes are represented with boxes that contain three compartments:
* The top compartment contains the name of the class. It is printed in bold and centered, and the first letter is capitalized.
* The middle compartment contains the attributes of the class. They are left-aligned and the first letter is lowercase.
* The bottom compartment contains the operations the class can execute. They are also left-aligned and the first letter is lowercase.
[[File:BankAccount1.svg|thumb|A class with three compartments.]]In the design of a system, a number of classes are identified and grouped together in a class diagram that helps to determine the static relations between them. With detailed modelling, the classes of the conceptual design are often split into a number of subclasses.

In order to further describe the behaviour of systems, these class diagrams can be complemented by a [[state diagram]] or [[UML state machine]].&lt;ref name="SWA09"&gt;[[Scott W. Ambler]] (2009) [http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/classDiagram.htm UML 2 Class Diagrams]. Webdoc 2003-2009. Accessed Dec 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
UML provides mechanisms to represent class members, such as attributes and methods, and additional information about them.

=== Visibility ===
To specify the visibility of a class member (i.e. any attribute or method), these notations must be placed before the member's name:&lt;ref name = "HOL07"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.holub.com/goodies/uml/ |publisher=Holub Associates |title=UML Reference Card, Version 2.1.2 |date=August 2007 |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{|class=wikitable&lt;beta &amp; entity&gt;&lt;&gt;

|style="width:3em;text-align:center"| &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; || Public
|-
|style="width:3em;text-align:center"| &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; || Private

|-
|style="width:3em;text-align:center"| &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; || Package
|}

=== Scope ===
The UML specifies two types of scope for members: ''instance'' and ''classifier'', and the latter is represented by &lt;u&gt;underlined names&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;ref name = "OMG00"&gt;[http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.3/Superstructure/PDF/ OMG Unified Modeling Language (OMG UML) Superstructure], Version 2.3: May 2010. Retrieved 23 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Classifier members''' are commonly recognized as “static” in many programming languages. The scope is the class itself.
** Attribute values are equal for all instances
** Method invocation does not affect the instance’s state
* '''Instance members''' are scoped to a specific instance.
** Attribute values may vary between instances
** Method invocation may affect the instance’s state (i.e. change instance’s attributes)

To indicate a classifier scope for a member, its name must be underlined. Otherwise, instance scope is assumed by default.

== Relationships ==
[[File:Uml class relation arrows en.svg.png|thumb|300x300px|UML relations notation]]
A relationship is a general term covering the specific types of logical connections found on class and object diagrams. UML defines the following relationships:

=== Instance-level relationships ===

==== Dependency ====
A ''[[dependency (UML)|dependency]]'' is a semantic connection between dependent and independent model elements.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler (2003) UML Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Standard Object Modeling Language&lt;/ref&gt; It exists between two elements if changes to the definition of one element (the server or target) may cause changes to the other (the client or source). This association is uni-directional.

==== Association ====
[[Image:UML role example.gif|400px|right|thumbnail|Class diagram example of association between two classes]]

An ''[[Association (object-oriented programming)|association]]'' represents a family of links. A binary association (with two ends) is normally represented as a line.  An association can link any number of classes.  An association with three links is called a ternary association.  An association can be named, and the ends of an association can be adorned with role names, ownership indicators, multiplicity, visibility, and other properties.&lt;br/&gt; There are four different types of association: bi-directional, uni-directional, aggregation (includes composition aggregation) and reflexive. Bi-directional and uni-directional associations are the most common ones.&lt;br/&gt; For instance, a flight class is associated with a plane class bi-directionally. Association represents the static relationship shared among the objects of two classes.

==== Aggregation ====
[[Image:KP-UML-Aggregation-20060420.svg|300px|right|thumbnail|Class diagram showing Aggregation between two classes. Here, a Professor 'has a' class to teach.]]

''[[Aggregation (object-oriented programming)|Aggregation]]'' is a variant of the "has a" association relationship; aggregation is more specific than association. It is an association that represents a part-whole or part-of relationship. As shown in the image, a Professor 'has a' class to teach. As a type of association, an aggregation can be named and have the same adornments that an association can. However, an aggregation may not involve more than two classes; it must be a binary association. Furthermore, there is hardly a difference between aggregations and associations during implementation, and the diagram may skip aggregation relations altogether.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/umlClassDiagrams.pdf UML Tutorial part 1: class diagrams]&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
''Aggregation'' can occur when a class is a collection or container of other classes, but the contained classes do not have a strong ''lifecycle dependency'' on the container. The contents of the container still exist when the container is destroyed.

In [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], it is graphically represented as a ''hollow'' [[rhombus|diamond shape]] on the containing class with a single line that connects it to the contained class. The aggregate is semantically an extended object that is treated as a unit in many operations, although physically it is made of several lesser objects.

Example: Library and Students. Here the student can exist without library, the relation between student and library is aggregation.

==== Composition ====
[[Image:AggregationAndComposition.svg|right|thumbnail|Two class diagrams.  The diagram on top shows Composition between two classes: A Car has exactly one Carburetor, and a Carburetor has at most one Car (Carburetors may exist as separate parts, detached from a specific car).  The diagram on bottom shows Aggregation between two classes: A Pond has zero or more Ducks, and a Duck has at most one Pond (at a time).]]

The UML representation  of a composition relationship shows composition as a ''filled'' diamond shape on the containing class end of the lines that connect contained class(es) to the containing class.

==== Differences between Composition and Aggregation ====

; Composition relationship
: 1. When attempting to represent real-world whole-part relationships, e.g. an engine is a part of a car.
: 2. When the container is destroyed, the contents are also destroyed, e.g. a university and its departments. 

; Aggregation relationship
: 1. When representing a software or database relationship, e.g. car model engine ENG01 is part of a car model CM01, as the engine, ENG01, may be also part of a different car model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodwin|first1=David|title=Modelling and Simulation, p. 26|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/condensedmatt/imr_cdt/students/david_goodwin/teaching/modelling/l3_objectorientation.pdf|website=The University of Warwick|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: 2. When the container is destroyed, the contents are usually not destroyed, e.g. a professor has students, when the professor dies the students don't die along with him or her.

Thus the aggregation relationship is often "catalog" containment to distinguish it from composition's "physical" containment.

=== Class-level relationships ===

==== Generalization/Inheritance ====
[[File:KP-UML-Generalization-20060325.svg|thumb|300px|Class diagram showing generalization between the superclass ''Person'' and the two subclasses ''Student'' and ''Professor'']]
It indicates that one of the two related classes (the ''subclass'') is considered to be a specialized form of the other (the ''super type'') and the superclass is considered a Generalization of the subclass. In practice,  means that any instance of the subtype is also an instance of the superclass. An exemplary tree of generalizations of this form is found in [[biological classification]]: [[human]]s are a subclass of [[simian]], which is a subclass of [[mammal]], and so on. The relationship is most easily understood by the phrase 'an A is a B' (a human is a mammal, a mammal is an animal).

The UML graphical representation of a Generalization is a hollow [[triangle]] shape on the superclass end of the line (or tree of lines) that connects it to one or more subtypes.

The generalization relationship is also known as the ''[[inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]]'' or ''"is a"'' relationship.

The ''[[Superclass (computer science)|superclass]]'' (base class) in the generalization relationship is also known as the ''"parent"'', ''superclass'', ''base class'', or ''base type''.

The ''[[subtype]]'' in the specialization relationship is also known as the ''"child"'', ''subclass'', ''derived class'', ''derived type'', ''inheriting class'', or ''inheriting type''.

Note that this relationship bears no resemblance to the biological parent–child relationship: the use of these terms is extremely common, but can be misleading.

:A is a type of B
:For example, "an oak is a type of tree", "an automobile is a type of vehicle"

Generalization can only be shown on class diagrams and on [[use case diagram]]s.

==== Realization/Implementation ====
In UML modelling, a realization relationship is a relationship between two model elements, in which one model element (the client) realizes (implements or executes) the behavior that the other model element (the supplier) specifies.

The UML graphical representation of a Realization is a hollow triangle shape on the interface end of the ''dashed'' line (or tree of lines) that connects it to one or more implementers. A plain arrow head is used on the interface end of the dashed line that connects it to its users. In component diagrams, the ball-and-socket graphic convention is used (implementors expose a ball or lollipop, whereas users show a socket).
Realizations can only be shown on class or component diagrams.
A realization is a relationship between classes, interfaces, components and packages that connects a client element with a supplier element. A realization relationship between classes/components and interfaces shows that the class/component realizes the operations offered by the interface.
           symbolic of realization                   --------▻

=== General relationship ===
[[Image:Class Dependency.png|305px|thumb|Class diagram showing dependency between "Car" class and "Wheel" class (An even clearer example would be "Car depends on Wheel", because Car already ''aggregates'' (and not just ''uses'') Wheel)]]

==== Dependency ====
[[Dependency (UML)|Dependency]] is a weaker form of bond that indicates that one class depends on another because it uses it at some point in time.
One class depends on another if the independent class is a parameter variable or local variable of a method of the dependent class. This is different from an association, where an attribute of the dependent class is an instance of the independent class. Sometimes the relationship between two classes is very weak. They are not implemented with
member variables at all. Rather they might be implemented as member function arguments.

=== Multiplicity ===
{{Anchor|multiplicity}}
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Unified Modeling == Nag == Language]] --&gt;
This association relationship indicates that (at least) one of the two related classes make reference to the other.  This relationship is usually described as "A has a B" (a mother cat has kittens, kittens have a mother cat).

The UML representation of an association is a line connecting the two associated classes. At each end of the line there is optional notation. For example, we can indicate, using an arrowhead that the pointy end is visible from the arrow tail. We can indicate ownership by the placement of a ball, the role the elements of that end play by supplying a name for the role, and the ''multiplicity'' of instances of that entity (the range of number of objects that participate in the association from the perspective of the other end).

|}

== Analysis stereotypes ==

[[Image:EntityControlBoundary Pattern.jpg|360px|right|thumbnail]]

=== Entities ===

Entity classes model long-lived information handled by the system, and sometimes the behavior associated with the information. They should not be identified as database tables or other data-stores.

They are drawn as circles with a short line attached to the bottom of the circle. Alternatively, they can be drawn as normal classes with the «entity» stereotype notation above the class name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3556">'''Daniela Bertol''' is an architect, designer and artist, working at the intersection between art and science. Her projects, based on a unified approach to knowledge, encompass several disciplines and media including [[astronomy]], [[land art]], [[geoglyph]]s, [[architecture]], [[design]], [[Digital data|digital]] models, [[photography]] and [[video]]. 
 
Daniela Bertol was born and grew up in [[Rome]], where she earned a master's degree in Architecture; in 1985 she moved to the United States.  Bertol's early projects explored geometric space and virtual environments using digital model, where geometric forms evolved in organic components, similar to shapes found in nature. Bertol founded ''space ink'' in 1989 as a multidisciplinary laboratory embracing experimentally built and published projects as well as theoretical works focusing on the transformation of architecture and its integration with digital space. The vision that technological advancements should establish continuity with the past—instead of creating a fracture—has been expressed in architectural and educational projects, art installations, artwork, furniture and graphic design.
 
Bertol's most recent project ---and work in progress--- is ''Sky Spirals'', a series of places devoted to sustainable design: the shaping of the landscape  based on interesecting spirals follow solar and celestial alignments . Sky Spirals began as a conceptual work based on digital models, maps and aerial photos. As the work developed, the virtual model and diagrams were translated to a real physical site in [[Claverack, New York]] (USA). They became ''[[Sun Farm]]'', the first site of the ''Sky Spirals'' concepts. The interest in sustainable architecture has inspired solar based design, such as the house at ''Sun Farm'': contemporary architectural vocabulary and materials re-propose design intention from early civilizations.

Bertol's design vision integrates principles of [[eastern philosophies]] and practices with contemporary architectural theories and research. [[File:Daniela bertol-urdhva dhanurasana.jpg|thumb|300px|Urdhva dhanurasana (wheel pose)]]

A lifelong [[yoga]] practitioner (and certified yoga teacher) she integrates spiritual practices in her artist and design work: several land art sculptures provide the path of walking meditations and yoga poses are included in the perception of architectural spaces.

Daniela Bertol is married with two daughters and lives in New York and Rome.

'''Effective Altruism Global''', abbreviated EA Global, is a series of [[philanthropy]] conferences that focuses on the [[effective altruism]] movement.&lt;ref name="cea1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Centre for Effective Altruism Announces Lineup for Effective Altruism Global 2015|url=http://www.pitchengine.com/pitches/00ffe1e9-9189-4dc8-9e7a-5595fb90f61b|website=Pitchengine|publisher=Centre for Effective Altruism|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conferences are run by the [[Centre for Effective Altruism]] at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name="aboutpage"&gt;{{cite web|title=About EA Global|url=http://eaglobal.org/about|website=EA Global|publisher=Centre for Effective Altruism|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Huffington Post]] editor [[Nico Pitney]] described the events as a gathering of "nerd altruists", which was "heavy on people from technology, science, and analytical disciplines".&lt;ref name="huffpo2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pitney|first1=Nico|title=Elon Musk To Address ‘Nerd Altruists’ At Google HQ|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elon-musk-google-effective-altruism_us_55a56626e4b04740a3de3130|accessdate=4 April 2016|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:AI Existential Risk panel at EA Global.jpg|thumb|Panel with [[Nick Bostrom]], [[Elon Musk]], Nate Soares, and [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] during EA Global 2015]]
An original Effective Altruism Summit was hosted in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exponentialtimes.net/videos/jaan-tallinns-keynote-effective-altruism-summit-2013|title = Jaan Tallinn's Keynote - Effective Altruism Summit 2013 |date = November 13, 2013|accessdate = April 11, 2015|publisher = Exponential Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, there were three main EA Global events. The largest was a three-day conference that took place on the [[Google]] campus in [[Mountain View, California]] with speakers including entrepreneur [[Elon Musk]], computer scientist [[Stuart J. Russell]], and Oxford philosophy professor [[William MacAskill]]. There were also conferences in [[Oxford]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. According to MacAskill, the nature of the conferences improved coordination and ideological diversity within effective altruism. Talks included subjects such as "global poverty, animal advocacy, cause prioritization research, and policy change". There were also workshops on choosing careers, Q&amp;A sessions, and panels on running local EA chapters.&lt;ref name="huffpo1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guan|first1=Melody Y.|title=Elon Musk, Superintelligence, and Maximizing Social Good: A Weekend at History’s Largest Gathering of "Effective Altruists"|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/melody-y-guan/elon-musk-superintelligen_b_7929960.html|accessdate=4 April 2016|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Google conference, a moderated panel featured [[Elon Musk]] with AI researchers on the topic of [[existential risk from artificial general intelligence]].&lt;ref name="inc"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Townsend|first1=Tess|title=Elon Musk: AI Is Going to Happen.

Russell|Stuart Russell]] stated that AI research should be about "building intelligent systems that benefit the human race".&lt;ref name="huffpo1" /&gt; [[Vox (website)|Vox]] writer [[Dylan Matthews]] criticized the event for its perceived focus on [[existential risk]], potentially at the expense of more mainstream causes like fighting [[extreme poverty]].&lt;ref name="matthews"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Matthews|first1=Dylan|title=I spent a weekend at Google talking with nerds about charity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45909">The '''fairness doctrine''' of the United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), introduced in 1949, was a policy that required the holders of [[broadcast license]]s both to present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that was—in the FCC's view—honest, equitable, and balanced. The FCC eliminated the policy in 1987 and removed the rule that implemented the policy from the ''Federal Register'' in August 2011.&lt;ref name="Finally"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boliek|first=Brooks|title=FCC finally kills off fairness doctrine|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/61851.html|work=Politico|date=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fairness doctrine had two basic elements: It required broadcasters to devote some of their airtime to discussing controversial matters of [[public interest]], and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. Stations were given wide latitude as to how to provide contrasting views: It could be done through news segments, public affairs shows, or editorials. The doctrine did not require equal time for opposing views but required that contrasting viewpoints be presented. The demise of this FCC rule has been considered by some to be a contributing factor for the rising level of [[Polarization (politics)|party polarization]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;E. Patterson, Thomas. "The News Media: Communicating Political Images." We the People. 10th ed. McGraw-Hill Education, 2013. 336. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rendall |first=Steve |title=The Fairness Doctrine: How We Lost it, and Why We Need it Back |publisher=Extra! |date=January 1, 2005 |url=http://fair.org/extra/the-fairness-doctrine/ |accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main agenda for the doctrine was to ensure that viewers were exposed to a diversity of viewpoints. In 1969 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] upheld the FCC's general ''right'' to enforce the fairness doctrine where channels were limited. But the courts did not rule that the FCC was ''obliged'' to do so.&lt;ref name=RedLion&gt;[http://www.epic.org/free_speech/red_lion.html ''Red Lion Broadcasting Co.'' v. ''FCC''], decided June 8, 1969, also at {{Ussc|395|367|1969}} (Excerpt from Majority Opinion, III A; Senate report cited in footnote 26). Justice [[William O. Douglas]] did not participate in the decision, but there were no concurring or dissenting opinions.&lt;/ref&gt; The courts reasoned that the scarcity of the broadcast spectrum, which limited the opportunity for access to the airwaves, created a need for the doctrine.

The fairness doctrine is not the same as the [[equal-time rule]]. The fairness doctrine deals with discussion of controversial issues, while the equal-time rule deals only with political candidates.

==Origins==
In 1938, a former Yankee Network employee named Lawrence J. Flynn challenged the license of John Shepard III's WAAB in Boston, and also lodged a complaint about WNAC. Flynn asserted that these stations were being used to air one-sided political viewpoints and broadcast attacks (including editorials) against local [and federal] politicians that Shepard opposed. The FCC requested that Shepard provide details about these programs, and to appease the commission, the Yankee Network agreed to drop the editorials.  But Flynn created a company called Mayflower Broadcasting and tried to get the FCC to award him WAAB's license; however, the FCC refused. Instead, in 1941, the commission made a ruling that came to be known as the Mayflower Decision which declared that radio stations, due to their public interest obligations, must remain neutral in matters of news and politics, and they were not allowed to give editorial support to any particular political position or candidate.

In 1949, the FCC’s Editorializing Report&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Commission in the Matter of Editorializing by Broadcast Licensees'', 13 F.C.C. 1246 [1949].&lt;/ref&gt; repealed the [[Mayflower Doctrine]], which had forbidden editorializing on the radio since 1941, and laid the foundation for the Fairness Doctrine by reaffirming the FCC's holding that licensees must not use their stations “for the private interest, whims or caprices [of licensees], but in a manner which will serve the community generally.”&lt;ref&gt;''Report ... Licensees'', 13 F.C.C. 1246, 1248-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = America's Battle for Media Democracy: The Triumph of Corporate Libertarianism and the Future of Media Reform|last = Pickard|first = Victor|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2015|isbn = 9781107694750|location = New York, NY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC Report established two forms of regulation on broadcasters: to provide adequate coverage of public issues, and to ensure that coverage fairly represented opposing views.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, D.L. (1996), ''The Federal Communications Commission, the broadcast industry, and the fairness doctrine 1981–1987'', New York: University Press of America, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The second rule required broadcasters to provide reply time to issue-oriented citizens. Broadcasters could therefore trigger Fairness Doctrine complaints without editorializing. The commission required neither of the Fairness Doctrine's obligations before 1949. Until then broadcasters had to satisfy only general “public interest” standards of the Communications Act.&lt;ref&gt;Donahue, H.(1988). ''The battle to control broadcast news''. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine remained a matter of general policy and was applied on a case-by-case basis until 1967,&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum Opinion and Order, 8 F.C.C.2d 721 (August 7, 1967), which codified the personal attack doctrine and implemented provisions with respect to political editorials from Times-Mirror Broadcasting Co., 40 F.C.C. 531, 538 (1962); codified as 32 Fed. Reg. 10303 at para. 4 (1967). This was amended twice in Memorandum Opinion and Order, 9 F.C.C.2d 539 (1967) and Memorandum Opinion and Order, 12 F.C.C.2d 250 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; when certain provisions of the doctrine were incorporated into FCC regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Donald P. Mullally, “The Fairness Doctrine: Benefits and Costs”, ''The Public Opinion Quarterly'' 33, no. 4 (Winter 1969–1970): 577.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1969 textbook case, the [[United States courts of appeals]], in an opinion written by [[Warren Burger]], directed the FCC to revoke Lamar Broadcasting's licence for television station [[WLBT]] due to the station's segregationist politics and ongoing censorship of NBC network news coverage of the US civil rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2008/3/6/the_fcc_censorship_legendary_media_activist The FCC &amp; Censorship: Legendary Media Activist [[Everett Parker]] on the Revocation of WLBT’s TV License in the 1960s for Shutting Out Voices of the Civil Rights Movement], [[Democracy Now]], March 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application of the doctrine by the FCC ==

In 1974, the Federal Communications Commission stated that the [[United States Congress|Congress]] had delegated it the power to mandate a system of “access, either free or paid, for person or groups wishing to express a viewpoint on a controversial public issue...” but that it had not yet exercised that power because licensed broadcasters had “voluntarily” complied with the “spirit” of the doctrine. It warned that: {{cquote|Should future experience indicate that the doctrine [of 'voluntary compliance'] is inadequate, either in its expectations or in its results, the Commission will have the opportunity—and the responsibility—for such further reassessment and action as would be mandated.&lt;ref&gt;''In the Matter of the Handling of Public Issues Under the Fairness Doctrine and the Public Interest Standards of the Communications Act'', 48 F.C.C.2d 1 (F.C.C. 1974); 39 Fed. Reg. 26.372, 26.374 (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;}}  

In one landmark case, the FCC argued that [[teletext]] was a new technology that created soaring demand for a limited resource, and thus could be exempt from the fairness doctrine. The Telecommunications Research and Action Center (TRAC) and [[Media Access Project]] (MAP) argued that teletext transmissions should be regulated like any other airwave technology, hence the Fairness Doctrine was applicable (and must be enforced by the FCC). In 1986, Judges [[Robert Bork]] and [[Antonin Scalia]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] concluded that the Fairness Doctrine did apply to teletext but that the FCC was not required to apply it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altlaw.org/v1/cases/419289 ''Telecommunications Research and Action Center'' v. ''FCC'', 801 F.2d 501 (D.C. Cir. 1986)] retrieved on August 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; In a 1987 case, ''[[Meredith Corporation|Meredith Corp.]] v. FCC'', two other judges on the same court declared that Congress did not mandate the doctrine and the FCC did not have to continue to enforce it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altlaw.org/v1/cases/421421 ''Meredith Corp.'' v. ''FCC'', 809 F.2d 863 (D.C. Cir. 1987)], February 10, 1987, retrieved on August 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decisions of the United States Supreme Court==

In ''[[Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC]]'', {{Ussc|395|367|1969}}, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld (by a vote of 8-0) the constitutionality of the fairness doctrine in a case of an on-air personal attack, in response to challenges that the doctrine violated the [[First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]. The case began when journalist [[Fred J. Cook]], after the publication of his ''Goldwater: Extremist of the Right'', was the topic of discussion by [[Billy James Hargis]] on his daily Christian Crusade radio broadcast on [[WGCB-TV|WGCB]] in [[Red Lion, Pennsylvania]]. Mr. Cook sued arguing that the fairness doctrine entitled him to free air time to respond to the personal attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Joyce: [http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:YDRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FAE0731EA2EE1CD&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&amp;req_dat=11ECDBF131F44C689BB0EDBA11D99EE0 “His call for a reply set up historic broadcast ruling; Fred J. Cook, whose book was attacked on Red Lion radio station WGCB in 1964, died recently at age 92.”] ''York Daily Record'' (Pennsylvania), May 6, 2003, retrieved on August 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Although similar laws are unconstitutional when applied to the press, the Court cited a [[United States Senate|Senate]] report (S. Rep. No. 562, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 8-9 [1959]) stating that radio stations could be regulated in this way because of the limited public airwaves at the time. Writing for the Court, Justice [[Byron White]] declared:{{cquote|A license permits broadcasting, but the licensee has no constitutional right to be the one who holds the license or to monopolize a radio frequency to the exclusion of his fellow citizens. There is nothing in the First Amendment which prevents the Government from requiring a licensee to share his frequency with others.... It is the right of the viewers and listeners, not the right of the broadcasters, which is paramount.&lt;ref name=RedLion /&gt;}}
The Court warned that if the doctrine ever restrained speech, then its constitutionality should be reconsidered.

However, in the case of ''[[Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo]]'', {{Ussc|418|241|1974}}, [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Warren Burger]] wrote (for a unanimous court):{{cquote|Government-enforced right of access inescapably dampens the vigor and limits the variety of public debate.}}
This decision differs from ''Red Lion'' v. ''FCC'' in that it applies to a newspaper, which, unlike a broadcaster, is unlicensed and can theoretically face an unlimited number of competitors.

In 1984, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress could not forbid editorials by non-profit stations that received grants from the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] (''FCC v. [[League of Women Voters]] of California'', {{Ussc|468|364|1984}}). The Court's 5-4 majority decision by [[William J. Brennan, Jr.]] stated that while many now considered that expanding sources of communication had made the fairness doctrine's limits unnecessary: {{cquote|We are not prepared, however, to reconsider our longstanding approach without some signal from Congress or the FCC that technological developments have advanced so far that some revision of the system of broadcast regulation may be required. (footnote 11)}}
After noting that the FCC was considering repealing the fairness doctrine rules on editorials and personal attacks out of fear that those rules might be "chilling speech", the Court added: {{cquote|Of course, the Commission may, in the exercise of its discretion, decide to modify or abandon these rules, and we express no view on the legality of either course. As we recognized in Red Lion, however, were it to be shown by the Commission that the fairness doctrine '[has] the net effect of reducing rather than enhancing' speech, we would then be forced to reconsider the constitutional basis of our decision in that case. (footnote 12)&lt;ref&gt;The quotation is from Section III C of ''Red Lion'' v. ''FCC'' {{Ussc|395|367|1969}}. Justice Brennan's opinion was joined by Justices [[Thurgood Marshall]], [[Harry Blackmun]], [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.|Lewis Powell]] and [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]. Dissenting opinions were written or joined by Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] and Justices [[William Rehnquist]], [[Byron White]] and [[John Paul Stevens]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Revocation ==
=== Basic doctrine ===
In 1985, under FCC Chairman [[Mark S. Fowler]], a communications attorney who had served on Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign staff in 1976 and 1980, the FCC released its report on ''General Fairness Doctrine Obligations''&lt;ref&gt;''General Fairness Doctrine Obligations of Broadcast Licensees'', Report, 50 Fed. Reg. 35418 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the doctrine hurt the public interest and violated [[free speech]] rights guaranteed by the [[First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|First Amendment]]. The Commission could not, however, come to a determination as to whether the doctrine had been enacted by Congress through its 1959 Amendment to Section 315 of the [[Communications Act of 1934|Communications Act]]. 

In response to the 1986 ''Telecommunications Research &amp; Action Center v. F.C.C.'' decision,&lt;ref&gt;801 F.2d 501 (D.C. Cir. 1986), ''reh'g denied'', 806 F.2d 1115 (D.C. Cir. 1986), ''cert. denied'', 107 S.Ct. 3196 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[99th Congress]] directed&lt;ref&gt;Making Continuing Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1987, P.L. 99-500. See also, ''Conference Report to Accompany H.J.Res. 738'', H.Rept. 99-1005. 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; the FCC to examine alternatives to the Fairness Doctrine and to submit a report to Congress on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40009.pdf | publisher=Congressional Research Service | date=13 July 2011 | accessdate=10 May 2016 |title=Fairness Doctrine: History and Constitutional Issues|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, in ''Meredith Corporation v. F.C.C.'' the case was returned to the FCC with a directive to consider whether the doctrine had been “self-generated pursuant to its general congressional authorization or specifically mandated by Congress.”&lt;ref&gt;809 F.2d 863 (D.C. Cir. 1987) at 872.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The FCC opened an inquiry inviting public comment on alternative means for administrating and enforcing the Fairness Doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''Inquiry into Section 73.1910 of the Commission’s Rules and Regulations Concerning Alternatives to the General Fairness Doctrine Obligations of Broadcast Licensees in MM Docket No. 97-26'', 2 FCC Rcd 1532 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in its 1987 report, the alternatives—including abandoning a case-by-case enforcement approach, replacing the doctrine with open access time for all members of the public, doing away with the [[personal attack rule]], and eliminating certain other aspects of the doctrine—were rejected by the FCC for various reasons.&lt;ref&gt;''In the Matter of Inquiry into Section 73.1910 of the Commission’s Rules and Regulations Concerning Alternatives to the General Fairness Doctrine Obligations of Broadcast Licensees''. 2 FCC Rcd 5272 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 5 August 1987, under FCC Chairman [[Dennis R. Patrick]], the FCC abolished the doctrine by a 4-0 vote, in the ''Syracuse Peace Council'' decision,&lt;ref&gt;''In re Complaint of Syracuse Peach Council against Television Station WTVH Syracuse, New York'', 2 FCC Rcd 5043 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; which was upheld by a panel of the Appeals Court for the D.C. Circuit in February 1989, though the Court stated in their decision that they made "that determination without reaching the constitutional issue."&lt;ref name="syacuse_fcc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://openjurist.org/867/f2d/654/syracuse-peace-council-v-federal-communications-commission | title=867 F. 2d 654 - Syracuse Peace Council v. Federal Communications Commission | publisher=Openjurist | date=10 February 1989 | accessdate=7 December 2014 | quote=Under the "fairness doctrine," the Federal Communications Commission has, as its 1985 Fairness Report explains, required broadcast media licensees (1) "to provide coverage of vitally important controversial issues of interest in the community served by the licensees" and (2) "to provide a reasonable opportunity for the presentation of contrasting viewpoints on such issues." Report Concerning General Fairness Doctrine Obligations of Broadcast Licensees, 102 F.C.C. 2d 143, 146 (1985). In adjudication of a complaint against Meredith Corporation, licensee of station [[WTVH]] in Syracuse, New York, the Commission concluded that the doctrine did not serve the public interest and was unconstitutional. Accordingly it refused to enforce the doctrine against Meredith. Although the Commission somewhat entangled its public interest and constitutional findings, we find that the Commission's public interest determination was an independent basis for its decision and was supported by the record. We uphold that determination without reaching the constitutional issue.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC suggested in ''Syracuse Peace Council'' that because of the many media voices in the marketplace, the doctrine be deemed unconstitutional, stating that: {{cquote|The intrusion by government into the content of programming occasioned by the enforcement of [the Fairness Doctrine] restricts the journalistic freedom of broadcasters ... [and] actually inhibits the presentation of controversial issues of public importance to the detriment of the public and the degradation of the editorial prerogative of broadcast journalists.}}

At the 4-0 vote, Chairman Patrick said:{{cquote|We seek to extend to the electronic press the same First Amendment guarantees that the print media have enjoyed since our country's inception.&lt;ref name="vote1987"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hershey, Jr. |first1=Robert D. |title=F.C.C.

[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/20/business/regulator-unregulated-dennis-patrick-fcc-another-man-who-loves-free-markets.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1987, Congress attempted to preempt the FCC decision and codify the Fairness Doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;The Fairness in Broadcasting Act of 1987, S. 742 &amp; H.R. 1934, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; but the legislation was vetoed by President [[Ronald Reagan]]. Another attempt to revive the doctrine in 1991 was stopped when President [[George H.W. Bush]] threatened another veto.&lt;ref&gt;Val E. Limburg, [http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/F/htmlF/fairnessdoct/fairnessdoct.htm "Fairness Doctrine"], April 27, 2009, [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fowler said in February 2009 that his work toward revoking the Fairness Doctrine under the Reagan Administration had been a matter of principle (his belief that the Doctrine impinged upon the First Amendment), not partisanship. Fowler described the White House staff raising concerns, at a time before the prominence of conservative talk radio and during the preeminence of the [[Big Three television networks]] and PBS in political discourse, that repealing the policy would be politically unwise. He described the staff's position as saying to Reagan: {{cquote|The only thing that really protects you from the savageness of the three networks{{mdash}}every day they would savage Ronald Reagan{{mdash}}is the Fairness Doctrine, and Fowler is proposing to repeal it!&lt;ref name="Fowler-Levin;"&gt;[http://citadelcc.vo.llnwd.net/o29/network/Levin/MP3/levin02162009.mp3 The Mark Levin Show], February 16, 2009 (a 26-Megabyte [[MP3]] file), from about 17 minutes 15 seconds into the broadcast to 25 min. 45 sec.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Corollary rules ===
Two corollary rules of the doctrine, the [[personal attack rule]] and the "political editorial" rule, remained in practice until 2000. The "personal attack" rule applied whenever a person (or small group) was subject to a personal attack during a broadcast. Stations had to notify such persons (or groups) within a week of the attack, send them transcripts of what was said and offer the opportunity to respond on-the-air. The "political editorial" rule applied when a station broadcast editorials endorsing or opposing candidates for public office, and stipulated that the unendorsed candidates be notified and allowed a reasonable opportunity to respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INFORMATION NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES: The policy and regulatory landscape|url=https://transition.fcc.gov/osp/inc-report/INoC-26-Broadcast.pdf|website=transition.fcc.gov|publisher=[[FCC]]|accessdate=22 August 2017|pages=277-278|format=pdf|date=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]] ordered the FCC to justify these corollary rules in light of the decision to repeal the Fairness Doctrine. The FCC did not provide prompt justification so both corollary rules were repealed in October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leweke|first1=Robert W.|title=Rules Without a Home: FCC Enforcement of the Personal Attack and Political Editorial Rules|journal=Communication Law and Policy|date=1 October 2001|volume=6|issue=4|pages=557–576|doi=10.1207/S15326926CLP0604_02|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15326926CLP0604_02|accessdate=22 August 2017|issn=1081-1680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former President [[Bill Clinton]] has also shown support for the Fairness Doctrine. During a February 13, 2009, appearance on the Mario Solis Marich radio show, Clinton said: {{cquote|Well, you either ought to have the Fairness Doctrine or we ought to have more balance on the other side, because essentially there's always been a lot of big money to support the right wing talk shows.}} 
Clinton cited the "blatant drumbeat" against the stimulus program from conservative talk radio, suggesting that it doesn't reflect economic reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Opposition ===
The Fairness Doctrine has been strongly opposed by prominent [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] who view it as an attack on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights and property rights. Editorials in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[The Washington Times]]'' in 2005 and 2008 said that Democratic attempts to bring back the Fairness Doctrine have been made largely in response to conservative [[talk radio]].&lt;ref&gt;

In 1987, Edward O. Fritts, president of the National Association of Broadcasters, in applauding President Reagan's veto of a bill intended to turn the doctrine into law, said that the doctrine is an infringement on free speech and intrudes on broadcasters' journalistic judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-06-21/news/mn-8908_1_fairness-doctrine

In 2007, Senator [[Norm Coleman]] (R-[[Minnesota|MN]]) proposed an amendment to a defense [[appropriations bill]] that forbade the FCC from "using any funds to adopt a fairness rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/07/14/2514/

In the same year, the Broadcaster Freedom Act of 2007 was proposed in the Senate by Senators Coleman with 35 co-sponsors (S.1748) and [[John Thune]] (R-SD) with 8 co-sponsors (S.1742)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-s1742/show Broadcaster Freedom Act of 2007], Open Congress Foundation, retrieved on November 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and in the House by Republican Representative [[Mike Pence]] (R-[[Indiana|IN]]) with 208 co-sponsors (H.R. 2905).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h2905/show Broadcaster Freedom Act of 2007, introduced February 1, 2005, "To prevent the Federal Communications Commission from repromulgating the fairness doctrine"], Open Congress Foundation, retrieved on November 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It provided that: {{cquote|The Commission shall not have the authority to prescribe any rule, regulation, policy, doctrine, standard, or other requirement that has the purpose or effect of reinstating or repromulgating (in whole or in part) the requirement that broadcasters present opposing viewpoints on controversial issues of public importance, commonly referred to as the `Fairness Doctrine', as repealed in General Fairness Doctrine Obligations of Broadcast Licensees, 50 Fed.

Neither of these measures came to the floor of either house.

On August 12, 2008, FCC Commissioner [[Robert M. McDowell]] stated that the reinstitution of the Fairness Doctrine could be intertwined with the debate over [[network neutrality]] (a proposal to classify network operators as [[common carrier]]s required to admit all Internet services, applications and devices on equal terms), presenting a potential danger that [[net neutrality]] and Fairness Doctrine advocates could try to expand content controls to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Poor, [http://www.businessandmedia.org/articles/2008/20080812160747.aspx "FCC Commissioner: Return of Fairness Doctrine Could Control Web Content"], August 13, 2008, Business &amp; Media Institute&lt;/ref&gt; It could also include "government dictating content policy".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eyeblast.tv/Public/Video.aspx?rsrcID=34016 See also [http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-288134A1.pdf Commissioner McDowell's speech to the Media Institute] in January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;     The conservative [[Media Research Center]]'s Culture &amp; Media Institute argued that the three main points supporting the Fairness Doctrine — media scarcity, liberal viewpoints being censored at a corporate level, and public interest — are all myths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultureandmedia.com/specialreports/2008/Fairness_Doctrine/CMI_FairnessDoctrine_Single.pdf Culture &amp; Media Institute report on The Fairness Doctrine.] - accessed August 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, [[Barack Obama]]'s press secretary wrote that Obama (then a Democratic U.S. Senator from Illinois and candidate for President): {{cquote|Does not support reimposing the Fairness Doctrine on broadcasters ... [and] considers this debate to be a distraction from the conversation we should be having about opening up the airwaves and modern communications to as many diverse viewpoints as possible. That is why Sen. Obama supports media-ownership caps, [[network neutrality]], [[public broadcasting]], as well as increasing minority ownership of broadcasting and print outlets.&lt;ref&gt;John Eggerton, [http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6573406.html "Obama Does Not Support Return of Fairness Doctrine"], ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]'', June 25, 2008, retrieved on October 30, 2008, citing an e-mail from Obama's press secretary, Michael Ortiz.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On February 16, 2009, Mark Fowler said: {{cquote|I believe as President Reagan did, that the electronic press{{mdash}}and you're included in that{{mdash}}the press that uses air and electrons, should be and must be as free from government control as the press that uses paper and ink, ''Period''.&lt;ref name="Fowler-Levin;"/&gt;}}

In February 2009, a White House spokesperson said that President Obama continued to oppose the revival of the Doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=White House: Obama Opposes 'Fairness Doctrine' Revival |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/02/18/white-house-opposes-fairness-doctrine/ |work=Fox News |date=February 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[111th Congress]] (January 2009 to January 2011), the [[Broadcaster Freedom Act of 2009]] (S.34, S.62, H.R.226) was introduced to block reinstatement of the Doctrine.  On February 26, 2009, by a vote of 87-11, the Senate added that act as an amendment to the [[District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009]] (S.160),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate Backs Amendment to Prevent Fairness Doctrine Revival |work=FOXNews.com |date=February 26, 2009 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/02/26/demint-tries-prevent-fairness-doctrine-revival/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228062416/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/02/26/demint-tries-prevent-fairness-doctrine-revival/ |archivedate=February 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [a bill which later passed the Senate 61-37, but not the House of Representatives].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/26/senate-votes-give-dc-full-house-vote/|title=Senate votes to give D.C. full House vote|last=Warren|first=Timothy|date=February 26, 2009|publisher=[[The Washington Times]]|accessdate=February 26, 2009}} The Senate roll call is [https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00073 here].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]] reported that the vote on the Fairness Doctrine [[rider (legislation)|rider]] was: {{cquote|In part a response to conservative radio talk show hosts who feared that Democrats would try to revive the policy to ensure liberal opinions got equal time.}}
The AP report went on to say that President Obama had no intention of reimposing the doctrine, but Republicans (led by Sen. [[Jim DeMint]], R-[[South Carolina|SC]]) wanted more in the way of a guarantee that the doctrine would not be reimposed.&lt;ref&gt;Senate bars FCC from revisiting Fairness Doctrine The Associated Press, February 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suggested alternatives===

{{distinguish|Unfairness doctrine}}

Media reform organizations such as [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]] feel that a return to the Fairness Doctrine is not as important as setting stronger station ownership caps and stronger "public interest" standards enforcement (with funding from fines given to [[public broadcasting]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepress.net/files/talk_radio.pdf|title="The Structural Imbalance of Talk Radio", Free Press, Center for American Progress|author=|date=|website=freepress.net|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Accurate labeling rules ====
Under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, the FTC requires that all 'consumer commodities' bear a label with an accurate 'statement identifying the commodity'.  If revenue-generating commercial broadcasts (whether by radio, tv, or internet) are a 'consumer commodity', then they must be accurately labeled.  That would seem to preclude 'News' that is not genuine, 'Opinion' that is not the author's actual opinion, or 'Analysis' that is not at least arguably analytical.  Note that in general the FTC only has authority over commercial aspects (pertaining to revenue) rather than speech.

===Public opinion===
In an August 13, 2008 telephone poll released by [[Rasmussen Reports]], 47% of 1,000 likely voters supported a government requirement that broadcasters offer equal amounts of liberal and conservative commentary, while 39% opposed such a requirement. In the same poll, 57% opposed and 31% favored requiring Internet [[website]]s and [[blog]]gers that offer political commentary to present opposing points of view. By a margin of 71%-20% the respondents agreed that it is "possible for just about any political view to be heard in today’s media" (including the Internet, newspapers, [[cable TV]] and [[satellite radio]]), but only half the sample said they had followed recent news stories about the Fairness Doctrine closely. (The [[margin of error]] was 3%, with a 95% confidence interval.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/47_favor_government_mandated_political_balance_on_radio_tv 47% Favor Government Mandated Political Balance on Radio, TV], Rasmussen Reports press release, Thursday, August 14, 2008 and [http://rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/pt_survey_toplines/august_2008/toplines_fairness_doctrine_august_13_2008 Toplines - Fairness Doctrine - August 13, 2008] (Questions and answers from the survey).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal revocation==
In June 2011, the Chairman and a subcommittee chairman of the [[House Energy and Commerce Committee]], both Republicans, said that the FCC, in response to their requests, had set a target date of August 2011 for removing the Fairness Doctrine and other "outdated" regulations from the FCC's rulebook.&lt;ref&gt;Gautham Nagesh, [http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/168807-fcc-sets-august-target-for-striking-fairness-doctrine FCC sets August target for striking Fairness Doctrine], "Hillicon Valley" blog, ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', June 28, 2011, quoting Republican Representatives [[Fred Upton]] (R-Michigan), Chairman of the Energy &amp; Commerce Committee, and [[Greg Walden]] (R-Oregon), Chairman of its Telecommunications Subcommittee.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, 2011, the FCC voted to remove the rule that implemented the Fairness Doctrine, along with more than 80 other rules and regulations, from the ''[[Federal Register]]'' following an executive order by President Obama directing a "government-wide review of regulations already on the books" to eliminate unnecessary regulations.&lt;ref name="Finally"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10191">In [[psychology]], a [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristic]] is an easy-to-compute procedure or "rule of thumb" that people use when forming beliefs, judgments or decisions. The '''familiarity heuristic''' was developed based on the discovery of the [[availability heuristic]] by psychologists [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]]; it happens when the familiar is favored over novel places, people, or things. The familiarity heuristic can be applied to various situations that individuals experience in day-to-day life. When these situations appear similar to previous situations, especially if the individuals are experiencing a high [[cognitive load]], they may regress to the state of mind in which they have felt or behaved before. This heuristic is useful in most situations and can be applied to many fields of knowledge; however, there are both positives and negatives to this heuristic as well.

==Origin==

===Availability heuristic===
The familiarity heuristic stems from the [[availability heuristic]], which was studied by [[Amos Tversky|Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]]. The availability heuristic suggests that the likelihood of events is estimated based on how many examples of such events come to mind. Thus the familiarity heuristic shows how "bias of availability is related to the ease of recall."&lt;ref name="cognition"&gt;Ashcraft, M.H. (2006). ''Cognition''. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey; Pearson Education Inc. {{ISBN|013198229X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tversky and Kahneman created an experiment in order to test this heuristic. They devised four lists of 39 names. Each list contained 19 female names and 20 male names. Half of the lists had famous female names, and the other half had famous male names. They showed the lists to two test groups. The first group was shown a list and asked to recall as many names as possible. The second group was shown a list and asked to determine if there were more female or more male names. The subjects who heard the list with famous female names said there were more female names than there were male names. Similarly, the subjects who heard the list with famous male names recalled more male names than female names. Thus the familiarity heuristic is defined as "judging events as more frequent or important because they are more familiar in memory."&lt;ref name="cognition"/&gt;

The familiarity heuristic is based on using [[schema (psychology)|schemas]] or past actions as a [[scaffold]] for behavior in a new (yet familiar) situation. This is useful because it saves time for the subject who is trying to figure out the appropriate behavior for a situation they have experienced before. Individuals automatically assume that their previous behavior will yield the same results when a similar situation arises. This technique is typically useful. However, certain behaviors can be inappropriate when the situation is different from the time before.

===Hindsight bias===
The [[hindsight bias]] is the inclination to see events that have already occurred as being more predictable than they were before they took place. For example, after a situation occurs for the first time, you begin to notice it when it reoccurs and therefore because you have now experienced it, it's more readily available in your consciousness and you pull information and predict aspects of the future because of this and think that you "knew it all along." "Hindsight bias results from a biased reconstruction of the original memory trace, using the outcome as a cue"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011|title= Hindsight bias from 3 to 95 years of age|journal= Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume= 37|issue=2|pages= 378–391|pmid=21299327|doi=10.1037/a0021971|pmc=3084020|author1= Bernstein|first1= D. M.|last2= Erdfelder|first2= E|last3= Meltzoff|first3= A. N.|last4= Peria|first4= W|last5= Loftus|first5= G. R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hindsight bias can alter memories and therefore future predictions.

==Important research==
Recent studies have used functional magnetic resonance imaging ([[fMRI]]) to demonstrate that people use different areas of the brain when reasoning about familiar and unfamiliar situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2004|title=The Hippocampal System Mediates Logical Reasoning about Familiar Spatial Environments|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience| volume =16 |issue= 4 |pages= 654–664|doi=10.1162/089892904323057362|pmid=15165354|author1=Goel|first1=V|last2=Makale|first2=M|last3=Grafman|first3=J}}&lt;/ref&gt; This holds true over different kinds of reasoning problems. Familiar situations are processed in a system involving the frontal and temporal lobes whereas unfamiliar situations are processed in the frontal and parietal lobes. These two similar but dissociated processes provide a biological explanation for the differences between heuristic reasoning and formal logic.

===Warm glow heuristic===
Corneille, Monin &amp; Pleyers (2004) showed that familiarity of human faces is based on attractiveness. In this study the researchers showed their subjects pictures of faces. The subjects were asked to rate how familiar the face was or was not using visual cues. The visual cues were choosing a picture of a butterfly (attractive) when the subject thought the face was familiar, and choosing a picture of a rat (unattractive) when the subject did not find the face familiar. The result of this study was that the subjects were more familiar when the face was attractive regardless of prior exposure to the picture (or person) itself.&lt;ref name=Corneille2004/&gt; This has been referred to as the warm glow effect (Monin 2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.6.1035|pmid=14674812|title=The Warm Glow Heuristic: When Liking Leads to Familiarity|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=85|issue=6|pages=1035–48|year=2003|last1=Monin|first1=Benoît}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warm glow effect states that positive stimuli seem more familiar because of the positive emotions they evoke in us.&lt;ref name=Corneille2004&gt;{{cite journal|year=2004|title=Is positivity a cue or a response option? Warm glow vs evaluative matching in the familiarity for attractive and not-so-attractive faces|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume= 41|pages= 431–437|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2004.08.004|issue=4|last1=Corneille|first1=O.|last2=Monin|first2=B.|last3=Pleyers|first3=G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The familiarity heuristic increases the likelihood that customers will repeatedly buy products of the same brand. This concept is known as brand familiarity in [[consumer behavior]]. Due to the familiarity heuristic, the customers have the rule of thumb that their past behavior of buying this specific brand's product was most likely correct and should be repeated. A study examining the choice of various models of microwave ovens based on the subjects' familiarity with them showed that high familiarity with the features of microwave ovens allowed for a faster and more confident choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1981|title=Familiarity and its impact on consumer decision biases and heuristics|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume= 8|pages= 223–230|doi=10.1086/208859|issue=2|last1=Park|first1=C. Whan|last2=Lessig|first2=V. Parker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect can also have important implications for medical decision making. Lay people tend to make health decisions that are based on familiarity and availability as opposed to factual knowledge about diseases. This means that they are more likely to take actions and pursue treatment options that have worked in the past, whether they are effective in the current situation or not. This also extends to treatments the patient has not used before but is familiar with. For example, a lay person may request a name-brand medication because they have heard of it before, even though a generic drug may be essentially the same but less expensive. Medical professionals are much more likely to use scientific facts to prescribe treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cytryn|first= K.N. |year=2001|title=Lay reasoning and decision-making related to health and illness|id=PhD Thesis, McGill University, Canada|url=http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=36903&amp;local_base=GEN01-MCG02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current criticisms==
There is some criticism of the concept of familiarity heuristic. It mainly focuses on the point that past behavior does influence present behavior but that this inherits from other, and differing contrivances. One study examining multiple possible mechanisms of how previous behavior influences the present found little support for the familiarity heuristic and tends to conclude instead that the influence of past behavior on a present one decreased when subjects were distracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2000|title=The cognitive impact of past behavior: influences on beliefs, attitudes, and future behavioral decisions|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume= 79|pages= 5–22|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.1.5|pmid=10909874|pmc=4807731|issue=1|author1=Albarracín|first1=D|last2=Wyer Jr|first2=R. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in order for a heuristic to be valid, its effect should be more prevalent when individuals are distracted and their cognitive capacity is highly strained. This result indicates that it is unlikely that a familiarity heuristic was applied during the experiment.

Another limit of familiarity heuristic according to a study by Ouellette &amp; Wood (1998) is that it might not always be applicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1998|title=Habit and intention in everyday life: the multiple processes by which past behavior predicts future behavior|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume= 124|pages= 54–74|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.1.54|last1=Ouellette|first1=Judith A.|last2=Wood|first2=Wendy}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study showed that the familiarity heuristic might only occur in situations where the target behavior is habitual and occurs in a stable context within the situation. Thus, the familiarity heuristic could be limited to habits and behaviors in routine situations.

==Family history representations==
Genealogical data can be represented in several formats, for example as a [[pedigree chart|pedigree]] or '''{{visible anchor|ancestry chart}}'''. Family trees are often presented with the oldest generations at the top and the newer generations at the bottom. An ancestry chart, which is a tree showing the ancestors of an individual, will more closely resemble a tree in shape, being wider at the top than the bottom. In some ancestry charts, an individual appears on the left and his or her ancestors appear to the right. A descendancy chart, which depicts all the descendants of an individual will be narrowest at the top.

Family trees can have many themes. One might encompass all direct descendants of a single figure, or all known ancestors of a living person. Another might include all members of a particular surname (e.g. male-line descendants). Yet another approach is to construct a tree including all holders of a certain office, such as [[Kings of Germany family tree|kings of Germany]]. This relies on [[Royal intermarriage|dynastic marriage]] to hold together the links between dynasties.

The image of the tree probably originated with one in medieval art of the [[Tree of Jesse]],&lt;ref&gt;Simon Julian Gilmour (2000) ''Daz Sint Noch Ungelogeniu Wort: A Literary and Linguistic Commentary on the Gurnemanz Episode in Book III of Wolfram's Parzival''. Universitätsverlag Winter, 2000. p.64&lt;/ref&gt; used to illustrate the [[Genealogy of Christ]] in terms of a prophecy of [[Isaiah]] (Isaiah 11:1). Possibly the first non-Biblical use, and the first to show full family relationships rather than a purely patrilineal scheme, was that involving family trees of the classical gods in [[Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Genealogia deorum gentilium]]'' ("On the Genealogy of the Gods of the Gentiles"), whose first version dates to 1360.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

===Fan chart===
One technique is a "fan chart", which features a half circle chart with concentric rings: the person of interest is the inner circle, the second circle is divided in two (each side is one parent), the third circle is divided in four, and so forth. Fan charts depict paternal and maternal ancestors.

==Graph theory==
While family trees are depicted as trees, family relations do not in general form a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] in the sense of [[graph theory]], since distant relatives can mate, so a person can have a common ancestor on their mother's and father's side. However, because a parent must be born before their child is born, a person cannot be their own ancestor, and thus there are no loops, so ancestry forms a [[directed acyclic graph]].

The graphs of [[matrilineal]] descent ("mother" relationships between women) and [[patrilineal]] descent ("father" relationships between men) are trees however.

Assuming no common ancestor, an ancestry chart is a [[perfect binary tree]], as each person has exactly one mother and one father, for two parents; these thus have a regular structure. A descendancy chart, on the other hand, does not in general have a regular structure, as a person can have any number of children, or none at all.

==Notable examples==
The longest family tree in the world [[Family tree of Confucius in the main line of descent|is that of]] the Chinese philosopher and educator [[Confucius]] (551–479 BC), and he is the descendant of [[Tang of Shang|King Tang]] (1675–1646 BC). The tree spans more than 80 generations from him, and includes more than 2 million members. An international effort involving more than 450 branches around the world was started in 1998 to retrace and revise this family tree. A new edition of the Confucius genealogy was printed in September 2009 by the [[Confucius Genealogy Compilation Committee]], to coincide with the 2560th anniversary of the birth of the Chinese thinker. This latest edition is expected to include some 1.3 million living members who are scattered around the world today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-02/16/content_6460522.htm Confucius family tree has two million members] from ''[[China Daily]]'', unknown date, updated February 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

There are extensive genealogies for the ruling dynasties of China, but these do not form a single, unified family tree; and it is unclear at which point(s) the most ancient historical figures named become mythological.

In Japan, the ancestry of the [[Imperial family of Japan|Imperial Family]] is traced back to the mythological origins of Japan.  The connection to persons from the established historical record begins in the mid-first millennium AD.

Another very old and extensive tree is that of the [[Lurie]] lineage—which includes [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Martin Buber]]—and traces back to Jehiel Lurie, a 13th-century rabbi in Brest-Litovsk, and from there to [[Rashi]] and purportedly back to the legendary [[King David]], as documented by Neil Rosenstein in his book ''The Lurie Legacy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Lurie Legacy: The House of Davidic Royal Descent |author=Neil Rosenstein, Ranan R. Lurie |isbn=978-1-886223-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1999 edition of the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' recorded the Lurie family in the "longest lineage" category as oldest-known living family in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=JTA |author=Bill Gladstone |date=October 24, 2004 |url=http://www.jta.org/2004/10/24/life-religion/features/the-oldest-family-in-the-world |title=The oldest family in the world}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Biblical genealogies of Jesus also claim descent from the House of David; covering a period of approximately 1000 years. 

In the Torah and Old Testament, genealogies are provided for many biblical persons, including a record of the descendants of Adam. 

According to the Torah, the [[Kohanim]] are decended from [[Aaron]].  Genetic testing performed at the [[Technion]] has shown that modern Kohanim share common Y-chromosome origins, although there is no complete family tree of the Kohanim.

In the Islamic world, claimed descent from the prophet [[Mohammed]] greatly enhanced the status of political and religious leaders.  New dynasties often used claims of such descent to help establish their legitimacy. 

In Europe, the pedigree of [[Niall Noígíallach]] would be a contender for the longest, through [[Conn of the Hundred Battles]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] 123 AD){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}; in the legendary history of Ireland he is further descended from [[Breogán]], and ultimately from Adam, through the sons of Noah.  Many noble and aristocratic families of European and West-Asian origin can reliably trace their ancestry back as far as the mid to late first millennium AD; some claiming undocumented descent from Classical Antiquity or mythological ancestors.

Before the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], in the [[Greco-Roman]] world, some reliable pedigrees dated back perhaps at least as far as the first half of the first millennium BC; with claimed or mythological origins reaching back further.  [[ancient rome|Roman]] clan and family lineages played an important part in the structure of their society, and were the basis of their intricate system of personal names.  However, there was a break in the continuity of records-keeping at the end of [[Classical Antiquity]].  Records of the lines of succession of the [[Pope]]s and the Eastern Roman Emperors through this transitional period have survived, but these are not continuous genealogical histories of single families.

In Africa, the ruling dynasty of Ethiopia claimed descent from [[King Solomon]] via the [[Queen of Sheba]].

The genealogy of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian ruling dynasties was recorded from the beginnings of the Pharaonic era circa 3000 BC, to the end of the [[Ptolomaic dynasty|Ptolomaic Kingdom]]; although this is not a record of one continuously-linked family lineage, and surviving records are incomplete.

In some pre-contact [[Native American civilizations]], genealogical records of ruling and priestly families were kept, some of which extended over at least several centuries. 

In many human cultures [[clan]] and [[tribal]] associations are based on claims of common ancestry; although detailed documentation of those origins is often very limited.

==Other uses==
The author [[Pete Frame]] is notable for having produced "family trees" of [[rock band]]s. In this instance, the entries represent membership of certain groups, and personnel changes within them, rather than family relationships. Several books have been produced with his family trees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Even-More-Rock-Family-Trees/dp/1844490076/ref=pd_sim_sbs_b_1|title=Amazon - Even More Rock Family trees|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn have led to a [[BBC]] television series about them, including interviews from the bands depicted in the trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0070y2d|title=BBC Four : Rock Family Trees|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gravi de pugna''''' is a [[pseudepigrapha|forged]]&lt;!--For the preference of this term over the more conventional ''[[pseudepigrapha]]'', see Bart Ehrman ''Forged''--&gt; letter written in the name of [[Augustine of Hippo]] which asserts that the morally superior side is always superior in battle and therefore that wars are proven to be [[just war]]s by their military success. The letter was widely accepted as authentic, and reassured soldiers that [[Gott mit uns|God was on their side]].

== Ideology ==
{{quotebox|width=25em|align=right|quote="You are concerned with whether you will prevail in battle: I don't wish you to doubt... when you are fighting God will look down from heaven, and discern which side is just and give that side the victory"|source=''Gravi de pugna'', translated by David A. Lenihan.{{sfn|Lenihan|1988|p=58-59}}}}

''Gravi de pugna'' is best known for its simple assertion that [[God in Christianity|God]] will assure that the morally superior side will win military battles,{{sfn|Lenihan|1988}}{{sfn|Russell|1977}} and conversely, that victory itself validates that the use of force was appropriate.{{sfn|Heyn|1997|p=19}}{{efn|This is a form of the [[just-world hypothesis]].}} Udo Heyn claims this was a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] notion,{{sfn|Heyn|1997|p=19}} and Phillip Wynn reports that it had long been believed in pagan antiquity by the time of this letter.{{sfn|Wynn|2013|p=302}} This understanding was, in fact, utterly rejected by Augustine.{{sfn|Wynn|2013|p=302}} Kelly DeVries regards the theology of ''Gravi de pugna'' as shallow and considers it to raise problems of [[theodicy]] and legitimacy as soon as the first Christian army loses.{{sfn|DeVries|1999|p=87}}

Gravi also urges prayer for victory before battle, which was also rejected by Augustine, who found such prayers inappropriate.{{sfn|Wynn|2013|p=302}}

== History ==
''Gravi de pugna'' was written in the fifth century.{{sfn|Heyn|1997|p=19}}
The letter was widely accepted as authentic from its introduction through the medieval era,{{sfn|Lenihan|1988}}{{sfn|Russell|1977}} and was the most frequently cited text in this period on holy war.{{sfn|Cowdrey|2003|p=178}} It was invoked to justify numerous wars, including by [[Hincmar of Reims]], [[Rabanus Maurus]], [[Sedulius Scottus]], [[Ivo of Chartres]], and [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]{{sfn|Russell|1977|p=29,37,38}} It was also recited at the [[Siege of Lisbon]] in {{CE|1147}}.{{sfn|DeVries|1999|p=87}}
''Gravi'' imbued the [[Crusaders]] with confidence that God was on their side, squelching all moral concerns and leading to behavior that did not comply with then-accepted [[rules of war]].{{sfn|Chan|2016|p=17}}

The work lost influence with the [[renaissance of the 12th century]], which developed more sophisticated [[jurisprudence]] and moral reasoning,{{sfn|Russell|1977|p=27}} At the same time, Augustine's own opinions, which had been largely unknown, were studied by the [[decretists]] and through them, [[Aquinas]] as well.{{sfn|Lenihan|1996|p=76-77}} The authenticity of ''Gravi de Pugna'' was not conclusively rejected until [[Erasmus]].{{sfn|Lenihan|1988|p=37-38}}
Although it is regarded by contemporary scholars as "obviously un-Augustinian",{{sfn|Lenihan|1988|p=59}}
it is now widely recognized that ''Gravi de pugna'' has inaccurately influenced scholars of Augustine's views on war even up through modern times.{{sfn|Lenihan|1988|p=38}}{{sfn|Cowdrey|2003|p=178}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27217">{{Other uses|Grievous Bodily Harm (disambiguation)}}

'''Grievous bodily harm''' (often abbreviated to '''GBH''') is a term used in [[English criminal law]] to describe the severest forms of [[assault]]. It refers to two offences that are respectively created by sections 18 and 20 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]. The distinction between these two sections is the requirement of [[intention (criminal law)|specific intent]] for section 18; the offence under section 18 is variously referred to as "wounding with intent" or "causing grievous bodily harm with [[specific intent|intent]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, paragraph 19-201 at page 1614&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the offence under section 20 is variously referred to as "unlawful wounding",&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, paragraph 19-201 at page 1614&lt;/ref&gt; "malicious wounding"&lt;ref&gt;The [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], section 29(1)(a)&lt;/ref&gt; or "inflicting grievous bodily harm".&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, paragraph 19-201 at page 1614&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statute==

===Section 18===
This section now reads:

{{Blockquote|Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously by any means whatsoever wound or cause any grievous bodily harm to any person,&amp;nbsp;... with intent,&amp;nbsp;... to do some&amp;nbsp;... grievous bodily harm to any person, or with intent to resist or prevent the lawful apprehension or detainer of any person, shall be guilty of felony, and being convicted thereof shall be liable&amp;nbsp;... to be kept in penal servitude for life&amp;nbsp;...}}

The words from "or shoot" to "some other", except the words "with intent to do some" were repealed by section 10(2) of, and Part III of Schedule 3 to, the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]].

==The offences==
None of the words used in these sections are defined elsewhere in the Act, but they have been defined by case law.

===Wound===

{{About|the legal definition of 'wound'|the medical definition|Wound|section=yes}}

For this purpose, a '''wound''' is an [[injury]] that breaks the continuity of the [[skin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Wm8DAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPA278,M1 ''Rex v Wood and M'Mahon''] (1830) 1 Mood CC 278; {{cite BAILII|court=EWHC |division=Exch |year=1834 |num=J79 |courtname=auto |litigants=Moriarty v Brookes}}; [[Carrington and Payne's Reports|C &amp; P]] 684; ''Rex v Beckett'' (1836) 1 Mood &amp; R 526; See also {{cite AustLII|NSWCCA|351|2003|litigants=R v Shepherd |date=28 November 2003 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There must be a division of the whole skin and not merely a division of the [[cuticle]] or upper layer.&lt;ref&gt;''Reg v M'Loughlin'' (1838) 8 C &amp; P 635; ''C (a minor) v Eisenhower'' [1984] QB 331 (1984) 78 Cr App R 48&lt;/ref&gt;

A single drop of blood is sufficient, but it must fall outside the body: see ''JJC (a minor) v. Eisenhower'' (1984) 78 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 48. In this case, a pellet gun was fired at the victim. The bullet ruptured blood vessels above his eye, causing his eye to fill with fluid. Lord Justice Robert Goff said the rupturing of blood vessels is an internal wound; only the breaking of whole skin would warrant a wounding charge.

A bruise or internal rupturing of blood vessels is not a wound,&lt;ref&gt;''C (a minor) v Eisenhower'' [1984] QB 331 (1984) 78 Cr App R 48&lt;/ref&gt; and neither is a broken bone.&lt;ref&gt;''Reg v M'Loughlin'' (1838) 8 C &amp; P 635&lt;/ref&gt;

Wounding does not imply the use of a weapon; a kick may be wounding.

'''Grievous bodily harm''' means "really serious bodily harm": ''DPP v Smith'' [1961] AC 290, HL; ''R v Cunningham'' [1982] AC 566, HL; ''R v Brown (A)'' [1994] 1 AC 212, HL; ''R v Brown and Stratton'' [1998] [[Criminal Law Review|Crim LR]] 485, CA. It encompasses a range of injuries: ''R v Woodland'' (2007) 48 MVR 360.

However, ''R v Saunders'' [1985] Crim LR 230, [1985] LS Gaz R 1005, allows "serious injury" as a sufficient direction to the [[jury]]. It is for the judge to decide whether the word "really" needs to be used in their direction to the jury: ''R v Janjua and Choudhury'' [1999] 1 Cr App R 91, The Times, 8 May 1998, CA (in this case, as a knife with a blade at least 5½ inches long had been used, it was not possible that something less than really serious harm was intended).

===Inflict and cause===
{{See also|Causation (law)}}

Where, shortly before the conclusion of a performance at a theatre, the defendant put out the lights on a staircase which a large number of persons had to descend in order to leave the theatre, and he also obstructed the exit by placing an iron bar across a doorway which they had in leaving to pass, and upon the lights being thus extinguished, a large proportion of the audience were seized by panic and rushed in fright down the staircase forcing those in front against the iron bar, he "inflicted" injuries which resulted by reason of the pressure and struggling of the crowd thus created on the staircase.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Martin'' (1881) 8 QBD [https://archive.org/stream/lawreportsqueen07unkngoog#page/n86/mode/1up 54]; (1881) 51 LJMC 36; (1881) 45 [[Law Times Reports|LT]] 444; (1881) 46 JP 228; (1881) 30 WR 106; (1881) 14 [[Cox's Criminal Cases|Cox CC]] 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Ormerod said that the effect of the decision in ''R v Gibbins and Proctor''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Gibbins and Proctor'' (1918) 13 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 134, (1918) 82 JP 287, [[Court of Criminal Appeal|CCA]]&lt;/ref&gt; appears to be that the offence of causing grievous bodily harm under section 18 can be committed by an omission.&lt;ref&gt;Ormerod, David. Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law. Thirteenth Edition. Oxford University Press. 2011. p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''R v Mandair'',&lt;ref&gt;[1994] 2 All ER 715, [1995] 1 AC 208, 99 Cr App R 250, [1994] 2 WLR 700, HL&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Mackay of Clashfern LC. said, with the agreement of the majority of the House of Lords, "In my opinion&amp;nbsp;... the word 'cause' is wider or at least not narrower than the word 'inflict'".&lt;ref&gt;''R v Mandair'' [1995] 1 AC 208 at 215, HL&lt;/ref&gt;

In [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/34.html ''R v Burstow, R v Ireland''],&lt;ref&gt;''R v Ireland, R v Burstow'' [1998] 1 Cr App Rep 177, [1997] 3 WLR 534, [1998] AC 147, [1997] 4 All ER 225, [[House of Lords|HL]] (24 July 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that an offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm under section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 can be committed where no physical violence is applied directly or indirectly to the body of the victim.&lt;ref&gt;This is the point of law that the Court of Appeal certified as being of general importance.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Hope of Craighead said "the word "inflict" implies that the consequence of the act is something which the victim is likely to find unpleasant or harmful." He said that, in the context of a criminal act, the words "cause" and "inflict" may be taken to be interchangeable.

Lord Steyn described the actions of Burstow as follows: "During an eight month period in 1995 covered by the indictment he continued his campaign of harassment. He made some silent telephone calls to her. He also made abusive calls to her. He distributed offensive cards in the street where she lived. He was frequently, and unnecessarily, at her home and place of work. He surreptitiously took photographs of the victim and her family. He sent her a note which was intended to be menacing, and was so understood."

Neither offence requires that a [[common assault]] be committed.

====1983 to 1997====
In ''R v Wilson, R v Jenkins'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Wilson, R v Jenkins'' [1984] AC 242, [1983] 3 WLR 686, 77 Cr App R 319, [1983] Crim LR 36, [[House of Lords|HL]], reversing [1983] 1 WLR 356&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Roskill said:
{{quote|In our opinion,  grievous bodily harm may be inflicted … either where the accused has directly and violently "inflicted" it by assaulting the victim, or where the accused has "inflicted" it by doing something, intentionally, which, although it is not itself a direct application of force  to the body of the victim, does directly result in force  being applied violently to the body of the victim, so that he suffers grievous bodily harm.}}

====Before 1983====
In ''R v Clarence'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23, (1888) 16 Cox CC 511, (1888) 5 TLR 61, (1888) 53 JP 149, CCR&lt;/ref&gt; it appeared that at a time when the prisoner knew, but his wife did not know, that he was suffering from [[Gonorrhea|gonorrhoea]], he had "connection" with her; that the result was that the disease was communicated to her, and that had she been aware of the prisoner's condition she would not have submitted to the intercourse.

Clarence's conviction under section 20 was quashed by the [[Court for Crown Cases Reserved]] by a majority of 9 to 4. [[Alfred Wills|Wills]],&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 36 to 37, CCR&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archibald Levin Smith|A L Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 37 to 38, CCR&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Fitzjames Stephen|Stephen]]&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 41 to 42, CCR&lt;/ref&gt; JJ. specifically said that they thought the disease had not been inflicted within the meaning of the word "inflict" in section 20. [[James Charles Mathew|Mathew J.]]&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 38, CCR&lt;/ref&gt; said that he agreed with Stephen. Stephen&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 46, CCR&lt;/ref&gt; said that he had been informed that [[William Grantham|Grantham J.]] agreed with him. [[John Walter Huddleston|Huddleston B.]]&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 56, CCR&lt;/ref&gt; said that he thoroughly agreed with Stephen. [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge CJ.]]&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 66, CCR&lt;/ref&gt; said that he agreed with all or almost all of what Wills and Stephen said. [[Henry Hawkins, 1st Baron Brampton|Hawkins J.]]&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 47 to 50, CCR&lt;/ref&gt; specifically said that he thought it had been inflicted within the meaning of the word "inflict" in section 20.

Wills J said (footnotes have been included in the body of the text, indicated by "(1)"):

{{Blockquote|But I think the section clearly points to the infliction of direct and intentional violence, whether with a weapon, or the fist, or the foot, or any other part of the person or in any other way not involving the use of the weapon, as for instance by creating a panic at a theatre whereby people trampled on one another: Reg. v. Martin. (1) 8 Q. B. D. 54 The prisoner in that case did what was certain to make people crush one another, perhaps to death, and the grievous bodily harm was as truly inficted by him as if he had hurled a stone at someone's head. Take also the illustration of my brother Stephen, of a man who digs a pit for another to fall into, whereby that other is injured. I do not think that this section was ever intended to apply to the administration of poison, and most of the arguments I have used to shew that sexual offences were not intended to be dealt with in s. 47 apply with equal force to s. 20. The Court for the consideration of Crown Cases Reserved in Reg. v. Taylor (1) Law Rep. 1 C. c. R. 194. decided that in the offence of "unlawfully and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm", an assault is necessarily included. So far as the decision is concerned, the same question may be said to arise under s. 20 as under s. 47. But I think the argument is even stronger here, for the context seems to me to shew that direct personal violence of some kind was intended, so that even if the constructive assault contended for by those who support a conviction under s. 47 were established, a conviction under this section would still be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 36 to 37, CCR&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stephen J said:

{{Blockquote|But is there an "infliction of bodily harm either with or without any weapon or instrument"? I think not for the following reasons.

The words appear to me to mean the direct causing of some grievous injury to the body itself with a weapon, as by a cut with a knife, or without a weapon, as by a blow with the fist, or by pushing a person down. Indeed, though the word "assault" is not used in the section, I think the words imply an assault and battery of which a wound or grievous bodily harm is the manifest immediate and obvious result.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 41, CCR&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A L Smith J. said "it appears to me that this offence cannot be committed unless an assault has in fact been committed, and indeed this has been so held".&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 37 to 38, CCR&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkins J. said that he thought that the contention that bodily harm cannot be legally said to be "inflicted" unless it has been brought about by some act amounting to an assault was untenable.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 47, CCR&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maliciously===
In [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1967/1.html ''R v Mowatt'']&lt;ref&gt;[1967] 3 WLR 1192, [1967] EWCA Crim 1, [1968] 1 QB 421, 51 Cr App Rep 402, 131 JP 463, [1969] 3 All ER 47&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Diplock]] said:

{{Cquote|In the offence under section 20 … the word "maliciously" does import upon the part of the person who unlawfully inflicts the wound or other grievous bodily harm an awareness that his act may have the consequence of causing some physical harm to some other person … It is quite unnecessary that the accused should have foreseen that his unlawful act might cause physical harm of the gravity described in the section, i.e. a wound or serious physical injury. It is enough that he should have foreseen that some physical harm to some person, albeit of a minor character, might result.}}

Therefore, the defendant must at least be reckless as to whether some harm, albeit not necessarily serious harm, is likely to be caused, (see [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/1.html ''R v Savage, DPP v Parmenter''],&lt;ref&gt;[1992] 1 AC 699, [1991] 3 WLR 914, [1991] 4 All ER 698, (1991) 94 Cr App R 193, [1992] Crim LR 288, [[House of Lords|HL]]&lt;/ref&gt;) but a mere intention to frighten is not enough (see ''R v Sullivan'').

In ''R v Sullivan'' [1981] Crim LR 46, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]], the appellant was tried on charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and inflicting grievous bodily harm. The victim said that the appellant and a companion were drunk. He said that while he was in a street that was eight feet wide and had a narrow pavement, the appellant drove a car through that street at twenty five to thirty miles an hour, mounted the pavement and injured him. The appellant denied that he was the driver of the car in a written statement to the police and said he could add nothing to that statement in an unsworn statement from the dock. However, during his closing speech, [[counsel for the defence]] suggested that all the appellant intended to do was frighten the victim and no more. The jury were directed that if there was an intention to frighten, and injury took place as a result, the appellant was guilty of an offence under section 20. The appellant was acquitted of the offence under section 18, but convicted of offences under section 20. The Court of Appeal held that an intention to frighten was not enough to constitute the necessary mens rea for section 20, and that the direction to the contrary effect was a misdirection. However, they dismissed the appellant's appeal. They said that a properly directed jury could not in the circumstances have come to any other conclusion than that the appellant must have been aware that what he was doing was likely to cause physical injury to the victim.

In practice, malice in the case of these offences means no more than foresight of the risk of bodily harm: ''R v Barnes'' [2005] 1 Cr App R 30.

===Specific intent===
{{Main article|Intention in English law}}

{{Cleanup rewrite|2=paragraph|date=August 2011}}
Section 18 has two separate ''[[mens rea]]'' requirements and is therefore an offence of specific rather than basic intent. ''R v Belfon'' [1976] 1 WLR 741, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]], confirmed that references to mere foresight or recklessness that harm was likely to result are sufficient for the element "unlawfully and maliciously inflict/cause" for the basic intent in both sections 18 and 20 but insufficient for the specific element. The intention either to cause or to resist arrest must be proved subjectively, say, in the charge "malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm".

The Crown Prosecution Service said that the following factors may indicate the specific intent: "a repeated or planned attack; deliberate selection of a weapon or adaptation of an article to cause injury, such as breaking a glass before an attack; making prior threats; and using an offensive weapon against, or kicking the victim's head".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/offences_against_the_person/#P242_19963|title=Offences against the Person, incorporating the Charging Standard|last=Crown Prosecution Service|first=|date=|website=www.cps.gov.uk|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative verdicts===
{{Rewrite section|date=August 2011}}
Sections 20 and 47 are offences of basic intent and can be an alternative charge to section 18, and/or section 47 is a [[lesser included offense|lesser included offence]].

===Consent===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
[[Consent (criminal law)|Consent]] is only an allowed defence to either section if there is considered to be a good reason. This may include medical operations, sport, [[body modification]]s (even if carried out by someone who is not trained),&lt;ref&gt;''R v Wilson (A)'' [1996] 2 Cr App R 241, [1996] 3 WLR 125, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]] (involved a husband branding his wife's buttocks)&lt;/ref&gt; and, occasionally, "[[wikt:horseplay|horseplay]]".&lt;ref&gt;''R v Aitken'' [1992] 1 WLR 1006, 95 Cr App R 304, [1992] 4 All ER 541, Ct-MAC (RAF officers set fire to one of their number inflicting severe burns)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[R v Brown]] (Anthony)''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/7.html R v Brown (Anthony)] [1993] 2 WLR 556, [[House of Lords|HL]]&lt;/ref&gt; however ruled that consensual [[sadomasochism]] is not legal.

==Mode of trial==

In England and Wales, the offence under section 18 is an [[indictable-only offence]].

In England and Wales, the offence under section 20 is [[hybrid offence|triable either way]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]] (c.43), section 17(1) and Schedule 1,  paragraph 5(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentence==

===Section 18===
In England and Wales, an offence under section 18 is punishable with [[Life imprisonment in England and Wales|imprisonment for life]] or for any shorter term.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (24 &amp; 25 Vict c 100), section 18; the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]] (11 &amp; 12 Geo 6 c 58), section 1(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern Ireland, an offence under section 18 is punishable with imprisonment for life or for any shorter term.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (24 &amp; 25 Vict c 100), section 18; the [[Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953]], section 1(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section 20===
In England and Wales, a person guilty of an offence under section 20 is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (24 &amp; 25 Vict c 100), section 20; the [[Penal Servitude Act 1891]] (54 &amp; 55 Vict c 69), section 1(1); the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]] (11 &amp; 12 Geo 6 c 58), section 1(1)&lt;/ref&gt; or on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the [[prescribed sum]], or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]] (c 43), section 32(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a person is convicted on indictment of an offence under section 20, other than an offence for which the sentence falls to be imposed under section 227 or 228 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], the court, if not precluded from sentencing an offender by its exercise of some other power, may impose a fine instead of or in addition to dealing with him in any other way in which the court has power to deal with him, subject however to any enactment requiring the offender to be dealt with in a particular way.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], section 163; this power was previously created by section 30(1) of the [[Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973]] and then by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/6/section/127 section 127] of the [[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An offence under section 20 is a specified offence for the purposes of chapter 5 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] because it is a specified violent offence.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], section 224(1) as read with section 224(3) and paragraph 7 Part 1 of Schedule 15 (where the offence is described as "malicious wounding")&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a serious offence for the purposes of that Chapter because it is not, apart from section 225, punishable in the case of a person aged 18 or over by imprisonment for life, or by imprisonment for a determinate period of ten years or more.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], section 224(2)&lt;/ref&gt; This means that sections 227 and 228 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] (which relate to extended sentences) apply where a person is convicted of an offence under section 20, committed after the commencement of section 227 or 228 (as the case may be) and the court considers that there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by the offender of further specified offences.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], sections 227(1) and 228(1)(a) and (b)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racially or religiously aggravated offence==

In England and Wales, section 29(1)(a) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] (c 37) creates the distinct offence of [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998#Racially or religiously aggravated offences|racially or religiously aggravated wounding or infliction of bodily harm]]. This is an aggravated version of the offence under section 20.

[[Encyclopedia]]s have progressed from the beginning of history in written form, through medieval and modern times in print, and most recently, displayed on computer and distributed via computer networks.

K&lt;
* Bulleted list item
&lt;/ref&gt;==Ancient times==
Encyclopedias have existed for around 2,000 years.

===Marcus Terentius Varro===
[[Marcus Terentius Varro]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɑr|k|ə|s|_|t|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|n|ʃ|ə|s|_|ˈ|v|æ|r|oʊ}}; 116 BC – 27 BC) was an [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] scholar and writer.

His ''Nine Books of Disciplines'' became a model for later [[encyclopedists]], especially [[Pliny the Elder]].  The most noteworthy portion of the ''Nine Books of Disciplines'' is its use of the [[liberal arts]] as organizing principles.&lt;ref name=Lindberg&gt;{{cite book |title=The Beginnings of Western Science |last=Lindberg |first=David |year=2007 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-48205-7 |page=137 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dPUBAkIm2lUC&amp;pg=PA137|accessdate=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Varro decided to focus on identifying nine of these arts: [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]], [[logic]], [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[astronomy]], [[musical theory]], [[medicine]], and [[architecture]].  Using Varro's list, subsequent writers defined the seven classical "liberal arts of the medieval schools".&lt;ref name=Lindberg/&gt;

===Pliny the Elder===
[[Image:naturalishistoria.jpg|thumb|''Naturalis Historiæ'', 1669 edition, title page]]
The earliest encyclopedic work to have survived to modern times is the ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman living in the [[1st century AD]]. He compiled a work of 37 chapters covering [[natural history]], architecture, medicine, [[geography]], geology, and all aspects of the world around him. He stated in the preface that he had compiled 20,000 facts from 2000 works by over 200 authors, and added many others from his own experience. The work was published around AD 77-79, although he probably never finished proofing the work before his death in the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79.&lt;ref name=naturalis&gt;Naturalis Historia&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My subject is a barren one – the world of nature, or in other words life; and that subject in its least elevated department, and employing either rustic terms or foreign, many barbarian words that actually have to be introduced with an apology. Moreover, the path is not a beaten highway of authorship, nor one in which the mind is eager to range: there is not one of us who has made the same venture, nor yet one Greek who has tackled single-handed all departments of the subject.&lt;ref name=naturalis/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also elaborates on the difficulties of writing such a work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a difficult task to give novelty to what is old, authority to what is new, brilliance to the common-place, light to the obscure, attraction to the stale, credibility to the doubtful, but nature to all things and all her properties to nature.&lt;ref name=naturalis/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This work became very popular in [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], and survived, with many copies being made and distributed in the western world. It was one of the first classical manuscripts to be printed in 1470, and has remained popular ever since as a source of information on the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] world, and especially [[Roman art]], [[Roman technology]] and [[Roman engineering]]. It is also a recognised source for [[medicine]], [[art]], [[mineralogy]], [[zoology]], [[botany]], [[geology]] and many other topics not discussed by other classical authors. Among many interesting entries are those for the [[elephant]] and the [[murex]] snail, the much sought-after source of [[Tyrian purple]] dye.&lt;ref name=naturalis/&gt;

Although his work has been criticized for the lack of candor in checking the "facts", some of his text has been confirmed by recent research, like the spectacular remains of Roman [[gold mines]] in [[Spain]], especially at [[Las Médulas]], which Pliny probably saw in operation while a [[Promagistrate|Procurator]] there a few years before he compiled the encyclopedia. Although many of the [[mining]] methods are now redundant, such as [[hushing]] and [[fire-setting]], it is Pliny who recorded them for posterity, thereby helping us understand their importance in a modern context. Pliny makes clear the fact in the preface to his work that he had checked his facts by reading and comparing the works of others, as well as referring to them by name. Many such books are now [[lost works]] and remembered only by his references, much like the lost sources mentioned in the work of [[Vitruvius]] a century earlier.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Middle Ages==
[[Image:Etymologiae Guntherus Ziner 1472.jpg|thumb|First printed edition of 1472 (by Guntherus Zainer, [[Augsburg]]), title page of book 14 (''de terra et partibus''), illustrated with a [[T and O map]].]]
The work ''De nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae'' ("About the wedding of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and Philologia") written by [[Martianus Capella]] (4th-5th century) was very influential on the successive medieval encyclopedias. It consists in a complete encyclopedia of classical erudition. It firstly introduced the division and classification of the seven [[liberal arts]] ([[trivium]] and [[quadrivium]]), followed by many successive works along the [[Middle Ages]].

The first Christian encyclopedia were the ''Institutiones divinarum et saecularium litterarum'' of [[Cassiodorus]] (543-560), which were divided in two parts: the first one dealt with Christian Divinity; the second one described the seven liberal arts.

Saint [[Isidore of Seville]], one of the greatest scholars of the early Middle Ages, is widely recognized as being the author of the first known encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' or ''Origines'' (around 630), in which he compiled a sizable portion of the learning available at his time, both ancient and modern. The encyclopedia has 448 chapters in 20 volumes, and is valuable because of the quotes and fragments of texts by other authors that would have been lost had they not been collected by Saint Isidore.

The most popular encyclopedia of the [[Carolingian]] Age was the ''De universo'' or ''De rerum naturis'' by [[Rabanus Maurus]], written about 830, which was based on ''Etymologiae''.

Many encyclopedic works were written during the [[12th century|12th]] and [[13th centuries]]. Among them, ''[[Hortus deliciarum]]'' (1167–1185) by [[Herrad of Landsberg]] which is thought to be the first encyclopedia written by a woman. ''[[De proprietatibus rerum]]'' by [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]] (1240) is often described as the most widely read and quoted encyclopedia in the [[High Middle Ages]]&lt;ref name="dotma"&gt;See "Encyclopedia" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Vincent of Beauvais]]'s ''[[Speculum Majus]]'' (1260) was the most ambitious encyclopedia in the [[Late medieval|late-medieval period]] at over 3 million words.&lt;ref name=dotma/&gt;

The first encyclopedias in vernacular languages were translations or abridgements of works in [[Latin]]. Among them, the most famous is ''Li livre dou Trésor'', written in [[French language|French]] by the [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Brunetto Latini]]. It is mainly based on the ''Speculum Majus''. The works by the [[Flemish]] [[Jacob van Maerlant]], as a whole, are regarded as an encyclopedia. These works, too, are based on former Latin texts.

=== Byzantine encyclopedias ===

[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] encyclopedias were compendia of information about both [[Ancient Greece|Ancient]] and Byzantine Greece. The first of them was the ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Bibliotheca]]'' written by the [[patriarch]] [[Photius]] (9th century).

The ''[[Suda]]'' or Souda (Greek: Σοῦδα) is a massive 10th century Byzantine encyclopedia of the ancient Mediterranean world, formerly attributed to an author called Suidas. It is an encyclopedic [[lexicon]], written in Greek, with 30,000 entries, many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost, and often derived from medieval Christian compilers.

===Arabic and Persian===
The [[Historiography of early Islam|early Muslim compilations of knowledge]] in the Middle Ages included many comprehensive works. Around year 960, the [[Brethren of Purity]] of [[Basra]]&lt;ref&gt;P.D. Wightman (1953), ''The Growth of Scientific Ideas''&lt;/ref&gt; were engaged in their [[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]. Notable works include [[Al-Razi|Abu Bakr al-Razi]]'s encyclopedia of science, the [[Mutazilite]] [[Al-Kindi]]'s prolific output of 270 books, and [[Ibn Sina]]'s medical encyclopedia, which was a standard reference work for centuries. Also notable are works of [[universal history]] (or sociology) from [[Asharite]]s, [[al-Tabri]], [[al-Masudi]], [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]]'s ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'', [[Ibn Rustah]], [[Ali ibn al-Athir|al-Athir]], and [[Ibn Khaldun]], whose [[Muqaddimah]] contains cautions regarding trust in written records that remain wholly applicable today.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

These scholars have influenced methods of research and editing, due in part to the Islamic practice of [[isnad]] which emphasized fidelity to written record, checking sources, and skeptical inquiry.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} An acquisition of knowledge it was believed not only enlightened the mind but also led to a greater appreciation of God. To be remarkable during these times was to keep pace with the ‘march of intellect’ and the printing press became a necessity for the widespread dissemination of this commodity called knowledge. As a means of cultural production, the printing press was the very embodiment of the ideal of ‘Enlightenment’.&lt;ref&gt;Nair, Savithri Preetha. "'...Of real use to the people': The Tanjore printing press and the spread of useful knowledge." Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===

[[Varāhamihira]]'s (505–587 CE) [[Brihat Samhita]] ("large compilation") is an encyclopedic work, not only dealing with astrology but also rainfall, clouds, water-divination, intentions and characteristics of animals, perfumes, erotic recipes, pimples, temples, architecture and other topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Varahamihira's Brihat Samhita|author=M. Ramakrishna Bhat|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|url=http://www.astroamerica.com/text/brihatsamhita.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{Main|Chinese encyclopedia}}
The enormous encyclopedic work in China of the ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]'', compiled by the 11th century during the early [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), was a massive literary undertaking for the time. The last encyclopedia of the four, the ''[[Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau]]'', amounted to 9.4 million [[Chinese characters]] in 1,000 written volumes. There were many great encyclopedists throughout Chinese history, including the scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095) with his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' of 1088, the statesman, inventor, and agronomist [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] (active 1290–1333) with his ''Nong Shu'' of 1313, and the written ''Tiangong Kaiwu'' of [[Song Yingxing]] (1587–1666), the latter of whom was termed the "[[Denis Diderot|Diderot of China]]" by British historian [[Joseph Needham]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 102"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yongle Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty]] oversaw the compilation of the ''[[Yongle Encyclopedia]]'', one of the largest encyclopedias in history, which was completed in 1408 and comprised over 370 million Chinese characters in 11,000 handwritten volumes, of which only about 400 remain today. In the succeeding [[Qing dynasty]], the [[Qianlong Emperor]] personally composed 40,000 poems as part of a 4.7 million page library in 4 divisions, including thousands of essays, called the ''[[Siku Quanshu]]'' which is probably the largest collection of books in the world. It is instructive to compare his title for this knowledge, ''Watching the waves in a Sacred Sea'' to a Western-style title for all knowledge. Encyclopedic works, both in imitation of Chinese encyclopedias and as independent works of their own origin, have been known to exist in Japan since the 9th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Renaissance==
[[File:Margarita Philosopica by Reisch 2.jpg|thumb|Anatomy in ''Margarita Philosophica'', 1565]]
These works were all hand copied and thus rarely available, beyond wealthy patrons or monastic men of learning: they were expensive, and usually written for those extending knowledge rather than those using it.&lt;ref name="dotma"/&gt;

During  the [[Renaissance]],  the creation of [[printing]] allowed a wider diffusion of encyclopedias and every scholar could have his or her own copy.

The ''De expetendis et fugiendis rebus'' by Giorgio Valla was posthumously printed in 1501 by [[Aldo Manuzio]] in [[Venice]]. This work followed the traditional scheme of liberal arts. However, Valla added the translation of ancient Greek works on mathematics (firstly by [[Archimedes]]), newly discovered and translated.

The ''Margarita Philosophica'' by [[Gregor Reisch]], printed in 1503, was a complete encyclopedia explaining the seven liberal arts.

Much encyclopaedism of the [[French Renaissance]] was based upon the notion of not including every fact known to humans, but only that knowledge that was necessary, where necessity was judged by a wide variety of criteria, leading to works of greatly varying sizes. [[Béroalde de Verville]] laid the foundation for his encyclopaedic works in a [[hexameral poem]] entitled ''Les cognoissances nécessaires'' for example. Often, the criteria had moral bases, such as in the case of [[Pierre de La Primaudaye]]'s ''L'Académie française'' and Guillaume Telin's ''Bref sommaire des sept vertus &amp;c.''. Encyclopaedists encountered several problems with this approach, including how to decide what to omit as unnecessary, how to structure knowledge that resisted structure (often simply as a consequence of the sheer amount of material that deserved inclusion), and how to cope with the influx of newly discovered knowledge and the effects that it had on prior structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Palace of Secrets: Beroalde de Verville and Renaissance Conceptions of Knowledge|author=Neil Kenny|pages=12–13|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-815862-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term encyclopaedia was coined by 15th century humanists who misread copies of their texts of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Quintilian]], and combined the two Greek words "''enkyklios paideia''" into one word. The phrase ''enkyklios paideia'' (ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία) was used by Plutarch and the Latin word Enciclopedia came from him.&lt;br&gt;The first work titled in this way was the ''Encyclopedia orbisque doctrinarum, hoc est omnium artium, scientiarum, ipsius philosophiae index ac divisio'' written by [[Johannes Aventinus]] in 1517.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The English physician and philosopher, Sir [[Thomas Browne]], specifically employed the word ''encyclopaedia'' for the first time in English{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} as early as 1646 in the preface to the reader to describe his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' or ''Vulgar Errors'', a series of refutations of common errors of his age. Browne structured his encyclopedia upon the time-honoured schemata of the Renaissance, the so-called 'scale of creation' which ascends a hierarchical ladder via the mineral, vegetable, animal, human, planetary and cosmological worlds. Browne's compendium went through no less than five editions, each revised and augmented, the last edition appearing in 1672. ''Pseudodoxia Epidemica'' found itself upon the bookshelves of many educated European readers, for throughout the late 17th century and early 18th century it was translated. For many years it was thought incompatible with the French and Dutcheze, into the French, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and German languages as well as [[Latin]].

==18th–19th centuries==
[[Image:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|''[[Encyclopédie]]'', 1773]]
The beginnings of the modern idea of the general-purpose, widely distributed printed encyclopedia precede the 18th century encyclopedists. However, [[Ephraim Chambers|Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' (1728), and the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of Diderot and D'Alembert (1751 onwards), as well as ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' and the ''[[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie|Conversations-Lexikon]]'', were the first to realize the form we would recognize today, with a comprehensive scope of topics, discussed in depth and organized in an accessible, systematic method. Chambers, in 1728, followed the earlier lead of John Harris's ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' of 1704 and later editions (see also below); this work was by its title and content "A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves".

[[Image:1708-harris-ttlpg.jpg|left|thumb|Harris' ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'', title page of 2nd edition, 1708]]

[[John Harris (writer)|John Harris]] is often credited with introducing the now-familiar alphabetic format in 1704 with his English ''Lexicon Technicum: Or, A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves'' – to give its full title. Organized alphabetically, its content does indeed contain explanation not merely of the terms used in the arts and sciences, but of the arts and sciences themselves. [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] contributed his only published work on chemistry to the second volume of 1710. Its emphasis was on science—and conformably to the broad 18th-century understanding of the term 'science', its content extends beyond what would be called science or technology today, and includes topics from the humanities and fine arts, e.g. a substantial number from law, commerce, music, and heraldry. At about 1,200 pages, its scope can be considered as more that of an [[encyclopedic dictionary]] than a true encyclopedia. Harris himself considered it a dictionary; the work is one of the first technical dictionaries in any language.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

[[Ephraim Chambers]] published his ''[[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopædia]]'' in 1728. It included a broad scope of subjects, used an alphabetic arrangement, relied on many different contributors and included the innovation of cross-referencing other sections within articles. Chambers has been referred to as the father of the modern encyclopedia for this two-volume work.

A French translation of Chambers' work inspired the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', perhaps the most famous early encyclopedia, notable for its scope, the quality of some contributions, and its political and cultural impact in the years leading up to the [[French Revolution]]. The ''Encyclopédie'' was edited by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] and [[Denis Diderot]] and published in 17 volumes of articles, issued from 1751 to 1765, and 11 volumes of illustrations, issued from 1762 to 1772. Five volumes of supplementary material and a two volume index, supervised by other editors, were issued from 1776 to 1780 by [[Charles-Joseph Panckoucke]].

The ''Encyclopédie'' represented the essence of the [[French Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Stephen J. Gendzier (1967), cited in Hillmelfarb 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot, in his [http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;idno=did2222.0000.004;rgn=main;view=text ''Encyclopédie'' article of the same name], went further: "to collect all the knowledge that now lies scattered over the face of the earth, to make known its general structure to the men among we live, and to transmit it to those who will come after us", to make men not only wiser but also "more virtuous and more happy."&lt;ref&gt;Denis Diderot, ''Rameau's Nephew and Other Works'', trans. and ed. Jacques Barzun and Ralph H. Bowen (1956), cited in Himmelfarb 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing the inherent problems with the model of knowledge he had created, Diderot's view of his own success in writing the ''Encyclopédie'' were far from ecstatic. Diderot envisioned the perfect encyclopedia as more than the sum of its parts. In his own article on the encyclopedia, Diderot also wrote, "Were an analytical dictionary of the sciences and arts nothing more than a methodical combination of their elements, I would still ask whom it behooves to fabricate good elements." Diderot viewed the ideal encyclopedia as an index of connections. He realized that all knowledge could never be amassed in just one large work, but he hoped the relations among the subjects could be.

The ''Encyclopédie'' in turn inspired the venerable ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', which had a modest beginning in Scotland: the first edition, issued between 1768 and 1771, had just three hastily completed volumes – A–B, C–L, and M–Z – with a total of 2,391 pages. By 1797, when the third edition was completed, it had been expanded to 18 volumes addressing a full range of topics, with articles contributed by a range of authorities on their subjects.

The German-language ''[[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie|Conversations-Lexikon]]'' was published at [[Leipzig]] from 1796 to 1808, in 6 volumes. Paralleling other 18th century encyclopedias, its scope was expanded beyond that of earlier publications, in an effort at comprehensiveness. It was, however, intended not for scholarly use but to provide results of research and discovery in a simple and popular form without extensive detail. This format, a contrast to the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', was widely imitated by later 19th century encyclopedias in Britain, the United States, France, Spain, Italy and other countries. Of the influential late-18th century and early-19th century encyclopedias, the ''Conversations-Lexikon'' is perhaps most similar in form to today's encyclopedias.

[[File:eclairage.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A typical custom-made encyclopedia engraving by [[Maurice Dessertenne]] for the ''Nouveau Larousse illustré'' (France, 1898–1907)]]
The early years of the 19th century saw a flowering of encyclopedia publishing in the United Kingdom, Europe and America. In England ''[[Rees's Cyclopædia]]'' (1802–19) contains an enormous amount in information about the industrial and scientific revolutions of the time. A feature of these publications is the high-quality illustrations made by engravers like [[Wilson Lowry]] of art work supplied by specialist draftsmen like [[John Farey, Jr.]] Encyclopedias were published in Scotland, as a result of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], for education there was of a higher standard than in the rest of the United Kingdom. The [[Bulgarian National Revival|National Revival]] of [[Bulgaria]], influenced by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], resulted in [[Petar Beron]]'s ''[[Primer with Various Instructions]]'' (also known as the ''Fish Primer'') in 1824. It was a small encyclopedia for children, containing fables, proverbs, ancient history, basic [[arithmetics]], [[zoology]] and [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bulgaria: historical and geographical outline|last=Todorov|first=Nikolai|year=1968|page=263|location=Sofia|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=fxidT834J_LZ4QTM7d2pDg&amp;hl=bg&amp;id=zXlpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=fish+primer+beron+bulgarian+encyclopedia+-april&amp;q=fish+primer+beron+encyclopedia+-april}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beron later published a 7-volume work in natural sciences known as ''[[Panepisteme]]'' in 1867.

The 17-volume ''[[Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle]]'' and its supplements were published in France by [[Pierre Larousse]] from 1866 to 1890.

''Encyclopædia Britannica'' appeared in various editions throughout the century, and the growth of [[popular education]] and the [[Mechanics' Institutes]], spearheaded by the [[Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]] led to the production of the ''[[Penny Cyclopaedia]]'', as its title suggests issued in weekly numbers at a penny each like a newspaper.

In the early 20th century, the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' reached its eleventh edition, and inexpensive encyclopedias such as ''[[Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia]]'' and ''[[Everyman's Encyclopaedia]]'' were common.

===International development===
During the 19th and early 20th century, many smaller or less developed languages saw their first encyclopedias, using French, German, and English role models. While encyclopedias in larger languages, having large markets that could support a large editorial staff, churned out new 20-volume works in a few years and new editions with brief intervals, such publication plans often spanned a decade or more in smaller languages.

The first large encyclopedia in Russian, ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]'' (86 volumes, 1890–1906), was a direct cooperation with the German Brockhaus.

Without such a formal cooperation, the Swedish ''Conversations-lexicon'' (4 volumes, 1821–1826) was a translation of Brockhaus 2nd edition. The first encyclopedia written originally in Swedish was ''Svenskt konversationslexikon'' (4 volumes, 1845–1851) by Per Gustaf Berg. A more ambitious project was ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'', established in 1875 and intended to comprise 6 volumes. But in 1885, when it had published 8 volumes and gotten only halfways (A–K), the publisher turned to the government for extra funding; encyclopedias had become national monuments. It was finished in 1894 with 18 volumes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfar/slutord.html Slutord], postscriptum to the 1st edition, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; with two supplement volumes (1896–1899).
[[File:Göttingen-SUB-Encyclopedia.Americana.JPG|thumb|180px|''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'' at Göttingen State and University Library.]]
The first major Danish encyclopedia was ''[[Salmonsens Konversationsleksikon]]'' (19 volumes, 1893–1911).

In Norway, encyclopedias follow the unique history of the [[Norwegian language]], the [[Bokmål]] variant having branched off from Danish during the 19th century. After the national independence in 1905, publisher [[Aschehoug]] (owned by [[William Martin Nygaard]]) hired librarian Haakon Nyhuus to edit ''Illustreret norsk konversationsleksikon'' (6 volumes, 1907–1913), in later editions known as ''Aschehougs konversasjonsleksikon''. In the [[Nynorsk]] variant of the language, ''Norsk Allkunnebok'' (10 volumes, 1948–1966) was the only encyclopedia until the arrival of Wikipedia.

The first major Finnish encyclopedia was ''[[Tietosanakirja]]'' (11 volumes, 1909–1922). Inspired by the minority language example of ''Norsk Allkunnebok'', a Swedish-language encyclopedia of Finland was initiated in 1969 and eventually published as ''[[Uppslagsverket Finland]]'' (3 volumes, 1982–1985; 2nd edition in 5 volumes, 2003–2007). With such a small market, the sales revenue only covered the printing cost, while editors were paid by endowments. In 2009 the entire contents was made available online, free of charge.

Already during [[czarist Russia]]n rule, two editions appeared of the Latvian ''Konversācijas vārdnīca'' (2 volumes, 1891–1893; 4 volumes, 1906–1921). The larger ''Latviešu konversācijas vārdnīca'' (21 volumes, A–Tjepolo, 1927–1940) was interrupted by World War II and never completed. After the war, Latvian emigrants in Sweden published ''Latvju enciklopēdija'' (3 volumes, 1950–1956, with a supplement volume in 1962). Soviet authories published ''Latvijas PSR mazās enciklopēdijas'' (3 volumes, 1967–1970) and ''Latvijas padomju enciklopēdija'' (10 volumes, 1981–1988).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historia.lv/encuklopedijas/manualo_enciklopediju_saraksts.htm List of Latvian encyclopedias] from the website Historia.lv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the history of [[Lithuanian encyclopedias]], the ''Lietuviškoji enciklopedija'' (9 volumes A–J, 1933–1941) was interrupted by World War II and never completed. Lithuanian emigrants in the United States published ''Lietuvių enciklopedija'' (35 volumes, 1953–1966). Soviet authorities published ''Mažoji lietuviškoji tarybinė enciklopedija'' (3 volumes, 1966–1971), ''Lietuviškoji tarybinė enciklopedija'' (12 volumes, 1976–1985), and ''[[Encyclopedia of Soviet Lithuania|Tarybų Lietuvos enciklopedija]]'' (4 volumes, 1985–1988).
First Turkish encyclopedia was Kamus-ül-Ulûm ve’l-Maarif written by Ali Suvai in 1870 after that Ahmet Rifat Efendi's 7 volumes work "Lûgaat-i Tarihiye ve Coğrafiye" (Dictionary of History and Geography) published in Istanbul at 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.yeniansiklopedi.com/ansiklopedi/ |title=Ansiklopedi (encyclopedia) (tr) |publisher=Yeniansiklopedi.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
[[File:EncycBrit1913.jpg|thumb|left|1913 advertisement for ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the oldest and one of the largest contemporary English encyclopedias.]]

Popular and affordable encyclopedias such as ''[[Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia]]'' and ''[[The Children's Encyclopædia]]'' appeared in the early 1920s.

In the United States, the 1950s and 1960s saw the introduction of several large popular encyclopedias, often sold on installment plans. The best known of these were ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]'' and ''[[Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia]]''.

The second half of the 20th century also saw the publication of several encyclopedias that were notable for synthesizing important topics in specific fields, often by means of new works authored by significant researchers. Such encyclopedias included ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (first published in 1967 and now in its second edition), and ''Elsevier's Handbooks In Economics''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/S04.cws_home/books |title=Economics and Finance – Elsevier |publisher=Elsevier.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; series. Encyclopedias of at least one volume in size exist for most if not all [[academic discipline]]s, including, typically, such narrow topics such as [[bioethics]] and [[African-American history]].

By the late 20th century, encyclopedias were being published on [[CD-ROM]]s for use with personal computers. [[Microsoft]]'s ''[[Encarta]]'', launched in 1993, was a landmark example as it had no printed equivalent. Articles were supplemented with video and audio files as well as numerous high-quality images. After sixteen years, Microsoft discontinued the Encarta line of products in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |title=Important Notice: MSN Encarta to be Discontinued |publisher=MSN Encarta |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwblMaEW?url=http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional encyclopedias are written by a number of employed text writers, usually people with an [[academic degree]], and distributed as [[Intellectual property|proprietary]] content.

Encyclopedias are essentially derivative from what has gone before, and particularly in the 19th century, [[copyright infringement]] was common among encyclopedia editors. However, modern encyclopedias are not merely larger compendia, including all that came before them. To make space for modern topics, valuable material of historic use regularly had to be discarded, at least before the advent of digital encyclopedias. Moreover, the opinions and world views of a particular generation can be observed in the encyclopedic writing of the time. For these reasons, old encyclopedias are a useful source of historical information, especially for a record of changes in science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Kobasa, Paul A. "Encyclopedia." World Book Online Reference Center. 2008. [Place of access.] 13 Jan. 2008 &lt;http://www.worldbookonline.com/wb/Login?ed=wb&amp;tu=%2Fwb%2FArticle%3Fid%3Dar180800&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, old encyclopedias whose [[public domain|copyright has expired]], such as the 1911 edition of ''Britannica'', are also the only [[free content]] English encyclopedias released in print form. However, works such as the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', which were created in the public domain,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} exist as free content encyclopedias in other languages.

===Emergence of free encyclopedias===
{{See also|History of wikis}}
The concept of a new free encyclopedia began with the [[Interpedia]] proposal on [[Usenet]] in 1993, which outlined an Internet-based [[online encyclopedia]] to which anyone could submit content and that would be freely accessible. Early projects in this vein included [[Everything2]] and [[Open Site]]. In 1999, [[Richard Stallman]] proposed the [[GNUPedia]], an online encyclopedia which, similar to the [[GNU operating system]], would be a "generic" resource. The concept was very similar to Interpedia, but more in line with Stallman's [[GNU]] philosophy.

It was not until [[Nupedia]] and later Wikipedia that a stable free encyclopedia project was able to be established on the Internet.

==Twenty-first century==
[[File:Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg|thumb|upright|Wikipedia is one of the first "[[user generated content]]" encyclopedias]]

The English Wikipedia, which was started in 2001, became the world's largest encyclopedia in 2004 at the 300,000 article stage&lt;ref&gt;[http://linuxreviews.org/news/2004/07/07_3000k/ "Wikipedia Passes 300,000 Articles making it the worlds largest encyclopedia"], ''Linux Reviews'', 2004 Julich y 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and by late 2005, Wikipedia had produced over two million articles in more than 80 languages with content licensed under the [[copyleft]] [[GNU Free Documentation License]]. As of August 2009, Wikipedia had over 3 million articles in English and well over 10 million combined in over 250 languages. Wikipedia currently has [[Special:Statistics|{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}]] articles in English. Since 2003, other free encyclopedias like the Chinese-language [[Baidu Baike]] and [[Hudong]], as well as English language encyclopedias like [[Citizendium]] and [[Knol]] have appeared. Knol has been discontinued.

An encyclopedia's hierarchical structure and evolving nature is particularly adaptable to a [[Digital media|digital format]], and all major printed general encyclopedias had moved to this method of delivery by the end of the 20th century. [[Disk storage|Disk-based]], typically [[DVD-ROM]] or [[CD-ROM]] format, publications have the advantage of being cheaply produced and easily portable. Additionally, they can include [[Electronic media|media]] which are impossible to store in the printed format, such as [[animation]]s, [[sound recording|audio]] and [[video]]. [[Hyperlink]]ing between conceptually related items is also a significant benefit, although even Diderot's encyclopedia had cross-referencing.

On-line encyclopedias offer the additional advantage of being dynamic: new information can be presented almost immediately, rather than waiting for the next release of a static format, as with a disk- or paper-based publication. Many printed encyclopedias traditionally published annual supplemental volumes ("yearbooks") to update events between editions, as a partial solution to the problem of staying up-to-date, but this of course required the reader to check both the main volumes and the supplemental volumes. Some disk-based encyclopedias offer subscription-based access to online updates, which are then integrated with the content already on the user's [[hard disk]] in a manner not possible with a printed encyclopedia.

Information in a printed encyclopedia necessarily needs some form of hierarchical structure. Traditionally, the method employed is to present the information ordered alphabetically by the article title. However, with the advent of dynamic electronic formats the need to impose a pre-determined structure is less necessary. Nonetheless, most electronic encyclopedias still offer a range of organizational strategies for the articles, such as by subject, area, or alphabetically.

Digital encyclopedias also offer greater search abilities than printed versions. While the printed versions rely on indexes to assist in searching for topics, computer accessible versions allow searching through article text for keywords or phrases.

Specialized encyclopedias may offer a more comprehensive content. For example, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ADAM Medical Encyclopedia (which includes over 4,000 articles about diseases, tests, symptoms, injuries, and surgeries), the Wiki Encyclopedia of Law and the Encyclopedia of Earth all provide a more focused list of topics.

In the Islamic Republic of Iran, recent works include the ''Encyclopaedia of the World of Islam'' prepared in 10 volumes by The Encyclopaedia Islamica Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/ |title=Encyclopaedia Islamica Foundation. بنیاد دائره المعارف اسلامی |publisher=Encyclopaediaislamica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Islam'' published as a four-volume English encyclopedia including around 1200 entries. Other such works are: the ''Encyclopedia of  Imam Ali'', the ''Encyclopedia of Qur'anology'', and the ''Encyclopedia of Lady Fātima'', all published by the Islamic Research Institute for Culture and Thought (IICT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ency.iict.ac.ir |title=پژوهشكده دانشنامه نگاري – پژوهشکده دانشنامه نگاری دینی |publisher=Ency.iict.ac.ir |date= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hamilton-burr-duel.jpg|thumb|Alexander Hamilton [[Burr–Hamilton duel|defends his honour]] by accepting Aaron Burr's challenge.]]

'''Honour''' (or '''honor''' in [[American English]]; either spelling in [[Canadian English]])&lt;ref&gt; The ''Gage Canadian Dictionary'' (1997) (p. vii) states: "Canadian usage is almost equally divided between -our and -or spellings in words such as colour/color and honour/honor, so both spellings are accepted by this Canadian dictionary as standard Canadian spelling."&lt;/ref&gt; is the idea of a bond between an individual and a society as a quality of a person that is both of social teaching and of personal [[ethos]], that manifests itself as a [[code of conduct]], and has various elements such as valor, chivalry, honesty, and compassion. It is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or institution such as a family, school, regiment or nation. Accordingly, individuals (or institutions) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific [[honour code|code of honour]], and the moral code of the society at large.

[[Samuel Johnson]], in his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1755), defined honour as having several senses, the first of which was "[[nobility]] of soul, [[magnanimity]], and a scorn of [[meanness]]".
This sort of honour derives from the perceived virtuous conduct and personal integrity of the person endowed with it.  On the other hand, Johnson also defined honour in relationship to "reputation" and "fame"; to "privileges of rank or birth", and as "respect" of the kind which "places an individual socially and determines his right to precedence". This sort of honour is often not so much a function of moral or ethical excellence, as it is a consequence of power. Finally, with respect to sexuality, ''honour'' has traditionally been associated with (or identical to) "chastity" or "virginity", or in case of married men and women, "fidelity". Some have argued that honour should be seen more as a rhetoric, or set of possible actions, than as a code.

== Social context ==
[[File:Wall of Honour, Royal Military College of Canada.jpg|thumb|right|Wall of Honour, [[Royal Military College of Canada]]]]

Honour as a code of behaviour defines the duties of an individual within a social group.  Margaret Visser observes that in an honour-based society "a person is what he or she is in the eyes of other people".&lt;ref name=Visser&gt;
{{cite news | first = Jim | last = Doris | title = A conversation with Margaret Visser: diagnosing that feeling of helplessness | date = 2003-01-05 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0MKY/is_1_27/ai_111696819/ | work = [[Catholic New Times]] | accessdate = 2011-03-10}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A '''code of honour''' differs from a legal code, also socially defined and concerned with justice, in that honour remains implicit rather than explicit and objectified.

One can distinguish honour from [[dignity]], which Wordsworth assessed as measured against an individual's conscience&lt;ref&gt;
"...dignity abides with him alone / Who, in the silent hour of inward thought, / Can still suspect, and still revere himself...." [[William Wordsworth]], "Yew Tree" http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww119.html.
&lt;/ref&gt; rather than against the judgement of a community. Compare also the sociological concept of [[Face (sociological concept)|"face"]].

In the early medieval period, a lord's or lady's honour was the group of manors or lands he or she held. "The word was first used indicating an estate which gave its holder dignity and status."&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases,'' Christopher Corédon, 2004, D.S. Brewer, Cambridge, {{ISBN|1-84384-023-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For a person to say "on my honour" was not just an affirmation of his or her [[integrity]] and rank, but the veracity behind that phrase meant he or she was willing to offer up estates as pledge and guarantee.

The concept of honour appears to have declined in importance in the modern [[Western world|West]];  [[conscience]] has replaced it&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last= Ignatieff|first= Michael|title= The Warrior's Honour: Ethnic War and the Modern Conscience|year= 1997|publisher= Henry Holt and Co.|location= New York, New York|pages= paraphrased from whole book}}
&lt;/ref&gt; in the individual context, and the rule of law (with the rights and duties defined therein) has taken over in a social context.  Popular [[stereotype]]s would have it surviving more definitively in more tradition-bound cultures (e.g. [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]], [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]], [[Poles|Polish]], [[Persian people|Persian]], [[Turkey|Turkish]], [[Arab]], [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]], "[[Old South]]" or [[Dixie]]) in a perception akin to [[Orientalism]]. Feudal or other agrarian societies, which focus upon land use and land ownership, may tend to "honour" more than do contemporary industrial societies. Note that Saint [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (c. 1033 – 1109) in ''[[Cur Deus Homo]]'' extended the concept of honour from his own feudal society to postulate God's honour.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

An emphasis on the importance of honour exists in such traditional institutions as the [[military]] (serving officers may conduct a [[court of honour]]) and in organisations with a military ethos, such as [[Scouting]] organisations (which also feature "Courts of Honour"&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;).

Honour in the case of sexuality frequently relates, historically, to [[fidelity]]: preservation of "honour" equates primarily to maintenance of the [[virginity]] of singles and to the exclusive [[monogamy]] of the remainder of the population. Further conceptions of this type of honour vary widely between cultures; some cultures regard [[honour killing]]s of (mostly female) members of one's own family as justified if the individuals have "defiled the family's honour" by marrying against the family's wishes, or even by becoming the victims of [[rape]]. Western observers generally see these honour killings as a way of men using the culture of honour to control female sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Honour killings of girls and women | date = 1999-08-31 | publisher = [[Amnesty International]] | url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA33/018/1999/en | work = Amnesty International library | accessdate = 2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinners, [[executioner]]s, [[Gravedigger|grave-diggers]], shepherds, [[Barber surgeon|barber-surgeons]], millers, linen-weavers, sow-gelders, [[Manual scavenging|latrine-cleaners]], and bailiffs and their families were among the "dishonourable people" (''unehrliche Leute'') in early modern German society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgeindia.org/showbookdetails.asp?ISBN=9780521652391&amp;category_id=63 Defiled Trades and Social Outcasts - Honor and Ritual Pollution in Early Modern Germany] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003064153/http://www.cambridgeindia.org/showbookdetails.asp?ISBN=9780521652391&amp;category_id=63 |date=3 October 2013 }}, Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultures of honour and cultures of law ==

Various sociologists and anthropologists have contrasted cultures of honour with cultures of law. A culture of law has a body of laws which all members of society must obey, with punishments for transgressors. This requires a society with the structures required to enact and enforce laws. A culture of law incorporates a social contract: members of society give up some aspects of their freedom to defend themselves and retaliate for injuries, on the understanding that society will apprehend and punish transgressors.

An alternative to government enforcement of laws is community or individual enforcement of social norms.

One way that honor functions is as a major factor of [[reputation]]. In a system where there is no court that will authorize the use of force to guarantee the execution of contracts, an honorable reputation is very valuable to promote [[Trust (emotion)|trust]] among transaction partners.  To dishonor an agreement could be economically ruinous, because all future potential transaction partners might stop trusting the party not to lie, steal their money or goods, not repay debts, mistreat the children they marry off, have children with other people, abandon their children, or fail to provide aid when needed.  A dishonorable person might be shunned by the community as a way to punish bad behavior and create an incentive for others to maintain their honor.

If one's honor is questioned, it can thus be important to disprove any false accusations or [[slander]].  In some cultures, the practice of [[dueling]] has arisen as a means to settle such disputes firmly, though by physical dominance in force or skill rather than by objective consideration of evidence and facts.

Honor can also imply [[duty]] to perform certain actions, such as providing for and disciplining one's children, serving in the military during war, contributing to local collective projects like building infrastructure, or exacting [[revenge]] in retaliation for acts one is directly harmed by.

The concept of personal honor can be extended to [[family honor]], which strengthens the incentives to follow social norms in two ways. First, the consequences of dishonorable actions (such as suicide or attempted robbery that results in death) outlive the perpetrator, and negatively affect family members they presumably care about.  Second, when one member of the family misbehaves, other members of the family are in the position to and are incentivized to strongly enforce the community norms.

In strong honor cultures, those who do not conform may be forced or pressured into conformance and transgressors punished physically or psychologically. The use of violence may be collective in its character, where many relatives act together.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hedersfortryck.se/hedersfortryck/vad-ar-hedersrelaterat-vald-och-fortryck/kollektivistiska-strukturer/|title=Kollektivistiska strukturer {{!}} Hedersförtryck.se|last=|first=|date=|work=County administrative board of Ostrogothia ([[Länsstyrelsen]] [[Östergötland]])|access-date=2017-11-15|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most extreme form of punishment is [[honor killing]].  Dueling and vengeance at a family level can result in a sustained [[feud]].

Honor-based cultures are also known as [[honor-shame culture]]s and contrasted with [[guilt society|guilt cultures]] on the [[Guilt-Shame-Fear spectrum of cultures]].

Cultures of honor are often conservative, encoding pre-modern traditional family values and duties.  In some cases these values clash with those of post-[[sexual revolution]] and [[egalitarian]] societies.  Add to this the prohibition against [[vigilante]] or individual justice-taking, [[cultures of law]] sometimes consider practices in honor cultures to be unethical or a violation of the legal concept of [[human right]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195396607/obo-9780195396607-0160.xml|title=Honor Cultures and Violence - Criminology - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/gavleborg/polisens-utredare-utbildades-i-om-hederskulturer|title=Polisens utredare utbildades om hederskulturer|last=Nyheter|first=SVT|work=SVT Nyheter|access-date=2017-11-15|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/25/middleeast/jordan-lebanon-marriage-rape-law/index.html|title=Activists demand end to marriage rape laws|last=CNN|first=Tamara Qiblawi,|work=CNN|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples around the world==

Historians have especially examined the [[Culture of honor (Southern United States)|culture of honor in American South]].&lt;ref&gt;Bertram.  Wyatt-Brown, ''Southern honor: Ethics and behavior in the Old South'' (Oxford University Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth S. Greenberg, ''Honor &amp; Slavery: Lies, Duels, Noses, Masks, Dressing as a Woman, Gifts, Strangers, Humanitarianism, Death, Slave Rebellions, the Proslavery Argument, Baseball, Hunting, and Gambling in the Old South'' (Princeton University Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Social scientists have looked at specialized subcultures such as South Asian Muslims in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pnina Werbner]], "Honor, shame and the politics of sexual embodiment among South Asian Muslims in Britain and beyond: An analysis of debates in the public sphere." ''International Social Science Review'' 6#1 (2005): 25-47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have compared multiple modern nations.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Helkama, et al. "Honor as a value in Finland, Estonia, Italy, Russia, and Switzerland." ''Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations'' 16#3 (2013): 279-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

One paper finds that present-day Canadians born in communities that historically lay outside the reach of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (Mounties) seem to inherit a violent code of honour that drives their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/opinion/sunday/canadas-history-of-violence.html|title=Canada’s History of Violence|last=Restrepo|first=Pascual|date=2015-10-09|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the viewpoint of anthropologists, cultures of honour typically appear among [[nomad]]ic peoples and among herdsmen who carry their most valuable [[property]] with them and risk having it stolen, without having recourse to law enforcement or to [[government]]. Due to the lack of strong institutions, cultivating a reputation for swift and disproportionate [[revenge]] increases the safety of one's person and property against aggressive actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Evolutionary Basis of Honor Cultures|url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/24/0956797615602860|journal = Psychological Science|date = 2015-11-25|issn = 0956-7976|pmid = 26607976|pages = 0956797615602860|doi = 10.1177/0956797615602860|language = en|first = Andrzej|last = Nowak|first2 = Michele J.|last2 = Gelfand|first3 = Wojciech|last3 = Borkowski|first4 = Dov|last4 = Cohen|first5 = Ivan|last5 = Hernandez|volume=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers ranging from [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] to [[Steven Pinker]] have remarked upon the mindset needed for a culture of honour.

According to Richard Nisbett, cultures of honour will often arise when three conditions&lt;ref name=coh&gt;
Richard Nisbett. ''Culture of Honor''. 1996. {{ISBN|0-8133-1992-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt; exist:

# a scarcity of resources
# situations in which the benefit of theft and crime outweighs the risks
# a lack of sufficient law-enforcement (such as in geographically remote regions)

Historically, cultures of honour exist in places where the herding of animals dominates an economy. In this situation the geography is usually extensive, since the soil cannot support extensive sustained farming and thus large populations; the benefit of stealing animals from other herds is high since it is the main form of wealth; and there is no central law-enforcement or rule of law. However cultures of honour can also appear in places like modern inner-city slums. The three conditions exist here as well: lack of resources (poverty); crime and theft have a high rewards compared to the alternatives (few); and law enforcement is generally lax or corrupt.&lt;ref name=coh/&gt;

Once a culture of honour exists in a society, its members find it difficult to make the transition to a culture of law; this requires that people become willing to back down and refuse to immediately retaliate, and from the viewpoint of the culture of honour, the feeling humiliation makes personal restraint extremely difficult as it reflects weakness and appeasement.

==Honour as a cause of war ==
===The War of 1812===
Historian Norman Risjord has emphasised the central importance of honor as a cause of the [[War of 1812]], which the United States launched in against Britain despite its much more powerful naval and military strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Risjord | first1 = Norman K. | year = | title = 1812: Conservatives, War Hawks and the Nation's Honor | journal = William and Mary Quarterly: A Magazine of Early American History | volume = 1961 | issue = | pages = 196–210 | jstor=1918543}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Americans of every political stripe saw the need to uphold national honor, and to reject  the treatment of the United States by Britain as a third class nonentity. Americans talked incessantly about the need for force in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ivie | first1 = Robert L. | year = 1982 | title = The metaphor of force in prowar discourse: The case of 1812 | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Speech | volume = 68 | issue = 3| pages = 240–253 | doi=10.1080/00335638209383610}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quest for honor was a major cause of the war in the sense that most Americans who were not involved in mercantile interests or threatened by Indian attack strongly endorsed the preservation of national honor.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford Perkins, ''The causes of the War of 1812: National honor or national interest?''

:National honor, the reputation of republican government, and the continuing supremacy of the Republican party had seemed to be at stake&amp;nbsp;... National honor had [now] been satisfied," says historian Lance Banning, "Americans celebrated the end of the struggle with a brilliant burst of national pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lance Banning|title=The Jeffersonian Persuasion: Evolution of a Party Ideology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YL-HcJj1MO0C&amp;pg=PA295|year=1980|publisher=Cornell UP|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British showed a respect for American honor. "Some of the strongest praise for America and swiftest recognition of what the young republic had achieved for American honor, prestige, and power came from within British naval circles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pietro S.

A 2016 study suggests that honour culture increases the risk of war. The study found that international conflicts under U.S. presidents who were raised in the American South "are shown to be twice as likely to involve uses of force, last on average twice as long, and are three times more likely to end in victory for the United States than disputes under non-Southern presidents. Other characteristics of Southern presidencies do not seem able to account for this pattern of results."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dafoe|first=Allan|last2=Caughey|first2=Devin|date=2016-04-01|title=Honor and War|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0043887115000416|journal=World Politics|volume=68|issue=02|pages=341–381|doi=10.1017/S0043887115000416|issn=1086-3338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary [[international relations]], the concept of "credibility" resembles that of honour, as when the credibility of a state or of an alliance appears to be at stake, and honour-bound politicians call for drastic measures.

Compare the concepts of [[integrity]] and [[Face (social concept)|face]] in [[stereotype]]d East Asian cultures, or of [[mana]] in [[Polynesia]]n society.

The [[ancient Greek]] concepts of honour (''timē'') included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honour, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of [[hubris]]. This concept of honour resembles a [[zero-sum game]].

In ancient [[China]] during the [[Warring States]] period, honour in battle was one of the many forms of virtue practised by the nobility. In one oft-cited example, [[Duke Xiang of Song|Duke Xiang]] of the Song state chose not to take the enemy by surprise; instead, he and his forces waited for the enemy to go across the river.  This marked conduct worthy of the accolade descriptor ''ren'' ([[wikt:仁|仁]]), worthy of the name of "gentleman". In response to this textbook example, Mao Zedong is quoted: "We are not Duke Xiang of Song and have no use for his idiotic virtue and morality."

Pre-modern [[Korea]]n thought and society was largely dominated by the preservation of honour and was especially concerned with the ruling [[yangban]] elite in the [[Joseon]] dynasty. In particular, one of the most profound influences from the Joseon Dynasty is the figure of the [[Seonbi]], or "virtuous scholar". The seonbi were ideal, exemplary noblemen of Confucian teachings who exhibited high competency in both academics and martial arts. Despite their obvious qualifications for important government posts, the seonbi eschewed titles and extravagance for the sake of personal development, often living in humble homes. They were expected to be fiercely loyal to the [[King of Joseon]] and lay down their lives in battle or in defense of their King, rather than choose treason. Inspired by the righteous nature of the seonbi, the modern Korean term of the "seonbi spirit" calls for maintaining personal honour and conduct, even in the face of certain death.

According to [[Bushido]], honour was always seen as a duty by [[Samurai]].{{cn|date=May 2017}} When one lost their honour or the situation made them lose it, the only way to save their dignity was by death. [[Seppuku]] (vulgarly called "[[harakiri]]", or "belly-cutting") was the most honourable death in that situation. The only way for a Samurai to die more honourably was to be killed in a battle by a sword.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

== Awards ==
[[File:Panteón de Hombres Ilustres (Madrid) 02a.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Honor Mosaic c 1914 in the [[Pantheon of Illustrious Men]], Madrid (Spain)]]
As a countable noun, ''honour'' may refer to an award, e.g. given   by the [[State (polity)|state]]. Such honours include military [[medal]]s, but more typically imply a civilian award, such as a British [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], a [[knighthood]] or membership of the French [[Légion d'honneur]].

But surely a system can be consistent and complete without being true in the sense that Fichte himself considered most important, that is, without possessing any extra-systematic basis in something certain.

Fichte also wrote works of [[political philosophy]]; he has a reputation as one of the fathers of [[German nationalism]].

==Biography==

===Origins===
Fichte was born in [[Rammenau]], [[Upper Lusatia]]. The son of a ribbon weaver,&lt;ref name="nie"&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Fichte, Johann Gottlieb|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; he came of peasant stock which had lived in the region for many generations. The family was noted in the neighborhood for its probity and piety. Christian Fichte, Johann Gottlieb's father, married somewhat above his station. It has been suggested that a certain impatience which Fichte himself displayed throughout his life was an inheritance from his mother.&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;

Young Fichte received the rudiments of his education from his father. He showed remarkable ability from an early age, and it was owing to his reputation among the villagers that he gained the opportunity for a better education than he otherwise would have received. The story runs that the Freiherr von Militz, a country landowner, arrived too late to hear the local pastor preach. He was, however, informed that a lad in the neighborhood would be able to repeat the sermon practically verbatim. As a result, the baron took the lad into his protection, which meant that he paid his tuition.&lt;ref name="americana"&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Fichte, Johann Gottlieb|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early schooling===
Fichte was placed in the family of Pastor Krebel at [[Niederau]] near [[Meissen]] and there received thorough grounding in the [[classics]]. From this time onward, Fichte saw little of his parents. In October 1774, he was attending the celebrated foundation-school at [[Pforta]] near [[Naumburg]]. This school is associated with the names of [[Novalis]], [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]], [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. The spirit of the institution was semi-monastic and, while the education given was excellent in its way, it is doubtful whether there was enough social life and contact with the world for a pupil of Fichte's temperament and antecedents. Perhaps his education strengthened a tendency toward introspection and independence, characteristics which appear strongly in his doctrines and writings.&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;

===Theological studies and private tutoring===
In 1780, he began study at the theology seminary of [[University of Jena]]. He was transferred a year later to study at the [[Leipzig University]]. Fichte seems to have supported himself at this period of bitter poverty and hard struggle.&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt; Freiherr von Militz continued to support him, but when he died in 1784, Fichte had to end his studies prematurely, without completing his degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Breazeale|first1=Daniel|last2=Fichte|first2=Johann|title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years 1784 to 1788, he supported himself in a precarious way as tutor in various Saxon families.&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt; In early 1788, he returned to [[Leipzig]] in the hope of finding a better employment, but eventually he had to settle for a much less promising position with the family of an innkeeper in [[Zurich]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. La Vopa, ''Fichte: The Self and the Calling of Philosophy, 1762-1799'', Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in Zurich for the next two years (1788–1790), which was a time of great contentment for him. There he met his future wife, Johanna Rahn,&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;She happened to be the niece of the famous poet [[F. G. Klopstock]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]]. There he also became in 1793 a member of the [[Freemasonry]] lodge "Modestia cum Libertate" with which [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] was also connected.&lt;ref&gt;Imhof, Gottlieb (1959).

Amsterdam-Atlanta: Editions Rodopi, p. 204, {{ISBN|90-5183-236-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1790, he became engaged to Johanna.&lt;ref name="La Vopa 151"&gt;Anthony J. La Vopa, ''Fichte: The Self and the Calling of Philosophy, 1762-1799'', Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1790, Fichte began to study the works of Kant, but this occurred initially because one of his students wanted to know about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Breazeale|first1=Daniel|last2=Fichte|first2=Johann|title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had a lasting effect on the trajectory of his life and thought. While he was assimilating the Kantian philosophy and preparing to develop it, fate dealt him a blow: the Rahn family had suffered financial reverses, and his impending marriage had to be postponed.&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;

===Kant===
From Zurich, Fichte returned to Leipzig in May 1790.&lt;ref name="La Vopa 151"/&gt; In the spring of 1791, he obtained a tutorship at [[Warsaw]] in the house of a [[Polish people|Polish]] nobleman. The situation, however, quickly proved disagreeable and he was released. He then got a chance to see Kant at [[Königsberg]]. After a disappointing interview on July 4 of the same year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Breazeale|first1=Daniel|last2=Fichte|first2=Johann|title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; he shut himself in his lodgings and threw all his energies into the composition of an essay which would compel Kant's attention and interest. This essay, completed in five weeks, was the ''Versuch einer Critik&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; aller Offenbarung'' (''[[Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation]]'', 1792).&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt; In this book, according to Henrich, Fichte investigated the connections between divine revelation and Kant's [[critical philosophy]]. The first edition of the book was published without Kant or Fichte's knowledge, moreover without Fichte's name or signed preface.  It was thus mistakenly thought to be a new work by Kant himself.&lt;ref&gt;Traditionally, it has been assumed that either the omission was an accident or a deliberate attempt by the publisher to move copies. In either case, Fichte did not plan it and in fact only heard of the accident much later.  He writes to his fiancée: "Why did I have to have such utterly strange, excellent, unheard-of good luck?" See Garrett Green's Introduction to ''Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews were assuming Kant was the author when Kant cleared the confusion and openly praised the work and author. Fichte's reputation skyrocketed as many intellectuals of the day were of the opinion that it was "the most shocking and astonishing news... [since] nobody but Kant could have written this book. This amazing news of a third sun in the philosophical heavens has set me into such confusion".&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Jens Baggeson to Karl Reinhold. Quoted in Editor's Introduction to Fichte, ''Early Philosophical Writings''. London: Cornell University Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Karl Popper]] considers the book as essentially "a fraud" which though rather boring cleverly imitated Kant's style and that the rumours that Kant himself had written the book to be contrived.&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl. "The Open Society and Its Enemies." Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994. Vol 2, p 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant waited seven years to make public statement about the incident; after considerable external pressure he dissociated himself from Fichte. In his statement, he inscribed, "May God protect us from our friends. From our enemies, we can try to protect ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl. "The Open Society and Its Enemies." Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994. Vol 2, p 266. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Jena===
In October 1793, he was married in Zurich, where he remained the rest of the year. Stirred by the events and principles of the [[French Revolution]], he wrote and anonymously published two pamphlets which led to him being seen as a devoted defender of liberty of thought and action and an advocate of political changes. In December of the same year, he received an invitation to fill the position of extraordinary professor of philosophy at the [[University of Jena]]. He accepted and began his lectures in May of the next year. With extraordinary zeal, he expounded his system of "[[transcendental idealism]]". His success was immediate. He seems to have excelled as a lecturer because of the earnestness and force of his personality. These lectures were later published under the title ''The Vocation of the Scholar'' (''Einige Vorlesungen über die Bestimmung des Gelehrten''). He gave himself up to intense production, and a succession of works soon appeared.&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;

===Atheism Dispute===
{{main|Atheism Dispute}}
After weathering a couple of academic storms, he was finally dismissed from Jena in 1799 as a result of a charge of atheism. He was accused of atheism in 1798 after publishing his essay "Ueber&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; den Grund unsers&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; Glaubens an eine göttliche Weltregierung" ("On the Ground of Our Belief in a Divine World-Governance"), which he had written in response to [[Friedrich Karl Forberg]]'s essay "Development of the Concept of Religion", in his ''Philosophical Journal''. For Fichte, God should be conceived primarily in moral terms: "The living and efficaciously acting moral order is itself God. We require no other God, nor can we grasp any other" ("On the Ground of Our Belief in a Divine World-Governance").

Fichte's intemperate "Appeal to the Public" ("Appellation an das Publikum", 1799) provoked [[F. H. Jacobi]] to publish an [[open letter]] to Fichte, in which he equated philosophy in general and Fichte's [[transcendental philosophy]] in particular with [[nihilism]].&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;

===Berlin===
Since all the German states except Prussia had joined in the cry against him, he was forced to go to Berlin. There he associated himself with the Schlegels, [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Ludwig Tieck|Tieck]].&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;

In April 1800, through the introduction of Hungarian writer [[Ignaz Aurelius Fessler]], he was initiated into [[Freemasonry]] in the Lodge Pythagoras of the Blazing Star where he was elected minor warden. At first Fichte was a warm admirer of Fessler, and was disposed to aid him in his proposed Masonic reform. But later he became Fessler's bitter opponent. Their controversy attracted much attention among Freemasons.&lt;ref name="Mackey"&gt;{{Cite book|journal=Mackey's National Freemason|title=Fichte as a Freemason: October 1872 to September 1873|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ip5bF1xtRB0C&amp;pg=PA430|page=430|date=2003|editor=Albert G. Mackey|isbn=9780766157170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fichte presented two lectures on the philosophy of Masonry during the same period as part of his work on the development of various [[Masonic degree|higher degrees]] for the lodge in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Magee 55"&gt;Glenn Alexander Magee, ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition'', Cornell University Press, 2008, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; A certain Johann Karl Christian Fischer, a high official of the [[Grand Orient]], published those lectures in 1802/03 in two volumes under the title ''Philosophy of Freemasonry: Letters to Konstant'' (''Philosophie der Maurerei. Briefe an Konstant''), where Konstant referred to a fictitious non-Mason.&lt;ref name="Magee 55"/&gt;

In November 1800, Fichte published ''The Closed Commercial State: A Philosophical Sketch as an Appendix to the Doctrine of Right and an Example of a Future Politics'' (''Der geschlossene Handelsstaat. Ein philosophischer Entwurf als Anhang zur Rechtslehre und Probe einer künftig zu liefernden Politik''), a philosophical statement of his property theory, a historical analysis of European economic relations, and a political proposal for reforming them.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Nakhimovsky, ''The Closed Commercial State: Perpetual Peace and Commercial Society from Rousseau to Fichte'', Princeton University Press, 2011, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1805, he was appointed to a professorship in [[University of Erlangen|Erlangen]]. The [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|disaster at Jena]] in 1806, in which [[Napoleon]] completely crushed the Prussian army, drove him to Königsberg for a time, but he returned to Berlin in 1807 and continued his literary activity.&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;

The deplorable situation of Germany stirred him to the depths and led him to deliver the famous ''[[Addresses to the German Nation]]'' (''Reden an die deutsche Nation'', 1808) which guided the uprising against Napoleon. He became a professor of the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|new university at Berlin]] founded in 1810. By the votes of his colleagues Fichte was unanimously elected its rector in the succeeding year. But, once more, his impetuosity and reforming zeal led to friction, and he resigned in 1812. The campaign against Napoleon began, and the hospitals at Berlin were soon full of patients. Fichte's wife devoted herself to nursing and caught a virulent fever. Just as she was recovering, he himself was stricken down. He died of [[typhus]] at the age of 51.&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;

His son, [[Immanuel Hermann Fichte]] (18 July 1796 – 8 August 1879), also made contributions to [[philosophy]].

==Philosophical work==
In mimicking Kant's difficult style, his critics argued that Fichte produced works that were barely intelligible. "He made no hesitation in pluming himself on his great skill in the shadowy and obscure, by often remarking to his pupils, that 'there was only one man in the world who could fully understand his writings; and even he was often at a loss to seize upon his real meaning.'"&lt;ref&gt;Robert Blakely, ''History of the Philosophy of Mind'', Vol. IV, p. 114, London: Longmans, 1850&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Fichte himself acknowledged the difficulty of his writings, but argued that his works were clear and transparent to those who made the effort to think without preconceptions and prejudices.

Fichte did not endorse Kant's argument for the existence of [[noumenon|noumena]], of "things in themselves", the supra-sensible reality beyond the categories of direct human perception. Fichte saw the rigorous and [[system]]atic separation of "things in themselves" ([[noumenon|noumena]]) and things "as they appear to us" ([[phenomenon|phenomena]]) as an invitation to [[skepticism]]. Rather than invite such skepticism, Fichte made the radical suggestion that we should throw out the notion of a noumenal world and instead accept the fact that [[consciousness]] does not have a grounding in a so-called "real world". In fact, Fichte achieved fame for originating the argument that consciousness is not grounded in ''anything'' outside of itself. The phenomenal world as such, arises from self-consciousness; the activity of the ego; and moral awareness. His student (and critic), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], wrote:

{{Quotation|Fichte who, because the [[thing-in-itself]] had just been discredited, at once prepared a system without any thing-in-itself. Consequently, he rejected the assumption of anything that was not through and through merely our [[Representation (psychology)|representation]], and therefore let the knowing [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] be all in all or at any rate produce everything from its own resources. For this purpose, he at once did away with the essential and most meritorious part of the [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian doctrine, the distinction between ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' and ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' and thus that between the [[phenomenon]] and the thing-in-itself. For he declared everything to be ''a priori'', naturally without any evidence for such a monstrous assertion; instead of these, he gave sophisms and even crazy sham demonstrations whose absurdity was concealed under the mask of profundity and of the incomprehensibility ostensibly arising therefrom. Moreover, he appealed boldly and openly to [[intellectual]] [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], that is, really to [[Invention|inspiration]].|Arthur Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. I, §13}}

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] was also a student of the writings of Fichte: 
{{Quotation|Our whole age is imbued with a formal striving. This is what led us to disregard congeniality and to emphasize symmetrical beauty, to prefer conventional rather than sincere social relations. It is this whole striving which is denoted by — to use the words of another author — Fichte's and the other philosophers' attempts to construct systems by sharpness of mind and Robespierre's attempt to do it with the help of the guillotine; it is this which meets us in the flowing butterfly verses of our poets and in Auber's music, and finally, it is this which produces the many revolutions in the political world. I agree perfectly with this whole effort to cling to form, insofar as it continues to be the medium through which we have the idea, but it should not be forgotten that it is the idea which should determine the form, not the form which determines the idea. We should keep in mind that life is not something abstract but something extremely individual. We should not forget that, for example, from a poetic genius' position of immediacy, form is nothing but the coming into existence of the idea in the world, and that the task of reflection is only to investigate whether or not the idea has gotten the properly corresponding form. Form is not the basis of life, but life is the basis of form. Imagine that a man long infatuated with the Greek mode of life had acquired the means to arrange for a building in the Greek style and a Grecian household establishment — whether or not he would be satisfied would be highly problematical, or would he soon prefer another form simply because he had not sufficiently tested himself and the system in which he lived. But just as a leap backward is wrong (something the age, on the whole, is inclined to acknowledge), so also a leap forward is wrong — both of them because a natural development does not proceed by leaps, and life's earnestness will ironize over every such experiment, even if it succeeds momentarily.|Søren Kierkegaard, ''Journals'', "Our Journalistic Literature", November 28, 1835&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Kierkegaard,Soren/JournPapers/I_B.html Journals and Papers of Søren Kierkegaard, 1B]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Central theory===
{{refimprove|section|date=May 2017}}
In his work ''[[Foundations of Natural Right]]'' (1797), Fichte argued that [[self-awareness|self-consciousness]] was a social phenomenon — an important step and perhaps the first clear step taken in this direction by modern philosophy. A necessary condition of every subject's self-awareness, for Fichte, is the existence of other rational subjects. These others call or summon (''fordern auf'') the subject or self out of its unconsciousness and into an awareness of itself as a free individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foundations of Natural Right|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/96398724/Fichte-Foundations-of-Natural-Right-1797|website=Scribd|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fichte's account proceeds from the general principle that the I (''das Ich'') must posit itself as an individual in order to posit (''setzen'') itself at all, and that in order to posit itself as an individual it must recognize itself as it were to a calling or summons (''Aufforderung'') by other free individual(s) — called, moreover, to limit its own freedom out of respect for the freedom of the other. The same condition applied and applies, of course, to the other(s) in its development. Hence, mutual recognition (''gegenseitig anerkennen'') of rational individuals turns out to be a condition necessary for the individual I in general.&lt;ref&gt;Fichte, J. G. (2000), ''Foundations of Natural Right, according to the Principles of the Wissenschaftslehre'', ed. F. Neuhouser, trans. M. Baur. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen W. Wood]], ''The Free Development of Each: Studies on Reason, Right, and Ethics in Classical German Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 207: "The whole point of the summons, in fact, is that it is what first makes our individuality possible for us, through presenting us with the concept of our own individual free action in the form of an object of our consciousness."&lt;/ref&gt; This argument for [[intersubjectivity]] is central to the conception of selfhood developed in the ''[[Foundations of the Science of Knowledge]]''&lt;ref&gt;Also translated as ''Foundations of the Entire Science of Knowledge''.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Grundlage der gesamten&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; Wissenschaftslehre'', 1794/1795). In Fichte's view consciousness of the self depends upon resistance or a check by something that is understood as not part of the self yet is not immediately ascribable to a particular sensory perception.  In his later 1796–1799 lectures (his ''Nova methodo''), Fichte incorporated it into his revised presentation of the very foundations of his system, where the summons takes its place alongside original feeling, which takes the place of the earlier ''Anstoss'' (see below) as both a limit upon the absolute freedom of the I and a condition for the positing of the same.

The I itself posits this situation for itself. To posit does not mean to 'create' the objects of consciousness. The principle in question simply states that the essence of an I lies in the assertion of one's own self-identity, i.e., that consciousness presupposes self-consciousness. Such immediate self-identity, however, cannot be understood as a psychological fact, nor as an act or accident of some previously existing substance or being. It is an action of the I, but one that is identical with the very existence of this same I. In Fichte's technical terminology, the original unity of self-consciousness is to be understood both as an action and as the product of the same I, as a "fact and/or act" (''Thathandlung''; [[Modern German]]: ''Tathandlung''), a unity that is presupposed by and contained within every fact and every act of empirical consciousness, although it never appears as such therein.

The I must posit itself in order to be an I at all; but it can posit itself only insofar as it posits itself as limited. Moreover, it cannot even posit for itself its own limitations, in the sense of producing or creating these limits. The finite I cannot be the ground of its own passivity. Instead, for Fichte, if the I is to posit itself off at all, it must simply discover itself to be limited, a discovery that Fichte characterizes as an "impulse,"&lt;ref&gt;Breazeale 2013, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; "repulse,"&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Adams, George Pattison, Graham Ward (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Theology and Modern European Thought'', Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; or "resistance"&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Reid, ''The Anti-Romantic: Hegel Against Ironic Romanticism'', A&amp;C Black, 2014, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Anstoss''; Modern German: ''[[wikt:Anstoß|Anstoß]]'') to the free practical activity of the I. Such an original limitation of the I is, however, a limit for the I only insofar as the I posits it out as a limit. The I does this, according to Fichte's analysis, by positing its own limitation, first, as only a feeling, then as a sensation, then as an intuition of a thing, and finally as a summons of another person. The ''Anstoss'' thus provides the essential impetus that first posits in motion the entire complex train of activities that finally result in our conscious experience both of ourselves and others as empirical individuals and of the world around us.

Though ''Anstoss'' plays a similar role as the [[thing in itself]] does in [[Kantian]] philosophy, unlike Kant, Fichte's ''Anstoss'' is not something foreign to the I. Instead, it denotes the original encounter of the I with its own finitude. Rather than claim that the not-I (''das Nicht-Ich'') is the cause or ground of the ''Anstoss'', Fichte argues that not-I is posited by the I precisely in order to explain to itself the ''Anstoss'', that is, in order to become conscious of ''Anstoss''.

Though the ''Wissenschaftslehre'' demonstrates that such an ''Anstoss'' must occur if self-consciousness is to come about, it is quite unable to deduce or to explain the actual occurrence of such an ''Anstoss'' — except as a condition for the possibility of consciousness. Accordingly, there are strict limits to what can be expected from any a priori deduction of experience, and this limitation, for Fichte, equally applies to Kant's transcendental philosophy.

According to Fichte, transcendental philosophy can explain that the world must have space, time, and causality, but it can never explain why objects have the particular sensible properties they happen to have or why I am this determinate individual rather than another. This is something that the I simply has to discover at the same time that it discovers its own freedom, and indeed, as a condition for the latter.

[[Dieter Henrich]] (1966) proposed that Fichte was able to move beyond a "reflective theory of consciousness". According to Fichte, the self must already have some prior acquaintance with itself, independent of the act of reflection ("no object comes to consciousness except under the condition that I am aware of myself, the conscious subject [''jedes Object kommt zum Bewusstseyn lediglich unter der Bedingung, dass ich auch meiner selbst, des bewusstseyenden Subjects mir bewusst sey'']").&lt;ref&gt;Fichte, J. G., ''Versuch einer neuen Darstellung der Wissenschaftslehre'' (1797/1798): II.2; ''Gesamtausgabe'' I/4:274–275.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is what Henrich called [[Fichte's original insight]].&lt;ref name="Henrich"&gt;[[Dieter Henrich]], "Fichte's Original Insight", ''Contemporary German Philosophy'' 1 (1982 [1966]), ed. by Darrel E. Christensen ''et al.'', pp. 15–52 (translation of Henrich, Dieter (1966), "Fichtes ursprüngliche Einsicht", in: ''Subjektivität und Metaphysik. Festschrift für Wolfgang Cramer'' edited by D. Henrich und H. Wagner, Frankfurt/M., pp. 188–232). Henrich's article is an analysis of the following three presentations of the ''[[Gnosology|Wissenschaftslehre]]'': ''[[Foundations of the Science of Knowledge|Grundlage der gesamten&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; Wissenschaftslehre]]'' (''Foundations of the Science of Knowledge'', 1794/1795), ''Versuch einer neuen Darstellung der Wissenschaftslehre'' (''An Attempt a New Presentation of the Wissenschaftslehre'', 1797/1798), and ''Darstellung der Wissenschaftslehre'' (''Presentation of the Wissenschaftslehre'', 1801).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
Fichte also developed a theory of the state based on the idea of self-sufficiency. In his mind, the state should control international relations, the value of money, and remain an [[autarky]].  Because of this necessity to have relations with other rational beings in order to achieve consciousness, Fichte writes that there must be a 'relation of right', in which there is a mutual recognition of rationality by both parties.

===Nationalism===
Between December 1807 and March 1808, Fichte gave a series of lectures concerning the "German nation" and its culture and language, projecting the kind of national education he hoped would raise it from the humiliation of its defeat at the hands of the French. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Allen|title=Fichte's Ethical Thought |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been a supporter of Revolutionary France, Fichte became disenchanted by 1804 as Napoleon's armies advanced through Europe, occupying German territories, stripping them of their raw materials and subjugating them to foreign rule. Consequently, Fichte came to believe Germany would be responsible to carry the virtues of the French Revolution into the future. Furthermore, his nationalism was not aroused by Prussian military defeat and humiliation, for these had not yet occurred, but resulted from devotion to his own humanitarian philosophy. Through disappointment in the French he turned to the German nation as the instrument of fulfilling it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Eugene|title=Nationalism and the Culture Crisis in Prussia: 1806-1815|year=1966|publisher=Octagon Press|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lectures, entitled the ''Addresses to the German Nation'', coincided with a period of reform in the Prussian government, under the chancellorship of [[Baron vom Stein]]. The ''Addresses'' display Fichte's interest during that period in language and culture as vehicles of human spiritual development. Fichte built upon the earlier ideas of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and attempted to unite them with his more systematic approach. The aim of the German nation, according to Fichte, was to "found an empire of spirit and reason, and to annihilate completely the crude physical force that rules of the world."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fichte|first=Johann Gottlieb|title=Addresses to the German Nation|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Herder's German nationalism, Fichte's was wholly cultural, and grounded in the aesthetic, literary, and moral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Allen|title=Fichte's Ethical Thought|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nationalism propounded by Fichte in the ''Addresses'' would be appealed to over a century later by the Nazi Party in Germany, which sought in Fichte a forerunner to its own nationalist ideology. Like [[Nietzsche]], the association of Fichte with the Nazi regime came to colour readings of Fichte's German nationalism in the post-war period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Rohan|title=The Roots of National Socialism|year=1941|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|page=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reading of Fichte was often bolstered through reference to an unpublished letter from 1793, ''Contributions to the Correction of the Public's Judgment concerning the French Revolution'', wherein Fichte expressed anti-semitic sentiments, such as arguing against extending civil rights to Jews and calling them a "state within a state" that could "undermine" the German nation.&lt;ref name="Gesamtausgabe I/1 pp. 292"&gt;''Gesamtausgabe'', I/1, pp.&amp;nbsp;292–293&lt;/ref&gt; However, attached to the letter is a footnote in which Fichte provides an impassioned plea for permitting Jews to practice their religion without hindrance. Furthermore, the final act of Fichte's academic career was to resign as rector of Humboldt University in protest when his colleagues refused to punish the harassment of Jewish students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Allen|title=Fichte's Ethical Thought|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; While recent scholarship has sought to dissociate Fichte's writings on nationalism with his adoption by the Nazi Party, the association continues to blight his legacy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Allen|title=Fichte's Ethical Thought|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Fichte, as if to exclude all ground of doubt, clearly and distinctly prohibits —&amp;nbsp;in his reworked version of ''The Science of Ethics as Based on the Science of Knowledge'' (see [[#Final period in Berlin|§ Final period in Berlin]])&amp;nbsp;— genocide and other crimes against humanity:

===Women===
Fichte argued that "active citizenship, civic freedom and even property rights should be withheld from women, whose calling was to subject themselves utterly to the authority of their fathers and husbands."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher M. Clark, ''Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600-1947'' (Harvard University Press, 2006: {{ISBN|0-674-02385-4}}), p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final period in Berlin==
[[File:Dorotheenst Friedhof Fichte.jpg|thumb|Tombs of Johann Gottlieb Fichte and his wife Johanna Marie, [[:de:Friedhof der Dorotheenstädtischen und Friedrichswerderschen Gemeinden|Dorotheenstaedtischer Friedhof]] (cemetery), Berlin]]
Fichte gave a wide range of public and private lectures in Berlin from the last decade of his life. These form some of his best known work, and are the basis of a revived German-speaking scholarly interest in his work.&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;Breazeale, Dan, "Johann Gottlieb Fichte", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL: &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2012/entries/johann-fichte/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lectures include two works from 1806. In ''The Characteristics of the Present Age'' (''Die Grundzüge des gegenwärtigen Zeitalters''), Fichte outlines his theory of different historical and cultural epochs. His mystic work ''The Way Towards the Blessed Life'' (''Die Anweisung zum seligen Leben oder auch die Religionslehre'') gave his fullest thoughts on religion. In 1808 he gave a series of speeches in French-occupied Berlin, ''Addresses to the German Nation''.

In 1810, the new [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] was set up, designed along lines put forward by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Fichte was made its rector and also the first Chair of Philosophy. This was in part because of educational themes in the ''Addresses'', and in part because of his earlier work at Jena University.

Fichte lectured on further versions of his ''Wissenschaftslehre''. Of these, he only published a brief work from 1810, ''The Science of Knowledge in its General Outline'' (''Die Wissenschaftslehre, in ihrem allgemeinen Umrisse dargestellt''; also translated as ''Outline of the Doctrine of Knowledge''). His son published some of these thirty years after his death.

Most only became public in the last decades of the twentieth century, in his collected works.&lt;ref&gt;''Gesamtausgabe der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften'', approx. 40 volumes. Edited by {{ill|Reinhard Lauth|de}}, Erich Fuchs, Hans Gliwitzky, Ives Radrizzani, Günter Zöller, et al., Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; This included reworked versions of the ''Doctrine of Science'' (''Wissenschaftslehre'', 1810–1813), ''The Science of Rights'' (''Das System der Rechtslehre'', 1812), and ''The Science of Ethics as Based on the Science of Knowledge'' (''Das System der Sittenlehre nach den Principien der Wissenschaftslehre'', 1812; 1st ed. 1798).

'''Karin Knorr Cetina''' (also '''Karin Knorr-Cetina''') (born 19 July 1944 in [[Graz]], [[Austria]]) is an [[Austria]]n [[sociology|sociologist]] well known for her work on [[epistemology]] and [[social constructionism]], summarized in the books ''The Manufacture of Knowledge: An Essay on the Constructivist and Contextual Nature of Science'' (1981) and ''Epistemic Cultures: How the Sciences Make Knowledge'' (1999). Currently, she focuses on the study of [[global microstructures]] and [[Social studies of finance]]. Knorr Cetina is the
Otto Borchert Distinguished Service Professor (Jointly Appointed in Anthropology) and Chair of the Department of Sociology at the [[University of Chicago]].

A ''knowledge object'' is a theoretical concept introduced by Knorr Cetina to describe the emergence of post-social relations in [[epistemic cultures]]. Knowledge objects are different from everyday things and are defined as unfolding structures that are non-identical with themselves; [[Jyri Engeström]] based the concept of [[social objects]] on this concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Engeström|first=Jyri|title=Why some social network services work and others don’t — Or: the case for object-centered sociality|url=http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2005/04/why-some-social-network-services-work-and-others-dont-or-the-case-for-object-centered-sociality.html|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Knorr-Cetina studied at the [[University of Vienna]], receiving a Ph.D. in Cultural Anthropology (with a minor in sociology) in 1971. Her dissertation research focused on the structural analysis of oral literature. She shifted her focus toward sociology as she found that cultural anthropology at the time was too focused on historical concerns, while she was more interested in contemporary social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uvhVALUQbG4C|title=Taking the Naturalistic Turn, Or How Real Philosophy of Science Is Done|last=Bechtel|first=William|last2=Callebaut|first2=Werner|date=1993-12-01|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226091860|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the completion of her doctorate, Knorr-Cetina went to the Institute for Advanced Studies in Vienna, where many influential sociologists were invited to give presentations. This resulted in a Post-doctoral diploma in sociology, and an appointment as an instructor in anthropology at the University of Vienna from 1972–73, and then in sociology from 1973-76. During this time, Knorr-Cetina engaged in her first empirical investigations of science leading the 1975 publication (with Hermann Strasser and Hans Georg Zilian) ''Determinants and Controls of Scientific Development''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gfi_iPJPKnkC|title=Determinants and Controls of Scientific Development|last=Knorr|first=K. D.|last2=Strasser|first2=H.|last3=Zilian|first3=H. G.|date=1975-12-31|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9789027706003|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during these years that she first encountered the work of the ethnomethodologically-inclined sociologist [[Aaron Cicourel]], specifically "Method and measurement in sociology."

From 1976-77, Knorr-Cetina received a [[Ford Foundation]] Fellowship to study at the Institute for the Study of Social Change at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Shortly before her arrival in California, the French philosopher-turned-sociologist [[Bruno Latour]] and British sociologist [[Steve Woolgar|Steven Woolgar]] began their well known "laboratory studies" at the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies|Salk Institute]] in southern California. Korr-Cetina's work at Berkeley ultimately contributed to this network of laboratory studies in the late 1970s, which would eventually become the field of the [[Social Studies of Science and Technology]]. The empirical research conducted while at Berkeley also became her widely-cited 1981 publication ''The Manufacture of Knowledge: An Essay on the Constructivist and Contextual Nature of Science''. Knorr-Cetina also received her Habilitation in sociology at the [[University of Bielefeld]] in 1981, and served as Professor of Sociology at Bielefeld from 1983 to 2001. Her work in the social studies of science during these years culminated in her widely-cited book ''Epistemic Cultures: How the Sciences Make Knowledge,'' published in 1999.

Knorr-Cetina's progression to understanding how technology mediates sociality led her to select global financial markets as a new "laboratory" to study knowledge in society. The first suggestion of this new field site was in the article "Sociality with objects: Social relations in postsocial knowledge societies" (1997), followed later by a conference on "The Status of the Object in Social Science" at Brunel University in September 1999. The paper she presented at this conference, entitled "The Market as an Object of Attachment: Exploring Postsocial Relations in Financial Markets", was later published in 2000. Her co-author was Urs Bruegger, a former foreign exchange dealer. The two collaborated on over a dozen articles on global financial markets.

==Sociology of Global Financial Systems==
With the turn of the century, Knorr Cetina became interested in global financial markets as an object of study. From early work with Urs Bruegger,[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3341821?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents][http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0011392102050003006] we see this developing into a strong research interest.[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1600910X.2003.9672857][https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Xv1pgZA4xH8C&amp;dq=knorr+cetina+financial&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s] This work is enhanced by the application of tools from science studies and the sociology of knowledge, for example, imagining "the market" as an object of attachment for traders or using market infrastructure (e.g. Bloomberg terminals) to see the microconstruction of the global market in the space of the local. The financial market infrastructure also comprises a "global scopic system" that integrates news and information across the world.[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1600910X.2003.9672857]

==The Synthetic Situation: Interactionism for a Global World==
Knorr Cetina’s lecture “The Synthetic Situation: Interactionism for a Global World” from 2008 is vital in rethinking past assumptions about communication and interaction order previously published by sociologists, namely [[Erving Goffman]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Knorr Cetina, Karin. "[http://ereserves.bowdoin.edu/f12/soc214/knorr_synthetic_soc214.pdf The Synthetic Situation: Interactionism for a Global World]." Lecture. Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction. Boston. 1 Aug. 2008. CBBcat.&lt;/ref&gt; In the lecture, which was eventually published in 2009, Knorr Cetina introduces and explains new concepts regarding global interaction. Although Goffman is widely published and read in these areas, much has changed since his day and Knorr Cetina conceptualized such changes.

The introduction of the “synthetic situation” is arguably one of her most important new concepts. It is defined as a situation that “…invariably includes, and may in fact be entirely constituted by, on-screen projections…”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; A synthetic situation, therefore, can manifest in many ways, both informal and formal. Examples include an online video chat, playing [[video games]] against others on the Internet or even a business deal done via [[Videoconferencing|videoconference]]. This idea can be seen as a result of the advancement in technology in recent years, and adds a new dimension to Goffman’s social situation where [[face-to-face interaction]] is required. Knorr Cetina explains the difference of the two situations by the use of surgery.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; A Goffmanian situation occurs when there is just the surgeon and the patient. A synthetic situation arises, however, when the surgeon uses technology like a scope and a screen in order to accomplish the task at hand. Without looking at the patient through the screen, the job would not be able to be done and would remain a face-to-face, social situation.

The [[portmanteau]] coinages '''kidult''',&lt;ref name=ki&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/kidult "Kidult"], Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt; '''rejuvenile''',&lt;ref name=reju&gt;[[Christopher Noxon]], ''[[Rejuvenile: Kickball, Cartoons, Cupcakes, and the Reinvention of the American Grown-up]]'', 2006, ([http://www.rejuvenile.com/index.php/pages/the_book online book preview])&lt;/ref&gt; '''adultescent'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/adultescent "Adultescent"], Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt;  refer to [[adult]]s with interests traditionally seen as suitable for [[child]]ren.

It can also have other meanings, such as a parent who enjoys being a parent due to spending quality time with their children, but is not willing to accept their more authoritarian role/responsibilities as parent.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} An example is [[Robin Williams]]' character in ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'', a father who has fun with his children but is a poor disciplinarian and is seen by his wife as an irresponsible head of the household.

In the past, [[psychology]] recognized the concept of ''[[puer aeternus]]'', or "eternal boy".{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Today, often called "[[Puer aeternus#Peter_Pan_syndrome|Peter Pan syndrome]]", it means a person remaining emotionally at that of a teenager or even a child. It is derived from the traditional archetypal "eternal boy", [[Peter Pan]].

One of the most well-known and extreme cases of Peter Pan syndrome and the kidult mentality is [[Michael Jackson]]. Michael explicitly stated that he did not want to grow up and he owned an impressive collection of arcade video games, toy cars and fantasy and sci-fi memorabilia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fameable.com/kidults-market/2228/ "Kidults, the adultescent market"], Fameable, February 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, there was reporting that for an adult to have interests traditionally expected only from children is not necessarily an anomaly.&lt;ref name=reju/&gt; The entertainment industry was quick to recognize the trend, and introduced a special category, "kidult", of things marketable for kids and adults alike.&lt;ref name=ki/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/forty-year-old-virgins-94401 "Forty-Year-Old Virgins"], by Tony Dokoupil, December 15, 2007

And unlike ''puer aeternus'', "rejuveniles" successfully marry adult responsibilities with non-adult interests.&lt;ref name=ki/&gt; When [[Christopher Noxon]] appeared on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on June 29, 2006, he remarked that "There's a big difference between childish and childlike".

In South Korea, the buzzword "kideolteu" was used in 2015, highlighting the market trend of increasing toy sales (such as drones and "electric wheels") to kidults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://besuccess.com/2015/11/drone-electricwheel/|title = 연말 유통 트랜드 분석, ‘드론, 전동휠’ 아웃도어 키덜트 제품 인기|date = 2015-11-30|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = be|first = success}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical limitarianism is an [[ethical theory]] relating to priorities of intervention where need or risk might be evident.  As the [[principle]] of [[distributive justice]] advanced by [[Ingrid Robeyns]], limitarianism states that it is morally impermissible to be (excessively) [[Wealth|rich]] (i.e. have more economic resources than a certain level).

==Types of ethical limitarianism==

'''Ethical limitarianism'''

Ethical limitarianism is an [[ethical theory]] which (1) tries to be a partial [[Explanation|account]] of [[distributive justice]], (2) which belongs within the realms of politics rather than morality, (3) which is conceived and developed at the level of non-ideal theory, (4) which relies on an instrumental justification.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/36357522/Assessing_Non-intrinsic_Limitarianism Volacu, A., Dumitru, A., Assessing Non-intrinsic Limitarianism]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is related to [[effective altruism]].

'''Democratic Limitarianism'''

Democratic Limitarianism is a [[political theory]] that [[governments]] have priority duties to 
their citizenry to protect from risk and to ensure independence from fear, and thereby it urges that government prioritize protecting its citizens against fear of death or injury from: 
* Domestic threats
* Foreign threats
* Social insecurity
* Environmental hazard
A political movement advocates this [[prioritarianism|prioritization]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://thelimitarian.wordpress.com/democratic-limitarianism-what-and-why/ Democratic Limitarianism: What and Why.  The Limitarian, Citizen 2.0 website, accessed 1/2/2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethical limitarianism of [[Ingrid Robeyns]] would contrast with this view of democratic limitarianism.

==Earlier uses of term limitarianism==
Ethical limitarianism is not to be confused with [[Christian theology|Christian theological]] limitarianism, which teaches that [[History of the Calvinist–Arminian debate|Christ's atonement]] applies only to [[the elect]] (as [[Calvinism]]), and not to all humanity (as [[Christian universalism]] taught), or of [[limited atonement]] and [[irresistible grace]] as [[St. Augustine]] had taught.

In the system of [[Term logic|Aristotelian logic]], the '''logical cube''' is a [[diagram]] representing the different ways in which each of the eight [[proposition]]s of the [[Formal system|system]] is logically related ('opposed') to each of the others.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Reichenbach, 1952, "The Syllogism revised", &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of Science&lt;/em&gt; 19(1), pp. 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  The system is also useful in the analysis of [[Term logic|syllogistic logic]], serving to identify the allowed logical conversions from one type to another.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dekker, 2015, "Not Only Barbara", &lt;em&gt;Journal of Logic, Language, and Information&lt;/em&gt; 24(2), pp. 95-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3356">A '''Lunar cycler''' or '''Earth–Moon cycler''' is an [[orbit]], or [[spacecraft]] therein, which periodically passes close by the [[Earth]] and the [[Moon]], using [[gravity assist]]s and occasional [[orbital maneuver|propellant-powered corrections]] to maintain its trajectories between the two. If the fuel required to reach a particular cycler orbit from both the Earth and the Moon is modest, and the travel time between the two along the cycler is reasonable, then having a spacecraft in the cycler can provide an efficient and regular method for space transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |authors=Kenneth D. Mease, Benjamin F. Villac, Josep M. Mondelo |collaboration=Jordi Casoliva Rodon |date=June 2008 |title=Economical Space Transportation Routes Between Earth, Moon, and Beyond |url=http://balsells.eng.uci.edu/docs/Mease-Progress-Report-June08.pdf |publisher=University of California |page=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908000130/http://balsells.eng.uci.edu/docs/Mease-Progress-Report-June08.pdf |archive-date=2014-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Buzz Aldrin]] first suggested the use of cycler orbits in 1985 for the life support equipment and logistical supplies necessary for extensive manned exploration of the Moon and Mars. He also presented his thoughts on the benefits of using cycler spacecraft at the Space 88 Symposium in Albuquerque during a panel discussion on "Approaching the Construction Problems in Space." These trajectories must have the characteristic that they can be easily targeted for either launch or destination planet and that the times between encounters yield a reasonable stay time on the destination and provide for both routine and emergency return on a fairly regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;http://cbboff.org/UCBoulderCourse/documents/LunarCyclerPaper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One of the challenges for [[NASA]]'s [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer]] (IBEX) satellite was to find a stable orbit in [[cislunar space]], a region from outside the Earth's atmosphere to just beyond the Moon's orbit. The orbit in which the satellite was originally set could only be reliably predicted for about 3 years. Within cislunar space small changes in initial conditions could lead to very different trajectories years later. Because IBEX's original orbit was often closer to the Moon than the Earth, it was regularly performing gravity assists. The uncertainties in the initial orbit conditions would cause nearly identical trajectory predictions to eventually experience different gravity assist geometries, and the slightest change in that geometry during the encounter would cause huge differences in the subsequent satellite trajectory. Some predictions would hit the Earth and others would escape the Earth–Moon system. The new orbit keeps the apogee away from the Moon, reducing its sensitivity to gravity assists. IBEX can now predict this trajectory well beyond 11 years, allowing the satellite to easily observe the Sun's full [[solar cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://astrogatorsguild.com/?p=92 |title=IBEX Lunar Synchronous Orbit |first=John |last=Carrico |date=25 June 2011 |website=The Astrogator's Guild |access-date=2016-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Léon Philippe Teisserenc de Bort''' (5 November 1855 in [[Paris]], [[France]] – 2 January 1913 in [[Cannes]], France) was a [[France|French]] [[meteorology|meteorologist]] and a pioneer in the field of [[aerology]]. Together with [[Richard Assmann]] (1845-1918), he is credited as co-discoverer of the [[stratosphere]], as both men announced their discovery during the same time period in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OlckxY7BA_0C&amp;pg=PA17] Ultraviolet radiation in the solar system By Manuel Vázquez, Arnold Hanslmeier&lt;/ref&gt; 
Teisserenc de Bort pioneered the use of unmanned instrumented [[weather balloon|balloons]] and was the first to identify the region in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] around 8-17 kilometers of height where the [[adiabatic lapse rate|lapse rate]] reaches zero, known today as the [[tropopause]].

==Early life and career==
He was the son of an engineer. He began his scientific career in 1880, when he entered the meteorological department of the Bureau Central Météorologique (Administrative Center of National Meteorology, a department of the French government) in [[Paris]] under [[Éleuthère Mascart|E. E. N. Mascart]]. In 1883, 1885 and 1887 he made journeys to [[North Africa]] to study geology and terrestrial magnetism, and during this, period published some important charts of the distribution of pressure at a height of 4,000 metres. Between 1892 and 1896, Teisserenc de Bort was chief meteorologist to the Bureau.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Teisserenc de Bort, Léon Philippe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumented balloons pioneer==
After his resignation from the Bureau in 1896, he established a private meteorological observatory in [[Trappes]] near [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]]. There he carried out investigations on clouds and the problems of the upper air. He conducted experiments with high-flying instrumented [[hydrogen]] balloons and was one of the first people to use such devices.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meteohistory.org/2004polling_preprints/docs/abstracts/fonton_abstract.pdf Teisserenc de Bort a life in Meteorology]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, Teisserenc de Bort published an important paper in ''Comptes Rendus'' detailing his researches by means of balloons into the constitution of the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;  He noticed that while the air [[temperature]] decreased steadily up to approximately 11 kilometers of height, it remained constant above that [[altitude]] (up to the highest points he could reach). In other words, he discovered an indication of a [[temperature inversion]] or at least of a zero lapse rate above this altitude. For many years he was uncertain whether he discovered a true [[physical phenomenon]] or whether his measurements suffered from a systematic [[bias]] (indeed, the first measurements ''did'' have a positive temperature bias as the instruments were liable to radiative heating by [[solar radiation]]). That is why Teisserenc de Bort carried out 200+ more balloon experiments (with a substantial part of them being held during the night to eliminate radiative heating) until 1902, when he suggested that the atmosphere was divided into two layers.

==Troposphere and stratosphere==
During the years that followed, he named the two [[Earth's atmosphere|layers of the atmosphere]] known as the "[[troposphere]]" and the "[[stratosphere]]". This naming convention has since been maintained, with (higher-altitude) layers that were subsequently discovered being given names of this sort. After Teisserenc de Bort's death in 1913, the heirs donated the observatory to the state so that the research tasks could be continued.

==Additional investigations==
He also carried out investigations in [[Sweden]] and over the [[Zuider Zee]], the [[Mediterranean]] and the tropical region of the [[Atlantic]], and fitted out a special vessel in order to study the currents above the [[trade winds]]. He was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] in 1903, honorary member in 1909, and was awarded the [[Symons Gold Medal]] of the Society in 1908. He collaborated with [[Hugo Hildebrandsson]] in ''Les bases de la météorologie dynamique'' (1907).&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;

Ancient '''[[Maya civilization|Mayan]] social classes''' included a complex relationship between elites, including kings and merchants, and commoners.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The ancient Maya|last=J.|first=Sharer, Robert|date=2006|publisher=Stanford University Press|others=Traxler, Loa P.|isbn=978-0804748162|edition= 6th|location=Stanford, Calif.|oclc=57577446}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest ancient Mayan social class included a single centralized leader known as the king or ''K'uhul ajaw,'' who was most often a man but occasionally a woman.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The king's power derived from two main sources, including religion and control over resources, and this power was reinforced by other elites, including merchants.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; This faction of ancient Mayan social classes arose when some individuals gained greater access to resources than others, increased internal and external trade, and specialized within the manufacturing and selling of goods.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; This influx of wealth for subsections of the ancient Mayan population further subdivided the upper and lower classes, and wealth became a source of power for the elites.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

== Theological Evidence ==
Classic Mayan material culture may provide possible indicators of social stratification within Classic Mayan society. Aspects of housing structure remains, such as the type of building material used during construction and the absence or presence of decoration on the outside on the structure, may indicate the occupant's social standing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hendon|first=Julia A.|date=1991|title=Status and Power in Classic Maya Society: An Theological Study|jstor=680969|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=93|issue=4|pages=894–918}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the remains of a highly decorated stone structure suggest the occupants had a higher social status than the occupants of a non-decorated thatch structure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, smaller aspects of material culture such as pottery found within structural remains provide insight into social status.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Recount|first=Lisa J.|date=2001|title=Like Water for Chocolate: Feasting and Political Ritual among the Late Classic Maya at Xunantunich, Belize|jstor=684122|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=103|issue=4|pages=935–953}}&lt;/ref&gt; A greater variety of pottery associated with ritualistic feasting is more commonly found in superstructures, which may suggest elites had better access to protein sources than non-elites.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Imported pottery fragments are more commonly found in superstructures than in typical housing structures, suggesting that the Classic Mayan elite had greater access to imported products than commoners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Burial placement and type also held great importance in Classic Mayan society. As deceased individuals were often buried under or near their homes, house construction further indicates social status.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bones of complexity : bioarchaeological case studies of social organization and skeletal biology|others=Klaus, Haagen D.,, Harvey, Amanda R.,, Cohen, Mark Nathan,, Larsen, Clark Spencer,|isbn=9780813062235|location=Gainesville|oclc=976434695|last1 = Klaus|first1 = Haagen D.|last2=Harvey|first2=Amanda R.|last3=Cohen|first3=Mark Nathan|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, other burial details, such as the type of burial and associated burial goods provide information about status. Wright and Vásquez (2017) initially classify Classic Mayan burials into commoner and elite burials, which may be further subdivided into simple graves and simple crypts for commoners, and elaborate crypts and underground chambers for members of the elite.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The presence and type of artifacts uncovered within the burial, which are referred to as grave goods, may also indicate social status and other things.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Skeletal Evidence ==
Physical remains of Mayan individuals from the Classic period may also include indicators of social standing. Nutritional diseases during life are recorded in an individual's bones, and their presence and severity differs based on access to resources, which is also related to social standing. Such nutritional diseases include dental caries or cavities in an individual's teeth.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pathology of the hard dental tissues|last=B.|first=Schuurs, A. H.|date=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781405153652|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|oclc=813166790}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavities form when bacteria in the mouth metabolize sugars from carbohydrates and demineralize the enamel of a tooth.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; An individual with an easily accessible carbohydrate-rich diet will be more likely to have more cavities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cucina Andrea|first=Tiesler Vera|date=2003|title=Dental caries and antemortem tooth loss in the northern Peten area, Mexico: a biocultural perspective on social status among the Classic Maya|url=|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=122|issue=1|pages=1–10|via=|pmid=12923899|doi=10.1002/ajpa.10267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using burial location as a proxy for social status, Cucina and Tiesler (2003) found that cavities were more common in elite Classic Mayan individuals than non-elite individuals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They also found that there were more cavities in elite females than elite males, suggesting there may have been an additional barrier to resource access based on sex,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; although this difference may also highlight the role of [[estrogen]] in cavity formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferraro|first=Maria|last2=Vieira|first2=Alexandre R.|date=2010|title=Explaining Gender Differences in Caries: A Multifactorial Approach to a Multifactorial Disease|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijd/2010/649643/|journal=International Journal of Dentistry|language=en|volume=2010|pages=1–5|doi=10.1155/2010/649643|pmid=20339488|pmc=2840374|issn=1687-8728}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cucina and Tiesler (2003) did not find a meaningful difference in the number of cavities found in non-elite males and females, providing counter evidence to this argument.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Due to the more complete preservation of elite skeletal remains than non-elite skeletal remains based on burial practices, it can be difficult to represent non-elite individuals who compromised 90% of ancient Mayan society.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5417">The '''National Association of Testing Authorities''', Australia ('''NATA''') was established in 1947 in response to a call for the formation of a national testing services body to ensure the [[munition]]s which the government was manufacturing during the [[Second World War]] met a sufficiently high standard.  

NATA is a private [[not-for-profit]] company, governed by a Board that has representation from its members, and from industry, government and professional bodies.

In 1988, NATA's role as an accreditation body was recognised by the [[Australian Government]] in a [[Memorandum of Understanding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/11-regulating-access-genetic-testing/laboratory-accreditation#_ftn4/|title=Regulating Access to Genetic Testing-Laboratory accreditation |publisher= Australian Law Reform Commission |accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was renewed in 2014.

Its head office is situated in [[Rhodes, New South Wales]] and it has offices in four other capital cities of Australia. It employs 180 staff and over three thousand volunteer technical experts who assist NATA in the assessment of facilities and on its various technical committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nata.com.au/nata/about-nata/  |title=About NATA |publisher= National Association of Testing Authorities, Australia |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
NATA provides accreditation services to inspection bodies and producers of certified reference materials. It offers both "traditional" testing programs and "specialised" programs in areas such as medical&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/genomics/policy/nata/en/|title=Quality and Safety in Genetic Testing: An Emerging Concern |publisher= World Health Organization |accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and veterinary testing, [[forensic science]], [[medical imaging]], reference material production and proficiency testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nata.com.au/nata/accreditation-info/types-of-accreditation/ |title=Types of Accreditation |publisher= National Association of Testing Authorities, Australia |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NATA monitors members' compliance with the [[OECD]] Principles of [[Good Laboratory Practice]] (GLP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.trilab.com.au/about-trilab/nata-accreditation/ |title=NATA Accreditation |publisher= Trilab Laboratory |accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
NATA formally recognises whether facilities produce reliable technical results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.attar.com.au/ckfinder/userfiles/files/What%20NATA%20Accreditation%20Means.pdf |title=What is NATA Accreditation to ISO 17025 and What Does It Mean? |publisher= Advanced Technology Testing and Research |accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International activities==
NATA represents Australia in a number of high-level International fora related to laboratory, inspection body, reference material producer and proficiency testing service provider accreditation practices and policies.

NATA represents Australia through:
*the establishment of mutual recognition arrangements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.aplac.org/aplac_mra.html/ |title=APLAC Mutual Recognition Arrangement |publisher= Asia Pacific Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation |accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with other accreditation bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ilac.org/signatory-detail/?id=6 |title=ILAC MRA Signatory contact details: National Association of Testing Authorities, Australia |publisher=International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*holding Designating Authority status for laboratory and inspection body recognition from the [[Commonwealth Government]]
*the provision of input to a number of international committees, and to the development of the standards [[ISO/IEC 17025]] (for testing and [[calibration]] laboratories), [[ISO 15189]] (for medical laboratories) and [[ISO 17011]] (for accreditation bodies)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nata.com.au/nata/about-nata/international/nata-s-international-activities-and-role/ |title=NATA’s International Activities and Role |publisher= National Association of Testing Authorities, Australia |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Noble Eightfold Path''' ([[Pali]]: {{lang|pi|{{IAST|ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo}}}}; [[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|{{IAST|āryāṣṭāṅgamārga}}}})&lt;ref&gt;Brekke, Torkel. "The Religious Motivation of the Early Buddhists." Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Vol. 67, No. 4 (Dec., 1999), p. 860&lt;/ref&gt; is an early summary of the path of Buddhist practices leading to [[Moksha|liberation]] from [[samsara]], the painful cycle of [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].{{Sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=81-83}}{{sfn|Anderson|2013|pp=64-65}}

The Eightfold Path consists of eight practices: right view, right resolve, right speech, right conduct, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right ''[[samadhi]]'' ('meditative absorption or union').{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=11-14}} In early Buddhism, these practices started with understanding that the body-mind works in a corrupted way (right view), followed by entering the Buddhist path of self-observance, self-restraint, and cultivating kindness and compassion; and culminating in ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]]'' or ''samadhi'', which re-inforces these practices for the development of the body-mind.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Gethin|1992}}{{sfn|Gethin|2004}}{{sfn|Arbel|2017}} In later Buddhism, insight (''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|Prajñā]]'') became the central soteriological instrument, leading to a different concept and structure of the path,{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} in which the "goal" of the Buddhist path came to be specified as ending ignorance and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].{{sfn|Raju|1985|p=147–151}}{{sfn|Eliot|2014|p=39–41}}{{sfn|Harvey|2016|p=253–255}}{{sfn|Anderson|2013|pp=64-65}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=1-13}}{{Sfn|Paul Williams|Anthony Tribe|Alexander Wynne|2012|p=52}}

The Noble Eightfold Path is one of the principal [[Dharma (Buddhism)|teachings]] of [[Theravada Buddhism]], taught to lead to ''[[Arhatship]]''.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Univ.

Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-55394-6|pages=123–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Theravada tradition, this path is also summarized as ''[[sila (Buddhism)|sila]]'' (morality), ''samadhi'' (meditation) and ''prajna'' (insight).

In Buddhist symbolism, the Noble Eightfold Path is often represented by means of the [[dharma wheel]] (dharmachakra), in which its eight spokes represent the eight elements of the path.

== Etymology and nomenclature ==
The Pali term ''{{IAST|ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo}}'' ({{lang-sa|arya astanga marga|script=Latn}}) is typically translated in English as "Noble Eightfold Path". This translation is a convention started by the early translators of Buddhist texts into English, just like ''ariya sacca'' is translated as [[Four Noble Truths]].{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}{{Sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2003|p=66}} However, the phrase does not mean the path is noble, rather that the path is {{em|of the noble people}} ({{lang-pi|arya|script=Latn}} meaning 'enlightened, noble, precious people').{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=52}} The term ''maggo'' (Sanskrit: ''marga'') means "path", while ''aṭṭhaṅgiko'' means "eightfold". Thus, an alternate rendering of ''ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo'' is "eightfold path of the noble ones",{{sfn|Anderson|2013|pp=64-65}}{{Sfn| Buswell|2004|p=296}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche |title=Everyday Consciousness and Primordial Awareness |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g0FCCNiVsA8C |year=2007|publisher=Snow Lion |isbn=978-1-55939-973-9 |pages=80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "eightfold Aryan Path".&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p695" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mkhas-grub Dge-legs-dpal-bzaṅ-po|author2=José Ignacio Cabezón |title=A Dose of Emptiness: An Annotated Translation of the sTong thun chen mo of mKhas grub dGe legs dpal bzang |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KqnpqRajPEC |year=1992|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-0729-5 |pages=214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chögyam Trungpa |title=The Heart of the Buddha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BdCjGgmMJcoC  |year=2010|publisher=Shambhala Publications |isbn=978-0-8348-2125-5 |pages=119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All eight elements of the Path begin with the word ''samyañc'' (in Sanskrit) or ''sammā'' (in Pāli) which means "right, proper, as it ought to be, best".&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p695"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids |author2=William Stede |title=Pali-English Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC |year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1144-7 |pages=695–696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist texts contrast ''samma'' with its opposite ''miccha''.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p695" /&gt;

== The Eightfold Path ==
=== Origin ===
{{See also|Buddhist paths to awakening}}

According to Indologist Tilmann Vetter, the description of the Buddhist path may initially have been as simple as the term ''the middle way''.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} In time, this short description was elaborated, resulting in the description of the eightfold path.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} Tilmann Vetter and historian Rod Bucknell both note that longer descriptions of "the path" can be found in the early texts, which can be condensed into the eightfold path.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Bucknell|1984}}{{refn|group=note|One of those longer sequences, from the ''CulaHatthipadopama-sutta'', the "Lesser Discourse on the Simile of the Elephant's Footprints", is as follows:{{sfn|Bucknell|1984|p=11-12}}
# ''Dhammalsaddhalpabbajja'': A layman hears a Buddha teach the Dhamma, comes to have faith in him, and decides to take ordination as a monk;
# ''sila'': He adopts the moral precepts;
# ''indriyasamvara'': He practises "guarding the six sense-doors";
# ''sati-sampajanna'': He practises mindfulness and self-possession (actually described as mindfulness of the body, kāyānussatti);
# ''jhana 1'': He finds an isolated spot in which to meditate, purifies his mind of the hindrances (nwarana), and attains the first rupa-jhana;
# ''jhana 2'': He attains the second jhana;
# ''jhana 3'': He attains the third jhana;
# ''jhana 4'': He attains the fourth jhana;
# ''pubbenivasanussati-nana'': he recollects his many former existences in samsara;
# ''sattanam cutupapata-nana'': he observes the death and rebirth of beings according to their karmas;
# ''dsavakkhaya-nana'': He brings about the destruction of the dsavas (cankers), and attains a profound realization of (as opposed to mere knowledge about) the four noble truths;
# ''vimutti'': He perceives that he is now liberated, that he has done what was to be done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A similar sequence can be found in the [[Samaññaphala Sutta|Sāmaññaphala-sutta]].&lt;ref name="Gethin2008_p142"/&gt;}}

The eight Buddhist practices in the Noble Eightfold Path are:{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12-13}}{{refn|group=note|See also Majjhima Nikaya 44, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.044.than.html Culavedalla Sutta]}}
# Right View: our actions have consequences, death is not the end, and our actions and beliefs have consequences after death.

# Right Resolve or Intention: the giving up home and adopting the life of a religious mendicant in order to follow the path; this concept aims at peaceful renunciation, into an environment of non-sensuality, non-ill-will (to loving kindness), away from cruelty (to compassion).{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83}} Such an environment aids contemplation of [[anicca|impermanence]], [[dukkha|suffering]], and [[anatta|non-Self]].{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83}}
# Right Speech: no lying, no rude speech, no telling one person what another says about him.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12-13}}
# Right Conduct or Action: no killing or injuring, no taking what is not given, no sexual acts, no material desires.{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12-13}}
# Right Livelihood: beg to feed, only possessing what is essential to sustain life;{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12-13}}
# Right Effort: preventing the arising of [[Five hindrances|unwholesome states]], and generating [[seven factors of awakening|wholesome states]], the ''[[seven factors of awakening|bojjhagā]]'' (seven factors of awakening). This includes ''indriya-samvara'', "guarding the sense-doors," restraint of the sense faculties.&lt;ref name="Analayo2013"/&gt;{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83}}
# Right Mindfulness (''[[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]]''; ''[[Satipatthana]]''; ''[[Sampajañña]]''): "retention," being mindful of the ''dhammas'' ("teachings," "elements") that are beneficial to the Buddhist path.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=942-943}}{{refn|group=note|According to Frauwallner, mindfulness was a means to prevent the arising of craving, which resulted simply from contact between the senses and their objects; this may have been the Buddha’s original idea;{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=45}} compare [[Buddhadasa]], ''Heartwood of the Bodhi-tree'', on [[Pratītyasamutpāda]]; and Grzegorz Polak (2011), ''Reexamining Jhana: Towards a Critical Reconstruction of Early Buddhist Soteriology'', p.153-156, 196-197.}} In the [[vipassana movement]], ''sati'' is interpreted as "bare attention": never be absent minded, being conscious of what one is doing;{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=941}} this encourages the awareness of the impermanence of body, feeling and mind, as well as to experience the five aggregates (''[[skandha]]s''), the [[five hindrances]], the four True Realities and seven factors of awakening.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83}}
# Right ''[[samadhi]]'' (''[[Passaddhi]]''; ''[[Ekaggata]]''; ''sampasadana''): practicing four stages of ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]'' ("meditation"), which includes ''samadhi'' proper in the second stage, and reinforces the development of the ''[[seven factors of awakening|bojjhagā]]'', culminating into ''[[upekkha]]'' (equanimity) and mindfulness.{{sfn|Polak|2011}}{{sfn|Arbel|2017}}. In the Theravada tradition and the Vipassana movement, this is interpreted as ''[[ekaggata]]'', concentration or one-pointedness of the mind, and supplemented with ''[[Vipassana]]''-meditation, which aims at insight.

=== Liberation ===
Following the Noble Eightfold Path leads to [[Moksha|liberation]] in the form of [[nirvana]]:{{Sfn|Lopez|2009|p=136-137}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen J.

=== Threefold division ===
The Noble Eightfold Path is sometimes divided into [[Three disciplines of Buddhism|three basic divisions]], as follows:{{sfn|Prebish|2000|p=40}}

|-
|}

This order is a later development, when discriminating insight (''prajna'') became central to Buddhist soteriology, and came to be regarded as the culmination of the Buddhist path.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=13}} Yet, Majjhima Nikaya 117, ''Mahācattārīsaka Sutta'', describes the first seven practices as requisites for right samadhi. According to Vetter, this may have been the original soteriological practice in early Buddhism.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}

"[[Buddhist ethics|Moral virtues]]" (Sanskrit: ''[[śīla]]'', Pāli: ''sīla'') group consists of three paths: right speech, right action and right livelihood.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83-84}} The word ''śīla'' though translated by English writers as linked to "morals or ethics", states Bhikkhu Bodhi, is in ancient and medieval Buddhist commentary tradition closer to the concept of discipline and disposition that "leads to harmony at several levels&amp;nbsp;– social, psychological, karmic and contemplative".{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=47-48}} Such harmony creates an environment to pursue the meditative steps in the Noble Eightfold Path by reducing social disorder, preventing inner conflict that result from transgressions, favoring future karma-triggered movement through better rebirths, and purifying the mind.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=47-48}}{{Sfn|Spiro|1982|p=44-48}}

The meditation group ("samadhi") of the path progresses from moral restraints to training the mind.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=65}}{{Sfn|Spiro|1982|p=44-53}} Right effort and mindfulness calm the mind-body complex, releasing unwholesome states and habitual patterns and encouraging the development of wholesome states and non-automatic responses, the ''[[seven factors of awakening|bojjhagā]]'' (seven factors of awakening). The practice of ''dhyana'' reinforces these developments, leading to ''[[upekkha]]'' (equanimity) and mindfulness.{{sfn|Polak|2011}}{{sfn|Arbel|2017}} According to the Theravada commentarial tradition and the contemporary Vipassana movement, the goal in this group of the Noble Eightfold Path is to develop clarity and insight into the nature of reality&amp;nbsp;– ''[[dukkha]]'', ''[[anicca]]'' and ''[[anatta]]'', discard negative states and dispel ''[[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidya]]'' (ignorance), ultimately attaining ''[[nirvana]]''.&lt;ref name=trainor2004p74&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Trainor |title=Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PrloTKuAjwC |year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-517398-7 |pages=74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the threefold division, ''prajna'' (insight, wisdom) is presented as the culmination of the path, whereas in the eightfold division the path starts with correct knowledge or insight, which is needed to understand why this path should be followed.{{sfn|Anderson|2013}}

=== Tenfold Path ===
In the ''Mahācattārīsaka Sutta''&lt;ref name=BMaha /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T02/0099_028.htm|title=Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 2, No. 99, Sutra 785|accessdate=28 October 2008|publisher=Cbeta|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923211023/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T02/0099_028.htm|archive-date=23 September 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which appears in the Chinese and Pali canons, the Buddha explains that cultivation of the noble eightfold path of a learner leads to the development of two further paths of the Arahants, which are right knowledge, or insight (''sammā-ñāṇa''), and right liberation, or release (''sammā-vimutti'').{{Sfn|Choong|2000|p=141}} These two factors fall under the category of wisdom (''paññā'').{{Sfn|Fuller|2005|p=55-56}}

The Noble Eightfold Path, in the Buddhist traditions, is the direct means to nirvana and brings a release from the cycle of life and death in the realms of samsara.{{Sfn|Lopez|1995|p=159}}{{Sfn| Hirakawa|1990|p=41}}

== Further explanation ==
=== Right view ===
{{See also|View (Buddhism)}}
"Right view" (''{{IAST|samyak-dṛṣṭi}}'' / ''{{IAST|sammā-diṭṭhi}}'') or "right understanding"{{sfn|Gunaratana|2001|p=11}} explicates that our actions have consequences, that death is not the end, that our actions and beliefs also have consequences after death, and that the Buddha followed and taught a successful path out of this world and [[Buddhist cosmology|the other world]] (heaven and underworld or hell).{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12; 77-79}}{{sfn|Velez de Cea|2013|p=54}}{{sfn|Wei-hsün Fu|Wawrytko|1994|p=194}}&lt;ref name="vgweb.org" /&gt; [[Majjhima Nikaya]] 117, ''Mahācattārīsaka Sutta'', a text from the [[Pāli Canon]], describes the first seven practices as requisites of right samadhi, starting with right view:
{{quote|Of those, right view is the forerunner [...] And what is the right view with effluents, siding with merit, resulting in acquisitions? 'There is what is given, what is offered, what is sacrificed.{{refn|group=note|Vetter translates it as "offering into the fire".{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12 with footnote 4}}}} There are fruits, and results of good and bad actions. There is this world and the next world. There is mother and father. There are spontaneously reborn beings; there are contemplatives and brahmans who faring rightly and practicing rightly, proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselves.' This is the right view with effluents, siding with merit, resulting in acquisitions.&lt;ref name=BMaha /&gt;{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12 with footnote 4}}}}

Later on, right view came to explicitly include ''[[karma]]'' and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], and the importance of the [[Four Noble Truths]], when "insight" became central to Buddhist soteriology.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=77}} This presentation of right view still plays an essential role in Theravada Buddhism.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83-84}}

The purpose of right view is to clear one's path from confusion, misunderstanding, and deluded thinking. It is a means to gain right understanding of reality.&lt;ref name=Chryssides249&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Chryssides |author2=Margaret Wilkins |title=A Reader in New Religious Movements  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwP--c7OV4cC |year=2006|publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=978-0-8264-6167-4 |pages=248–249 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interpretation of some Buddhist movements, state Religion Studies scholar George Chryssides and author Margaret Wilkins, right view is non-view: as the enlightened become aware that nothing can be expressed in fixed conceptual terms and rigid, dogmatic clinging to concepts is discarded.&lt;ref name=Chryssides249 /&gt;

==== Theravada ====
Right View can be further subdivided, states translator Bhikkhu Bodhi, into mundane right view and superior or supramundane right view:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html#ch2 |title=The Noble Eightfold Path: The Way to the End of Suffering |accessdate=10 July 2010|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Bhikkhu Bodhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Fuller|2005|p=56}}
# Mundane right view, knowledge of the fruits of good behavior. Having this type of view will bring merit and will support the favourable rebirth of the sentient being in the realm of [[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]].
# Supramundane (world-transcending) right view, the understanding of karma and rebirth, as implicated in the [[Four Noble Truths]],  leading to awakening and liberation from rebirths and associated [[dukkha]] in the realms of samsara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bhikkhu Bodhi|title=In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFiGGao0GWoC|year=2005|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-996-9|pages=147, 446 with note 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83-84}}

According to Theravada Buddhism, mundane right view is a teaching that is suitable for lay followers, while supramundane right view, which requires a deeper understanding, is suitable for monastics. Mundane and supramundane right view involve accepting the following doctrines of Buddhism:{{sfn|Richard Gombrich|2009|p=27-28, 103-109}}{{Sfn|Keown|2000|p=59, 96-97}}
# [[Karma in Buddhism|Karma]]: Every action of body, speech, and mind has [[karma|karmic]] results, and influences the kind of future rebirths and realms a being enters into.
# [[Three marks of existence]]: everything, whether physical or mental, is impermanent (''anicca''), a source of suffering (''dukkha''), and lacks a self (''anatta'').
# The [[Four Noble Truths]] are a means to gaining insights and ending ''dukkha''.

=== Right resolve ===
Right resolve (''samyak-saṃkalpa'' / ''sammā saṅkappa'') can also be known as "right thought", "right intention",  or "right aspiration". In this factor, the practitioner resolves to leave home, renounce the worldly life and dedicate himself to an ascetic pursuit.{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12-13}}{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83-84}} In section III.248, the Majjhima Nikaya states,
{{quote|And what is right resolve? Being resolved on renunciation, on freedom from ill will, on harmlessness: This is called right resolve.&lt;ref name="Bsaccavi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.141.than.html |title=Saccavibhanga Sutta |publisher=Access to Insight |author=Thanissaro Bhikkhu|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Like right view, this factor has two levels. At the mundane level, the resolve includes being harmless ([[ahimsa]]) and refraining from ill will (''avyabadha'') to any being, as this accrues karma and leads to rebirth.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83-84}}&lt;ref name=keownprebish333 /&gt; At the supramundane level, the factor includes a resolve to consider everything and everyone as impermanent, a source of suffering and without a Self.&lt;ref name=keownprebish333&gt;{{cite book|author1=Damien Keown |author2=Charles S. Prebish |title=Encyclopedia of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFpcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-98588-1 |pages=333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right speech ===
Right speech (''samyag-vāc'' / ''sammā-vācā'') in most Buddhist texts is presented as four abstentions, such as in the Pali Canon thus:&lt;ref name=BMaha /&gt;&lt;ref name="BSac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.141.than.html |title=Saccavibhanga Sutta |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |author=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|And what is right speech? Abstaining from lying, from divisive speech, from abusive speech, and from idle chatter: This is called right speech.}}

Instead of the usual "abstention and refraining from wrong" terminology,{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=47-48}} a few texts such as the Samaññaphala Sutta and Kevata Sutta in ''Digha Nikaya'' explain this virtue in an active sense, after stating it in the form of an abstention.&lt;ref name= Samannaphala&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html |title=Samaññaphala Sutta | publisher=Access to Insight |author=Thanissaro Bhikkhu|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Samaññaphala Sutta states that a part of a monk's virtue is that "he abstains from false speech. He speaks the truth, holds to the truth, is firm, reliable, no deceiver of the world."&lt;ref name= Samannaphala /&gt; Similarly, the virtue of abstaining from divisive speech is explained as delighting in creating concord.&lt;ref name= Samannaphala /&gt; The virtue of abstaining from abusive speech is explained in this Sutta to include affectionate and polite speech that is pleasing to people. The  virtue of abstaining from idle chatter is explained as speaking what is connected with the Dhamma goal of his liberation.&lt;ref name= Samannaphala /&gt;{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83-84}}

In the ''Abhaya-raja-kumara Sutta'', the Buddha explains the virtue of right speech in different scenarios, based on its truth value, utility value and emotive content.{{Sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=105}}&lt;ref name=abhayasutta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.058.than.html |title=Abhaya Sutta|accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Tathāgata|Tathagata]]'', states Abhaya Sutta, never speaks anything that is unfactual or factual, untrue or true, disagreeable or agreeable, if that is unbeneficial and unconnected to his goals.&lt;ref name=abhayasutta /&gt;{{Sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=50-52}} Further, adds Abhaya Sutta, the ''Tathagata'' speaks the factual, the true, if in case it is disagreeable and unendearing, only if it is beneficial to his goals, but with a sense of proper time.&lt;ref name=abhayasutta /&gt;{{Sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=50-52}} Additionally, adds Abhaya Sutta, the ''Tathagata'', only speaks with a sense of proper time even when what he speaks is the factual, the true, the agreeable, the endearing and what is beneficial to his goals.&lt;ref name=abhayasutta /&gt;{{Sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=50-52}}&lt;ref name="Ganeri2007p47"&gt;{{cite book|author=J Ganeri  |title=The Concealed Art of the Soul: Theories of Self and Practices of Truth in Indian Ethics and Epistemology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5dITDAAAQBAJ |year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-920241-6|pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha thus explains right speech in the Pali Canon, according to Ganeri, as never speaking something that is not beneficial; and, only speaking what is true and beneficial, "when the circumstances are right, whether they are welcome or not".&lt;ref name="Ganeri2007p47" /&gt;

=== Right action ===
Right action (''samyak-karmānta'' / ''sammā-kammanta'') is like right speech, expressed as abstentions but in terms of bodily action. In the Pali Canon, this path factor is stated as:
{{quote|And what is right action? Abstaining from killing, abstaining from stealing, abstaining from sexual misconduct. This is called right action.&lt;ref name=bucknellkangp12&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roderick Bucknell |author2=Chris Kang |title=The Meditative Way: Readings in the Theory and Practice of Buddhist Meditation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSaOAQAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-80408-3 |pages=12–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The prohibition on killing precept in Buddhist scriptures applies to all living beings, states Christopher Gowans, not just human beings.&lt;ref name="Gowans2004p177"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Gowans |title=Philosophy of the Buddha: An Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EbU4Hd5lro0C |year=2004|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-46973-4 |pages=177–178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhikkhu Bodhi agrees, clarifying that the more accurate rendering of the Pali canon is a prohibition on "taking life of any sentient being", which includes human beings, animals, birds, insects but excludes plants because they are not considered sentient beings.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=57-58}} Further, adds Bodhi, this precept refers to ''intentional'' killing, as well as any form of intentional harming or torturing any sentient being.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=57-58}} This moral virtue in early Buddhist texts, both in context of harm or killing of animals and human beings, is similar to ''ahimsa'' precepts found in the texts particularly of Jainism as well as of Hinduism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Purusottama Bilimoria|author2=Joseph Prabhu|author3=Renuka M.

The prohibition on stealing in the Pali Canon is an abstention from intentionally taking what is not voluntarily offered by the person to whom that property belongs.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=58-59}} This includes, states Bhikkhu Bodhi, taking by stealth, by force, by fraud or by deceit.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=59-60}} Both the intention and the act matters, as this precept is grounded on the impact on one's karma.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=59-60}}

The prohibition on sexual misconduct in the Noble Eightfold Path, states Tilmann Vetter, refers to "not performing sexual acts".{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12}} This virtue is more generically explained in the ''Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta'', which teaches that one must abstain from all sensual misconduct, including getting sexually involved with someone unmarried (anyone protected by parents or by guardians or by siblings), and someone married (protected by husband), and someone betrothed to another person, and female convicts  or by ''dhamma''.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=60-62}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.176.than.html |title=Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For monastics, the abstention from sensual misconduct means strict celibacy, states Christopher Gowans, while for lay Buddhists this prohibits adultery as well as other forms of sensual misconduct.&lt;ref name="Emmanuel2015p440"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Gowans |editor=Steven M.

=== Right livelihood ===
Right livelihood (''samyag-ājīva'' / ''sammā-ājīva'') precept is mentioned in many early Buddhist texts, such as the ''Mahācattārīsaka Sutta'' in ''Majjhima Nikaya'' as follows:&lt;ref name=BMaha /&gt;
{{quote|"And what is right livelihood? Right livelihood, I tell you, is of two sorts: There is right livelihood with effluents, siding with merit, resulting in acquisitions; there is right livelihood that is noble, without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path.

"And what is the right livelihood with effluents, siding with merit, resulting in acquisitions? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones abandons wrong livelihood and maintains his life with right livelihood. This is the right livelihood with effluents, siding with merit, resulting in acquisitions.

"And what is the right livelihood that is noble, without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path? The abstaining, desisting, abstinence, avoidance of wrong livelihood in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble, whose mind is without effluents, who is fully possessed of the noble path. (...)}}

The early canonical texts state right livelihood as avoiding and abstaining from wrong livelihood. This virtue is further explained in Buddhist texts, states Vetter, as "living from begging, but not accepting everything and not possessing more than is strictly necessary".{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12}} For lay Buddhists, states Harvey, this precept requires that the livelihood avoid causing suffering to sentient beings by cheating them, or harming or killing them in any way.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83}}

The Anguttara Nikaya III.208, states Harvey, asserts that the right livelihood does not trade in weapons, living beings, meat, alcoholic drink or poison.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=83}}{{Sfn|Rahula|2007|p=53}} The same text, in section V.177, asserts that this applies to lay Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martine Batchelor|title=The Spirit of the Buddha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fL3mykqlOJcC&amp;pg=PT59 |year=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-17500-4 |pages=59 }}; Quote: These five trades, O monks, should not be taken up by a lay follower: trading with weapons, trading in living beings, trading in meat, trading in intoxicants, trading in poison."&lt;/ref&gt; This has meant, states Harvey, that raising and trading cattle livestock for slaughter is a breach of "right livelihood" precept in the Buddhist tradition, and Buddhist countries lack the mass slaughter houses found in Western countries.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=273-274}}

=== Right effort ===
{{See also|Four Right Efforts|Viriya}}

Right effort (''samyag-vyāyāma'' / ''sammā-vāyāma'') is preventing the arising of [[Five hindrances|unwholesome states]], and the generation of [[Seven factors of awakening|wholesome states]]. This includes ''indriya-samvara'', "guarding the sense-doors," restraint of the sense faculties.&lt;ref name="Analayo2013"&gt;Analayo (2013), ''Satipatthana'', Windhorse Publications: "... sense-restraint, which in fact constitues an aspect of right effort."&lt;/ref&gt; Right effort presented in the Pali Canon, such as the ''Sacca-vibhanga Sutta'' as follows:&lt;ref name="BSac" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bucknellkangp12 /&gt;
{{quote|And what is right effort?&lt;br /&gt;
Here the monk arouses his will, puts forth effort, generates energy, exerts his mind, and strives to prevent the arising of evil and unwholesome mental states that have not yet arisen.&lt;br /&gt;
He arouses his will... and strives to eliminate evil and unwholesome mental states that have already arisen. He arouses his will... and strives to generate wholesome mental states that have not yet arisen.&lt;br /&gt;
He arouses his will, puts forth effort, generates energy, exerts his mind, and strives to maintain wholesome mental states that have already arisen, to keep them free of delusion, to develop, increase, cultivate, and perfect them.&lt;br /&gt;
This is called right effort.}}

The unwholesome states (''akusala'') are described in the Buddhist texts, as those relating to thoughts, emotions, intentions, and these include ''pancanivarana'' ([[five hindrances]])&amp;nbsp;– sensual thoughts, doubts about the path, restlessness, drowsiness, and ill will of any kind.{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|p=12}}{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=67-68}} Of these, the Buddhist traditions consider sensual thoughts and ill will needing more right effort. Sensual desire that must be eliminated by effort includes anything related to sights, sounds, smells, tastes and touch.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=69-75}} This is to be done by restraint of the sense faculties (''indriya-samvara''). Ill will that must be eliminated by effort includes any form of aversion including hatred, anger, resentment towards anything or anyone.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=69-75}}

=== Right mindfulness ===
{{Main|Mindfulness (Buddhism)}}
{{See also|Sampajañña|Dhamma vicaya|Satipatthana|Anapanasati|Satipatthana Sutta}}

In the [[vipassana movement]], mindfulness (''{{IAST|samyak-smṛti}}'' / ''sammā-sati'') is interpreted as "bare attention": never be absent minded, being conscious of what one is doing.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=941}} Yet, originally it has the meaning of "retention," being mindfull of the ''dhammas'' ("teachings," "elements") that are beneficial to the Buddhist path.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=942-943}} According to Frauwallner, mindfulness was a means to prevent the arising of craving, which resulted simply from contact between the senses and their objects. According to Frauwallner this may have been the Buddha's original idea.{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=45}} According to Trainor, mindfulness aids one not to crave and cling to any transitory state or thing, by complete and constant awareness of phenomena as impermanent, suffering and without self.&lt;ref name=trainor2004p74 /&gt; 

The ''[[Satipatthana Sutta]]'' describes the contemplation of [[Satipatthana|four domains]], namely body, feelings, mind and phenomena.{{refn|group=note|The formula is repeated in other sutras, for example the ''Sacca-vibhanga Sutta'' (MN 141): "And what is right mindfulness?&lt;br /&gt;Here the monk remains contemplating the body as body, resolute, aware and mindful, having put aside worldly desire and sadness;&lt;br /&gt;he remains contemplating feelings as feelings;&lt;br /&gt;he remains contemplating mental states as mental states;&lt;br /&gt;he remains contemplating mental objects as mental objects, resolute, aware and mindful, having put aside worldly desire and sadness;&lt;br /&gt;This is called right mindfulness."&lt;ref name="BSac" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bucknellkangp12 /&gt;}} The ''Satipatthana Sutta'' is regarded by the Vipassana movement as the quintessential text on Buddhist meditation, taking ques from it on "bare attention" and the contemplation on the observed phenomena as ''[[dukkha]]'', ''[[anatta]]'' and ''[[anicca]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.

According to Polak, the four ''upassanā'' do not refer to four different foundations of which one should be aware, but are an alternate description of the ''jhanas'', describing how the ''samskharas'' are tranquilized:{{sfn|Polak|2011|p=153-156, 196-197}}
* the [[Ayatana|six sense-bases]] which one needs to be aware of (''kāyānupassanā''); 
* contemplation on [[vedanā]]s, which arise with the contact between the senses and their objects (''vedanānupassanā'');
* the altered states of mind to which this practice leads (''cittānupassanā'');
* the development from the [[five hindrances]]  to the [[seven factors of enlightenment]] (''dhammānupassanā'').{{refn|group=note|Note how ''kāyānupassanā'', ''vedanānupassanā'', and ''cittānupassanā'', resemble the [[Skandha|five skandhas]] and the chain of causation as described in the middle part of [[Pratītyasamutpāda]]; while ''dhammānupassanā'' refers to mindfulness as retention, calling into mind the beneficial ''dhammas'' which are applied to analyse phenomena, and counter the arising of disturbing thoughts and emotions.}}

[[Rupert Gethin]] notes that the contemporary [[Vipassana movement]] interprets the ''Satipatthana Sutta'' as "describing a pure form of insight ([[vipassanā]]) meditation" for which ''samatha'' (calm) and ''jhāna'' are not necessary. Yet, in [[pre-sectarian Buddhism]], the establishment of mindfulness was placed before the practice of the ''jhanas'', and associated with the abandonment of the [[five hindrances]] and the entry into the first ''jhana''.&lt;ref name="Gethin2008_p142"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Gethin: "The sutta is often read today as describing a pure form of insight ([[vipassanā]]) meditation that bypasses calm ([[samatha]]) meditation and the four absorptions ([[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhāna]]), as outlined in the description of the Buddhist path found, for example, in the [[Samaññaphala Sutta|Sāmaññaphala-sutta]] [...] The earlier tradition, however, seems not to have always read it this way, associating accomplishment in the exercise of establishing mindfulness with abandoning of the [[five hindrances]] and the first absorption."&lt;ref name="Gethin2008_p142"&gt;Gethin, Rupert, Sayings of the Buddha: New Translations from the Pali Nikayas (Oxford World's Classics), 2008, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]''-scheme describes mindfulness also as appearing in the third and fourth ''dhyana'', after initial concentration of the mind.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=13}}{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=140, note 58}}{{refn|group=note|Original publication: {{Citation | last =Gombrich | first =Richard | year =2007 | title =Religious Experience in Early Buddhism | publisher =OCHS Library | url =http://www.ochs.org.uk/lectures/religious-experience-early-buddhism}}}} Gombrich and Wynne note that, while the second ''jhana'' denotes a state of absorption, in the third and fourth ''jhana'' one comes out of this absorption, being mindfully awareness of objects while being indifferent to them.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106-107; 140, note 58}}{{refn|group=note|Original publication: {{Citation | last =Gombrich | first =Richard | year =2007 | title =Religious Experience in Early Buddhism | publisher =OCHS Library | url =http://www.ochs.org.uk/lectures/religious-experience-early-buddhism}}}} According to Gombrich, "the later tradition has falsified the jhana by classifying them as the quintessence of the concentrated, calming kind of meditation, ignoring the other – and indeed higher – element.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=140, note 58}}

=== Right Concentration ===
{{Main|Dhyāna in Buddhism}}

====''Samadhi''====
''[[Samadhi]]'' (''samyak-samādhi'' / ''sammā-samādhi'') is a common practice in Indian religions. The term ''samadhi'' derives from the root sam-a-dha, which means 'to collect' or 'bring together',{{source?|date=October 2018}} and thus it is often translated as 'concentration' or 'unification of mind'. In the early Buddhist texts, samadhi is also associated with the term "[[samatha]]" (calm abiding).{{source?|date=October 2018}} In the suttas, samadhi is defined as one-pointedness of mind (''Cittass'ekaggatā'').&lt;ref&gt;Henepola Gunaratana (1995), The Jhanas in Theravada Buddhist Meditation&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhagosa]] defines samadhi as "the centering of consciousness and consciousness concomitants evenly and rightly on a single object...the state in virtue of which consciousness and its concomitants remain evenly and rightly on a single object, undistracted and unscattered."&lt;ref&gt;Visudimagga 84-85; PP.85{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, the right concentration factor is reaching a one-pointedness of mind and unifying all mental factors, but it is not the same as "a gourmet sitting down to a meal, or a soldier on the battlefield" who also experience one-pointed concentration.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=97-110}} The difference is that the latter have a one-pointed object in focus with complete awareness directed to that object&amp;nbsp;– the meal or the target, respectively. In contrast, right concentration meditative factor in Buddhism is a state of awareness without any object or subject, and ultimately unto nothingness and emptiness.{{Sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2010|p=97-110}}

====Practice====
Bronkhorst notes that neither the Four Noble Truths nor the Noble Eightfold Path discourse provide details of right ''samadhi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Bronkhorst |title=Buddhist Teaching in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mhuabeq5-cAC |year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-86171-566-4 |pages=10–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation is to be found in the Canonical texts of Buddhism, in several ''Suttas'', such as the following in ''Saccavibhanga Sutta'':&lt;ref name=BSac /&gt;&lt;ref name=bucknellkangp12 /&gt;

{{quote|And what is right concentration?

[i] Here, the monk, detached from sense-desires, detached from unwholesome states, enters and remains in the first ''jhana'' (level of concentration, Sanskrit: ''dhyāna''), in which there is applied and sustained thinking, together with joy and pleasure born of detachment;&lt;br /&gt;
[ii] And through the subsiding of applied and sustained thinking, with the gaining of inner stillness and oneness of mind, he enters and remains in the second ''jhana'', which is without applied and sustained thinking, and in which there are joy and pleasure born of concentration;&lt;br /&gt;
[iii] And through the fading of joy, he remains equanimous, mindful and aware, and he experiences in his body the pleasure of which the Noble Ones say: "equanimous, mindful and dwelling in pleasure", and thus he enters and remains in the third ''jhana'';&lt;br /&gt;
[iv] And through the giving up of pleasure and pain, and through the previous disappearance of happiness and sadness, he enters and remains in the fourth ''jhana'', which is without pleasure and pain, and in which there is pure equanimity and mindfulness.&lt;br /&gt;

Bronkhorst has questioned the historicity and chronology of the description of the four ''jhanas''. Bronkhorst states that this path may be similar to what the Buddha taught, but the details and the form of the description of the ''jhanas'' in particular, and possibly other factors, is likely the work of later scholasticism.&lt;ref name=bronkhorst2009p17&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Bronkhorst |title=Buddhist Teaching in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mhuabeq5-cAC |year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-86171-566-4 |pages=17–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Oliver Freiberger |title=Asceticism and Its Critics: Historical Accounts and Comparative Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2cbCr7M4SJ8C |year=2006| publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-971901-3|pages=249–251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronkhorst notes that description of the third ''jhana'' cannot have been formulated by the Buddha, since it includes the phrase "Noble Ones say", quoting earlier Buddhists, indicating it was formulated by later Buddists.&lt;ref name=bronkhorst2009p17 /&gt; It is likely that later Buddhist scholars incorporated this, then attributed the details and the path, particularly the insights at the time of liberation, to have been discovered by the Buddha.&lt;ref name=bronkhorst2009p17 /&gt;

====Mindfulness====
Although often translated as "concentration," as in the limiting of the attention of the mind on one object, in the fourth ''dhyana'' "equanimity and mindfulness remain,"{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=63}} and the practice of concentration-meditation may well have been incorporated from non-Buddhist traditions.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|p=53-70}} Vetter notes that ''samadhi'' consists of the four stages of dhyana meditation, but
{{quote|...to put it more accurately, the first dhyana seems to provide, after some time, a state of strong concentration, from which the other stages come forth; the second stage is called samadhija.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=13}}}}

Gombrich and Wynne note that, while the second ''jhana'' denotes a state of absorption, in the third and fourth ''jhana'' one comes out of this absorption, being mindfully awareness of objects while being indifferent to it.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106-107; 140, note 58}}{{refn|group=note|Original publication: {{Citation | last =Gombrich | first =Richard | year =2007 | title =Religious Experience in Early Buddhism | publisher =OCHS Library | url =http://www.ochs.org.uk/lectures/religious-experience-early-buddhism}}}} According to Gombrich, "the later tradition has falsified the jhana by classifying them as the quintessence of the concentrated, calming kind of meditation, ignoring the other – and indeed higher – element.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=140, note 58}}

Vetter notes that originally the path culminated in the practice of ''dhyana/samadhi'' as the core soteriological practice.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} According to the Pali and Chinese canon, the ''samadhi'' state (right concentration) is dependent on the development of preceding path factors:&lt;ref name=BMaha /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbeta.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_007.htm |title=Madhyama Agama, Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 26, sutra 31 (分別聖諦經第十一) |accessdate=28 October 2008 |publisher=Cbeta |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122103247/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_007.htm |archivedate=22 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taisho Tripitaka Vol Page 814"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0032_001.htm|title=Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 32, Page 814|accessdate=28 October 2008|publisher=Cbeta|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122092756/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0032_001.htm|archivedate=22 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The Blessed One said: "Now what, monks, is noble right concentration with its supports and requisite conditions? Any singleness of mind equipped with these seven factors&amp;nbsp;— right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness&amp;nbsp;— is called noble right concentration with its supports and requisite conditions.|Maha-cattarisaka Sutta}}

According to the discourses, right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness are used as the support and requisite conditions for the practice of right concentration. Understanding of the right view is the preliminary role, and is also the forerunner of the entire Noble Eightfold Path.&lt;ref name="BMaha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.117.than.html |title=Maha-cattarisaka Sutta|accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cbeta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_049.htm|title=Madhyama Agama, Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 26, sutra 189 (中阿含雙品 聖道經第三)|accessdate=27 October 2008|publisher=Cbeta|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122083750/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_049.htm|archive-date=22 November 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the modern Theravada ''bhikkhu'' ([[Bhikkhu|monk]]) and scholar [[Walpola Rahula]], the divisions of the noble eightfold path "are to be developed more or less simultaneously, as far as possible according to the capacity of each individual. They are all linked together and each helps the cultivation of the others."&lt;ref&gt;Rahula 46&lt;/ref&gt; Bhikkhu Bodhi explains that these factors are not sequential, but components, and "with a certain degree of progress all eight factors can be present simultaneously, each supporting the others. However, until that point is reached, some sequence in the unfolding of the path is inevitable."&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html |title=The Noble Eightfold Path: The Way to the End of Suffering|accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society |last=Bhikkhu Bodhi|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage in the Path where there is no more learning in [[Yogachara]] Abhidharma, state Buswell and Gimello, is identical to ''[[Nirvana]]'' or ''[[Buddhahood]]'', the ultimate goal in Buddhism.{{Sfn|Buswell|Gimello|1994|p=204}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rinpoche Karma-raṅ-byuṅ-kun-khyab-phrin-las|title=The Dharma: That Illuminates All Beings Impartially Like the Light of the Sun and Moon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4wVW91BLAYC |year=1986|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-156-1|pages=32–33}}; Quote: "There are various ways of examining the Complete Path. For example, we can speak of Five Paths constituting its different levels: the Path of Accumulation, the Path of Application, the Path of Seeing, the Path of Meditation and the Path of No More Learning, or Buddhahood."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender ===
According to Bernard Faure, the ancient and medieval Buddhist texts and traditions, like other religions, were almost always unfavorable or discriminatory against women, in terms of their ability to pursue Noble Eightfold Path, attain Buddhahood and nirvana.&lt;ref name="Faure2009p54"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard Faure|title=The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HidpRwrmx4AC|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-09171-6|pages=53–54, 67–70, 78–81, 99–106, }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gwilym Beckerlegge| title=The World Religions Reader| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=52E9VaEATXcC |year=2001| publisher=Routledge| isbn=978-0-415-24749-8|pages=365–370}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue of presumptions about the "female religious experience" is found in Indian texts, in translations into non-Indian languages, and in regional non-Indian commentaries written in East Asian kingdoms such as those in China, Japan and southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="Faure2009p54" /&gt; Yet, like other Indian religions, exceptions and veneration of females is found in Indian Buddhist texts, and female Buddhist deities are likewise described in positive terms and with reverence. Nevertheless, females are seen as polluted with menstruation, sexual intercourse, death and childbirth. Rebirth as a woman is seen in the Buddhist texts as a result of part of past karma, and inferior than that of a man.&lt;ref name="Faure2009p54" /&gt;

In some Chinese and Japanese Buddhist texts, the status of female deities are not presented positively, unlike the Indian tradition, states Faure.&lt;ref name="Faure2009p54" /&gt; In the Huangshinu dui Jingang (''Woman Huang explicates the Diamond Sutra''), a woman admonishes her husband about he slaughtering animals, who attacks her gender and her past karma, implying that "women go to hell" not because of her intentions nor actions (kamma), but simply because of the biology of her gender and the bodily functions over which she has no choice.&lt;ref name="Cole1994p203" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wm. Theodore de Bary|author2=Richard Lufrano|title=Sources of Chinese Tradition: Volume 2: From 1600 Through the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXEWsXaMJZYC&amp;pg=PA118|year=2010|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-51799-7|pages=118–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar discriminatory presumptions are found in other Buddhist texts such as the ''[[Blood Bowl Sutra]]'' and the ''[[Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra]]''.&lt;ref name="Faure2009p54" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole1994p203"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Alan Cole |title=Mothers and Sons in Chinese Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PC1f-zw3zNQC |year=1994|publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-6510-7 |pages=203–204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Five Obstacles theory{{Refn|group=note|The Lotus Sutra, for example, asserts "A woman's body is filthy, it is not a Dharma-receptacle. How can you attain unexcelled bodhi?... Also a woman's body even then has five obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gene Reeves|title=A Buddhist kaleidoscope: essays on the Lotus Sutra|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7NcQAQAAIAAJ| year=2002|publisher=Kosei |isbn=978-4-333-01918-2| pages=363, 447–448, 475}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gwilym Beckerlegge| title=The World Religions Reader| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=52E9VaEATXcC |year=2001| publisher=Routledge| isbn=978-0-415-24749-8|pages=369–370}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} of Buddhism, a woman is required to attain rebirth as a man before she can adequately pursue the Eightfold Path and reach perfect Buddhahood. The ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' similarly presents the story of the [[Longnü|Dragon King's daughter]], who desires to achieve perfect enlightenment. The Sutra states that, "Her female organs vanished, the male organs became visible, then she appeared as a bodhisattva".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard Faure|title=The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HidpRwrmx4AC|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-09171-6|pages=99–100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender discrimination worsened during the medieval era in various sub-traditions of Buddhism that independently developed regionally, such as in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard Faure|title=The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HidpRwrmx4AC|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-09171-6|pages=112–116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars, such as Kenneth Doo Young Lee, interpret the ''Lotus Sutra'' to imply that "women were capable of gaining salvation", either after they first turned into a man, or being reborn in Pure Land realm after following the Path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Kenneth Doo Young Lee|title=Prince and the Monk, The: Shotoku Worship in Shinran's Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8Xnk04cEGIC |year=2012|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-8046-5 |pages=93–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Harvey lists many ''Sutras'' that suggest "having faded out the mind-set of a woman and developed the mind-set of a man, he was born in his present male form", and who then proceeds to follow the Path and became an Arahant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey |title=An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CTSz3EVRpoC |year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-55640-8 |pages=368–370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Mahayana texts, there is a sutra dedicated to the concept of how a person might be born as a woman. The traditional assertion is that women are more prone to harboring feelings of greed, hatred and delusion than a man. The Buddha responds to this assumption by teaching the method of moral development through which a woman can achieve rebirth as a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey |title=An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CTSz3EVRpoC|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-55640-8|pages=371–372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wei-Yi Cheng, the Pali Canon is silent about women's inferior karma, but have statements and stories that mention the Eightfold Path while advocating female subordination.&lt;ref name="Cheng2007p58"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wei-Yi Cheng |title=Buddhist Nuns in Taiwan and Sri Lanka: A Critique of the Feminist Perspective |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwXDitVJ9t0C&amp;pg=PA58|year=2007|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-16811-8|pages=58–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a goddess reborn in the [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|heavenly realm]] asserts:
{{Quote|
When I was born a human being among men I was a daughter-in-law in a wealthy family. I was without anger, obedient to my husband, diligent on the Observance (days). When I was born a human being, young and innocent, with a mind of faith, I delighted my lord. By day and by night I acted to please. Of old (...). On the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth (days) of the bright fortnight and on a special day of the fortnight well connected with the eightfold (precepts) I observed the Observance day with a mind of faith, was one who was faring according to Dhamma with zeal in my heart...
|''Vimanavatthu III.3.31''|Wei-Yi Cheng&lt;ref name="Cheng2007p58" /&gt;}}

Such examples, states Wei-Yi Cheng, include conflating statements about spiritual practice (Eightfold Path, Dhamma) and "obedience to my husband" and "by  day and by night I acted to please", thus implying unquestioned obedience of male authority and female subjugation.&lt;ref name="Cheng2007p58" /&gt; Such statements are not isolated, but common, such as in section II.13 of the ''Petavatthu'' which teaches that a woman had to "put away the thoughts of a woman" as she pursued the Path and this merit obtained her a better rebirth; the ''Jataka'' stories of the Pali Canon have numerous such stories, as do the Chinese Sutta that assert "undesirability of womanhood".&lt;ref name="Cheng2007p58" /&gt; Modern Buddhist nuns have applied Buddhist doctrines such as [[Pratītyasamutpāda]] to explain their disagreement with women's inferior karma in past lives as implied in ''Samyutta Nikaya 13'', states Wei-Yi Cheng, while asserting that the Path can be practiced by either gender and "both men and women can become arhant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wei-Yi Cheng |title=Buddhist Nuns in Taiwan and Sri Lanka: A Critique of the Feminist Perspective |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwXDitVJ9t0C&amp;pg=PA58|year=2007|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-16811-8|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cognitive psychology ==
The noble eightfold path has been compared to cognitive psychology, wherein states Gil Fronsdal, the right view factor can be interpreted to mean how one's mind views the world, and how that leads to patterns of thought, intention and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n19J-wDlJlQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=q9W5uGhg1R&amp;dq=%C2%BBThe%20Dhammapada%3A%20A%20New%20Translation%20of%20the%20Buddhist%20Classic%20with%20Annotations&amp;pg=PT33 |title=The Dhammapada: A New Translation of the Buddhist Classic with Annotations |accessdate=14 July 2009|publisher=Shambhala Publications, Inc. |last=Gil Fronsdal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Peter Randall states that it is the seventh factor or right mindfulness that may be thought in terms of cognitive psychology, wherein the change in thought and behavior are linked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Randall |title=The Psychology of Feeling Sorry: The Weight of the Soul |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3iw5b4bbQkQC |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-17026-3 |pages=206–208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait Gandhi.jpg|thumb|[[Mahatma Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]], often considered a founder of the nonviolence movement, spread the concept of [[ahimsa]] through his movements and writings, which then inspired other nonviolent activists.]]

'''Nonviolence'''&lt;!-- Don't put back the ridiculous claim back that the English word comes from Sanskrit; it's not even a calque or loan translation. The influence of Indian philosophy on the West is denigrated by such unencyclopedic nonsense.--&gt; is the personal practice of being harmless to self and others under every condition.  It comes from the belief that hurting people, animals or the environment is unnecessary to achieve an outcome and refers to a general philosophy of abstention from violence. This may be based on moral, religious or spiritual principles, or it may be for purely strategic or pragmatic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;A clarification of this and related terms appears in [[Gene Sharp]], ''Sharp's Dictionary of Power and Struggle: Language of Civil Resistance in Conflicts'', Oxford University Press, New York, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonviolence also has 'active' or 'activist' elements, in that believers generally accept the need for nonviolence as a means to achieve political and [[social change]]. Thus, for example, the Tolstoy and Gandhian non violence is a philosophy and strategy for social change that rejects the use of [[violence]], but at the same time sees [[nonviolent action]] (also called [[civil resistance]]) as an alternative to passive acceptance of oppression or armed struggle against it. In general, advocates of an activist philosophy of nonviolence use diverse methods in their campaigns for social change, including critical forms of education and persuasion, mass noncooperation, [[civil disobedience]], nonviolent [[direct action]], and social, political, cultural and economic forms of intervention.

The term "nonviolence" is often linked with or used as a synonym for peace, and despite being frequently equated with passivity and pacifism, this is rejected by nonviolent advocates and activists.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, Peter and Jack DuVall (2001) "A Force More Powerful: A Century of Non-Violent Conflict"(Palgrave Macmillan)&lt;/ref&gt; Nonviolence refers specifically to the absence of violence and is always the choice to do no harm or the least harm, and passivity is the choice to do nothing.  Sometimes nonviolence is passive, and other times it isn't. For example, if a house is burning down with mice or insects in it, the most harmless appropriate action is to put the fire out, not to sit by and passively let the fire burn. There is at times confusion and contradiction written about nonviolence, harmlessness and passivity. A confused person may advocate nonviolence in a specific context while advocating violence in other contexts. For example, someone who passionately opposes abortion or meat eating may concurrently advocate violence to kill an abortionist or attack a slaughterhouse, which makes that person a violent person.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Roberts, Introduction, in [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009 [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s pp. 3 and 13-20.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{Expand-section|date=October 2017}}
Nonviolence or ''Ahimsa'' is one of the cardinal virtues&lt;ref name=evpc/&gt; and an important tenet of [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]]. It is a multidimensional concept,&lt;ref name=arapura&gt;John Arapura in K. R. Sundararajan and Bithika Mukerji Ed. (1997), Hindu spirituality: Postclassical and modern, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1937-5}}; see Chapter 20, pages 392–417&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. It has also been related to the notion that any violence has [[Karma|karmic]] consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of ''Ahimsa'', the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism.&lt;ref name=evpc&gt;Stephen H. Phillips &amp; other authors (2008), in Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, &amp; Conflict (Second Edition), {{ISBN|978-0-12-373985-8}}, Elsevier Science, Pages 1347–1356, 701–849, 1867&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chapple1990&gt;Chapple, C. (1990). Nonviolence to animals, earth and self in Asian Traditions (see Chapter 1). State University of New York Press (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parsvanatha]], the twenty-third ''[[tirthankara]]'' of Jainism, revived,  advocated for and preached the concept of nonviolence in around eighth-century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Parshvanatha |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Parshvanatha |work=britannica.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahavira]], the twenty-fourth and the last ''tirthankara'' further strengthened the idea in sixth-century BC; which was believed to be founded by the first tirthankara [[Rishabhanatha|Rushabhdev]] over a million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Mahavira |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mahavira-Jaina-teacher |work=britannica.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=SXgEfiNY46sC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=Rushabhdev+million#v=onepage&amp;q=Rushabhdev%20million&amp;f=false | title=Thoughts from the Cosmic Field in the Life of a Thinking Insect &amp;#91;A Latter-Day Saint&amp;#93;| isbn=9781606938461| last1=Patel| first1=Haresh| date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms==
Advocates of nonviolent action believe cooperation and consent are the roots of civil or political power: all regimes, including bureaucratic institutions, financial institutions, and the armed segments of society (such as the military and police); depend on compliance from citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | title = The Politics of Nonviolent Action | publisher = Porter Sargent | year = 1973 | page = 12 | isbn = 978-0-87558-068-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a national level, the strategy of nonviolent action seeks to undermine the power of rulers by encouraging people to withdraw their consent and cooperation. The forms of nonviolence draw inspiration from both religious or ethical beliefs and political analysis. Religious or ethically based nonviolence is sometimes referred to as ''principled,'' ''philosophical,'' or ''ethical'' nonviolence, while nonviolence based on political analysis is often referred to as ''tactical,'' ''strategic,'' or ''pragmatic'' nonviolent action. Commonly, both of these dimensions may be present within the thinking of particular movements or individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/info/nv2.htm Two Kinds of Nonviolent Resistance] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--[[Gene Sharp]], in his book ''The Politics of Non-violent Action,'' suggests that the absence of nonviolent action from mainstream historical study is because elite interests are not served by the dissemination of techniques for social struggle that rely on the collective power of a mobilized citizenry rather than on access to wealth or weaponry. This does not seem to fit in any of the established sections, but it is a good point. --&gt;

===Pragmatic===
The fundamental concept of ''pragmatic'' (''tactical'' or ''strategic'') nonviolent action is to create a social dynamic or political movement that can create a national or international dialogue which effects social change without necessarily winning over those who wish to maintain the status quo.&lt;ref name="CRMV"&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/info/nvpower.htm Nonviolent Resistance &amp; Political Power] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans (U.S.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicolas Walter]] noted the idea that nonviolence might work "runs under the surface of Western political thought without ever quite disappearing".&lt;ref name="nw"&gt;Nicolas Walter, "Non-Violent Resistance:Men Against War". Reprinted
in Nicolas Walter, ''Damned Fools in Utopia'' edited by [[David Goodway]]. PM Press 2010.
{{ISBN|160486222X}} (pp. 37-78).&lt;/ref&gt; Walter noted [[Étienne de La Boétie]]'s ''[[Discourse on Voluntary Servitude]]'' (sixteenth century) and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|P.B. Shelley's]] ''[[The Masque of Anarchy]]'' (1819) contain arguments for resisting tyranny without using violence.&lt;ref name="nw" /&gt; In 1838, [[William Lloyd Garrison]] helped
found the [[Non-Resistance Society|New England Non-Resistance Society]], a society devoted to achieving racial and gender equality through the rejection of all violent actions.&lt;ref name="nw" /&gt;

In modern industrial democracies, nonviolent action has been used extensively by political sectors without mainstream political power such as labor, peace, environment and women's movements. Lesser known is the role that nonviolent action has played and continues to play in undermining the power of repressive political regimes in the developing world and the former eastern bloc. Susan Ives emphasizes this point by quoting [[Walter Wink]]: {{Quotation|"In 1989, thirteen nations comprising 1,695,000,000 people experienced nonviolent revolutions that succeeded beyond anyone's wildest expectations ... If we add all the countries touched by major nonviolent actions in our century (the Philippines, South Africa ... the independence movement in India ...), the figure reaches 3,337,400,000, a staggering 65% of humanity! All this in the teeth of the assertion, endlessly repeated, that nonviolence doesn't work in the 'real' world."|Walter Wink|Christian theologian&lt;ref name=Ives2001/&gt;}}

As a technique for social struggle, nonviolent action has been described as "the politics of ordinary people", reflecting its historically mass-based use by populations throughout the world and history.

Movements most often associated with nonviolence are the [[Non-cooperation movement|non-cooperation campaign]] for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] led by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the [[United States]], and the [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]].

Also of primary significance is the notion that just means are the most likely to lead to just ends. When Gandhi said that "the means may be likened to the seed, the end to a tree," he expressed the philosophical kernel of what some refer to as ''[[prefigurative politics]]''. Martin Luther King, a student of Gandhian nonviolent resistance, concurred with this tenet, concluding that "nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek." Proponents of nonviolence reason that the actions taken in the present inevitably re-shape the social order in like form. They would argue, for instance, that it is fundamentally irrational to use violence to achieve a peaceful society.

People have come to use nonviolent methods of struggle from a wide range of perspectives and traditions. A landless peasant in Brazil may nonviolently occupy a parcel of land for purely practical motivations. If they do not, the family will starve. A Buddhist monk in Thailand may "ordain" trees in a threatened forest, drawing on the teachings of Buddha to resist its destruction. A waterside worker in England may go on strike in socialist and union political traditions. All the above are using nonviolent methods but from different standpoints. Likewise, secular political movements have utilized nonviolent methods, either as a tactical tool or as a strategic program on purely pragmatic and strategic levels, relying on their political effectiveness rather than a claim to any religious, moral or ethical worthiness.
[[File:Salt March.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Gandhi used the weapon of nonviolence against [[British Raj]]]]

Respect or love for opponents also has a pragmatic justification, in that the technique of separating the deeds from the doers allows for the possibility of the doers changing their behaviour, and perhaps their beliefs. Martin Luther King wrote, "Nonviolent resistance... avoids not only external physical violence but also internal violence of spirit. The nonviolent resister not only refuses to shoot his opponent, but he also refuses to hate him."&lt;ref name="Jr.2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Luther King, Jr.|authorlink=Martin Luther King, Jr.|title=Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnJ1NY5mbXEC&amp;pg=PT114|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-0070-0|page=114|date=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the notion of ''[[Satya]]'', or Truth, is central to the Gandhian conception of nonviolence. Gandhi saw Truth as something that is multifaceted and unable to be grasped in its entirety by any one individual. All carry pieces of the Truth, he believed, but all need the pieces of others’ truths in order to pursue the greater Truth. This led him to believe in the inherent worth of dialogue with opponents, in order to understand motivations. On a practical level, the willingness to listen to another's point of view is largely dependent on reciprocity. In order to be heard by one's opponents, one must also be prepared to listen.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Nonviolence has obtained a level of institutional recognition and endorsement at the global level. On November 10, 1998, the [[United Nations]] General Assembly proclaimed the first decade of the 21st century and the third millennium, the years 2001 to 2010, as the International [[Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World]].

===Ethical===
For many, practicing nonviolence goes deeper than abstaining from violent behavior or words. It means overriding the impulse to be hateful and holding love for everyone, even those with whom one strongly disagrees. In this view, because violence is learned, it is necessary to unlearn violence by practicing love and compassion at every possible opportunity.  For some, the commitment to non-violence entails a belief in restorative or [[transformative justice]], an abolition of the death penalty and other harsh punishments.  This may involve the necessity of caring for those who are violent.

Nonviolence, for many, involves a respect and reverence for all [[Sentience#Animal rights and sentience|sentient]], and perhaps even [[Biocentrism (ethics)|non-sentient, beings]]. This might include [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionism]] against animals as property, the practice of not eating animal products or by-products ([[vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]]), spiritual practices of [[Ahimsa|non-harm]] to all beings, and caring for the rights of all beings. [[Mohandas Gandhi]], [[James Bevel]], and other nonviolent proponents advocated vegetarianism as part of their nonviolent philosophy. [[Ahimsa#Buddhism|Buddhists extend this respect for life]] to [[animals]], [[plants]], and even [[minerals]], while [[Ahimsa#Jainism|Jainism]] extend this respect for [[life]] to [[animals]], [[plants]] and even small organisms such as [[insects]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/animal-vegetable-mineral-the-making-of-buddhist-texts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://people.uwec.edu/ivogeler/w111/articles/jainism.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical Indian text of [[Tirukkuṛaḷ]] deals with the ethics of non-violence or non-harming through verses 311-320 in Chapter 32 of [[Aram (Kural book)|Book 1]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm Tirukkuṛaḷ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216064046/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm |date=2014-12-16 }} verses 311-320&lt;/ref&gt; further discussing [[compassion]] in Chapter 25 (verses 241-250), [[vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]] in Chapter 26 (verses 251-260), and [[non-killing]] in Chapter 33 (verses 321-330).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf | title=Thirukkural English Translation and Commentary | publisher=W.H.

===Religious===
====Hinduism====

=====Ancient Vedic texts=====
Ahimsa as an ethical concept evolved in Vedic texts.&lt;ref name=chapple1990/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walli, Koshelya: ''The Conception of Ahimsa in Indian Thought'', Varanasi 1974, p. 113–145.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest scripts, along with discussing ritual animal sacrifices, indirectly mention Ahimsa, but do not emphasise it. Over time, the Hindu scripts revise ritual practices and the concept of Ahimsa is increasingly refined and emphasised, ultimately Ahimsa becomes the highest virtue by the late Vedic era (about 500 BC). For example, hymn 10.22.25 in the Rig Veda uses the words [[Satya]] (truthfulness) and Ahimsa in a prayer to deity Indra;&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit: अस्मे ता त इन्द्र सन्तु '''सत्याहिंस'''न्तीरुपस्पृशः । विद्याम यासां भुजो धेनूनां न वज्रिवः ॥१३॥ [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.२२ Rigveda 10.22] Wikisource;&lt;br&gt;English: Unto Tähtinen (1964), Non-violence as an Ethical Principle, Turun Yliopisto, Finland, PhD Thesis, pages 23–25; {{oclc|4288274}};&lt;br&gt;For other occurrence of Ahimsa in Rigveda, see [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_५.६४ Rigveda 5.64.3], [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१.१४१ Rigveda 1.141.5];&lt;/ref&gt; later, the [[Yajurveda|Yajur Veda]] dated to be between 1000 BC and 600 BC, states, "may all beings look at me with a friendly eye, may I do likewise, and may we look at each other with the eyes of a friend".&lt;ref name=chapple1990/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/himalayanacademy/sacredhinduliterature/lws/lws_ch-39.html To do no harm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017133837/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/himalayanacademy/sacredhinduliterature/lws/lws_ch-39.html |date=2013-10-17 }} Project Gutenberg, see translation for Yajurveda 36.18 VE;&lt;br&gt;For other occurrences of Ahimsa in Vedic literature, see [https://archive.org/stream/vedicconcordance00bloouoft#page/150/mode/2up A Vedic Concordance] [[Maurice Bloomfield]], Harvard University Press, page 151&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Ahimsa'' appears in the text [[Taittiriya Shakha]] of the [[Yajurveda]] (TS 5.2.8.7), where it refers to non-injury to the sacrificer himself.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs several times in the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'' in the sense of "non-injury".&lt;ref&gt;Shatapatha Brahmana 2.3.4.30; 2.5.1.14; 6.3.1.26; 6.3.1.39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ahimsa doctrine is a late Vedic era development in Brahmanical culture.&lt;ref name="houben 1999"&gt;Henk M. Bodewitz in Jan E. M. Houben, K. R. van Kooij, ed., ''Violence denied: violence, non-violence and the rationalisation of violence in "South Asian" cultural history.'' BRILL, 1999 page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to the idea of non-violence to animals ("pashu-Ahimsa"), apparently in a moral sense, is in the Kapisthala Katha Samhita of the Yajurveda (KapS 31.11), which may have been written in about the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowker states the word appears but is uncommon in the principal Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker, ''Problems of suffering in religions of the world.'' Cambridge University Press, 1975, page 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaneda gives examples of the word ''Ahimsa'' in these Upanishads.&lt;ref name=kaneda2008&gt;Kaneda, T. (2008). Shanti, peacefulness of mind. C.

Empathy for Pain in Vedic Ritual. Journal of the International College for Advanced Buddhist Studies, 12, 78&lt;/ref&gt; suggest ''Ahimsa'' as an ethical concept that started evolving in the Vedas, becoming an increasingly central concept in Upanishads.

The [[Chāndogya Upaniṣad]], dated to the 8th or 7th century BCE, one of the oldest [[Upanishads]], has the earliest evidence for the [[Vedas|Vedic era]] use of the word ''Ahimsa'' in the sense familiar in Hinduism (a code of conduct). It bars violence against "all creatures" (''sarvabhuta'') and the practitioner of Ahimsa is said to escape from the cycle of [[Reincarnation|rebirths]] (CU 8.15.1).&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 2–5; English translation: Schmidt p. 631.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars state that this 8th or 7th-century BCE mention may have been an influence of Jainism on Vedic Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;M.K Sridhar and Puruṣottama Bilimoria (2007), ''Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges,'' Editors: Puruṣottama Bilimoria, Joseph Prabhu, Renuka M. Sharma, Ashgate Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-3301-3}}, page 315&lt;/ref&gt; Others scholar state that this relationship is speculative, and though Jainism is an ancient tradition the oldest traceable texts of Jainism tradition are from many centuries after the Vedic era ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D.

Chāndogya Upaniṣad also names Ahimsa, along with Satyavacanam (truthfulness), Arjavam (sincerity), [[Dāna|Danam]] (charity), [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapo]] (penance/meditation), as one of five essential virtues (CU 3.17.4).&lt;ref name=arapura/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravindra Kumar (2008), Non-violence and Its Philosophy, {{ISBN|978-81-7933-159-0}}, see page 11–14&lt;/ref&gt;

A Lecture on the Vedánta: Embracing the Text of the Vedánta-sára. Presbyterian mission press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kaneda,&lt;ref name=kaneda2008/&gt; the term Ahimsa is an important spiritual doctrine shared by Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It literally means 'non-injury' and 'non-killing'. It implies the total avoidance of harming of any kind of living creatures not only by deeds, but also by words and in thoughts.

=====The Epics=====
The [[Mahabharata]], one of the epics of Hinduism, has multiple mentions of the phrase ''Ahimsa Paramo Dharma'' (अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मः), which literally means: non-violence is the highest moral virtue. For example, [[Mahaprasthanika Parva]] has the verse:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/mbs/mbs13117.htm Mahabharata 13.117.37–38]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मस तथाहिंसा परॊ दमः।
अहिंसा परमं दानम अहिंसा परमस तपः।
अहिंसा परमॊ यज्ञस तथाहिस्मा परं बलम।
अहिंसा परमं मित्रम अहिंसा परमं सुखम।
अहिंसा परमं सत्यम अहिंसा परमं शरुतम॥
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The above passage from Mahabharata emphasises the cardinal importance of Ahimsa in Hinduism, and literally means: Ahimsa is the highest [[virtue]], Ahimsa is the highest self-control, Ahimsa is the greatest gift, Ahimsa is the best suffering, Ahimsa is the highest sacrifice, Ahimsa is the finest strength, Ahimsa is the greatest friend, Ahimsa is the greatest happiness, Ahimsa is the highest truth, and Ahimsa is the greatest teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Chapple, C. (1990). Ecological Nonviolence and the Hindu Tradition. In Perspectives on Nonviolence (pp. 168–177). Springer New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/pdf_downloads/what_is_hinduism/Sec6/WIH_Sec6_Chapter45.pdf Ahimsa: To do no harm] Subramuniyaswami, What is Hinduism?, Chapter 45, Pages 359–361&lt;/ref&gt; Some other examples where the phrase ''Ahimsa Paramo Dharma'' are discussed include [[Adi Parva]], [[Vana Parva]] and [[Anushasana Parva]]. The [[Bhagavad Gita]], among other things, discusses the doubts and questions about appropriate response when one faces systematic violence or war. These verses develop the concepts of lawful violence in self-defence and the [[Just war theory|theories of just war]]. However, there is no consensus on this interpretation. Gandhi, for example, considers this debate about non-violence and lawful violence as a mere metaphor for the internal war within each human being, when he or she faces moral questions.&lt;ref name=fischer1954/&gt;

=====Self-defence, criminal law, and war=====
The classical texts of Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice the virtue of Ahimsa, can and must do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone convicted of a crime. These discussions have led to theories of just war, theories of reasonable self-defence and theories of proportionate punishment.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012&gt;Balkaran, R., &amp; Dorn, A. W. (2012). [http://www.sareligionuoft.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/JAAR-Article-Violence-in-the-Valmiki-Ramayana-Just-War-Criteria-in-an-Ancient-Indian-Epic-.pdf Violence in the Vālmı̄ki Rāmāyaṇa: Just War Criteria in an Ancient Indian Epic], Journal of the American Academy of Religion, 80(3), 659–690.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=klos1996&gt;[[Klaus K.

Robinson (2003), Just War in Comparative Perspective, {{ISBN|0-7546-3587-2}}, Ashgate Publishing, see pages 114–125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coates, B. E. (2008). Modern India's Strategic Advantage to the United States: Her Twin Strengths in Himsa and Ahimsa. Comparative Strategy, 27(2), pages 133–147&lt;/ref&gt;

;War
The precepts of Ahimsa under Hinduism require that war must be avoided, with sincere and truthful dialogue. Force must be the last resort. If war becomes necessary, its cause must be just, its purpose virtuous, its objective to restrain the wicked, its aim peace, its method lawful.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; War can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority. Weapons used must be proportionate to the opponent and the aim of war, not indiscriminate tools of destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, S. P. (2003). The Concept in Hinduism of 'Just War'. Journal of Conflict and Security Law, 8(2), pages 339–361&lt;/ref&gt; All strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat the opponent, not designed to cause misery to the opponent; for example, use of arrows is allowed, but use of arrows smeared with painful poison is not allowed. Warriors must use judgment in the battlefield. Cruelty to the opponent during war is forbidden. Wounded, unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed, they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment.&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; Children, women and civilians must not be injured. While the war is in progress, sincere dialogue for peace must continue.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=klos1996/&gt;

;Self-defence
In matters of self-defence, different interpretations of ancient Hindu texts have been offered. For example, Tähtinen suggests self-defence is appropriate, criminals are not protected by the rule of Ahimsa, and Hindu scriptures support the use of violence against an armed attacker.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 96, 98–101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 12.15.55; Manu Smriti 8.349–350; Matsya Purana 226.116.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa is not meant to imply pacifism.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 91–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternate theories of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to theories of just war. [[Aikido]], pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. [[Morihei Ueshiba]], the founder of Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportspa.com.ba/images/dec2011/full/rad8.pdf The Role of Teachers in Martial Arts] Nebojša Vasic, University of Zenica (2011); Sport SPA Vol. 8, Issue 2: 47–51; see page 46, 2nd column&lt;/ref&gt; According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume that the world is free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060116174614/http://www.aiki-extensions.org/pubs/conflict-body_text.pdf SOCIAL CONFLICT, AGGRESSION, AND THE BODY IN EURO-AMERICAN AND ASIAN SOCIAL THOUGHT] Donald Levine, University of Chicago (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ueshiba, Kisshōmaru (2004), ''The Art of Aikido: Principles and Essential Techniques'', Kodansha International, {{ISBN|4-7700-2945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Criminal law
Tähtinen concludes that Hindus have no misgivings about death penalty; their position is that evil-doers who deserve death should be killed, and that a king in particular is obliged to punish criminals and should not hesitate to kill them, even if they happen to be his own brothers and sons.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 96, 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars&lt;ref name=klos1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; conclude that the scriptures of Hinduism suggest sentences for any crime must be fair, proportional and not cruel.

; Pacifism
There is no consensus on [[pacifism]] among modern Hindu scholars. The conflict between pacifistic interpretations of Ahimsa and the theories of [[just war]] prescribed by the Gita has been resolved by some scholars such as [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], as being an allegory,&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, Mohandas K., ''The Bhagavad Gita According to Gandhi'' Berkeley Hills Books, Berkeley 2000&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the battlefield is the soul and Arjuna, the war is within each human being, where man's higher impulses struggle against his own evil impulses.&lt;ref name=fischer1954&gt;Fischer, Louis: ''Gandhi: His Life and Message to the World'' Mentor, New York 1954, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Non-human life=====
The Hindu precept of 'cause no injury' applies to animals and all life forms. This precept isn't found in the oldest verses of Vedas, but increasingly becomes one of the central ideas between 500 BC and 400 AD.&lt;ref name=chapple16&gt;Christopher Chapple (1993), Nonviolence to Animals, Earth, and Self in Asian Traditions, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-1498-1}}, pages 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W Norman Brown (February 1964), [http://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1964_16/5-6-7/the_sanctity_of_the_cow_in_hinduism.pdf ''The sanctity of the cow in Hinduism''], The Economic Weekly, pages 245–255&lt;/ref&gt; In the oldest texts, numerous ritual sacrifices of animals, including cows and horses, are highlighted and hardly any mention is made of Ahimsa to non-human life.&lt;ref&gt;D.N. Jha (2002), ''The Myth of the Holy Cow'', {{ISBN|1-85984-676-9}}, Verso&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Rosen (2004), Holy Cow: The Hare Krishna Contribution to Vegetarianism and Animal Rights, {{ISBN|1-59056-066-3}}, pages 19–39&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu scriptures, dated to between 5th century and 1st century BC, while discussing human diet, initially suggest ''kosher'' meat may be eaten, evolving it with the suggestion that only meat obtained through ritual sacrifice can be eaten, then that one should eat no meat because it hurts animals, with verses describing the noble life as one that lives on flowers, roots and fruits alone.&lt;ref name=chapple16/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Baudhayana]] Dharmasutra 2.4.7; 2.6.2; 2.11.15; 2.12.8; 3.1.13; 3.3.6; [[Apastamba]] Dharmasutra 1.17.15; 1.17.19; 2.17.26–2.18.3; Vasistha Dharmasutra 14.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later texts of Hinduism declare Ahimsa one of the primary virtues, declare any killing or harming any life as against ''dharma'' (moral life). Finally, the discussion in Upanishads and Hindu Epics&lt;ref&gt;Manu Smriti 5.30, 5.32, 5.39 and 5.44; Mahabharata 3.199 (3.207), 3.199.5 (3.207.5), 3.199.19–29 (3.207.19), 3.199.23–24 (3.207.23–24), 13.116.15–18, 14.28; Ramayana 1-2-8:19&lt;/ref&gt; shifts to whether a human being can ever live his or her life without harming animal and plant life in some way; which and when plants or animal meat may be eaten, whether violence against animals causes human beings to become less compassionate, and if and how one may exert least harm to non-human life consistent with ahimsa precept, given the constraints of life and human needs.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf pp. 592–593.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 13.115.59–60; 13.116.15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahabharata permits hunting by warriors, but opposes it in the case of hermits who must be strictly non-violent. [[Sushruta Samhita]], a Hindu text written in the 3rd or 4th century, in Chapter XLVI suggests proper diet as a means of treating certain illnesses, and recommends various fishes and meats for different ailments and for pregnant women,&lt;ref&gt;Kaviraj Kunja Lal Bhishagratna (1907), An English Translation of the Sushruta Samhita, Volume I, Part 2; see Chapter starting on page 469; for discussion on meats and fishes, see page 480 and onwards&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutrasthana 46.89; Sharirasthana 3.25.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Charaka Samhita]] describes meat as superior to all other kinds of food for convalescents.&lt;ref&gt;Sutrasthana 27.87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Across the texts of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to non-human life, but without a universal consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 3.199.11–12 (3.199 is 3.207 elsewhere); 13.115; 13.116.26; 13.148.17; Bhagavata Purana (11.5.13–14), and the Chandogya Upanishad (8.15.1).&lt;/ref&gt; Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf pp. 572–577 (for the Manusmṛti) and pp. 585–597 (for the Mahabharata); Tähtinen pp. 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mahabharata and the Manusmṛti (5.27–55) contain lengthy discussions about the legitimacy of ritual slaughter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12b095.htm Mahabharata 12.260] (12.260 is 12.268 according to another count); 13.115–116; 14.28.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03207.htm Mahabharata 3.199] (3.199 is 3.207 according to another count).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the arguments proposed in favor of non-violence to animals refer to the bliss one feels, the rewards it entails before or after death, the danger and harm it prevents, as well as to the karmic consequences of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 39–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf p. 589–590; Schmidt pp. 634–635, 640–643; Tähtinen pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Hindu texts discuss Ahimsa and non-animal life. They discourage wanton destruction of nature including of wild and cultivated plants. Hermits ([[sannyasa|sannyasin]]s) were urged to live on a [[fruitarian]] diet so as to avoid the destruction of plants.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt pp. 637–639; Manusmriti 10.63, 11.145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rod Preece, Animals and Nature: Cultural Myths, Cultural Realities, {{ISBN|978-0-7748-0725-8}}, University of British Columbia Press, pages 212–217&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars&lt;ref&gt;Chapple, C. (1990). Ecological Nonviolence and the Hindu Tradition. In ''Perspectives on Nonviolence'' (pages 168–177). Springer New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Horn, G. (2006). Hindu Traditions and Nature: Survey Article. Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology, 10(1), 5–39&lt;/ref&gt; claim the principles of ecological non-violence is innate in the Hindu tradition, and its conceptual fountain has been Ahimsa as their cardinal virtue.

The classical literature of Hinduism exists in many Indian languages. For example, ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]],'' written between 200 BC and 400 AD, and sometimes called the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Veda]], is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. Tirukkuṛaḷ dedicates Chapters 26, 32 and 33 of Book 1 to the virtue of Ahimsa, namely, [[vegetarianism]], [[non-violence|non-harming]], and [[non-killing]], respectively. ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' says that Ahimsa applies to all life forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf Tirukkuṛaḷ] Translated by Rev G.U. Pope, Rev W.H.

[[File:Ahimsa.svg|thumb|The hand with a wheel on the palm symbolizes the Jain Vow of Ahimsa. The word in the middle is "Ahimsa". The wheel represents the [[dharmacakra]] which stands for the resolve to halt the cycle of reincarnation through relentless pursuit of truth and non-violence.]]
In Jainism, the understanding and implementation of ''Ahimsā'' is more radical, scrupulous, and comprehensive than in any other religion.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw, pp. 154–160; Jindal, pp. 74–90; Tähtinen p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Killing any living being out of passions is considered ''hiṃsā'' (to injure) and abstaining from such an act is ''ahimsā'' (noninjury).{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=34}} The vow of ahimsā is considered the foremost among the 'five vows of Jainism'. Other vows like truth (Satya) are meant for safeguarding the vow of ahimsā.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=33}} In the practice of Ahimsa, the requirements are less strict for the lay persons ([[sravakas]]) who have undertaken ''anuvrata'' (Smaller Vows) than for the [[Jain monasticism|Jain monastics]] who are bound by the [[Mahavrata]] "Great Vows".&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 158–159, 189–192; Laidlaw pp. 173–175, 179; ''Religious Vegetarianism'', ed. [[Kerry S. Walters]] and Lisa Portmess, Albany 2001, p. 43–46 (translation of the First Great Vow).&lt;/ref&gt; The statement ''{{IAST|ahimsā paramo dharmaḥ}}'' is often found inscribed on the walls of the [[Jain temple]]s.&lt;ref name=pauldundas160&gt;Dundas, Paul: ''The Jains'', second edition, London 2002, p. 160; Wiley, Kristi L.: ''Ahimsa and Compassion in Jainism'', in: ''Studies in Jaina History and Culture'', ed. Peter Flügel, London 2006, p. 438; Laidlaw pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt; Like in Hinduism, the aim is to prevent the accumulation of harmful karma.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw pp. 26–30, 191–195.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Mahavira]] revived and reorganized the Jain faith in the 6th or 5th century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Dundas p. 24 suggests the 5th century; the traditional dating of Mahavira's death is 527 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa was already an established, strictly observed rule.&lt;ref&gt;Goyal, S.R.: ''A History of Indian Buddhism'', Meerut 1987, p. 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rishabhanatha]] (Ādinātha), the first Jain [[Tirthankara]], whom modern Western historians consider to be a historical figure, followed by [[Parshvanatha]] (Pārśvanātha)&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 19, 30; Tähtinen p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; the twenty-third [[Tirthankara]] lived in about the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas p. 30 suggests the 8th or 7th century; the traditional chronology places him in the late 9th or early 8th century.&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the community to which Mahavira's parents belonged.&lt;ref&gt;[[Acaranga Sutra]] 2.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa was already part of the "Fourfold Restraint" (''Caujjama''), the vows taken by Parshva's followers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sthananga Sutra]] 266; Tähtinen p. 132; Goyal p. 83–84, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; In the times of Mahavira and in the following centuries, Jains were at odds with both Buddhists and followers of the Vedic religion or Hindus, whom they accused of negligence and inconsistency in the implementation of Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 160, 234, 241; Wiley p. 448; Granoff, Phyllis: ''The Violence of Non-Violence: A Study of Some Jain Responses to Non-Jain Religious Practices'', in: ''Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies'' 15 (1992) pp. 1–43; Tähtinen pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Jain tradition either [[lacto vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]] is mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain concept of Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. It does not make any exception for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw pp. 166–167; Tähtinen p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed for the sake of food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants.&lt;ref&gt;Lodha, R.M.: ''Conservation of Vegetation and Jain Philosophy'', in: ''Medieval Jainism: Culture and Environment'', New Delhi 1990, p. 137–141; Tähtinen p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Jains go out of their way so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals.&lt;ref&gt;Jindal p. 89; Laidlaw pp. 54, 154–155, 180.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jains often do not go out at night, when they are more likely to step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action.&lt;ref&gt;Sutrakrtangasutram 1.8.3; Uttaradhyayanasutra 10; Tattvarthasutra 7.8; Dundas pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt; Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to violence against the bees.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hemacandra]]: ''Yogashastra'' 3.37; Laidlaw pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects,&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Sangave, Vilas Adinath: ''Jaina Community. A Social Survey'', second edition, Bombay 1980, p. 259; Dundas p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, all life forms are said to deserve full protection from all kinds of injury, but Jains recognise a hierarchy of life. Mobile beings are given higher protection than immobile ones. For the mobile beings, they distinguish between one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed and five-sensed ones; a one-sensed animal has touch as its only sensory modality. The more senses a being has, the more they care about non-injuring it. Among the five-sensed beings, the precept of non-injury and non-violence to the rational ones (humans) is strongest in Jain Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Jindal pp. 89, 125–133 (detailed exposition of the classification system); Tähtinen pp. 17, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jains agree with Hindus that violence in self-defence can be justified,&lt;ref&gt;''Nisithabhasya'' (in ''Nisithasutra'') 289; Jinadatta Suri: ''Upadesharasayana'' 26; Dundas pp. 162–163; Tähtinen p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and they agree that a soldier who kills enemies in combat is performing a legitimate duty.&lt;ref&gt;Jindal pp. 89–90; Laidlaw pp. 154–155; Jaini, Padmanabh S.: ''Ahimsa and "Just War" in Jainism'', in: ''Ahimsa, Anekanta and Jainism'', ed. Tara Sethia, New Delhi 2004, p. 52–60; Tähtinen p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Jain communities accepted the use of military power for their defence, there were Jain monarchs, military commanders, and soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Harisena, ''Brhatkathakosa'' 124 (10th century); Jindal pp. 90–91; Sangave p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhism====
{{further information|Noble Eightfold Path|Buddhist ethics#Killing, causing others to kill|Buddhism and violence|Engaged Buddhism}}
In Buddhist texts ''Ahimsa'' (or its [[Pāli]] cognate {{IAST|avihiṃsā}}) is part of the [[Five Precepts]] ({{IAST|Pañcasīla}}), the first of which has been to abstain from killing. This precept of Ahimsa is applicable to both the Buddhist layperson and the monk community.&lt;ref name="Williams2005p398"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams |title=Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgrZnmKUKtgC |year=2005|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-33226-2 |page=398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bodhi Bhikkhu|title=Great Disciples of the Buddha: Their Lives, Their Works, Their Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teUGAAAAYAAJ |year=1997|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-128-4 |pages=387 with footnote 12}};&lt;br&gt;Sarao, p. 49; Goyal p. 143; Tähtinen p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamotte, Etienne 1988, p. 54-55"&gt;Lamotte, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ahimsa precept is not a commandment and transgressions did not invite religious sanctions for layperson, but their power has been in the Buddhist belief in karmic consequences and their impact in afterlife during rebirth.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=187}} Killing, in Buddhist belief, could lead to rebirth in the hellish realm, and for a longer time in more severe conditions if the murder victim was a monk.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=187}} Saving animals from slaughter for meat, is believed to be a way to acquire merit for better rebirth. These moral precepts have been voluntarily self-enforced in lay Buddhist culture through the associated belief in karma and rebirth.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|pp=187–191}} The Buddhist texts not only recommended Ahimsa, but suggest avoiding trading goods that contribute to or are a result of violence:

|Anguttara Nikaya V.177|Translated by Martine Batchelor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martine Batchelor|title=The Spirit of the Buddha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fL3mykqlOJcC&amp;pg=PT59 |year=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-17500-4 |page=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Unlike lay Buddhists, transgressions by monks do invite sanctions.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=192}} Full expulsion of a monk from ''sangha'' follows instances of killing, just like any other serious offense against the monastic ''nikaya'' code of conduct.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=192}}

=====War=====
Violent ways of punishing criminals and prisoners of war was not explicitly condemned in Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;Sarao p. 53; Tähtinen pp. 95, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; but peaceful ways of conflict resolution and punishment with the least amount of injury were encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 95, 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt A. Raaflaub, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FMxgef2VJEwC&amp;pg=PA61 ''War and Peace in the Ancient World.''] Blackwell Publishing, 2007, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The early texts condemn the mental states that lead to violent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonviolence is an overriding theme within the [[Pali Canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; While the early texts condemn killing in the strongest terms, and portray the ideal king as a pacifist, such a king is nonetheless flanked by an army.&lt;ref name="Tessa Bartholomeusz 2002, page 41"&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that the Buddha's teaching on nonviolence was not interpreted or put into practice in an uncompromisingly pacifist or anti-military-service way by early Buddhists.&lt;ref name="Tessa Bartholomeusz 2002, page 41"/&gt; The early texts assume war to be a fact of life, and well-skilled warriors are viewed as necessary for defensive warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In Pali texts, injunctions to abstain from violence and involvement with military affairs are directed at members of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]; later Mahayana texts, which often generalise monastic norms to laity, require this of lay people as well.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., ''Buddhism.'' Continuum, 2001, pages 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early texts do not contain just-war ideology as such.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that a [[suttas|sutta]] in the ''Gamani Samyuttam'' rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha if it is true that, as he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with the intention to kill, he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 125–126. Full texts of the sutta:[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn42/sn42.003.than.html].&lt;/ref&gt; In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.&lt;ref&gt;Rune E.A. Johansson, ''The Dynamic Psychology of Early Buddhism.'' Curzon Press 1979, page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Buddhists point to other early texts as justifying defensive war.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 40–53. Some examples are the ''Cakkavati Sihanada Sutta'', the ''Kosala Samyutta'', the ''Ratthapala Sutta'', and the ''Sinha Sutta''. See also page 125. See also Trevor Ling, ''Buddhism, Imperialism, and War.'' George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, 1979, pages 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the ''Kosala Samyutta'', in which King [[Pasenadi]], a righteous king favored by the Buddha, learns of an impending attack on his kingdom. He arms himself in defence, and leads his army into battle to protect his kingdom from attack. He lost this battle but won the war. King Pasenadi eventually defeated King [[Ajatasattu]] and captured him alive. He thought that, although this King of [[Magadha]] has transgressed against his kingdom, he had not transgressed against him personally, and Ajatasattu was still his nephew. He released Ajatasattu and did not harm him.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2000). ''The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya''. Boston: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-331-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, the Buddha said (among other things) that Pasenadi "is a friend of virtue, acquainted with virtue, intimate with virtue", while the opposite is said of the aggressor, King Ajatasattu.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 49, 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Theravada commentaries, there are five requisite factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) the presence of a living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death.&lt;ref&gt;Hammalawa Saddhatissa, ''Buddhist Ethics.'' Wisdom Publications, 1997, pages 60, 159, see also Bartholomeusz page 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 44, 121–122, 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar]], there is circumstantial evidence encouraging Ahimsa, from the Buddha's doctrine, ''"Love all, so that you may not wish to kill any."'' Gautama Buddha distinguished between a principle and a rule. He did not make Ahimsa a matter of rule, but suggested it as a matter of principle. This gives Buddhists freedom to act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_buddha/04_02.html#03_02 The Buddha and His Dhamma]. Columbia.edu.

==Methods==
[[File:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther King]] speaking at the 1963 "[[March on Washington]]".]]
Nonviolent action generally comprises three categories: ''Acts of Protest and Persuasion'', ''Noncooperation'', and ''Nonviolent Intervention''.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;[https://www.un.org/events/nonviolence/2008/background.shtml United Nations International Day of Non-Violence], United Nations, 2008. see [[International Day of Non-Violence]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acts of protest===

Nonviolent acts of protest and persuasion are symbolic actions performed by a group of people to show their support or disapproval of something. The goal of this kind of action is to bring public awareness to an issue, persuade or influence a particular group of people, or to facilitate future nonviolent action. The message can be directed toward the public, opponents, or people affected by the issue.  Methods of protest and persuasion include speeches, public communications, [[petition]]s, symbolic acts, art, [[Demonstration (people)|processions (marches), and other public assemblies]].&lt;ref name="sharp2005" &gt;{{cite book | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | title = Waging Nonviolent Struggle | publisher = Extending Horizon Books | year = 2005 | pages = 50–65 | isbn = 978-0-87558-162-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noncooperation===

Noncooperation involves the purposeful withholding of cooperation or the unwillingness to initiate in cooperation with an opponent. The goal of noncooperation is to halt or hinder an industry, political system, or economic process. Methods of noncooperation include [[labour strike]]s, [[boycotts|economic boycotts]], [[civil disobedience]], [[sex strike]], [[Tax resistance|tax refusal]], and general disobedience.&lt;ref name="sharp2005" /&gt;

===Nonviolent intervention===

Compared with protest and noncooperation, nonviolent intervention is a more direct method of nonviolent action. Nonviolent intervention can be used defensively—for example to maintain an institution or independent initiative—or offensively- for example, to drastically forward a nonviolent struggle into the opponent's territory. Intervention is often more immediate and effective than the other two methods, but is also harder to maintain and more taxing to the participants involved.

[[Gene Sharp]], a political scientist who seeks to advance the worldwide study and use of strategic nonviolent action in conflict, has written extensively about the methods of nonviolent action.  In his book ''Waging Nonviolent Struggle'' he describes 198 methods of nonviolent action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://peacemagazine.org/198.htm  | title = The Methods of Nonviolent Action | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | year = 1973 | publisher = Peace magazine | accessdate = 2008-11-07 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early Greece, [[Aristophanes]]' [[Lysistrata]] gives the fictional example of women withholding sexual favors from their husbands until war was abandoned. A modern work of fiction inspired by Gene Sharp and by Aristophanes is ''[[A Door into Ocean]]'' by [[Joan Slonczewski]], depicting an ocean world inhabited by women who use nonviolent means to repel armed space invaders. Other methods of nonviolent intervention include occupations ([[sit-in]]s), [[blockade]]s, fasting ([[hunger strikes]]), truck cavalcades, and dual sovereignty/parallel government.&lt;ref name="sharp2005" /&gt;

Tactics must be carefully chosen, taking into account political and cultural circumstances, and form part of a larger plan or strategy.

Successful [[Third Party Nonviolent Intervention|nonviolent cross-border intervention]] projects include the Guatemala Accompaniment Project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nisgua.org/ Network in Solidarity with the People of Guatemala]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peace Brigades International]] and [[Christian Peacemaker Teams]]. Developed in the early 1980s, and originally inspired by the Gandhian [[Shanti Sena]], the primary tools of these organisations have been nonviolent protective accompaniment, backed up by a global support network which can respond to threats, local and regional grassroots diplomatic and [[peacebuilding]] efforts, human rights observation and witnessing, and reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=PBI's principles | url=http://www.peacebrigades.org/about-pbi/how-we-work/ | website=Peace Brigades International | publisher=PBI General Assembly | origyear=1992 | year=2001 | accessdate=2009-05-17 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602190353/http://www.peacebrigades.org/about-pbi/how-we-work/ | archivedate=2010-06-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Christian Peace Maker Teams Mission Statement | url=http://www.cpt.org/about/mission | website=Christian Peacemaker Team | publisher=CPT founding conference | year=1986 | accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In extreme cases, most of these groups are also prepared to do interpositioning: placing themselves between parties who are engaged or threatening to engage in outright attacks in one or both directions.  Individual and large group cases of interpositioning, when called for, have been remarkably effective in dampening conflict and saving lives.

Another powerful tactic of nonviolent intervention invokes public scrutiny of the oppressors as a result of the resisters remaining nonviolent in the face of violent repression. If the military or police attempt to repress nonviolent resisters violently, the power to act shifts from the hands of the oppressors to those of the resisters. If the resisters are persistent, the military or police will be forced to accept the fact that they no longer have any power over the resisters. Often, the willingness of the resisters to suffer has a profound effect on the mind and emotions of the oppressor, leaving them unable to commit such a violent act again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | title = The Politics of Nonviolent Action | publisher = P. Sargent Publisher | year = 1973 | page =  657 | isbn = 978-0-87558-068-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | title = Waging Nonviolent Struggle | publisher = Extending Horizon Books | year = 2005 | page = 381 | isbn = 978-0-87558-162-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolution==
Certain individuals ([[Barbara Deming]], [[Danilo Dolci]], [[Devere Allen]] etc.) and party groups (e.g. [[Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism]], [[Pacifist Socialist Party]] or [[War Resisters League]]) have advocated [[nonviolent revolution]] as an alternative to violence as well as elitist reformism. This perspective is usually connected to militant [[anti-capitalism]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Many leftist and socialist movements &lt;!-- which movements? --&gt; have hoped to mount a "peaceful revolution" by organising enough strikers to completely paralyse the state and corporate apparatus, allowing workers to re-organise society along radically different lines. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Some have argued that a relatively nonviolent revolution would require fraternisation with military forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article1555 Daniel Jakopovich: Revolution and the Party in Gramsci's Thought: A Modern Application.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Ernesto Che Guevara]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Frantz Fanon]] and [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] were fervent critics of nonviolence, arguing variously that nonviolence and pacifism are an attempt to impose the morals of the [[bourgeoisie]] upon the [[proletariat]], that violence is a necessary accompaniment to revolutionary change or that the right to self-defense is fundamental. Note, for example, the complaint of Malcolm X that "I believe it's a crime for anyone being brutalized to continue to accept that brutality without doing something to defend himself."&lt;ref&gt;X, Malcolm and Alex Haley:''"The Autobiography of Malcolm X"'', page 366. Grove Press, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Orwell]] argued that the nonviolent resistance strategy of Gandhi could be effective in countries with "a free press and the right of assembly", which could make it possible "not merely to appeal to outside opinion, but to bring a mass movement into being, or even to make your intentions known to your adversary"; but he was skeptical of Gandhi's approach being effective in the opposite sort of circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George. ''Reflections on Gandhi'', Partisan Review, January 1949.  Found at http://www.orwell.ru/library/reviews/gandhi/english/e_gandhi on 21 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reinhold Niebuhr]] similarly affirmed Gandhi's approach while criticising aspects of it. He argued, "The advantage of non-violence as a method of expressing moral goodwill lies in the fact that it protects the agent against the resentments which violent conflict always creates in both parties to a conflict, and it proves this freedom of resentment and ill-will to the contending party in the dispute by enduring more suffering than it causes." However, Niebuhr also held, "The differences between violent and non-violent methods of coercion and resistance are not so absolute that it would be possible to regard violence as a morally impossible instrument of social change."&lt;ref&gt;Niebuhr, Reinhold. ''[[Moral Man and Immoral Society]]'', Charles Scribner's Sons. 1932. Chapter 9.  Found at http://www.colorado.edu/ReligiousStudies/chernus/4800/MoralManAndImmoralSociety/Section6.htm on 21 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of repression of radical [[African American]] groups in the United States during the 1960s, [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] member [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]] said of the nonviolent tactics of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The concept of nonviolence is a false ideal. It presupposes the existence of compassion and a sense of justice on the part of one's adversary. When this adversary has everything to lose and nothing to gain by exercising justice and compassion, his reaction can only be negative."&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;Jackson, George. Soledad Brother: The Prison Letters of George Jackson. Lawrence Hill Books, 1994. {{ISBN|1-55652-230-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;Walters, Wendy W. At Home in Diaspora. U of Minnesota Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8166-4491-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Malcolm X also clashed with civil rights leaders over the issue of nonviolence, arguing that violence should not be ruled out if no option remained.

In his book ''How Nonviolence Protects the State'', [[anarchist]] [[Peter Gelderloos]] criticises nonviolence as being ineffective, racist, statist, patriarchal, tactically and strategically inferior to militant activism, and deluded.&lt;ref name="Gelderloos"&gt;Gelderloos, Peter. ''How Nonviolence Protects the State''. Boston: [[South End Press]], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Gelderloos claims that traditional histories whitewash the impact of nonviolence, ignoring the involvement of militants in such movements as the [[Indian independence movement]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and falsely showing Gandhi and King as being their respective movement's most successful activists.&lt;ref name="Gelderloos"/&gt;{{rp|7–12}} He further argues that nonviolence is generally advocated by privileged white people who expect "oppressed people, many of whom are people of color, to suffer patiently under an inconceivably greater violence, until such time as the Great White Father is swayed by the movement's demands or the pacifists achieve that legendary 'critical mass.'"&lt;ref name="Gelderloos"/&gt;{{rp|23}} On the other hand, anarchism also includes a section committed to nonviolence called [[anarcho-pacifism]].&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962"&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'' (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence "Resisting the Nation State, the pacifist and anarchist tradition" by Geoffrey Ostergaard]&lt;/ref&gt; The main early influences were the thought of [[Henry David Thoreau]]&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"/&gt; and [[Leo Tolstoy]] while later the ideas of [[Mohandas Gandhi]] gained importance.&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"/&gt; It developed "mostly in Holland, [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]], before and during the [[Second World War]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=George Woodcock|first=George|last=Woodstock|title=Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements|year=1962|quote=Finally, somewhat aside from the curve that runs from anarchist individualism to anarcho-syndicalism, we come to Tolstoyanism and to pacifist anarchism that appeared, mostly in the [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the United states, before and after the Second World War and which has continued since then in the deep in the anarchist involvement in the protests against nuclear armament.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficacy of nonviolence was also challenged by some anti-capitalist protesters advocating a "[[diversity of tactics]]" during street demonstrations across Europe and the US following [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|the anti-World Trade Organization protests in Seattle, Washington in 1999]]. American [[feminism|feminist]] writer [[D. A. Clarke]], in her essay "A Woman With A Sword," suggests that for nonviolence to be effective, it must be "practiced by those who could easily resort to force if they chose."

Nonviolence advocates see some truth in this argument: Gandhi himself said often that he could teach nonviolence to a violent person but not to a coward and that true nonviolence came from renouncing violence, not by not having any to renounce.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Advocates responding to criticisms of the efficacy of nonviolence point to the success of non-violent struggles even against the Nazi regimes in [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|Denmark]] and even in [[Rosenstrasse protest|Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nathan Stoltzfus]], ''Resistance of the Heart: Intermarriage and the Rosenstrasse Protest in Nazi Germany'', [[Rutgers University Press]] (March 2001) {{ISBN|0-8135-2909-3}} (paperback: 386 pages)&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan found that nonviolent revolutions are twice as effective as violent ones and lead to much greater degrees of democratic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Civil Resistance Works, The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict", New York: Columbia University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

A 2016 study finds that "increasing levels of globalization are positively associated with the emergence of nonviolent campaigns, while negatively influencing the probability of violent campaigns. Integration into the world increases the popularity of peaceful alternatives to achieve political goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Globalization and contentious politics: A comparative analysis of nonviolent and violent campaigns|url = http://cmp.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/01/21/0738894215623073|journal = Conflict Management and Peace Science|volume = 35|issue = 4|date = 2016-01-22|issn = 0738-8942|pages = 315-335|doi = 10.1177/0738894215623073|language = en|first = Süveyda|last = Karakaya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2681">A '''notion''' in [[philosophy]] is a reflection in the [[mind]] of [[reality|real]] [[object (philosophy)|object]]s and [[phenomena]] in their [[essence|essential]] features and relations.  Notions are usually described in terms of scope and content. This is because notions are often created in response to [[empirical]] [[observations]] (or [[experiment]]s) of covarying trends among variables.

''Notion'' is the common translation for ''Begriff'' as used by [[Hegel]] in his [[Science of Logic#Introduction|Science of Logic]] (1816).

== Primitive notion ==
A [[primitive notion]] is used in [[logic]] or [[mathematics]] as an undefined term or concept at the foundation of an axiomatic system to be constructed. 

However, in philosophy the term "primitive notion" has historical content. For example, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] wrote ''De Alphabeto Cogitationum Humanarum'' ([[English language|English]]: ''An Alphabet for Human Thought''). Jaap Maat (2004) reviewed Leibniz for ''Philosophical Languages of the 17th Century''. According to Leibniz, "The alphabet of human thought is a catalogue of primitive notions, or those we cannot render clearer by any definitions." Maat explains, "a thing which is known without other intermediate notions can be considered to be primitive," and further, "a primitive notion is said to be conceived through itself".

Another example is in the ''Meditations'' of [[René Descartes]]:
:I think that there are certain primitive notions in us which are like originals. There are very few such notions. For apart from the most general notions of being, number, duration, etc which apply to everything that we can conceive, we have only the notion of extension that is specifically for the body, and from that flow the notions of shape and movement; and for the soul on its own we have only the concept of thought, which includes perceptions of the understanding and inclinations of the will. Finally, for the body and soul together, we have only the concept of their union, on which depends the notion of the soul's power to move the body and the body's power to act on the soul by causing its sensations and passions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Desmond M. Clarke]] (2003) ''Descartes's Theory of Mind'', page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

:"[Descartes'] claim that mind-body unity is a primitive notion on a par with the primitive notions of thinking and extended substance..."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Garber (1992) ''Descartes' Metaphysical Physics'', page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3844">{{for|the Japanese lexical law|Ōno's lexical law}}

'''Ohno's law''' was proposed by a Japanese-American biologist [[Susumu Ohno]], saying that the [[gene]] content of the [[mammal]]ian [[species]] has been conserved over species not only in the [[DNA]] content but also in the genes themselves. That is, nearly all mammalian species have conserved the [[X chromosome]] from their primordial X chromosome of a common ancestor.&lt;ref name=Ohno67&gt;Ohno S (1967). ''Sex Chromosomes and sex-linked genes.'' Berlin:Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence ==
As a [[Cell biology|cytological]] evidence, in first, mammalian X chromosomes in various species, including [[human]] and [[mouse]], have nearly the same size, with the content of about 5% of the genome. Second, for individual [[Locus (genetics)|gene loci]], a number of X-linked genes are common through mammalian species.  Examples are found in [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] (G6PD), a gene for polypeptide of [[antihemophilic globulin]] (AHG or [[Factor VIII]]) in [[Haemophilia A|hemophilia A]] and [[Haemophilia B|B]], and plasma thromboplastin component gene (PTC or [[Factor IX]]). Moreover, no instances were found where an [[Sex linkage|X-linked]] gene in one species was located on an [[autosome]] in the other species.&lt;ref name=Ohno67 /&gt;

== Conservation mechanisms ==
The content of a chromosome would be changed mainly by mutation after duplication of the chromosome and translocation with other chromosomes. However, in mammals, since the chromosomal [[Sex-determination system|sex-determination]] mechanism would have been established in their earlier stages of [[evolution]], [[polyploidy]] would have not occurred due to its incompatibility with the sex-determining mechanism. Moreover, X-autosome [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]] would have been prohibited because it might have resulted in detrimental effects for survival to the organism. Thus in mammals, the content of X chromosomes has been conserved after typical 2 round duplication events at early ancestral stages of evolution, at the fish or amphibia ([[2R hypothesis]]).&lt;ref name=Ohno67 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ohno70&gt;Ohno S (1970). ''Evolution by Gene Duplication.'' London: Allen and Unwin, {{ISBN|0-04-575015-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contradicting and supportive evidence ==
Genes on the long arm of the human X are contained in the monotreme X and genes on the short arm of the human X are distributed on the autosomes of marsupials.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;Watson JM, Riggs A, Graves JA (1992). "Gene mapping studies confirm the homology between the platypus X and echidna X1 chromosomes and identify a conserved ancestral monotreme X chromosome". ''Chromosoma'' 101(10): 596–601, {{PMID|1424984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ohno commented to the result that [[monotreme]]s and [[marsupial]]s were not considered to be ancestors of true mammals, but they have diverged very early from the main line of mammals.&lt;ref name=Ohno93&gt;Ohno S (1993). "Patterns in genome evolution". ''Curr Opin Genet Dev'' 3(6): 911–914, {{PMID|8118217}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chloride channel]] gene (''CLCN4'') was mapped to the human X but on chromosome 7 of C57BL/6 mice, species of [[House Mouse|''Mus musculus'']], though the gene is located on X of [[Algerian Mouse|''Mus spretus'']] and [[rat]].&lt;ref name=Palmer&gt;Palmer S, Perry J, Ashworth A (1995). "A contravention of ohno's law in mice". ''Nat Genet'' 10(4): 472–476, {{PMID|7670497}}, {{DOI|10.1038/ng0895-472}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oppositional gaze''' is a political rebellion and resistance against the repression of black people's right to a [[gaze]]; and it is through these looking relations that independent black cinema develops.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminism and Visual Cultural Reader.|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=Amelia Jones|year=1992|isbn=9780415543705|location=New York: Routledge, 2003|pages=94–105|chapter=The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectator|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''oppositional gaze'' was coined by feminist, scholar and social activist [[bell hooks]] in 1992. It is a work of [[feminist film theory]], which criticizes the [[male gaze]] through [[Michel Foucault]]'s 'relations of power'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; hooks asserts "there is power in looking".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The oppositional gaze encompasses modes of looking and looking back&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which employ reflexive gazes such as:  
* The shared gaze&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The repressed gaze&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* White supremacist capitalist imperialist dominating gaze&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Phallocentric gaze&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Black male gaze&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Interrogation gazes&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* Gaze of Recognition&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==
The concept was first developed as a critique of the [[male gaze]] by [[bell hooks]] in her essay "The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectators".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  hooks posits the power of the [[gaze]] from a black body as repressed, denied, and ultimately interrogating.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through critical discussion around black women and cinema, the oppositional gaze enters as the counterpart to reinforcing white supremacy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Subsequently, black films developed in response to the stagnant stereotypes of white-dominated cinema. It is critical to note that even in this realm, the concerns around gender relations reinforce an imaginative moment of [[Phallocentrism|phallocentric]] power by black men, a power not disseminated toward black women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] theory, modes of power and looking relations are contextualized within the [[mirror stage]]. This stage subsequently produces the narcissistic [[libido]] and the alienating function of the 'I' "...which will mark with its rigid structure the subject's entire mental development. Thus, to break out of the circle of the ''Innenwelt'' into the ''Umwelt'' generates the inexhaustible quadrature of the ego's verifications".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Critical and Cultural Theory Reader|last=Easthope|first=Antony, and Kate McGowan|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=Maidenhead: Open UP, 2004|pages=71–80|chapter=Jacques Lacan from 'The Mirror Stage' (1949)|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, hook's first encounter with Sapphire from [[Amos 'n' Andy]] "...explored both the negation of black female representation in cinema and television and our rejection of these images. [Sapphire's] black female image was not the body of desire. There was nothing to see. She was not us".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lacan examines this dual relationship, noting that the [[mirror stage]] is "...far from a phenomenon that occurs in the development of the child".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lacan.com/seminars1.htm|title=Jacques Lacan - the seminars of Jacques Lacan|website=lacan.com|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, placing the black female spectator in a paradigm of ''méconnaissances'', where their image was explained and reiterated without them looking. As hooks concludes on the black characterization of Sapphire, "How could we long to be there when our image, visually constructed, was so ugly".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Black female spectatorship ==
In "The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectators",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; hooks gives the rubric that black woman are not only underrepresented in film, but they are also not allowed to 'look' either.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://womenandmediafa2012.blogspot.ca/2012/09/the-male-gaze-and-oppositional-gaze.html|title=The Male Gaze and the Oppositional Gaze|website=womenandmediafa2012.blogspot.ca|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking implores a sense of power that is removed from the black female body, to play the role of object in direct relation to white female existence.

In 2015, [[Viola Davis]] was quoted by [[Entertainment Weekly]] saying, "[[Toni Morrison]] said that as soon as a character of color is introduced in a story imagination stops…I mean, I’m a black woman from Central Falls, Rhode Island. I’m [[Dark skin|dark-skinned]]. I’m quirky. I’m shy. I’m strong. I’m guarded. I’m weak at times. I’m sensual. I’m not overtly sexual. I am so many things in so many ways, and I will never see myself on screen”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://the-toast.net/2015/09/29/anatomy-of-a-black-actress-viola-davis/|title=Anatomy of a Black Actress: Viola Davis|last=Sylla|first=Fanta|date=2015-09-29|website=The Toast|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is beneath this very umbrella that hooks' concept of the oppositional gaze is present, as [[Viola Davis|Davis]], a decorated actress and producer, states the realities of what it means to be a black woman in film. This statement came after [[Viola Davis|Davis]] was awarded as the first black woman to win the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series]].

== Male gaze ==
"‘The Oppositional Gaze’&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; by bell hooks is the rejection of [[Laura Mulvey]]’s paper, ''Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema'' (1975)".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media and Cultural Studies: Keywords|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|publisher=Meenakshi Gigi Durham and Douglas Kellner|year=|isbn=|location=2001; Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2006|pages=342–352|chapter=Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema.|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jennylovespeach.wordpress.com/2012/11/17/the-oppositional-gaze/|title=The Oppositional Gaze|last=jennylovespeach|date=2012-11-17|website=jennylovespeach|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulvey's text analyses Lacan's [[mirror stage]] within film, concluding that [[subjectivity]] is "the birth of the long love affair/ despair between image and self-image which has found such intensity of expression in film and such joyous recognition in the cinema audience".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She furthers this point by criticizing the "male movie star's glamorous characteristics" as not subject to an objectifying gaze, but rather a more powerful stance as the '[[Ego ideal|ideal ego]]' developed in the beginning stages of recognition in front of the mirror.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mulvey defines the "split between active/ male and passive/ female" as the pleasure in looking through which the determining [[male gaze]] stylizes the female figure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Bell hooks|hooks]] rebuts this claim stating, "Black female spectators 'actively' chose not to identify with the film's imaginary subject because such identification was disenabling".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The concept of seeing one's self in opposition to the '[[Ego ideal|ideal ego]]' must begin with recognition of one's body as comparably different. Black female representation in film exists primarily in opposition to the white woman's body. Thus, black women often remain in search of a [[mirror stage]] because they metaphorically have yet to see true representations of themselves. [[Bell hooks|hooks]] gives an example of this rare recognition through two characters in the film "Passion of Remembrance". She writes, "Dressing to go to a party, Louise and Maggie claim the '[[gaze]]'. Looking at one another, staring in mirrors, they appear completely focused on their encounter with black femaleness".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mulvey's criticisms present exclusionary perspectives which inundate the white female body as a totalizing categorization of all women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Not only is the representation of Black women significantly marginalized within film but they are further misrepresented as stereotyped objects to which the [[male gaze]] is rarely, if ever applied. This concept leads [[Bell hooks|hooks]] to ask, "Are we really to imagine that feminist theorists writing only about images of white women... do not 'see' the whiteness of the image?".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The oppositional gaze serves as "a gesture of resistance" to not only the male gaze but also toward the oppression of minorities through cinema by the all-inclusive [[gendering]] of woman. This gaze criticizes the doubling effect of objectification by "turning away [as] one way to protest, to reject negation".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Feminine gaze ==
[[Judith Butler]] theorizes the feminine gaze as "a pervasive heterosexism in feminist theory".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Undoing Gender|last=Butler|first=Judith|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=New York: Routledge, 2004|pages=204–231|chapter=The Question of Social Transformation.|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her essay "The Question of Social Transformation",&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Butler states, "Through performativity, dominant and nondominant gender norms are equalized. But some of those performative accomplishments claim the place of nature or claim the place of symbolic necessity...".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These theories criticize the male gaze and its objectification of 'women' as it predominantly excludes more than just the Black oppositional gaze but further problematizes the [[subjectivity]] of gendering male verses female. Furthermore, 'woman' as [[heterogenous]] sex object functions for and within the patriarchy, reinforcing "white supremacist capitalist imperialist dominating '[[gaze]]'"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Olympia's Maid ==
The surrounding controversy of [[Édouard Manet]]'s [[Olympia (Manet)|''Olympia'']] (1863) highlights the confrontational gaze as defiant and critical within the context of its time. However, there is a second gaze within this painting that is "cooperating with the West's construction of not-white women as not-to-be-seen".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader|last=O'Grady|first=Lorraine|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=174–187|chapter=Olympia's Maid: Reclaiming Black Female Subjectivity|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]], pegged as a prostitute, makes direct eye contact with viewers while her 'black servant' "looms in the shadows" as background.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In her essay titled, "Olympia's Maid: Reclaiming Black Female Subjectivity",&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Lorraine O'Grady]] states, "...only the white body remains as the object of a voyeuristic, fetishizing [[male gaze]]. The not-white body has been made opaque by a blank stare...".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

This "blank stare" through a body of [[alterity]] reiterates bell hooks definition of the oppositional gaze. The deliberate characterization of the 'black servant' is ideologically rooted in the constructs of black female identity as [[Mammy archetype|Mammy]], [[Jezebel]], and Sapphire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Carolyn M|date=2008-01-01|title=Mammy, Jezebel, Sapphire and their homegirls: Developing an "oppositional gaze" toward the images of Black women|url=https://works.bepress.com/DrCarolynWest/15/}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Lorraine O'Grady|O'Grady]] declares, "Forget euphemisms. Forget 'tonal contrast'. We know what she is meant for: she is Jezebel and Mammy, [[Prostitution|prostitute]] and [[The Female Eunuch|female eunuch]], the two-in-one".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Olympia's maid serves not only as the maid but as the opposing body of difference to whiteness; both visually and sexually. Within [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] theory, [[people of color]] are "symbolically and even theoretically excluded from sexual difference".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Olympia, although defiant as gazing prostitute, remains as a unitary sign of the female body in the West. "It has an obverse and a reverse".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As hooks says, "…[this] image functions solely to reaffirm and reinscribe patriarchy".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These comparative power relations conjure up opposing forces that transfer agency from one side to the 'other'. Michel Foucault insists that there is the possibility of resistance to domination and therefore an oppositional gaze exists. While Olympia confronts the male gaze, her maid confronts the repressed gaze, the oppositional gaze, and the gaze of recognition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2039">An '''ordinary law''' is a normal [[law]], generally distinguished from a [[constitutional law]], [[organic law]], or other similar law. Typically, ordinary laws are subordinate to constitutional and organic laws, and are more easily changed than constitutional or organic laws, though that should not be assumed to be the case in all jurisdictions. (For example, the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] has ruled that Spain's [[Organic Law (Spain)|Organic Laws]] are not hierarchically superior to ordinary laws, but simply apply to different matters.&lt;ref&gt;Sentencia de 13 de febrero de 1981, Tribunal Constitucional de España&lt;/ref&gt;) Ordinary laws often govern areas beyond the scope of constitutional or organic laws.

Normally, in a democracy, an ordinary law must first obtain a [[majority|simple majority]] of a [[congress]], [[parliament]], or other legislature, and then be signed into law by the representative of [[executive power]]. The process leading to a legislative vote may vary vastly from one jurisdiction to another: the process may be initiated by either house of a [[bicameral legislature]] or from the sole house of a [[unicameral legislature]]; from the [[head of government]] or [[head of state]]; or by popular [[initiative]]. Different jurisdictions may allow ordinary laws to be proposed by one or all of these means, and may have restrictions on which body may take the initiative for certain types of laws (for example, in some bicameral systems, tax-related laws must begin in the lower chamber of the legislature). In some jurisdictions, the legislature has a means to override an executive [[veto]] by a [[supermajority]], or the voting populace have the means to override a law by a [[referendum]].

Under [[federalism|federal]] systems, ordinary laws may be created at the level of a [[sovereign state]] but also by its constituent components: for example, by [[states of the United States]] or [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] of [[Spain]].

'''Para Tattva''' ([[Sanskrit]]: '''पर तत्त्व'''&lt;!-- ref:  http://spokensanskrit.de/ --&gt;) is a [[Sanskrit]] phrase meaning “Supreme Truth,” as studied, realized, worshipped and revealed by the saints of India's [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic tradition]].  The root ''tat'' is equivalent to the English word “that,” while the suffix ''-tva'' is used like our suffix “-ness,” giving a sense of “that-ness,” commonly understood as truth or principle.  ''Para'' is simply “supreme,” “transcendental” or “absolute,” in this context describing the principles of truth in a wholesome context.

Two very common conceptions in this day and age amongst students of the [[Vedas]] (which includes the core scriptures Rg, Sama, Yajur and Atharva, and may also extend into the vast body of associated peripheral works) are the [[Hindu]] tattvas of [[Brahman]] and [[Paramatman]], which may be understood respectively as the witness-consciousness (Self as knower) and the Supersoul (supercontrolling Godhead).  The mainstream Hindu social class in traditional Vedic culture is the functionary priesthood, and includes teachers and scribes as well as medical practitioners.  Those Brahmanas who tend to be theonomous in nature but who relate to Deity more as the absolute Self in its wise or gnostic capacity may be called Brahma-vadis, meaning practitioners of Brahma-vada, the endorsement of Brahma-tattva.

Brahmanas and [[Yogi]]s (deeply meditative saints) who are more progressively theolatrous, whether exoterically or esoterically, may be called Paramatma-vadis.  Their relationship with the Deity advances beyond theoretical knowledge of Self into the dynamics of what may be called absolute civilization.  Their practice of cosmic consciousness comprehends ontological relationships between the Witness which is the relatively inferior Self and the supercontrolling Godhead, attunement with Whom is the prime requirement for entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven.

The [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] school of Vedic theology emphasizes a third significant phase of Para Tattva beyond Brahman and Paramatma.  Positioning themselves (the Vaishnavas) as authoritatively superior both socially and spiritually to a non-Vaishnavite Brahmin class, they claim that the real goal of a theistic saint is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, known as [[Bhagavan]].  Where Brahma-tattva tends to be perception oriented and Paramatma-tattva concerned with absolute functionality, the tattva of Bhagavan expands into explorations of quality, including and especially the superlative quality of glory which is the feature that reveals the Kingdom of Heaven, known to the Vaishnavas as [[Vaikunta|Vaikuntha]].

Once Bhagavan is recognized, reality may be comprehended sixfold, according to six essential qualities of divine personality.  Where [[Vishnu]] is the [[God the Father|Supreme Father]], Lord of Vaikuntha, He actually has a qualitatively superlative aspect, where He is known as Lord [[Rama]], the Supreme Personality of Godhead as personification of the highest quality of glory, Whose mood is actually more intimate and friendly.  On the other hand, where Vishnu's absolute fatherhood leans more toward the relatively impersonal functionality of Paramatma, He becomes represented as [[Shiva]], Who may be compared to the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]].  This phase is recognized by the Vaishnavas in terms of the quality of strength.

Backing down the qualitative ladder from Bhagavan Lord Rama's superlative glory, through the strength represented by Paramatma Shiva, our study returns to the quality of wisdom or knowledge personified by Brahma, who is the first created [[Son of God|Son of Father Vishnu]], and may therefore be compared to the [[Christ]].  Understanding this much, then, gives us half the picture of Para Tattva, and is the framework of what may be called the right-handed path.  Lord Rama (the original Vishnu) as Bhagavan is all-glorious, Shiva as Paramatma is all-powerful, and Brahma who is Brahma-tattva is all wise.  Three qualities, however, remain to be examined.

The Vedic tradition initially portrays reality as fourfold, and this qualitative framework may gradually be comprehended in a broader context once the left-handed path is added to the relatively simplistic design which begins beneath Brahma's position and extends upwardly beyond Lord Rama's kingdom.  The fourth aspect of Deity Whom we find beyond the glorious Rama is described by the Veda as the all-beautiful [[Krishna]], Whose alluring pastimes are lovingly worshipped by many devotees all over the world.  At the other extreme end of fourfold reality is a fifth entity known as [[Sudarshana Chakra|Sudarshana]], the original Chakra who is Lord Vishnu's weapon of absolute destruction and therefore represents the fifth quality of Bhagavan which is detachment.

Thus far we have covered five of six qualities of Bhagavan, which outline the traditional fourfold path:  beauty (Krishna), glory (Rama), strength (Shiva), knowledge (Brahma) and detachment (Sudarshana).  Now one last principle can be observed as connecting the two ends of our envisioned framework of reality, this being the quality of possession, which is personified by a lesser-known aspect of Bhagavan whose name is [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]].  Chaitanya is connected negatively through possessiveness to Sudarshana's detachment through his exhibition of renunciation, and positively through possessiveness to Krishna's beauty through loving devotion.  In this way, Bhagavan realization advances our initial studies of Para Tattva into a full-circle comprehension of quality.

However, it appears in none of the [[Canonical gospels]] of the [[New Testament]] but only in the non-canonical [[Gospel of Thomas]]. According to the [[Gospel of Thomas]] 98 Jesus said:
:''"The kingdom of the father is like a certain man who wanted to kill a powerful man. In his own house he drew his sword and stuck it into the wall in order to find out whether his hand could carry through. Then he slew the powerful man."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/gthlamb.html |title=Gospel of Thomas (Lambdin Translation) - The Nag Hammadi Library |publisher=Gnosis.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
The scholars of the [[Jesus Seminar]] gave the parable of the assassin a "pink" rating, indicating 
that it is in their opinion probably, but not certainly, an authentic saying of Jesus.  They were influenced by parallels with the parables of the tower builder&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|14:28–14:30||}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the warring king&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|14:31–14:32}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in the [[Gospel of Luke]] (see [[Counting the cost]]), and by the "scandalous nature of the image."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Walter Funk and Roy W. Hoover, ''The Five Gospels: What Did Jesus Really Say? the Search for the Authentic Words of Jesus'', HarperCollins, 1997, pp. 524–5&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Robert W. Funk|Robert Funk]], "[a]ttributing a parable to Jesus not attested in the canonical gospels and known only for a few years was an act of courage that demanded careful deliberation".&lt;ref name="p. 525"&gt;Robert Walter Funk and Roy W. Hoover, ''The Five Gospels: What Did Jesus Really Say? the Search for the Authentic Words of Jesus'', HarperCollins, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN006063040X&amp;id=SRI-c0Pf3soC&amp;pg=RA1-PA525&amp;lpg=RA1-PA525&amp;ots=vP-Bse1Hs8&amp;dq=%22parable+of+the+assassin%22&amp;sig=NiYQB6gaCpUu-I-0f2ErfFbcaDE#PRA1-PA525,M1 p. 525]&lt;/ref&gt;  This decision by the Seminar has been criticized for inconsistency, since the parallel parable of the warring king in Luke was ''not'' given a pink rating.&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig A. Evans]], Bruce D. Chilton, ''Authenticating the Words of Jesus'', Brill Academic Publishers, 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0391041630&amp;id=Y96yVkPLeioC&amp;pg=RA2-PA411&amp;lpg=RA2-PA411&amp;ots=H4i_fUkshX&amp;dq=%22parable+of+the+assassin%22&amp;sig=-TM9AM60786w4cZIOnSdEbQSWUw#PRA2-PA411,M1 p. 411]&lt;/ref&gt;  The authenticity of this parable has been attacked on the grounds that Jesus would not use a parable that glorifies [[murder]], and because of its use of the phrase "the kingdom of the father" which is not found in the canonical gospels.

==Meaning==
Like the Lucan parables of the warring king and the tower, this parable seems to concern "estimating the cost of an act or the capability to perform it successfully."{{Citation needed|date=December 2009|reason = dead link: http://www.bibletexts.com/texts/parables.htm#assassin }} In Mark 7:21–23, Jesus explains the idea of evil being rehearsed before taking place. "For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: all these evil things come from within, and defile the man."{{Or|date=November 2007}} According to some of the fellows of the Jesus Seminar, "the story line of the parable originally had to do with Davidic reversal, as in David and Goliath: the little guy bests the big guy by taking the precautions a prudent person would take before encountering the village bully".&lt;ref name="p. 525"/&gt; A similar message can be found in the [[parable of the strong man]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Altars to Greek gods were set up and animals prohibited to Jews were sacrificed on them.  The Olympian [[Zeus]] was placed on the altar of the Temple. Possession of [[Torah|Jewish scriptures]] was made a capital offense.

In the [[Middle Ages]] [[antisemitism in Europe]] was [[Religious antisemitism|religious]]. Although not part of [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|Catholic dogma]], many Christians, including members of the [[clergy]], held the Jewish people collectively responsible for killing [[Jesus]]. As stated in the ''[[Boston College]] Guide to Passion Plays'', "Over the course of time, Christians began to accept … that the Jewish people as a whole were responsible for killing Jesus. According to this interpretation, both the Jews present at Jesus Christ's death and the Jewish people collectively and for all time, have committed the sin of [[Jewish deicide|deicide]], or "god-killing". For 1900 years of Christian-Jewish history, the charge of deicide has led to hatred, violence against and murder of Jews in [[Europe]] and [[Americas|America]]."&lt;ref name=Paley&gt;Paley, Susan, and Koesters, Adrian Gibbons, eds.

During the [[High Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]] there was full-scale persecution in many places, with [[blood libel]]s, expulsions, [[forced conversion]]s and [[wiktionary:massacre|massacres]]. An underlying source of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious. Jews were frequently massacred and exiled from various European countries.  The persecution hit its first peak during the [[Crusades]]. In the [[First Crusade]] (1096) flourishing communities on the [[Rhine River|Rhine]] and the [[Danube River|Danube]] were utterly destroyed, a prime example being the [[Rhineland massacres]]. In the [[Second Crusade]] (1147) the Jews in [[France]] were subject to frequent massacres. The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the [[Shepherds' Crusade (1251)|Shepherds' Crusades of 1251]] and [[Shepherds' Crusade (1320)|1320]]. The Crusades were followed by expulsions, including in 1290, [[Edict of Expulsion|the banishing of all English Jews]]; in 1396, 100,000 Jews were expelled from France; and, in 1421 thousands were expelled from [[Austria]]. Many of the expelled Jews fled to [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaustcenterpgh.net/2-3.html |title=Why the Jews? – Black Death |publisher=Holocaustcenterpgh.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429065613/http://www.holocaustcenterpgh.net/2-3.html |archivedate=2007-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Black Death]] epidemics devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than a half of the population, Jews were taken as [[scapegoat#Political/sociological scapegoating|scapegoats]]. Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately [[well poisoning|poisoning wells]]. Hundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed by violence in the [[Black Death persecutions]]. Although [[Pope Clement VI]] tried to protect them by [[papal bull]] on July 6, 1348 - with another following later in 1348 - several months afterwards, 900 Jews were [[Strasbourg massacre|burnt alive in Strasbourg]], where the plague hadn't yet affected the city.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;See Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, ''La plus grande épidémie de Histoire'' ("The greatest epidemics in history"), in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' magazine, n°310, June 2006, p.47 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study finds that Jewish persecutions and expulsions increased with negative economic shocks and climactic variations in Europe over the period 1100-1600.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Jewish Persecutions and Weather Shocks: 1100-1800|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12331/abstract|journal = The Economic Journal|date = 2015-09-01|issn = 1468-0297|pages = n/an/a|doi = 10.1111/ecoj.12331|language = en|first = Robert Warren|last = Anderson|first2 = Noel D.|last2 = Johnson|first3 = Mark|last3 = Koyama}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the study argue that this stems from people blaming Jews for misfortunes and weak rulers going after Jewish wealth in times of fiscal crisis. The authors propose several explanations for why Jewish persecutions significantly declined after 1600:
* (1) there were simply fewer Jewish communities to persecute by the 17th century;
* (2) improved agricultural productivity, or, better-integrated markets may have reduced vulnerability to temperature shocks;
* (3) the rise of stronger states may have led to more robust protection for religious and ethnic minorities;
* (4) there were fewer negative temperature shocks.
* (5) the impact of the Reformation and the Enlightenment may have reduced antisemitic attitudes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
In the [[Papal States]], which existed until 1870, Jews were required to live only in specified neighborhoods called [[ghetto]]s.  Until the 1840s, they were required to regularly attend sermons urging their conversion to Christianity.  Only Jews were taxed to support state [[boarding school]]s for Jewish converts to Christianity.  It was illegal to convert from Christianity to Judaism.  Sometimes Jews were baptized involuntarily, and, even when such baptisms were illegal, forced to practice the Christian religion.  In many such cases, the state separated them from their families, of which the [[Edgardo Mortara]] account is one of the most widely publicized instances of acrimony between Catholics and Jews in the Papal States in the second half of the 19th century.

[[File:Banu Qurayza.png|thumb|200px|The [[Banu Qurayza|massacre of the Jewish Banu Qurayza]] in Arabia.]]
According to Mark R. Cohen, during the rise of [[Islam]], the first encounters between [[Muslim]]s and Jews resulted in friendship when the Jews of [[Medina]] gave [[Muhammad]] refuge. Conflict arose when Muhammad expelled certain Jewish tribes after they refused to swear their allegiance to him and aided the Meccan Pagans. He adds that this encounter was an exception rather than a rule.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Mark R. ''Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages'', [[Princeton University Press]], 1994, p. 163. {{ISBN|0-691-01082-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Jews living in Muslim lands, known as [[dhimmis]], were allowed to practice their religion and administer their internal affairs but were subjects to certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]] (1984). ''The Jews of Islam''. Princeton: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-00807-8}} pp.10,20&lt;/ref&gt; They had to pay the [[jizya]] (a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males) to Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), pp.10,20&lt;/ref&gt; Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule. They had several social and legal [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1987), p. 9, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, the [[Qur'an]] did not allow Muslims to force Jews to wear distinctive clothing. [[Obadiah the Proselyte]] reported in 1100 AD, that the [[Caliph]] had created this rule himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Scheiber|Scheiber, A.]] "The Origins of Obadiah, the Norman Proselyte" ''Journal of Jewish Studies'' (Oxford), Vol. 5, 1954, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Resentment toward Jews perceived as having attained too lofty a position in Islamic society also fueled antisemitism and massacres. In [[Moorish Spain]], ibn Hazm and [[Abu Ishaq]] focused their anti-Jewish writings on this allegation. This was also the chief motivation behind the [[1066 Granada massacre]], when "[m]ore than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day",&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, [[Meyer Kayserling]], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] in 1033, when 6,000 Jews were killed.&lt;ref name=Morris10&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]]. ''Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist–Arab Conflict, 1881–2001''. Vintage Books, 2001, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; There were further massacres in Fez in 1276 and 1465.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber (1986), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Zaydi|Zaydi imamate]] of [[Yemen]], Jews were also singled out for discrimination in the 17th century, which culminated in the general expulsion of all Jews from places in Yemen to the arid coastal plain of [[Tihamah]] and which became known as the [[Mawza Exile]].&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, pp. 714-ff.

The [[Damascus affair]] occurred in 1840 when a French [[monk]] and his servant disappeared in [[Damascus]]. Immediately following, a charge of [[ritual murder]] was brought against a large number of Jews in the city including children who were tortured. The consuls of the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Germany]] as well as [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities, Christians, Muslims and Jews all played a great role in this affair.&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, Jonathan: ''The Damascus Affair: 'Ritual Murder', Politics, and the Jews in 1840'' (Cambridge University Press, 1997) {{ISBN|0-521-48396-4}} p.1&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the Damascus affair, [[Pogroms]] spread through the Middle East and North Africa. Pogroms occurred in: Aleppo (1850, 1875), Damascus (1840, 1848, 1890), Beirut (1862, 1874), Dayr al-Qamar (1847), Jerusalem (1847), Cairo (1844, 1890, 1901–02), Mansura (1877), Alexandria (1870, 1882, 1901–07), Port Said (1903, 1908), Damanhur (1871, 1873, 1877, 1891), Istanbul (1870, 1874), Buyukdere (1864), Kuzguncuk (1866), Eyub (1868), Edirne (1872), Izmir (1872, 1874).&lt;ref&gt;Yossef Bodansky.

There was a massacre of Jews in [[Baghdad]] in 1828.&lt;ref name="Morris10"/&gt; There was another massacre in Barfurush in 1867.&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;

In 1839, in the eastern [[Persia]]n city of [[Meshed]], a mob burst into the [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish Quarter]], burned the synagogue, and destroyed the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]]. This is known as the [[Allahdad incident]]. It was only by forcible conversion that a massacre was averted.&lt;ref name="Patai"&gt;{{cite book |last=Patai |first=Raphael |title=Jadid al-Islam: The Jewish "New Muslims" of Meshhed |publisher=Wayne State University Press |year=1997 |location=Detroit |isbn=0-8143-2652-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Palestine there were riots and pogroms against Jews in [[1920 Nebi Musa riots|1920]] and [[Jaffa riots|1921]]. Tensions over the [[Western Wall]] in Jerusalem led to the [[1929 Palestine riots]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ovendale |first=Ritchie |title=The Origins of the Arab–Israeli Wars |year=2004 |publisher=[[Pearson Education]] |isbn=0-58282320-X |pages=g.71 |chapter=The "Wailing Wall" Riots |quote=The Mufti tried to establish Muslim rights and the Jews were deliberately antagonized by building works and noise.}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose [[1929 Hebron massacre|main victims]] were the ancient Jewish community at Hebron which came to an end.

In 1941, following [[Rashid Ali]]'s pro-[[Axis Powers|Axis]] coup, riots known as the ''[[Farhud]]'' broke out in [[Baghdad]] in which approximately 180 Jews were killed and about 240 were wounded, 586 Jewish-owned businesses were looted and 99 Jewish houses were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Itamar (2001).

[[File:Zeibak.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Border police discovered on March 2, 1974, the bodies of (clockwise from top left: Fara Zeibak, Mazal Zeibak, Eva Saad and Lulu Zeibak, in a cave in the [[Zabdani Mountains]].]]

During the [[Holocaust]], the [[Middle East]] was in turmoil. Britain prohibited Jewish immigration to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. In [[Cairo]] the Jewish [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] (also known as the Stern Gang) assassinated [[Lord Moyne]] in 1944 fighting as part of its campaign against British closure of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to Jewish immigration, complicating British-Arab-Jewish relations. While the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] were fighting for the [[oil]]-rich region, the Mufti of Jerusalem [[Amin al-Husayni]] staged a pro-Nazi coup in [[Iraq]] and organized the [[Farhud]] pogrom which marked the turning point for about 150,000 Iraqi Jews who, following this event and the hostilities generated by the [[1948 Arab–Israeli war|war with Israel in 1948]], were targeted for violence, persecution, boycotts, confiscations, and near complete expulsion in 1951. The coup failed and the mufti fled to [[Berlin]], where he actively supported [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. In [[Egypt]], with a Jewish population of about 75,000, young [[Anwar Sadat]] was imprisoned for conspiring with the Nazis and promised them that "no British soldier would leave Egypt alive" (see [[Military history of Egypt during World War II]]) leaving the Jews of that region defenseless. In the French [[Vichy France|Vichy]] territories of [[Algeria]] and [[Syria]] plans had been drawn up for the liquidation of their Jewish populations were the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] powers to triumph.

The tensions of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] were also a factor in the rise of animosity to Jews all over the Middle East, as hundreds of thousands of Jews fled as [[Jewish refugees|refugees]], the main waves being soon after the 1948 and 1956 wars. In reaction to the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, the Egyptian government expelled almost 25,000 Egyptian Jews and confiscated their property, and sent approximately 1,000 more Jews to prisons and detention camps. The population of Jewish communities of Muslim Middle East and North Africa was reduced from about 900,000 in 1948 to less than 8,000 today.

On March 2, 1974, the bodies of four [[Syrian Jewish]] girls were discovered by border police in a cave in the [[Zabdani Mountains]] northwest of Damascus. Fara Zeibak 24, her sisters Lulu Zeibak 23, Mazal Zeibak 22 and their cousin Eva Saad 18, had contracted with a band of smugglers to flee from Syria to Lebanon and eventually to Israel. The girl’s bodies were found raped, murdered and mutilated. The police also found the remains of two Jewish boys, Natan Shaya 18 and Kassem Abadi 20, victims of an earlier massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Saul S. (1989).

[[File:Massacre of Jews in Lietūkis garage.jpeg|thumb|[[Kaunas pogrom]] in [[German occupation of Lithuania during World War II|German-occupied Lithuania]], June 1941]]
The persecution of Jews reached its most destructive form in the policies of [[Nazi Germany]], which made the destruction of the Jews a priority, culminating in the killing of approximately 6,000,000 Jews during [[the Holocaust]] from 1941 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucy Dawidowicz|Dawidowicz, Lucy]]. ''The War Against the Jews'', Bantam, 1986.p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally, the Nazis used death squads, the [[Einsatzgruppen]], to conduct massive open-air killings of Jews in territory that they conquered. By 1942, the Nazi leadership decided to implement the [[Final Solution]], the [[genocide]] of the Jews of [[Europe]], and to increase the pace of the Holocaust by establishing [[extermination camps]] specifically to kill Jews as well as other undesirables such as people who openly opposed Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Manvell, Roger ''Goering'' New York:1972 Ballantine Books – War Leader Book #8 Ballantine's Illustrated History of the Violent Century&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6724481.stm |title=Ukrainian mass Jewish grave found |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-06-05 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was an industrial method of genocide. Millions of Jews who had been confined to diseased and massively overcrowded [[ghettos]] were transported (often by train) to [[extermination camps|death camps]], where some were herded into a specific location (often a [[gas chamber]]), then killed with either gassing or shooting. Other prisoners simply committed suicide, unable to go on after witnessing the horrors of camp life.  Afterward, their bodies were often searched for any valuable or useful materials, such as [[gold]] fillings or [[hair]], and their remains were then buried in mass graves or burned. Others were interned in the camps where they were given little food and disease was common.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum103&gt;Berenbaum, Michael. ''The World Must Know," United States Holocaust Museum'', 2006, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Escapes from the camps were few, but not unknown. The few [[Auschwitz]] escapes that succeeded were made possible by the Polish underground inside the camp and local people outside.&lt;ref name=Linn20&gt;[[Ruth Linn|Linn, Ruth]]. ''Escaping Auschwitz. A culture of forgetting'', Cornell University Press, 2004, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, the Auschwitz commandant reported that "the local population is fanatically Polish and … prepared to take any action against the hated [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] camp personnel. Every prisoner who managed to escape can count on help the moment he reaches the wall of a first Polish farmstead."&lt;ref name=Swiebocki505&gt;Swiebocki, Henryk.

For much of the 19th century, [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], which included much of [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], [[Moldova]] and [[Baltic states]], contained the world's largest Jewish population. From [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]'s reign until the end of [[Tsar]]ist rule in Russia, many Jews were often restricted to the Jewish [[Pale of Settlement]] and they were also banned from many jobs and locations.  Jews were subject to racist laws, such as the [[May Laws]], and they were also targeted in hundreds of violent anti-Jewish riots, called [[pogrom]]s, which received unofficial state support. It was during this period that a hoax document alleging a global Jewish [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]], ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', was created.

The Czarist government implemented programs which ensured that the Jews would remain isolated. However, the government tolerated their religious and national institutions as well as their right to emigrate. The restrictions and discriminatory laws drove many Russian Jews to embrace [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] causes. However, following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] many politically active Jews forfeited their Jewish identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/the-jews-in-the-soviet-union-since-1917--by-nora-levin--the-jews-of-the-soviet-union--by-benjamin-pinkus-7646nska4.html |title=The Jews in the Soviet Union Since 1917, by Nora Levin; The Jews of the Soviet Union, by Benjamin Pinkus |publisher=Commentarymagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-22 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Leon Trotsky]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Jews] considered themselves neither Jews nor Russians but socialists. To them, Jews were not a nation but a class of exploiters whose fate it was to dissolve and assimilate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the aftermath of Czarist Russia, Jews found themselves in a tragic predicament. Conservative Russians saw them as a disloyal and subversive element and the radicals viewed the Jews as a doomed social class.&lt;ref&gt;The Jews in the Soviet Union Since 1917, Nora Levin&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
{{main|Antisemitism in the Soviet Union}}
Even though many of the [[Old Bolshevik]]s were ethnically Jewish, they sought to uproot [[Judaism]] and [[Zionism]] and established the ''[[Yevsektsiya]]'' in order to achieve this goal. By the end of the 1940s, the [[Communist]] leadership of the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]] had liquidated almost all Jewish organizations, with the exception of a few [[tokenism|token]] [[synagogue]]s. These synagogues were then placed under police surveillance, both openly and through the use of informants{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}.

The campaign of 1948–1953 against so-called "[[rootless cosmopolitan]]s," the alleged "[[Doctors' plot]]," the rise of "[[Zionology]]" and subsequent activities of official organizations such as the [[Anti-Zionist committee of the Soviet public]] were officially carried out under the banner of "[[anti-Zionism]],", and by the mid-1950s the state persecution of Soviet Jews emerged as a major [[human rights]] issue in the West as well as domestically.

==Apartheid South Africa==
{{Main|Antisemitism in South Africa}}
During the 1930s, many Nationalist Party leaders and wide sections of the [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner people]] came strongly under the influence of the Nazi movement which dominated Germany from 1933 to 1945. There were many reasons for this. Germany was the traditional enemy of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and whoever opposed Britain was seen as a friend of the Nationalists. Many Nationalists, moreover, believed that the opportunity to re-establish their lost republic would come with the defeat of the [[British Empire]] in the international arena. The more belligerent Hitler became, the higher hopes rose that a new era of Afrikanerdom was about to dawn.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715031456/http://www.anc.org.za/books/reich4.html|title=The Rise of the South African Reich - Chapter 4|date=15 July 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] of D F Malan closely associated itself with the policies of the Nazis. Jewish immigration from [[Eastern Europe]] was controlled under the Aliens Act and it soon came to an end during this period. Although Jews were accorded status as Europeans, they were not accepted into white society. The Kelvin Grove sports club, for example, had an exclusive Europeans Only and No Jews policy until recent times. Some 11 such sports clubs had similar policies. Many Jews lived in mixed race areas such as District Six, from where they were forcibly removed in order to make way for a whites-only development.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 1936, [[Hendrick Verwoerd]] joined a deputation of six professors who were protesting against the admission to South Africa of Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. Following the demands of the Nationalist Party, Eric Louw, later Foreign Minister, introduced another anti-Semitic bill that strongly resembled Nazi legislation - the Aliens Amendment and Immigration Bill of 1939. His bill was a means of suppressing all Jews. This bill suggested that Jews threatened to overpower [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in the business world, that they were innately cunning and manipulative and that they were also a danger to society. To support his claim, Louw maintained that Jews were involved in the [[Russian Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] and therefore intended to spread [[Communism]] worldwide. This bill defined Jews as anyone with parents who were at least partly Jewish regardless of actual religious faith or practices." &lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Lee Jamison, The Nazi Influence in the Formation of Apartheid in South Africa, Concord Review
&lt;/ref&gt;

Another organization with which the Nationalists found much in common during the thirties was the 'South African Gentile National Socialist Movement', headed by [[Johannes von Strauss von Moltke]], whose objective was to combat and destroy the alleged 'perversive influence of the Jews in [[economics]], [[culture]], [[religion]], [[ethics]], and [[Power (international relations)|statecraft]] and to re-establish European [[Aryan race|Aryan]] control in South Africa for the welfare of the Christian peoples of South Africa'.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

During the 1960s, [[Oswald Mosley]], the British fascist leader, was a frequent visitor to South Africa, where he was received by the Prime Minister and other members of the Cabinet. At one time, Mosley had two functioning branches of his organization in South Africa, and one of his supporters, Derek Alexander, was stationed in [[Johannesburg]] as his main agent.

Upon Verwoerd's [[assassination]] in 1966, [[BJ Vorster]] was elected by the National Party to replace him. While Vorster had been a supporter of Hitler during WWII, his policy towards Jews in his own country, however, can best be described as ambivalent.
 
The 1980s saw the rise of [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] groups such as the [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] under [[Eugene Terreblanche]]. The AWB modeled itself after Hitler's National Socialist Party replete with fascist regalia and an emblem resembling the [[swastika]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

A '''post-war period''' or '''postwar period''' is the interval immediately following the end of a [[war]]. A post-war period can become an [[interwar period]] or [[interbellum]], when a war between the same parties resumes at a later date (e.g., the period between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]). By contrast, a post-war period marks the cessation of conflict entirely.

In [[Western world|Western]] usage, references to the '''post-war era''' or '''postwar era''' (sometimes capitalized) usually refer to the time since the end of [[World War II]], although many nations involved in the Second World War have been involved in wars since.

==Post-war==

===Chronology of the post–World War II era===

The term "post-war" can have different meanings in different countries and refer to a period determined by local considerations based on the effect of the war there. In Britain, "post-war" refers to the period from the election of [[Clement Attlee]] in 1945 to that of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1979, a period of so-called [[post-war consensus]], while it may also refer to a shorter period, ending in 1960 or shortly after and corresponding to the 1950s era, hence 1945–1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/aec-lorries-post-war-years-1945-1979-248690820 AEC Lorries in the post war years 1945–1979 book (09/10/2011)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~weterb/The%20Post.htm The Post-War Years 1945 – 1960&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://economics.about.com/od/useconomichistory/a/post_war.htm The Post War Economy: 1945–1960&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold War era===
Considering the post-war era as equivalent to the [[Cold War]] era, post-war sometimes includes the 1980s, putting the end at December 1991, with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.letsgo.com/12350-europe-travel-guides-the_netherlands-history-c |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822122321/http://www.letsgo.com/12350-europe-travel-guides-the_netherlands-history-c |archivedate=2011-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://soapbox.websitetoolbox.com/post?id=2019573 Charting Europe's Future in the 'Post Postwar' Era. - Soap Box Discussion Forums and Messageboard - Home of the Patrioteer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990s and the 21st century are rarely considered to be part of the post-war era.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4391">In mathematics, a '''Rothberger space''' is a [[topological space]] that satisfies a certain a basic [[selection principle]]. A Rothberger space is a space in which for every sequence of open covers &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1, \mathcal{U}_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; of the space there are sets &lt;math&gt; U_1 \in \mathcal{U}_1, U_2 \in \mathcal{U}_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; such that the family &lt;math&gt;\{U_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt; covers the space.

== History ==
In 1938, Fritz Rothberger introduced his property known as &lt;math&gt;C''&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothberger|first=Fritz|date=1938-01-01|title=Eine Verschärfung der Eigenschaft C|url=http://pldml.icm.edu.pl/pldml/element/bwmeta1.element.bwnjournal-article-fmv30i1p8bwm?q=bwmeta1.element.bwnjournal-number-fm-1938-30-1;7&amp;qt=CHILDREN-STATELESS|journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae|language=DE|volume=30|issue=1|issn=0016-2736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characterizations ==

=== Combinatorial characterization ===
For subsets of the real line, the Rothberger property can be characterized using continuous functions into the [[Baire space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. A subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is guessable if there is a function &lt;math&gt;g\in A&lt;/math&gt; such that the sets  &lt;math&gt; \{n:f(n)=g(n)\}&lt;/math&gt; are infinite for all functions &lt;math&gt; f\in A&lt;/math&gt;. A subset of the real line is Rothberger iff every continuous image of that space into the Baire space is guessable. In particular, every subset of the real line of cardinality less than [[Cichoń's diagram|&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{cov}(\mathcal{M})&lt;/math&gt;]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Nkzbkj-c83YC|title=Set Theory: On the Structure of the Real Line|last=Bartoszynski|first=Tomek|last2=Judah|first2=Haim|date=1995-08-15|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|isbn=9781568810447|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is Rothberger.

=== Topological game characterization ===
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space. The Rothberger game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_1(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; played on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a game with two players Alice and Bob.

'''1st round''': Alice chooses an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Bob chooses a set &lt;math&gt;U_1\in \mathcal{U}_1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''2nd round''': Alice chooses an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_2&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Bob chooses a finite set &lt;math&gt;U_2\in\mathcal{U}_2&lt;/math&gt;.

'''etc.'''

If the family &lt;math&gt;\{U_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt; is a cover of the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then Bob wins the game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_1(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;. Otherwise, Alice wins.

A player has a winning strategy if he knows how to play in order to win the game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_1(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; (formally, a winning strategy is a function).
* A topological space is Rothberger iff Alice has no winning strategy in the game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_1(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; played on this space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pawlikowski|first=Janusz|title=Undetermined sets of point-open games|url=https://eudml.org/doc/212029|journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae|volume=144|issue=3|issn=0016-2736}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a metric space. Bob has a winning strategy in the game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_1(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; played on the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; iff the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is countable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheepers|first=Marion|date=1995-01-01|title=A direct proof of a theorem of Telgársky|url=http://www.ams.org/proc/1995-123-11/S0002-9939-1995-1273523-1/|journal=Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society|volume=123|issue=11|pages=3483–3485|doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-1995-1273523-1|issn=0002-9939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Telgársky|first=Rastislav|date=1984-06-01|title=On games of Topsoe|url=http://www.mscand.dk/article/view/12050|journal=Mathematica Scandinavica|volume=54|pages=170–176|doi=10.7146/math.scand.a-12050|issn=1903-1807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4841">'''Sat''' ({{lang-sa|[[wikt:सत्#Noun_2|सत्]]}}) is a [[Sanskrit]] word meaning "the true essence and that "which is unchangeable" of an entity, species or existence.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Monier Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120831056}}, pages 1134-1139&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sat'' is a common prefix in ancient Indian literature and variously implies that which is good, true, virtuous, being, happening, real, existing, enduring, lasting, essential.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Monier Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120831056}}, pages 1134-1139&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient texts, fusion words based on ''Sat'', refer to "Universal Spirit, Universal Principle, Being, Soul of the World, [[Brahman]]".&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, H. (1954), The Concept of Brahman in Hindu Philosophy, Philosophy East and West, 4(1), 47-66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aandb&gt;Aurobindo &amp; Basu (2002), The Sadhana of Plotinus, Neoplatonism and Indian Philosophy, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791452745}}, pages 153-156&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
It can simply be said to be the [[present participle]] of the root ''as'' "to be" ([[PIE]] ''{{PIE|[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European *h₁es-|*h₁es-]]}}''; cognate to English ''[[:wikt:is|is]]'').

The concept is famously expressed in a [[Pavamana Mantra|mantra]] found in the [[Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad|{{IAST|Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad}}]] (1.3.28),
:{{IAST|Asato mā sad gamaya / tamaso mā jyotir gamaya / mṛtyor mā amṛtam gamaya}}
:"lead me from delusion to truth; from darkness to light; from mortality to immortality"

''Sat'' is the root of many Sanskrit words and concepts such as ''[[sattva]]'' "pure, truthful" and ''[[satya]]'' "truth". As a prefix, in some context it means true and genuine; for example, sat-sastra means true doctrine, sat-van means one devoted to the true.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Anthony Macdonell]], A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820005}}, pages 329-331&lt;/ref&gt; At a suffix, in some context it implies time; for example, panka-sat which means fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Anthony Macdonell, A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820005}}, pages 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir Monier Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120831056}}, pages 1134-1139&lt;/ref&gt;

The negation of ''sat'' is '''asat''', a combination word of ''a'' and ''sat''. ''Asat'' refers to the opposite of ''sat'', that is delusion, distorted, untrue, fleeting impression that is incorrect, invalid and false.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Anthony Macdonell, A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820005}}, pages 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smmw&gt;Sir Monier Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120831056}}, pages 1134-1139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
{{See also|Theory of Forms|Archetype}}
Sat has several meanings or translations:&lt;ref name=smmw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Ishwaran, Ascetic Culture: Renunciation and Worldly Engagement, Brill, {{ISBN|978-9004114128}}, pages 143-144&lt;/ref&gt;
* "unchangeable"
* "that which has no distortion"
* "that which is beyond distinctions of time, space, and person"
* "that which pervades the [[universe]] in all its constancy"
* "[[absolute truth]]"
* "[[reality]]"
* "Supreme Entity"
* "[[Brahman]]" (not to be confused with Brahmin)

===Supreme consciousness===
:''See also [[Brahman]], [[Turiya]] and [[Neoplatonism#The One|The One]]''&lt;ref&gt;Similar ideas can be found in [[Neoplatonism]], which originated in ancient Greece, and shares common grounds with Indian religions via the [[Proto-Indo-European religion]]. "Hè idea tou agathou" means 'Reality in her most true appearance'. The One and The Good are identical to The Good.  See [http://www.rkk.nl/abc/detail_objectID593739.html RKK, ''Plato: leer'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Sat may also refer to Citsvaru'pa, the Supreme consciousness, or [[Vihangamyoga#The Supreme, Being (Parama Purusha)|Parama Purusha]], the Supreme Being.{{cn|date=December 2014}} "Sat" is one of the three characteristics of [[Brahman]], as described in [[Satcitananda|sat-chit-ananda]].&lt;ref name=aandb/&gt;

A '''sex worker''' is a person who is employed in the [[sex industry]].&lt;ref name=oed1&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, "sex worker"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, "sex industry".&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used in reference to all those in all areas of the sex industry including those who provide direct sexual services as well as the staff and management of such industries.{{sfn|Weitzer|2009}} Some sex workers are paid to engage in sex acts or sexually explicit behavior which involve varying degrees of physical contact with clients ([[prostitution|prostitutes]] and some but not all professional dominants); [[pornography]] [[Erotic nude model|models]] and [[Pornographic film actor|actors]] engage in sexually explicit behavior which are filmed or photographed. [[Phone sex]] operators have sexually-oriented conversations with clients, and do auditive [[sexual roleplay]].

Other sex workers are paid to engage in live sexual performance, such as [[Webcam model|webcam sex]]&lt;ref&gt;Weitzer, Ronald. 2000. ''Sex For Sale: Prostitution, Pornography, and the Sex Industry'' (New York: Routledge Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Benjamin R. (June 2018). "Patterns of interaction in webcam sex work: a comparative analysis of female and male." ''Deviant Behavior'' 39(6): 732-746. https://doi.org/10.1080/01639625.2017.1304803&lt;/ref&gt; and performers in live [[sex show]]s. Some sex workers perform [[erotic dance]]s and other acts for an audience. These include: [[striptease]], [[Go-Go dancing|go-go dancing]], [[lap dancing]], [[neo-burlesque]], and [[peep show]]s. [[Sexual surrogate]]s work with psychoanalysts to engage in sexual activity as part of therapy with their clients.&lt;ref&gt;Poelzl, Linda. (October 2011). "Bisexual issues in sex therapy: a bisexual surrogate partner relates her experiences from the field." ''Journal of Bisexuality'' 11(4): 385-388. DOI:10.1080/15299716.2011.620454&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although the term ''sex worker'' is sometimes viewed as a [[synonym]] or [[euphemism]] for "prostitute", it is more general. ''Sex worker'' can refer to individuals who do not directly engage in sexual activity such as pole dancers, sex toy testers, and strip club managers.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Green, Alison. “Top 10 Sex-Related Jobs.” CareerAddict, 30 Oct. 2017, www.careeraddict.com/top-10-sex-related-jobs&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Weitzer|2009}} Another example of sex workers that would not fall under the term ''prostitute'' would be an adult talent manager, who negotiates and secures pornographic roles for clients. There are also erotic photographers who shoot and edit for adult media and porn reviewers who watch and rate adult films.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Some people use the term ''sex worker'' to avoid invoking the [[Social stigma|stigma]] associated with the word ''prostitute''. Using the term ''sex worker'' rather than ''prostitute'' also allows more members of the sex industry to be represented and helps ensure that individuals who are actually prostitutes are not singled out and associated with the negative connotations of ''prostitute.'' In addition, choosing to use the term ''sex worker'' rather than ''prostitute'' shows ownership over the individuals' career choice. Some argue that those who prefer the term ''sex worker'' wish to separate their occupation from their person. Describing someone as a sex worker recognizes that the individual may have many different facets, and are not necessarily defined by their job.

Sex work is different from [[sexual exploitation]], or the forcing of a person to commit sexual acts, in that sex work is voluntary "and is seen as the commercial exchange of sex for money or goods".&lt;ref name=Burnes&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burnes|first1=Theodore R.|title=Sex Work|date=2017|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks|url=http://electra.lmu.edu:2152/reference/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-psychology-and-gender/i14891.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to further clarify the broad term that ''sex work'' is, John E. Exner, an American psychologist, worked with his colleagues to create five distinct classes for categorizing sex workers. One scholarly article details the classes as follows: "specifically, the authors articulated Class I, or the upper class of the profession, consisting of call girls; Class II was referred to as the middle class, consisting of 'in-house girls' who typically work in an establishment on a commission basis; Class III, the lower middle class, were 'streetwalkers' whose fees and place of work fluctuate considerably; Class IV sex workers have been known as 'commuter housewives', and they are typically involved in sex work to supplement family income; and Class V consists of 'streetwalker addicts', or 'drugs-for-sex streetwalkers' who are considered the lower class of the profession."&lt;ref name=Burnes/&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term ''sex worker'' was coined in 1978 by sex worker activist [[Carol Leigh]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Its use became popularized after publication of the anthology, ''Sex Work: Writings By Women In The Sex Industry'' in 1987, edited by Frédérique Delacoste and Priscilla Alexander.&lt;ref name="sex-work"&gt;''Sex work: writings by women in the sex industry'' edited by Frédérique Delacoste &amp;  Priscilla Alexander, Cleis Press, 1991 (2nd ed). {{ISBN|0-939416-11-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bayswan.org/sexwork-oed.html "The Etymology of the terms 'Sex Work' and 'Sex Worker'"], ''BAYSWAN.org''. Accessed 2009-09-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whores-and-other"&gt;''Whores and other feminists'', edited by Jill Nagle, Routledge, 1997. {{ISBN|0-415-91822-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "sex worker" has since spread into much wider use, including in academic publications, by [[NGO]]s and labor unions, and by governmental and intergovernmental agencies, such as the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/gender/documents/sexworkers.pdf "Violence Against Sex Workers and HIV Prevention" report] published by the World Health Organization&lt;/ref&gt; The term is listed in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;ref name=oed1/&gt; and [[Merriam-Webster]]'s Dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary, "[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sex%20worker sex worker]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is strongly opposed, however, by many who are morally opposed to the sex industry, such as [[social conservatives]], [[anti-prostitution feminists]], and other prohibitionists.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Such groups view prostitution variously as a crime or as victimization, and see the term "[[sex work]]" as legitimizing criminal activity or exploitation as a type of labor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/pdfs/FarleyYaleLaw2006.pdf "Prostitution, trafficking, and cultural amnesia: What we must not know in order to keep the business of sexual exploitation running smoothly"] by Melissa Farley, ''Yale Journal of Law and Feminism'' 18(1):109–144, Spring 2006. "Some words hide the truth. Just as torture can be named enhanced interrogation, and logging of old-growth forests is named the Healthy Forest Initiative, words that lie about prostitution leave people confused about the nature of prostitution and trafficking. The words ‘sex work’ make the harms of prostitution invisible."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Baptie| first = Trisha|authorlink=Trisha Baptie| title = 'Sex worker' ?

Sex workers may be any gender and exchange sexual services or favors for money or other gifts. The motives of sex workers vary widely and can include debt, coercion, survival, or simply as a way to earn a living.&lt;ref name="The many faces of sex work"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harcourt|first=C|author2=B Donovan |title=The many faces of sex work|journal=Sexually Transmitted Infections|date=2005|volume=81|pages=201–206|url=http://sti.bmj.com/content/81/3/201.full.pdf+html|accessdate=24 April 2014|issue=3|doi=10.1136/sti.2004.012468|pmid=15923285|pmc=1744977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual empowerment is another possible reasons why people engage in sex work. One Canadian study found that a quarter of the sex workers interviewed started sex work because they found it "appealing".&lt;ref name=Givetash&gt;{{cite newspaper|last=Givetash|first=Linda|title=Some Sex Workers Choose Industry Due to Benefits of Occupation: Study|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|publisher=Phillip Crawley|date=14 April 2017|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/some-sex-workers-choose-industry-due-to-benefits-of-occupation-study/article33965010/|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flexibility to choose hours of work and ability to select their own client base may also contribute the appeal of sex work when compared to other service industry jobs.&lt;ref name=Givetash/&gt; Sex work may also be a way to fund addiction.&lt;ref name=Breslin&gt;{{cite newspaper|last=Breslin|first=Susannah|title=Why Do Women Become Sex Workers, and Why Do Men Go to Them?|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 August 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/aug/05/payoff-sex-workers-clients-stories|location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; This line of work can be fueled by an individual's addiction to illegal substances before entering the industry or being introduced to these substances after entering the industry.&lt;ref name=Breslin/&gt; These motives also align with varying climates surrounding sex work in different communities and cultures. In some cases, sex work is linked to tourism. Sex work can take the form of [[prostitution]], [[Stripper|stripping]] or [[Lap dance|lap dancing]], performance in [[pornography]], phone or internet sex, or any other exchange of sexual services for financial or material gain. The variety in the tasks encompassed by sex work lead to a large range in both severity and nature of risks that sex workers face in their occupations. Sex workers can act independently as individuals, work for a company or corporation, or work as part of a brothel. All of the above can be undertaken either by free choice or by coercion. Sex workers may also be hired to be companions on a trip or to perform sexual services within the context of a trip; either of these can be voluntary or forced labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ryan | first1 = Chris | last2 = Kinder | first2 = Rachel | year = 1996 | title = Sex, tourism and sex tourism: fulfilling similar needs?. | url = | journal = Tourism Management | volume = 17 | issue = 7| pages = 507–518 | doi=10.1016/s0261-5177(96)00068-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transgender sex worker|Transgender people]] are more likely than the general population to do sex work, particularly [[trans women]] and trans people of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://endtransdiscrimination.org/PDFs/NTDS_Report.pdf|title=Injustice at Every Turn: A Report of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of female Indian sex workers, illiteracy and lower social status were more prevalent than among the general female population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Demography and sex work characteristics of female sex workers in India|journal=BMC International Health and Human Rights|volume=6|pages=5|date=April 2006|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-698X/6/5|doi=10.1186/1472-698X-6-5|pmid=16615869|pmc=1468426|last1=Dandona|first1=Rakhi|last2=Dandona|first2=Lalit|last3=Kumar|first3=G Anil|last4=Gutierrez|first4=Juan Pablo|last5=McPherson|first5=Sam|last6=Samuels|first6=Fiona|last7=Bertozzi|first7=Stefano M.|author8=ASCI FPP Study Team}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies struggle to gain demographic information about the prevalence of sex work, as many countries or cities have laws prohibiting prostitution or other sex work. In addition, [[sex trafficking]], or forced sex work, is also difficult to quantify due to its underground and covert nature. In addition, finding a representative sample of sex workers in a given city can be nearly impossible because the size of the population itself is unknown. Maintaining privacy and confidentiality in research is also difficult because many sex workers may face prosecution and other consequences if their identities are revealed.&lt;ref name="Shaver - Sex Work Research"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaver|first=Frances M.|title=Sex work research: methodological and ethical challenges|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|date=March 2005|volume=20|issue=3|pages=296–319|doi=10.1177/0886260504274340|pmid=15684139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While demographic characteristics of sex workers vary by region and are hard to measure, some studies have attempted to estimate the composition of the sex work communities in various places. For example, one study of sex work in Tijuana, Mexico found that the majority of sex workers there are young, female and heterosexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katsulis|first=Yasmina|title=Sex Work and the City|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LG0ddgALFAsC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=sex+work+trans#v=onepage&amp;q=sex%20work%20trans&amp;f=false|isbn=9780292779808|date=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these studies attempt to use smaller samples of sex workers and [[pimps]] in order to extrapolate about larger populations of sex workers. One report on the underground sex trade in the United States used known data on the illegal drug and weapon trades and interviews with sex workers and pimps in order to draw conclusions about the number of sex workers in eight American cities.&lt;ref name="Urban Institute - Underground Sex Economy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dank|first=Meredith|title=Estimating the Size and Structure of the Underground Commercial Sex Economy in Eight Major US Cities|url=http://www.urban.org/publications/413047.html|publisher=Urban Institute|display-authors=etal|date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies like this one can come under scrutiny for a perceived emphasis on the activities and perspectives of pimps rather than those of sex workers themselves. Another criticism is that sex trafficking may not be adequately assessed in its relation to sex work in these studies.&lt;ref name="Misconceptions - UCSE report"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dank|first=Meredith|title=Misconceptions about our report on the underground commercial sex economy|url=http://blog.metrotrends.org/2014/03/misconceptions-ucse/|publisher=Urban Institute|accessdate=31 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140331221527/http://blog.metrotrends.org/2014/03/misconceptions-ucse/|archivedate=31 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on local law, sex workers' activities may be regulated, controlled, tolerated, or prohibited. In most countries, even those where sex work is legal, sex workers may be stigmatized and marginalized, which may prevent them from seeking legal redress for discrimination (e.g., [[racial discrimination]] by a [[strip club]] owner), non-payment by a [[customer|client]], [[assault]] or [[rape]]. Sex worker advocates have identified this as [[whorephobia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plusnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=62615 Ethiopia: Poverty forcing girls into risky sex work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703092438/http://www.plusnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=62615 |date=2009-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportID=83273|title=IRIN Africa - KENYA: Desperate times: women sell sex to buy food  - Kenya - HIV/AIDS (PlusNews)|work=IRINnews|date=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legality of different types of sex work varies within and between regions of the world. For example, while pornography is legal in the United States, prostitution is illegal in most parts of the US. However, in other regions of the world, both pornography and prostitution are illegal; in others, both are legal. One example of a country in which pornography, prostitution, and all professions encompassed under the umbrella of sex work are all legal is New Zealand. Under the Prostitution Reform Act of New Zealand, laws and regulations have been put into place in order to ensure the safety and protection of its sex workers. For example, since the implementation of the Prostitution Reform Act, "any person seeking to open a larger brothel, where more than four sex workers will be working requires a Brothel Operators Certificate, which certifies them as a suitable person to exercise control over sex workers in the workplace. [In addition,] sex workers operating in managed premises have access to labour rights and human rights protection and can pursue claims before the courts, like any other worker or employee."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cunningham|first1=Stewart|title=Reinforcing or Challenging Stigma?

There are many arguments against legalizing prostitution/sex work. In one study, women involved in sex work were interviewed and asked if they thought it should be made legal. They answered that they thought it should not, as it would put women at higher risk from violent customers if it were considered legitimate work, and they would not want their friends or family entering the sex industry to earn money. Another argument is that legalizing sex work would increase the demand for it, and women should not be treated as sexual merchandise. A study showed that in countries that have legalized prostitution, there was an increase in child prostitution. An argument against legalizing sex work is to keep children from being involved in this industry. The studies also showed that legalizing sex work lead to an increase in sex trafficking, which is another reason people give for making sex work illegal.&lt;ref name="Janice G. Raymond - Ten Reasons for Not Legalizing Prostitution and a Legal Response to the Demand for Prostitution"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raymond|first=Leigh|title=Ten Reasons for Not Legalizing Prostitution and a Legal Response to the Demand for Prostitution|journal=Journal of Trauma Practice|date=October 15, 2008|doi=10.1300/J189v02n03_17|volume=2|issue=3–4|pages=315–332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also arguments for legalizing prostitution/sex work. One major argument for legalizing prostitution is that women should have a right to do what they want with their own bodies. The government should not have a say in what they do for work, and if they want to sell their bodies it is their own decision. Another common argument for legalizing prostitution is that enforcing prostitution laws is a waste of money. This is because prostitution has always, and will continue to persist despite whatever laws and regulations are implemented against it. In arguing for the decriminalization of sex work, the Minister of Justice of the Netherlands expanded upon this argument in court when stating that, "prostitution has existed for a long time and will continue to do so…Prohibition is not the way to proceed…One should allow for voluntary prostitution. The authorities can then regulate prostitution, [and] it can become healthy, safe, transparent, and cleansed from criminal side-effects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weitzer|first1=Ronald John|title=Legalizing Prostitution: From Illicit Vice to Lawful Business|year=2012|publisher=NYU Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ercUCgAAQBAJ|isbn=9780814794630}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who wish to legalize prostitution do not see enforcing laws against sex work as effective and think the money is better spent elsewhere. Many people also argue that legalization of prostitution will lead to less harm for the sex workers. They argue that the decriminalization of sex work will decrease the exploitation of sex workers by third parties such as pimps and managers. A final argument for the legalization of sex work is that prostitution laws are unconstitutional. Some argue that these laws go against people's rights to free speech, privacy, etc.&lt;ref name="Ronald Weitzer - Prostitutes' Rights in the United States: The Failure of a Movement"&gt;{{cite news|last=Weitzer|first=Ronald|title=Prostitutes' Rights in the United States: The Failure of a Movement|jstor=4121439|journal=The Sociological Quarterly|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk reduction ==
Risk reduction in sex work is a highly debated topic. "Abolitionism" and "nonabolitionism" or "empowerment" are regarded as opposing ways in which risk reduction is approached.&lt;ref name="Traffic Violations"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saunders|first=Penelope|title=Traffic Violations: Determining the Meaning of Violence in Sexual Trafficking versus Sex Work|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|date=March 2005|volume=20|issue=3|pages=343–360|url=http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/Determining%20the%20meaning%20of%20violence%20in%20sexual%20trafficking%20versus%20sex%20work%20Saunders%20J%20Interpers%20Viol%202005%2020(3)%20343-360.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120915113821/http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/Determining%20the%20meaning%20of%20violence%20in%20sexual%20trafficking%20versus%20sex%20work%20Saunders%20J%20Interpers%20Viol%202005%2020(3)%20343-360.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-09-15|accessdate=24 April 2014|doi=10.1177/0886260504272509|pmid=15684141|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While abolitionism would call for an end to all sex work, empowerment would encourage the formation of networks among sex workers and enable them to prevent STIs and other health risks by communicating with each other.&lt;ref name="Reframing Sex Worker Health"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Joseph|author2=Astrid Tuminez|title=Reframing the Interpretation of Sex Worker Health: A Behavioral–Structural Approach|journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=204|issue=5|pages=S1206–10|doi=10.1093/infdis/jir534|pmid=22043033|url=http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/204/suppl_5/S1206.short|accessdate=14 March 2014|pmc=3205084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both approaches aim to reduce rates of disease and other negative effects of sex work.

In addition, sex workers themselves have disputed the dichotomous nature of abolitionism and nonabolitionism, advocating instead a focus on sex workers' rights. In 1999, the Network of Sex Worker Projects claimed that "Historically, anti-trafficking measures have been more concerned with protecting 'innocent' women from becoming prostitutes than with ensuring the human rights of those in the sex industry.&lt;ref name="Traffic Violations" /&gt; Penelope Saunders, a sex workers' rights advocate, claims that the sex workers' rights approach considers more of the historical context of sex work than either abolitionism or empowerment. In addition, Jo Doezema has written that the dichotomy of the voluntary and forced approaches to sex work has served to deny sex workers agency.&lt;ref name="Global Sex Workers Kempadoo"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kempadoo|first=Kamala|title=Global Sex Workers: Rights, Resistance, and Redefinition|date=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health ===
Sex workers are unlikely to disclose their work to healthcare providers. This can be due to embarrassment, fear of disapproval, or a disbelief that sex work can have effects on their health.&lt;ref name="Sex Worker Health: San Francisco"/&gt; The criminalization of sex work in many places can also lead to a reluctance to disclose for fear of being turned in for illegal activities. There are very few legal protections for sex workers due to criminalization; thus, in many cases, a sex worker reporting violence to a healthcare provider may not be able to take legal action against their aggressor.&lt;ref name="Violence + Condom Negotiation" /&gt;

Health risks of sex work relate primarily to sexually transmitted infections and to drug use. In one study, nearly 40% of sex workers who visited a health center reported illegal drug use.&lt;ref name="Sex Worker Health: San Francisco"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohan|first=D|title=Sex Worker Health: San Francisco Style|journal=Sexually Transmitted Infections|date=Oct 2006|volume=82|issue=5|pages=418–422|doi=10.1136/sti.2006.020628|pmid=16854996|pmc=2563853}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, transgender women sex workers have a higher risk of contracting HIV than male and female sex workers and transgender women who are not sex workers.&lt;ref name="Sex Work HIV Transgender Women"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Operario|first=Don|title=Sex Work and HIV Status Among Transgender Women: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome|date=May 1, 2008|volume=48|issue=1|pages=97–103|url=http://www.igh.org/Cochrane/Operario_etal.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2014|doi=10.1097/qai.0b013e31816e3971|pmid=18344875|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428143743/http://www.igh.org/Cochrane/Operario_etal.pdf|archivedate=28 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason transgender women are at higher risk for developing HIV is their combination of risk factors. They face biological, personal, relational, and structural risks that all increase their chances of getting HIV. Biological factors include incorrect condom usage because of erectile disfunction from hormones taken to become more feminine and receptive anal intercourse without a condom which is a high risk for developing HIV. Personal factors include mental health issues that lead to increased sexual risk, such as anxiety, depression, and substance abuse provoked through lack of support, violence, etc. Structural risks include involvement in sex work being linked to poverty, substance abuse, and other factors that are more prevalent in transgender women based on their tendency to be socially marginalized and not accepted for challenging gender norms. The largest risk for HIV is unprotected sex with male partners, and studies have been emerging that show men who have sex with transgender women are more likely to use drugs than men that do not.&lt;ref name="Tonia Potiat - HIV risk and preventive interventions in transgender women sex workers"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Potiat|first=Tonia|title=HIV risk and preventive interventions in transgender women sex workers|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673614608333|accessdate=11 November 2017|journal=The SLancet|date=January 23, 2015|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60833-3|pmid=25059941|volume=385|issue=9964|pages=274–286|pmc=4320978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Condom use is one way to mitigate the risk of contracting an STI. However, negotiating condom use with one's clients and partners is often an obstacle to practicing safer sex. While there is not much data on rates of violence against sex workers, many sex workers do not use condoms due to the fear of resistance and violence from clients. Some countries also have laws prohibiting condom possession; this reduces the likelihood that sex workers will use condoms.&lt;ref name="Violence + Condom Negotiation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shannon|first=Kate|author2=Joanne Csete|title=Violence, Condom Negotiation, and HIV/STI Risk Among Sex Workers|journal=JAMA|date=August 4, 2010|volume=304|issue=5|pages=573–574|doi=10.1001/jama.2010.1090|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=186320|accessdate=14 March 2014|pmid=20682941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased organization and networking among sex workers has been shown to increase condom use by increasing access to and education about STI prevention. Brothels with strong workplace health practices, including the availability of condoms, have also increased condom use among their workers.&lt;ref name="Violence + Condom Negotiation" /&gt;

'''''Health Concerns of Exotic Dancers'''''&lt;br&gt;''Mental Health and Stigma''&lt;br&gt;In order to protect themselves from the stigma of sex work, many dancers resort to othering themselves. Othering involves constructing oneself as superior to one's peers, and the dancer persona provides an internal boundary that separates the "authentic" from the stripper self. This practice creates a lot of stress for the dancers, in turn leading many to resort to using drugs and alcohol to cope. Since it is so widespread, the use of drugs has become normalized in the exotic dance scene.&lt;br&gt;Despite this normalization, passing as nonusers, or covering as users of less maligned drugs, is necessary. This is because strippers concurrently attribute a strong moral constitution to those that resist the drug atmosphere; it is a testament to personal strength and will power. It is also an occasion for dancers to "other" fellow strippers. Valorizing resistance to the drug space discursively positions "good" strippers against such a drug locale and indicates why dancers are motivated to closet hard drug use.&lt;br&gt;Stigma causes strippers to hide their lifestyles from friends and family alienating themselves from a support system. Further, the stress of trying to hide their lifestyles from others due to fear of scrutiny affects the mental health of dancers. Stigma is a difficult area to address because it is more abstract, but it would be helpful to work toward normalizing sex work as a valid way of making a living. This normalization of sex work would relieve the stress many dancers experience increasing the likelihood that they will be open about their work. Being open will allow them access to a viable support system and reduce the othering and drug use so rampant in the sex industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tyndale | first1 = Maticka | year = 2000 | title = Exotic dancing and health | url = | journal = Women &amp; Health | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 87–108 | doi=10.1300/j013v31n01_06| pmid = 11005222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barton | first1 = B | year = 2007 | title = Managing the toll of stripping boundary setting among exotic dancers | url = | journal = Journal of Contemporary Ethnography | volume = 36 | issue = 5| page = 571 | doi=10.1177/0891241607301971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forced sex work ===
{{see also|Sexual slavery|Sex trafficking}}
Forced sex work is when an individual enters into any sex trade due to coercion rather than by choice. Forced sex work increases the likelihood that a sex worker will contract HIV/AIDS or another sexually transmitted infection, particularly when an individual enters sex work before the age of 18.&lt;ref name="Associations of Sex Trafficking with Sexual Risk"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silverman|first=JG|title=Associations of Sex Trafficking History with Recent Sexual Risk among HIV-Infected FSWs in India.|journal=AIDS and Behavior|date=18 March 2014|volume=18|issue=3|pages=55–61|doi=10.1007/s10461-013-0564-3|pmid=23955657|pmc=4111225}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, even when sex workers do consent to certain sex acts, they are often forced or coerced into others (often anal intercourse) by clients. Sex workers may also experience strong resistance to condom use by their clients, which may extend into a lack of consent by the worker to any sexual act performed in the encounter; this risk is magnified when sex workers are trafficked or forced into sex work.&lt;ref name="Violence + Condom Negotiation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Violence Against Women - Baltimore"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Decker|first=Michele|title=Violence against women in sex work and HIV risk implications differ qualitatively by perpetrator|journal=BMC Public Health|date=23 September 2013|volume=13|issue=876|pages=876|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-13-876|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/13/876|accessdate=14 March 2014|pmid=24060235|pmc=3852292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced sex work often involves deception - workers are told that they can make a living and are then not allowed to leave. This deception can cause ill effects on the mental health of many sex workers. In addition, an assessment of studies estimates that between 40% and 70% of sex workers face violence within a year.&lt;ref name="Violence + Condom Negotiation" /&gt; Currently, there is little support for migrant workers in many countries, including those who have been trafficked to a location for sex.&lt;ref name="Mobility Sex Work Entry + HIV risk"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldenberg|first=S.M.|title="Right Here is the Gateway": Mobility, Sex Work Entry and HIV Risk Along the Mexico–US Border|journal=International Migration|date=14 June 2013|doi=10.1111/imig.12104|volume=52|issue=4|pages=26–40|pmc=4207057|pmid=25346548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy ==
{{main|Sex workers' rights}}
[[File:Folsom Street Fair IMG 6560.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A woman activist uses her nude body to demonstrate for sex workers' rights at [[Folsom Street Fair]], California, USA.]]

Sex worker's rights advocates argue that sex workers should have the same basic human and labor rights as other working people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weitzer | first1 = Ronald | authorlink = Ronald Weitzer | year = 1991 | title = Prostitutes' Rights in the United States | url = | journal = Sociological Quarterly | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 23–41 | doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1991.tb00343.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour calls for the legalization of sex work, the elimination of state regulations that are more repressive than those imposed on other workers and businesses, the right to recognition and protection under labour and employment laws, the right to form and join professional associations or unions, and the right to legally cross borders to work. Advocates also want to see changes in legal practices involving sex work, the [[Red Umbrella Project]] has pushed for the decriminalization of condoms and changes to New York's sex workers diversion program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.vice.com/article/not-everyone-is-happy-with-the-ny-courts-treating-sex-workers-as-trafficking-victims|title=Not Everyone Is Happy with the NY Courts Treating Sex Workers as Trafficking Victims {{!}} VICE News|newspaper=VICE News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocacy for the interests of sex workers can come from a variety of sources, including non-governmental organizations, labor rights organizations, governments, or sex workers themselves. Each year in London [[Sexual Freedom Awards|The Sexual Freedom Awards]] is held to honor the most notable advocates and pioneers of sexual freedom and sex workers' rights in the UK, where sex work is essentially legal.

=== Unionization of sex work ===
The unionization of sex workers is a recent development. The first organization within the contemporary sex workers' rights movement was Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics ([[COYOTE]]), founded in 1973 in San Francisco, California. Many organizations in Western countries were established in the decade after the founding of COYOTE.&lt;ref name="sex worker unionisation Gall" /&gt;  Currently, a small number of sex worker unions exist worldwide. One of the largest is the International Union of Sex Workers, headquartered in the United Kingdom. The IUSW advocates for the rights of all sex workers, whether they chose freely or were coerced to enter the trade, and promotes policies that benefit the interests of sex workers both in the UK and abroad.&lt;ref name="IUSW: Who We Are"&gt;{{cite web|title=IUSW: Who We Are|url=http://www.iusw.org/iusw-who-we-are/|publisher=International Union of Sex Workers|accessdate=15 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315075748/http://www.iusw.org/iusw-who-we-are/|archivedate=15 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many regions are home to sex worker unions, including Latin America, Brazil, Canada, Europe, and Africa.&lt;ref name="Sex worker organizations around the world"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Worker Rights Organizations and Projects Around the World|url=http://www.bayswan.org/orgs.html|publisher=Prostitutes' Education Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In unionizing, many sex workers face issues relating to communication and to the legality of sex work. Because sex work is illegal in many places where they wish to organize, it is difficult to communicate with other sex workers in order to organize. There is also concern with the legitimacy of sex work as a career and an activity that merits formal organizing, largely because of the sexism often present in sex work and the devaluation of sex work as not comparable to other paid labor and employment.&lt;ref name="sex worker unionisation Gall"/&gt;

A factor affecting the unionization of sex work is that many sex workers belong to populations that historically have not had a strong representation in labor unions. While this unionization can be viewed as a way of empowering sex workers and granting them agency within their profession, it is also criticized as implicitly lending its approval to sexism and power imbalances already present in sex work. Unionization also implies a submission to or operation within the systems of capitalism, which is of concern to some feminists.&lt;ref name="sex worker unionisation Gall"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gall|first=Gregor|title=Sex worker unionisation: an exploratory  study of emerging collective organisation|journal=Industrial Relations Journal|date=1 January 2007|volume=38|issue=1|pages=70–88|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2338.2007.00436.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unionizing exotic dancers====
''Independent contractor vs Employee''&lt;br&gt;Performers in general are problematic to categorize because they often exercise a high level of control over their work product, one characteristic of an independent contractor. Additionally, their work can be artistic in nature and often done on a freelance basis. Often, the work of performers does not possess the obvious attributes of employees such as regular working hours, places or duties. Consequently, employers misclassify them because they are unsure of their workers' status, or they purposely misclassify them to take advantage of independent contractors' low costs. Exotic dance clubs are one such employer that purposely misclassify their performers as independent contractors.&lt;br&gt;There are additional hurdles in terms of self-esteem and commitment to unionize. On the most basic level, dancers themselves must have the desire to unionize for collective action. For those who wish not to conform to group activity or want to remain independent, a union may seem as controlling as club management since joining a union would obligate them to pay dues and abide by decisions made through majority vote, with or without their personal approval.&lt;br&gt;In the ''Lusty Lady'' case study, this strip club was the first all woman managed club to successfully unionize in 1996. Some of the working conditions they were able to address included "protest[ing] racist hiring practices, customers being allowed to videotape dancers without their consent via one-way mirrors, inconsistent disciplinary policies, lack of health benefits, and an overall dearth of job security".  Unionizing exotic dancers can certainly bring better work conditions and fair pay, but it is difficult to do at times because of their dubious employee categorization. Also, as is the case with many other unions, dancers are often reluctant to join them. This reluctance can be due to many factors, ranging from the cost of joining a union to the dancers believing they do not need union support because they will not be exotic dancers for a long enough period of time to justify joining a union.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, S. (2001). Exotic dancing and unionizing: The challenges of feminist and antiracist organizing at the Lusty Lady Theater.

Hastings Women's LJ, 10, 231&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) ===
NGOs often play a large role in outreach to sex workers, particularly in HIV and STI prevention efforts.&lt;ref name="Dhanda, dharma, and disease"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Neil|first=John|title=Dhandha, dharma and disease: traditional sex work and HIV/AIDS in rural India|journal=Social Science and Medicine|date=August 2004|volume=59|issue=4|pages=851–860|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953603006257|accessdate=24 April 2014|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2003.11.032|pmid=15177840}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, NGO outreach to sex workers for HIV prevention is sometimes less coordinated and organized than similar HIV prevention programs targeted at different groups (such as men who have sex with men).&lt;ref name="HIV, Sex Work in China"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=Joan|title=HIV, Sex Work, and Civil Society in China|journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases|date=2011|volume=204|issue=5|pages=S1218–S1222|url=http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/204/suppl_5/S1218.long|doi=10.1093/infdis/jir538|pmid=22043035}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of organization may be due to the legal status of prostitution and other sex work in the country in question; in China, many sex work and drug abuse NGOs do not formally register with the government and thus run many of their programs on a small scale and discreetly.&lt;ref name="HIV, Sex Work in China"/&gt;

While some NGOs have increased their programming to improve conditions within the context of sex work, these programs are criticized at times due to their failure to dismantle the oppressive structures of prostitution, particularly forced trafficking. Some scholars believe that advocating for rights within the institution of prostitution is not enough; rather, programs that seek to empower sex workers must empower them to leave sex work as well as improve their rights within the context of sex work.&lt;ref name="Prostitution as violence against women"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Raymond | first = Janice G. | author-link = Janice Raymond | title = Prostitution as violence against women: NGO stonewalling in Beijing and elsewhere | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-5395(96)00102-1 | date = January–February 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Strengths and weaknesses''' generally refer to a person's [[character structure|character]].

Often a [[Virtue|strength]] can be a [[Vice|weakness]], and vice versa, a weakness can be a strength. In [[Chinese philosophy]], [[yin yang|yin and yang]] (e.g., dark and light) are described as complementary opposites within a greater whole. 

For example, here are some opportunity and weaknesses by [[personality type]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterursbender.com/quiz/swtable.html Peter Urs Bender's Guide to Strengths and Weaknesses of Personality Types]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brinkman, Rick, and Rick Kirschner (2002).

'''Sue Shelton White''' (May 25, 1887 &amp;ndash; May 6, 1943), called '''Miss Sue''', was a [[feminism|feminist]] leader and lawyer originally from [[Henderson, Tennessee|Henderson]], [[Tennessee]] who served as a national leader of the [[women's suffrage]] movement.
[[File:Sue S. White 158006v.jpg|thumb|Sue Shelton White circa 1920]]

== Background ==
Sue Shelton White was born on May 25, 1887, in Henderson, Tennessee, the second of three children of James Shelton White and Mary Calista (Swain) White. Her father, a lawyer and Methodist minister, died when she was nine. When her mother died four years later, White went to live with an aunt. When she was sixteen she took a teacher training course at Georgia Robertson Christian College (now [[Freed–Hardeman University|Freed Hardman University]]) and the following year (1904-1905) attended West Tennessee Business College.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch00008|title=White, Sue Shelton, 1887-1943.

== Suffragist ==
White eventually became the recording secretary of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association, and the Tennessee state chair of the National Woman's Party.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

White joined the woman suffrage movement in 1912. She was originally active in the moderate Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association (an affiliate of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]]), and was elected [[Secretary (club)|recording secretary]] for that organization in 1913,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jacksonsun.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/08/25/unveiling-suffrage-womens-equality-day/89309856/|title=Unveiling suffrage on Women’s Equality Day|newspaper=The Jackson Sun|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but gradually concluded that [[Alice Paul]] and [[Lucy Burns]]' more radical [[National Woman's Party]], whose speaking tour through Tennessee by [[Maud Younger]] she had helped facilitate, was advocating policies and methods which would be more effective. She joined the NWP in 1918, became chair of the Tennessee chapter, and moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], where she edited the organization's newspaper, ''The Suffragist''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

With other members of the NWP, White drew national attention when on February 19, 1919, they held the latest of their [[Silent Sentinels]] series of demonstrations in front of the [[White House]] and burned a paper effigy of President [[Woodrow Wilson]] (which White herself dropped into the fire) to protest Wilson's lack of energy in pressuring balky Senators of his own party. White, with others, was arrested and jailed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyaxYvSG6gAC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=Sue+Shelton+White&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBt7uc-qLQAhWGWCYKHdRfCVYQ6AEINjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Sue%20Shelton%20White&amp;f=false|title=After the Vote Was Won: The Later Achievements of Fifteen Suffragists|last=Adams|first=Katherine H.|last2=Keene|first2=Michael L.|date=2010-07-01|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786456475|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her release, White and others like her chartered a railroad car they called the "Prison Special," which toured the United States to keep the issue of suffrage before the public.

After Congress passed the 19th Amendment on June 4, 1919, White returned home and helped Tennessee achieve ratification.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== After the 19th Amendment ==
From 1920 to 1926, White served as an administrative secretary running the Washington office of Tennessee [[Kenneth McKellar (politician)|Kenneth McKeller]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1923, White earned a law degree from Washington College of Law.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Three years later, she returned to Jackson, TN as the city’s first female attorney and to work for her own law firm, Anderson and White.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1928, white worked with the Midwestern division of the Democratic National Committee.  At request of [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], White also helped organize a Tennessee Business and Professional Women's League for [[Al Smith|Alfred E. Smith]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

She worked in the 1932 presidential campaign of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], and from 1934 (when she moved to [[Washington, D.C.]]) held a variety of posts in the [[New Deal]], culminating in her role as [[principal counsel]] of the [[Social Security Administration]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

After a long bout with cancer, White died on May 6, 1943, at the Alexandria, Virginia, home she shared with Florence Armstrong, her long-term friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1501|title=Sue Shelton White {{!}} Entries {{!}} Tennessee Encyclopedia|website=tennesseeencyclopedia.net|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suffering''', or '''pain''' in a broad sense,&lt;ref&gt;See '[[#Terminology|Terminology]]'. See also the entry 'Pleasure' in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pleasure/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy], which begins with this paragraph: "Pleasure, in the inclusive usages most important in moral psychology, ethical theory, and the studies of mind, includes all joy and gladness&amp;nbsp;— all our feeling good, or happy. It is often contrasted with similarly inclusive pain or suffering, which is similarly thought of as including all our feeling bad." It should be mentioned that most encyclopedias, like the one mentioned above and Britannica, do not have an article about suffering and describe pain in the physical sense only.&lt;/ref&gt; may be an experience of unpleasantness and aversion associated with the perception of [[harm]] or threat of harm in an individual.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Wayne Hudson in Historicizing Suffering, Chapter 14 of Perspectives on Human Suffering (Jeff Malpas and Norelle Lickiss, editors, Springer, 2012) : "According to the standard account suffering is a universal human experience described as a negative basic feeling or emotion that involves a subjective character of unpleasantness, aversion, harm or threat of harm to body or mind (Spelman 1997; Cassell 1991)."&lt;/ref&gt; Suffering is the basic element that makes up the negative [[valence (psychology)|valence]] of [[affective]] [[phenomena]]. The opposite of suffering is [[pleasure]] or [[happiness]].

Suffering is often categorized as physical&lt;ref&gt;Examples of physical suffering: [[pain]] of various types, excessive heat, excessive cold, [[itching]], [[hunger]], [[thirst]], [[nausea]], [[air hunger]], [[sleep deprivation]] {{cite web |url=http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section%3DGeneral_Resource_Links%26Template%3D%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm%26ContentID%3D3058 |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926205544/http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=General_Resource_Links&amp;Template=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=3058 |archivedate=September 26, 2008 |df= }}{{cite web |url=http://www.palliative.uab.edu/response/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028180547/http://www.palliative.uab.edu/response/ |archivedate=2007-10-28 |df= }}. Other examples are given by L. W. Sumner, on page 103 of [https://books.google.com/books?id=tjua97jPvEYC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=suffering+sumner+happiness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZyDU9Tqs6H&amp;sig=kgb_8YA1EFDjufwDCACs6w99ND8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=w9qbSs-3Ns-G8QaTufDCBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Welfare, Happiness, and Ethics]: "Think for a moment of the many physical symptoms which, when persistent, can make our lives miserable: nausea, hiccups, sneezing, dizziness, disorientation, loss of balance, itching, 'pins and needles', 'restless legs', tics, twitching, fatigue, difficulty in breathing, and so on."&lt;/ref&gt; or mental.&lt;ref&gt;Mental suffering can also be called psychological or emotional (see [[Psychological pain]]). Examples of mental suffering: [[depression (mood)]] / [[hopelessness]], [[grief]], [[sadness]] / [[loneliness]] / [[Broken heart|heartbreak]], [[disgust]], [[irritation]], [[anger]], [[jealousy]], [[envy]], [[tanha|craving or yearning]], [[frustration]], [[anguish]], [[angst]], [[fear]], [[anxiety]] / [[panic]], [[shame]] / [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[regret (emotion)|regret]], [[embarrassment]] / [[humiliation]], [[Psychomotor agitation|restlessness]].&lt;/ref&gt; It may come in all degrees of intensity, from mild to intolerable. Factors of duration and frequency of occurrence usually compound that of intensity. Attitudes toward suffering may vary widely, in the sufferer or other people, according to how much it is regarded as avoidable or unavoidable, useful or useless, deserved or undeserved.

Suffering occurs in the lives of [[Sentience|sentient]] beings in numerous manners, often dramatically. As a result, many fields of human activity are concerned with some aspects of suffering. These aspects may include the nature of suffering, its processes, its origin and causes, its meaning and significance, its related personal, social, and cultural behaviors, its remedies, management, and uses.

==Terminology==
The word ''suffering'' is sometimes used in the narrow sense of [[pain|physical pain]], but more often it refers to [[psychological pain|mental pain]], or more often yet it refers to pain in the broad sense, i.e. to any unpleasant [[feeling]], [[emotion]] or [[perception|sensation]]. The word ''pain'' usually refers to physical pain, but it is also a common synonym of ''suffering''. The words ''pain'' and ''suffering'' are often used both together in different ways. For instance, they may be used as interchangeable synonyms. Or they may be used in 'contradistinction' to one another, as in "pain is physical, suffering is mental", or "pain is inevitable, suffering is optional". Or they may be used to define each other, as in "pain is physical suffering", or "suffering is severe physical or mental pain".

Qualifiers, such as ''physical'', ''mental'', ''emotional'', and ''psychological'', are often used to refer to certain types of pain or suffering. In particular, ''mental pain (or suffering)'' may be used in relationship with ''physical pain (or suffering)'' for distinguishing between two wide categories of pain or suffering. A first caveat concerning such a distinction is that it uses ''physical pain'' in a sense that normally includes not only the 'typical sensory experience of physical pain' but also other unpleasant bodily experiences including [[dyspnea|air hunger]], [[hunger]], [[vestibular system|vestibular suffering]], [[nausea]], [[sleep deprivation]], and [[itch]]ing. A second caveat is that the terms ''physical'' or ''mental'' should not be taken too literally: physical pain or suffering, as a matter of fact, happens through conscious minds and involves emotional aspects, while mental pain or suffering happens through physical brains and, being an emotion, involves important physiological aspects.

The word ''unpleasantness'', which some people use as a synonym of ''suffering'' or ''pain'' in the broad sense, may be used to refer to the basic affective dimension of pain (its suffering aspect), usually in contrast with the sensory dimension, as for instance in this sentence: "Pain-unpleasantness is often, though not always, closely linked to both the intensity and unique qualities of the painful sensation."&lt;ref&gt;Donald D. Price, [http://molinterv.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/2/6/392 Central Neural Mechanisms that Interrelate Sensory and Affective Dimensions of Pain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818004239/http://molinterv.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/2/6/392 |date=2009-08-18 }}, ‘’Molecular Interventions’’ 2:392-403 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Other current words that have a definition with some similarity to ''suffering'' include ''distress, unhappiness, misery, affliction, woe, ill, discomfort, displeasure, disagreeableness''.

==Philosophy==
{{Hedonism}}
[[Hedonism]], as an ethical theory, claims that good and bad consist ultimately in [[pleasure]] and pain. Many hedonists, in accordance with [[Epicurus]] and contrarily to popular perception of his doctrine, advocate that we should first seek to avoid suffering and that the greatest pleasure lies in a robust state of profound tranquility ([[ataraxia]]) that is free from the worrisome pursuit or the unwelcome consequences of ephemeral pleasures.

For [[Stoicism]], the greatest good lies in reason and virtue, but the soul best reaches it through a kind of indifference ([[apathy|apatheia]]) to pleasure and pain: as a consequence, this doctrine has become identified with stern self-control in regard to suffering.

{{Utilitarianism}}
[[Jeremy Bentham]] developed hedonistic [[utilitarianism]], a popular doctrine in ethics, politics, and economics. Bentham argued that the right act or policy was that which would cause "the greatest happiness of the greatest number". He suggested a procedure called [[felicific calculus|hedonic or felicific calculus]], for determining how much pleasure and pain would result from any action. [[John Stuart Mill]] improved and promoted the doctrine of hedonistic utilitarianism. [[Karl Popper]], in ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', proposed a [[negative utilitarianism]], which prioritizes the reduction of suffering over the enhancement of happiness when speaking of utility: "I believe that there is, from the ethical point of view, no symmetry between suffering and happiness, or between pain and pleasure. (...) human suffering makes a direct moral appeal for help, while there is no similar call to increase the happiness of a man who is doing well anyway." [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]], for his part, advocates a utilitarianism that aims straightforwardly at the abolition of suffering through the use of biotechnology (see more details below in section [[Suffering#Biology, neurology, psychology|Biology, neurology, psychology]]). Another aspect worthy of mention here is that many utilitarians since Bentham hold that the moral status of a being comes from its ability to feel pleasure and pain: therefore, moral agents should consider not only the interests of human beings but also those of (other) animals. [[Richard D. Ryder|Richard Ryder]] came to the same conclusion in his concepts of 'speciesism' and 'painism'. [[Peter Singer]]'s writings, especially the book [[Animal Liberation (book)|''Animal Liberation'']], represent the leading edge of this kind of utilitarianism for animals as well as for people.

Another doctrine related to the relief of suffering is [[humanitarianism]] (see also [[humanitarian principles]], [[humanitarian aid]], and [[humane society]]). "Where humanitarian efforts seek a positive addition to the happiness of sentient beings, it is to make the unhappy happy rather than the happy happier. (...) [Humanitarianism] is an ingredient in many social attitudes; in the modern world it has so penetrated into diverse movements (...) that it can hardly be said to exist in itself."&lt;ref&gt;Crane Brinton, article ''Humanitarianism'', Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pessimism|Pessimists]] hold this world to be mainly bad, or even the worst possible, plagued with, among other things, unbearable and unstoppable suffering. Some identify suffering as the nature of the world, and conclude that it would be better if life did not exist at all. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] recommends us to take refuge in things like art, philosophy, loss of the [[will to live]], and tolerance toward 'fellow-sufferers'.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]],  first influenced by Schopenhauer, developed afterward quite another attitude, arguing that the suffering of life is productive, exalting the [[will to power]], despising weak compassion or pity, and recommending us to embrace willfully the '[[Ewige Wiederkunft|eternal return]]' of the greatest sufferings. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

[[Pain (philosophy)|Philosophy of pain]] is a philosophical specialty that focuses on physical [[pain]] and is, through that, relevant to suffering in general.

==Religion==

Suffering plays an important role in a number of religions, regarding matters such as the following: consolation or relief; moral conduct (do no harm, help the afflicted, show [[compassion]]); spiritual advancement through life hardships or through self-imposed trials ([[mortification of the flesh]], [[penance]], [[ascetism]]); ultimate destiny ([[salvation]], [[damnation]], [[hell]]). [[Theodicy]] deals with the [[problem of evil]], which is the difficulty of reconciling the existence of an omnipotent and benevolent god with the existence of evil: a quintessential form of evil, for many people, is extreme suffering, especially in innocent children, or in creatures destined to an eternity of torments (see [[problem of hell]]).

The '[[Four Noble Truths]]' of [[Buddhism]] are about [[dukkha]], a term often translated as suffering. They state the nature of suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation, the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. Buddhism considers liberation from ''dukkha'' and the practice of compassion ([[Karuṇā|karuna]]) as basic for leading a holy life and attaining [[nirvana]].

Hinduism holds that suffering follows naturally from personal negative behaviors in one’s current life or in a past life (see [[karma in Hinduism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kane, P.V. History of the Dharmaśāstras Vol. 4 p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; One must accept suffering as a just consequence and as an opportunity for spiritual progress. Thus the soul or true self, which is eternally free of any suffering, may come to manifest itself in the person, who then achieves liberation ([[moksha]]). Abstinence from causing pain or harm to other beings ([[ahimsa]]) is a central tenet of Hinduism.  Suffering is thought to be an inclusive effect of human experience.  Beyond this, Hindus are looking to achieve enlightenment and end human suffering by answering questions about life.  This will lead to a unity in God as well as find the meaning of their suffering, ultimately achieving bliss.

Christianity also believes that human suffering plays an important role in religion. Suffering is only to be thought of as a positive experience in the case of achieving a higher meaning of life, such as Jesus suffering for the lives of other people as was the case during the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]].  Suffering is the time to find God and value faith while doing so.  This allows Christians to face reality of human experience with suffering and find an understanding in the divine.

Hinduism and Christianity embrace similar aspects in suffering.  Both religions realize the need for God as well as the moral significance for God that suffering provides.  This allows enlightenment to be reached and suffering to be seen in the conditions that faith entails rather than an issue.  These human experiences with suffering in both Hinduism and Christianity help educators to emphasize the need for dialogue and religious education in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baring|first1=Rito|title=Analyzing Empirical Notions of Suffering:  Advancing Youth Dialogue and Education|journal=Religious Education|date=March 1, 2010|volume=105|issue=02|pages=157–172|doi=10.1080/00344081003645145|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.authenticate.library.duq.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=8&amp;sid=ce11b5d1-a752-4828-83cc-4cd82bd06fa5%40sessionmgr110&amp;hid=112|accessdate=30 September 2014}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]], the faithful must endure suffering with hope and faith, not resist or ask why, accept it as Allah's will and submit to it as a test of faith (Allah never asks more than can be endured). One must also work to alleviate suffering of others, as well as one's own. Suffering is also seen as a blessing in Islam for the mankind . Through the gift of suffering  the Veil of Forgetfulness is torn apart and the sufferer remembers God and connects with him. When people suffer God makes them think of him. Several Islamic Prophet Muhammad's traditions state that, suffering expunges the sins of mankind and cleanses their soul for the immense reward in afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Suffering an Islamic point of view:{{cite web |url=https://seekingthedivinecountenance.wordpress.com/2015/03/14/sufferings-are-divine-grace/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001153423/https://seekingthedivinecountenance.wordpress.com/2015/03/14/sufferings-are-divine-grace/ |archivedate=2016-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible's [[Book of Job]] reflects on the nature and meaning of suffering. It is supplemented in the Hebrew bible by the passages found in the Book of Isaiah and the Book of Jeremiah which elaborate the emotional and physical suffering of a conquered nation with its vanquished inhabitants forced into the suffering of exile and captivity in a foreign land.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah, Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New Testament, suffering is portrayed both in the life of Jesus portrayed in the Synoptics, which narrate the suffering of the crucifixion, and in the post-Easter narratives. The suffering associated with punishment is further portrayed in the Apocalypse of John where suffering at the scene of the Last Judgment is depicted as the just recompense for sin and wrongdoing. Pope John Paul II wrote "On the Christian Meaning of Human Suffering".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_11021984_salvifici-doloris_en.html On the Christian Meaning of Human Suffering] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050930062256/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_11021984_salvifici-doloris_en.html |date=September 30, 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; This meaning revolves around the notion of [[redemptive suffering]].

According to the [[Bahá'í Faith]], all suffering is a brief and temporary manifestation of physical life, whose source is the material aspects of physical existence, and often attachment to them, whereas only joy exists in the spiritual worlds. In the words of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], "''All these examples are to show you that the trials which beset our every step, all our sorrow, pain, shame and grief, are born in the world of matter; whereas the spiritual Kingdom never causes sadness. A man living with his thoughts in this Kingdom knows perpetual joy. The ills all flesh is heir to do not pass him by, but they only touch the surface of his life, the depths are calm and serene.''" ([[Paris Talks]], p.&amp;nbsp;110).

==Arts and literature==

Artistic and literary works often engage with suffering, sometimes at great cost to their creators or performers. The [http://litmed.med.nyu.edu/Keyword?action=listann&amp;id=54 Literature, Arts, and Medicine Database] offers a list of such works under the categories art, film, literature, and theater. Be it in the tragic, comic or other genres, art and literature offer means to alleviate (and perhaps also exacerbate) suffering, as argued for instance in Harold Schweizer's ''Suffering and the remedy of art''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schweizer, Harold |title=Suffering and the remedy of art |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, N.Y |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=0-7914-3264-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bruegel, Pieter de Oude - De val van icarus - hi res.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]''&lt;/center&gt; by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]]]]

This Brueghel painting is among those that inspired W. H. Auden's poem [[Musée des Beaux Arts (poem)|Musée des Beaux Arts]] :

''About suffering they were never wrong,'' &lt;br&gt;
''The Old Masters; how well, they understood'' &lt;br&gt;
''Its human position; how it takes place'' &lt;br&gt;
''While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along;''&lt;br&gt;
''(...)''&lt;br&gt;
''In Breughel's Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away'' &lt;br&gt;
''Quite leisurely from the disaster; (...)''
&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Auden, ''Musée des Beaux Arts'' (1938) in ''Collected Poems'' p. 179 (E. Mendelson ed. 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social sciences==

''Social suffering'', according to [[Arthur Kleinman]] and others, describes "collective and individual human suffering associated with life conditions shaped by powerful social forces".&lt;ref&gt;Social suffering. Daedalus. Proc Amer Acad Arts Sciences 1996;125(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Such suffering is an increasing concern in medical anthropology, ethnography, mass media analysis, and Holocaust studies, says Iain Wilkinson,&lt;ref&gt;Iain Wilkinson, ''Suffering&amp;nbsp;– A Sociological Introduction'', Polity Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; who is developing a sociology of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kent.ac.uk/sspssr/staff/academic/wilkinson.html |title=School of Social Policy, Sociology and Social Research|accessdate=July 31, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014817/http://www.kent.ac.uk/sspssr/staff/academic/wilkinson.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential]]'' is a work by the [[Union of International Associations]]. Its main databases are about world problems (56,564 profiles), global strategies and solutions (32,547 profiles), human values (3,257 profiles), and human development (4,817 profiles). It states that "the most fundamental entry common to the core parts is that of pain (or suffering)" and "common to the core parts is the learning dimension of new understanding or insight in response to suffering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=26 |title=Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – commentaries &amp;#124; Union of International Associations (UIA) |publisher=Uia.be |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717235705/http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=26 |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In economics, the following notions relate not only to the matters suggested by their positive appellations, but to the matter of suffering as well: [[Quality of life|Well-being or Quality of life]], [[Welfare economics]], [[Happiness economics]], [[Gross National Happiness]], [[Genuine Progress Indicator]].

In law, "[[Pain and suffering]]" is a legal term that refers to the mental distress or physical pain endured by a plaintiff as a result of injury for which the plaintiff seeks redress. Assessments of pain and suffering are required to be made for attributing legal awards. In the Western world these are typical made by juries in a discretionary fashion and are regarded as subjective, variable, and difficult to predict,  for instance in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/lawreview/v100/n1/87/LR100n1Avraham.pdf |accessdate=February 17, 2013 |title=Putting a Price on Pain-And-Suffering Damages: A Critique of the Current Approaches and a Preliminary Peoposal for Change

==Biology, neurology, psychology==

Suffering and [[pleasure]] are respectively the negative and positive affects, or hedonic tones, or [[valence (psychology)|valences]] that psychologists often identify as basic in our emotional lives.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanna Colombetti, [http://polorovereto.unitn.it/~colombetti/docs/GC_AppraisingValence05.pdf Appraising Valence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925233238/http://polorovereto.unitn.it/~colombetti/docs/GC_AppraisingValence05.pdf |date=September 25, 2007 }}, Journal of Consciousness Studies 12 (8-10), pp. 106–129 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary role of physical and mental suffering, through natural selection, is primordial: it [[warning system|warns]] of threats, motivates [[coping (psychology)|coping]] ([[fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]], [[escapism]]), and [[reinforce]]s negatively certain behaviors (see [[punishment (psychology)|punishment]], [[aversives]]). Despite its initial disrupting nature, suffering contributes to the organization of meaning in an individual's world and psyche. In turn, meaning determines how individuals or societies experience and deal with suffering.

[[Image:MRI Head 5 slices.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Neuroimaging sheds light on the seat of suffering&lt;/center&gt;]]

Many brain structures and physiological processes are involved in suffering. Various hypotheses try to account for the experience of suffering. One of these, the ''pain overlap theory''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webscript.princeton.edu/~psych/psychology/related/socneuconf/pdf/eisenberger-lieberman2.pdf |title=Pain Overlap Theory |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229045200/http://webscript.princeton.edu/%7Epsych/psychology/related/socneuconf/pdf/eisenberger-lieberman2.pdf |archivedate=February 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; takes note, thanks to neuroimaging studies, that the [[cingulate cortex]] fires up when the brain feels suffering from experimentally induced social distress '''or''' physical pain as well. The theory proposes therefore that physical pain and social pain (i.e. two radically differing kinds of suffering) share a common phenomenological and neurological basis.

According to [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]]’s online manifesto [[The Hedonistic Imperative]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/tabconhi.htm The Hedonistic Imperative: Table Of Contents&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6IEC1EPkK?url=http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/tabconhi.htm |date=2013-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suffering is the avoidable result of Darwinian genetic design. Pearce promotes replacing the pain/pleasure axis with a robot-like response to noxious stimuli&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/vanity-fair.html Vanity Fair interview with Pearce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505015831/http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/vanity-fair.html |date=2007-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or with gradients of bliss,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.gradients.com/ Life in the Far North - An information-theoretic perspective on Heaven] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314162929/http://www.gradients.com/ |date=2016-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[genetic engineering]] and other technical scientific advances.

Hedonistic psychology,&lt;ref&gt;Kahneman, D., E. Diener and N. Schwartz (eds.) ''Well-being: The Foundations of Hedonistic Psychology'', Russell Sage Foundation, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; [[affective science]], and [[affective neuroscience]] are some of the emerging scientific fields that could in the coming years focus their attention on the phenomenon of suffering.

==Health care==
Disease and injury may contribute to suffering in humans and animals. For example, suffering may be a feature of mental or physical illness such as [[borderline personality disorder]]&lt;ref name=PM&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fertuck|first1=EA.|last2=Jekal|first2=A.|last3=Song|first3=I.|last4=Wyman|first4=B.|last5=Morris|first5=MC.|last6=Wilson|first6=ST.|last7=Brodsky|first7=BS.|last8=Stanley|first8=B.|title=Enhanced ‘Reading the Mind in the Eyes’ in borderline personality disorder compared to healthy controls|journal=Psychological Medicine|date=December 2009|volume=39|issue=12|pages=1979–1988|doi=10.1017/S003329170900600X|pmc=3427787|pmid=19460187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM-IV&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)|date=1994|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-89-042061-4|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally in [[Cancer|advanced cancer]].&lt;ref name="Wilson et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=KG.|last2=Chochinov|first2=HM.|last3=McPherson|first3=CJ.|last4=LeMay|first4=K.|last5=Allard|first5=P.|last6=Chary|first6=S.|last7=Gagnon|first7=PR.|last8=Macmillan|first8=K.|last9=De Luca|first9=M.|last10=O'Shea|first10=F.|last11=Kuhl|first11=D.|last12=Fainsinger|first12=RL.|title=Suffering With Advanced Cancer|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology|date=May 1, 2007|volume=25|issue=13|pages=1691–1697|doi=10.1200/JCO.2006.08.6801|url=http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/25/13/1691|accessdate=15 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329234159/http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/25/13/1691|archivedate=29 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health care]] addresses this suffering in many ways, in subfields such as [[medicine]], [[clinical psychology]], [[psychotherapy]], [[alternative medicine]], [[hygiene]], [[public health]], and through various [[health care provider]]s.

Health care approaches to suffering, however, remain problematic.  Physician and author Eric Cassell, widely cited on the subject of attending to the suffering person as a primary goal of medicine, has defined suffering as "the state of severe distress associated with events that threaten the intactness of the person".&lt;ref&gt;Eric J Cassell, ''The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cassell writes: "The obligation of physicians to relieve human suffering stretches back to antiquity. Despite this fact, little attention is explicitly given to the problem of suffering in medical education, research or practice." Mirroring the traditional body and mind dichotomy that underlies its teaching and practice, medicine strongly distinguishes [[pain]] from suffering, and most attention goes to the treatment of pain. Nevertheless, physical pain itself still lacks adequate attention from the medical community, according to numerous reports.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance the [http://www.ampainsoc.org/advocacy/legislative.htm National Pain Care Policy Act of 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515223432/http://www.ampainsoc.org/advocacy/legislative.htm |date=May 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, some medical fields like [[palliative care]], [[pain management|pain management (or pain medicine)]], [[oncology]], or [[psychiatry]], do somewhat address suffering 'as such'. In palliative care, for instance, pioneer [[Cicely Saunders]] created the concept of 'total pain' ('total suffering' say now the textbooks),&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.jpsmjournal.com/article/S0885-3924(03)00516-5/fulltext Existential pain&amp;nbsp;— an entity, a provocation, or a challenge?] in Journal of Pain Symptom and Management, Volume 27, Issue 3, Pages 241-250 (March 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; which encompasses the whole set of physical and mental distress, discomfort, symptoms, problems, or needs that a patient may experience hurtfully.

==Relief and prevention in society==
Since suffering is such a universal motivating experience, people, when asked, can relate their activities to its relief and prevention. Farmers, for instance, may claim that they prevent famine, artists may say that they take our minds off our worries, and teachers may hold that they hand down tools for coping with life hazards. In certain aspects of collective life, however, suffering is more readily an explicit concern by itself. Such aspects may include [[public health]], [[human rights]], [[humanitarian aid]], [[disaster relief]], [[philanthropy]], [[economic aid]], [[social services]], [[insurance]], and [[animal welfare]]. To these can be added the aspects of [[security]] and [[safety]], which relate to precautionary measures taken by individuals or families, to interventions by the military, the police, the firefighters, and to notions or fields like [[social security]], [[environmental security]], and [[human security]].

==Uses==
Philosopher Leonard Katz wrote: "But Nature, as we now know, regards ultimately only fitness and not our happiness (...), and does not scruple to use hate, fear, punishment and even war alongside affection in ordering social groups and selecting among them, just as she uses pain as well as pleasure to get us to feed, water and protect our bodies and also in forging our social bonds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Katz, Leonard David |title=Evolutionary origins of morality: cross-disciplinary perspectives |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Devon |year=2000 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=inmTyPPdR5oC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PRA1-PR15,M1 xv] |isbn=0-907845-07-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People make use of suffering for specific social or personal purposes in many areas of human life, as can be seen in the following instances:

*In arts, literature, or entertainment, people may use suffering for creation, for performance, or for enjoyment. Entertainment particularly makes use of suffering in [[blood sport]]s and [[Violence#Violence in the media|violence in the media]], including [[Video game controversy|violent video games]] depiction of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carlsson |first1=Ulla |title=Children and Media Violence |url=http://survivorbb.rapeutation.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=39&amp;start=5 |website=Altruistic World Online Library |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more or less great amount of suffering is involved in [[body art]]. The most common forms of body art include [[tattooing]], [[body piercing]], [[scarification]], [[human branding]]. Another form of body art is a sub-category of [[performance art]], in which for instance the body is mutilated or pushed to its physical limits.
*In business and various organizations, suffering may be used for constraining humans or animals into required behaviors.
*In a criminal context, people may use suffering for coercion, revenge, or pleasure.
*In interpersonal relationships, especially in places like families, schools, or workplaces, suffering is used for various motives, particularly under the form of [[abuse]] and [[punishment]]. In another fashion related to interpersonal relationships, the sick, or victims, or [[malingering|malingerers]], may use suffering more or less voluntarily to get [[Primary gain|primary, secondary, or tertiary gain]].
*In law, suffering is used for [[punishment]] (see [[penal law]] ); victims may refer to what legal texts call "[[pain and suffering]]" to get compensation; lawyers may use a victim's suffering as an argument against the accused; an accused's or defendant's suffering may be an argument in their favor; authorities at times use light or heavy [[torture]] in order to get information or a confession.
*In the news media, suffering is often the raw material.&lt;ref&gt;This observation is common. See for instance Public Acts: Disruptive Readings on Making Curriculum Public, by Jose Francisco Ibáñez-Carrasco, Erica R. Meiners, Suzanne De Castell: "In our era of information saturation, media uses pain, suffering, and desire to distract and to create spectacular roadkill out of poverty, deviancy, and violence (...)" (available at https://books.google.com/books?id=slYkeuZ3KQoC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=%22media+uses+pain%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=F_qccUl4dL&amp;sig=5HoSwY1BNPB_ydldia-Dgx-niOw&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result). See also for instance [[Arthur Kleinman]] about the uses and abuses of images of suffering in the media.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In personal conduct, people may use suffering for themselves, in a positive way.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Viktor Frankl's [[Man's Search for Meaning]]&lt;/ref&gt; Personal suffering may lead, if bitterness, depression, or spitefulness is avoided, to character-building, spiritual growth, or moral achievement;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fukuyama, Francis |title=Our posthuman future: consequences of the biotechnology revolution |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |location=New York |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-374-23643-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; realizing the extent or gravity of suffering in the world may motivate one to relieve it and may give an inspiring direction to one's life. Alternatively, people may make self-detrimental use of suffering. Some may be caught in compulsive reenactment of painful feelings in order to protect them from seeing that those feelings have their origin in unmentionable past experiences; some may addictively indulge in disagreeable emotions like fear, anger, or jealousy, in order to enjoy pleasant feelings of arousal or release that often accompany these emotions; some may engage in acts of [[self-harm]] aimed at relieving otherwise unbearable states of mind.
*In politics, there is purposeful infliction of suffering in [[war]], [[torture]], and [[terrorism]]; people may use nonphysical suffering against competitors in nonviolent power struggles; people who argue for a policy may put forward the need to relieve, prevent or avenge suffering; individuals or groups may use past suffering as a political lever in their favor.
*In religion, suffering is used especially to grow spiritually, to expiate, to inspire compassion and help, to frighten, to punish.
*In [[rites of passage]] (see also [[hazing]], [[ragging]]), rituals that make use of suffering are frequent.
*In science, humans and animals are subjected on purpose to aversive experiences for the study of suffering or other phenomena.
*In sex, especially in a context of [[sadism and masochism]] or [[BDSM]], individuals may use a certain amount of physical or mental suffering (e.g. pain, humiliation).
*In sports, suffering may be used to outperform competitors or oneself; see [[sports injury]], and [[no pain, no gain]]; see also [[blood sport]] and [[violence in sport]] as instances of pain-based entertainment.

The '''tetractys''' ({{lang-el|τετρακτύς}}), or '''tetrad''',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=24vBaQDNy8UC|title=The Theosophical Glossary|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''tetractys of the decad'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=36|author=[[Eduard Zeller]]|title=Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophy|edition=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[triangular number|triangular figure]] consisting of ten points arranged in four rows: one, two, three, and four points in each row, which is the geometrical representation of the fourth [[triangular number]]. As a [[mysticism|mystical]] symbol, it was very important to the secret worship of [[Pythagoreanism]]. There were four seasons, and the number was also associated with planetary motions and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=DQpSA4CEnIwC| title = Pythagoras: pioneering mathematician and musical theorist of Ancient Greece| author = Dimitra Karamanides| publisher = The Rosen Publishing Group|year= 2005 |pages=65–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pythagorean symbol==

# The first four numbers symbolize the ''[[musica universalis]]'' and the [[Cosmos]] as: 
## (1) Unity ([[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]])
## (2) [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|Dyad]] – Power – Limit/Unlimited (peras/[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]])
## (3) Harmony (Triad)
## (4) Kosmos (Tetrad).&lt;ref&gt;''The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library'' by [[Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# The four rows add up to ten, which was unity of a higher order (The Dekad).
# The Tetractys symbolizes the [[classical element|four classical elements]]—[[fire]], [[air]], [[water]], and [[earth]].
# The Tetractys represented the organization of [[space]]:
## the first row represented zero [[dimension]]s (a [[Point (geometry)|point]])
## the second row represented one dimension (a [[Line (geometry)|line]] of two points)
## the third row represented [[Cartesian coordinate system#Cartesian coordinates in two dimensions|two dimensions]] (a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] defined by a [[triangle]] of three points)
## the fourth row represented [[Three-dimensional space (mathematics)|three dimensions]] (a [[tetrahedron]] defined by four points)

A [[prayer]] of the Pythagoreans shows the importance of the Tetractys (sometimes called the "Mystic Tetrad"), as the prayer was addressed to it.
{{quote|Bless us, divine number, thou who generated gods and men! O holy, holy Tetractys, thou that containest the root and source of the eternally flowing creation! For the divine number begins with the profound, pure unity until it comes to the holy four; then it begets the mother of all, the all-comprising, all-bounding, the first-born, the never-swerving, the never-tiring holy ten, the keyholder of all.&lt;ref&gt;Dantzig, Tobias ([1930], 2005) Number. The Language of Science. p.&amp;nbsp;42&lt;/ref&gt;}}
As a portion of the secret religion, [[Initiation|initiates]] were required to swear a secret oath by the Tetractys. They then served as novices for a period of silence lasting five years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

The Pythagorean oath also mentioned the Tetractys:
:By that pure, holy, four lettered name on high,
:nature's eternal fountain and supply,
:the parent of all souls that living be,
:by him, with faith find oath, I swear to thee."

It is said&lt;ref&gt;[[Introduction to Arithmetic]] – [[Nicomachus]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q-1o3tUGcXMC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=tetraktys+diatessaron&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R6YTUZrMAYXB0gWy_YCQDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tetraktys%20diatessaron&amp;f=false|title=The Musical Order of the World: Kepler, Hesse, Hindemith-Siglind Bruhn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0063:entry=musica-cn&amp;highlight=pythagorean%2Cpythagoras|title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities(1890) – William Smith, LLD, William Wayte, G.

==Kabbalist symbol==
[[Image:Boehme-heart.jpg|thumb|right|Symbol by early 17th-century Christian mystic [[Jakob Böhme]], including a tetractys of flaming Hebrew letters of the Tetragrammaton.]]
[[Image:Tetragrammaton-Tetractys.png|thumb|A tetractys of the letters of the Tetragrammaton adds up to 72 by [[gematria]].]]
There are some {{who?|date=April 2018}} who believe that the tetractys and its mysteries influenced the early [[Kabbalah]]. A Hebrew tetractys has the letters of the [[Tetragrammaton]] inscribed on the ten positions of the tetractys, from right to left. It has been argued that the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Kabbalistic Tree of Life]], with its ten spheres of emanation, is in some way connected to the tetractys, but its form is not that of a triangle. The occultist [[Dion Fortune]] writes: 
:The [[Point (geometry)|point]] is assigned to [[Keter|Kether]]; 
:the [[Line (geometry)|line]] to [[Chokhmah|Chokmah]];
:the two-dimensional [[plane (geometry)|plane]] to [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]]; 
:consequently the three-dimensional [[Solid geometry|solid]] naturally falls to [[Chesed]].&lt;ref&gt;The Mystical Qabalah, Dion Fortune, Chapter XVIII, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between geometrical shapes  and the first four [[Sephirot]] is analogous to the geometrical correlations in Tetraktys, shown above under &lt;span style="font-size:0.9em; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Pythagorean Symbol&lt;/span&gt;, and unveils the relevance of the Tree of Life with the Tetraktys.

==Tarot card reading arrangement==
In a [[Divinatory, esoteric and occult tarot|Tarot reading]], the various positions of the tetractys provide a representation for forecasting future events by signifying according to various occult disciplines, such as Alchemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/PT/D-tet.html|title=Tetractys Spread|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below is only a single variation for interpretation.

The first row of a single position represents the Premise of the reading, forming a foundation for understanding all the other cards.

The second row of two positions represents the cosmos and the individual and their relationship.
* The Light Card to the right represents the influence of the cosmos leading the individual to an action.
* The Dark Card to the left represents the reaction of the cosmos to the actions of the individual.

The third row of three positions represents three kinds of decisions an individual must make.
* The Creator Card is rightmost, representing new decisions and directions that may be made.
* The Sustainer Card is in the middle, representing decisions to keep balance, and things that should not change.
* The Destroyer Card is leftmost, representing old decisions and directions that should not be continued.

The fourth row of four positions represents the four Greek elements.
* The Fire card is rightmost, representing dynamic creative force, ambitions, and personal [[will (philosophy)|will]].
* The Water card is to the right middle, representing the [[emotion]]s, feelings, and whims.
* The Air card is to the left middle, representing the mind, [[thought]]s, and strategies toward goals.
* The Earth card is leftmost, representing physical [[reality|realities]] of day to day living.

==Occurrence==
[[Image:Template-Metropolitan Archbishop.svg|thumb|100px|right|[[Coat of arms]] of an [[archbishop]] of the [[Catholic Church]]]]
The tetractys occurs (generally coincidentally) in the following:
* the [[Eightfold Way (physics)|baryon decuplet]]
* an [[archbishop]]'s [[coat of arms]]
* the arrangement of pins in [[ten-pin bowling]]
* a [[Chinese checkers]] board
* the [[Formation_(association_football)#4–3–2–1 (the "Christmas Tree" formation)|"Christmas Tree" formation]] in [[association football]]

==In poetry==
In English-language poetry, a tetractys is a syllable-counting form with five lines.  The first line has one syllable, the second has two syllables, the third line has three syllables, the fourth line has four syllables, and the fifth line has ten syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://www.volecentral.co.uk/vf/englishsyllable.htm#Tetractys|title=English Syllable Counters}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A sample tetractys would look like this:

:''&lt;span style="font-size:0.9em; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Mantrum&lt;/span&gt;
:''Your /
:''fury /
:''confuses /
:''us all greatly. /
:''Volatile, big-bodied tots are selfish.  //''

The tetractys was created by Ray Stebbing, who said the following about his newly created form:

:''"The tetractys could be Britain's answer to the haiku. Its challenge is to express a complete thought, profound or comic, witty or wise, within the narrow compass of twenty syllables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bensonofjohn.co.uk/poetry/formssearch.php?searchbox=Tetractys Search result for Tetractys]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Verbal language in dreams''' is the speech—most commonly in the form of a dialogue between the dreamer him/herself and other dream characters—which forms part of the overall (mostly imagistic) dream scenario. Historically, there have been abundant references to verbal language in dreams going back millennia.  Early in the twentieth century German [[psychiatrist]] [[Emil Kraepelin]] presented a large corpus of dream speech, almost all from his own dreams and virtually all deviant, without any pretense that this was representative of dream speech in general. The first systematic elicitation of verbal language in dreams from a large subject pool under methodological protocols was presented beginning in the early 1980s, along with detailed analyses as well as theoretical consideration of the implications for various dream models, from the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] approach to more recent theories.

==Dream language in history==
Traditionally, dreams have been defined predominantly in imagistic terms.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the German psychologist K.A. Scherner in his book ''Das Leben des  Traumes'' (1861, cited by Freud 1900/1953 ''The Interpretation of Dreams,'' in James Strachey ed. and trans. ''The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud,'' vols 4-5, Hogarth Press, p. 84) states that the dreaming imagination is "without the power of conceptual speech [and therefore] obliged to paint what it says pictorially"; Funk and Wagnall's Standard Dictionary of the English Language of 1895 defined "to dream" as "to have a train of images or fantasies pass through the mind in sleep"; a recent edition of the ''Oxford Dictionary of Current English'' defines dream as a "vision, series of pictures or events presented to the sleeping person."&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent dream theories of the modern era from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychoanalytic model (1900) to the present have similarly placed emphasis of the visual aspects of dreams. Yet, even the earliest of written sources, such as the [[Hebrew Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 28: 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Odyssey]]&lt;ref&gt;Book 6&lt;/ref&gt; make clear that dreams need not be "[[silent movies]]"; they may be "[[talking pictures|talkies]]" incorporating a "sound track" abounding in verbal dialogues or monologues.&lt;ref&gt;Verbal language in dreams is distinct from the phenomenon of [[sleeptalking]], that is, actual articulation out loud during sleep. As reported from a series of experiments by Alan Arkin (''Sleeptalking: Psychology and Psychophysiology''; Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc., 1981), most sleeptalking occurs not during [[REM-sleep]] (the neurological periods of sleep most associated with vivid dreaming) but during non-REM sleep. Even of those sleeptalking episodes which do occur during REM sleep, only about half show any obviously discernible relation with the dream reports elicited from the subject when awakened immediately following the sleeptalking.&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey by Heynick of several books containing over 300 dreams, both genuine reports and dreams incorporated into works of fiction, showed that some three-quarters contained verbal dialogue or explicit reference to speech in the dream.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), p.26&lt;/ref&gt; As a specimen of a dream with dialogue as part of a famous work of fiction, Heynick cites the dream of Charles Swann, the main character in [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]'s ''[[Swann's Way]]'' (1913; italics added):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The painter remarked to Swann [the dreamer] ''that Napoleon III had eclipsed himself immediately after Odette. "They had obviously arranged it between them,"'' he added; ''"they must have agreed to meet at the foot of the cliff, but they wouldn't say good-bye together, it might have looked odd. She is his mistress."'' The strange young man burst into tears. Swann endeavored to console him. ''"After all, she is quite right,"'' he said to the young man, drying his eyes for him and taking off his fez to make him feel more at ease. ''"I've advised her to do that myself a dozen times. Why be so distressed? He was obviously the man to understand her."''&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), p.26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1906 Kraepelin, a pioneer of the somatic approach to psychiatry and of the methodical classification of psychiatric disorders, published a 105-page monograph ''Über Sprachstörungen im Traume'' (On Speech Disorders in Dreams).&lt;ref&gt;Emil Kraepelin 1906 ''Über Sprachstörungen im Traume''; Engelmann Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; As the title suggests, Kraepelin's declared aim was to analyze only deviant specimens of speech from dreams. Specimens reflecting correct speech processes were excluded from his study. To this end, Kraepelin assembled in the course of twenty years 286 specimens, the vast majority drawn from his own dreams, with no pretense to nonselectivity. He apparently drew in large measure from [[hypnagogia|hypnagogic]] and occasionally [[hypnopompic]] dreamlets (experienced when falling asleep and waking up), which differ [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomologically]] from full-fledged dreams and are characterized by different neurological indices as well.

Kraepelin meticulously classified his collection of dreams according to the nature of the deviances from correct normal speech in wakefulness.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt; Three-fifths of his specimens were grouped as disorders of word selection, including large numbers of neologisms (non-existing words, typically formed by combinations of existing words or their components); just over one-fifth as disorders of discourse (actaphasia, usually involving the incorrect choice of language dependency relations; and agrammatism, the faulty construction of complex sentences); and just under one fifth as disorders of thought. Although it was well known at the time that the speech of normal people in wakefulness is often fraught with errors,&lt;ref&gt;In 1895 Rudolf Meringer and [[Karl Mayer]] published ''Versprechen und Verlesen, eine psychologische-linguistische Studie'' (Slips of Speech and Reading, a Psychological-Linguistic Study) containing and analyzing over 8000 specimens of linguistic errors from normal people in waking life; this study is mentioned in Kraepelin's monograph.&lt;/ref&gt; Kraepelin prized his corpus of deviant dream speech for the profound nature of many of the errors they contained, different from the common slips of the tongue made by mentally healthy people in everyday life. He likened various specimens of his dream speech corpus to the speech in waking life of patients with dementia praecox (schizophrenia), speech confusion, and aphasia. Kraeplin saw his dream experiences as affording him (a normal person) first-hand insight into these pathological processes. He further speculated on neurological concomitants involving the activities and interaction of areas of the brain—the [[cerebral cortex]], [[Wernicke's area|Wernicke's coil]], [[Broca's area|Broca's coil]]—which are different from in normal wakefulness. Although several of Kraepelin's dream speech specimens are amenable to interpretation for their latent sexual significance,&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;  he had no interest in the psychoanalytic approach and made no reference to his contemporary Freud in any of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;Kraepelin's full 1906 monograph is published in English translation in Heynick (1993), which also includes English translations of three relevant shorter pieces by Kraepelin's contemporaries Ernst Meumann, Friederich Hacker, and [[Alfred Hoche]]. In the mid-1980s a cache of Kraepelin's notations was discovered in Munich which showed that for two decades after the publication of his 1906 monograph he had continued to record specimens of his dream speech, an additional 391 in toto. These, too, were included in Heynick (1993), presented for the first time in their original German as well as in English translation along with Kraepelin's notes and an analysis and categorization by the author. Verbal material presented in print in dreams and read by the dreamer, a phenomen treated by Meumann and mentioned by Freud (1900) and Kraepelin (1906), is considered in Heynick (1993), pp. 52-62 and in Frank Heynick 1985 "Verbal behavior in dreams; neurobiological implications for LSP reading?," in A.K. Pugh &amp; J.M. Ulijn (eds.) ''Reading for Professional Purposes: Studies and Practices in Native and Foreign Languages''. Heinemann, pp.321-341.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1980s, therefore, no indices or standards existed that were representative of the verbal language component of the dreams of a large general population. But beginning in 1983, Heynick reported in a series of publications the results of two experiments designed to evaluate, first, the linguistic competence and, subsequently, the pragmatic competence of the dreamer in the dreaming state, using large subject pools drawn from the general population (in this case in the [[Netherlands]]) and following careful protocols designed to avoid selectivity and maximize accuracy of recall.

==Linguistic performance==
The term "linguistic performance," central to this experiment, derives from the transformational-generative (TG) revolution in linguistics in the second half of the twentieth century and the concomitant emergence of the field of formal psycholinguistics. The TG model of language generation assumes an ideal "linguistic competence" on the part of the speaker, theoretically enabling him or her to generate all the infinite number of well-formed sentences in the native language while generating none of the ill-formed sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 212-14&lt;/ref&gt; That in actual use, i.e., linguistic performance, the speaker is limited in, among other things, the complexity or elaboration of the sentences he or she can generate, and often produces utterances which are ill-formed, is due to the limitations of the various auxiliary psychological mechanisms at the speaker's disposal, such as limited short-term memory, perceptual limitations, and defective feedback, as well as to factors such as deliberate changes in structure in mid-sentence, and unconscious interference of the Freudian type.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Victoria A. Fromkin, ed., 1980 ''Errors in Linguistic Performance: Slips of the Tongue, Ear, Pen, and Hand'', Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the above has traditionally applied to the native speaker in the waking state. The experiment explored the linguistic performance of the native speaker in the dreaming state.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp.223-45; Frank Heynick 1991 "Linguistic and literary creativity in dreams: a psychoanalytic and experimental approach," in J. Gackenbach (ed.) ''Dream Images'', pp.79-86, Baywood.&lt;/ref&gt;

78 Dutch subjects sleeping at home recorded on special forms following precise protocol instructions a total of 566 Dutch utterances directly recalled and transcribed from 566 dreams which had been in progress prior to alarm clock awakening in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 223-28&lt;/ref&gt; (For just over 80 percent of all awakenings, there was either no dream in progress at the time of awakening or no verbal material to be reported from the dream.) The subjects reported (as part of the questionnaire form) that 60 percent of the utterances were said by him or herself in the dream scenario; 40 percent by someone else, usually addressed to the dreamer.
 
Word-count analysis showed the utterances in the corpus to have a wide range of length, with a  mean utterance length of 7.5 words and a mean sentence length of 6.5 words. The declarative sentences in the corpus were analyzed for complexity (sentential elaboration) using in particular the number of subordinate clauses per unit as an index. The corpus when classed into three groups according to the education level of the subject-dreamers showed that those with most education had the highest sentential elaboration; those with the least, the lowest; with those with intermediate education scoring in between. (There were no standards available for absolute comparison with the sentential elaboration in spoken Dutch in waking life by the three education-level groups in the general population; however, the relative degree of sentential elaboration of the dream corpus of the three education-level groups accorded with the relative indices for written Dutch by the three educational-level groups, which were available for comparison.)&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp.239-241&lt;/ref&gt;

72 of the 566 utterances were marked by their respective subjects (in response to one of the questions on the form) as deviating from wakeful usage, although analysis of the same specimens by two academic linguists deemed the large majority of those marked utterances to be fully acceptable Dutch. Fewer than 5 percent of all utterances clearly deviated from correct wakeful speech. These included semantic anomalies, faulty lexical substitutions, neologisms (word-blends), non-existent proper names, language mixing, and (in two instances) syntactic errors.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp.225-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pragmatic competence==
The subjects in the above experiment were not asked to report the full dream scenario during which the utterances were made. Excluded, therefore, from the analysis was any consideration of "pragmatic competence," the "knowledge of condition and manner or appropriate use [of his or her linguistic ability] in conformity with various purposes,"&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky 1980 ''Rules and Representations''; Basil Blackwell p.224; Chomsky, the founder of TG linguistics viewed pragmatic competence as outside the scope of TG&lt;/ref&gt; which forms part of the broader field of language psychology (rather than formal psycholinguistics).
 
Dream utterances ''plus'' their dream scenario contexts were gathered in a second experiment,&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp.254-259; Frank Heynick 1986 "The dream-scripter and the Freudian ego: pragmatic competence and superordinate and subordinate cognitive systems in sleep," ''Journal of Mind and Behavior'', 7 (2/3), pp.169-201&lt;/ref&gt; again following carefully defined protocols, this time using the telephone elicitation technique. (Volunteer subjects were awakened on random nights at random hours, on average no more than once a week.) 77 dream reports from 33 subjects were tape-recorded and transcribed. These contained 92 dream speech utterances elicited verbatim from the subjects immediately after provoked awakening (to minimize deterioration in memory recall) plus an additional 113 utterances (81 in direct verbatim form, 32 in indirect form) contained in the subsequent telling of the entire dream. 40 percent of the utterances were said by the dreamer; 60 percent by someone else in the dream scenario, usually addressed to the dreamer (a reversal of the proportions in the linguistic performance experiment).

Five scorers, working independently but achieving a high degree of interscorer reliability, rated the appropriateness of each of the 205 dreams utterances to their situational context in the dream. Averaged out (and rounded off), 67% of the utterances were deemed to be "entirely suitable to the narrative"; 20% "not entirely suitable"; 7% "largely unsuitable"; and 4% "entirely unsuitable."&lt;ref&gt;There can be no access by an outside observer to the utterances said or heard by the dreamer in the dream. As with all aspects of the dream, including the visual, the experimenter can base his or her findings only on the report given by the dreamer in the waking state. While discussing the obvious problem that subjects may inadvertently be correcting deviances when reporting their dream utterances even immediately after awakening, Heynick (1993), pp.232-234, points out that, unlike the visual and other aspects of dreams, verbal language in dreams has the advantage of easily being reported in the same modality (words) in which it was experienced and of being especially quantifiable.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, in the following dream all lines of dialogue were deemed by all scorers (in the first instance, by four or the five scorers) to be fully suitable to the narrative:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was sitting in the garden and reading old magazines. [...] My son [...] took a little girlfriend along, also about five, and she started looking through the magazines. And they were getting wet, since she had such a cold that her nose ran. And I said ''that she, your little girlfriend, should rinse her nose with the lotah'', that's a jug used in yoga [instead of a handkerchief]. I use it myself, too. So I let her do it, but because she was so small, it didn't go right, and she started to cry. And then she walked home. So I said to my little boy, ''"I'll go to her mother and tell her what happened, otherwise she'll think 'what a strange lady.'"'' [...] Then that girl came out again, and my son had already told her mother that I had tried to help her get rid of her cold with the lotah. I simply knew that he had said that, but I didn't hear him say that literally. Then I said to that girl ''"In the future, when you catch a cold, you should go to the doctor and have him write out a prescription for medicine."&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), p.258; as per the protocol, the last utterance ("In the future ... [etc.].") was elicited immediately after awakening; subsequently, the rest of the dream, including the other utterances, was elicited&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In general, the dreamer as (to continue the film metaphor) "script-writer" appears to have at his or her command not just a "story grammar" capable of generating a reasonably, though not always, coherent  overall scenario, but also the linguistic pragmatic competence to generate verbal dialogue which is usually, though again not always, appropriate to that scenario.

==Theoretical implications for dream models==
The abundance of verbal language in dreams—typically in the form of dialogue between the dreamer and other characters in the dream scenario—which generally shows a syntactic and lexical well-formedness comparable to speech in the waking state, and which in addition is, far more often than not, appropriate to the dream context, has, in Heynick's theoretical analysis, profound consequences for overall dream theories, past and present.

===Psychoanalytic model===
Freud's psychoanalytic model of the mind and, in particular, his theory of dream generation and its function posit the existence of two global modes of mental functioning. The primary process, characterized by such mechanisms as condensations, displacements, and reversals (and the absence of any sense of negation) is theoretically characteristic of the infantile mode of thinking. It is superseded in the course of ontogeny by the development of the conscious part of the mind, which in the older child and adult is governed by the secondary process, adhering to the rules of grammar and logic. The verbal language which the developing child acquires is for Freud by definition a secondary process. The primary process in psychoanalytic theory is however not banished from the mind, but is contained in the unconscious, where  it continues to characterize the mode of functioning of that part of the psyche.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 12-21&lt;/ref&gt;

The unconscious with its primary process mode—along with its repressed ideational content from early childhood, such as the Oedipus complex—provides, in Freud's theory, the driving force and initial input to dreams. Freud attributed the generation of a more or less coherent dream narrative to the process of "secondary revision," which might (he vacillated on this issue) be "a contribution on the part of waking thought to the construction of dreams" rather than part of the "dream work" proper. The dream-like features which one experiences in dreams, such as condensations, displacements (symbolism), and reversals, are the manifestations of the primary-process input to the dream generation process.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Heynick 1981 "Linguistic aspects of  Freud's dream model," ''International Review of Psycho-Analysis'', 8 (3), pp.299-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet the dreams of Freud's own and those of his patients, which he provides in ''The Interpretation of Dreams'' and elsewhere, typically abound in verbal dialogue, which is always syntactically well-formed, often complex (containing subordinate clauses) and usually, though not always, semantically well-formed and appropriate to the context of the dream.

As an example, Heynick cites, among others, the "dream of Irma's injection, which Freud himself considered to be of central importance to the development of his dream theory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I said to Irma: ''"If you still get pains, it's really your own fault."'' She replied: ''"If you only knew what pains I've got in my throat and stomach and abdomen—it's choking me."'' [...] I at once ''called in'' Dr. M. [who] looked quite different from usual; he was very pale, he walked with a limp and his chin was clean shaven. [...] My friend Leopold was [...] saying, ''"She has a dull area down on the left."'' He also indicated that a portion of the skin of the left shoulder was infiltrated. (I noticed this, just as he did, in spite of her dress.) [...] M. said: ''"There's no doubt it's an infection, but no matter, dysentery will supervene and the toxin will be eliminated."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud 1900/1953 op cit., p.107)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Virtually all the deep personal significance which Freud in his analysis attributed to his Irma dream would be lost without the verbal dialogue. Yet the utterances are fully grammatical; they contain properly embedded and conjoined clauses, two conditional phrases, a future tense, and two instances of negation. All words are proper German (in the original). Semantically most of the dialogue appears appropriate to the overall scenario, except the last which is medically absurd.&lt;ref&gt;While the dialogue in all the dreams Freud presents are syntactically well formed and show a range of syntactic complexity, there are occasional instance of "primary process" interference on the lexical level, as in the case of the neologism (word blend) in the utterance ''"That's the breakfast-ship!"'' in his dream of the castle by the sea. These Freud analyzed, in the same manner as he did slips of the tongue in wakefulness in his ''Psychopathology of Everyday Life'' (1901) for their latent unconscious meanings. Heynick (1993), pp. 19-21, 47&lt;/ref&gt;

====Replay hypothesis====
Freud was apparently confronted with the enigma of how the generation of speech, a secondary process par excellence, could be functioning at such a apparently high level of adequacy during dreaming, the input and motive power of which involves a theoretically primary process. Freud attempted to resolve this problem by introducing his "replay hypothesis" (as Heynick terms it), according to which the dialogue in dreams is merely a repeating, in the same or similar words, of speech actually said or heard by the dreamer recently in waking life, usually on the day before the dream, only slightly modified (if at all) by the above-mentioned process of "secondary revision." This theoretical regression to an infantile mimicking of speech thus denied to the dreaming process proper any substantial language functioning or (in modern terms) linguistic competence.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 28-31; Frank Heynick 1985 "Dream dialogue and retrogression: neurobiological origins of Freud's 'replay hypothesis,'" ''Journal of the History of  the Behavioral Sciences'', 21 (4), pp.321-341.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a view to testing the validity of Freud's replay hypothesis, the subject-dreamers in the above-mentioned experiment on linguistic competence were asked with regard to each of their dream speech specimens whether they could recall having said the utterance prior to the dream in waking life in the same or similar words. The subjects deemed that to have been the case on the day before the dream for 8% of the utterances and for the week before the dream (including the day before the dream) for 14% of the utterances. Such low figures appear to invalidate Freud's replay hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 235-36&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neo-Freudian revisionism====
Although no neo-Freudians treat the phenomenon of dream speech per se, proposed revisions to the psychoanalytic model of the mind by theorists such as Gill, Holt and Noy,{{who|date=October 2012}} beginning in the late 1960s, variously included the redefining of the place of speech generation (in wakefulness, but this would also apply to speech during dreaming) whereby it would no longer necessarily be classified as a strictly secondary process.&lt;ref&gt;Merton M. Gill 1967 "The primary process," in Robert R, Holt, ed., ''Motives and Thoughts: Psychoanalytic Essays in Honor of David Rapaport''; International Universities Press, pp.260-298; Robert R. Holt 1967 "The development of the primary process: a structural view," ''Psychological Issues'', 5, p.345; Pinchas Noy  1969 "A revision of the psychoanalytic theory of the primary process," ''International Journal of Psycho-Analysis'' 50, pp. 155-178; Pinchas Noy 1979 "The psychoanalytic theory of cognitive development," ''Psychoanalytic Study of the Child'' 34, pp. 169-216.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such revisions would, Heynick points out, potentially make the phenomenon of verbal language in dreams less anomalous in the psychoanalytic scheme, and without the need to resort, as Freud did, to the replay hypothesis as an "ad hoc" expedient.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp.259-62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern models of dream generation===

====Activation-synthesis hypothesis====
The [[activation-synthesis hypothesis]] of dream generation first proposed by [[Harvard University]] [[psychiatrist]]s [[Allan Hobson|John Allan Hobson]] and [[Robert McCarley]] in the late 1970s drew upon the discovery earlier in the decade of the ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) impulses which during the nightly REM periods (the physiological stage of sleep which is most associated with the phenomenological experience of vivid dreaming) are fired off from the brain stem and travel to the visual areas of the cortex.&lt;ref&gt;J. Allan Hobson &amp; Robert McCarley  1977 "The brain as dream-state generator: an activation-synthesis hypothesis," ''American Journal of Psychiatry'' 134, pp. 1335-48&lt;/ref&gt;

In the visual area of the cortex, according to the model, the impulses call up largely at random a series of images (=activation). The dreamer's sleeping consciousness automatically tries to integrate these images into a more or less coherent story, while, for example, linking them with fragments of memory from the past (=synthesis). (Similar mechanisms involving the PGO impulses have been incorporated into other dream models, namely [[Francis Crick]] and Graeme Mitchison's [[reverse learning]] theory and Michael Jouvet's endogenous learning hypothesis.)&lt;ref&gt;Francis Crick &amp; Graeme Mitchison 1983 "The function of sleep," ''Nature'' 304, pp.111-114; Michel Jouvet 1999 ''The Paradox of Sleep: The Story of Dreaming'', MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The activation-synthesis hypothesis, although based on neurological data more advanced than was ever available to Freud, is reminiscent of Freud's psychoanalytic model in that the initial input to the process is primitive and chaotic, onto which some order in imposed by a cognitively more advanced process. But as for the psychological interpretation of dreams the authors of the activation-synthesis hypothesis are outspokenly anti-Freudian, in that in their model the initial input to the dreaming process (the PGO-impulses) are devoid of any depth-psychology significance, Oedipal or whatever. (If the dream acquires any significance relating to the dreamer's personality. history, and present circumstances, this occurs in the manner in which the more or less randomly evoked images are integrated into a story during the synthesis stage, analogous to what a subject may "see" in the random ink-blots of a Rorschach test.)&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 265-66&lt;/ref&gt;

Be this as it may, the activation-synthesis hypothesis with its overwhelming emphasis on visual areas of the cortex is silent as to how the extensive verbal language may be generated and integrated into the dream scenario. Heynick cites as ironic a specimen dream which Hobson presents as exemplary of production by the activation-synthesis model:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am in Willianstown, Massachusetts, talking to a colleague, Van, who is wearing a white shirt (he usually wears blue) open at the neck (he is normally necktied, and even collar-clipped) and khakis (he usually sports flannels). Casual. Van says, as if by the way, ''that he attended the committee meeting that has yesterday considered my candidacy for an invited lecture series.'' (I know from his tone that he is going to deliver bad news.) The committee has decided against it because ''"They don't feel that psychoanalysis should be confronted with laboratory data."
I allowed at how bad this idea was. ''"It's the wrong reason,"'' I said. ''"And their timing is off, because Adolf Grünbaum is just about to publish his important new book in which he insists that that is precisely what psychoanalysis must do."'' Van ignores this statement, appearing never to have heard of A.G.
[...]
We go out a door (which is on the corner of the building) to behold the beautiful Williams campus. A red-brick wall extends down a green lawn to the classic white Puritan buildings.
Van says, ''"They chose Mary"'' (or seems to say that) ''"reflecting their priorities to attract a speaker who might help them with their fund-raising efforts."'' ''"That's why you have such beautiful buildings," I note, "and why there is nothing in them."''&lt;ref&gt;J. Allan Hobson 1988 ''The Dreaming Brain'', Basic Books, pp.232-33; in Heynick (1993), pp. 266-67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hobson presents this specimen as an example of how dreams can sometimes reflect personal concerns—in this case relating to his academic squabbles with his colleagues due to his anti-psychoanalytic stance within the psychiatric profession. As Heynick points out, the personal significance in this dream is in fact derived almost exclusively from the verbal dialogue, without which the dream would lose all its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 266-268&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychoneirics model====
The psychoneirics (from Greek; psycho = mind + oneiros = dream) model of dream generation, formulated by Foulkes from the late 1970s onwards, is cited&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 275-77&lt;/ref&gt;  as an exemplary model (though not necessarily the only possible type of model) of how the generation of verbal language can be incorporated into the generation of the overall dream scenario. Patterned on the psycholinguistic model of speech production (in wakefulness), the psychoneirics model is basically non-neurological. It views dream generation in humans as, like speech in humans, a skillful cognitive act, in fact possibly drawing upon the selfsame cognitive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;David Foulkes  1982 "A cognitive-psychological model of REM dream production," ''Sleep'' 5, pp. 169-187; David Foulkes 1985 ''Dreaming: A Cognitive-Psychological Approach'', Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The input to the dreaming process involves (not unlike the activation-synthesis hypothesis of dreaming) the diffuse activation of memory elements. Psychoneirics focuses on the midrange dream generation processes (regardless of whether or not the dream happens to include verbal dialogue) as involving "schematic selection" and "element activation," analogous to the syntactic frame (sentence structure) selection and word selection of psycholinguistic models. (The dream-like features of dreams, such as condensations (composite images) and anomalous narrative shifts, are seen as residual flux of the dream production mechanism, which is otherwise doing a reasonably good job of developing the initial input into a coherent narrative.) Under this theoretical assumption that the human dream-generation ability and speech-generation ability (in wakefulness) derive from similar cognitive capacities, the psychoneirics model can claim to seamlessly account for the generation of verbal dialogue within dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Foulkes is highly sceptical of the concept that dreams may contain useful information or serve as an adjunct in psychotherapy. Heynick points out that the components and mechanisms of the psychoneiric model, although quite different from the psychoanalytic, are nevertheless not necessarily incompatible with Freudian views on the value of dreams. Frank Heynick 1987, "Review of David Foulkes' ''Dreaming: A Cognitive-Psychological Approach''," ''International Review of Psycho-Analysis'', 14 (2), pp.279-283.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for psycholinguistics and language psychology==
The data presented in the above experiments is considered as having implications not just for the evaluation of the various existing models of dream generation, but also for models of speech generation in general, that is in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 280-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dreaming is a state of consciousness different from the normal wakeful state. With regard to actions within the dream, dreaming consciousness is presumably characterized by a diminished capacity for deliberate intention on the part of the dreamer (including intention of what to say or, as scriptwriter, what to have other characters say) and a diminished attention to, or diminished ability to receive and monitor feedback from, the actions (including speech acts) as they are being carried out in the dream.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 216-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristics of dialogue in dreams indicate that despite the presumed diminished intention, attention and feedback on the part of the dreamer as speaker-listener and scriptwriter, the utterances generated, far more often than not, are semantically and syntactically well-formed and appropriate to the overall scenario. The implication is that the human capacity for language in general (that is, in everyday wakefulness) can largely rely on processes which, once they are triggered when the conditions match those required for their operation, can generate verbal utterances automatically, outside of awareness and without the need for intervention by the speaker except at points where some critical choice is made.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick's analysis of dream speech makes little reference to the neurological concomitants of the psycholinguistic processes operating in the dream state and how their functioning may differ neurologically from wakefulness. Mention is made of the reports by some researchers of a shift of dominant cortical activity in REM sleep to the minor ("right") hemisphere, involved in imagistic and creative thought, and away from the major ("left") hemisphere, known to be responsible for verbal and logical thinking—a shift which, if it indeed occurs, would predict a diminished linguistic capacity in dreaming. Heynick points sooner to the concepts in the Unified Model of sentence generation (Gary Dell &amp; Peter Reich 1980 "Towards a unified model of slips of the tongue," in V.A. Fromkin, ed., ''Errors In Linguistic Performance: Slips of the Tongue, Ear, Pen, and Hand'', Academic Press) and posits that the quasi-neurological "spreading activation" which in wakefulness allows for largely automated sentence generation, with occasional errors due to "leakage," is functioning on a more or less comparable level during dreaming in REM sleep; but that under the peculiar neurological circumstances of the hypnagogic state (when falling asleep) an excessive leakage in the system may tend to produce highly deviant verbal language of the kind Kraepelin reported in his 1906 monograph (Heynick 1993, pp. 228-231)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Victim feminism''' is a term used by some liberal and [[Individualist feminism|libertarian feminist]]s in the 1990s to contrast their conceptions of feminism with other feminists who they view as reinforcing the idea that women are weak or lacking in agency, and therefore need to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

Two features of victim feminism according to Wolf are: identifying with powerlessness even at the expense of taking responsibility for the power women do possess; and putting community first, hence being hostile toward individual achievement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Naomi Wolf]] contrasts victim feminism with '''power feminism'''. In her view, victim feminists present women as "beleaguered, fragile, intuitive angels" thus preventing women from taking responsibility for the power they actually have. Among various attributes of victim feminism, Wolf writes that it projects violence and competitiveness onto men or their [[patriarchy]], while disregarding these qualities in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cole | first = Alyson Manda | chapter = Victims on a pedestal: anti-"victim feminism" and women's oppression | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=SwSKhV0TXCIC&amp;pg=PA50 | title = The cult of true victimhood: from the war on welfare to the war on terror |pages= 50–51 | publisher = Stanford University Press | location = Stanford, California | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780804754613 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colin Grant described Wolf's power vs. victim dichotomy as being rooted in differences in how feminists address the liabilities that women suffer: while victim feminism simply dwells on them, power feminism seeks to identify them, with the purpose to challenge and overcome them. Grant also mentions that Wolf herself appears to have embraced both sides: her book ''[[The Beauty Myth]]'' seems to be from the victim feminism camp, but with ''[[Fire with Fire (Naomi Wolf book)|Fire with Fire]]'' Wolf transitions to the power feminism side.&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grant | first = Colin | chapter = A sex myth: feminist proposals | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=dNwGtVrKSXUC&amp;pg=PA122 | title = Myths we live by |pages=122–124 | publisher = University of Ottawa Press | location = Ottawa, Ontario | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780776604442 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dichotomy of "victim" vs "power" was criticized for being defined too broadly so that Wolf's argument became lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Astrid | chapter = Daughterhood is powerful: the emergence of feminism's third wave | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=W4U4Ss1OZGoC&amp;pg=PA28 | title = Not my mother's sister: generational conflict and third-wave feminism | page = 28 | publisher = Indiana University Press | location = Bloomington, Indiana | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780253111227 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition it lumps together diverse and radically different feminist schools, and this confusion aids [[antifeminist]]s in their rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hammer | first = Rhonda | chapter = Culture wars over feminism: Paglia, Wolf, and Hoff Sommers | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=CVZdU_trRdQC&amp;pg=PA61 | title = Antifeminism and family terrorism: a critical feminist perspective | pages = 61–62 | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | location = Lanham, Maryland | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780742510500 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victim feminism was described as a negative tendency in [[gender feminism]]. The more positive tendency recognizes the distinctiveness of women's experience and views (regarding sex, morality, etc.) as a positive alternative in contrast to that imposed by the "patriarchal" views of men.&lt;ref name="Grant" /&gt;

Naomi Wolf's ''Fire with Fire'' and [[Katie Roiphe]]'s ''[[The Morning After (book)|The Morning After]]'', met with considerable media attention,  were described as part of the backlash against the perceived domination of the feminist theme of victimization in the contemporary popular culture.&lt;ref name=ems&gt;{{cite book | last = Schneider | first = Elizabeth M. | author-link = Elizabeth Schneider | chapter = Beyond victimization and agency | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=F0jrQ28IpZgC&amp;pg=PA74 | title = Battered women &amp; feminist lawmaking | pages = 74–75 | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780300128932 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Wolf's and Roiphe's arguments is that emphasis on victimization reinforces the stereotype of women being fragile and vulnerable. However it was argued that their solution in the form of "power feminism" is simplistic, because it fails to take into an account the systemic nature of women's subordination. Overall, the "victim vs. power" dichotomy was described as false and fundamentally inadequate, and leading to "problematic extremes".&lt;ref name=ems/&gt;

[[Gender studies]] scholar Rebecca Stringer writes that besides Wolf and Roiphe, other feminist authors have criticized the representation of women as victims and promoted a brand of agency-affirming feminism. These include [[Camille Paglia]], [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], [[Natasha Walter]], and [[Rene Denfeld]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stringer | first = Rebecca | chapter = Victims left, right and centre: constructing 'victim feminism' |chapterurl= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QK3cAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17 | title = Knowing Victims: Feminism, agency and victim politics in neoliberal times |pages=17–18 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | location = Hoboken | year = 2014 |language=en | isbn = 9781134746019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these authors wrote popular books in the 1990s about feminism framed as calls to action like earlier works by [[Betty Friedan]] and [[Germaine Greer]], but instead of agitating for political and economic change, they often argued in favour of the status quo.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Stringer, this trend of 1990s agitation against "victim feminism" is tied to the concurrent rise of [[neoliberalism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the same time, in her book ''Knowing Victims'' Stringer argues that these critiques of "victim feminism" do not affirm women's agency, but rather problematize women's capacity for agency and declare a lack of women's personal responsibility, which is, in Stringer's view, akin to [[victim blaming]].&lt;ref&gt;Stringer, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Schneider]] criticizes the dichotomy of feminism in the form of  "victimhood vs. agency" from the legal standpoint, arguing that the view of women as either victims or agents is incomplete and static. She points out that, first, both concepts are too narrow and incomplete, and second, they are not the opposite poles of a spectrum, they are independent, but interrelated dimensions of women's experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Schneider | first = Elizabeth M. | author-link = Elizabeth Schneider | title = Feminism and the False Dichotomy of Victimization and Agency | journal = New York Law School Law Review | volume = 38 | pages = 387–399 | url = http://brooklynworks.brooklaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1356&amp;context=faculty | year = 1993}} Also available as [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/nyls38&amp;div=29&amp;id=&amp;page= HeinOnline].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water cure''' is a form of [[torture]] in which the victim is forced to drink large quantities of water in a short time, resulting in [[gastric distension]], [[water intoxication]], and possibly [[death]].&lt;ref name=lens /&gt;&lt;ref name=Korry2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zeller2007 /&gt;

Often the victim has the [[Human mouth|mouth]] forced or wedged open, the [[Human nose|nose]] closed with pincers and a [[funnel]] or strip of cloth forced down the throat. The victim has to drink all the [[water]] (or other [[liquid]]s such as bile or urine) poured into the funnel to avoid [[drowning]]. The stomach fills until near bursting and is sometimes beaten until the victim [[vomiting|vomits]] and the torture begins again.

While this use of water as a form of torture is documented back to at least the 15th century,&lt;ref name=npr /&gt; the first use of the phrase '''water cure''' in this sense is indirectly dated to around 1898, by [[U.S. Army|U.S. soldiers]] in the [[Spanish–American War]],&lt;ref name=wp /&gt;{{efn|The late 19th century expropriation of the term ''water cure'', already in use in the therapeutic sense, to denote the polar opposite of therapy, namely torture, has the hallmark of arising in the sense of irony.

== Historical uses ==

=== East-Indies ===
The use of the water cure by the Dutch in the East-Indies is documented by the English merchants of the East India Company after the [[Amboyna massacre]] in February 1623 (stilo veteri). The procedure is described in great detail by the survivors of the incident.&lt;ref name="UIN: BLL01011844448"&gt;{{cite book|title=A True Relation of the late unjust, cruel and barbarous proceedings against the English at Amboyna|year=1624|publisher=John Skinner of the East India Company|location=British Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The manner of his torture was as follows: First they hoisted him up by the hands with a cord on a large door, where they made him fast upon two staples of iron, fixed on both sides, at the top of the door posts, having his hands one from the other as wide as they could stretch. Being thus made fast, his feet hung some two foot from the ground; which also they stretched asunder as far as they would stretch, and so made them fast beneath unto the door trees on each side. Then they bound a cloth about his neck and face so close, that little or no water could go by. That done, they poured the water softly upon his head until the cloth was full, up to the mouth and nostrils, and somewhat higher; so that he could not draw breath, but he must with all suck in the water: which being still continued to be poured in softly, forced all his inward parts, come out of his nose, ears, eyes, and often as it were stifling and choking him, at length took away his breath, and brought him to a swoon or fainting. Then they took him quickly down, and made him vomit up the water. Being a little recovered, they trussed him up again, and poured water as before, taking him down as soon as he seemed to be stifled. In this manner they handled him three or four several times with water, until his body was swollen twice or thrice as big as before, his cheeks like great bladders, and his eyes staring and strutting out beyond his forehead.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== France ===
[[File:Marquise de Brinvilliers.jpg|thumb|right|Marquise of Brinvilliers being tortured.]]

Water torture was used extensively and legally by the courts of France from the [[Middle Ages]] to the 17th and 18th centuries.  It was known as being put to "the question", with the '''ordinary question''' involving the forcing of one gallon (eight [[pint]]s or approximately 3.6 [[litre]]s) of water into the stomach and the '''extraordinary question''' involving the forcing of two gallons (sixteen pints or approximately 7.3 litres).

The French poet and criminal [[François Villon]] was subjected to this torture in 1461.&lt;ref name=JanetPierre /&gt; [[Jean Calas]] suffered this torture before being [[Breaking wheel|broken on the wheel]] in 1762.&lt;ref name=Harvey2000 /&gt; The true case of the [[Madame de Brinvilliers|Marquise of Brinvilliers]] was reported in fiction by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] in "The Leather Funnel", by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]], in ''The Marquise de Brinvilliers''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1175/__P6.HTM ''The Marquise de Brinvilliers'' at Intratext]&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Émile Gaboriau]] in ''Intrigues of a Poisoner''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_BoCAAAAQAAJ ''Intrigues of a Poisoner'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
A form of water cure known as the [[Schwedentrunk|Swedish drink]] was used by various international troops against the German population during the [[Thirty Years' War]].

=== Spain ===
Water cure was among the forms of torture used by the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. The Inquisition at [[Málaga]] subjected the Scottish traveller [[William Lithgow (traveller and author)|William Lithgow]] to this torture, among other methods, in 1620. He described his ordeal in ''Rare Adventures and Painful Peregrinations'' (1632) :&lt;ref name=Hadfield2001 /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first and second [measures of water] I gladly received, such was the scorching drought of my tormenting pain, and likewise I had drunk none for three days before. But afterward, at the third charge, perceiving these measures of water to be inflicted upon me as tortures, O strangling tortures! I closed my lips, gainstanding that eager crudelity. Whereat the alcalde enraging, set my teeth asunder with a pair of iron cadges, detaining them there, at every several turn, both mainly and manually; whereupon my hunger-clunged belly waxing great, grew drum-like imbolstered: for it being a suffocating pain, in regard of my head hanging downward, and the water reingorging itself in my throat with a struggling force; it strangled and swallowed up my breath from yowling and groaning.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before pouring the water, torturers often inserted an iron prong (known as the ''bostezo'') into a victim's mouth to keep it open, as well as a strip of linen (known as the ''toca'') on which the victim would choke and suffocate while swallowing the water.&lt;ref name=HenryCharlesLea /&gt;

The water cure was among the forms of torture used by American soldiers on [[Philippines|Filipinos]] during the [[Philippine–American War]].&lt;ref name=MilleronTaft /&gt;&lt;ref name=Welch1973 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kramer2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SecretaryRoot /&gt; President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] privately assured a friend that the water cure was "an old Filipino method of mild torture. Nobody was seriously damaged whereas the Filipinos had inflicted incredible tortures on our people."&lt;ref name=Morison1902 /&gt; The president went further, stating, "Nevertheless, torture is not a thing that we can tolerate." However, a report at the time noted its lethality; "a soldier who was with [[Frederick Funston|General Funston]] had stated that he helped to administer the water cure to one hundred and sixty natives, all but twenty-six of whom died".&lt;ref name=SecretaryRoot /&gt; See the [[Lodge Committee]] for detailed testimony of the use of the water cure.

U.S. Army Major Edwin Glenn was suspended from command for one month and fined $50 for using the water cure in an incident which occurred on November 27, 1900. The Army judge advocate said the charges constituted "resort to torture with a view to extort a confession" and recommended disapproval because "the United States cannot afford to sanction the addition of torture".&lt;ref name=Kramer2008 /&gt;{{efn|A 2008 article on the [[National Public Radio]] website mistakenly asserted that this incident occurred during the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref name=npr /&gt; However, that war ended with the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] on December 10, 1898.}}

Lieutenant Grover Flint during the Philippine–American War:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A man is thrown down on his back and three or four men sit or stand on his arms and legs and hold him down; and either a gun barrel or a rifle barrel or a carbine barrel or a stick as big as a [[belaying pin]],{{spaced ndash}}that is, with an inch circumference,{{spaced ndash}}is simply thrust into his jaws and his jaws are thrust back, and, if possible, a wooden log or stone is put under his head or neck, so he can be held more firmly. In the case of very old men I have seen their teeth fall out,{{spaced ndash}}I mean when it was done a little roughly. He is simply held down and then water is poured onto his face down his throat and nose from a jar; and that is kept up until the man gives some sign or becomes unconscious. And, when he becomes unconscious, he is simply rolled aside and he is allowed to come to. In almost every case the men have been a little roughly handled. They were rolled aside rudely, so that water was expelled. A man suffers tremendously, there is no doubt about it. His sufferings must be that of a man who is drowning, but cannot drown.&lt;ref name=MilleronPhilippines /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his book ''The Forging of the American Empire'' [[Sidney Lens]] recounted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A reporter for the New York Evening Post (April 8, 1902) gave some harrowing details. The native, he said, is thrown on the ground, his arms and legs pinned down, and head partially raised "so as to make pouring in the water an easier matter". If the prisoner tries to keep his mouth closed, his nose is pinched to cut off the air and force him to open his mouth, or a bamboo stick is put in the opening. In this way water is steadily poured in, one, two, three, four, five gallons, until the body becomes "an object frightful to contemplate". In this condition, of course, speech is impossible, so the water is squeezed out of the victim, sometimes naturally, and sometimes{{spaced ndash}}as a young soldier with a smile told the correspondent{{spaced ndash}}"we jump on them to get it out quick." One or two such treatments and the prisoner either talks or dies.&lt;ref name=lens /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Police ====
The use of "[[third degree interrogation]]" techniques in order to compel confession, ranging from "psychological duress such as prolonged confinement to extreme violence and torture", was widespread in early American policing as late as the 1930s. Author Daniel G. Lassiter classified the water cure as "orchestrated physical abuse", and described the police technique as a "modern day variation of the method of water torture that was popular during the Middle Ages." The technique employed by the police involved either holding the head in water until almost drowning, or laying on the back and forcing water into the mouth or nostrils.&lt;ref name=Lassiter2004 /&gt;{{rp|47}} Such techniques were classified as "'covert' third degree torture" since they left no signs of physical abuse, and became popular after 1910 when the direct application of physical violence in order to force a confession became a media issue and some courts began to deny obviously compelled confessions.&lt;ref name=leo /&gt;{{rp|42}} The publication of this information in 1931 as part of the [[Wickersham Commission]]'s "Report on Lawlessness in Law Enforcement" led to a decline in the use of third degree police interrogation techniques in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name=leo /&gt;{{rp|38}}

=== Japan ===
During [[World War II]], water cure was among the forms of torture used by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] troops (especially the [[Kempeitai]]) in occupied territory. A report from the postwar [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] summarized it as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The so-called "water treatment" was commonly used. The victim was bound or otherwise secured in a prone position; and water was forced through his mouth and nostrils into his lungs and stomach until he lost consciousness. Pressure was then applied, sometimes by jumping upon his abdomen to force the water out. The usual practice was to revive the victim and successively repeat the process.&lt;ref name=IntMilTribunal /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Chase Nielsen|Chase J. Nielson]], who was captured in the [[Doolittle raid]], testified at the trial of his captors, "I was given several types of torture … I was given what they call the water cure" and it felt "more or less like I was drowning, just gasping between life and death."&lt;ref name=wp /&gt;

=== Philippines ===
The water cure has had a long history of use in during Philippines's colonial history, having been used during the Spanish, American, and Japanese occupations.  After Philippine Independence in 1945, the most notable instances of its use by the Philippine government was by the dictatorship of former President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].&lt;ref name="Marcelo2016"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/579676/torture-victims-tell-sc-of-tales-of-horror-under-marcos-martial-law/story/ |title=ORAL ARGUMENTS ON HERO’S BURIAL: Torture victims tell SC of tales of horror under Marcos’ Martial Law |last=Marcelo |first=Elisabeth |date=21 August 2016 |work=GMA News Online |access-date=2018-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229232303/http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/579676/torture-victims-tell-sc-of-tales-of-horror-under-marcos-martial-law/story/ |archive-date=2017-12-29 |dead-url=No |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCoy2007"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=xNpWEAg2B7UC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=maria+elena+ang+water&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0MUPG2oFlv&amp;sig=hUZep6MuqXET4cwVWPdNWgw2QKA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJvbW3sLbaAhVEnJQKHUlMB3YQ6AEwC3oECAAQWg#v=onepage&amp;q=maria%2520elena%2520ang%2520water&amp;f=false |title=A Question of Torture: CIA Interrogation, from the Cold War to the War on Terror |last=McCoy |first=Alfred |date=2007-04-01 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |isbn=9781429900683 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Marcos Regime ====
The water cure was one of the torture methods most used frequently by the [[History of the Philippines (1965–86)|Marcos Regime in the Philippines from 1965 to 1986,]] whose torturers referred to the practice as NAWASA sessions - a reference to the [[National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority]] which supplied water to the Metro Manila area at the time.&lt;ref name="Garcia2016"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q9zbCwAAQBAJ |title=Thirty Years Later&amp;nbsp;...
