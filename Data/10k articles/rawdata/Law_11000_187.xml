'''''A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States''''', 295 U.S. 495 (1935),&lt;ref name=Opinion&gt;{{ussc|name=A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States|295|495|1935}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] that invalidated regulations of the [[poultry]] industry according to the [[nondelegation doctrine]] and as an invalid use of Congress' power under the [[commerce clause]]. This was a unanimous decision that rendered the [[National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933]], a main component of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], unconstitutional.

==Facts==
{{more citations needed|date=May 2016}}
The regulations at issue were promulgated under the authority of the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA) of 1933.  These included [[price fixing|price]] and wage fixing, as well as requirements regarding the sale of whole chickens, including unhealthy ones. The government claimed the Schechters sold sick poultry, which has led to the case becoming known as "the sick chicken case".  Also encompassed in the decision were NIRA provisions regarding maximum work hours and a right of unions to organize. The ruling was one of a series which overturned elements of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] legislation between January 1935 and January 1936, until the Court's intolerance of economic regulations shifted with ''[[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish|volume=300|page=379|pin=|year=1937}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Industrial Recovery Act allowed local codes for trade to be written by private trade and industrial groups. The President could choose to give some codes the force of law. The Supreme Court's opposition to an active federal interference in the local economy caused Roosevelt to attempt to [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|pack the Court]] with judges that were in favor of the New Deal.

There were originally sixty charges against Schechter Poultry, which were reduced to eighteen charges plus charges of conspiracy by the time the case was heard by the U. S. Supreme Court.

Among the eighteen charges against Schechter Poultry were "the sale to a [[butcher]] of an unfit chicken" and the sale of two uninspected chickens.

Ten charges were for violating codes requiring "straight killing". Straight killing prohibited customers from selecting the chickens they wanted; instead a customer had to place his hand in the coop and select the first chicken that came to hand.  There was laughter during oral arguments when Justice Sutherland asked, "Well suppose however that all the chickens have gone over to one end of the coop?"&lt;ref&gt;Shlaes, Amity.  ''The Forgotten Man''.  New York: HarperCollins (2007), {{ISBN|978-0-06-621170-1}}, pp. 240–241.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Charles Evans Hughes|Hughes]] wrote for a unanimous Court in invalidating the industrial "codes of fair competition" which the [[National Industrial Recovery Act|NIRA]] enabled the [[President of the United States|President]] to issue.&lt;ref&gt;''Schechter Poultry Corp.'', 295 U.S. at 535, 551.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court held that the codes violated the [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] [[separation of powers]] as an impermissible delegation of [[legislative branch|legislative]] power to the [[executive branch]].  The Court also held that the NIRA provisions were in excess of [[United States Congress|congressional]] power under the [[Commerce Clause]].

The Court distinguished between direct effects on interstate commerce, which Congress could lawfully regulate, and indirect, which were  purely matters of state law.  Though the raising and sale of [[poultry]] was an interstate industry, the Court found that the "stream of interstate commerce" had stopped in this case—Schechter's slaughterhouses chickens were sold exclusively to intrastate buyers.&lt;ref&gt;In the 1960's, Prof. [[Harold Hyman]] told students in his Constitutional History course at U.C.L.A., "The Supreme Court was wrong!"  As a child he had worked for the Schechter brothers, and among other tasks, took chickens from Brooklyn to Jersey City--interstate commerce.&lt;/ref&gt;  Any interstate effect of Schechter was indirect, and therefore beyond federal reach.

Though many considered the NIRA a "dead statute" at this point in the New Deal scheme, the Court used its invalidation as an opportunity to affirm constitutional limits on congressional power, for fear that it could otherwise reach virtually anything that could be said to "affect" interstate commerce and intrude on many areas of legitimate state power.  The court ruled that the law violated the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]].  According to Supreme Court historian David P. Currie, the court believed that "to permit Congress to regulate the wages and hours in a tiny slaughterhouse because of remote effects on interstate commerce would leave nothing for the tenth amendment to reserve."  Currie added that "it can hardly have escaped the Justices that apart from its limitation to business there was little to distinguish what Congress had attempted from the 1933 legislation authorizing Adolf Hitler to govern Germany by decree ... the delegation decision in ''Schechter'' was a salutary reminder of the Framers' decision to vest legislative power in a representative assembly."&lt;ref&gt;Currie, David P.  ''The Constitution in the Supreme Court:  The Second Century, 1888–1986''.  Chicago and London:  The University of Chicago Press (1990), {{ISBN|0-226-13112-2}}, pp. 210, 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice [[Benjamin Cardozo|Cardozo's]] concurring opinion clarified that a spectrum approach to direct and indirect effects is preferable to a strict dichotomy.&lt;ref&gt;''Schechter Poultry Corp.'', 295 U.S. at 551-52 (Cardozo, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; Cardozo felt that in this case, Schechter was simply too small a player to be relevant to interstate commerce.

This traditional reading of the Commerce Clause was later disavowed by the Court, which after threats{{clarify|date=June 2017}} from Roosevelt began to read congressional power more expansively in this area, in cases such as ''[[NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.|NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.|volume=301|page=1|pin=|year=1937}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, more recent cases such as ''[[United States v. Lopez]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. Lopez|link=|volume=514|page=549|pin=|year=1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps signal a growing inclination in the Court to once again affirm limits on its scope.  In a unanimous 2011 decision, [[Bond v. United States (2011)|''Bond v. United States'']], the Supreme Court cited ''Schechter'' as a precedent.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Bond v. United States|link=Bond v. United States (2011)|volume=564|page=211|pin=|year=2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Speaking to aides of Roosevelt, Justice [[Louis Brandeis]] remarked that, “This is the end of this business of centralization, and I want you to go back and tell the president that we're not going to let this government centralize everything."&lt;ref&gt;Harry Hopkins, “Statement to Me by Thomas Corcoran Giving His Recollections of the Genesis of the Supreme Court Fight,” April 3, 1939, typescript in Harry Hopkins Papers&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hyde Park a few days after the decision, Roosevelt denounced the decision as an antiquated interpretation of the Commerce Clause.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaes, Amity.  ''The Forgotten Man''.  New York:  HarperCollins (2007), {{ISBN|978-0-06-621170-1}}, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the decision was announced, newspapers reported that 500 cases of NIRA code violations were going to be dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaes, Amity.  ''The Forgotten Man''.  New York:  HarperCollins (2007), {{ISBN|978-0-06-621170-1}}, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glen Asner, a descendant of the Schechters, said that the brothers probably voted for Roosevelt in all four of his presidential campaigns.  Their main political concern in the 1930s was anti-Semitism.  The Schechters felt that without the New Deal, America could have taken the route of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaes, Amity.  ''The Forgotten Man''.  New York:  HarperCollins (2007), {{ISBN|978-0-06-621170-1}}, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5194">The '''Bagley-Keene Act''' of 1967, officially known as the '''Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act''', implements a provision of the [[California Constitution]] which declares that "the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies shall be open to public scrutiny", and explicitly mandates open meetings for [[California]] State agencies, boards, and commissions. The act facilitates accountability and transparency of government activities and protects the rights of citizens to participate in State government deliberations.  Similarly, California's [[Brown Act]] of 1953 protects [[Civil rights|citizen rights]] with regard to open meetings at the county and local government level.

The act also reaffirms, "The people of this state do not yield their '''sovereignty''' to the agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created."

==Select provisions of Act==

Except as otherwise provided, State bodies shall provide an opportunity for members of the public to directly address the State body on each [[agenda (meeting)|agenda]] item before or during the state body's discussion or consideration of an item.  However, the Act allows a great many exceptions to this provision.

Notice of State body meetings shall be provided to any person who makes such a request in writing at least 10 days in advance.  Notices shall include a specific agenda for meetings, including the items of business to be transacted or discussed, and no item shall be added to the agenda subsequent to the notice.  Agendas of public meetings and other writings, when distributed to the members of a state body for discussion or consideration at a public meeting of such body, are public records under the [[California Public Records Act]].

State bodies may, however, take action on non-agendized items of business under certain circumstances, most notably upon a determination by a majority vote of the State body that an emergency situation exists.

Any person attending an open and public meeting of a State body shall have the right to record the proceedings on a tape recorder.

Each member of the state body shall be provided a copy of the Act upon his or her appointment to membership or assumption of office.

No State agency shall conduct any meeting or function in any facility prohibiting admittance to any person on the basis of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, or sex.

==Act's preamble==

Section 11120: It is the public policy of this state that public agencies exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business and the proceedings of public agencies be conducted openly so that the public may remain informed.  In enacting this article the Legislature finds and declares that it is the intent of the law that actions of state agencies be taken openly and that their deliberation be conducted openly.  The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them.  The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know.  The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created.  This article shall be known and may be cited as the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8190">A person who is accused of [[blasphemy]] in [[Yemen]] is often subject to vigilantism by governmental authorities. An accused person is subject to [[Sharia]], which, according to some interpretations, prescribes death for blasphemy.

==Yemen's legal system==
Yemen's constitution declares that Islam is the [[state religion]]. Non-Muslims are barred from holding elected office. Yemen’s legal system is a mixture of Islamic legal principles, old Egyptian laws, and Napoleonic codes. Islamic legal principles are applied in all courts—not just in Sharia courts.&lt;ref name="Carnegie"&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sharia==
Under Sharia, blasphemy is an instance of [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]]. Sharia says apostasy is a [[Hadd]] offence (an offence against God). In some jurisdictions, Sharia is understood to prescribe the [[death penalty]] for Hadd offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&amp;id=4FBA416ABC8805C2802569A600603109 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-07-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322025221/http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&amp;id=4FBA416ABC8805C2802569A600603109 |archive-date=2011-03-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Human rights==
Information about blasphemy in Yemen is difficult to obtain because government authorities severely restrict the freedom of the press. Human rights abuses are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://report2009.amnesty.org/en/regions/middle-east-north-africa/yemen |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715001043/http://report2009.amnesty.org/en/regions/middle-east-north-africa/yemen |archivedate=2009-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Democracy as blasphemy==
The Salafi movement in Yemen is a redoubtable force against blasphemy. The movement has more than 120 centers and more than 700 mosques. The movement condemns as blasphemous all actions that promote democracy, and calls those who participate in such actions ''atheists'' and ''sinners''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Selected cases==
In 2008, Yemeni authorities arrested Firass Al-Yafi'ee, a journalist who had been an irritant to the government since the late 1990s, on charges of drinking alcohol and committing blasphemy. During Al-Yafi'ee's trial, a [[fatwa]] appeared. The fatwa accused Al-Yafi'ee of insulting the Quran, and called for his death. Judge Anwar Al-Sayed convicted Al-Yafi'ee on one charge: drinking alcohol, and sentenced him to receive eighty [[lashes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2000, [[Abdul Karim Al-Razihi]] fled to the Netherlands because of the campaign waged against him by Salafyoon mosques, Aden. The mosques accused al-Razihi of atheism and infidelity because of his poem titled "A Summer Night Dream." The mosques claimed that al-Razihi blamed angels and acquitted Satan where the poem states, "A Satan sees me and an angel seduced me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Another Intellectual Seeks Asylum |work=20, Vol X |publisher=Yemen Times |date=May 15 thru May 21, 2000 |url=http://www.yementimes.com/00/iss20/ln.htm |accessdate=1 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021112204848/http://www.yementimes.com/00/iss20/ln.htm |archivedate=November 12, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, zealots orchestrated a campaign against Samir al-Yusuf for reprinting one of the classics of modern Yemeni literature, ''Sana: An Open City'' by Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wali (1940–73). The zealots accused al-Yusuf of disseminating blasphemy.&lt;ref name="NLR"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3904">[[Image:DEAgenealogy.png|thumb|350px|right|The Bureau of Narcotic and Dangerous Drugs directly preceded the Drug Enforcement Administration.]]
The '''Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs''' ('''BNDD''') was a bureau within the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) and a predecessor agency of the modern [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA).

==History==
It was created by § 3 of the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1968, submitted to Congress on {{date|February 7, 1968}} and effective {{date|April 8, 1968}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{USFR|33|5611}}, {{USStat|82|1367}} at 1368&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed as a subsidiary of the [[United States Department of Justice]], combining the [[Bureau of Narcotics]] (from the [[United States Department of the Treasury]]) and [[Bureau of Drug Abuse Control]] (from the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]]'s [[Food and Drug Administration]]) into one agency.

In 1973, the BNDD was merged into the newly formed [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA).

==Activities==
In 1971, the BNDD was composed of 1,500 agents and had a budget of some $43 million (which was more than fourteen times the size of the budget of the former Bureau of Narcotics).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/aof/aof11.html The Narcotics Business:John Ingersoll's Version]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1971 the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) director, [[Richard Helms]], approved a program of "covert recruitment and security clearance support to BNDD", on request of the BNDD director, John Ingersoll.&lt;ref name=GWU29&gt;

===CIA Involvement===
What was also suspected and has been confirmed is the [[CIA]] was actually running [[covert operations]] via BNDD&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sott.net/article/301758-Feeding-the-drug-business-How-the-CIA-commandeered-the-Drug-Enforcement-Agency the [[CIA]] was actually running [[covert operations]] via BNDD]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Speyer (DerHexer) 2010-12-19 051.jpg|thumb|The [[Napoleonic code]]]]
A '''civil code''' is a [[code (law)|systematic collection of laws]] designed to deal with the core areas of [[private law]] such as for dealing with business and negligence lawsuits and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/civil+code |title=civil code legal definition |work=the Free Online Law Dictionary |publisher=Legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A jurisdiction that has a civil code generally also has a [[code of civil procedure]]. In some jurisdictions with a civil code, a number of the core areas of private law that would otherwise typically be codified in a civil code may instead be codified in a [[commercial code (law)|commercial code]].

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}

The concept of [[Codification (law)|codification]] dates back to ancient [[Babylon]]. The earliest surviving civil code is the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]], in . 2100–2050 BC. The [[Corpus Juris Civilis]], a codification of [[Roman law]] produced between 529-534 AD by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian I]], forms the basis of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal systems.

Other codified laws used since ancient times include various texts used in [[religious law]]s, such as the [[Manu Smriti|Law of Manu]] in [[Hindu law]], the [[Mishnah]] in Jewish [[Halakha]] law, the [[Canons of the Apostles]] in Christian [[Canon law]], and the [[Qur'an and Sunnah]] in Islamic [[Sharia]] law to some extent.

===European codes and influences on other continents===
[[File:Swiss civil code 1907.jpg|thumb|The first edition of the [[Swiss Civil Code]] (around 1907). In 1911, it became the first civil code to include commercial law ([[Swiss Code of Obligations]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Frédéric Koller, [https://www.letemps.ch/monde/2016/09/13/suisse-inspire-modernisation-droit-chinois "Quand la Suisse inspire la modernisation du droit chinois"], ''[[Le temps]]'', Tuesday 13 September 2016 (page visited on 14 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The idea of codification re-emerged during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], when it was believed that all spheres of life could be dealt with in a conclusive system based on human [[rationality]], following from the experience of the early codifications of [[Roman Law]] during the [[Roman Empire]].

The first attempts at modern codification were made in the second half of the 18th century in [[Germany]], when the states of [[Austria]], [[Prussia]], [[Bavaria]] and [[Saxony]] began to codify their laws. The first statute that used this denomination was the ''[[Codex Maximilianeus bavaricus civilis]]'' of 1756 in Bavaria, still using the Latin language. It was followed in 1792 by a legal compilation that included civil, penal, and constitutional law, the ''[[General state laws for the Prussian states|Allgemeines Landrecht für die Preussischen Staaten]]'' (General National Law for the Prussian States) promulgated by King [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II the Great]]. In Austria, the first step towards fully-fledged codification were the yet incomplete [[Codex Theresianus]] (compiled between 1753 and 1766), the [[Josephinian Code]] (1787) and the complete [[West Galician Code]] (enacted as a test in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] in 1797). The final [[Austrian Civil Code]] (called ''Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch'', ABGB) was only completed in 1811 after the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] under the influence of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. One of the very first countries to follow up through [[legal transplants]] in codification was [[Serbia]], the [[Serbian civil law|Serbian Civil Code]] (1844).

Meanwhile, the [[France|French]] [[Napoleonic code]] (''Code Civil'') was enacted in 1804 after only a few years of preparation, but it was a child of the [[French Revolution]], which is strongly reflected by its content. The French code was the most influential one because it was introduced in many countries standing under French occupation during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In particular, countries such as [[Italy]], the [[Benelux]] countries, [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] (with the Civil Code of 1867, later replaced by the Civil Code of 1966, which is strongly influenced by the German BGB), the [[Latin America]]n countries, the province of [[Quebec]] in [[Canada]], the state of [[Louisiana]] in the [[United States]], and all other former French colonies which base their civil law systems to a strong extent on the Napoleonic Code.

The late 19th century and the beginning 20th century saw the emergence of the School of [[Pandects|Pandectism]], whose work peaked in the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German Civil Code]] (BGB), which was enacted in 1900 in the course of Germany's national unification project, and in the [[Swiss Civil Code]] (''Zivilgesetzbuch'') of 1907. Those two codes had been most advanced in their systematic structure and classification from fundamental and general principles to specific areas of law (e.g. contract law, labour law, inheritance law). While the French Civil Code was structured in a "casuistic" approach attempting to regulate every possible case, the German BGB and the later Swiss ZGB applied a more abstract and systematic approach. Therefore, the BGB had a great deal of influence on later codification projects in countries as diverse as [[Japan]], [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], Portugal (1966 Civil Code) and [[Macau]] (1999 Civil Code).

Since 2002 with the First law of the Civil Code of Catalonia, Parliament of Catalonia's several laws have approved the successive books of the [[Civil Code of Catalonia]]. This has replaced most of the Compilation of the Civil Law of Catalonia, several special laws and two partial codes. Only the Sixth book, relating to obligations and contracts, has to be approved.

In Europe, apart from the [[common law]] countries of the United Kingdom and Ireland, only [[Scandinavia]] remained untouched by the codification movement. The particular tradition of the civil code originally enacted in a country is often thought to have a lasting influence on the methodology employed in legal interpretation. Scholars of [[comparative law]] and economists promoting the [[legal origins theory]] of (financial) development usually subdivide the countries of the [[civil law tradition]] as belonging either to the French, Scandinavian or German group (the latter including Germany, Austria, [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]], Japan, [[Taiwan]] and [[South Korea]]).

===Civil codes in the Americas===
The first civil code promulgated in [[Canada]] was that of [[New Brunswick]] of 1804, inspired by the 1800 project of the French civil code, known as the ''Projet de l'an VIII'' (project of the 8th year); nevertheless, in 1808 a ''Digeste de la loi civile'' was sanctioned.

In the [[United States]], codification appears to be widespread at a first glance, but U.S. legal codes are actually collections of common law rules and a variety of ''ad hoc'' statutes; that is, they do not aspire to complete logical coherence. For example, the [[California Civil Code]] largely codifies common law doctrine and is very different in form and content from all other civil codes.

In 1825, [[Haiti]] promulgated a ''Code Civil'', that was simply a copy of the Napoleonic one; while [[Louisiana]] abolished its ''Digeste'', replacing it with the ''Code Civil de l'État de la Louisiane'' the same year.

The [[Mexican state]] of [[Oaxaca]] promulgated the first Latin American civil code in 1827, copying the French civil code.

Later on, in 1830, the civil code of [[Bolivia]], a summarized copy of the French one, was promulgated by [[Andrés de Santa Cruz]]. The latest, with some changes, was adopted by [[Costa Rica]] in 1841.

The [[Dominican Republic]], in 1845, put into force the original Napoleonic code, in French language (a translation in Spanish was published in 1884).

In 1852, [[Peru]] promulgated its own civil code (based on a project of 1847), which was not a simple copy or imitation of the French one, but presented a more original text based on the Castillan law (of [[Roman Law|Roman]] origin) that was previously in force on the Peruvian territory.

[[Chile]] promulgated its [[Civil Code (Chile)|civil code]] in 1855, an original work in confront with the French code both for the scheme and for the contents (similar to the Castillan law in force in that territory) that was written by [[Andrés Bello]] (begun in 1833). This code was integrally adopted by [[Ecuador]] in 1858; [[El Salvador]] in 1859; [[Venezuela]] in 1862 (only during that year); [[Nicaragua]] in 1867; [[Honduras]] in 1880 (until 1899, and again since 1906); [[Colombia]] in 1887; and [[Panama]] (after its separation from Colombia in 1903).

In 1865, the Code Civil du Bas-Canada (or [[Civil Code of Lower Canada]]) was  promulgated in [[Lower Canada]] (later the [[Canadian province]] of [[Quebec]]). It was replaced in 1991 by a new [[Civil Code of Quebec]], which came into effect in 1994.

[[Uruguay]] promulgated its code in 1868, and [[Argentina]] in 1869 (work by [[Dalmacio Vélez Sársfield]]). [[Paraguay]] adopted its code in 1987, and in 1877 [[Guatemala]] adopted the Peruvian code of 1852.

[[Nicaragua]] in 1904 replaced its civil code of 1867 by adopting the Argentine code. In 1916 [[Brazil]] enacted its civil code (project of [[Clovis Bevilacqua]], after rejecting the project by [[Teixeira de Freitas]] that was translated by the Argentines to prepare their project), that entered into effect in 1917 (in 2002, the Brazilian Civil Code was replaced by a new text).  Brazilian Civil Code of 1916 was considered, by many, as the last code of the 19th century despite being adopted in the 20th century.  The reason behind that is that the Brazilian Code of 1916 was the last of the important codes from the era of codifications in the world that had strong liberal influences, and all other codes enacted thereafter were deeply influenced by the social ideals that emerged after World War I and the Soviet Socialist Revolution.

[[Panama]] in 1916 decided to adopt the Argentine code, replacing its code of 1903.

[[Cuba]] had the old Civil Code of Spain until the year 1987 when the [[National Assembly of People's Power]] approved the Cuban Civil Code, Law 59.

===Civil codes in Asia===
The Portuguese Civil Code of 1868 was introduced in the Portuguese overseas territories of Asia ([[Portuguese India]], [[Macau]] and [[Portuguese Timor]]) from 1870, with local modifications being latter introduced. It continued to be in effect in the former Portuguese India even after the end of the Portuguese rule in 1961. It is still in force in the present Indian territories of [[Goa]] (locally referred as the [[Goa civil code]]), [[Daman and Diu]] and [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]]. As Macau and Portuguese Timor were still under Portuguese rule when the Portuguese Civil Code of 1868 was replaced by that of 1966, this later was adopted by these territories. In [[East Timor]] (ex-Portuguese Timor), the Portuguese Code was replaced by the Indonesian Code when Indonesia occupied that territory in 1975. Macau adopted its own Civil Code in 1999, although this being based in the Portuguese Code of 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1280595 Macau Civil Code]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Also the civil code of Spain of 1889 would be enforced in its [[colony]], the [[Philippines]], and this would remain in effect even after the end of [[History of the Philippines#Spanish rule (1565–1898)|Spanish rule]] until the [[Philippines]] enacted its own [[Civil Code of the Philippines|Civil Code]] in 1950 after almost fifty years of U.S. rule.

Many legal systems of other countries in Asia are within the civil law tradition and have enacted a civil code, mostly derived from the German civil code; that is the case of [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Thailand]] (the Civil and Commercial Code), [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] and [[Indonesia]] (which is influenced by the Dutch Civil Code, {{lang|nl|Burgerlijke Wetboek}}).

==Contents of a civil code==
A typical civil code deals with the fields of law known to the common lawyer as [[contracts|law of contracts]], [[law of torts|torts]], [[property|property law]], [[family law]] and the law of [[inheritance]]. [[Commercial law]], [[corporate law]] and [[civil procedure]] are usually codified separately.

The older civil codes such as the French, Egyptian, Austrian and Spanish ones are structured under the [[Institutions System|Institutional System]] of the [[Roman empire|Roman]] jurist [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] and generally have three large parts:
* [[Law of Persons]] (''personae'')
* [[Law of Things]] (''res'')
* Issues common to both parts (''actiones'').

The newer codes such as the ones of Germany, Switzerland, Greece, Portugal, Romania and Catalonia are structured according to the [[Pandects|Pandectist System]]:
* General part
* [[Law of Obligation]]
* [[Law of Real Rights]]
* [[Family law|Family Law]]
* [[Law of Inheritance]]

The civil code of the state of [[Louisiana]], following the institutions system, is divided into five parts:
* Preliminary Title
* Of Persons
* Things and Different Modifications of Ownership
* Of Different Modes of Acquiring the Ownership of Things
* Conflict of Laws

Pandectism also had an influence on the earlier codes and their interpretation. For example, Austrian civil law is typically taught according to the Pandect System (which was devised by German scholars in the time between the enactment of the Austrian and the German Codes), even though this is not consistent with the structure of the Code.

[[Image:E8086-Bishkek-glass-bottle-collection-point.jpg|thumb|Refillable glass bottles collected, and deposits refunded, at a collection point in [[Bishkek]], [[Kyrgyzstan]]. Deposit values (from 50 tyiyn to 2 [[Kyrgyz som]], i.e. 2–5 U.S. cents) for various bottle types are posted next to the sample bottles on a rack.]]

'''Container-deposit legislation''' (also known as a '''deposit-refund system''', '''bottle bill''', or '''deposit-return system''') is any law that requires the collection of a monetary deposit on beverage containers (refillable or non-refillable) at the point of sale.  When the container is returned to an authorized redemption center, or retailer in some jurisdictions, the deposit is partly or fully refunded to the redeemer (presumed to be the original purchaser). It is a [[deposit-refund system]].

Governments may pass container deposit legislation for several reasons, including, for example:
* To encourage recycling and complement existing curbside recycling programs, to reduce energy and material usage for containers
* To specifically reduce beverage container [[litter]] along [[highway]]s, in lakes and rivers, and on other public or private properties (where beverage container litter occurs, a nominal deposit provides an economic incentive to clean it up; this is a significant source of [[income]] to some poor individuals and [[non-profit]] civic organizations)
* To extend the usable lifetime of taxpayer-funded landfills

Deposits that are not redeemed are often kept by distributors or bottlers to cover the costs of the system (including handling fees paid to retailers or redemption enters to collect, sort, and handle the containers) or are escheated to the governmental entity involved to fund environmental programs. 

==History==
A &amp; R Thwaites &amp; Co in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], announced in 1799 the provision of artificial "[[soda water]]" and that they paid 2 shillings a dozen for returned bottles. [[Schweppes]] that also was in the business of artificially made [[mineral water]]s, had a similar recycling policy about 1800, without any legislation.&lt;ref name="britishsoftdrinks.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishsoftdrinks.com/PDF/history.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014013216/http://www.britishsoftdrinks.com/PDF/history.pdf |archivedate=October 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish bottled beverage companies also voluntarily introduced such a scheme to encourage the return of their bottles for reuse.[https://web.archive.org/web/20140426202005/http://www.agbarr.co.uk/ces_general.nsf/wpg/about_us-frequently_asked_questions.html] In Sweden a standard system for deposits on bottles and recycling was established in 1884, eventually by law. The popular demand for a deposit on [[aluminium can]]s to reduce littering led to legislation in 1984.

In North America, [[British Columbia]]'s legislated deposit-return system, enacted in 1970, is the oldest such program in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bottlebill.org/legislation/canada/britishcolumbia.htm|title=BottleBill.org - The British Columbia Deposit Law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Container-deposit legislation by country==

===Australia===

[[File:Reverse vending machine for the NSW Container Deposit Scheme at the Kooringal Mall 2.jpg|thumb|Reverse container vending machine in [[Kooringal, New South Wales]]]]
In the days when bottles were washed and re-used, drinks manufacturers paid for the return of their (proprietary) containers, but with the advent of [[disposable|single-use]] containers great savings were possible, leaving their disposal as the consumer's responsibility.

While a national scheme has been repeatedly delayed largely due to unveiled threats from the beverage industry of multimillion-dollar ad campaigns against politicians who support it and disagreements between the states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/millions-of-dollars-in-attack-ads-coming-in-march-20141024-11b5pi.html|title=Millions of dollars in attack ads coming in March|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been a growing momentum of state-based operated container deposit schemes (CDS). Currently all states except Victoria and Tasmania look to have some sort of state-based container deposit scheme operating within the next 2 years. With 8 billion beverage containers landfilled or littered every year in Australia, proponents argue that it is the most effective method to reduce such litter; and improve recycling above that achieved by kerbside. It also has many co-benefits such as funds for charities and several thousand new jobs, that cannot be achieved by other approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boomerangalliance.org.au|title=Boomerang Alliance|work=Boomerang Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The state of [[South Australia]] charges a refundable deposit of AUD 10 [[Australian dollar|cents]] per drinks carton, can or bottle (only containers marked as eligible for refund; does not include wine &amp; spirits bottles, milk cartons, or concentrated/and or vegetable juice intended to be diluted before consumption). This has been in place since 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.sa.gov.au/environmental_info/container_deposit|title=Request Rejected|website=www.epa.sa.gov.au|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall return rate is 79.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Container deposits|url=http://www.epa.sa.gov.au/environmental_info/container_deposit|website=Environment Protection Authority|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Northern Territory]] introduced a container deposit scheme in 2012.  A 10-cent (AUD) refundable deposit is charged on all beverage containers with the exception of unflavoured milk, soy milk, cordial bottles (undiluted), concentrated fruit/vegetable juice intended to be diluted before consumption, and still or sparkling wine (in glass bottles). Unredeemed deposits remain with the producer/filler. In 2015-2016, the system achieved a total return rate of 54%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Annual Report 2015-16|journal=Environment Protection (Beverage Containers and Plastic Bags) Act|url=https://ntepa.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/387987/2015-16-CDS-Annual-Report.pdf|publisher=Northern Territory Environment Protection Authority|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The state of [[New South Wales]] (the most populated state, with 7.5 million residents) recently announced that it would be adopting a 10-cent (AUD) deposit scheme, which commenced on December 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSW CDS|url=http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/waste/cds-intro.htm|website=NSW Environment &amp; Heritage|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is expected to double the state's beverage container recycling rate to roughly 80 percent. 
* On July 22, 2016, the [[Queensland]] government announced that the state would introduce a container deposit scheme. The government has confirmed that the initiative will start in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2016/7/22/container-deposit-scheme-for-queensland|title=Container deposit scheme for Queensland|website=qld.gov.au|publisher=Queensland government|language=en-AU|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the scheme, it is expected that a 10-cent (AUD) refund will be provided for empty drink containers between 150ml and 3L. 
* The state of [[Western Australia]] has announced the start date of a state-based scheme commencing in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-17/10-cent-container-deposit-scheme-for-wa-recyclable-bottles-cans/7751328|title=Premier Colin Barnett announces 2018 start date for cash for containers scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme will apply to certain empty drink containers ranging in size from 150ml to 3L and will exclude domestically consumed drink containers such as wine and spirit bottles, milk and juice containers. The amount of the deposit/refund will be AUD 10-cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Programs - Department of Water and Environmental Regulation|url=https://www.der.wa.gov.au/our-work/programs/111-wa-container-deposit-scheme|website=Department of Water and Environmental Regulation|publisher=Government of Western Australia|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=en-au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belgium ===
Smaller beer bottles (250 or 330&amp;nbsp;mL) carry a [[Euro|€]]0.10 deposit, and larger ones (750&amp;nbsp;mL or 1&amp;nbsp;L) a €0.20 one. Some fruit-juice bottles, such as those sold by Oxfam Wereldwinkels/Magasins du Monde], carry a €0.30 deposit. Some hard plastic milk bottles such as those sold by [[Delhaize Group|Delhaize]] carry a €0.20 deposit.

===Canada===
{{See also|Recycling in Canada}}In 1970, British Columbia became the first Canadian province to establish a mandatory deposit-return system for soft drinks and beer containers. Today, nearly all provinces and territories in Canada have followed suit; the territory of Nunavut is the only jurisdiction in Canada that has yet to implement some sort of deposit refund system. 

Deposits range from CAD$0.05 to CAD$0.40 per unit depending on the material and size of the container and whether the container contains an alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage. 

Below is a brief summary of each program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmconsultinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/WPW2016-FINAL-with-cover.pdf|title=Who Pays What 2016|last=CM Consulting|first=|date=2016|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
* British Columbia: While the original program covered only carbonated soft drinks and beer, the deposit legislation expanded to include any ready-to-serve beverage sold in a container that is sealed by its manufacturer (e.g. bottled water, juice, new age drinks, and alcohol), excluding milk and milk substitutes. There are currently two stewardship agencies in BC that carry out deposit-refund obligations on behalf of beverage producers: [[Encorp Pacific]] (for non-alcoholic beverages, wine, spirits, some ciders and coolers, and some import beer) and Brewers Distributor Ltd. (BDL) (for domestic coolers, beers, and ciders). In 2017, BC's program recovered over 1 billion containers for an overall return-rate of 75.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.return-it.ca/ar2017/executive-summary.php|title=Encorp Pacific Executive Summary 2017|access-date=2 October 2018|publisher=[[Encorp Pacific]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alberta: All beverage containers ([[glass bottle]]s, [[Beverage can|metal cans]], [[Tetra Pak]]s, gable-top cartons, bags-in-boxes, [[plastic bottle]]s and jugs, drink pouches), including milk containers (Alberta was the first jurisdiction in North America to accept and charge a deposit on milk containers in June 2009), are charged deposits at the point of sale; 10¢ for containers 1 L or less, and 25¢ for containers larger than 1 L. Containers can be dropped off at depots and are picked up by the Alberta Beverage Container Recycling Corporation. In 2014, over 2 billion beverage containers were returned to Alberta depots for an overall return rate of 83%. 
* Saskatchewan: Established in 1988, Saskatchewan's deposit-return program applies to all ready-to-serve beverage containers, except those for meal replacements, or dietary supplements. SARCAN began taking milk and milk substitutes on April 1, 2017. SARCAN Recycling is responsible for administering the program and operates under contract to the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment. In fiscal 2014-2015, a total of 405.6 million beverage containers were returned to SARCAN recycling depots for an overall container return rate of 87%. 
* Manitoba: Manitoba's program was implemented in 2010 and is limited to beer containers, which are charged a deposit of CAD$0.10 or $0.20 depending on the size. Other containers (except milk) are charged a non-refundable $0.02 per unit levy (Container Recycling Fee) and can be recycled in municipal curbside recycling programs.
* Ontario: The Ontario Deposit Return Program (ODRP), which came into force in February 2007, is a voluntary program implemented by the provincial government that covers wine, spirits, and imported beer containers (plastics, metal, bimetal, glass, gable top, Tetra Pak, bag-in-box containers). Because there is no law mandating that wine and spirits be placed on deposit, they may be added to municipal blue box programs voluntarily. Refillable and non-refillable beer containers are collected through a separate program administered and operated by Brewers Retail Inc. (The Beer Store). Alcoholic beverage containers, as well as any associated packaging, can be returned to 443 beer store locations, 113 breweries (beer containers only), 141 retail partner stores, 63 LCBO northern agency stores, 4 additional LCBO stores, and 115 empty bottle dealers (small independent depots contracted in more remote locations where beer retailers are not available), for a total of 879 redemption locations. TBS trucks collect these empty containers and back-haul them to various distribution centres where recyclables are sent to a processing facility for sorting, baling, and shipping to market. Refillable bottles are sent back to the brewers for washing and refill. Containers returned through Ontario's deposit-return system showed a total recycling rate of 89% for 2014-2015, while refillable beer bottles were returned at a rate of 98%.

* Quebec: Quebec's deposit-return system was established in 1984 and covers beer and carbonated soft drink containers. Deposits range from CAD$0.05¢ to $0.20 depending on the size, material and content of the container. Boissons Gazeuses Environnement (BGE) administers the program for non-refillable soft-drink containers on behalf of industry, while Recyc-Quebec oversees the beer container collection program. In 2014, the recycling rate for containers recovered via the deposit-return system was 78% (includes data for refillable bottles). 
* New Brunswick: This program was created in 1992 and covers all ready-to-drink, non-refillable beverage containers 5L and under, including soft-drinks, beer, wine, spirits, flavoured waters, fruit juices, vegetable juices, and low alcohol drinks. Containers for milk and milk products (and substitutes) as well as processed apple cider are exempt. Encorp Atlantic Inc. is the stewardship agency responsible for managing the collection, transportation, and partial processing of non-alcoholic beverage containers on behalf of brand-owners, and New Brunswick Liquor (NB Liquor) is responsible for the collection of alcoholic beverage containers. Program oversight is the responsibility of the Department of Environment. New Brunswick's deposit-return program is somewhat unique in that it operates under a “half-back” model where only half of the original deposit is refunded to the consumer when a container is returned for recycling. The unrefunded portion of the deposit is used to cover the costs of administering the program and part of it also goes towards the province's Environmental Trust Fund, which is used for environmental conservation and other provincial initiatives aimed at reducing waste. In 2014, New Brunswick's recycling rate for non-refillable containers was 73%.
* Nova Scotia: Launched on April 1, 1996, Nova Scotia's deposit-return program applies to all ready-to-drink beverage containers excluding milk, milk products, soya milk, and rice beverages. Other containers that are exempt from the program are certain meal replacements, formulated liquid diets, foods for very low energy diets, thickened juices, baby formulas, concentrates, and non-alcoholic beverages in containers of 5L or more. The organization responsible for managing the program is DivertNS (formerly the Resource Recovery Fund Board Inc.). Like New Brunswick's program, Nova Scotia's deposit-return system is based on a “half-back” model where only half of the original deposit paid per container is refunded to the consumer. The non-refundable portion of the deposit is used as revenue by DivertNS to help pay for program costs. In 2014, the program collected 334 million non-refillable beverage containers for a recycling rate of 84%. 
* Prince Edward Island: The province's deposit-return system was launched on May 3, 2008 as a replacement to a law that had prohibited the sale of non-refillable soft drink containers. The program is overseen and administered by the Department of Environment, Energy, and Forestry and covers all ready-to-drink beverage containers up to 5L, except those used for dairy products, milk substitutes, or nutritional supplements. Similar to the other Atlantic provinces, PEI's deposit-return system is based on a “half-back” model where only 50% of the original deposit paid is refunded to the consumer when he/she returns the empty container to a depot. In 2014-2015, PEI had a non-refillable beverage container recycling rate of 80% and a total container recycling rate of 82%. 
* Yukon: Introduced in 1992, Yukon's deposit-return program covers all ready-to-drink beverage containers (glass, plastic, steel, aluminum, and Tetra Pak), excluding those containing milk and milk substitutes. The program is managed by the Department of Community Services and requires consumers to pay a surcharge on the purchase of certain beverage containers, which includes a refundable deposit and a non-refundable recycling fund fee (RFF). Upon return of the empty container to a depot or processor, a portion of the surcharge (the refundable deposit) is refunded to the consumer, while the non-refundable RFF is kept by the retailer and remitted to the territorial Recycling Fund, where unredeemed deposits also go. In 2014, Yukon had a non-refillable recycling rate of 82%. In May 2016, the Yukon government announced changes to the Beverage Container Regulation. These changes, which are expected to be implemented August 1, 2017, will affect the surcharges and refunds applicable to beverage containers including milk and milk substitutes, and will simplify the regulation. Once the territory's new regulations kick in, all beverage containers will fall into two categories: (1) 750ml and less, including all milk &amp; milk substitutes (surcharge 10-cents, refund 5-cents), and (2) 750ml and more (surcharge 35-cents, refund 25-cents). 
* Northwest Territories: Launched on November 1, 2005, Northwest Territories’ deposit-return program covers all ready-to-serve beverage containers made of glass, plastics, aluminum, bi-metal, and mixed materials, including juice, milk and liquid milk products (added February 2010), soda, water, beer, wine, liquor and other alcoholic beverages. Excluded from the program are containers for infant formula; containers for milk and liquid milk products smaller than 30ml; and powder milk. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DNR) is responsible for administering the program. Similar to Yukon's program, the total surcharge per container includes a refundable deposit and a non-refundable handling fee. Whereas the refundable deposit is returned to the consumer when they return the beverage container to a depot, the non-refundable handing fee is put into the Environment Fund and is used to help cover program costs. In fiscal 2014, approximately 26 million beverage containers were returned for reuse or recycling, translating into an overall recycling rate of 89%.

=== Croatia ===
Since 2006, a refundable deposit of 0.5 HRK (Croatian Kuna) has been levied on non-refillable containers (except dairy products) with minimum volume of 200ml. Retailers over 200m2 are obliged to take-back containers. Collection is mostly manual, although some collection occurs with reverse vending machines. Retailers must sort containers by material type (PET bottles, aluminum/steel cans, and glass bottles). The scheme is government operated and there is a collection target of 95%. In 2015, the scheme recovered up to 90% of all non-refillable containers placed on the Croatian market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmconsultinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BOOK-Deposit-Global-24May2017-for-Website.pdf|title=Deposit Systems for One-Way Beverage Containers: Global Overview (2016)|last=Reloop Platform &amp; CM Consulting|first=|date=2016|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Czech Republic ===
In the [[Czech Republic]] most beer is sold in returnable glass bottles that carry a CZK 3 deposit. These bottles are collected by shops and supermarkets. Reverse vending machines have mostly replaced human staff. There is also a CZK 100 deposit on plastic beer crates with a 20 bottle capacity. Most reverse vending machines accept an entire crate full of empty bottles, returning CZK 160. There is no deposit on other containers.

===Denmark===
&lt;!--[[Image:DK_PantC.jpg|thumb|right|Deposit type C in Denmark]]--&gt;
In [[Denmark]] the selling of aluminium beverage cans was forbidden between 1982 and 2002. However this regulation violated [[European Union law]]. Therefore, the [[European Union|EU]] forced Denmark to replace it, and the new legislation, passed in 2002, introduced a container deposit scheme. The law covers beer (alcohol content &gt;0.5% by volume), carbonated soft drinks (alcohol content 0-0.5%), energy drinks, mineral water, iced tea, ready-to-drink beverages, and mixer products (alcohol content 0.5%-10%). Excluded from the scheme are fruit squash, juice, cocoa, wine and spirits, and milk. The deposit levels are as follows&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.danskretursystem.dk/en/all-about-deposits/deposit-amounts/|title=Deposit Amounts in Denmark|last=Dansk Retur System|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 
* Disposable aluminium and glass containers under 1L and refillable glass bottles  under 0.5L: 1DKK 
* Disposable and refillable plastic containers under 1L: 1.5DKK
* Metal and plastic containers equal to or greater than 1L or refillable glass bottles over 0.5L: 3DKK
The deposit system operator is [[Dansk Retursystem]] A/S, a private non-profit organization. Most collection (95%) is done automatically using reverse vending machines, but some (5%) is done manually. In 2014, the system achieved a total return rate of 89%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmconsultinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BOOK-Deposit-Global-24May2017-for-Website.pdf|title=Deposit Systems for One-Way Beverage Containers|last=Reloop Platform &amp; CM Consulting|first=|date=2016|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Estonia ===
&lt;!--[[Image:PfandEstlandB.jpg|thumb|right|Deposit symbol in Estonia ("B" on a 1.5&amp;nbsp;L-bottle)]]--&gt;
In [[Estonia]] there is a universal deposit and recycling system since 2005 for one-time and refillable containers. This includes soft drinks, water, beer, cider, juice, juice concentrates, nectars, and low-ethanol alcoholic beverages (up to 6% volume). It does not include strong alcoholic beverages such as wine or vodka, glass jars, or Tetra Paks. The deposit is €0.10 on all metal, plastic, and glass beverage containers of all sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eestipandipakend.ee/en/how-does-the-deposit-system-work/|title=How does the deposit system work?|last=Eesti Pandipakend OU|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is operated by Eesti Pandipakend OÜ, which is a producer responsibility organization representing the Estonian Association of Brewers, the Association of Producers of Soft Drinks, the Association of Importers of Soft Drinks and Beer, and the Estonian Retailers Association.

In 2015, 90% of all PET bottles, 70% of all aluminum cans and 87% of all glass bottles sold in Estonia were returned for recycling and/or reuse. The overall return rate was 82.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmconsultinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BOOK-Deposit-Global-24May2017-for-Website.pdf|title=Deposit Systems for One-Way Beverage Containers: Global Overview|last=Reloop Platform &amp; CM Consulting|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Fiji===
The United Nations Development Programme had funded a feasibility study to look at the possibility of establishing a deposit-return system in Fiji, building on the experience gained from their successful projects in Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uncrd.or.jp/content/documents/RT4_01_Fiji.pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Fijian Government approved the Environment Management [Waste Disposal and Recycling][Amendment] Regulations 2011, and the Environment Management [Container Deposit] Regulations 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.abc.us.org/index.php/apjee/article/download/724/pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regulations provide the legal framework for the introduction of a container deposit and refund system, allowing beverage producers and importers to adjust pricing and accommodate deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fijisun.com.fj/2011/09/29/cabinet-approves-waste-management-laws/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regulations will also allow the Department of Environment to register and establish the Managing Agency that will administer Fiji's container deposit system, and establish a revolving fund account to receive all deposits paid by producers for all beverages sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fbc.com.fj/fiji/174/cabinet-approves-amendments-to-laws|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No further details are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4943:cabinet-approves-environment-management-waste-disposal-and-recycling-amendment-regulations-2011&amp;catid=49:cabinet-releases&amp;Itemid=166 |title=Cabinet Approves Environment Management (Waste Disposal And Recycling) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 |date=29 September 2011 |publisher=Fijian Government |accessdate=2 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311150347/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4943%3Acabinet-approves-environment-management-waste-disposal-and-recycling-amendment-regulations-2011&amp;catid=49%3Acabinet-releases&amp;Itemid=166 |archivedate=11 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
Deposits were introduced on aluminum cans in 1996, on PET bottles in 2008, and on glass bottles in 2012. Almost all soft drinks are covered by the program, in addition to water, beer, cider, long drinks, sport drinks, juice, and liquor/spirits/wine sold by Alko. Milk is exempt. The system is administered by Suomen palautuspakkaus Oy (abbr. Palpa), which is a private consortium of beverage importers and manufacturers. In 2016, aluminum cans were recovered at a rate of 96%, PET bottles 92%, and one-way glass 88%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.palpa.fi/news/horeca/return-rates-of-palpa-s-deposit-packages-in-2016/?Nav=ajankohtaista&amp;type=Return+rates+of+Palpa%27s+deposit+packages+in+2016|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deposit values for these containers are as follows&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmconsultinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BOOK-Deposit-Global-24May2017-for-Website.pdf|title=Deposit Systems for One-Way Beverage Containers: Global Overview (2016)|last=Reloop Platform &amp; CM Consulting|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 

* Plastic &lt;0.5L: [[Euro|€]]0.10 
* Plastic 0.5L-1L: €0.20
* Plastic &gt;1L: €0.40
* Metal: €0.15
* Glass: €0.10

The scheme is, in technical sense, voluntary and Palpa does not hold a legal monopoly for container deposits systems. However, it is the only such system in operation. Those beverage containers that do not belong to a container deposit system are levied an excise tax of €0.51/L, regardless of the container size.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2004/20041037 Laki eräiden juomapakkausten valmisteverosta (1037/2004)].

===Germany===
[[Image:Aldi-Pfandrückgabeautomat.JPG|thumb|[[Reverse vending machine]] in an [[Aldi]] supermarket in Germany.]]
In [[Germany]] container deposit legislation, known as ''Einwegpfand'' (single-use deposit), was passed in 2002, and was implemented on 1 January 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccr-clearing.de/en/about-deposit-clearing|title=About deposit clearing: The German deposit system|last=|first=|date=|website=CCR Clearing Reverse Logistics Group|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its implementation was fought by [[lobby group]]s of German bottling industry and [[retailer]]s. This fight also included [[Trial (law)|trials]] at the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany]] and the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]], but all trials were won by the German federal government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rk20021227_1bvr235102a.html "Ruling of the Constitutional Court of Germany"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928194845/http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rk20021227_1bvr235102a.html |date=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deposit legislation covers plastic, aluminum, and glass containers for water, beer, mixed drinks containing beer, carbonated/non-carbonated soft drinks, and mixed alcoholic drinks. Excluded from the program are containers for fruit and vegetable juice, milk products, wine, spirits, liquors, and certain dietary drinks. Also excluded are containers smaller than 100mL and larger than 3L. At any given time, an estimated 2&amp;nbsp;billion [[beer bottle]]s are in circulation in Germany, each of which sees an average of 36 reuses.&lt;ref name=DieWelt&gt;{{cite news |last=Gassmann |first=Michael |date=April 9, 2014 |title=Der Wahnsinn, wenn Sie in München Flens trinken |url=https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article126732784/Der-Wahnsinn-wenn-Sie-in-Muenchen-Flens-trinken.html |newspaper=[[Die Welt]] |language=de |trans-title=The Madness of drinking Flens in Munich |access-date=October 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2016, the standard deposit for all single-use containers (cans, single-use glass and plastic bottles) 0.1L-3L in volume is [[Euro|€]]0.25. Retailers are only obliged to take back the material fractions that they sell. 

The deposit for refillable bottles is not defined by law. The usual rates are locally €0.02 for some wine bottles, €0.08 for beer bottles up to 0.5&amp;nbsp;L, and €0.15 for beer bottles with [[flip-top]] closures, beer bottles over 0.5&amp;nbsp;L and other bottles (mostly water and soft-drinks, lesser fruit drinks, milk, cream, yoghurt). Some bottles have an even higher deposit. [[Bottle crate]]s have a deposit of €1.50. Shops only accept bottles of sold vendors and sizes.
[[File:German plastic bottle with sign .jpg|thumb|German bottle with sign ]]
Germany's collection system is 80% automated and 20% manual. Most supermarkets in Germany have a [[reverse vending machine]] that is designed to be used by customers and which scans "Pfand" returns and prints a receipt for the total value of the refund which can be exchanged for cash or put towards the cost of future purchases. 

Supermarkets near the Danish border have established a scheme, where Scandinavian residents are exempt from "Pfand", by signing an "Export declaration" and providing that cans are exported within 24 hours and the contents are not consumed within Germany.

===Hungary===
In [[Hungary]], [[beer]], [[wine]] and standardized [[liquor]] bottles carry a deposit on them, which was liberalized in the recent past. Beer bottles have 25&amp;nbsp;[[Hungarian Forint|forints]] on them, but for wine glasses and for liquor bottles, the sum is decided by the trader, which people can exploit by buying a drink in a certain retailer and bringing the bottle back to its rival who have a bigger deposit on it. PET bottles and metal beverage containers are taken back only by some super- and [[hypermarkets]], such as [[Lidl]], [[Auchan]], [[Tesco]], [[Spar (retailer)|Interspar]]. They all use [[reverse vending machine]]s to collect them: for bottles and in most places for the PET bottles they use a Wincor-Nixdorf or a Tomra machine, while [[beverage can|ALU cans]] are collected by the Hungarian ALU-press machine. Its advantage is that it accepts flattened or pressed cans as well, and it crushes them with a pressing machine, thus improving the storage capacity of the machine. The containers' prices - 2&amp;nbsp;forints/ALU can and 1&amp;nbsp;forint/PET bottle - do not widely motivate people to revend these containers.

===Iceland===
[[Iceland]] has had a deposit system on a national scale for a wide range of containers (plastic, aluminum, and glass) since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://endurvinnslan.is/english/|title=Endurvinnslan - English|author=Nethönnun ehf.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All ready-to-drink beverages, wine, and liquor are included in the program. Milk, milk products, and juice extracts are excluded. The deposit is the same for all bottles and cans, [[Icelandic Krona|ISK]] 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endurvinnslan.is/english/|title=Deposit System|last=Endurvinnslan hf. (Recycling Ltd)|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The recycling rate per product is approximately 90% aluminum, 87% PET, and 83% glass.

===Israel===
In Israel, there is a 0.30-[[Israeli new shekel|shekel&amp;nbsp;(₪)]] deposit on beverage containers over 100ml and under 5L, except for dairy products. The system is operated by the ELA Recycling Corporation, a private non-profit organization owned by Israel's beverage manufacturers. Businesses are required to accept bottles if they sold them, or if they are over 28 square meters and sell beverages from the same manufacturer or importer. Businesses are not required to accept more than 50 bottles per customer per day. The deposit was initially ₪0.25, but was raised shortly after the ₪0.05 coin was discontinued.

In 2015, the system achieved a total return rate of 77%.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Most 500&amp;nbsp;mL beer bottles (local brands such as Goldstar and Maccabee plus certain imported ones like Carlsberg and Tuborg) have a deposit of ₪1.20, and are willingly accepted even by smaller businesses (plastic water bottles, glass wine bottles and soda cans are mostly accepted by larger supermarket chains, some of which possess [[reverse vending machines]]).

===Japan===
The container deposit legislation, as a monetary approach to the garbage/recycling problem, has never caught on in [[Japan]]. However, under increasingly ever stricter sorting rules announced by each town or city, garbage is meticuously sorted into kitchen garbage, newspapers/books, metal cans (washed)/plastic bottles (rinsed), garden weeds, etc. in each neighborhood for pickkup by collection cars, usually on different days notified by the local government. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jpninfo.com/9826|title=A Guide to Trash and Garbage Disposal in Japan – Japan Info|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Lithuania===

Lithuania implemented container deposit legislation for single-use cans and bottles in February 2016. Lithuania's program is comprehensive and charges a deposit on nearly all types of beverage containers, including those made of plastic, metal, and glass 0.1L to 3L. The deposit is applicable to beer and beer cocktails; cider and other fermented beverages; mixed alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages; all types of water; juice and nectars (sold in glass, plastic, and metal packaging); and fruit wines and wine-product cocktails sold in plastic and metal packaging. Milk, wine, and spirits are exempt. The deposit is the same for all containers and is €0.10 per bottle/can, and most collection is done using reverse vending machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grazintiverta.lt/en/for-business/about-the-system/#|title=Deposit|last=Užstato Sistemos Administratorius|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lithuania's deposit return system is operated by Užstato Sistemos Administratorius (USAD). Container return rates for plastic bottles were 34% before the deposit scheme, 74.3% at end of 2016, 91.9% at end of 2017, and 93% in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/recycling-lithuania-deposit-system-exceeds-all-expectations/45003/|title=Recycling: Lithuania deposit system exceeds all expectations|website=Open Access Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.foodbev.com/news/vending-in-reverse-the-industry-is-leading-on-returnable-plastics/|title=Vending in reverse: the industry is leading on returnable plastics|website=Foodbev Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
{{See also|Recycling in the Netherlands}}
Under the current deposit-return scheme, large [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET) bottles greater than 0.5L are subject to a [[Euro|€]]0.25 deposit, but only those for soft drinks and water. All other beverage types, such as medical drinks, wine, spirits, etc., are excluded. The system, which is operated by Stichting Retourverpakkingen NL, is mostly automated collection (89%) with only 11% of returns being done manually.  Beer bottles carry a €0.10 deposit, and beer crates €1.50.

In 2014, the Netherlands' deposit system recovered 95% of the containers covered by the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmconsultinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BOOK-Deposit-Global-24May2017-for-Website.pdf|title=Deposit Systems for One-Way Beverage Containers: Global Overview (2016)|last=Reloop Platform &amp; CM Consulting|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
[[New Zealand]] had no container-deposit legislation until 2008 when the [[Waste Minimisation Act 2008]] passed into law. The Act has provision for [[product stewardship]] of which container-deposit legislation is the most familiar type. {{As of|2010}} there is no widespread deposits available on containers with some beer bottles being a notable exception.

===Norway===
[[Image:Container deposit machine.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Tomra]] reverse vending machine in [[Hammerfest]], Norway]]
Automated recycling of bottles has been in use since the 1970s. Aluminum and steel beverage cans had a 5,60 kr surtax in [[Norway]] up until the end of the 20th century. In 1999, a container deposit legislation was passed, which also abolished this regulation. Today, these are the following container deposits in Norway:
* Cans, glass and plastic bottles up to 0.5&amp;nbsp;L: 2.00&amp;nbsp;[[Norwegian krone|krone]]
* Cans, glass and plastic bottles over 0.5&amp;nbsp;L: 3&amp;nbsp;kr
* Bottle crates are also reverse vended.

In 2018 the rates were increased to 2 NOK (formerly 1 NOK) and 3 NOK (previously 2.50 NOK) due to inflation and the discontinuation of the 50-øre coin.

[http://infinitum.no Infinitum AS] (formerly Norsk Resirk A/S) is responsible for operating the national recycling scheme for non-refillable plastic bottles and beverage cans in Norway. The non-profit corporation was founded in 1999 and is owned by companies and organizations in the beverage industry and food trading. 

The Norwegian system works in such a way that the excise tax decreases as the returns increases, meaning that for example that 90 per cent returns for cans translates into a 90 per cent discount on the excise tax. This again allows drink products to be sold at lower prices.

In 2014, 95.4% of PET bottles and 96.6% of all drink cans in Norway were returned under the scheme. 

Deposits on drink containers have a long history in Norway, starting with deposits on beer bottles in 1902. The deposit back then was 0.06 kr (3.30 kr in 2006 currency value).
This deposit arrangement was later expanded to include soft drink bottles.

Up until 1 January 2001, the [[Vinmonopolet]] government wine and spirits monopoly chain had deposits on products made by the company itself, this did not include imported products.

All sellers of deposit marked drinking containers are required by law to accept returns of empty containers for cash. As of 2016, drink containers can be returned and deposits retrieved at over 15,000 establishments in Norway. The collection system is 95% automated (using reverse vending machines) and only 5% manual. Most reverse vending machines in Norway are manufactured by [[Tomra|Tomra Systems ASA]].

===Sweden===
[[Image:Pant 50 öre.jpg|thumb|200px|Deposit symbol of the old Swedish 50&amp;nbsp;öre 33-cl [[aluminium]] can.]]
In [[Sweden]], there are deposits on nearly all ready-to-serve beverages, including beer, soft drinks, cider, and bottled water. Dairy products, vegetable juice, fruit juice, and berry drinks are excluded from the program. The deposit values are as follows: 
* Metal: [[Swedish Krona|SEK]] 1
* Plastic &lt; 1l: SEK 1
* Plastic &gt; 1l: SEK 2
* Glass 33 cl: SEK 0,60, an empty red bottle crate for 20 bottles have a SEK 22,40 deposit. 
* Glass 50 cl: SEK 0,90, an empty blue bottle crate for 15 bottles have a SEK 28,00 deposit. 
AB Svenska Returpack ([http://pantamera.nu/om-oss/returpack-in-english/ Pantamera]) is responsible for the deposit system for aluminium cans and PET bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fakta om Returpack |publisher=AB Svenska Returpack |url=http://www.returpack.se/flash.php?pageId=106 |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830063036/http://www.returpack.se/flash.php?pageId=106 |archivedate=2009-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aluminum cans have had a deposit since 1984, and PET bottles since 1994.

Until 1998, the hard alcohol and wine bottles sold at [[Systembolaget]] — the government owned alcohol retail monopoly — had a deposit as well, but due to the deregulation of the Systembolaget's suppliers, the former sole supplier [[V&amp;S Group]] dropped the deposit on their bottles due to the restricted bottle shapes giving V&amp;S a disadvantage compared to the competitors. The bottles could be returned and deposit refunded until early 1999 at Systembolaget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sista chansen att panta vin- och spritflaskor|publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/telegram/0,1082,1269668_INR_p_,00.html|date=1999-02-21|accessdate=2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation regarding container deposit systems was updated so that from January 1, 2006, containers from other plastics and metals, e.g., steel cans, can be included in the deposit systems.&lt;ref name="sr-steelcans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.returpack.se/download/pdf/bakgrundsfakta.pdf|title=Fakta om Returpack|publisher=AB Svenska Returpack|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919154813/http://www.returpack.se/download/pdf/bakgrundsfakta.pdf|archivedate=September 19, 2007|accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Svensk författningssamling SFS 2005:220 |publisher=[[Parliament of Sweden]] |url=http://62.95.69.3/SFSdoc/05/050220.PDF |date=2005-04-14 |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011824/http://62.95.69.3/SFSdoc/05/050220.PDF |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law also makes it illegal in Sweden to sell consumption-ready beverages in containers that are not part of an authorized Swedish container deposit system, with the exception of beverages that mainly consist of dairy products or vegetable, fruit, or berry juice. However, private importation from (mainly Eastern European) countries without deposit occurs by vendors that thus compete with a somewhat lower customer price. The recycling of these contraband cans has not been seen as a problem, but Returpack made a campaign in 2010 offering 0.10 [[Swedish krona|krona]] for each imported can (without deposit) to the benefit of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], retrieving 17 million cans. In 2011, a similar campaign was repeated, retrieving almost 18 million cans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.returpack.se|title=Välkommen till Pantamera|work=Pantamera}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Non-deposit glass containers are collected in large glass garbage bins, for clear or coloured glass, placed centrally in most urban areas.

The 1.5&amp;nbsp;L refillable PET bottle with a deposit of 4.00&amp;nbsp;kr has been discontinued, and has been replaced by the 1.5&amp;nbsp;L non-refillable PET bottle. The last day for returning bottles made by [[Spendrups]] for deposit was 30 June 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Viktig information angående 4:- pant för hårda retur-PET flaskor Sverige |publisher=Sveriges Bryggerier |date=July 2007 |url=http://www.sverigesbryggerier.se/pressrum/enskilda-nyheter-2007/0707-pressmed%20pant%20for%20harda%20retur-pet.pdf |format=PDF |language=Swedish |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320014134/http://www.sverigesbryggerier.se/pressrum/enskilda-nyheter-2007/0707-pressmed%20pant%20for%20harda%20retur-pet.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the last day for bottles made by [[Coca-Cola]] Sweden was 30 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pant upphör 30 juni 2008 |publisher=Sveriges Bryggerier |url=http://www.sverigesbryggerier.se/emballage/pant%204%20kr.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423223055/http://www.sverigesbryggerier.se/emballage/pant%204%20kr.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2008-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Sweden is one of the leading countries in recycling of beverage containters, Returpack uses TV commercials to promote more recycling. Commercials have been made with well-known melodies sung, like "[[Guantanamera]]" and "Pata pata"—sounding like Returpack's slogan "panta mera" (i.e., "recycle more").

In 2016, the overal recycling rate was 84.9% for both aluminum cans and PET bottles, which translates to 177 packages per person in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pantamera.nu/om-oss/returpack-in-english/about-returpack/|title=About Returpack|last=Pantamera|first=|date=|website=|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
In [[Switzerland]], there is a government ruling that 75% of containers must be returned, otherwise a deposit system may be introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/814_621/index.html|title=SR 814.621 Verordnung vom 5. Juli 2000 über Getränkeverpackungen (VGV)|author=Bundeskanzlei - P|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
Until the turn of the 21st century, most British bottled beer was sold (whether in off-licences or pubs) in standard quart, pint, half-pint or third-pint (nip) [[beer bottle|bottles]], although some brewers preferred their own distinctive designs. The standard deposit was 7[[Penny (British decimal coin)|pence (p)]] for a pint bottle and 5p for a half-pint. However, in the absence of legislation, and given the switch from pub to supermarket sales, and from Imperial to metric measures, the industry has now entirely abandoned refillable bottles.

Beer casks sold for the home or party consumption of draught beer are usually also loaned out against a deposit which may run to several tens of pounds.

====England ====

In England, in January 2017, ministers were reported to be considering a 10p or 20p refundable deposit on plastic bottles and containers after Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas had voiced her support of such a scheme at the end of 2016. As of February 2017, the idea of a plastic bottle levy was unlikely as the government rejected the deposit scheme proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ciwm-journal.co.uk/deposit-return-scheme-plastic-bottles-unlikely/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, the UK government announced plans to introduce a deposit return scheme in England for drinks containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-43563164|title=Drinks bottles and can deposit return scheme proposed|work=BBC News|date=28 March 2018|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Ireland ====

As of June 2015, Northern Ireland had been considering a drinks deposit scheme, following the publication of a feasibility study for a deposit return scheme for drinks containers in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ciwm-journal.co.uk/northern-ireland-considers-drinks-deposit-scheme/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has yet to implement such a scheme.

==== Scotland ====

In Scotland, some Barr products in 750&amp;nbsp;mL glass bottles, had a 30p container deposit although this was discontinued in August 2015. Some Tesco stores have reverse vending machines which pay ½p per aluminium can (equivalent value in Tesco Clubcard Points). Furthermore, the landmark Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 passed by the Scottish Parliament contains within it powers for Scottish ministers to implement a national scheme.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2009/12/part/5/crossheading/deposit-and-return{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2017, a Holyrood motion supporting the idea of a small deposit on all drinks containers was signed by 66 MSPs, including member from every party. In May 2015, the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland (APRS) published Scottish polling which revealed overwhelming support for deposit-return. The figures showed that 78.8% of those who expressed a view supported this approach for Scotland, while just 8.5% opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haveyougotthebottle.org.uk/campaign-news/new-campaign-launched-deposit-return-system-scotland/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several companies, most notably large drinks corporations like Coca-Cola, are known to have lobbied against the introduction of a national deposit scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theferret.scot/industry-battle-block-drinks-deposit/|title=Industry’s battle to block drinks deposit scheme|date=3 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/15/plastic-bottle-tax-unlikely-government-rejects-deposit-scheme/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaked documents&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4157956/Coca-Cola-plot-kill-bottle-deposits.html|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; reveal that in Europe, Coca Cola had identified deposit programs as a threat and they were planning to fight back. But in February 2017, the drinks company unexpectedly announced its support for a deposit-return program in Scotland, and in a statement to the Independent, Coca-Cola UK stated: "We have embarked on a major review of our sustainable packaging strategy to understand what role we can play in unlocking the full potential of a circular economy in Great Britain."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/coca-cola-recycling-scotland-scottish-drinks-bottle-return-scheme-u-turn-a7592971.html|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 5, 2017, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that a deposit-system would be implemented as a means to tackle the rising tide of waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/nicola-sturgeon-announces-can-and-bottle-deposit-return-scheme-1-4551671|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No date has been set for implementation at this time. In the days of refillable milk bottles, such bottles were deposit-free.

====Wales====
As of March 2018, Welsh ministers are working on a plan to introduce a deposit return scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-43567768|title=Bottle deposit scheme: Welsh ministers 'already working' on plan|date=28 March 2018|accessdate=28 March 2018|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main article|Container deposit legislation in the United States}}
The [[United States]] container-deposit laws are popularly called "bottle bills" after the [[Oregon Bottle Bill]], which was the first U.S. state to pass container deposit legislation in 1971.

Efforts to pass container deposit legislation in the 39 states that do not have them are often politically contentious.  The U.S. beverage container industry—including both the bottlers of water, soda, [[beer]], and the [[Corporation|corporate]] owners of grocery stores and convenience stores—often spends large amounts of money lobbying against the introduction of both new and amended beverage container deposit legislation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Because of this, a new bottle bill has not been passed since 2005, and Delaware repealed its law in 2010 in favour of a non-refundable USD $0.04 tax per beverage container sold (Universal Recycling Law).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bottlebill.org/news/articles/2010/DE-5-17-DEReplacesBottleDeposits.htm|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delaware's bottle bill was introduced in 1982 and had charged a $0.05 deposit on all beverage container (except aluminum) under 2 quarts. 

There are currently 10 states that have container deposit laws: 
* California: Enacted in 1981 and operated by CalRecycle, California's bottle bill charges a USD$0.05 refundable deposit on containers less than 24 fl. oz, and USD$0.10 for containers 24 fl. oz or greater.  The deposit is applicable to plastic, aluminum, bimetal, and glass containers, including beer, malt, wine and distilled spirits, and all non-alcoholic beverages. Milk, 100% fruit juice ≥46 oz., vegetable juice ≥16 oz, and refillables are excluded. The total return rate in 2015 was 81%.

The program now includes beer, malt, carbonated soft drinks, and noncarbonated beverages in plastic, metal, or glass containers &lt;3L. Juices and HDPE containers are exempt from the deposit. The deposit is the same for all container types and is USD$0.05. In 2015, the total return rate was 50% (does not include 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; quarter). Before water bottles were added to the deposit system, redemption rates were higher (65-70% range). 
* Hawaii: Hawaii's bottle bill has been in place since 2005 and is government-operated. A refundable deposit of USD$0.05 is charged on all plastic (PET, HDPE), metal, bi-metal, and glass beverage containers 2L or less, except for milk and dairy products. In 2015, the system achieved a total return rate of 68%
* Iowa: Introduced in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Evan (June 9, 1985). "Handling Called Messy: Iowa Cleaner; Bottle Law Praised". ''Omaha World-Herald'' (Omaha, Nebraska).&lt;/ref&gt; Iowa's bottle bill covers beer, carbonated soft drinks, mineral water, wine coolers, wine and liquor. All types of containers are accepted, including sealed glass, plastic, or metal bottles, can, jars or cartons. Fruit and vegetable juices, fruit drinks, and milk and milk products are exempt. The deposit is uniform across beverage categories and is currently USD$0.05. It is estimated that the return rate is around 86%.
* Maine: Established in 1978 after a [[ballot initiative]],&lt;ref&gt;Merry, George B. (January 27, 1981). "New 'bottle bills' face crucial test in months ahead". ''The Christian Science Monitor''. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Maine's bottle bill charges a USD$0.05 deposit on plastic, metal, and glass containers and USD$0.015 for most liquor and wine bottles. All beverages in containers 4L or less are included, with the exception of dairy products and unprocessed cider. According to testimony provided by a beverage industry lobbyist to the state, the 2015 return rate was 90%. 
* Massachusetts: The state's bottle bill was effective as of January 17, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Merry, George B. (November 18, 1981). "Bay State places 'nickel-and-dime' bounty on all beverage containers". ''The Christian Science Monitor''. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It applies to beer, malt, carbonated soft drinks, and mineral water in plastic, metal, bimetal, or glass containers (or any combination of those materials). The deposit levied is USD$0.05. In 2015, 57% of beverage containers covered by the bottle bill were returned for a refund of the deposit.
* Michigan: Implemented in 1978, Michigan's bottle bill charges a USD$0.10 deposit on plastic, metal, glass, and paper containers less than 1 gallon. The types of beverages included in the bill include beer/ale, soft drinks, carbonated and mineral water, wine coolers, canned cocktails, and malt drinks. Milk, juice, tea, sport drinks, and foil pouches are excluded.  In 2014, the total return rate was 94%.

September 17, 1983. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; New York charges a USD$0.05 deposit on plastic, metal, and glass containers 3.78L or less. The deposit is applicable to carbonated soft drinks, soda water, energy drinks, juices (anything &lt;100% juice), beer and other malt beverages, mineral water, wine products, water that does not contain sugar, including flavored or nutritionally enhanced water. Excluded from the program are milk products, wine and liquors, tea, sports drinks, juice that is not 100%, drink boxes, and water containing sugar. In 2015, the system achieved a return rate of 65%. 
* Oregon: Oregon's bottle bill, introduced in 1972, is the oldest in the U.S. It covers plastic, metal, and glass beverage containers containing water/flavoured water, beer/malt, soda water, mineral water, teas, juice, and carbonated soft drinks 3L or less. Wine and liquor, as well as milk and milk substitutes are excluded from the program. Up until April 2017, the deposit has been USD$0.05 per container. It is now $0.10 per container. In 2014, Oregon's bottle bill had a 68% return rate. This is expected to increase as a result of the increase in the deposit level. 
* Vermont: Implemented in 1973, Vermont's bottle bill charges a USD$0.05 deposit on plastic, metal, and glass beer, wine coolers and other malt beverages, soft drinks and other carbonated beverage containers. Most liquor and spirits bottles are charged a deposit of USD$0.15.

{{CrimLaw}}
In [[criminal law]], '''corporate liability''' determines the extent to which a [[corporation]] as a [[legal person]] can be liable for the acts and [[omission (criminal law)|omissions]] of the [[natural person]]s it employs. It is sometimes regarded as an aspect of criminal [[vicarious liability (criminal)|vicarious liability]], as distinct from the situation in which the wording of a [[statutory]] offence specifically attaches liability to the corporation as the principal or joint principal with a human agent.

==The concepts==
The imposition of criminal liability is only one means of regulating corporations. There are also [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] [[remedy (law)|remedies]] such as [[injunction]] and the award of [[damages]] which may include a penal element. Generally, criminal sanctions include [[imprisonment]], fines and community service orders. A company has no physical existence, so it can only act vicariously through the agency of the human beings it employs. While it is relatively uncontroversial that human beings may commit crimes for which [[punishment]] is a just desert, the extent to which the corporation should incur liability is less clear. Obviously, a [[company (law)|company]] cannot be sent to [[Prison|jail]], and if a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] is to be paid, this diminishes both the money available to pay the [[wage]]s and [[salary|salaries]] of all the remaining employees, and the [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] available to pay all the existing [[shareholder]]s. Thus, the effect of the only available punishment is deflected from the wrongdoer personally and distributed among all the innocent parties who supply the [[labour (economics)|labour]] and the [[Capital (economics)|capital]] that keep the corporation [[solvency|solvent]].

Because, at a [[public policy (law)|public policy]] level, the growth and prosperity of [[society]] depends on the business [[community]], [[government]]s recognise limits on the extent to which each permitted form of [[business entity]] can be held liable (including [[general partnership|general]] and [[limited partnership]]s which may also have separate legal personalities).  However, limitations on corporate liability can lead to profound injustices for individuals resulting from a limited ability to be properly compensated for wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carlson|first=Margaret|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-13/hot-coffee-cold-cash-and-the-tort-reform-con-margaret-carlson.html|accessdate=9 August 2013|work=Bloomberg|title=Hot Coffee, Cold Cash and Torts: Margaret Carlson|date=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal or civil controls?==
===Using the criminal law===
*Represents formal public disapproval and condemnation because of the failure to abide by the generally accepted social norms, codified into the criminal law. [[Police]] powers to investigate can be more effective, but the availability of relevant expertise may be limited. If successful,  [[prosecution]] reinforces social values and shows the state's willingness to uphold those values in a [[trial (law)|trial]] likely to attract more publicity when previously respected business leaders are called to account. The [[Legal judgment|judgment]] may also cause a loss of corporate reputation and, in turn, a loss of profitability.
*Justifies more severe penalties because it is necessary to overcome the higher [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] to establish criminal liability. But the high burden means that it is more difficult to secure a judgment than in the civil courts, and many corporations are cash-rich and so can pay apparently immense fines without difficulty. Further, if the corporation knows that the fine is going to be severe, it may seek bankruptcy protection before [[sentence (law)|sentencing]].
*The theoretical value of punishment is that the offender feels shame, guilt or remorse, emotional responses to a conviction that a fictitious person cannot feel.
*If a state turns too often to the criminal law, it discourages self-regulation and may cause friction between any regulatory agencies and businesses that they are to regulate.

===Using the civil law===
*With the lower burden of proof and better case management tools, civil liability is easier to prove than criminal liability, and offers more flexible remedies which can be preventative as well as punitive.
*But there is little [[morality|moral]] condemnation and no real deterrent effect so the general management response may be to see civil actions as a routine [[cost of business]] which is tax deductible.

==Criminal laws==
Most [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s use criminal and civil systems in parallel, making the political judgment on how infrequently to use the criminal law to maximise the publicity of those cases that are prosecuted. While others enact specific [[legislation]] covering [[health and safety]], and product safety issues which lay down general protections for the public and for the [[employee]]s. The difficulty of proving a ''mens rea'' is avoided in the less serious offences by imposing absolute, [[strict liability]], or vicarious liability which does not require proof that the accused knew or could reasonably have known that its act was wrong, and which does not recognise any [[excuse]] of honest and reasonable [[mistake (criminal law)|mistake]]. But, most [[legislature]]s require some element of [[culpability|fault]], either by way of an [[intention (criminal law)|intention]] to commit the offence or [[recklessness (law)|recklessness]] resulting in the offence,  or some [[knowledge]] of the relevant circumstances. Thus, companies are held liable when the acts and omissions, and the knowledge of the employees can be [[imputation (law)|attributed]] to the corporation. This is usually filtered through an ''identification'', ''[[directing mind]]'' or ''alter ego'' test which proves that the employee has sufficient status to be considered the company when acting.

===Identification test in English law===
In ''[[Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass]]'' [1972] AC 153, Lord Reid said:
:The person who acts is not speaking or acting for the company. He is acting as the company and his mind which directs his acts is the mind of the company. If it is a guilty mind then that guilt is the guilt of the company.

This approach has been criticised because it restricts corporate liability to the acts of directors and a few high-level managers. This unfairly favours larger corporations because they will escape criminal liability for the acts of all the employees who manage the day-to-day activities of the corporations. This has proved problematic as in the cases involving [[corporate manslaughter]].

===Aggregation test in the United States===
By “aggregating” the acts and omissions of two or more natural persons acting as the corporation, the ''actus reus'' and ''mens rea'' can be constructed out of the conduct and knowledge of several individuals. This is termed the ''Doctrine of Collective Knowledge''. In ''United States v Bank of New England'' (1987) 821 F2d 844 the charge of wilfully failing to file reports relating to currency transactions was proved because the bank’s knowledge was the totality of what all of the employees knew within the scope of their authority. The Court of Appeals’ confirmed a collective knowledge is appropriate because corporations would compartmentalise knowledge and subdivide duties and avoid liability. Aggregation has been applied in Australian courts, but is rejected in England.&lt;ref name=Capuano&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1586331 Capuano A, 'Catching the Leprechaun: Company Liability and the Case for a Benefit Test in Organic Attribution', (2010) Vol 24 No 2 Australian Journal of Corporate Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

===A blameworthiness test===
Gobert argues that if a corporation fails to take precautions or to show due diligence to avoid committing a criminal offence, this will arise from its [[corporate culture|culture]] where attitudes and beliefs are demonstrated through its structures, policies, practices, and procedures. This rejects the notion that corporations should be treated in the same way as natural persons (i.e. looking for a "guilty" mind), and advocates that different legal concepts should underpin the liability of fictitious persons. This reflects the structures of modern corporations which are more often decentralised and where crime is less to do with the misconduct by or incompetence of individuals, and more to do with systems that fail to address problems of monitoring and controlling risk.

===Benefit test=== 
A benefit test has been applied in the Federal Court of Australia, the House of Lords (now the Supreme Court of England)    {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} and the Supreme Court of Canada. Put simply, the test proposes that where a company gains the benefit of an act, it is considered to be attributed with that act. The test is applied differently when an act is performed by a "mind and will", which usually prompts the use of the organic theory, as opposed to an agent which usually prompts the use of the [[principal–agent problem|agency theory]].&lt;ref name=Capuano /&gt;

==Specific issues==
===Fraud===
In some instances of [[fraud]], the [[court]] may [[piercing the corporate veil|pierce the veil of incorporation]]. Most fraud is also a breach of the criminal law and any [[evidence (law)|evidence]] obtained for the purposes of a criminal [[trial (law)|trial]] is usually admissible in civil proceedings. But criminal prosecutions take priority, so if civil proceedings uncover evidence of criminality, the civil action may be stayed pending the outcome of any criminal investigation.

===Secondary liability===
Some crimes are considered [[inchoate offense|inchoate]] because, like a [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] or [[attempt]], they anticipate the commission of the ''[[actus reus]]'' (the [[Latin]] for "guilty act") of the full offence. One option for [[prosecution]] would be to treat a corporation as an [[accomplice]] or co-conspirator with the employees. In general terms, most states permit companies to incur liability for such offences in the same way as natural persons so long as there are at least two natural persons involved in the conspiracy and one other accomplice to aid the commission of the offence by a principal.

{{distinguish|counsel}}
A '''council''' is a group of people who come together to consult, deliberate, or make decisions. A council may function as a [[legislature]], especially at a [[town]], [[city]] or [[county]]/[[shire]] level, but most legislative bodies at the state or national level are not considered councils. At such levels, there may be no separate [[executive branch]], and the council may effectively represent the entire [[government]]. A [[board of directors]] might also be denoted as a council. A [[committee]] might also be denoted as a council, though a committee is generally a subordinate body composed of members of a larger body, while a council may not be. Because many schools have a [[student council]], the council is the form of governance with which many people are likely to have their first experience as electors or participants.

A member of a council may be referred to as a '''councillor''' or '''councilperson''', or by the gender-specific titles of '''councilman''' and '''councilwoman'''.

{{Civil procedure (United States)}}
&lt;!--This article is in US English--&gt;
A '''demurrer''' is a [[pleading]] in a [[lawsuit]] that objects to or challenges a pleading filed by an opposing [[Party (law)|party]]. The word ''demur'' means "to object"; a ''demurrer'' is the document that makes the objection. Lawyers informally define a demurrer as a defendant saying "So what?" to the pleading.&lt;ref name=Jordan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jordan|first1=Paul D.|title=Paralegal Studies: An Introduction|date=2001|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Albany, NY|isbn=9780314127235|page=183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b2Q5v0_se8QC&amp;pg=PA183|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, the [[defendant]] in a case will demur to the [[complaint]], but it is also possible for the [[plaintiff]] to demur to an [[Answer (law)|answer]]. The demurrer challenges the legal sufficiency of a cause of action in a complaint or of an affirmative defense in an answer. If a [[cause of action]] in a complaint does not state a cognizable claim (e.g., the claim is nonsense) or if it does not state all the required [[element (criminal law)|elements]], then the challenged cause of action or possibly the entire complaint can be thrown out (informally speaking) at the demurrer stage as not legally sufficient. A demurrer is typically filed near the beginning of a case in response to the plaintiff filing a complaint or the defendant answering the complaint.

In [[common law]], a demurrer was the pleading through which a defendant challenged the legal sufficiency of a complaint in [[criminal law|criminal]] or [[civil law (common law)|civil]] cases. Today, however, the pleading has been discontinued in many [[jurisdiction]]s, including the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States federal courts|U.S. federal court system]], and most U.S. states (though some states, including [[California law|California]], Pennsylvania, and [[Virginia Circuit Court#The demurrer|Virginia]], retain it).  In criminal cases, a demurrer was considered a [[common law]] [[due process]] right, to be heard and decided before the defendant was required to plead "not guilty," or make any other pleading in response, without having to admit or deny any of the facts [[Allegation|alleged]].

A demurrer generally ''assumes'' the truth of all material facts alleged in the complaint and the defendant cannot present evidence to the contrary, even if those facts appear to be obvious fabrications by the plaintiff or are likely to be easily disproved during [[Lawsuit|litigation]]. That is, the point of the demurrer is to test whether a cause of action or affirmative defense ''as pleaded'' is legally insufficient, even if all facts pleaded are assumed to be true. 

The sole exception to the no-evidence rule is that a court may take [[judicial notice]] of certain things. For example, the court can take judicial notice of commonly known facts not reasonably subject to challenge, such as the [[Gregorian calendar]], or of [[public record]]s, such as a published legislative report showing the intent of the legislature in enacting a particular statute.

==Overview==

===Civil cases===
A demurrer is commonly filed by a defendant in response to a complaint filed by the [[plaintiff]]. A demurrer to a complaint can terminate a lawsuit. Although a plaintiff may demur to a defendant's answer to a complaint or the defendant's [[affirmative defense]]s, a demurrer to an answer is less common because it may be a poor [[Strategy|strategic move]]. A demurrer to an answer may simplify a lawsuit, but it usually will not end the lawsuit; it is normally used only when the plaintiff intends to move for [[summary judgment]] in their favor at the earliest opportunity and needs to preemptively attack some of the defendant's affirmative defenses.  

Technically, a demurrer is not a ''[[Motion (legal)|motion]];'' a party does not file a ''motion for demurrer'' nor ''move the court to demur.'' Rather, a demurrer is a particular type of pleading and demurring is the act by which a party formally requests the court to dismiss a [[cause of action]] (claim) or the entire complaint.  

In lay terms, a judge who sustains a demurrer is saying that the law does not recognize a legal claim for the facts stated by the complaining party. If the judge [[Objection (law)|overrule]]s a demurrer, the court is allowing the claim or case to proceed.  

In legal terms, the demurring party asserts that the complaint or [[counterclaim]] does not amount to a legally valid claim, even if the factual allegations contained in the complaint or counterclaim are accepted as true.  

Usually, a demurrer attacks a complaint as missing one or more required elements of a claim. Those elements are usually attacked by showing that the plaintiff failed to plead an essential element ''per se'' or facts that adequately support it (e.g., facts giving rise to an actionable duty running from the defendant to the plaintiff). Another method is to attack the entire cause of action itself as abolished or prohibited as against public policy (e.g., [[wrongful life]] is against public policy in most jurisdictions). 

Demurrers are decided by a judge rather than a [[jury]]. The judge either grants the demurrer by sustaining it, or denies it by overruling the demurrer. If the demurrer is overruled, the defendant is ordered to file an answer within a certain period of time or else risk a [[default judgment]]. Once the answer is filed, then the case is said to be "at issue" (because there are now a complaint and answer on file opposing each other with the parties' respective provisions), and the case proceeds to the [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] stage.  

In the alternative, a judge may sustain a demurrer [[Prejudice (legal procedure)|with prejudice]] or without prejudice.  With prejudice means the plaintiff cannot file another complaint attempting to fix insufficiencies of the previous complaint. If the demurrer is granted without prejudice and/or with leave to amend, then the plaintiff may correct errors filing a corrected and/or amended complaint. Demurrers sustained with prejudice are reserved for when the judge determines a plaintiff cannot cure or fix the complaint by rewriting or amending it. Depending upon the severity of the defect in a complaint, a court may sustain with prejudice on the first demurrer (very rare) or allow the plaintiff as many as three or four attempts before sustaining a demurrer to a third or fourth amended complaint with prejudice.

===Criminal cases===

In criminal cases, a demurrer may be used in some circumstances to challenge the legal sufficiency of the [[indictment]] or other similar [[United States criminal procedure#Charging instruments|charging instrument]]. Traditionally, if the defendant could admit every allegation of the indictment and still be innocent of any crime, then a ''general demurrer'' would be sustained and the indictment would be dismissed. A ''special demurrer'' refers to an attack on the form, rather than the substance, of the charge: if the defendant correctly identifies some defect "on the face" of the indictment, then the charges are subject to being dismissed, although usually the indictment can be redrawn (rewritten) and re-presented to the [[grand jury]] or other charging authority. While there are different ways to accomplish the goals of a special demurrer, often an alternative method to challenge the sufficiency of the indictment is an attack on the [[Prosecutor|prosecution]]'s case prior to trial, and is generally made by means of [[Motion (legal)#Motion to dismiss|motion to dismiss]].

==England and Wales==
'''In civil law''' a demurrer as such is no longer available under the current [[English law|law of England and Wales]]. However, two similar procedures may be employed where claims without merit need to be expeditiously dismissed.

First, an ''application on notice'' can be made for [[summary judgment]] in favor of the objecting party. Second, the court has power to strike out the [[Pleading (England and Wales)#Particulars of Claim|Particulars of Claim]].

To have a non-meritorious claim dismissed, however, the distinction between the two procedures is that when the Particulars of Claim are struck out, the claimant usually has another opportunity to file an amended Particulars of Claim, within, for example, four weeks, whereas Summary Judgment is final, though subject to appeal.

In criminal law demurrer is obsolete, although not formally abolished. It has been superseded by the more modern ''[[motion to quash]]'', usually a verbal application to the judge to rule the [[indictment]] null and void and to stop the case. (Demurrer was pleaded in writing).

==United States==

===Federal courts===
In civil cases in the [[United States district court]]s, the demurrer was expressly abolished by Rule 7(c) of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] ("FRCP", also "Federal Rules") when the FRCP went into effect on September 16, 1938. The demurrer was replaced by the Rule 12(b)(6) [[Motion (legal)#Motion to dismiss|motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim]] upon which relief can be granted.  

The demurrer was abolished after American lawyers realized that the pleadings should frame only those issues that will be actively litigated through motion practice once both sides have fully stated their positions and the case is at issue. Although the demurrer technically also framed the issues in a case, treating the demurrer as a pleading came to be seen as irrational because it was the ''only'' pleading that required an immediate hearing and ruling on its content (which consisted of an attack upon the complaint), while the complaint and the answer merely stated the respective positions of each side but did not require [[Hearing (law)|hearing]]s in and of themselves. Thus, it made sense that a discretionary attack upon the complaint that was already being drafted, calendared, heard, and ruled upon like a motion should simply be treated like one.

Having purged the demurrer from federal courts, Rule 7(c) was deemed obsolete by the [[Advisory Committee on Civil Rules]] during the 2002–2007 FRCP revision cycle. It was therefore deleted from the version of the FRCP that went into effect on December 1, 2007.

===State courts===

A majority of U.S. states (approximately 35) have adopted civil procedure rules modeled after the Federal Rules and therefore have abolished the demurrer and replaced it with the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. In [[Supreme Court of Ohio|Ohio]], for example, demurrers are specifically prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;Ohio Rule of Civil Procedure 7(C) ("Demurrers shall not be used").&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a demurrer can still be filed by the defendant in a minority of U.S. [[State court (United States)|state court]] systems. Demurrers are still used in [[Supreme Court of California|California]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/cacode/CCP/3/2/6/3/1/s430.10 California Code of Civil Procedure Section 430.10.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Supreme Court of Virginia|Virginia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+8.01-273 Code of Virginia Section 8.01-273.]&lt;/ref&gt; state court civil practice. In California, a demurrer must assume the truth of the facts alleged by the complaining party, but challenges the complaint as a matter of law.&lt;ref&gt;Hensler v. City of Glendale(1994) 8 Cal.4th 1 &lt;/ref&gt; If a demurrer is sustained regarding the form of the complaint, leave to amend is liberally granted, and denial of leave to amend may constitute an abuse of discretion.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, when children are removed from their parents and taken into foster care in California, the parents may challenge the sufficiency of the dependency complaint by means of a ''motion akin to demurrer'', which operates similarly to a demurrer.&lt;ref&gt;In re Fred J. (1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 168&lt;/ref&gt; However, demurrers are prohibited in California in other family law actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=California Rules of Court, rule 5.74(b)(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in California, a demurrer is not said to be "granted," but is said to be "sustained" or "overruled." An order sustaining a demurrer is not a readily appealable order unless it disposes of an entire action without leave to amend and results in a judgment.&lt;ref&gt;9 WITKIN, California Procedure (5th), ''Appeal'', Section 154 and 5 WITKIN, California Procedure (5th), ''Pleading'', Section 997.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term ''preliminary objection'' is used in [[Judiciary of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania state court]] to refer to all motions made after the filing of a complaint but before the filing of an answer; preliminary objections may be made "in the nature of a demurrer" (seeking to dismiss a cause of action for legal insufficiency) or "in the nature of a [[motion to strike (court of law)|motion to strike]]" (seeking to remove parts of a pleading for failure to abide by the technical rules), as well as various other means.&lt;ref&gt;Pa. R.C.P. 1028&lt;/ref&gt; As with the traditional demurrer, preliminary objections are regarded as pleadings. Preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer are governed by Rule 1028(a)(4) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure.

[[File:Dog baiting.jpg|thumb|[[Azim Azimzade]]. "Dog baiting". 1938]]

'''Dog fighting''' is a type of [[blood sport]] generally defined as two or more [[Game (dog)|game dogs]] against one another in a ring or a pit for the [[entertainment]] of the spectators or the gratification of the dogfighters, who are sometimes referred to as dogmen.&lt;ref name="Gibson 2005"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibson |first=Hannah |url=http://animallaw.info/topics/tabbed%20topic%20page/spusdogfighting.htm |title=Quick Summary of Dog Fighting |publisher=Animal Legal and Historical Center at Michigan State University College of Law |year=2005 |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In rural areas, fights are often staged in barns or outdoor pits; in urban areas, fights may occur in garages, basements, warehouses, abandoned buildings, back alleys, neighborhood playgrounds, or in the streets.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibson |first=Hannah |url=http://animallaw.info/articles/ddusdogfighting.htm|title=Detailed Discussion of Dog Fighting |publisher=Animal Legal and Historical Center at Michigan State University College of Law |year=2005 |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Pitt Bulls: Villains or Victims?

Dog fighting generates revenue from [[Dog breeding|stud]] fees, admission fees and [[gambling]]. Worldwide, several countries have banned dog fighting, but it is still legal in some countries like Japan, Honduras, and parts of Russia.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info"/&gt;

[[Blood sport]]s in general can be traced back to the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Villavicencio"&gt;{{cite web|last=Villavicencio |first=Monica |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12108421 |title=A History of Dogfighting |publisher=NPR |date=2007-07-19 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 13 BC, for instance, the ancient Roman circus slew 600 African beasts.&lt;ref name="Favre"&gt;{{cite book |last=Favre |first=David |date=2011-05-16 |title=Animal Law: Welfare, Interests, and Rights |url=https://www.amazon.com/Animal-Welfare-Interests-Elective-ebook/dp/B00AYLLE9G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383051673&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=animal+welfare+david+favre |location=Frederick, MD |publisher=Wolter Kluwer Law and Business |isbn=978-1-4548-3398-7 |accessdate=2013-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, under Emperor Claudius's reign, as spectators cheered, 300 bears and 300 Libyan beasts were slain in the [[Colosseum]].&lt;ref name="Favre"/&gt; Dog fighting, more specifically, can also be traced to ancient Roman times. In 43 AD, for example, dogs fought alongside the Romans and the British in the [[Roman Conquest of Britain]].&lt;ref name="Villavicencio"/&gt; In this war, the Romans used a breed that originated from Greece called [[Molossus (dog)|Molossus]]; the Britons used broad-mouth Mastiffs, which were thought to descend from the Molossus bloodline and which also originated from Greece.&lt;ref name="Massey"&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=M.A. |first=Wil |last=Massey |title=Bloodsport and the Michael Vick Dogfighting Case: A Critical Cultural Analysis |publisher=East Tennessee University |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the British were outnumbered and ultimately lost this war, the Romans were so impressed with the [[English Mastiff]]s that they began to import these dogs for use in the [[Colosseum]], as well as for use in times of war.&lt;ref name="Villavicencio"/&gt; While spectators watched, the imported English Mastiffs were pitted against animals such as wild elephants, lions, bears, bulls, and gladiators.&lt;ref name="Villavicencio"/&gt;

Later, the Romans bred and exported fighting dogs to Spain, France and other parts of Europe until eventually these dogs made their way back to England.&lt;ref name="Villavicencio"/&gt; Though [[Bull-baiting|bull baiting]] and [[bear baiting]] were popular throughout the Middle Ages up to the 19th century in Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, the British pitted dogs against bulls and bears on a scale like no other.&lt;ref name="Massey"/&gt; In 12th century England during the feudal era, the landed aristocracy, who held direct military control in decentralized feudal systems and thus owned the animals necessary for waging war, introduced bull baiting and bear baiting to the rest of the British population.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt; In later years, bull baiting and bear baiting became a popular source of entertainment for the British royalty.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt; For instance, [[Queen Elizabeth I]], who reigned from 1558–1603, was an avid follower of bull and bear baiting; she bred Mastiffs for baiting and would entertain foreign guests with a fight whenever they visited England.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt; In addition to breeding Mastiffs and entertaining foreign guests with a fight, Queen Elizabeth, and later her successor, King James I, built a number of bear gardens in London.&lt;ref name="Fleig 1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fleig |first= Dieter|year=1996 |title=The History of Fighting Dogs |url= |location=Neptune, NJ|publisher=TFH Publications |isbn= |accessdate=2013-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The garden buildings were round and roofless, and housed not only bears, but also bulls and other wild animals that could be used in a fight.&lt;ref name="Fleig 1996"/&gt; Today, a person can visit the Bear Garden museum near the Shakespeare Global Complex in Bankside, Southwark.

With the popularity of bull and bear baiting, bears needed for such fights soon became scarce.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt; With the scarcity of bear population, the price of bears rose and, because of this, bull baiting became more common in England over time.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt; Bulls who survived the fights were slaughtered afterwards for their meat, as it was believed that the fight caused bull meat to become more tender.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt; In fact, if a bull was offered for sale in the market without having been baited the previous day, butchers were liable to face substantial fines.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt; Animal fights were temporarily suspended in England when [[Oliver Cromwell]] seized power, but were reinstated again after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]].&lt;ref name="Fleig 1996"/&gt; Dog fighting, bear baiting, and bull baiting were officially outlawed in England by the Humane Act of 1835.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info"/&gt; The official ban on all fights, however, actually served to promote dog fighting in England.&lt;ref name="Fleig 1996"/&gt; Since a small amount of space was required for the pit where a dog fight took place, as compared to the ring needed for bull or bear baiting, authorities had a difficult time enforcing the ban on dog fighting.&lt;ref name="Fleig 1996"/&gt;

==U.S. history==
In 1817, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier was brought to America and dog fighting became part of American culture.&lt;ref name="Gibson 2005"/&gt; Yet, though historical accounts of dog fighting in America can be dated back to the 1750s, it was not until the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861–1865) that widespread interest and participation in the blood sport began in the United States.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011" /&gt; For instance, in 1881, the Mississippi and Ohio railroads advertised special fares to a dog fight in Louisville; public forums such as Kit Burns' Tavern, "The Sportman's Hall," in Manhattan regularly hosted matches.&lt;ref name="Gibson 2005"/&gt; Many of these dogs thrown into the "professional pits" that flourished during the 1860s came from England and Ireland—where citizens had turned to dogs when [[bear-baiting]] and [[bull-baiting]] became illegal in their countries.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011" /&gt;

In twentieth century America, despite the expansion of laws to outlaw dog fighting, dog fighting continued to flourish underground.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011" /&gt; Aiding in the expansion of dog fighting were the police and firemen, who saw dog fighting as a form of entertainment amongst their ranks.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011" /&gt; In fact, the Police Gazette served as a "go to" source for information about where one could attend a fight.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011" /&gt; When [[Henry Bergh]], who started the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA), witnessed police involvement in these fights, he was motivated to seek and receive authority for the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Agents to have arresting power in New York.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011" /&gt; Additionally, Bergh's 1867 revision to New York's animal cruelty law made all forms of animal fighting illegal.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011" /&gt; However, According to the ASPCA website, the Humane Law Enforcement department of ASPCA has been disbanded and NYPD has taken over its duty.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011" /&gt; As laws were passed to outlaw the activity, high-profile organizations, such as the United Kennel Club, who once endorsed the sport by formulating rules and sanctioning referees, withdrew their endorsement.&lt;ref name="Gibson 2005" /&gt;

On July 8, 2009, the ASPCA also participated in one of the largest federal dog fighting raids in U.S. history. Most of the dogs rescued were [[pit bull]]s (over 400 of them). This raid took place in eight states and had 26 arrests, of which two defendants are required to spend at least 10 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Historic Eight-State Dog Fighting Raid—July 2009|url = https://www.aspca.org/fight-cruelty/field-investigations-and-response-team/blood-sports/historic-eight-state-dog-fighting-raid-july|website = ASPCA|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breed origins===
[[File:George Morland - Fighting Dogs.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Fighting Dogs'' by [[George Morland]], circa 1800]]
According to one scholar, Richard Strebel, the foundation for modern fighting dogs came from: 1. The [[Tibetan Mastiff]]; 2. The [[English Mastiff]], out of which came the [[Dogue de Bordeaux|French Mastiff]], the [[Bulldog|English Bulldog]], and the [[Pug]]; 3. The [[Great Dane]], out of which came the [[Broholmer|Danish Mastiff]] and the [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]]; 4. The [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]]; and 5. The [[St. Bernard (dog)|Saint Bernard]], out of which came the [[Leonberger]].&lt;ref name="Fleig 1996"/&gt; However, Dieter Fleig disagreed with Strebel and offered the following list as composing of the foundation for modern fighting dogs: 1. The Tibetan Mastiff; 2. The [[Molossus (dog)|Molossus]]; 3. The [[Bullenbeisser|Bull Biter]]; 4. The Great Dane; 5. The English Mastiff; 6. The [[Bulldog]]; 5. The [[Bull and Terrier]]; and 6. The Chincha Bulldog.&lt;ref name="Fleig 1996"/&gt;

The foundation breed of the fighting dog was, in its outward appearance, a large, low, heavy breed with a powerful build and strongly developed head, and tremendously threatening voice.&lt;ref name="Fleig 1996"/&gt; Additionally, these foundation breeds were also bred for a powerful jaw that would enable them to defend and protect humans, to overpower and pull down large animals on a hunt, and to control large, unmanageable domestic animals.&lt;ref name="Fleig 1996"/&gt; These dogs were also sometimes equipped with metal plates, chains, and collars with sharp spikes or hooked knives in order to be used in wars throughout history.&lt;ref name="Fleig 1996"/&gt;

When bullbaiting became popular in England due to the shortage of bears, bull baiters soon realized that large fighting dogs were built too heavy and too slow for this type of combat.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt; When fighting a bull, dogs were trained to grab onto the bull's nose and pin the bull's head to the ground.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt; If the dog failed to do this, the bull would fling the dog out of the ring with its horns.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt; The British therefore decided to selectively breed fighting dogs for shorter legs and a more powerful jaw.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt; These efforts resulted in the [[Old English Bulldog]].&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt;

However, when countries started outlawing bull and bear baiting, dog fighters started pitting dogs against other dogs.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt; With the prevalence of such combat, dogfighters soon realized bulldogs were inadequate and began to breed bulldogs with terriers for more desired characteristics.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt; Terriers were most likely crossbred with bulldogs due to their "generally rugged body structure," speed, aggression, and "highly developed gameness."&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt; Yet, there is a debate over which type of terrier was bred with bulldogs in order to create the Bull and Terrier. For instance, Joseph L. Colby claimed that it was the old English White Terrier that the Bull and Terrier is descended from, while Rhonda D. Evans and Craig J. Forsyth contend that its ancestor is the Rat Terrier.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt; Carl Semencic, on the other hand, held that a variety of terriers produced the Bull and Terrier.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt;

Eventually, out of cross breeding bulldogs and terriers, the English created the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011" /&gt; When the [[Staffordshire Bull Terrier]] came to America in 1817, Americans began to selectively breed for [[gameness]] and created the [[American Pit Bull Terrier]] (originally known as the Pit Bull Terrier), which is a unique breed due to its absence of threat displays when fighting and its docility towards humans.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt; Staffordshire Bull Terriers, American Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, and Bull Terriers are all breeds that are commonly labeled as pit bulls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=staff |first= |url=http://animallaw.info/local/topics/lotobsl.htm

==Societal aspects==
After interviewing 31 dogmen and attending 14 dog fights in the Southern United States, Evans, Gauthier, and Forsyth theorized on what attracts men to dog fights.&lt;ref name="Iliopoulou 125–140"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Iliopoulou |first=Maria A.  |last2=Rosenbaum |first2=Rene P.  |date= |title=Understanding Blood Sports |url= |journal=Journal of Animal &amp; Natural Resource Law |publisher=Michigan State University College of Law |volume=9 |issue= |pages=125–140 |doi= |accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their study, Evans, et al., discussed dog fighting's attractiveness in terms of masculinity and class immobility.&lt;ref name="Iliopoulou 125–140"/&gt; In the United States, masculinity embodies the qualities of strength, aggression, competition, and striving for success. By embodying these characteristics, a man can gain honor and status in his society.&lt;ref name="Iliopoulou 125–140"/&gt; Yet, working class occupations, unlike middle or upper class occupations, provide limited opportunities to validate this culturally accepted definition of masculinity.&lt;ref name="Iliopoulou 125–140"/&gt; So, working class men look for alternative ways to validate their masculinity and obtain honor and status. One way to do this is through dogfighting.&lt;ref name="Iliopoulou 125–140"/&gt; This is supported by the Evans, et al. findings: the majority of committed dogmen were mostly drawn from the working class, while the middle and upper classes were barely represented.&lt;ref name="Iliopoulou 125–140"/&gt; Men from middle and upper classes have opportunities to express their masculinity through their occupations; dog fighting, therefore, is just a hobby for them while it plays a central role in the lives of working class men.&lt;ref name="Iliopoulou 125–140"/&gt; Those from the higher classes are drawn in by the thrill and excitement of the fight.

Aside from enjoyment of the sport and status, people are also drawn to dog fighting for money.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011"/&gt; In fact, the average dog fight could easily net more money than an armed robbery, or a series of isolated drug transactions.&lt;ref name="Gibson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibson|first=Hannah|title=Overview of Dog Fighting|url=http://animallaw.info/topics/tabbed%20topic%20page/spusdogfighting.htm|work=Animal Legal and Historical Center|publisher=Michigan State University College of Law|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bait animals===
{{Main article|Dog-baiting}}
"Bait" animals are animals used to test a dog's fighting instinct; they are often mauled or killed in the process. Many of the training methods involve torturing and killing of other animals.&lt;ref name="Gibson"/&gt; Often "bait" animals are stolen pets, puppies, kittens, rabbits, small dogs and even stock (pit bulls acquired by the dogfighting ring which appear to be passive or less dominant).&lt;ref name="thedogpress.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedogpress.com/SideEffects/0710_Vick_Amicus-Brief-090207.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025132134/http://www.thedogpress.com/SideEffects/0710_Vick_Amicus-Brief-090207.htm |archivedate=2008-10-25 |title=Michael Vick Sentencing Plea To Court Filed on Behalf of Pit Bull Victims, Dog Owners, ADOA, NAIS and Other Groups }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources for bait animals include wild or feral animals, animals obtained from a shelter, or animals obtained from "free to good home" ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/02/0218_040218_dogfighting.html |title=U.S. Dog-Fighting Rings Stealing Pets for "Bait" |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The snouts of bait animals are often wrapped with duct tape to prevent them from fighting back and they are used in training sessions to improve a dog's endurance, strength or fighting ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedogpress.com/SideEffects/0710_Vick_Amicus-Brief-090207.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025132134/http://www.thedogpress.com/SideEffects/0710_Vick_Amicus-Brief-090207.htm |archivedate=2008-10-25 |title=Congressional commentary to 7 U.S.C. §2156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A bait animal's teeth may also be broken to prevent them from fighting back.&lt;ref name="thedogpress.com"/&gt; If the bait animals are still alive after the training sessions, they are usually given to the dogs as a reward, and the dogs finish killing them.&lt;ref name="Gibson"/&gt;

===Types of dog fighters===

====Street fighters====
Often associated with gang activity, street fighters fight dogs over insults, turf invasions, or simple taunts like "my dog can kill your dog."&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011"/&gt; These type of fights are often spontaneous; unorganized; conducted for money, drugs, or bragging rights; and occur on street corners, back alleys, and neighborhood playgrounds.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011"/&gt; Urban street fighters generally have several dogs chained in backyards, often behind privacy fences, or in basements or garages.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info"/&gt; After a street fight, the dogs are often discovered by police and animal control officers either dead or dying.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011"/&gt; Due to the spontaneity of a street fight, they are very difficult to respond to unless reported immediately.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011"/&gt;

Hobbyists and professionals often decry the techniques street fighters use to train their dogs.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011"/&gt; Such techniques include starving, drugging, and physically abusing the dog.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011"/&gt;

====Hobbyists====
Hobbyists fight dogs for supplemental income and entertainment purposes.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011"/&gt; They typically have one or more dogs participating in several organized fights and operate primarily within a specific geographic network.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011"/&gt; Hobbyists are also acquainted with one another and tend to return to predetermined fight venues repeatedly.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info"/&gt;

====Professionals====
Professional fighters breed generations of skilled "game dogs" and take a great pride in their dogs' lineage.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info"/&gt; These fighters make a tremendous amount of money charging stud fees to breed their champions, in addition to the fees and winnings they collect for fighting them.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info"/&gt; They also tend to own a large number of dogs—sometimes 50 or more.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011"/&gt; Professionals also use trade journals, such as Your Friend and Mine, Game Dog Times, The American Warrior, and The Pit Bull Chronicle, to discuss recent fights and to advertise the sale of training equipment and puppies. Some fighters operate on a national or even international level within highly secret networks.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info"/&gt; When a dog is not successful in a fight, a professional may dispose of it using a variety of techniques such as drowning, strangulation, hanging, gunshot, electrocution or some other method.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011"/&gt; Sometimes professionals and hobbyists dispose of dogs deemed aggressive to humans to street fighters.&lt;ref name="Boucher 2011"/&gt;

===Gang and criminal activities===
[[Image:Dog fighting gang members caught on hidden surveillance camera .jpg|right|thumb|Gang members dog fighting in a vacant office building]]

Dog fighting is a felony in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info"/&gt; While dog fighting statutes exist independently of general anti-cruelty statutes and carry stiffer penalties than general state anti-cruelty statutes, a person can be charged under both or can be charged under one, but not the other—depending on the evidence.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info"/&gt; In addition to felony charges for dog fighting, forty-eight states and the District of Columbia, have provisions within their dogfighting statutes that explicitly prohibit attendance as a spectator at a dogfighting exhibition.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info"/&gt; Since Montana and Hawaii do not have such provisions, a person can pay an entrance fee to watch a dog-fight in either state and not be convicted under these statutes. Additionally, forty-six states, and the District of Columbia, make possessing, owning or keeping a fighting dog a felony.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info"/&gt;

While dog fighting was previously seen as isolated animal welfare issues—and therefore rarely enforced, the last decade has produced a growing body of legal and empirical evidence that has revealed a connection between dog-fighting and other crimes within a community, such as organized crime, racketeering, drug distribution, and/or gangs.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info"/&gt; Within the gang community, fighting dogs compete with firearms as the weapon of choice; indeed, their versatile utility arguably surpasses that of a loaded firearm in the criminal underground. Drug dealers distribute their illicit merchandise, wagers are made, weapons are concealed, and the dogs mutilate each other in a bloody frenzy as crowds cheer on.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info"/&gt; Violence often erupts among the usually armed gamblers when debts are to be collected and paid.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info"/&gt; There is also a concern for children who are routinely exposed to dogfighting and are forced to accept the inherent violence as normal.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info"/&gt; The routine exposure of the children to unfettered animal abuse and neglect is a major contributing factor in their later manifestation of social deviance.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info"/&gt;

===Animal welfare and rights===
Animal advocates consider dog fighting to be one of the most serious forms of [[animal abuse]], not only for the violence that the dogs endure during and after the fights, but because of the suffering they often endure in training.

According to a filing in U.S. District Court in Richmond by federal investigators in Virginia, which was obtained under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] and published by ''[[the Baltimore Sun]]'' on July 6, 2007, a losing dog or one whose potential is considered unacceptable faces "being put to death by drowning, strangulation, hanging, gun shot, electrocution or some other method".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doggydanstheonlinedogtrainerreviews.com/|title=Doggy Dans The Online Dog Trainer Reviews|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the training of fighting dogs may entail the use of small animals (including kittens) as prey for the dogs.

==Status by region==
Dog fighting has been popular in many countries throughout history and continues to be practiced both legally and illegally around the world.

In the 20th and 21st centuries, dog fighting has increasingly become an unlawful activity in most of the world.

===Africa===

====Morocco====
Dog fighting is illegal in Morocco, with dogs previously being imported from France on the [[black market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Senoussi |first1=Zoubida |title=Moroccan Government Unveils Final List of Banned Dog Breeds |url=https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2018/08/251970/moroccan-government-unveils-final-list-of-banned-dog-breeds/ |accessdate=30 August 2018 |work=[[Morocco World News]] |date=9 August 2018 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Africa====
Dog fighting has been declared illegal in the Republic of South Africa. However, it is still very popular in the underground world, with dog fighting being a highly syndicated and organized crime. The [[NSPCA]] ([[National Council of SPCAs]]) is the largest animal welfare organization in Africa, and has been the organization that has conducted the most raids and busts, of which the most recent was in 2013, where 18 people were arrested, and 14 dogs were involved. Dog fighting is mostly practiced in the Western Cape, in the townships area where gangs and drugs are mostly associated with dog fighting.

Dog fighting has been documented in South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region of [[Stellenbosch]]. The Stellenbosch Animal Welfare Society (AWS) frequently responds to complaints of night-time dog fighting in the town of Cloetesville in which hundreds of dogs fight. Young children may be used to transport fighting dogs to avoid arrest of the owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animal-info.co.za/dog-fights-back-news-again.html |title=Dog fights are back in the news… again |publisher=Animal-info.co.za |date= |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Murphy |first=Caryle |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-167924565.html |title=Hundreds of animals savaged in night-time dog fighting in Cloetesville |publisher=Highbeam.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===

====Afghanistan====
Previously banned by the [[Taliban]], dog fighting has made a resurgence throughout [[Afghanistan]] as a winter weekend pastime.

In [[Kabul]], the fights are public and policed for safety to the spectators. Dogs are not fought to the death, but to submission. Top dogs are worth as much as a new car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://content.time.com/time/video/player/0,32068,810066760001_2056513,00.html | title=The Dog Fighters of Kabul | work=Time | accessdate=February 19, 2014 | author=Motlagh, Jason | location=Kabul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====China====
Dog fighting is allowed under Chinese law, although [[Gambling in China|gambling remains illegal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Moon |first1=Louise |title=Police break up dog-fighting ring in China where dog fights are legal but gambling is not |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2142422/chinese-police-break-underground-dog-fighting-ring-run-pensioners |accessdate=30 August 2018 |work=South China Morning Post |date=19 April 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
Dog fighting is not common, but can be found in some Indian states such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and in some parts of Delhi. The practice is [[law|illegal]] as defined by Indian law.

====Japan====
According to historical documents, [[Hōjō Takatoki]], the 14th [[shikken]] (''[[shōgun]]''{{'}}s regent) of the [[Kamakura shogunate]] was known to be obsessed with dog fighting, to the point where he allowed his [[samurai]] to pay taxes with dogs. During this period dog fighting was known as {{nihongo|''inuawase''|犬合わせ}}.

Dog fighting was considered a way for the Samurai to retain their aggressive edge during peaceful times. Several ''[[daimyō]]s'' (feudal lords), such as [[Chōsokabe Motochika]] and [[Yamauchi Yōdō]], both from [[Tosa Province]] (present-day [[Kōchi Prefecture]]), were known to encourage dog fighting. Dog fighting was also popular in [[Akita Prefecture]], which is the origin of the [[Akita Inu|Akita]] breed.

Dog fighting evolved in [[Kōchi Prefecture|Kōchi]] to a form that is called {{nihongo|''tōken''|闘犬}}. Under modern rules, dogs fight in a fenced ring until one of the dogs barks, yelps, or loses the will to fight. Owners are allowed to throw in the towel, and matches are stopped if a doctor judges if is too dangerous. Draws usually occur when both dogs will not fight or both dogs fight until the time limit. There are various other rules, including one that specifies that a dog will lose if it attempts to [[mating|copulate]]. Champion dogs are called [[yokozuna (sumo)|yokozuna]], as in [[sumo]]. Dog fighting is not banned at a nationwide level, but the prefectures of [[Tokyo]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture|Kanagawa]], [[Fukui Prefecture|Fukui]], [[Ishikawa Prefecture|Ishikawa]], [[Toyama Prefecture|Toyama]] and [[Hokkaidō]] all ban the practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weblio.jp/content/%E9%97%98%E7%8A%AC%E3%80%81%E9%97%98%E9%B6%8F%E3%80%81%E9%97%98%E7%89%9B%E7%AD%89%E5%8F%96%E7%B7%A0%E6%9D%A1%E4%BE%8B Weblio Dictionary] {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, most fighting dogs in Japan are of the [[Tosa (dog)|Tosa]] breed which is native to Kōchi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bulldoginformation.com/Tosa-inu.html |title=Tosa inu history and breed information |work=Bulldog Information |accessdate=2007-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
Dog fighting and other forms of animal fighting are extremely popular in all parts of rural [[Pakistan]], and is deeply rooted in the rural culture, where some 70 percent of the population resides. It has been a way for tribes, clans and the rural people to socialize while being entertained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The horrific world of dog fighting tournaments in Pakistan | url =

Even though it has recently been banned by law, it is still being practiced in rural Pakistan, especially in provinces such as [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Azad Kashmir]], [[Sindh]] and [[Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa]]. Now Karachi.Sindhi is the most popular city about Pitbull fighting with the proper rules There can apparently be as much as millions of [[Pakistani Rupees|rupees]] at stake for the owners of winning dogs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dog fighting in pakistan is alive and kicking | url =

====Russia====
Although animal cruelty laws exist in Russia, dog fighting is widely practiced. Laws prohibiting dogfights have been passed in certain places like Moscow by order of that city's mayor. In much of Russia dogfights are legally held generally using [[Caucasian Shepherd Dog]], [[Georgian shepherd]], [[Central Asian Shepherd Dog]]. [[Temperament test]]s, which are a common and relatively mild form of dog fighting used for breeding purposes, are fairly commonplace. Most dog fights are traditional contests used to test the stamina and ability of working dogs used to protect livestock. Unlike fights with pit bulls and other fighting breeds, a veterinarian is always on hand and the contests are never to the death, and serious injuries are very rare. Most fights are over in minutes when its clear which dog is superior. At the end of three rounds the contest is declared a draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/09/world/europe/09dogfight.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1 |title=A Brutal Sport Is Having Its Day Again in Russia |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Dog fighting in the United States}}
Dog fighting has been illegal in Canada since 1892; however, the current law requires police to catch individuals during the unlawful act, which is often difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cfhs.ca/law/federal_legislation/ |title=Canadian Federal Legislation regarding animal welfare |publisher=Cfhs.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-05-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606101201/http://cfhs.ca/law/federal_legislation |archive-date=2011-06-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dog fighting is a felony in all 50 U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info"/&gt;  In most of the United States a spectator at a dog fight can be charged with a felony while some areas only consider it a misdemeanor offense.

In addition, the federal U.S. [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly sell, buy, possess, train, transport, deliver, or receive any dog for purposes of having the dog participate in an animal fighting venture. The act also makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly use the mail service of the [[United States Postal Service]] or any instrumentality of interstate commerce for commercial speech for purposes of advertising a dog for use in an animal fighting venture, promoting or in any other manner furthering an animal fighting venture except as performed outside the limits of the States of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |url=http://animallaw.info/statutes/stusawa.htm#2156|title=The Animal Welfare Act |publisher=[[United States Code]] |year=2008 |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by the [[College of Law of Michigan State University]] published in 2005, in the United States, dog fighting was once completely legal and was sanctioned and promoted during the colonial period through the Victorian and well into the 20th century. In the second half 19th century dog fighting started to be criminalized in the United States.

[[CNN]] estimated that in the United States more than 100,000 people are engaged in dog fighting on a non-professional basis and roughly 40,000 individuals are involved as professionals in the sport of dog fighting as a commercial activity.

Dog fighting is illegal in much of [[South America]]. The [[American Pit Bull Terrier]] is by far the most common breed involved in the bloodsport. The [[Dogo Argentino]] was also used as fighting dog. The [[Dogo Cubano]] and [[Cordoba Fighting Dog]] were used for fighting a century ago, but have become extinct.

An '''indexed annuity''' (the word ''equity'' previously tied to indexed annuities has been removed to help prevent the assumption of stock market investing being present in these products) in the United States is a type of tax-deferred [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] whose credited interest is linked to an equity index &amp;mdash; typically the [[S&amp;P 500]] or international index. It guarantees a minimum interest rate (typically between 1% and 3%) if held to the end of the surrender term and protects against a loss of principal. An equity index annuity is a contract with an insurance or annuity company. The returns may be higher than fixed instruments such as CDs, money market accounts, and bonds but not as high as market returns. Equity Index Annuities are insured by each State's Guarantee Fund; coverage is not as strong as the insurance provided by the FDIC. For example, in [[California]] the fund will cover "80% not to exceed $250,000." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.annuityadvantage.com/stateguarantee.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The guarantees in the contract are backed by the relative strength of the insurer.  

The contracts may be suitable for a portion of the asset portfolio for those who want to avoid risk and are in retirement or nearing retirement age.  The objective of purchasing an equity index annuity is to realize greater gains than those provided by CDs, money markets or bonds, while still protecting principal. The long term ability of Equity Index Annuities to beat the returns of other fixed instruments is a matter of debate.

Indexed annuities represent about 30% of all fixed annuity sales in 2006 according to the Advantage Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indexannuity.org Index Annuity]&lt;/ref&gt;

Equity-indexed annuities may also be referred to as fixed indexed annuities or simple indexed annuities. The mechanics of equity-indexed annuities are often complex and the returns can vary greatly depending on the month and year the annuity is purchased. Like many other types of annuities, equity-indexed annuities usually carry a surrender charge for early withdrawal. These "surrender periods" range between 3 and 16 years; typically, about ten.

See [[Indexed annuity]]

==A different way to credit interest==
The indexed annuity is virtually identical to a fixed annuity except in the way interest is calculated. As an example, consider a $100,000 fixed annuity that credits a 4% annual effective interest rate. The owner receives an interest credit of $4,000.  However, in an equity-indexed annuity, the interest credit is linked to the equity markets. For example: Assume the index is the S&amp;P 500, a one-year point-to-point method is used, and the annuity has an 8% cap. The $100,000 annuity could credit anything between 0% and 8% based on the change in the S&amp;P 500. The cap, 8% in this example, is determined by how much is afforded by budget which is usually at or near the 4% fixed rate. If fixed rates increase, it would be expected that the cap would increase as well.

This allows the owner the security of knowing that the $100,000 is safe but rather than receiving the sure 4% they can receive up to 8%.  Historically since 1950, an 8% cap on the S&amp;P 500 has resulted in an average interest credit of 5.2%, very similar to what is considered the "risk free rate of return" delivered by T-bills, 5.1% over a similar period. The return may also be adjusted by other factors such as the participation rate and market value adjustments to cover bring the cost of the option into the budget available.   

This means the owner of the indexed annuity now has assumed more risk than a fixed annuity but less than being in the equity markets themselves. The result is that the expected yield (risk adjusted) for an indexed annuity is higher than a fixed annuity, CD, etc. However, the expected yield of being in the market is higher for several reasons.  

The principal (in our example the $100,000) is at risk of loss when owning the index outright. Equity Index Annuity does not participate in dividends as owning the index outright would and similar there are no ongoing transaction expenses or fees. Interest is compounded as frequently as when interest is credited and this is almost always annually but contracts are available that credit interest over a 5-year term.

The taxation of the gains in an indexed annuity is identical to that of fixed annuities.  Taxes are deferred until monies are received and then interest is withdrawn first and taxed as ordinary income.  If the index was owned outright, gains would not be tax deferred, but may qualify for the more favorable capital gains tax rate.

==Understanding options==
This way of linking to an equity index like the S&amp;P 500 or Dow Jones is accomplished through an option, usually a call option. A call option is the right- but not the obligation- to purchase something at a future date for a specified price.

The naming convention for options used by the insurance industry is different from that of Wall Street, but the options are structurally identical. Here's a sample of options commonly seen in indexed annuities:

*[[Insurance]] vs. [[Wall Street]]
*[[Market-linked CD#Point-to-point|Point-to-Point]] vs. European
*Monthly Average vs. Asian
*Monthly Point-to-Point vs. Cliquet
*Performance Triggered vs. Binary

The options in indexed annuities can usually be fit into the following taxonomy developed by the National Association of Fixed Annuities.

''Term'' - the length of time before option matures, usually one year.  Two, three, four, and ten are also prevalent in the market.  Some longer term options are but have a "highwater" feature that allows interest to be credited more frequently.  An example of this would be a ten-year Monthly Average option that credits interest each year if there is a gain.

''Index'' - the equity, stock, bond, or other index to which the interest credit is linked.

''Gain formula'' - the method used to determine the gain in the index.  Point to point, monthly averaging, daily averaging are the most common methods of calculating the gain.  For example, of the S&amp;P 500 index starts at 1120 and ends at 1300 then the point to point gain is 16.07%.

''Adjustment method'' - the way the option is limited in order to reduce the cost (and subsequent return) so that it becomes affordable.  As an example the point to point option may cost 7% of the account value but will be "adjusted" to reduce the cost.

"Market value adjustment" - the company may reserve the right to adjust the value of your account based on current market conditions.  This adjustment is most often applied to distributions, partial or complete withdrawals, and exchanges to other accounts.  

The most common adjustments are cap, fee, participation rate or a combination of the three. Other adjustments are less common. In keeping with the preceding example and allowing for an 8% cap as the adjustment the policyholder would not receive the 16.07% point-to-point gain, but rather 8% as an interest credit.

Should provide examples for:
P2P with Participation Rate
Monthly Averaging with Cap
Monthly Averaging with Fee

Should also link to the withdrawal benefits provided in variable annuities and indexed annuities at this point.  These concepts were added because of the risk associated with the accumulation in both variable annuities and indexed annuities.

== US Taxation ==

While the taxes on gains are deferred, earnings are taxed at an individual's ordinary income tax rate as opposed to capital gains and qualified  stock dividends which are tax at lower capital gains rates. Also annuities do not qualify for a step in basis at the owner's death while most stock, bond and real estate investments are. Any earnings will be tax at the beneficiary's ordinary [[Income tax in the United States|income tax rate]]. &lt;ref&gt; https://www.cnbc.com/id/101239958 &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Communities Act 1972''' (No. 27 of 1972) is an [[Act of Parliament|act]] of the Irish parliament, the [[Oireachtas]], that incorporates the [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]] and [[law of the European Union]] into the domestic law of the [[Ireland]]. The Act did not just incorporate the law of the [[European Communities]] which existed at the time of its enactment, but incorporates legislative acts of the Community enacted subsequently. The Act also provides that government ministers may adopt [[statutory instrument]]s (SIs) to implement EU law, and that those SIs are to have effect as if they were acts of parliament.

Doing either of these things would normally count as an unconstitutional delegation of the legislative power of the state. However this problem was anticipated by the adoption of the [[Third Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] which protects any legislation that is necessitated by the obligations of membership of the European Union.

The constitutionality of the Act's provisions regarding statutory instruments was challenged in ''Meagher v Minister for Agriculture'' on the basis that they were an unlawful delegation of legislative power by the Oireachtas. The plaintiff was successful in the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] but the decision was reversed on appeal to the [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]]. The Court ruled that:

:"The court is satisfied that, having regard to the number of community laws, acts done and measures adopted which either have to be facilitated in their direct application to the law of the State or have to be implemented by appropriate action into the law of the State, the obligation of membership would necessitate facilitating of these activities, in some instances, at least, and possibly in a great majority of instances, by the making of ministerial regulations rather than legislation of the Oireachtas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Meagher v Minister for Agriculture |court=IEHC |year=1993 |num=2 |para=17 |parallelcite=[1994] 1 IR 329 |date=18 November 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It took the form of a religious [[oath]] made by the accused prior to questioning by the [[Star Chamber]], to answer truthfully all questions that might be asked.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} It gave rise to what became known as the '''cruel [[trilemma]]'''&lt;ref name="rubenfeld"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubenfeld|first=Jed|title=Revolution by Judiciary: the structure of American constitutional law|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn= 978-0-674-01715-3 |pages=33–35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4slwLg-8VLcC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%22cruel+trilemma%22+oath&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dZYPTNWGMdiK_Ab-7rjSDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cruel%20trilemma%22%20oath&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the accused would find themselves trapped between a breach of religious oath (taken extremely seriously in that era, a [[mortal sin]],&lt;ref name="rubenfeld" /&gt; and [[perjury]]), [[contempt of court]] for silence, or self-incrimination. The name derives from the questioner putting the accused on oath ''[[ex officio]]'', meaning by virtue of his office or position.

Outcry against this practice (particularly in the trials of [[John Lilburne]] ("Freeborn John") around 1630–1649) led to the establishment of the right to not incriminate oneself in [[common law]]. This was the direct precursor of similar [[civil rights|rights]] in modern law, including the [[right to silence]] and non-self-incrimination in the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The right itself appears as item 16 in the [[Levellers]] ''[[Agreement of the People|Agreement of the Free People of England]]'' (1649)&lt;ref name="levellers"&gt;{{cite book|last=John Lilburne|title=[[Agreement of the People|An Agreement of the Free People of England]]|date=1 May 1649|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and first appeared in US law in the [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] and the [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|Connecticut Code]] of the same era. The Star Chamber itself, as a judicial body, was abolished by [[Parliament]] as part of the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]].

== Privilege against self-incrimination ==
Early examples of a codified right appears in the [[Levellers]] manifesto ''[[Agreement of the People|Agreement of the Free People of England]]'' (published 1 May 1649): "[I]t shall not be in the power of any Representative, to punish, or cause to be punished, any person or persons for refusing to answer questions against themselves in Criminall cases".&lt;ref name="levellers" /&gt;

The right first appeared in US law in the [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] and the [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|Connecticut Code]] of the same era.

The [[United States Supreme Court]] summarized the events of the time as part of the historical background in the landmark case ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'':
{{quote|Perhaps the critical historical event shedding light on its [ie, the privilege against self-incrimination] origins and evolution was the trial of one John Lilburn, a vocal anti-Stuart Leveller, who was made to take the Star Chamber Oath in 1637. The oath would have bound him to answer to all questions posed to him on any subject. He resisted the oath and declaimed the proceedings, stating: ''"Another fundamental right I then contended for, was, that no man's conscience ought to be racked by oaths imposed, to answer to questions concerning himself in matters criminal, or pretended to be so."''

On account of the Lilburn Trial, Parliament abolished the inquisitorial Court of Star Chamber and went further in giving him generous reparation. The lofty principles to which Lilburn had appealed during his trial gained popular acceptance in England. These sentiments worked their way over to the Colonies and were implanted after great struggle into the Bill of Rights.&lt;ref name="miranda"&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=384&amp;invol=436#f29 Text of the Miranda v.

'''Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)''' is a [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) model of fire-driven fluid flow. The computer program solves numerically a [[large eddy simulation]] form of the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] appropriate for low-speed, thermally-driven flow, with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires, to describe the evolution of fire.

FDS is free software developed by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) of the [[United States Department of Commerce]], in cooperation with [[VTT]] Technical Research Centre of Finland. Smokeview is the companion visualization program that can be used to display the output of FDS.

The first version of FDS was publicly released in February 2000. To date, about half of the applications of the model have been for design of smoke handling systems and sprinkler/detector activation studies. The other half consist of residential and industrial fire reconstructions. Throughout its development, FDS has been aimed at solving practical fire problems in fire protection engineering, while at the same time providing a tool to study fundamental fire dynamics and combustion.

The [[Wildland–urban interface|Wildland-Urban]] Fire Dynamics Simulator (WFDS) is an extension developed by the [[US Forest Service]] that is integrated into FDS and allows it to be used for [[wildfire modeling]]. It models vegetative fuel either by explicitly defining the volume of the vegetation or, for surface fuels such as grass, by assuming uniform fuel at the air-ground boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/fera/wfds/index.shtml|title=PNW - Fire and Environmental Research Applications Team (FERA) Research/Studies|author=Ellen Eberhardt|work=fs.fed.us|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FDS is a Fortran program that reads input parameters from a text file, computes a numerical solution to the governing equations, and writes user-specified output data to files. Smokeview is a companion program that reads FDS output files and produces animations on the computer screen. Smokeview has a simple menu-driven interface, while FDS does not. However, there are various third-party programs that have been developed to generate the text file containing the input parameters needed by FDS.

'''''Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others''''' is one of [[New Zealand]]'s leading constitutional law decisions. Heard in the [[High Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]] in 1976, the decision considered whether press statements by the [[Prime Minister]] [[Robert Muldoon]] had breached section 1 of the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights 1688]], "That the pretended power of suspending of laws, or the execution of laws, by regal authority, without consent of [[Parliament]], is illegal".&lt;ref&gt;Bill of Rights 1688, section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Third Labour Government of New Zealand|Third Labour Government]] had passed the [[New Zealand Superannuation Act]] 1974 requiring employees and employers to make matching compulsory contributions to a superannuation fund from 1 April 1975. This was to be administered by the Superannuation Board.&lt;ref&gt;''Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others'' [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 616.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[David Vernon Williams|David Williams]] noted, "[[The National Party]], then in opposition, used all possible parliamentary devices to oppose this legislation and promised to repeal it immediately the Party gained office again. The general election campaign in 1975 had featured an acrimonious debate over the merits of the rival Labour and National superannuation policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MonashULawRw/1977/3.pdf|title = TO REMIND PEOPLE OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS 1688|last = Williams|first = David|date = June 1977|journal = Monash University Law Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Party had suggested in its election campaign, and specifically in the [[Dancing Cossacks advertisement]], that the superannuation scheme would have the effect of leading to Soviet-style communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/video/dancing-cossacks|title = Dancing Cossacks political TV ad|date = 10 June 2014|accessdate = 7 April 2015|website = NZ History|publisher = Ministry for Culture and Heritage|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A general election was held on 29 November 1975, at which the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] was voted out of government and on 12 December 1975 the [[Third National Government of New Zealand|Third National Government]] was formed with [[Robert Muldoon]] sworn in as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;''Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others'' [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 616.&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December, the Prime Minister, who was also [[Minister of Finance]], issued a press statement declaring,

{{quote|The Prime Minister, Hon R D Muldoon, today issued a statement on the future of the New Zealand Superannuation scheme. This was to give effect to National's election policy to abolish the scheme and refund all contributions to employees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Muldoon said that early in the next Parliamentary session legislation would be introduced to carry out the government's election promises relating to the [[New Zealand Superannuation Scheme]]. In particular the compulsory element in the law would be removed with retrospective effect.

The compulsory requirement for employee deductions to the New Zealand scheme will cease for pay periods ending after this date. Mr Muldoon said that he recognised that because of arrangements made for payment of wages and salaries in advance through computer systems or by other means, deductions would in some cases continue for limited periods. All deductions and contributions, including any which may be made from now until 31 March 1976, will be returned to employees through the income tax refund system or could be transferred to another scheme.

Similarly the compulsory requirement for employer contributions will cease as from today in respect of salaries or wages paid from now on.|author=[[Robert Muldoon]]|source=Press statement on 15 December 1975&lt;ref&gt;''Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others'' [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 616-7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Muldoon 26 June 1969.jpg|alt= Robert Muldoon, pictured in 1969.|thumb|Robert Muldoon, pictured in 1969.]]
On 23 December, Prime Minister Muldoon issued another press release,

{{quote|Regardless of what any union groups might represent or how some employers might see the position, no employees would receive the benefit of employer contributions made to the New Zealand Superannuation Fund after December 15, said the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, [[Mr Muldoon]], today.

Mr Muldoon said the government had already made it clear that the superannuation scheme finished on December 15 and the compulsory requirement for employee deductions and employer contributions ceased for pay periods ending after that date. Empowering legislation, with retrospective effect, would be introduced early in the 1976 Parliamentary session.|author=[[Robert Muldoon]]
|source=Press statement on 23 December 1975&lt;ref&gt;''Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others'' [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 617.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[plaintiff]], [[Mr FitzGerald]], had worked as a public servant since 3 June 1975 and he stated in his affidavit that he had since the beginning of his employment with the Crown, contributed at a rate of one percent of his earnings, amounting to $2.08 a fortnight. He further deposed that the Crown had been deducting this from his gross earnings and transferring this into the fund along with their contribution, until the pay period ending on 24 December 1975.&lt;ref&gt;''Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others'' [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 618.&lt;/ref&gt;

FitzGerald sued the Prime Minister, as first defendant, and named the chairman and eight other members of the [[Superannuation Board]] as second defendant, the Attorney-General (in respect of the Treasury and Department of Education) as third defendant and the Controller and Auditor-General as fourth defendant.&lt;ref&gt;''Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others'' [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 618.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wild CJ summarised FitzGerald's case as being that the Prime Minister had, in contravention of the Bill of Rights 1688, section 1, made an announcement that constituted exercising a pretended power to suspend a properly made law, the Superannuation Act 1974.&lt;ref&gt;''Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others'' [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 618.&lt;/ref&gt; FitzGerald sought a declaration that the announcement and instructions issued by the Prime Minister on 15 December 1975 amounted to a breach of section 1 of the Bill of Rights 1688 and also injunctions requiring the withdrawal of the instruction and restraining the Prime Minister from further instructions to the Superannuation Board. A range of other declarations and injunctions was sought against the other defendants for their participation in the suspension of the superannuation scheme.&lt;ref&gt;''Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others'' [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 619.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
In his judgment Wild CJ surveyed the evidence of four public officials: [[Arnold Nordmeyer|Sir Arnold Nordmeyer]], Chairman of the Superannuation Board; a Mr Kelly, assistant commissioner of the [[State Services Commission]]; the chief accountant of the [[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue Department]]; and the general manager of the [[Superannuation Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others'' [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 619.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
[[File:English Bill of Rights of 1689 (top).jpg|alt= A close up of the Bill of Rights, 1688.|thumb|Wild CJ declared that Muldoon was purporting to suspend a law of Parliament by regal authority in contravention of the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights, 1688]].]]
[[Chief Justice]] [[Richard Wild (judge)|Wild]] decided in favour of the plaintiff on one issue, that the Prime Minister's purported suspension of the operation of the New Zealand Superannuation Act 1975, "was illegal as being in breach of s&amp;nbsp;1 of the Bill of Rights, and that the plaintiff is entitled to a declaration to that effect".&lt;ref&gt;''Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others'' [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 623.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The first sentence of the third paragraph, however, and the fourth paragraph [of the 15 December statement], amount together to an unequivocal pronouncement that the compulsory requirement for employee deductions and employer contributions were to cease as stated. That was reiterated in unmistakable terms in the second paragraph of the statement made on 23 December. The Act of Parliament in force required that those deductions and contributions must be made, yet here was the Prime Minister announcing that they need not be made. I am bound to hold that in so doing he was purporting to suspend the law without consent of Parliament. Parliament had made the law. Therefore the law could be amended or suspended only by Parliament or with the authority of Parliament.|author=[[Richard Wild (judge)|Wild CJ]]
|source=''Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others''&lt;ref&gt;''Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others'' [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 622.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Wild CJ]] also held that whether the meaning of "by regal authority" included the Prime Minister's statement was {{quote|to be determined by reference to the powers of the Prime Minister and the position occupied by him, which are of fundamental importance in our system of government. He is the Prime Minister, the leader of the government elected to office, the chief of the executive government. He had lately received his commission by royal authority, taken the oaths of office, and entered on his duties. In my opinion his public announcement of 15 December, made as it was in the course of his official duties as Prime Minister, must therefore be regarded as made "by regal authority" within the meaning of s 1.|author=[[Richard Wild (judge)|Wild CJ]]
|source=''Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others''&lt;ref&gt;''Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others'' [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 622.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wild CJ found against the plaintiff that the evidence disclosed that there had been no instructions by the Prime Minister to any members of the Superannuation Board, any government department or arm of state services.&lt;ref&gt;''Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others'' [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 622.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because there was a high probability that the New Zealand Superannuation Act 1974 would be repealed and the scheme dismantled in the months following the hearing, Wild CJ adjourned all other matters for six months, satisfied that, "In my opinion, the law and the authority of Parliament will be vindicated by the making of the declaration I have indicated".&lt;ref&gt;''Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others'' [1976] 2 NZLR 615 at 623.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Franchise and Ballot Act''' (1892) was an act of the [[Cape Colony]] Parliament, driven by Prime Minister [[Cecil Rhodes]], which raised the property franchise qualification, thus disenfranchising a large proportion of the Cape's non-white voters, and a number of poor white voters.

It was a significant early step in overturning the Cape's liberal and multi-racial constitution. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/216601/Franchise-and-Ballot-Act&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sahistory.org.za/liberation-struggle-south-africa/constructing-union-south-africa-negotiations-and-contestations-1902&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Cape Colony]] had a system of franchise that was open to men of all races, dating back to its early constitution in 1853 and its achievement of "[[Responsible Government]]" in 1872. Under this system, the right to vote was based on £25 property franchise regardless of race.

In the ensuing decade, increasing numbers of the Cape's Black African citizens became politically active. By the 1880s, the Cape's Prime Minister [[Cecil Rhodes]] was disturbed by the prospect that white politicians may eventually be sidelined in many Cape Constituencies where non-white voters formed a majority. As more and more African citizens exercised their right to vote under the law as it existed, their vote looked to soon be decisive. 

The Cape Colony was also unique of all the countries in [[southern Africa]] for its multi-racial franchise. At this time in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] and the [[Orange Free State]] indigenous Africans had no voting rights, and in [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] very few non-whites had the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv01538/04lv01646/05lv01703.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immediate effects of the act==
The Cape Colony's '''Franchise and Ballot Act''' of 1892 raised the franchise qualifications from £25 to £75, which effectively disenfranchised non-whites in significant enough numbers to make their voting powers negligible, although a proportion of poor whites were disenfranchised too.

==Long-term effects==
This legislation settled the disputes as to whether non-whites had voting power in Cape Colony in the late 19th century, and is recognized as being an early example of legislation motivated by racial discrimination, although the law itself achieved its racially discriminatory aims only indirectly, through financially based clauses.&lt;ref&gt;http://newhistory.co.za/Part-3-Chapter-12-Economic-woes-and-political-reaction-Curbing-the-Black-franchise-Attempting-to-justify-disenfranchisement/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GPRRAMKearney.jpg|300px|right|thumb|The Archway]]
The '''Archway''' (also known as '''The Great Platte River Road Archway''' or '''Kearney Arch''') is a museum of and monument to [[Nebraska]]'s and the [[Platte River]] valley's role in [[westward expansion]]. The Archway is directly over [[Interstate 80 in Nebraska|Interstate 80]] three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) east of [[Kearney, Nebraska]].

==About==
The Archway spans more than 300 feet over Interstate 80 east of Kearney, Nebraska and weighs nearly 1,500 tons.&lt;ref name="aboutarchway"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/9790 |title=The Archway |publisher=RoadsideAmerica.com |date=8 April 2014 |accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Archway takes visitors along the trails, rails, highways and superhighways in a self-guided audio tour that includes stories of the travelers along the way.&lt;ref name="aboutarchway"/&gt; The show starts in the 1840s with the [[Mormon Trail]], [[Oregon Trail]] and [[California Trail]] that converged at the nearby Fort Kearny before heading west. As visitors progress through the exhibit, the displays of different time periods feature a buffalo stampede, the [[Mormon Handcart Expedition]], gold seekers, the [[Pony Express]], the telegraph, the [[transcontinental railroad]], the [[Lincoln Highway]], a drive-in movie and a 1950s cafe.&lt;ref name="aboutarchway"/&gt; A new exit (Exit 275) immediately east of The Archway provides easy access. Exit 272 (to Kearney) also provides access to The Archway.

==History==
A monument and tourist attraction highlighting the Platte River valley was a goal of former [[Governor of Nebraska|Governor]] [[Frank B. Morrison]].  In 1997, $60 million in bonds were issued and purchased by investors.  On 16 July 2000, the Archway opened to the public, with 223,013 and 249,174 visitors in the attraction's first two years, respectively.  First-year visitors included then-[[President of the United States|president]] [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name="omabankruptcy"/&gt;  These numbers were far short of projections. The monument had to reduce expenses and refinance its bond payments in 2002, reducing the amount owed to $22 million, repaid by 2013.&lt;ref name="bankruptcyfiled"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalstar.com/business/local/kearney-arch-files-for-bankruptcy/article_83dc2b97-76b5-5862-8506-b5da06056ecb.html |title=Kearney Arch files for bankruptcy |publisher=[[Lincoln Journal-Star]] |date=6 March 2013 |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a shift in focus on educational and group tours briefly presented the monument with a more stable financial footing, attendance subsequently dwindled, counting only 49,960 visitors in 2012.&lt;ref name="omabankruptcy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20130306/NEWS/130309740 |title=Kearney Arch files for bankruptcy protection |publisher=[[Omaha World Herald]] |author1=Joseph Brennan |author2=Mike Konz |date=7 March 2013 |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Archway filed for bankruptcy protection on March 7, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Platte River Road Memorial Archway|url=http://www.kearneyhub.com/great-platte-river-road-memorial-archway/image_59fe3280-8752-11e2-82d7-001a4bcf887a.html|publisher=Kearney Hub|accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2013, U.S. federal bankruptcy judge [[Thomas Saladino]] approved a debt plan, ordering museum organizers to pay $100,000 as a settlement for more than $20 million it owed to bondholders, creditors and vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/nebraska/judge-approves-debt-plan-for-kearney-archway/article_11eff237-f010-5e53-b9dd-357cb90b5771.html |title=Judge approves debt plan for Kearney archway |publisher=[[Lincoln Journal-Star]] |date=19 September 2013 |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="omaplan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20130918/NEWS/130918586 |title=Kearney Arch bankruptcy plan wins approval; attraction may remain open |publisher=[[Omaha World Herald]] |author1=Joe Duggan |author2=Mike Konz |date=19 September 2013 |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wells Fargo]] Bank of Minneapolis was the trustee for the bondholders.

As part of the resolution of the bankruptcy filing, The Archway is managed by the City of Kearney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=County Kearney Give Archway Second Chance|url=http://www.kearneyhub.com/news/local/county-kearney-give-archway-second-chance/article_884cdede-628f-11e3-8fb6-0019bb2963f4.html|publisher=Kearney Hub|accessdate=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second I-80 interchange was completed in August 2013 directly east of the museum at a cost of about $20 million, and is expected to boost attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1011now.com/centralnebraska/home/headlines/New-Exit-Boosts-Business-For-Archway-223548541.html |title=New Exit Boosts Business For Kearney Archway |author=Cassandra Hager |publisher=[[KGIN]] |date=12 September 2013 |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, eastbound motorists who missed the exit two miles west of the museum needed to travel 12 additional miles to get to the Archway.&lt;ref name="omabankruptcy"/&gt;  The lack of such an exit had been long blamed for part of the Archway's troubles.&lt;ref name="omaplan"/&gt;

The '''Hamas Covenant''' or '''Hamas Charter''', formally known in English as the '''Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement''', was originally issued on 18 August 1988 and outlines the founding identity, stand, and aims of [[Hamas]] (the Islamic Resistance Movement).&lt;ref name="avalon"/&gt; A new charter was issued by Hamas leader [[Khaled Mashal]] on 1 May 2017 in [[Doha]].&lt;ref name=CNNqiblawi&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/01/middleeast/hamas-charter-palestinian-israeli/|title=Hamas says it accepts '67 borders, but doesn't recognize Israel|publisher=CNN|author1=Tamara Qiblawi|author2= Angela Dewan|author3= Larry Register|date=1 May 2017|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Charter identified Hamas as the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine and declares its members to be Muslims who "fear God and raise the banner of Jihad in the face of the oppressors." The charter states that "our struggle against the Jews is very great and very serious" and calls for the eventual creation of an Islamic state in Palestine, in place of Israel and the Palestinian Territories,&lt;ref&gt;

The charter also states that Hamas is humanistic, and tolerant of other religions as long as they "stop disputing the sovereignty of Islam in this region".&lt;ref&gt;

In 2008, the Hamas leader in Gaza, [[Ismail Haniyeh]], stated that Hamas would agree to accept a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders, and to offer a long-term truce with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.haaretz.com/news/haniyeh-hamas-willing-to-accept-palestinian-state-with-1967-borders-1.256915 Haniyeh: Hamas willing to accept Palestinian state with 1967 borders]". ''Haaretz''. (09-11-08) Retrieved 27 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to this, Hamas leader [[Mahmoud al-Zahar]] stated that any talk of the 1967 lines is "just a phase" until Hamas has a chance to "regain the land...even if we [Hamas] have to do so inch by inch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hamas Leader Mahmoud Al-Zahhar Slams PA President Abbas for "Aimless Kangaroo-Like" Political Gymnastics and Says: We Will Not Relinquish Any Piece of Palestinian Land|url=http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/3051.htm|website=Memri TV|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Hamas leaders, including Ismail Haniyah and [[Khaled Meshaal]], have also stated repeatedly that "Palestine – from the [Jordan] River to the [Mediterranean] Sea, from its north to its south – is our land, our right, and our homeland. There will be no relinquishing or forsaking even an inch or small part of it,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hamas Leader Khaled Mash'al: We Will Not Relinquish an Inch of Palestine, from the River to the Sea |url= http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/3671.htm|website=Memri TV|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "we shall not relinquish the Islamic [[waqf]] on the land of Palestine, and Jerusalem shall not be divided into Western and Eastern Jerusalem.

In 2009 interviews with the BBC, [[Tony Blair]] claimed that Hamas does not accept the existence of Israel and continues to pursue its objectives through terror and violence; [[Sir Jeremy Greenstock]] however argued that Hamas has not adopted its charter as part of its political program since it won the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006]].&lt;ref name ="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead it has moved to a more secular stance.&lt;ref name="new hamas"/&gt; In 2010, Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal stated that the Charter is "a piece of history and no longer relevant, but cannot be changed for internal reasons."&lt;ref name="wrmea.com"&gt;[http://www.wrmea.com/component/content/article/351-2010-may-june/9051-mazin-qumsiyeh-on-the-history-and-practice-of-nonviolent-palestinian-resistance-.html Mazin Qumsiyeh on the History and Practice Of Nonviolent Palestinian Resistance]

After a new charter was scheduled to be issued in May 2017, [[Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s office issued a statement in which it accused Hamas of trying to fool the world and also asked it to stop its terror activities for a true change.&lt;ref&gt;

The 2017 charter accepted for the first time the idea of a Palestinian state within the borders that existed [[Green Line (Israel)|before 1967]] and rejects recognition of Israel which it terms as the "Zionist enemy".&lt;ref name=CNNqiblawi/&gt; It advocates such a state as transitional but also advocates "liberation of all of Palestine".&lt;ref name=Mughrabi&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-hamas-document-idUSKBN17X1N8|title=Hamas softens stance on Israel, drops Muslim Brotherhood link|publisher=Reuters|author1=Nidal al-Mughrabi|author2= Tom Finn|date=2 May 2017|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/hamas-accepts-palestinian-state-1967-borders-170501114309725.html|title=Hamas accepts Palestinian state with 1967 borders|publisher=Al-Jazeera|date=2 May 2017|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new document also states that the group doesn't seek war with the [[Jewish people]] but only against Zionism which it holds responsible for "occupation of Palestine".&lt;ref name=GuardianWintour&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/01/hamas-new-charter-palestine-israel-1967-borders|title=Hamas presents new charter accepting a Palestine based on 1967 borders|publisher=The Guardian|author=Patrick Wintour|date=2 May 2017|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mashal also stated that Hamas was ending its association with the [[Muslim Brotherhood]].&lt;ref name=Mughrabi/&gt;

==Background==
In 1987, twenty years after the 1967 war, the [[First Intifada]] (1987–1993) began.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7381369.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Middle East - 1987: First Intifada|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s, the PLO sought a negotiated solution with Israel in the form of a two-state solution. This was not acceptable to Hamas, the [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] wing of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]],&lt;ref name="Holtmann" /&gt; and the covenant was written to bridge the ideological gap between the PLO and Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;ref name="Mishal" /&gt;  According to Hamas's Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. [[Ahmed Yousef]], the Charter "was ratified during the unique circumstances of the Uprising in 1988 as a necessary framework for dealing with a relentless occupation".&lt;ref name=Yousef&gt;[http://www.palestinechronicle.com/hamas-charter-vision-fact-and-fiction Hamas Charter: Vision, Fact and Fiction] Palestine Chronicle (23 January 2011)Retrieved 27 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

While the PLO was nationalistic, it was more secular in nature, while Hamas subscribed to a neo-[[Salafi]] jihadi theology and nationalism.&lt;ref name="Holtmann"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UBfHsIlcQE8C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=hamas+charter&amp;ei=jFspTOn0OYy6yQTn7d3kCg&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  The PLO Charters of 1964 and 1968 and the Hamas Charter of 1988] By Philipp Holtmann&lt;/ref&gt;  Hamas was a shift from the Muslim Brotherhood's more universal Islamic vision to a focus on Palestinian nationalism and a strategy of armed struggle, or violent [[jihad]].&lt;ref name="Mishal"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AO-tZkbPDKYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=hamas+charter&amp;ei=x1spTPKYCJ6GygTO8OWLCg&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=hamas%20covenant&amp;f=false ''The Palestinian Hamas: vision, violence, and coexistence''] Shaul Mishal, Avraham Sela.&lt;/ref&gt; Its political goals were identical to those of the PLO's charter and was essentially an armed struggle to retrieve the entire land of [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] as an Islamic [[waqf]].&lt;ref name="Mishal" /&gt;

The movement later came under pressure to update its founding charter issued in 1988 which called for Israel's destruction and advocated violent means for achieving a Palestinian state.&lt;ref name=CNNqiblawi/&gt; The original charter's tone and casting the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as part of an eternal struggle between Muslim and Jews became an obstacle for the movement to be able to take part in diplomatic forums involving Western nations. The new charter also sought to question the ability of [[Fatah]] and its leader [[Mahmoud Abbas]] to act as the sole legitimate representative for the Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/the-new-hamas-charter-explained-20170502-gvx10t.html|title=The new Hamas charter explained|author=Maher Mughrabi|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, its ties to the Muslim Brotherhood had also damaged relationship with [[Egypt]] which considers the movement to be a terrorist organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-hamas-document-idUSKBN17X1N8?il=0|title=Hamas softens stance on Israel, drops Muslim Brotherhood link|author1=Nidal al-Mughrabi|author2= Tom Finn|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance of the Charter in the 21st century==
Dr. Ahmed Yousef, an adviser to [[Ismail Haniyeh]] (the senior political leader of [[Hamas]]), claimed that Hamas has changed its views over time since the charter was issued in 1988.&lt;ref name=Yousef/&gt; In 2010 Hamas leader [[Khaled Meshaal]] stated that the Charter is "a piece of history and no longer relevant, but cannot be changed for internal reasons."&lt;ref name="wrmea.com"/&gt;

In 2006, Hamas proposed government programme, which stated that "the question of recognizing Israel is not the jurisdiction of one faction, nor the government, but a decision for the Palestinian people."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lebanonwire.com/0603MLN/06031214MAF.asp Israel's Likud, Hamas square off over future relations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127031443/http://lebanonwire.com/0603MLN/06031214MAF.asp |date=27 November 2011 }}(12 March 2006)Retrieved 31 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However many remain sceptical of Hamas's new stance, and view it as a ploy to hide its true agenda, "but it is equally true that the "new" discourse of diluted religious content—to say nothing of the movement's increasing pragmatism and flexibility in the political domain—reflects genuine and cumulative changes within Hamas."&lt;ref name="new hamas"/&gt;

Contrastingly, Mahmoud Zahar, co-founder of Hamas, said in 2006 that Hamas "will not change a single word in its covenant." In 2010, he reaffirmed a major commitment of the covenant saying "Our ultimate plan is [to have] Palestine in its entirety. I say this loud and clear so that nobody will accuse me of employing political tactics. We will not recognize the Israeli enemy."&lt;ref name=Goldberg2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldberg |first1=Jeffrey |title=What Would Hamas Do If It Could Do Whatever It Wanted?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/what-would-hamas-do-if-it-could-do-whatever-it-wanted/375545/|publisher=The Atlantic |accessdate=3 May 2017|date=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Atallah Abu al-Subh, the former Hamas minister of culture, said that "the Jews are the most despicable and contemptible nation to crawl upon the face of the [[Earth]], because they have displayed hostility to [[Allah]]. [[God in Islam|Allah]] will kill the Jews in the hell of the world to come, just like they killed the believers in the hell of this world."&lt;ref name=Goldberg2014/&gt;

Per [[Nathan Thrall]], an analyst working for the [[International Crisis Group]], the original charter had been a long source of embarrassment among the reformists in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/world/middleeast/hamas-khaled-meshal-gaza.html|title=Hamas Leader Plays Final Hand: Trying to Lift Group's Pariah Status|publisher=The New York Times|author=Declan Walsh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Statements about Israel====

The Preamble to the Charter states: ″Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam invalidates it, just as it invalidated others before it″.

==Anti-Semitism==
===Ideology===
According to [[Abraham Foxman]] of the [[Anti-Defamation League]], "The Hamas credo is not just anti-Israel, but profoundly anti-Semitic with racism at its core. The Hamas Charter reads like a modern-day ''Mein Kampf''." According to the charter, Jewish people "have only negative traits and are presented as planning to take over the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/IslME_62/4877_62.htm] Anti-Semitism at Core of Hamas Charter. ADL Retrieved 27 May 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525133139/http://www.adl.org/PresRele/IslME_62/4877_62.htm |date=25 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The charter claims that the Jews deserve God's/Allah's enmity and wrath because they received the Scriptures but violated its sacred texts, disbelieved the signs of Allah, and slew their own prophets.&lt;ref name="Schenker"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=tecKLb2jIPoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=hamas+charter+antisemitic&amp;ots=lOZnTujlyK&amp;sig=L3aaqR8kjuKixqin4b1BE3mCf6k#v=onepage&amp;q=charter&amp;f=false ''The Anti-Semitism of Hamas'' by Meir Litvak] in ''Islamophobia and anti-Semitism'' pg 87&lt;/ref&gt; It quotes a saying of Muhammad from a [[hadith]]:

{{quote|The Day of Judgment will not come until Muslims fight the Jews, when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say, 'O Muslim, O servant of God, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.' Only the Gharkad tree would not do that, because it is one of the trees of the Jews.|Related by [[al-Bukhari]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Muslim]].&lt;ref name=avalon/&gt;}}

===Militant Jihad===
The charter goes further in detailing how Jihad against the Jews is a duty. "The day that enemies usurp part of Moslem land, Jihad becomes the individual duty of every Moslem. In face of the Jews' usurpation of Palestine, it is compulsory that the banner of Jihad be raised. To do this requires the diffusion of Islamic consciousness among the masses, both on the regional, Arab and Islamic levels. It is necessary to instill the spirit of Jihad in the heart of the nation so that they would confront the enemies and join the ranks of the fighters."&lt;ref name=avalon/&gt;

===Anti-semitic canards===
The charter contains references to [[anti-Semitic canards]], such as the assertion that through shrewd manipulation of imperial countries and secret societies, Jews were behind a wide range of events and disasters going as far back in history as the [[French Revolution]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;With their money, they took control of the world media, news agencies, the press, publishing houses, broadcasting stations, and others. With their money they stirred revolutions in various parts of the world with the purpose of achieving their interests and reaping the fruit therein. They were behind the French Revolution, the Communist revolution and most of the revolutions we heard and hear about, here and there. With their money, they formed secret societies, such as Freemason, Rotary Clubs, the Lions and others in different parts of the world for the purpose of sabotaging societies and achieving Zionist interests. With their money they were able to control imperialistic countries and instigate them to colonize many countries in order to enable them to exploit their resources and spread corruption there.&lt;ref name=avalon/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It continues by accusing the Jews of engineering World War I and it echoes Nazi propaganda in claiming that Jews profited during World War II.&lt;ref name=Herf&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herf|first1=Jeffrey |title=Why They Fight: Hamas' Too-Little-Known Fascist Charter|url=https://www.the-american-interest.com/2014/08/01/why-they-fight-hamas-too-little-known-fascist-charter/|publisher=The American Interest |accessdate=3 May 2017|date=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence against Jews===
The document also quotes Islamic religious texts to provide justification for fighting against and killing the Jews, without distinction of whether they are in Israel or elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/www.thejerusalemfund.org/carryover/documents/charter.html Hamas Charter (1988)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111122811/http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/www.thejerusalemfund.org/carryover/documents/charter.html |date=11 November 2010 }}. Retrieved 27 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It presents the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] as an inherently irreconcilable struggle between Jews and Muslims, and Judaism and Islam, adding that the only way to engage in this struggle between "truth and falsehood" is through Islam and by means of [[jihad]], until victory or martyrdom.

===Equivalence of anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism===
Historian Jeffrey Herf argues that unlike the PLO, which has distinguished their national struggle against Zionism from general anti-Semitism (rhetorically, at least), Hamas, in their covenant, have purposefully fused these two struggles into one against the Jews and their country.&lt;ref name=Herf/&gt;

'''''Hanna v. Plumer''''', 380 U.S. 460 (1965), was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], in which the Court further refined the [[Erie doctrine|''Erie'' doctrine]] regarding when and by what means [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] are obliged to apply [[state law]] in cases brought under [[diversity jurisdiction]]. The question in the instant case was whether [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] governing [[service of process]] should yield to state rules governing the service of process in diversity cases. The Court ruled that under the facts of this case, federal courts shall apply the federal rule.

==Background of the case==
On February 6, 1963, petitioner, a citizen of Ohio, filed her complaint in the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|District Court for the District of Massachusetts]], claiming damages in excess of $10,000 for personal injuries resulting from an [[automobile accident]] in South Carolina, allegedly caused by the [[negligence]] of one Louise Plumer Osgood, a Massachusetts citizen deceased at the time of the filing of the complaint. Respondent, Mrs. Osgood's executor and also a Massachusetts citizen, was named as defendant. The Massachusetts rule at the time required personal service of process on the executor of an in-state defendant, while [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|Fed. R. Civ. P.]] 4 (d)(1) required only that service be made on a competent [[adult]] who resides at the [[house|residence]] of the defendant. The plaintiff left process at the residence of the executor, and so complied with the federal rule but not the state rule. The District Court granted [[summary judgment]] to the executor for the plaintiff's failure to make adequate service of process, ruling that the state rule applied based on the Supreme Court's prior precedents. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] affirmed.

==The Court's decision==
[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Earl Warren]] delivered the majority opinion, which held that the adoption of rule 4(d)(1) did not overstep the constitutional boundaries or the [[legislative intent]] of [[United States Congress|Congress]] in enacting the [[Rules Enabling Act]] (28 U.S.C. 2072) noting that "...the test must be whether a rule really regulates procedure..." Thus it was appropriate to apply Rule 4(d)(1) (now FRCP (4)(e)(2)) and not Massachusetts law in the Federal District Court. In reaching this decision the Court stated that the rule that state and federal courts should reach outcomes substantially the same was not a "[[amulet|talisman]]" and that there were more basic principles governing ''[[Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins]]'' and its progeny (that is, cases dealing with how Federal courts should apply state law). The purpose of ''Erie'' was to 1) discourage "forum shopping" and 2) avoid inequitable administration of laws. The instant case must be viewed in this light. While the outcome of the current case is determined by which law is applied, the [[rights]] in question are not substantial enough to create problems of unequal protection and because in ''Erie'' and its progeny there was no explicit conflict between state and federal rules. Thus, in those cases the Court held not that state rules trumped federal rules but that the federal rules, narrowly construed, did not cover the dispute whereas in the current case the federal and [[U.S. state|state]] laws are in direct conflict and the court has been instructed to follow the Federal Rule in these cases and there is no constitutional reason not to do so. In short, outcome determinative [[judgments]] are important under the [[United States|American]] legal system for deciding if a state or federal rule applies but in the current case denying the federal rule would remove any power whatsoever the federal courts have over their procedures. Harlan argued that forum shopping and equitable administration of laws were not the only concerns in ''Erie'' because [[General public|public]] uncertainty over which laws govern would be debilitating and therefore state law controls where it is an issue of affecting "primary decisions respecting human conduct." Under this understanding federal laws could be trumped by a state law, whether substantive or procedural law, meaning that Harlan's test is somewhere in between the "outcome determinative test" which gives extreme deference to state laws and the "forum shopping/equitable administration test" given in the case at hand, which states that a party must "substantially" raise equal protection issues.

Several of the suspects given as examples were wanted in connection to crimes unrelated to drugs, such as making bomb threats, impersonating a military officer, and theft from a jewelry store.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Zennie |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2408681/REVEALED-Secret-program-gives-federal-agents-nearly-instant-access-BILLIONS-AT-amp-T-phone-records-court-order.html?ito=feeds-newsxml |title=REVEALED: Secret program gives federal agents nearly instant access to BILLIONS of AT&amp;T phone records without a court order &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= 2013-09-02|accessdate=2013-09-04 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The White House said that the data raises no privacy concerns, a statement contradicted by Jameel Jaffer of the [[ACLU]], who said he would "speculate that one reason for the secrecy of the program is that it would be very hard to justify it to the public or the courts."&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Noel Brinkerhoff |url=http://www.allgov.com/news/top-stories/forget-the-nsa-att-helps-dea-collect-even-more-phone-call-details-130903?news=851026 |title=Top Stories - Forget the NSA; AT&amp;T Helps DEA Collect even more Phone Call Details - AllGov - News |publisher=AllGov |date=2013-09-03 |accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was likened to proposals made by legislators after the disclosure of [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], in particular one by Representative [[Adam Schiff]] who had called for a "look at changing the telephone metadata program by having phone companies retain their own data, rather of {{sic}} the government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Eileen Sullivan and Gene Johnson, Associated Press |url=http://nation.time.com/2013/09/02/drug-agents-plumb-vast-database-of-call-records/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130904222151/http://nation.time.com/2013/09/02/drug-agents-plumb-vast-database-of-call-records/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-09-04 |title=Drug Agents Plumb Vast Database of Call Records |publisher=Nation.time.com |date=2013-09-02 |accessdate=2013-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spokespeople for Sprint, Verizon and T-mobile USA would not comment on whether their companies offered similar services.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2838">'''Intellectual Reserve, Inc''' ('''IRI''') is a non-profit corporation based in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], United States. Founded in 1997, it is wholly owned and operated by the [[Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). It holds the church's [[intellectual property]], including [[copyright]]s and [[trademark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Rights and Use Information | work=lds.org | publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | url=http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,120-1-46-1,00.html | accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IRI owns over 60 trademarks associated with the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Intellectual Reserve, Inc. | work=Trademarkia | url=http://www.trademarkia.com/company-intellectual-reserve-inc-613675-page-1-2 | accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mormon as a trademark==
In some countries, "Mormon" and some phrases including the term are [[registered trademarks]] owned by IRI.&lt;ref&gt;For example, "Mormon Tabernacle Choir" is registered as United States [http://tarr.uspto.gov/tarr?regser=registration&amp;entry=2766231&amp;action=Request+Status Federal TM Reg. No. 2766231], and "Mormon" is registered in the European Community serial number EC004306701, registered July 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the LDS Church applied for a trademark in the United States on "Mormon" as applied to religious services; however, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] rejected the application, stating that the term "Mormon" was too generic and is popularly understood as referring to a particular kind of church, similar to "[[Presbyterian]]" or "[[Methodist]]", rather than a service mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Offc Action Outgoing | work=Trademark Document Retrieval (TDR) | publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] | date=November 1, 2005 | format=Application number 78161091 | url=http://tmportal.uspto.gov/external/portal/tow | accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application was abandoned as of August 22, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Latest Status Info | format=Federal TM Ser.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3689">{{Taxation in the Ottoman Empire sidebar}}
'''İspençe''' was a tax levied on [[non-Muslim]]s in the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ACCOUNTING METHOD  USED BY OTTOMANS  FOR 500 YEARS: STAIRS (MERDIBAN) METHOD|pages=192|url=http://www.sgb.gov.tr/Publications/Accounting%20Method%20Used%20By%20Ottomans%20For%20500%20Years%20-%20Stairs%20(Merdiban)%20Method.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=morea&gt;{{cite book|title=A historical and economic geography of Ottoman Greece: the southwestern Morea in the 18th century|year=2005|publisher=ASCSA|isbn=978-0-87661-534-8|pages=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ju9sKUox3OcC&amp;dq=ispence&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

İspençe was a land-tax on non-Muslims in parts of the Ottoman Empire; its counterpart, for Muslim taxpayers, was the resm-i çift - which was set at slightly lower rate.&lt;ref name=Malcolm&gt;{{cite book|last=Malcolm|first=Noel|title=Kosovo: A Short History|year=1999|publisher=Harper Perennial|isbn=978-0-06-097775-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treasury was well aware of the difference in tax takes, and the incentive to convert; the legal reforms of [[Bayezid II]] halved some criminal penalties on nonmuslim taxpayers "''so that the taxpayers shall not vanish''";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heyd|first=Uriel|title=Studies in old Ottoman criminal law|year=1973|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=156, 287}}&lt;/ref&gt; this rule was reconfimed, a century later, in 1587. In other cases, local taxes were imposed on nonmuslims specifically to encourage conversion.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

İspençe had existed in the Balkans before the Ottoman conquest; the Ottoman Empire typically adapted local taxes and institutions in each conquered area, leading to a patchwork of different taxes and rates. The concept of İspençe, theoretically a payment in lieu of [[corvee labour]], was derived from the Byzantine "zeugaratikion", a land tax based on the [[zeugarion]] - the area of farmland which could be ploughed by a pair of oxen. The zeugarion itself was taken up as the Ottoman "[[çift]]", a word meaning "pair".&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

==Variation==
Despite taxes being set centrally, by the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]], there was some local variance; around 1718. the [[kadı]] of Janjevo complained to Istanbul that the local lord set ispençe at 80 [[akçe]]s per year rather than official rate of 32.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

As with other [[Taxation in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman taxes]], there were various exemptions and loopholes; royal hunters, who provided birds-of-prey to the court, had an exemption from ispençe (and other taxes); they could pass on their job, and the tax exemption, to their sons.&lt;ref name=Acun&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acun|first=Fatma|title=The Other Side of the Coin: Tax Exemptions within the Context of Ottoman Taxation History|journal=Bulgarian Historical Review|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also some exemptions for those unable to work their land through disability, although it was expected that the elderly would have children able to work and therefore to pay ispençe.

The tax was paid by adult male heads of households; in the [[Morea]] it increased to 25 akces (from 20) between 1480 and 1512, and stayed at a similar level after that, (for most), confirmed by the tahrir of 1583; but widows may have paid a reduced rate, and Jews may have paid 125 akces.&lt;ref name=morea/&gt;

'''Jaime Eyzaguirre'''  (21 December 1908 – 17 September 1968) was a [[Chilean people|Chilean]] lawyer, essayist and historian. He is variously recognized as a writer of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or [[Conservatism|conservative]]{{efn-ua|This label groups Eyzaguirre with other Chilean historians considered conservative such as [[Alberto Edwards]], [[Francisco Antonio Encina]] and [[Mario Góngora]].&lt;ref name=Gongetal201-202/&gt;}} [[historiography]] in his country.&lt;ref name=Gongetal201-202&gt;Góngora ''et al''., pp. 201–202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eyzaguirrememoria/&gt;

==Early life and marriage==
Eyzaguirre was born into a religious upper class family in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. As young man he studied law in the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]] (PUC) and was member of the Catholic student organization [[Asociación Nacional de Estudiantes Católicos]].{{efn-ua|Most students of the university were members of this organization. Including Eyzaguirre's contemporaries like [[Alberto Hurtado]], [[Clotario Blest]], [[Eduardo Frei Montalva|Eduardo Frei]] and [[Mario Góngora]].&lt;ref name=Eyzaguirrememoria/&gt;}} During his studies he was influenced by the [[Jesuit]] [[Fernando Vives]] and the writings of [[Manuel Lacunza]].&lt;ref name=Eyzaguirrememoria&gt;{{Cite journal| url   = http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-656.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eyzaguirre started to court Adriana Philippi{{efn-ua|Adriana came from a family of scientists. Her paternal grandfather was [[Federico Philippi]] son of [[Rodolfo Amando Philippi]] both of whom were [[naturalist]]s. Her maternal grandfather was Vicente Izquierdo, a [[physician]], botanist and [[entomology|entomologist]]. The father of Adriana, [[Julio Philippi|Julio Philippi Bihl]], was a lawyer, economist and politician. She was Catholic as Julio Philippi was a Catholic convert from [[Lutheranism]].&lt;ref name=Gongetal149-142/&gt;}} in 1929 and married her in 1934.&lt;ref name=Gongetal149-142&gt;Góngora ''et al''., pp. 140–142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Essayist, historian and teacher==
The PUC founded its Pedagogy School (''Escuela de Pedagogía'') in 1943 and contracted Eyzaguirre to be in charge of the History of Chile (''Historia de Chile'') classes. Most of the students of the time were priests, nuns and [[brother (Catholic)|brothers]]. He was assisted by [[Mario Góngora]] is some classes.&lt;ref name=Gongetal177-178&gt;Góngora ''et al''., pp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from this part-time work Eyzaguirre was also part-time teacher at Liceo Alemán.&lt;ref name=Gongetal156-160/&gt;
At the Pedagogy School Eyzaguirre met [[Ricardo Krebs]], who was also history teacher but had rather few contacts, and introduced him to the Catholic intellectual elite of Santiago.&lt;ref name=Gongetal177-178/&gt; His salary is reported to have been low at PUC and when "raised" it mostly had to do with the currency [[inflation]] experienced in Chile. Nevertheless he was allowed to rent a small local owned by the Archbishopric of Santiago at a relatively low price. Here, Eyzaguirre ran a small bookshop called ''El Arbol'' until the late 1950s when it was closed. Despite his economic hardships he twice refused to be assigned ambassador to Spain. Eyzaguirre thought any diplomatic work he did would need to compete with his work as historian and therefore he would not be able to accomplish a dedicated work in diplomacy. At the same time the writings of [[Léon Bloy]] provided him with comfort about his economic hardship.&lt;ref name=Gongetal156-160&gt;Góngora ''et al''., pp. 156–160&lt;/ref&gt;

===''O'Higgins'' and Spain===
A milestone in the work of Eyzaguirre was his essay ''O'Higgins'' that won a prize in 1946 to commemorate the centenary of the death of [[Bernardo O'Higgins]]. This was the first written work that granted Eyzaguirre some income.&lt;ref name=Gongetal156-160/&gt; The prize reward helped Eyzaguirre to finance a trip to Spain in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Góngora ''et al''., p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; This seven months long journey reinforced his leanings for Spanish heritage in his historiography.&lt;ref&gt;Góngora ''et al''., p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain Eyzaguirry held a course on Chilean political and constitutional history at [[Universidad Central de Madrid]]. His stay in [[Spain]] made him target of attacks in Chile from those critical of the [[Francoist Spain|Franco regime]], in particular from people associated with the ''[[National Falange]]'' party (not to be confused with the Spanish movement). Personally, Eyzaguirre admired the stoic stance of the isolated Francoist Spain against both Soviet and Western pressure but did never propagandize the Franco regime in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;Góngora ''et al''., pp. 225–226&lt;/ref&gt;

===Back in Chile===
For a time he was teacher of [[Jaime Guzmán]].&lt;ref name=Moncada28-29&gt;{{cite book |last=Moncada Durruti |first=Belén |date=2006 |title=Jaime Guzmán: una democracia contrarevolucionaria : el político de 1964 a 1980 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=M9xowjT-VGMC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=%22jaime+eyzaguirre%22+%22jaime+guzman%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jaime%20eyzaguirre%22%20%22jaime%20guzman%22&amp;f=false |location=Santiago |publisher=RIL editores |pages=28–29|isbn=978-956-284-520-5|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the journal ''[[Historia (Chilean journal)|Historia]]'' was established in 1961 Eyzaguirre served as its first director.&lt;ref name=Historia&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-97494.html

| language = Spanish
| postscript = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally Eyzaguirre dealt with similar topics as [[Lewis Hanke]]. He despised 19th century writers such as [[José Victorino Lastarria]] and [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] because he considered they "ruptured" the historical links to Spain and characterized their views as "[[apostasy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Góngora ''et al''., pp. 221–222&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Eyzaguirre was criticized by historians associated with left-wing historiography. [[Mario Céspedes]] said in reference to Eyzaguirre's writings on the [[conquest of Chile]] that the conquest was a search for indian labourers and "not a chivalrous journey". On the essay ''O'Higgins'' Céspedes wrote that it lacked "the social and economic causes of the facts". Historian [[Julio César Jobet]] made a more harsh criticism accusing Eyzaguirre of "exalting backward doctrines and institutions" and undermining the influence of "French rationalist and critical thought in the development and progress of Chile".&lt;ref&gt;Góngora ''et al''., pp. 197–198&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5030">&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Juanvaldezcr.jpg|thumb|right|A sticker seen on an espresso machine in the coffee growing regions of Costa Rica.]] --&gt;'''Juan Valdez drinks Costa Rican coffee''' ({{lang-es|Juan Valdez bebe café de Costa Rica}}) is a [[slogan]], implying that [[Juan Valdez]], a [[fictional character]] created by the [[Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia]] (Fedcafé), drinks [[coffee]] from [[Costa Rica]]. In Costa Rica, the slogan is popular on [[bumper stickers]].&lt;ref&gt;Costa Rica Tourism and Travel Bureau. February 24, 2006. "[http://www.rainforesttours.com/general.htm Costa Rica General Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229232219/http://www.rainforesttours.com/general.htm |date=December 29, 2006}}."&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan prompted a lawsuit for the first time in 2006, when Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia sued [[Café Britt]] following a t-shirt dispute.

==History==  	 
The origins of the slogan are unclear. [[Juan Valdez]] has appeared in advertisements for [[Colombia]]n coffee since 1959. [[Jaime Daremblum]], then-[[Foreign relations of Costa Rica|Costa Rican ambassador to the United States]], used the phrase in a 1999 speech.&lt;ref name="amcostarica"&gt;''A.M. Costa Rica''. May 11, 2006. "[http://www.amcostarica.com/051106.htm Colombians finally react to Juan Valdez joke]." Vol. 6. No. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; 	 
 		 
[[File:Juan Valdez drink costa rican coffe.JPG|thumb|right|A license plate frame featuring the slogan]]Apparently the message about Juan Valdez as a drinker of Costa Rican coffee was attributed to José Duval, a New York-based actor, who was the first Juan Valdez.&lt;ref name="amcostarica"/&gt;

==Legal disputes==
In 2006, The Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia received an injunction preventing the Costa Rican company Café Britt from selling [[t-shirt]]s with the slogan. Fedcafé then filed a $1 million lawsuit on July 7, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;VolCafe Specialty Coffee. July 7, 2006. "[http://www.volcafespecialty.com/CoffeeNews_Archives/CoffeeNews%20July%203-7,%202006v2.pdf Colombian Fedcafe files lawsuit against Costa Rican roaster]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}."&lt;/ref&gt; after Café Britt refused to sign a contract, stating that it must respect the [[intellectual property]] of Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia and refrain from using either the name or image of Juan Valdez. Café Britt filed a $200,000 counter-suit, after producing an [[affidavit]] from a Costa Rican man, Juan Valdez, certifying that ''he'' does drink Costa Rican coffee. Café Britt also argued that the phrase is so common as to be ineligible for legal protection.&lt;ref&gt;Costa Rican Vacations, UK. November 2006. "[http://www.costaricaholiday.co.uk/News/November.htm Coffee Character Chaos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008183111/http://www.costaricaholiday.co.uk/News/November.htm |date=October 8, 2007}}."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Blake. November 18, 2006. "[http://www.aboutcoffee.net/2006/11/juan-valdez-drinks-costa-rican-coffee.html Juan Valdez drinks Costa Rican Coffee]." ''Tico Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fedcafé maintains that Café Britt agreed in early 2006 to stop using its trademarks;&lt;ref name="amcostarica"/&gt; Pablo Vargas, the manager of Café Britt, denies that such an agreement existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{es_icon}} ''Nacion''. May 11, 2006. "[http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2006/mayo/11/economia2.html  Cafeteros colombianos y Britt se enfrentan por 'Juan Valdez']."&lt;/ref&gt;  
The only and final agreement, according to Fedcafé's proposal of January 19, 2006, consisted in the total recall of the t-shirts.  This is the agreement Britt accepted and executed on that same date.  In exchange, Fedcafé committed to dismiss any further legal process.&lt;ref&gt;{{es_icon}} ''Nacion''. January 13, 2007. "[http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2007/enero/13/economia889464.html Britt demanda a Federación colombiana por difamación]."&lt;/ref&gt;

Café Britt presented a criminal case against Gabriel Silva, Federacafé's manager, for presumably defamatory statements, as well as taking civil action against him for damages of $1,000,000. Mr. Silva was notified in Colombia through diplomatic channels.  All charges have since been dropped.  When asked to comment, Silva's lawyer, Kyle Hoskinson, stated, "I'm glad this is all over."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.portafolio.co/economia/finanzas/sigue-polemica-britt-federacafe-313470 |title=Sigue polémica Britt-Federacafé |trans-title=Britt-Federacafé Still Controversial |website=Portafolio |language=Spanish |date=March 6, 2007 |access-date=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''judge''' is a person who [[wiktionary:preside|presides]] over [[court]] proceedings, either alone or as a part of a [[Judicial panel|panel of judges]]. The powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different [[jurisdiction]]s. The judge is supposed to conduct the trial [[wiktionary:impartial|impartially]] and, typically, in an [[in open court|open court]]. The judge hears all the [[witness]]es and any other [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] presented by the barristers of the case, assesses the credibility and [[arguments]] of the parties, and then issues a ruling on the matter at hand based on his or her interpretation of the law and his or her own personal judgment. In some jurisdictions, the judge's powers may be shared with a [[jury]]. In [[inquisitorial system]]s of criminal investigation, a judge might also be an [[examining magistrate]].

==Functions==
The ultimate task of a judge is to settle a legal dispute in a final and public manner, and thus affirm the [[rule of law]]. Judges exercise significant governmental power. They can order police, military or judicial officials to execute searches, arrests, imprisonments, garnishments, distrainments, seizures, deportations and similar actions. However, judges also supervise that trial procedures are followed, in order to ensure consistency and impartiality and avoid arbitrariness. The powers of a judge are checked by higher courts such as appeals courts and supreme courts.

Before the trial, a pre-trial investigation collecting the facts has been conducted by police officials, such as [[police officer]]s and [[coroner]]s, [[prosecutor]]s or [[public procurator]]s. The court usually has three main legally trained court officials: the judge, the prosecutor and the defence attorney. The role of a judge varies between legal systems. In an [[adversarial system]] (common law), as in effect in the U.S. and England, the judge functions as an impartial referee, mainly ensuring correct procedure, while the prosecution and the defense present their case to a [[jury]], often selected from common citizens. The main factfinder is the jury, and the judge will then finalize sentencing. Nevertheless, in smaller cases judges can issue [[summary judgment]]s without proceeding to a jury trial. In an [[inquisitorial system]] (civil law), as in effect in continental Europe, there is no jury and the main factfinder is the judge, who will do the presiding, judging and sentencing on his own. As such, the judge is expected to apply the law directly, as in the French expression ''Le juge est la bouche de la loi'' ("The judge is the mouth of the law"). Furthermore, in some system even investigation may be conducted by the judge, functioning as an [[examining magistrate]].

Judges may work alone in smaller cases, but in criminal, family and other significant cases, they work in a panel. In some civil law systems, this panel may include [[lay judge]]s. Unlike professional judges, lay judges are not legally trained, but unlike jurors, lay judges are usually volunteers and may be politically appointed. Judges are often assisted by [[law clerk]]s, [[Referendary|referendaries]] and notaries in legal cases and by [[bailiff]]s or similar with security.

===Requirements and appointment===
There are both volunteer and professional judges. A volunteer judge, such as an English [[Magistrate (England and Wales)|magistrate]], is not required to have legal training and is unpaid. Whereas, a professional judge is required to be [[Legal education|legally educated]]; in the U.S., this generally requires a degree of [[Juris Doctor]]. Furthermore, significant professional experience is often required; for example, in the U.S., judges are often appointed from experienced [[Attorney at law|attorney]]s. Judges are often appointed by the [[head of state]]. In some U.S. jurisdictions, however, judges are elected in a political election.

Impartiality is often considered important for [[rule of law]]. Thus, in many jurisdictions judges may be appointed for life, so that they cannot be removed by the executive. However, in non-democratic systems, the appointment of judges may be highly politicized and they often receive instructions on how to judge, and may be removed if their conduct doesn't please the political leadership.

===Judge as an occupation===
Judges must be able to research and process extensive lengths of documents and other case material, understand complex cases and possess a thorough understanding of the law and legal procedure, which requires excellent skills in logical reasoning, analysis and decision-making. Excellent writing skills are also a necessity, given the finality and authority of the documents written. Judges work with people all the time; by the nature of the job, good dispute resolution and interpersonal skills are a necessity.&lt;ref name="thebalance" /&gt; Judges are required to have [[good moral character]], i.e. there must be no history of crime. Professional judges often enjoy a high salary, in the U.S. the median salary of judges is $101,690 per annum,&lt;ref name="thebalance"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebalance.com/judge-job-description-career-profile-2164303|title=What Does It Take to Be a Judge?

{{Main|Court dress}}
A variety of traditions have become associated with the rank or occupation. [[Gavel]]s (a ceremonial hammer) are used by judges in many countries, to the point that the gavel has become a symbol of a judge. In many parts of the world, judges wear long [[robe]]s (often in black or red) and sit on an elevated platform during trials (known as the bench).

American judges frequently wear black robes. American judges have ceremonial [[gavel]]s, although American judges have court deputies or bailiffs and ''[[contempt of court]]'' power as their main devices to maintain decorum in the courtroom. However, in some of the [[Western United States]], like California, judges did not always wear robes and instead wore everyday clothing. Today, some members of [[state supreme court]]s, such as the [[Maryland Court of Appeals]] wear distinct dress. In Italy and [[Portugal]], both judges and lawyers wear particular black robes.

In some countries, especially in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], judges wear [[Wig (hair)|wigs]]. The long wig often associated with judges is now reserved for ceremonial occasions, although it was part of the standard attire in previous centuries.  A short wig resembling but not identical to a [[barrister]]'s wig (a Bench Wig) would be worn in court.  This tradition, however, is being phased out in Britain in non-criminal courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/B/BRITAIN_JUDGES_WIGS?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT Hosted.ap.org]{{dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Oman]], the judge wears a long stripe (red, green white), while the attorneys wear the black gown.

In Portugal and in the former [[Portuguese Empire]], the judges used to carry a staff that was red for ordinary judges and white for the [[Juiz de fora (office)|judges from the outside]].

===Asia===

==== Hong Kong ====
In [[Hong Kong]], court proceedings are conducted in either English or [[Hong Kong Cantonese]] (a dialect of [[Yue Chinese]]). Judges of Hong Kong retain many of the English traditions such as wearing wigs and robes in trials.

In the lower courts, magistrates are addressed as ''Your worship'', and district court judges as ''Your Honour''.

In the superior courts of record, namely the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]] and the [[High Court (Hong Kong)|High Court]] (which consists of the [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal]] and the [[Court of First Instance (Hong Kong)|Court of First Instance]]), judges are addressed as ''My Lord'' or ''My Lady'' and referred to as ''Your Lordship'' or ''Your Ladyship'', following the English tradition.

In writing, the post-nominal letters ''PJ'' is used to refer to a permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal and ''NPJ'' to a non-permanent judge. In the High Court, the abbreviation ''JA'' is used to denote a justice of appeal, and the letter ''J'' refers to a judge of the Court of First Instance.

[[Master (judiciary)|Masters]] of the High Court are addressed as ''Master''.

When trials are conducted in Chinese, judges were addressed, in Cantonese, as ''Fat Goon Dai Yan'' ({{Lang-yue|法官大人|lit=Judge, your lordship|translit=Fǎguān dàrén|label=[[Hong Kong Cantonese]]}}) before the transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to China, and as ''Fat Goon Gok Ha'' ({{Lang-yue|法官閣下|links=no|lit=Judge, your honour|translit=Fǎguān géxià|label=Hong Kong Cantonese}}) since 1997. ''Fat Goon'' ({{Lang-yue|法官|links=no|lit=Judge|translit=Fǎguān|label=Hong Kong Cantonese}}) means "judge".

==== India ====

In India, judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts were addressed as ''Your Lordship'' or ''My Lord'' and ''Your Ladyship'' or ''My Lady'', a tradition directly attributable to England. The [[Bar Council of India]] had adopted a resolution in April 2006 and added a new Rule 49(1)(j) in the [[Legal practice laws in India|Advocates Act]]. As per the rule, lawyers can address the court as ''Your Honour'' and refer to it as ''Honourable Court''. If it is a subordinate court, lawyers can use terms such as ''sir'' or any equivalent phrase in the regional language concerned. Explaining the rationale behind the move, the Bar Council had held that the words such as ''My Lord'' and ''Your Lordship'' were "relics of the colonial past". The resolution has since been circulated to all state councils and the Supreme Court for adoption but over five years now, the resolution largely remained on paper.

However, in an unprecedented move in October 2009, one of the judges of Madras HC, Justice K Chandru had banned lawyers from addressing his court as ''My Lord'' and ''Your Lordship''.

====Israel====
In Israel, the judges ({{Lang-he|שופט‬|lit=judge|translit=shofét}}) of all courts are addressed as ''Sir'', ''Madam'' ({{Lang-he|אדוני‬‎/גבירתי‬|link=no|translit=ado'nai/geberet}}) or ''Your Honor'' ({{Lang-he|כבודו‬‎/כבודה‬|link=no|translit=kabowd/}}). Typically after every naming you will hear ''haShofét'', meaning "the judge" after the respective address. For example, ''Your Honor the Judge'' would be {{Lang-he|כבוד השופט‬|label=none}} (''kabowd haShofét'').

==== Malaysia ====
In Malaysia, judges of the subordinate courts are addressed as ''Tuan'' or ''Puan'' ("Sir", "Madam"), or ''Your Honour''. Judges of the superior courts are addressed as ''Yang Arif'' (&lt;small&gt;{{Lit.}}&lt;/small&gt; "Learned One") or ''My Lord'', ''My Lady'', etc.; and ''Your Lordship'' or ''My Ladyship'' if the proceedings, as they generally are in the superior courts, are in English.

==== Pakistan ====
In Pakistan, judges of the Supreme Court and the high courts are addressed as ''Your Lordship'' or ''My Lord'' or ''Lordship'' and ''Your Ladyship'' or ''My Lady'', a tradition directly attributable to England. There is some resistance to this on religious grounds but more or less continues till this day. In lower courts, judges are addressed as ''sir'', ''madam'' or the [[Urdu]] equivalent ''Janab'' or ''Judge Sahab''.

==== Sri Lanka ====
In [[Sri Lanka]], judges of most courts are addressed as ''Your Honour'', however the [[Chief Justice of Sri Lanka|Chief Justice]] is addressed as ''Your Lordship''. Judges of the [[Supreme Court of Sri Lanka|Supreme Court]] and the Appeal Court receives the title ''The Honourable''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Justices of the Supreme Court who do not hold life peerages are now given the courtesy style "Lord" or "Lady."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/pr_1013.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207071932/http://supremecourt.uk/docs/pr_1013.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Justices of the Supreme Court are addressed as "My Lord/Lady" in court.  In the law reports, the Justices of the Supreme Court are usually referred to as "Lord/Lady N", although the Weekly Law Reports appends the post-nominal letters "JSC" (e.g. "Lady Smith JSC"). The President and Deputy President of the Court are afforded the post-nominal letters PSC and DPSC respectively. Only experienced [[barrister]]s or [[solicitor]]s are usually appointed as judges.

Judges of the [[High Court]] and [[Court of Appeal]] are [[Forms of address in the United Kingdom|addressed]] (when sitting in those courts) as "My Lord" or "My Lady" and referred to as "Your Lordship" or "Your Ladyship".

=====Northern Ireland=====
The judicial system of [[Northern Ireland]] is very similar to that of England and Wales, and superior court judges are addressed the same way as those in England and Wales. However, there are a few differences at the lower levels.

In Northern Ireland, the  equivalent to a Circuit Judge is a [[County Court]] Judge, and they are addressed and titled the same way as a Circuit Judge is in England and Wales. The senior County Court Judges assigned to the County Court Divisions of [[Belfast]] and [[Derry]] have the titles of [[Recorder of Belfast]] and Recorder of Londonderry (or Derry) respectively, but are addressed the same as other County Court Judges. A district judge sitting in the County Court is addressed as "Your Honour".

A District Judge (Magistrates' Court) is addressed as "Your Worship". A Lay Magistrate, in cases where they are present, is also addressed as "Your Worship", and may use the post nominals "LM", e.g. "John Smith LM".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofLaw/Education/handbooks/Filetoupload,150353,en.pdf {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118122017/http://www.law.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofLaw/Education/handbooks/Filetoupload%2C150353%2Cen.pdf |date=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
In general, Canadian judges may be addressed directly, depending on the province, as "My Lord", "My Lady", "Your Honour" or "Justice" and are formally referred to in the third person as "The Honourable Mr. (or Madam) Justice 'Forename Surname'".  Less formally, judges of a Superior Court are referred to as "Justice 'Surname'", not as "Judge 'Surname.'"  When referred to in a decision of a court, judges' titles are often abbreviated to the suffix "J.", so that Justice Smith will be referred to as Smith J.  Judges in some superior courts are addressed as "My Lord" or "My Lady".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://albertacourts.ab.ca/go/CourtServices/FamilyJusticeServices/tabid/139/Default.aspx |title=Albertacourts.ab.ca |publisher=Albertacourts.ab.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425233046/http://albertacourts.ab.ca/go/CourtServices/FamilyJusticeServices/tabid/139/Default.aspx |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ontario]], judges are never referred to as "My Lord" or "My Lady," but only as "Your Honour" at the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ojen.ca/sites/ojen.ca/files/sites/default/files/resources/Jurisdiction%20of%20Ontario%20Courts.pdf|title = Ontario Justice Education Network Handout: The Jurisdiction of Ontario Courts|date = |access-date = 2016-02-23|website = |publisher = Ontario Justice Education Network|last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160328080446/http://ojen.ca/sites/ojen.ca/files/sites/default/files/resources/Jurisdiction%20of%20Ontario%20Courts.pdf|archivedate = 2016-03-28|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly, translations of these titles such as ''Votre Honneur'' ("your honour") or ''Votre Seigneurie'' ("your lordship") were used in French; today, only ''Monsieur le juge'' and ''Madame la juge'' are officially used. Both the titles "judge" and "justice" are translated ''juge.''

Generally, it is only appropriate to use the term "judge" when speaking of an anonymous or general position, such as "the trial judge," or when referring to a member of an inferior or provincial court such as the Ontario Court of Justice. The exception is [[Citizenship Judge]]s who are referred to only as "Judge 'Surname.'" in accordance with their appointment as independent decision makers of the [[Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada#Citizenship Commission|Citizenship Commission]].

Like other members of the Commonwealth, a [[justice of the peace#Canada|justice of the peace]] is addressed as "Your Worship," and a [[Master (judiciary)#Canada|Master of a Superior Court]] is both addressed and referred to as "Master."

====United States====
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Supreme Court US 2010.jpg|thumb|The [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in 2010.]]
In many [[U.S. state|states]] throughout the [[United States]], a judge is addressed as "Your Honor" or "Judge" when presiding over the court. "Judge" may be more commonly used by attorneys and staff, while either may be commonly used by the plaintiff or defendant. Notably, the [[Superior Court of Los Angeles County]], the largest unified trial court in the United States, has a rule that the judge shall be addressed only as "Your Honor" while in court, and never as "Judge," "Judge (name)," "ma'am," or "sir."&lt;ref&gt;Rule 3.95, Los Angeles Superior Court Rules.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is somewhat unusual as "Judge" and "Judge (name)" or similar forms of address are considered appropriate and respectful in many other courts.

The judges of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], and the judges of the [[state supreme court|supreme courts]] of several [[US states]] and other countries are called "justices".  Justices of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and Justices of other courts are addressed as "Justice (name)." The Chief Justice of the United States is formally addressed as "Mr. Chief Justice" but also may be identified and addressed as "Chief Justice (name)".

The justices of the supreme courts usually hold higher offices than any other judges in a jurisdiction, including a [[justice of the peace]], a judge who holds police court in some [[jurisdiction]]s and who may also try [[small claims court|small claims]] and [[misdemeanor]]s. However, the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] inverts this usual order.   The initial trial court in this state is called the Supreme Court of New York, and its judges are called "justices".  The next highest appellate court is the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, whose judges are also called "justices".  However, the highest court in New York is called the New York Court of Appeals, whose members are called "judges".

Judges in certain jurisdictions, such as New York and New Jersey, who deal with guardianships, trusts and estates are known as "[[Surrogate Court|surrogate]]s."

A ''[[senior status|senior judge]],'' in US practice, is a retired judge who handles selected cases for a governmental entity while in retirement, on a [[part-time]] basis.

Subordinate or inferior jurisdiction judges in US legal practice are sometimes called [[magistrate]]s, although in the federal court of the United States, they are called [[United States magistrate judge|magistrate judges]]. Subordinate judges in US legal practice who are appointed on a case-by-case basis, particularly in cases where a great deal of detailed and tedious evidence must be reviewed, are often called "masters" or "special masters" and have authority in a particular case often determined on a case by case basis.

Judges of courts of specialized jurisdiction (such as [[bankruptcy court]]s or [[juvenile court]]s) were sometimes known officially as "[[referee]]s," but the use of this title is in decline. Judges sitting in courts of equity in [[common law]] systems (such as judges in the equity courts of [[Delaware]]) are called "[[chancellor]]s."

Individuals with judicial responsibilities who report to an executive branch official, rather than being a part of the judiciary, are often called "[[administrative law judge]]s" in US practice. They were previously known as hearing examiners. They commonly make initial determinations regarding matters such as [[workers' compensation]], eligibility for government benefits, regulatory matters, and immigration determinations.

Judges who derive their authority from a contractual agreement of the parties to a dispute, rather than a governmental body, are called [[arbitrator]]s. They typically do not receive the honorific forms of address nor do they bear the symbolic trappings of a publicly appointed judge. However, it is now common for many retired judges to serve as arbitrators, and they will often write their names as if they were still judges, with the parenthetical "(Ret.)" for "Retired."

Unlike many civil law countries; which have some courts on which panels of judges with nearly equal status composed of both legally trained professional judges and lay judges who lack legal training and are not career judges, the United States legal system (like most Anglo-American legal systems) makes a clear distinction between professional judges and laypeople involved in deciding a case who are jurors who are part of a [[jury]]. Most but not all US judges have professional credentials as lawyers. Non-lawyer judges in the United States are often elected, and are typically either justices of the peace or part-time judges in rural limited jurisdiction [[courts]]. A non-lawyer judge typically has the same rights and responsibilities as a lawyer who is a judge holding the same office and is addressed in the same manner.

====Australia====
[[File:Susan Kiefel 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Susan Kiefel]], Chief Justice of Australia]]
In [[Australia]] judges and, since 2007, magistrates, of all jurisdictions including the [[High Court of Australia]] are now addressed as "Your Honour". In legal contexts, they are referred to as "His/Her Honour" and "the Honourable Justice Surname" (for judges of superior courts) or "his/her Honour Judge Surname" (for inferior courts). Outside legal contexts, the formal terms of address are "Judge" (for puisne justices) or "Chief Justice" (for chief justices).

The title for most puisne judges is "Justice", which is abbreviated in law reports to a postnominal "J", in the form "Surname J". Chief Justices of the High Court and of state Supreme Courts are titled "Chief Justice", which is abbreviated in law reports to a postnomial "CJ". Judges in State Supreme Courts with a separate Court of Appeal division (New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia) are referred to as Justices/Judges of the Appeal (abbreviated "Surname JA"), while the President of the Court of Appeal is referred to as "President" (abbreviated "Surname P").&lt;ref&gt;New South Wales Supreme Court, [http://www.supremecourt.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/supremecourt/judicialcontacts/addressing_judicial_officers.html Addressing Judicial Officers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818100909/http://www.supremecourt.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/supremecourt/judicialcontacts/addressing_judicial_officers.html |date=2013-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New Zealand ====
In [[New Zealand]], judges of the [[District Court of New Zealand]] generally referred to as "His/Her Honour" or "Sir/Madame."  Judges from the [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]], [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Appeals Court]], and [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]] are referred to as "Justice [Surname]."

In [[Brazil]], judges are simply called "Juiz" or "Juíza" (male and female forms of "judge") and traditionally addressed to as "Vossa Excelência" (lit. "Your Excellency", translated as "Your Honor") or "Meritíssimo" (lit. "Honorable", but it is used as a pronoun also translated as "Your Honor"). Judges that are part of a panel in a State Court, or Federal Court are called "desembargadores". Judges sitting in the higher courts ([[Supremo Tribunal Federal]], [[Superior Tribunal de Justiça]], [[Superior Labor Court|Tribunal Superior do Trabalho]], Superior Tribunal Militar and [[Tribunal Superior Eleitoral]]) are called "ministro" or "ministra" (male and female forms of "minister") and also referred to as "Vossa Excelência".

===International courts===
At the [[International Court of Justice]], judges may be addressed by the titles they received in their countries of origin.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

[[Judges of the International Criminal Court]] are referred to as "judge."{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Biblical judges ==
The Biblical [[Book of Judges]] revolves around a succession of leaders who were known as [[Biblical judges|"judges"]] ([[Hebrew]] shoftim שופטים) but who – aside from their judicial function – were also tribal war leaders. The same word is, however, used in contemporary [[Israel]] to denote judges whose function and authority is similar to that in other modern countries. The same word is also used in modern Hebrew for [[referee]]s in any kind of contest and in particular in sport. To distinguish them from judicial judges and from each other, the kind of the contest is added after the word "shofet" in the [[Construct state]] (e.g. "shofet kaduregel" שופט כדורגל, litteraly "judge of soccer").

'''Legal formalism''' is both a descriptive theory and a [[Normative|normative theory]] of how judges should decide cases. In its descriptive sense, formalists believe that judges should reach their decisions by applying uncontroversial principles to the [[Trier of fact|facts]]. Although the large number of decided cases implies a large number of principles, formalists believe that there is an underlying logic to these principles that is straightforward and which legal experts can readily discover. The ultimate goal of formalism would be to formalise the underlying principles in a single and determinate system that could be applied mechanically (hence the label 'mechanical jurisprudence'). Formalism has been called 'the official theory of judging'. It is the thesis to which [[legal realism]] is the antithesis.

As a normative theory, formalism is the view that judges should decide cases by the application of uncontroversial principles to the facts.

==Definition==
Formalism remains one of the most influential and important theories of adjudication and has been called the thesis to which realism is the antithesis.&lt;ref&gt;Grey, T. C. (1983). Langdell’s Orthodoxy. University of Pittsburgh Law Review, 45, 1. p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Formalism sees adjudication as the uncontroversial application of accepted principles to known facts to derive the outcome in the manner of a deductive syllogism.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, R. A. (2008). How Judges Think. Cambridge, Massachusetts; London: Harvard University Press.
p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Formalists believe that the relevant [[law|principles of law]] of a given area can be discerned by surveying the [[case law]] of that area.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony T. Kronman. (1993). The Lost Lawyer: Failing Ideals of the Legal Profession. Cambridge, Massachusetts ; London: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, p.171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leiter, B. (1997). Is There an “American” Jurisprudence? Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, 17(2), 367–387. p.373&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Columbus Langdell]] believed that the only resources needed to create a science of law was a law library.&lt;ref&gt;Langdell, C. C. (1887). Harvard Law School. Law Quarterly Review, 3, 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bix, B. H. (2009). Jurisprudence: Theory and Context (5th edition). Sweet &amp; Maxwell. p.192&lt;/ref&gt;

Formalism has been called an 'autonomous discipline',&lt;ref&gt;Posner, How Judges Think, 2008, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the formalist belief that judges require only the facts and the law, all normative issues such as morality or politics being irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;Leiter, B. (2010). Legal Formalism and Legal Realism: What Is the Issue? Legal Theory, 16(02), 111–133. http://doi.org/10.1017/S1352325210000121&lt;/ref&gt; If judges are seen to be simply applying the rules in a mechanical and uncontroversial manner, this protects judges from criticism. For this reason, formalism has been called 'the official theory of judging'.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, How Judges Think, 2008, p.41&lt;/ref&gt;

Formalists, contrary to Realists, take the judge at face-value, assuming that the facts and principles as recorded in a judge's reasons reflect the facts that the judge considered to be relevant, and the principles that the judge arrived at to reach the judgement. They therefore place little emphasis on the means by which a judge determines the facts.

As a normative theory, legal formalists argue that judges and other public officials should be constrained in their interpretation of legal texts, suggesting that investing the judiciary with the power to say what the law ''should'' be, rather than confining them to expositing what the law ''does'' say, violates the [[separation of powers]]. This argument finds its most eloquent expression in the [[Massachusetts Constitution of 1780]], which provides that the [[judiciary]] "shall never exercise the [[Legislature|legislative]] and [[Executive (government)|executive]] powers, or either of them; to the end [that Massachusetts' government] may be a government of laws, and not of men".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhinet.org/ccs/docs/ma-1780.htm] Mass. Const. (1780).&lt;/ref&gt; Formalism seeks to maintain that separation as a "theory that law is a set of rules and principles independent of other political and social institutions".&lt;ref name="definition.blacks"&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]] 913 (7th ed. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to legal realism==
Legal formalism can be contrasted to legal instrumentalism, a view associated with American [[legal realism]]. [[Instrumentalism]] is the view that creativity in the interpretation of legal texts is justified in order to assure that the law serves good public policy and social interests, although legal instrumentalists could also see the end of law as the promotion of [[justice]] or the protection of [[human rights]]. Legal formalists counter that giving judges authority to change the law to serve their own ideas regarding policy undermines the rule of law. This tension is especially interesting in [[common law]], which depend on judicial [[precedent]]. The "claim to fame" of common law systems is that the task of developing and updating law is best done incrementally by courts that keep in close touch with social, economic, and technological realities than by political organs that, every so often, will attend to legal reforms. Thus legal realism or "relationalism" has been favored in some common law jurisdictions, where the kind of legal [[Codification (law)|codification]] associated with [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] are virtually unknown.

==Justice Scalia and formalism==
The late [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] was noted for his formalist views about a variety of topics, particularly his view that the [[United States Constitution]] should be interpreted in accord with its [[originalism|original meaning]] and his view that statutes should be read in accord with their [[Plain meaning rule|plain meaning]].

In ''A Matter of Interpretation'', Scalia defended textualism — and, by extension, formalism — saying:
:Of all the criticisms leveled against textualism, the most mindless is that it is formalist. The answer to that is, ''of course it's formalistic!'' The rule of law is ''about'' form . . . A murderer has been caught with blood on his hands, bending over the body of his victim; a neighbor with a video camera has filmed the crime and the murderer has confessed in writing and on videotape. We nonetheless insist that before the state can punish this miscreant, it must conduct a full-dress criminal trial that results in a verdict of guilty. Is that not formalism? Long live formalism! It is what makes us a government of laws and not of men.&lt;ref name="scalia.amoi"&gt;Antonin Scalia, ''A Matter of Interpretation'' 25 (1997) (emphasis in original).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scalia's strongest claim on Formalist credentials can be found in an essay entitled ''The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules''.&lt;ref name="scalia.rules"&gt;Antonin Scalia, ''The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules'', 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frederick Schauer==

Frederick Schauer, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, in 1988 published a law review article titled "Formalism" in ''The Yale Law Journal''. In it he urges scholars to rethink the "contemporary aversion to formalism" and states that his goal is to "rescue formalism from conceptual banishment".&lt;ref name="frederick.schauer"&gt;Frederick Schauer, ''Formalism'', 97 Yale L.J. 509, 511, 539 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; He argues formalism should be conceptually rethought, not in terms of merely whether it is a good or bad thing, but rather in terms of how language both can and should be used to restrict the power of decision-makers in the decision-making process.

==Woleński==
In his essay "Formal and informal in legal logic", [[Jan Woleński]] contends that there are "rhetorical functions of metalogical concepts that are used in legal discourse", and hence the introduction of the informal into otherwise [[imperative logic]]. He reviews Jørgensen’s paradox to introduce [[deontic logic]], and acknowledges this innovation by [[Georg Henrik von Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Woleński]] (2011) "Formal and Informal in Legal Logic", pages 73 to 86 in ''Approaches to Legal Rationality'', edited by D.M Gabbay, P. Canivez, S. Rahman &amp; A. Thierselin, [[Springer books]] {{ISBN| 978-90-481-9587-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lien''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|n}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|ən}}){{refn|The pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|n}} is more common in both UK and US English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/lien|title=lien - definition of lien in English - Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=lien|title=The American Heritage Dictionary entry: lien|first=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing|last=Company|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} is a form of [[security interest]] granted over an item of [[property]] to secure the payment of a [[debt]] or performance of some other obligation. The owner of the property, who grants the lien, is referred to as the ''lienee''&lt;ref&gt;"Lienee...One whose property is subject to a lien". Black's Law Dictionary, p. 832 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; and the person who has the benefit of the lien is referred to as the ''lienor''&lt;ref&gt;"Lienor... The person having or owning a lien; one who has a right of lien upon property of another". Black's Law Dictionary, p. 832 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; or ''lien holder''.

The [[etymological]] root is Anglo-French ''lien'', ''loyen'' "bond", "restraint", from Latin ''ligamen'', from ''ligare'' "to bind".

In the [[United States]], the term lien generally refers to a wide range of [[encumbrance]]s and would include other forms of [[Mortgage law|mortgage]] or charge.  In the US, a lien characteristically refers to ''[[Nonpossessory interest in land|nonpossessory]]'' security interests (see generally: [[Security interest#Security|Security interest—categories]]).

In other [[common-law]] countries, the term lien refers to a very specific type of security interest, being a passive right to retain (but not sell) property until the debt or other obligation is discharged.  In contrast to the usage of the term in the US, in other countries it refers to a purely ''possessory'' form of security interest; indeed, when possession of the property is lost, the lien is released.&lt;ref&gt;''Hatton v Car Maintenance' [1915] 1 Ch 621&lt;/ref&gt;  However, common-law countries also recognize a slightly anomalous form of security interest called an "equitable lien" which arises in certain rare instances.

Despite their differences in terminology and application, there are a number of similarities between liens in the US and elsewhere in the common-law world.

==United States==
Liens can be consensual or non-consensual (also termed voluntary or involuntary in different states). Consensual liens are imposed by a contract between the [[creditor]] and the debtor:

*[[mortgage law|mortgage]]
*[[chattel mortgage]]

Nonconsensual liens typically arise by [[statute]] or by the [[operation of law|operation]] of the [[common law]]. Those laws give a creditor the right to impose a lien on an item of [[real property]] or a [[Personal property|chattel]] by the existence of the relationship of creditor and debtor.  Those liens include

*[[Tax lien]]s, imposed to secure payment of a [[tax]];
*"Weed liens" and "Demolition liens", assessed by the government to rectify a property from being a nuisance and public hazard;
*[[Homeowner Association]] (HOA) liens for unpaid assessments, fines, late charges, interest, costs, and attorney fees;
*[[Lawyer|Attorney]]'s liens, against funds and documents to secure payment of fees;
*[[Mechanic's lien]]s, which secure payment for work done on property or [[real property|land]];
*[[Judgment (law)|Judgment]] liens, imposed to secure payment of a judgment; and
*[[Sea|Maritime]] liens, imposed on [[ship]]s by [[admiralty law]].

Liens are also "perfected" or "unperfected" (see [[perfection (law)|perfection]]). Perfected liens are those liens for which a creditor has established a priority right in the encumbered property with respect to third party creditors. Perfection is generally accomplished by taking steps required by law to give third party creditors notice of the lien. The fact that an item of property is in the hands of the creditor usually constitutes perfection. Where the property remains in the hands of the debtor, some further step must be taken, like recording a notice of the security interest with the appropriate office.

Perfecting a lien is an important part of the task of protecting the secured creditor's interest in the property.  A perfected lien is valid against bona fide purchasers of property, and even against a [[trustee]] in [[bankruptcy]]; an unperfected lien may not be.

===Equitable lien (U.S.)===
In the United States, references to an "equitable lien" is a right, enforceable only in [[Equity (law)|equity]], to have a demand satisfied out of a particular fund or specific property without having possession of the fund or property. An equitable lien is actually a [[legal remedy]], rather than a security interest created in contemplation of or in support of a transaction. In U.S. law, such liens characteristically arise in four circumstances:&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary'' (8th ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;
# when an occupant of land, believing in good faith to be the owner of the land, makes improvements, repairs or other expenditure that permanently increases the land's value;
# when one of two or more joint owners makes expenditures of the kind described above;
# when a [[Life estate|tenant for life]] completes permanent and beneficial improvements to the estate begun earlier by the [[testator]]; and
# when land or other property is transferred subject to the payment of debts, legacies, portions or [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuities]] to third persons.

===Mover's lien===
[[moving company|Movers]] are typically entitled to a '''mover's lien''' under [[Uniform Commercial Code|UCC]] § 7-307/308, to withhold a customer's [[Personal property|goods]] to secure payment.  This is a '''possessory lien''', and is the non-consensual type of lien (because it exists automatically under a statute instead of being affirmatively agreed upon).  However, the concept of a mover's lien is often abused in a [[moving scam]] known as a '''hostage load''', whereby the moving company will [[fraud]]ulently [[extortion|extort]] money not owed by the customer by refusing to deliver the goods unless the customer pays money inflated beyond the [[contract]]ual [[sales quote|estimate]].  Because the customer has an interest in obtaining their own goods, they are under duress to pay the ransom.  Hostage loads in at least the interstate context are illegal under [[Title 49 of the United States Code|49 U.S.C.]] 13905.  The [[Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration|FMCSA]] regulates the moving industry and sometimes takes enforcement action by fining and/or delicensure of offending moving companies.  Moving companies that deliberately engage in hostage-loading may also be considered to be engaging in [[racketeering]] in violation of the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]].

Disputes between legitimate lienholding of chattels vs. hostage-loading can sometimes be averted by the customer including an advanced (before-the-fact) consensual waiver of the mover's right to a lien in the written contract, obligating the moving company to deliver the goods with '''reasonable dispatch''' regardless of disputes over payment, and failure to do so would constitute [[conversion (law)|conversion]] or [[trespass to chattels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/157884/Transport%20Law%20Regulations/Holding%20Freight%20Hostage%20The%20Legal%20Wild%20West%20of%20the%20Transportation%20Industry|title=Holding Freight Hostage: The Legal Wild West Of The Transportation Industry - Transport - United States|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/rulemaking/2012-25678|title=Regulations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/7/part_3|title=PART 3. BILLS OF LADING: SPECIAL PROVISIONS|first=LII|last=Staff|date=20 November 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other common-law countries==
Outside of the US, a common-law lien may be defined in general terms as a passive right to retain a chattel (and, in certain cases, documentary intangibles and papers) conferred by law.  Modern law has generally left the legal lien to cases where it has been historically established without any real effort being made to make it applicable to modern conditions.  In ''Tappenden v Artus'' [1964] 2 QB 185 Diplock LJ referred to a lien as a "self help" remedy, like "other primitive remedies such as abatement of nuisance, self-defence or ejection of trespassers to land".  Equitable liens are an unusual species of property right, usually considered ''[[sui generis]]''.

===Common-law lien===
Common-law liens are divided into ''special liens'' and ''general liens''.  A special lien, the more common kind, requires a close connection between the property and the service rendered.  A special lien can only be exercised in respect of fees relating to the instant transaction; the lienor cannot use the property held as security for past debts as well.  A general lien affects all of the property of the lienee in the possession of the lienor, and stands as security for all of the debts of the lienee to the lienor.  A special lien can be extended to a general lien by contract, and this is commonly done in the case of carriers.&lt;ref&gt;''George Baker Ltd v Eynon'' [1974] 1 WLR 462&lt;/ref&gt;  A common-law lien only gives a passive right to retain; there is no power of sale which arises at common law,&lt;ref&gt;''Thames Iron Works v Patent Derrick'' (1860) 1 J&amp;H 93&lt;/ref&gt; although some statutes have also conferred an additional power of sale,&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see for example, Innkeepers Act 1878&lt;/ref&gt; and it is possible to confer a separate power of sale by contract.

The common-law liens are closely aligned to the so-called "common callings", but are not co-extensive with them.

A common-law lien is a very limited type of security interest.  Apart from the fact that it only amounts to a passive right to retain, a lien cannot be transferred;&lt;ref&gt;''Legg v Evans'' (1840) 6 M&amp;W 36&lt;/ref&gt; it cannot be asserted by a third party to whom possession of the goods is given to perform the same services that the original party should have performed;&lt;ref&gt;''Pennington v Reliance Motors Ltd'' [1923] 1 KB 127&lt;/ref&gt; and if the chattel is surrendered to the lienor, the lien entitlement is lost forever&lt;ref&gt;''Hatton v Car Maintenance'' [1915] 1 Ch 621&lt;/ref&gt; (except for where the parties agree that the lien shall survive a temporary re-possession by the lienor).  A lienee who sells the chattel unlawfully may be liable in conversion as well as surrendering the lien.&lt;ref&gt;''Mulliner v Florence (1878) 3 QBD 484&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equitable lien===
In common-law countries, equitable liens give rise to unique and difficult issues.  An equitable lien is a nonpossessory security right conferred by operation of law, which is similar in effect to an [[equitable charge]].  It differs from a charge in that it is non-consensual.  It is conferred only in very limited circumstances, the most common (and least ambiguous) of which is in relation to the sale of land; an unpaid vendor has an equitable lien over the land for the purchase price, notwithstanding that the purchaser has gone into occupation of the property.  It is seen as a counterweight to the equitable rule which confers a beneficial interest in the land on the purchaser once contracts are exchanged for purchase.

It is a matter of conjecture how far equitable liens extend outside of the unpaid vendor's lien.  Equitable liens have been held to exist in a number of cases involving [[chose in action|choses in action]], but not yet in relation to chattels.&lt;ref&gt;''Transport and General Credit v Morgan'' [1939] 2 All ER 17&lt;/ref&gt;  The Australian courts have been the most receptive towards equitable liens in relation to personal property (see ''Hewett v Court'' (1983) 57 ALJR 211, but a review of the cases still leaves a lack of clarity in relation to the principles upon which an equitable lien will be imposed.
* In ''Re Stucley'' [1906] 1 Ch 67 a vendor of a reversionary interest in a trust fund, who sold the interest to the trustee, was held to have an equitable lien in the subject matter, although it was clearly personalty and not realty.
* In ''Barker v Cox'' (1876) 4 Ch D 464 the purchaser of property which was included in a matrimonial settlement paid the price in advance to one of the trustees, and the purchaser was held to have an equitable lien in investments which the trustees subsequently acquired with the purchase price.
* In ''Langen and Wing v Bell'' [1972] Ch 685 a [[board of directors|director's]] service agreement required him to assign his shares in the [[company (law)|company]] if he was terminated, and he was to receive a price calculated at a later date when the annual accounts were available; he was held to have an equitable lien over the transferred shares to secure the payment of the eventual purchase price.
* In ''Lord Napier &amp; Etterick v Hunter'' [1993] 2 WLR 42 it was held that an indemnity insurer's [[subrogation]] rights in relation to funds improperly paid directly to the insured were subject to an equitable lien.
But overall, there is still perceived to be a lack of central nexus.&lt;ref&gt;See Phillips J, "Equitable Liens—A search for a unifying principle" in Palmer &amp; McKendrick, ''Interests in Goods'' (2nd ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statutory liens and contractual liens===
Although arguably not liens as such, two other forms of encumbrance are sometimes referred to as liens.

====Statutory liens====
Certain statutes provide for a passive right to retain property against its owner as security for obligations.  For example, section 88 of the [[Civil Aviation Act 1982]] of the United Kingdom permits an airport to detain aircraft for unpaid airport charges and aviation fuel.  Although this right has been treated as a lien under UK insolvency law,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Bristol Airport v Powdrill'' [1990] Ch 744&lt;/ref&gt; it has been argued that such statutory rights are not in fact liens, but rights analogous to liens,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Michael Bridge, ''Personal Property Law'' (2nd ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; although some might say that this is a distinction without a difference{{who|date=April 2014}}.

====Contractual liens====
It has also been argued that an agreement by contract that one party may retain the goods of another party until paid is not a lien,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; as under the common law, liens could only be non-consensual.  However, it appears that under insolvency law, such rights will be treated as liens even if they are not expressed to be liens.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Maritime liens==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Admiralty law]] --&gt;
{{main|Maritime lien}}
A '''maritime lien''' is a lien on a vessel, given to secure the claim of a creditor who provided maritime services to the vessel or who suffered an injury from the vessel's use.  Maritime liens are sometimes referred to as ''tacit hypothecation''.  Maritime liens have little in common with other liens under the laws of most jurisdictions.

The maritime lien has been described as "one of the most striking peculiarities of [[Admiralty law]]".&lt;ref name="Griffith Price 1940"&gt;Griffith Price, ''The Law of Maritime Liens'' (1940)&lt;/ref&gt;  A maritime lien constitutes a security interest upon ships of a nature otherwise unknown to the common law or equity.  It arises purely by [[operation of law]] and exists as a claim upon the property concerned, both secret and invisible, often given priority by statute over other forms of registered security interest.&lt;ref&gt;''Bankers Trust v Todd Shipyards, The Halcyon Isle'' [1981] AC 221&lt;/ref&gt;  Although characteristics vary under the laws of different countries, it can be described as:
# a privileged claim,
# upon maritime property,
# for service to it or damage done by it,
# accruing from the moment that the claim attaches,
# travelling with the property unconditionally,
# enforced by an action ''[[in rem]]''.&lt;ref name="Griffith Price 1940"/&gt;

In the [[mechanics lien]] process, a '''[[lien]] [[waiver]]''' is a document from a [[General contractor|contractor]], [[subcontractor]], materials supplier, equipment lessor or other party to the [[construction|construction project]] (the claimant) stating they have received [[payment]] and waive any future lien rights to the property (of the owner) for the amount paid. There are typically four types of lien waivers:

*Conditional waiver on progress payment - The ''safest'' waiver for claimants, this waiver generally specifies that ''if'' they have indeed been paid to date (and that includes no return or stopped payment checks) the waiver is an effective proof against any lien claim on the property.
*Unconditional waiver on progress payment - This waiver releases all claimant rights through a specific date unconditionally (and that includes no return or stopped payment checks).
*Conditional waiver on final payment - This waiver releases all claimant rights to file a mechanics lien ''if'' they have indeed been paid to date (and that includes no return or stopped payment checks).
*Unconditional final waiver final payment - The ''safest'' waiver for owners, this waiver generally releases ''all'' rights of the claimant to place a mechanics lien on the owners property unconditionally.  ''It is immaterial if the payment check has been returned or stopped payment''.  Claimants should issue this type of release only when they are positive their work is done and the payment has cleared their bank.  Owners should demand this release when they are paid in full. Some states allow an Unconditional Release upon final payment that is used to induce the final payment.  It is an inherent vagary in the lien release law.

In the [[United States]], some [[U.S. states|states]] only use a conditional waiver on progress payment and an unconditional waiver on final payment.

The mechanics lien process can be of great value to claimants in enforcing their claims, if done according to the laws of the various states, or the [[federal government]]. These parties are entitled to be paid for their material or labor contributions to the improvement of real property. Most forms for the process can be obtained from local office supply stores, and a few [[computer program]]s exist to handle the process on a nationwide basis.

{{Tort law}}

In the [[law]] of [[tort]]s, '''malpractice''', also known as [[professional negligence]],  is an "instance of [[negligence]] or incompetence on the part of a [[professional]]".&lt;ref name="blacks"&gt;Malpractice definition, {{cite book|last1=Garner|first1=Bryan A.|title=Black's Law Dictionary|date=2009|publisher=West|isbn=0314199497|edition=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=weU2AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professionals who may become the subject of malpractice actions include:

* '''medical professionals''': a [[medical malpractice]] claim may be brought against a [[physician|doctor]] or other healthcare provider who fails to exercise the degree of [[Duty of care|care]] and skill that a similarly situated professional of the same [[medical specialty]] would provide under the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malpractice|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/malpractice|website=Merriam-Webster.com|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''lawyers''': a [[legal malpractice]] claim may be brought against a lawyer who fails to render services with the level of skill, care and diligence that a [[Reasonable person|reasonable]] lawyer would apply under similar circumstances.&lt;ref name="blacks"/&gt;
* '''financial professionals''': professionals such as accountants, financial planners and stockbrokers, may be subject to claims for professional negligence based upon their failure to meet professional standards when providing services to their clients.&lt;ref name="el"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is Malpractice|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal-injury-and-torts/what-malpractice|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=7 December 2017|date=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''architects''': an architect or construction professional may be accused of professional negligence for failing to meet professional standards in the design and construction of buildings and structures.&lt;ref name="el"/&gt;

==Proof of malpractice==
Professional negligence actions require a professional relationship between the professional and the person claiming to have been injured by malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacobs|first1=Douglas|title=Suicide and Clinical Practice|date=1992|publisher=American Psychiatric Association Publishing|isbn=0880484551|page=148|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTuoxob0ByQC|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in order to sue a lawyer for malpractice the person bringing the claim must have had an attorney-client relationship with the lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bresnahan|first1=Pamela A.|title=Beware the Cocktail Party Client|url=https://apps.americanbar.org/legalservices/lpl/downloads/journalsept99.pdf|website=American Bar Association|accessdate=7 December 2017|date=September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, to succeed in a malpractice action the person making a malpractice claim must prove both that the professional committed an act of culpable negligence and that the person suffered injury as a result of the professional's error.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite journal|last1=Bal|first1=B. Sonny|title=An Introduction to Medical Malpractice in the United States|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|date=February 2009|volume=467|issue=2|pages=339–347|accessdate=|pmc=2628513|doi=10.1007/s11999-008-0636-2|pmid=19034593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical malpractice==
{{main|Medical malpractice}}
Medical malpractice is a highly complex area of law, with laws that differ significantly between [[jurisdiction]]s.&lt;ref name="marcus"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marcus|first1=Paul|title=Book Review of Medical Malpractice Law: A Comparative Law Study of Civil Responsibility Arising from Medical Care|journal=Hastings International and Comparative Law Review|date=1981|pages=235–243|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/1138/|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, medical malpractice and the rise in incidences of claims against individual and institutional providers has led to the evolution of [[patient advocate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/patient-advocacy-20150920-gjr53j.html |title=Patient advocacy services ensure optimum health outcomes |last1=Kamaker |first1=Dorothy |date=September 26, 2015 |website=smh.com.au |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |access-date=August 23, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Mississippi Law Journal''''' is a [[law review]] published at the [[University of Mississippi School of Law]]. It was established in 1928&lt;ref&gt;[http://mslj.law.olemiss.edu/background.html ''Mississippi Law Journal'': Background]&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Mississippi Bar Association]] and is the state's longest running law review. Originally published with the subtitle ''Journal of the State Bar Association,'' the ''Mississippi Law Journal'' is now independently published and is funded and operated almost exclusively through the income of its case briefing service, which provides succinct synopses of the decisions of the [[Mississippi Supreme Court]] and [[Mississippi Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mslj.law.olemiss.edu/briefing.html ''Mississippi Law Journal'': Briefing service]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11799">'''Nonrecourse debt''' or a '''nonrecourse loan''' (sometimes hyphenated as '''non-recourse''') is a [[secured loan]] (debt) that is [[security interest|secured]] by a pledge of [[collateral (finance)|collateral]], typically [[real property]], but for which the borrower is not personally liable.  If the borrower [[default (finance)|defaults]], the lender can seize and sell the collateral, but if the collateral sells for less than the debt, the lender cannot seek that deficiency balance from the borrower—its recovery is limited only to the value of the collateral. Thus, nonrecourse debt is typically limited to 50% or 60% [[loan-to-value ratio]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =U.S. new and existing home sales move in opposite directions in April|date=May 24, 2011 |accessdate=15 November 2013|publisher=Reed Construction Data| url= http://www.reedconstructiondata.com/market-intelligence/articles/u.s.-new-and-existing-home-sales-move-in-opposite-directions-in-april }}&lt;/ref&gt; so that the property itself provides "overcollateralization" of the loan.

The incentives for the parties are at an intermediate position between those of a full recourse secured loan and a totally unsecured loan. While the borrower is in first loss position, the lender also assumes significant risk, so the lender must [[Underwriting|underwrite]] the loan with much more care than in a full recourse loan. This typically requires that the lender have significant domain expertise and financial modeling expertise.

== Consumer finance ==
In Europe, mortgage loans secured by personal residences are usually recourse loans.&lt;ref name="cbo49"&gt;{{cite book | title= Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Role in the Secondary Mortgage Market | author= [[Congressional Budget Office]] | year= 2010 | page= 49 | url= http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=12032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most states in the United States also permit recourse for residential mortgages, but antideficiency statutes in a minority of states require nonrecourse mortgages.
Around 13 states can be classified as nonrecourse states, depending on a researcher's classification standards.&lt;ref&gt;Ghent, Andra C. and Kudlyak, Marianna, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1432437 "Recourse and Residential Mortgage Default: Theory and Evidence from U.S. States"] (July 10, 2009). [[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond]] Working Paper No. 09-10. The authors classify eleven states (Alaska, Arizona, California, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin) as nonrecourse. The authors also discuss the reasoning for this classification on a state-by-state basis. In several of the nonrecourse states some form of recourse is available but impractical due to lengthy and expensive judicial proceedings, jury trials, and extended redemption periods.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="olr_2010-R-0327"&gt;{{cite web|title= Comparison of State Laws on Mortgage Deficiencies and Redemption Periods  |date=29 July 2010| accessdate =24 August 2013 |url = http://www.cga.ct.gov/2010/rpt/2010-R-0327.htm}} The Connecticut Office of Legislative Research, relying on data from the [[National Consumer Law Center]], concluded that at least 10 states can be generally classified as nonrecourse for residential mortgages.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-directed [[Individual retirement account|IRA]] investors who choose to purchase investment real estate are able to leverage their purchase with a nonrecourse loan. Due to [[Internal Revenue Service]] regulations, it would be deemed a violation of the qualified retirement account status to personally guarantee any loan on real estate owned by a [[self-directed IRA]].

A [[PACE financing|Property Assessed Clean Energy]] (PACE) loan, used by some states to fund residential energy improvements, is an example of a loan that is nonrecourse to the borrower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/emerging-issues-residential-pace-loans-and-bankruptcy |title=Emerging Issues: Residential PACE Loans and Bankruptcy |website=natlawreview.com |date=2018-02-08 |accessdate=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial lending ==
Nonrecourse debt is typically used to finance commercial real estate, shipping, or other projects with high capital expenditures, long loan periods, and uncertain revenue streams. It is also commonly used for [[Securities lending|stock loans]] and other securities-collateralized lending structures. Since most commercial real estate is owned in a partnership structure (or similar tax pass-through), nonrecourse borrowing gives the real estate owner the tax benefits of a tax-pass-through partnership structure (that is, loss pass-through and no [[double taxation]]), and simultaneously limits personal liability to the value of the investment. A nonrecourse debt of $30 billion was issued to [[JPMorgan Chase]] by the [[Federal Reserve]] in order to purchase [[Bear Stearns]] on March 16, 2008. The nonrecourse loan was issued with Bear Stearns's less liquid assets as collateral, meaning that the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] will absorb the loss should the value of those assets be below their collateralized value.

The [[legal financing industry]] provides nonrecourse financial products used to provide financial assistance to plaintiffs involved in a [[Contingent fee|contingency]]-based lawsuit like a car accident. The funds are provided to the consumer on the potential [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] amount. This money is true nonrecourse funding, if the case is lost, one does not owe the company funding the lawsuit anything. This is a purchase of an asset and not a loan.

== Characterization in corporate finance ==
Nonrecourse debt is usually carried on a debtor company's [[balance sheet]] as a liability, and the collateral is carried as an asset. For [[Income tax in the United States|U.S. Federal income tax purposes]], the interaction among the concepts of (1) the "amount realized" upon a disposition, (2) the amount of nonrecourse debt, and (3) the amount of [[adjusted basis]] in the property is fairly complex. The tax consequences of a disposition depend on whether the taxpayer acquired the property with the nonrecourse debt already attached, or whether the taxpayer took out the nonrecourse debt after acquisition of the property, and the relative relationships between [[fair market value]] and purchase price and disposition price. Upon a sale or other disposition of property under U.S. income tax law, a taxable gain generally results where the amount realized upon the sale or other disposition of property exceeds the amount of the taxpayer's adjusted basis in that property.
 
Generally, the amount realized is the amount of cash and other consideration received by the taxpayer. The amount of any loan forgiven or discharged is generally part of that consideration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxalmanac.org/index.php/Internal_Revenue_Code:Sec._1001._Determination_of_amount_of_and_recognition_of_gain_or_loss "Determination of amount and recognition of gain or loss"], [[Taxalmanac.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[adjusted basis]] is the sum of the following:
* The amount of the original cost incurred by the taxpayer when the property was acquired, including the amount of any nonrecourse debt assumed by the owner/taxpayer as part of the acquisition (also known as "original basis"),
* Plus the costs of improvements (if any) made by the taxpayer to the property,
* Less the amount of depreciation (or similar) deductions allowed (or allowable) to the taxpayer on that property.

If the amount realized exceeds the amount of adjusted basis, the taxpayer has realized a gain at the time of disposition. If the adjusted basis exceeds the amount realized, a loss has been incurred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/us/cfr/title26/26-11.0.1.1.1.0.1.2.html Discharge of liabilities]&lt;/ref&gt; The federal income tax effect of nonrecourse debt may be explained by first considering the tax effect of a disposition involving [[Recourse note|recourse debt]] (that is, a debt in which the property provides first security coverage, and the borrower/taxpayer is personally liable for any deficiency that may remain after the lender forecloses against the property), and then contrasting against similar facts involving nonrecourse debt, as follows:

As an example, suppose: 
# The unpaid principal of the recourse debt is $100,000;
# The fair market value of the property is $80,000;
# The taxpayer's adjusted basis in the property is $45,000.

Assuming that the creditor forecloses on the property and that the $20,000 excess of the debt over the property's fair market value ($100,000 less $80,000) is contractually discharged (for didactic symmetry with the nonrecourse example, let's assume, contrary to the commercial point of a recourse loan, that the debt is outright forgiven by the creditor, with no actual payment), the taxpayer would realize the $20,000 amount as income from the discharge of indebtedness. That $20,000 of forgiveness would be taxable to the taxpayer as ordinary income even though the taxpayer received no cash at the time of the discharge.&lt;ref&gt;Unless the $20,000 qualifies as being excludable under {{usc|26|108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The $35,000 excess of the fair market value over the adjusted basis ($80,000 less $45,000) would be treated as a taxable capital gain on the "sale or other disposition" of the property—again, even though the taxpayer received no cash at the time of the foreclosure.

Assuming the same facts except that the debt is nonrecourse, the result would be quite different. The taxpayer would realize zero taxable ordinary income from the discharge of debt. Instead, the entire $55,000 difference between the unpaid principal of the debt and the taxpayer's adjusted basis ($100,000 less $45,000) would be treated as a taxable [[capital gain]] on the "sale or other disposition" of the property—again, even though no cash is received by the taxpayer at the time of foreclosure.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Commissioner v. Tufts]]'', 461 U.S. 300 (1983);  ''[[Crane v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue]]'', 331 U.S. 1 (1947).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the sale, foreclosure or other disposition, nonrecourse debt incurred as part of the financing of the acquisition, and money extracted from an investment by mortgaging out, are treated the same: both are taxable realization only at the time of the property's disposition,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Estate of Levine v. Commissioner]]'', 72 T.C. 780, 792 (1979), ''aff'd'', 634 F.2d 12 (1980) (a "nonrecourse mortgage debt is a debt of the property owner since he is, in reality, a quasi-obligor on the debt, notwithstanding the fact that the debt is owed by the property."); ''Woodsam Associates, Inc. v. Commissioner'', 16 T.C. 649 (1951), ''aff'd'', 198 F.2d 357 (2d Cir. 1952) (the excess of the amount of the debt over the adjusted basis of the property is gain, and will be treated as capital gain, subject to the rules on depreciation recapture).&lt;/ref&gt; even if, at time of disposition, the property is worth less than the amount of the mortgage. Nonrecourse debt that is in place at the time of acquisition of the property is included in basis, ''[[Crane v. Commissioner]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Crane v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue'', 331 U.S. 1 (1947).&lt;/ref&gt; subsequent borrowing is not. ''Woodsam Associates, Inc. v. Commissioner''.&lt;ref&gt;''Woodsam Associates, Inc. v. Commissioner'', 16 T.C. 649 (1951), ''aff'd'', 198 F.2d 357 (2d Cir. 1952).&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent borrowing proceeds reinvested in a depreciable property thereby avoid ''Woodsam'' and take advantage of ''Crane''.

In [[public policy]], '''outrage factor''' is public opposition to a policy that is not based on the knowledge of the technical details. The term "outrage factor" originates from Peter Sandman's 1993 book, ''Responding to Community Outrage: Strategies for Effective Risk Communication''.&lt;ref name="nebel"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Nebel|first=Bernard J.|author2=Richard T. Wright |title=Environmental science: the way the world works  |publisher=Prentice Hall PTR|year=1993 |edition=4th|pages=392–3|isbn=0-13-285446-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wjxeUeaRnMC&amp;lpg=PA393&amp;dq=%22OUTRAGE%20FACTOR%22&amp;pg=PA393#v=onepage&amp;q=%22OUTRAGE%20FACTOR%22&amp;f=false}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hird"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Hird |first=John A. |title=Superfund: the political economy of environmental risk |publisher=JHU Press|year=1994 |page=70|isbn=0-8018-4807-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fsTBXJPVmzgC&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=%22OUTRAGE%20FACTOR%22&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q=%22OUTRAGE%20FACTOR%22&amp;f=false}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

"Outrage factors" are the emotional factors that influence perception of risk. The risks that are considered involuntary, industrial and unfair are often given more weight than factors that are thought of as voluntary, natural and fair.

Sandman gives the formula:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
{{quote|Risk {{=}} Hazard + Outrage}}

== Risk communications ==
While [[policy analysis]] by institutional [[Stakeholder analysis|stakeholder]]s typically focuses on [[risk-benefit analysis]] and [[cost-benefit analysis]], popular [[risk perception]] is not informed by the same concerns. The successful implementation of a policy relying on public support and cooperation must address the outrage factor when informing the public about the policy.

In an interview with ''[[New York Times]]'' [[journalist]] and [[Freakonomics]] author [[Stephen J. Dubner]], Sandman emphasized "the most important truth in risk communication is the exceedingly low correlation between whether a risk is dangerous, and whether it's upsetting".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/11/29/risk-hazard-outrage-a-conversation-with-risk-consultant-peter-sandman/

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevance of public outrage has been acknowledged in discussions of various policy debates, including [[nuclear safety]],&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4523">The '''Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security''' (PJCIS) is a [[joint committee]] of the [[Parliament of Australia]] which oversees [[Australia]]'s primary agencies of the [[Australian Intelligence Community]]: [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] (ASIO), the [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service]] (ASIS), the [[Australian Signals Directorate]] (ASD), the [[Defence Intelligence Organisation]] (DIO), the [[Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation]] (DIGO), and the [[Office of National Assessments]] (ONA).

The Committee, then called the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, was established pursuant to the ''[[Intelligence Services Act 2001]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Intelligence Services Act 2001'', s.28&lt;/ref&gt; and was first appointed in March 2002.

==History==
The '''Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD''' (PJCAAD) was established pursuant to the ''[[Intelligence Services Act 2001]]'' and replaced the '''Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO''' (which was established in 1988) and the '''Joint Select Committee on the Intelligence Services'''. The PJCIS's purview was expanded from 1 July 2004 to include DIO, DIGO and ONA, following the recommendations of the Flood Inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nla.gov.au/gov/20140126040152/http://www.idis.gov.au/publications/intelligence_inquiry/index.htm Report of the Inquiry Into Australian Intelligence Agencies]&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December 2005, the name of the Committee was changed to the '''Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security''' (PJCIS). 

The members of the first Committee were appointed in March 2002.

==Functions==
The PJCIS's main function is administrative and expenditure review and oversight of ASIO, ASIS and DSD. The Committee can also review matters relating to the three agencies referred to them by Parliamentary Resolution, or by a request from the Minister responsible for the agency in question. The Committee does not review intelligence gathering or operational procedures or priorities, nor does it conduct inquiries into individual complaints about the activities of ASIO, ASIS or DSD.

==Membership==
The Committee consists of eleven members: five from the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and six from the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Six members are from the [[Government of Australia|Government]] and five from the [[Opposition (Australia)|Opposition]]. Serving ministers are not allowed to be members, but members may previously have held ministerial positions. Members of the committee cease to be members when Parliament is dissolved, and new members are appointed after the new Parliament convenes.

The members of the Committee as at 21 June 2017 were:&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, [http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Intelligence_and_Security/Committee_Membership Committee Membership]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1169">In certain [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions (e.g., [[France]], [[Quebec]], [[Mexico]], etc.), the '''patrimoine d'affectation''' is [[property]], assets, or a legal estate that can be divided for a fiduciary purpose, as being distinct from a person's general assets.  It is similar in some respects to the way under [[common law]] property is held, managed, or invested in [[Trust law|trust]] by a trustee for the benefit of third parties (beneficiaries). The affected property remains outside the grantor's assets; therefore, even if the grantor goes bankrupt, becomes insolvent, or incurs liabilities, the property remains untouchable and may continue to benefit the intended beneficiaries.

Originally proposed as a way of explaining the common law trust, the concept was first put forward by the French jurist Pierre Lepaulle&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Lepaulle, ''Traité théorique et pratique des trusts en interne, en droit fiscale international'' (Paris: Rousseau et Cie, 1932).&lt;/ref&gt; who based it on the German ''Zweckvermögen''.

[[File:Cartoon warning World's Fair attendees of price-gouging.jpg|thumb|1904 cartoon warning attendees of the [[St. Louis World's Fair]] of hotel room price gouging]]
'''Price gouging''' is a term referring to when a seller spikes the prices of [[good (economics)|goods]], services or commodities to a level much higher than is considered reasonable or fair, and is considered exploitative, potentially to an unethical extent. Usually this event occurs after a demand or supply shock: common examples include price increases of basic necessities after [[hurricanes]] or other [[natural disasters]]. In precise, legal usage, it is the name of a crime that applies in some jurisdictions  of the [[United States]] during civil emergencies. In less precise usage, it can refer either to prices obtained by practices inconsistent with a competitive [[free market]], or to [[windfall profits]]. In the former [[Soviet Union]], it was simply included under the single definition of [[speculation]].

The term is similar to [[Profiteering (business)|profiteering]] but can be distinguished by being short-term and localized, and by a restriction to essentials such as food, clothing, shelter, medicine and equipment needed to preserve life, limb and property.  In jurisdictions where there is no such crime, the term may still be used to pressure firms to refrain from such behavior.

The term is not in widespread use in [[Mainstream economics|mainstream economic theory]], but is sometimes used to refer to practices of a [[coercive monopoly]] which raises prices above the market rate that would otherwise prevail in a competitive environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/kudlow061400.asp |title=Lawrence Kudlow |website=Jewishworldreview.com |date=2000-06-14 |accessdate=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it may refer to suppliers' benefiting to excess from a short-term change in the [[demand curve]].

As a criminal offense, [[Florida]]'s "state of emergency" law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myfloridalegal.com/pages.nsf/Main/5D2710E379EAD6BC85256F03006AA2C5?OpenDocument |title=Florida Attorney General - Price Gouging Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Florida office of the [[attorney general]]|accessdate=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an example. Price gouging may be charged when a supplier of essential goods or services sharply raises the prices asked in anticipation of or during a civil emergency, or when it cancels or dishonors contracts in order to take advantage of an increase in prices related to such an emergency.  The model case is a retailer who increases the price of existing stocks of milk and bread when a hurricane is imminent.

In Florida, it is a defense to show that the price increase mostly reflects increased costs, such as running an emergency generator, or hazard pay for workers, while [[California]] places a ten percent cap on any increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2011/4/regv34n1-1.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Problem with Price Gouging Laws |website=Object.cato.org |accessdate=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws against price gouging==
In the United States, laws against price gouging have been held [[constitutional]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://louisville.bizjournals.com/louisville/stories/2009/10/05/daily21.html | work = Business First of Louisville | title = State’s anti-price-gouging law upheld | date = October 6, 2009 | accessdate = 2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the state level as a valid exercise of the [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] to preserve order during an emergency, and may be combined with anti-[[hoarding (economics)|hoarding]] measures. Exceptions are prescribed for price increases that can be justified in terms of increased cost of supply, transportation, demand or storage. Statutes generally give wide discretion not to prosecute: in 2004, Florida determined that one-third of complaints were unfounded, and a large fraction of the remainder was handled by [[consent decree]]s, rather than prosecution. As of 2008, laws against price-gouging have been enacted in 35 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://consumer.findlaw.com/consumer-transactions/price-gouging-laws-by-state.html|title=Price Gouging Laws by State|accessdate=2018-01-11|work=consumer.findlaw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Price-gouging is often defined in terms of three criteria listed below:&lt;ref name = zwolinski&gt;{{cite journal | author = M. Zwolinski |  title = The Ethics of Price Gouging | year = 2008 | volume = 3 | pages = 347–378 | journal = Business Ethics Quarterly | ssrn = 1099567 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Period of emergency: The majority of laws apply only to price shifts during a time of disaster.
# Necessary items: Most laws apply exclusively to items which are essential to survival.
# Price ceilings: Laws limit the maximum price that can be charged for given goods.

==Opposition to laws against price gouging==
Economists [[Thomas Sowell]] and [[Walter E. Williams]], among others, argue against laws that interfere with large or exorbitant price changes. According to this view, high prices can be viewed as information for use in determining the best allocation of scarce resources for which there are multiple uses.  Many libertarian economists oppose price gouging legislation and argue that it prevents goods from going to individuals who value them the most and not just to those with the greatest wealth. For example, after a storm has felled numerous trees in a locality, advocates of this theory claim that a rise in the price of chain saws will discourage their purchase by people with only a minor need for them, making them more available for those with the strongest need, rather than the most wealth. Problems during the [[Siege of Paris (1870–1871)]], which critics attribute to price restrictions, are often held up as another example. With price gouging laws in place, producers are only able to charge a price set by law, and therefore have little additional incentive to increase supply to adversely impacted areas. If producers are able to make extra profit, these theorists argue, then they will increase the supply. It is claimed that these laws lead to [[after-market]] operations as consumers with the lowest [[opportunity costs]] buy up desired resources and attempt to resell them to public at higher prices.

Critics claim that laws against price-gouging could discourage businesses from proactively preparing for a disaster. One example given in support of this view is that a business could install an expensive [[emergency power system]] for [[power outage]]s. However, if it is prohibited from large price increases, the costs cannot be recovered during the relatively short amount of time when there is no power. As a result, a business that proactively prepared could not compete with others that did not. (This is generally unnecessary for similar businesses in close proximity to one another.) According to this theory, the end result would be needless shortages and more hardship for the public, or under extreme circumstances, it could be deadly. To correct the situation, those opposed to price gouging laws argue that if not abolished entirely, laws would have to be amended to allow the [[amortization]] of equipment that is useful ''only'' during a disaster. Unlike amortizing for tax purposes, this would account for how equipment is sporadically paid off internally with the extra [[revenue]].

In support of the argument against price-gouging legislation, some assert that a similar situation applies to those who are outside of the disaster zone and willing to go there to sell what is desperately needed. If they are unable to recover their travel costs and be compensated for the inconvenience of staying in an inhospitable disaster zone, only the [[Altruism|altruistic]] few would bother to do so. Since most anti-price gouging laws are based on the pre-disaster selling price, a person who buys needed supplies at the retail level in an unaffected area will more easily run afoul of the law than a large wholesaler would. They assert that it would be the "little guy" who could lose more on a percentage basis, in addition to the possibility of hefty fines, rather than "big business."

Opponents of anti-price gouging laws also claim that in terms of [[fair value|fairness]], such laws could also require producers to sell goods below their [[market-clearing price]]: the market clearing price is the amount at which quantity supplied is equal to quantity demanded. According to this theory, if goods are priced above their market-clearing price then there will be a surplus of goods, and the converse leads to a shortage of goods. Thus, advocates of this theory claim that consumers would be unable to buy the necessary goods which they desire in a time of need.

According to the theory of [[neoclassical economics]], anti-price gouging laws prevent [[allocative efficiency]]. Allocative efficiency refers to when prices function properly, markets tend to allocate resources to their most valued uses. In turn those who value the good the most (and not just the wealthiest) will be willing to pay a higher price than those who do not value the good as much.&lt;ref name = zwolinski/&gt; According to Friedrich Hayek in ''The Use of Knowledge in Society'', prices can act to coordinate the separate actions of different people as they seek to satisfy their desires.&lt;ref&gt; Hayek, Friedrich A., ''The Use of Knowledge in Society''. 1945. Library of Economics and Liberty. 6 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1967, the aim of Release was to provide bail services to people arrested for drugs offences and to refer them to solicitors. A 24-hour telephone help line was set up and run by volunteers. Coon was the fundraiser and spokesperson for the organisation and Harris was the administrator. By the end of 1967 Release was based in an office at 50 Princedale Road, [[Holland Park]]. In its first two years, Release handled more than 2,000 cases.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901067,00.html|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |title=Britain's "Release"|date=1969-07-18|accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-profile clients included [[John Lennon]] and [[George Harrison]], who donated £5,000 in 1969.&lt;ref name="Abrams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

In 1969 Harris and Coon summarised their early work in ''The Release Report on Drug Offenders and the Law'', published by [[Sphere Books]].&lt;ref name="Abrams"/&gt;

Release gained charitable status in 1972, following a review of its activities by the [[Rowntree Foundation]]. By the mid-1970s, Release was supported directly by a [[Home Office]] grant, without compromising its libertarian principles.&lt;ref name="Abrams"/&gt;

The agency ran a London bus [[advertising campaign]] entitled "Nice People Take Drugs" in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/joepublic/2009/jun/04/drugs-do-work |title=The drugs do work – for a lot of people |date=4 June 2009 |author=Claudia Rubin |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2009-06-15 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was pulled a few day later, amidst claims of censorship by the advertising regulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jun/09/nice-people-drugs-ads-pulled |title='Nice people take drugs' ads pulled from London buses |date=9 June 2009 |author=Mary O'Hara |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2009-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Release remains the UK's only dedicated free legal and drugs advice service, offering a [[helpline]] for drug users and their families. Specialists offer advice both to the drugs industry and the general public. It continues to advocate treatment over punishment for drug users. Release has a long history of association with the heart of London and has been based in various premises around Old Street since the 1980s.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

[[File:2009-7-32 Pass, Safe Conduct, Vietnam, Obverse.jpg|thumb|Safe conduct pass, issued by American forces and air dropped in Vietnam to encourage defection of North Vietnamese and [[Viet Cong]] forces.]]

'''Safe conduct''' is the situation in time of international conflict or war where one state, a party to such conflict, issues to a person—usually an enemy state's subject—a pass or document to allow the [[enemy alien]] to traverse its territory without harassment, bodily harm, or fear of death. Safe conduct is only granted in exceptional circumstances. It may be given to an enemy to allow [[retreat (military)|retreat]] under [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] terms, or for a meeting to negotiate; to a [[stateless person]]; or to somebody who for some reason would normally not be able to pass.

The term 'safe conduct' is also used to mean the document authorizing this security.

In the early Middle Ages, during some periods of Islamic control of the [[Holy Land]], Christian pilgrims could request letters of safe conduct from a Muslim ruler allowing them to pass through their lands to [[Jerusalem]]. An example of safe conduct in the 20th century was [[Lenin]]'s "[[sealed train]]": a [[citizen]] of [[Russia]], a country at war with [[Germany]], Lenin was permitted to travel from his exile in [[Switzerland]] through Germany, without stopping, to return to Russia. It was in Germany's interest to allow this, for it was hoped that he would destabilize Russia. Another example would be the [[Chieu Hoi]] program during the [[Vietnam War]].

Often described in [[corporate governance]] or management theory as an [[agency problem]], a corporation's managers are likely to overpay themselves because, directly or indirectly, they are allowed to pay themselves as a matter of general management power.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in the UK, see [[Model Articles]] para 3; and under the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]], see s 141(a)&lt;/ref&gt; Directors are elected to a board that has a [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]] to protect the interests of the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in the UK, [[Companies Act 2006]], ss 170, 172&lt;/ref&gt; In large listed companies, executive compensation will usually be determined by a compensation committee composed of board members.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in the UK, see the [[Combined Code]] A.3.1; in the US, see the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) rules; in Germany see the [[German Corporate Governance Codex]]&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents argue that “say on pay” reforms strengthen the relationship between the [[board of directors]] and shareholders, ensuring that board members fulfill their fiduciary duty. [http://millstein.som.yale.edu/Davis_Say_on_Pay_Policy_Briefing.pdf] Critics of the policy believe that “say on pay” does not effectively or comprehensibly monitor compensation, and consider it to be reactionary policy rather than proactive policy, because it does not immediately affect the Board of Directors. Some argue it is counter-productive because it diminishes the authority of the Board of Directors. [http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/11485334/2/c_2984789] The effect of ‘say on pay’ measures can be binding or non-binding, depending on regulatory requirements or internal corporate policy as determined by proxy votes.&lt;ref&gt;David Orisson, '[http://www.leadingboards.com/blog/say-on-pay-new-tool-of-social-responsibility/ Say On Pay = New tool of Social Responsibility?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823072522/http://www.leadingboards.com/blog/say-on-pay-new-tool-of-social-responsibility/ |date=2013-08-23 }}'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Switzerland==
{{main|Swiss referendum "against corporate Rip-offs" of 2013}}

On the 3rd of March the Swiss voted by 69.7 per cent to ensure shareholders, pension funds and not banks, entirely control questions of executive pay. Shareholders must elect all members of a company's remuneration committee of all Swiss public listed companies. They further should receive annual votes on the identity of all members of the [[board of directors]]. The role that banks played in casting votes on other shareholders behalf has been abolished.

==Australia==
The [[Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Act 2011]] introduced in the [[Corporations Act 2001]] new sections 250R(2), 250U-V, so that if at two consecutive meetings over 25% of shareholders vote against the directors’ remuneration package, the directors have to stand for election again in 90 days.

==UK law==
{{see also|UK company law}}
Originally [[UK company law]] set a default rule that the remuneration of directors was to be set, binding, by the company's general meeting, under [[Table A]], article 54, attached to the [[Companies Act 1862]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/about/tableA/comm7Aug1862CoAct1862_P1.pdf Table A of the CA 1862 art 54]&lt;/ref&gt; Over time more and more companies gave the right to directors, which is the position found in the [[Model Articles]] for companies today, that remuneration of the directors shall be determined by the directors.

The United Kingdom was the forerunner in mandating that shareholders be allowed a ''non-binding'', or advisory vote on pay. In the UK, section 439 of the [[Companies Act 2006]] mandates a vote on director pay at the yearly accounts meeting. Directors are expected to have disclosed their remuneration package in a "Remuneration Report" (section 420). Failure to do this leads to fines.

In addition, UK law regulates more tightly a number of elements beyond basic director pay. Employee share schemes that directors have must be approved by ordinary resolution under the [[London Stock Exchange]] Listing Rule 9.4.1. Under the [[UK Corporate Governance Code]], with which all listed companies must comply or explain why they do not, a binding vote on approval of [[long-term incentive plan]]s is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;Combined Code B.2.4&lt;/ref&gt; Under section 188 of the Companies Act 2006 a [[shareholder resolution]] is necessary to approve a director’s contract lasting more than a 2-year term (reduced from approval beyond a 5-year term under the old Companies Act 1985, section 319). Lastly, frivolous categories of compensation are limited under section 215, by prohibiting payments for loss of office (i.e. no [[golden parachutes]]), except, under section 220, in respect of damages for existing obligations and pensions.

Although the say on pay provision in section 439 is not binding on the board, the message in UK law is influential, because company members have an unrestricted right to fire any director, with reasonable notice, under section 168. The debate, however, moved on to whether the vote should become binding.&lt;ref&gt;T Helm and R Wachman, '[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/07/david-cameron-fat-cat-pay David Cameron to curb 'fat cat' pay with people power]' (8 January 2012) The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; Changes were introduced in the [[Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013]] section 79 to make the overall policy of pay be capable of being rejected by shareholders, but that no specific right to determine the amount has yet been introduced.

==US law==
{{see also|United States corporate law}}
In the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] §951, a new say on pay provision was introduced. 

There had been several recent efforts to require Say on Pay resolutions in the United States. In 2007, the Chairman of the Financial Services Committee Rep. [[Barney Frank]] sponsored legislation that was passed by the House of Representatives, giving shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation. [http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/8946280?f=related] Then Senator [[Barack Obama]] authored a "Say on Pay" proposal, but his legislation stalled in the Senate. [http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/11037327/c_11036422] 

The economic crisis has affected corporate governance in the United States of America. The [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] (EESA), which established the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]], required say on pay resolutions at companies with outstanding funds from the TARP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonwatch.com/blog/2008/09/28/bailout-text-tarp-taxpayers-are-really-payin/]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], Senator [[Chris Dodd]] amended Section 111 of the EESA, and updated policy on Executive Compensation in Section 7. The amended legislation continued the "Say on Pay" policy established originally in the EESA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h1enr.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 2009, Treasury Secretary [[Timothy Geithner]] stated that companies that have received exceptional financial recovery assistance from the TARP fund would have to subject executive compensation to "Say on Pay" resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/tg15.htm U.S. Treasury News Release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530151237/https://treas.gov/press/releases/tg15.htm |date=2009-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 10, 2009, Secretary Geithner stated that the Administration supports "Say on Pay" legislation, and it would authorize the SEC authority to implement "Say on Pay" regulations at all companies, not only those that have outstanding funds from the TARP, contingent on Congressional approval.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/jun2009/db20090610_656281.htm?campaign_id=rss_daily Business Week June 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Treasury reconciled its proposals from February 4 with Congressional amendments to the EESA in the Final Interim Rule on TARP Standards for Compensation and Corporate Governance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.gov/press/releases/tg165.htm U.S. Treasury News Release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610213259/http://www.treasury.gov/press/releases/tg165.htm |date=2009-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 31, 2009, H.R. 3269, the "Corporate and Financial Institution Compensation Fairness Act of 2009" passed the House of Representatives. The House bill included a section that allowed for a 'say on pay' for all public institutions in the United States. Additionally, it had a provision for a shareholder vote on golden parachutes. In the Senate, Senator Charles Schumer had introduced the Shareholder Bill of Rights. The House and Senate bills were reconciled in a final bill that was signed by President Obama on July 21, 2010 called The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, only 2.6% of companies which voted on say on pay measures failed to pass them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semlerbrossy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/SBCG-SOP-2012-09-05.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329001924/http://www.semlerbrossy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/SBCG-SOP-2012-09-05.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EU proposals==
{{see also|EU company law}}
The [[European Union]] has remained tentative about harmonising rules on CEO pay. In the High Level Group of Company Law Experts' ''Final Report'' in 2002, they stated they would not wish to impose a requirement for voting EU wide, yet.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Some Member States require, or are considering requiring, a form of mandatory or advisory vote by 
shareholders on the remuneration policy.  We do not believe a shareholder vote on the remuneration policy generally should be an 
EU requirement, as the effects of such a vote can be different from Member State to Member State.  The important thing is that 
shareholders annually have the opportunity to debate the policy with the board.&lt;ref&gt;High Level Group of Company Law Experts, [http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/company/docs/modern/report_en.pdf ''Final Report''] (2002) p.65; from the EU Commission's [http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/company/modern/index_en.htm#background website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212120815/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/company/modern/index_en.htm#background |date=2008-02-12 }} on company law modernisation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, a different approach is taken to share schemes, which were recommended to be more closely scrutinised.

==German reforms==
{{Expand section|date=October 2009}}
The Coalition Government of Germany has recently passed reforming legislation to the [[Stock Corporation Act]] to introduce a non-binding say on pay.

==Examples of shareholder revolts==
Incidents at large UK companies in which shareholders have "revolted" against the size of pay awards given to board members, since the "say on pay" legislation was introduced.

*[[Vodafone]] shareholders voted 10% against, and 30% in abstention from £13m in shares for CEO Sir Chris Gent. (July 2001)
*[[Royal &amp; Sun Alliance]] shareholders voted 28% against a £250,000 retention bonus for CFO Julian Hance and £1.44m severance pay for CEO Bob Mendelsohn. The share price had just dropped. (May 2003)
*[[GlaxoSmithKline]] shareholders voted 50.72% (advisorily) against a £22m bonus salary and stock [[severance package]] for CEO [[Jean-Pierre Garnier]]. Chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said it was just the difference in culture to the US that was holding Britain back and they should accept it. The TUC had been lobbying pension funds. (May 2003)
*[[ITV Network|ITV]] shareholders were 40% against a £15m (£1.8m cash, rest shares) payoff to Chairman Michael Green. It was justified on the basis that he would have taken legal action were it not paid, because he was removed prior to the Carlton/Granada merger.
*[[Berkley (property company)|Berkley]] Managing Director and founder of the property company had 47% of shareholders vote against his £1.2m (out of a total £4.7m package) under a long term incentive scheme that he had not actually belonged to. (August 2003)
*[[Unilever]] Former chairman Niall Fitzgerald got £1.2m after profits fell. (April 2005)
*[[Tesco]] shareholders voted 15% against an £11.5m bonus on [[Sir Terry Leahy]]’s salary as CEO. It was linked to the success of the firm's Fresh &amp; Easy chain in the US. The [[Association of British Insurers]] and [[Pensions &amp; Investment Research Consultants Ltd|PIRC]] were against.

In the first year of mandatory shareholder advisory "say on pay" voting in the US, 37 Russell 3000 companies failed to receive majority support from shareholders.  In the second year of voting, 44 Russell 3000 companies have failed as of June 12, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semlerbrossy.com/sop/four-more-companies-fail-say-on-pay#.T9eCpbX-tBk Four more companies fail Say on Pay], Semler Brossy Consulting Group, June 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semlerbrossy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/SBCG-SOP-2012-06-06.pdf 2012 Say on Pay Results (as of June 6)]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Semler Brossy Consulting Group, June 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Companies include:

*[[Nabors Industries]] shareholders voted against "say on pay" in both 2011 and 2012 (75% opposition in 2012) given concerns over the company's high CEO pay and severance payments.

*[[Hewlett Packard]] failed a "say on pay" vote in 2011 in light of new CEO [[Léo Apotheker]]'s employment agreement and the company's stock performance.
*[[Citigroup]] failed "say on pay" with 55% opposition in 2012 after giving CEO [[Vikram Pandit]] three retention grants valued at $27.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semlerbrossy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SBCG-SOP-2012-04-251.pdf 2012 Say on Pay Results (as of April 25)]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Semler Brossy Consulting Group, April 25, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic skepticism==
[[Brian Cheffins]] of [[Cambridge University]] and [[Randall Thomas]] of [[Vanderbilt University]] predicted that a 'say on pay' could hold back sudden jumps, but it would not stop the general upward drift in pay rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=268992]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ryan Krause and colleagues argued that 'say on pay' offered little information to the board of directors beyond disapproval of CEO compensation not being in line with firm performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krause|first=Ryan|last2=Whitler|first2=Kimberly A.|last3=Semadeni|first3=Matthew|date=2014-02-01|title=Power to the Principals!

[[Image:Schist detail.jpg|thumb|Schist specimen showing the characteristic "scaly" schistose texture, caused by platy micas]]

'''Schist''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ʃ|ɪ|s|t}} {{respell|SHIST|'}}) is a medium-[[Metamorphism#Metamorphic_grades|grade]] [[metamorphic rock]].&lt;ref name="GeologyDictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/geology/glossarys.html#schist |title=Schist definition |work=Dictionary of Geology |accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schist has medium to large, flat, sheet-like grains in a preferred orientation (nearby grains are roughly parallel). It is defined by having more than 50% [[Crystal habit#List of crystal habits|platy]] and elongated minerals (such as micas or talc),&lt;ref name="Glossary"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfnSesBc-RgC&amp;pg=PA577&amp;dq=schist+definition+50%25+platy+-study&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xD75UrviN4O0hAfg8YCgBw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=schist%20definition%2050%25%20platy%20-study&amp;f=false | title=Glossary of Geology | publisher=Springer | author=Jackson J.A., Mehl J.P. &amp; Neuendorf K.K.E. | year=2005 | page=577 | isbn=9780922152766}}&lt;/ref&gt; often finely interleaved with quartz and [[feldspar]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge Guide"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SnianWtB5WgC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=schist+quartz+feldspar+interleaved&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LUT5UuqcJc-ThQeUxYGgCQ&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=schist%20quartz%20feldspar%20interleaved&amp;f=false | title=Cambridge Guide to Minerals, Rocks and Fossils | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | author=Bishop A.C., Woolley A.R. &amp; Hamilton W.R. | year=1999 | page=153 | isbn=9780521778817}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lamellar (flat, planar) [[mineral]]s include [[mica]]s, [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], [[talc]], [[hornblende]], [[graphite]], and others. [[Quartz]] often occurs in drawn-out grains to such an extent that a particular form called quartz schist is produced. Schist is often [[garnet]]iferous. Schist forms at a higher temperature and has larger grains than [[phyllite]].&lt;ref name=EG/&gt; Geological [[Foliation (geology)|foliation]] (metamorphic arrangement in layers) with medium to large grained flakes in a preferred sheetlike orientation is called ''schistosity''.&lt;ref name=EG&gt;Essentials of Geology, 3rd Ed, Stephen Marshak&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of various schists are derived from their mineral constituents. For example, schists primarily composed of [[biotite]] and [[muscovite]] are called mica schists.&lt;ref name="GeologyDictionary"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/693684089|title=Earth science|last=J.|first=Tarbuck, Edward|date=2012|publisher=Prentice Hall/Pearson|others=Lutgens, Frederick K.|isbn=0321688503|edition=13th|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|oclc=693684089}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most schists are mica schists, but graphite and chlorite schists are also common. Schists are also named for their prominent or perhaps unusual mineral constituents, as in the case of [[garnet]] schist, [[tourmaline]] schist, and [[glaucophane]] schist.

The individual [[mineral]] grains in schist, drawn out into flaky scales by heat and pressure, can be seen with the naked eye. Schist is characteristically ''foliated'', meaning that the individual mineral grains split off easily into flakes or slabs. The word schist is derived ultimately from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''σχίζειν'' (''schízein'') meaning "to split",&lt;ref name="OD"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/schist | title=Schist | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | work=English Dictionary | accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a reference to the ease with which schists can be split along the plane in which the platy minerals lie.

Most schists are derived from [[clay]]s and [[mud]]s that have passed through a series of metamorphic processes involving the production of [[shale]]s, [[slate]]s and [[phyllite]]s as intermediate steps. Certain schists are derived from fine-grained [[igneous rock]]s such as [[basalt]]s and [[tuff]]s.

==Historical mining terminology==
Before the mid-18th century, the terms slate, shale and schist  were not sharply differentiated by those involved with mining.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Raymond, Slate, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FpqFAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA78 A Glossary of Mining and Metallurigical Terms], American Institute of Mining Engineers, 1881, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of underground [[coal mining]], shale was frequently referred to as [[slate]] well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Albert H. Fay, Slate, [https://books.google.com/books?id=y6hCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA622 A Glossary of the Mining and Mineral Industry], United States Bureau of Mines, 1920, p. 622.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
During metamorphism, rocks which were originally sedimentary, igneous or metamorphic are converted into schists and [[gneiss]]es. If the composition of the rocks was originally similar, they may be very difficult to distinguish from one another if the metamorphism has been great. A [[quartz-porphyry]], for example, and a fine grained feldspathic sandstone, may both be converted into a grey or pink mica-schist.  Usually, however, it is possible to distinguish between sedimentary and igneous schists and gneisses. If, for example, the whole district occupied by these rocks has traces of bedding, [[clastic]] structure, or [[Unconformity|unconformability]], then it may be a sign that the original rock was sedimentary. In other cases [[Intrusive rock|intrusive]] junctions, chilled edges, contact alteration or porphyritic structure may prove that in its original condition a metamorphic gneiss was an igneous rock. The last appeal is often to the chemistry, for there are certain rock types which occur only as sediments, while others are found only among igneous masses, and however advanced the metamorphism may be, it rarely modifies the chemical composition of the mass very greatly. Such rocks as [[limestone]]s, [[Dolostone|dolomite]]s, [[quartzite]]s and aluminous shales have very definite chemical characteristics which distinguish them even when completely recrystallized.

The schists are classified principally according to the minerals they consist of and on their chemical composition. For example, many metamorphic limestones, marbles, and calc-schists, with crystalline dolomites, contain silicate minerals such as mica, [[tremolite]], [[diopside]], [[scapolite]], quartz and [[feldspar]]. They are derived from calcareous sediments of different degrees of purity. Another group is rich in quartz (quartzites, quartz schists and quartzose gneisses), with variable amounts of white and black mica, [[garnet]], feldspar, [[zoisite]] and [[hornblende]]. These were once sandstones and arenaceous rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th Edition, [http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/s/schists.html], retrieved December 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The graphitic schists may readily be believed to represent sediments once containing coal or plant remains; there are also schistose [[ironstone]]s ([[hematite]]-schists), but metamorphic beds of salt or [[gypsum]] are exceedingly uncommon. Among schists of igneous origin there are the silky calc-schists, the foliated [[Serpentine group|serpentine]]s (once [[ultramafic]] masses rich in [[olivine]]), and the white mica-schists, porphyroids and banded [[halleflinta]]s, which have been derived from [[rhyolite]]s, quartz-porphyries and felsic [[tuff]]s. The majority of mica-schists, however, are altered [[claystone]]s and shales, and pass into the normal sedimentary rocks through various types of [[phyllite]] and mica-slates.  They are among the most common metamorphic rocks; some of them are [[Graphite|graphitic]] and others calcareous. The diversity in appearance and composition is very great, but they form a well-defined group not difficult to recognize, from the abundance of black and white micas and their thin, foliated, schistose character. A subgroup is the [[andalusite]]-, [[staurolite]]-, [[kyanite]]- and [[sillimanite]]-schists which usually make their appearance in the vicinity of gneissose granites, and have presumably been affected by contact metamorphism.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|title=Petrology |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineering considerations==
In [[geotechnical engineering]] a schistosity plane often forms a [[Discontinuity (Geotechnical engineering)|discontinuity]] that may have a large influence on the mechanical behavior (strength, deformation, etc.) of rock masses in, for example, [[tunnel]], [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]], or [[Slope stability analysis|slope]] construction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2060">'''Strike for cause''' (also referred to as '''challenge for cause''' or '''removal for cause''') is a method of eliminating potential members from a [[jury]] panel in the United States.

During the [[jury selection]] process, after [[voir dire]], opposing attorneys may request removal of any juror who does not appear capable of rendering a fair and impartial verdict, in either determining guilt or innocence and/or a suitable punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Arbetman, Lee P. &amp; O'Brien, Edward L. ''Glencoe Street Law'', pg. 50,648. Glencoe/McGraw-Hill, New York, 2005. {{ISBN|0078600197}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example would be a potential juror in a murder case, where the sentencing options include the death penalty and a lesser sentence (such as life without parole), who states that s/he "would sentence a defendant to death if found guilty"; such a statement may indicate the person's unwillingness to fairly consider a life without parole sentence.

Unlike a [[peremptory challenge]] (the number of which are limited by the court during voir dire, and unless a [[Batson challenge]] is raised the challenge is automatically granted) there is no limit to the number of strikes for cause that attorneys on either side of a case can be granted.  However, also unlike a peremptory challenge, a strike for cause must state a specific reason (in the example above, the reason would be the juror's bias against a non-death penalty sentence) and be granted by the trial judge; often both attorneys and sometimes the judge will question the juror being challenged.

If one attorney moves to strike a juror for cause but the judge rejects the motion, the attorney may still use a peremptory challenge (if s/he has any remaining) to strike the juror, and on appeal may raise a claim that the motion should have been granted but, because it was not, the attorney had to either use a peremptory challenge or seat a biased juror.

'''Students for Free Culture''', formerly known as '''FreeCulture.org''', is an international student organization working to promote [[Free Culture movement|free culture]] ideals, such as cultural participation and access to information. It was inspired by the work of former Stanford, now Harvard, law professor [[Lawrence Lessig]], who wrote the book ''[[Free Culture (book)|Free Culture]]'', and it frequently collaborates with other prominent free culture [[NGO]]s, including [[Creative Commons]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], and [[Public Knowledge]].  Students for Free Culture has over 30 chapters on college campuses around the world,&lt;ref&gt;[http://freeculture.org/chapters/ FreeCulture.org], Students for Free Culture chapters&lt;/ref&gt; and a history of grassroots activism.

Students for Free Culture is sometimes referred to as "FreeCulture", "the Free Culture Movement", and other variations on the "free culture" theme, but none of those are its official name. It is officially Students for Free Culture, as set for in the new bylaws that were ratified by its chapters on October 1, 2007, which changed its name from FreeCulture.org to Students for Free Culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freeculture.org/blog/2007/10/01/results-of-freecultureorg-bylaws-voting/ FreeCulture.org], Students for Free Culture's new bylaws&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
Students for Free Culture has stated its goals in a "manifesto": 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The mission of the Free Culture movement is to build a bottom-up, participatory structure to society and culture, rather than a top-down, closed, proprietary structure. Through the democratizing power of digital technology and the Internet, we can place the tools of creation and distribution, communication and collaboration, teaching and learning into the hands of the common person -- and with a truly active, connected, informed citizenry, injustice and oppression will slowly but surely vanish from the earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freeculture.org/manifesto/ FreeCulture.org], Free Culture manifesto&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It has yet to publish a more "official" mission statement, but some of its goals are:
* decentralization of creativity—getting ordinary people and communities involved with art, science, journalism and other creative industries, especially through new technologies
* reforming copyright, patent, and trademark law in the public interest, ensuring that new creators are not stifled by old creators
* making important information available to the public

==Purpose==
According to its website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://freeculture.org/about/ FreeCulture.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/63gwDq6Yi?url=http://freeculture.org/about/ |date=December 5, 2011 }}, About Students for Free Culture&lt;/ref&gt; Students for Free Culture has four main functions within the free culture movement:
* Creating and providing resources for its chapters and for the general public
* Outreach to youth and students
* Networking with other people, companies and organizations in the free culture movement
* Issue advocacy on behalf of its members

==History==

===Initial stirrings at Swarthmore College===
Students for Free Culture had its origins in the Swarthmore Coalition for the Digital Commons (SCDC), a student group at [[Swarthmore College]]. The SCDC was founded in 2003 by students [[Luke Smith (activist)|Luke Smith]] and [[Nelson Pavlosky]], and was originally focused on issues related to [[free software]], [[digital restrictions management]], and [[treacherous computing]], inspired largely by the [[Free Software Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://phoenix.swarthmore.edu/2003-10-02/news/13240 SwarthMore.edu], "New group to fight RIAA, Microsoft" from the Swarthmore Phoenix,&lt;/ref&gt; After watching [[Lawrence Lessig]]'s OSCON 2002 speech entitled "free culture"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lessig.org/freeculture/|title=FreeCulture.org crosses 13 - Lessig|first=Lawrence|last=Lessig|publisher=|access-date=June 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, they expanded the club's scope to cover cultural participation in general (rather than just in the world of software and computers), and began tackling issues such as copyright reform. In September 2004, SCDC was renamed [[Free Culture Swarthmore]], laying the groundwork for Students for Free Culture and making it the first existing chapter.

===OPG v. Diebold case===
Within a couple of months of founding the SCDC, Smith and Pavlosky became embroiled in the controversy surrounding Diebold Election Systems (now [[Premier Election Solutions]]), a voting machine manufacturer accused of making bug-ridden and insecure electronic voting machines.  The SCDC had been concerned about electronic voting machines using proprietary software rather than open source software, and kept an eye on the situation.  Their alarm grew when a copy of Diebold's internal e-mail archives leaked onto the Internet, revealing questionable practices at Diebold and possible flaws with Diebold's machines, and they were spurred into action when Diebold began sending legal threats to voting activists who posted the e-mails on their websites.  Diebold was claiming that the e-mails were their copyrighted material, and that anyone who posted these e-mails online was infringing upon their intellectual property.  The SCDC posted the e-mail archive on its website and prepared for the inevitable legal threats.

Diebold sent [[Wikipedia:DMCA takedown notice|takedown]] notices under the [[DMCA]] to the SCDC's [[Internet service provider|ISP]], Swarthmore College.  Swarthmore took down the SCDC website, and the SCDC co-founders sought legal representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/03/business/file-sharing-pits-copyright-against-free-speech.html|title=File Sharing Pits Copyright Against Free Speech|date=3 November 2003|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contacted the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] for help, and discovered that they had an opportunity to sign on to an existing lawsuit against Diebold, [[OPG v. Diebold]], with co-plaintiffs from a non-profit ISP called the [[Online Policy Group]] who had also received legal threats from Diebold.  With pro bono legal representation from EFF and the [[Stanford Cyberlaw Clinic]], they sued Diebold for abusing copyright law to suppress freedom of speech online.  After a year of legal battles, the judge ruled that posting the e-mails online was a [[fair use]], and that Diebold had violated the DMCA by misrepresenting their copyright claims over the e-mails.

The network of contacts that Smith and Pavlosky built during the lawsuit, including dozens of students around the country who had also hosted the Diebold memos on their websites, gave them momentum they needed to found an international student movement based on the same free culture principles as the SCDC.  They purchased the domain name [http://freeculture.org Freeculture.org] and began building a website, while contacting student activists at other schools who could help them start the organization.

===FreeCulture.org launching at Swarthmore===
On April 23, 2004, Smith and Pavlosky announced the official launch of FreeCulture.org,&lt;ref&gt;[http://freeculture.org/blog/2004/04/13/swarthmore-students-to-launch/ FreeCulture.org], Students for Free Culture blog: Official Launch&lt;/ref&gt; in an event at Swarthmore College featuring Lawrence Lessig as the keynote speaker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/LessigAtSwarthmore|title=Lessig speaks at Swarthmore|first=|last=Nelson Pavlosky|date=1 January 2004|publisher=|access-date=June 25, 2016|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/November-December-2004/feature_hunter_novdec04.msp LegalAffairs.org], Legal Affairs article on the launch&lt;/ref&gt; (Lessig had released his book [[Free Culture (book)|Free Culture]] less than a month beforehand.)  The SCDC became the first Freeculture.org chapter (beginning the process of changing its name to Free Culture Swarthmore), and students from other schools in the area who attended the launch went on to found chapters on their campuses, including [[Bryn Mawr College]] and [[Franklin and Marshall]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,65616,00.html Wired.com], Wired News - "Students Fight Copyright Hoarders"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet campaigns===
FreeCulture.org began by launching a number of internet campaigns, in an attempt to raise its profile and bring itself to the attention of college students.  These have covered issues ranging from defending artistic freedom ([http://barbieinablender.org/ Barbie in a Blender]) to fighting the [[Induce Act]] (Save The iPod), from celebrating [[Creative Commons]] licenses and the [[public domain]] ([http://undeadart.org Undead Art]) to opposing [[business method patent]]s ([http://freeculture.org/cereal Cereal Solidarity]).  While these one-shot websites succeeded in attracting attention from the press and encouraged students to get involved, they didn't directly help the local chapters, and the organization now concentrates less on web campaigns than it did in the past.  However, their recent [http://freeculture.org/blog/2006/10/13/contestwinners/ Down With DRM video contest] was a successful "viral video" campaign against [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]], and internet campaigns remain an important tool in free culture activism.

===Increased emphasis on local chapters===
Today{{When|date=June 2016}} the organization focuses on providing services to its local campus chapters, including web services such as mailing lists and wikis, pamphlets and materials for tabling, and organizing conferences where chapter members can meet up. Active chapters are located at schools such as [[New York University]] (NYU), [[Harvard]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Fordham Law]], [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], [[University of Florida]], [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], [[Emory University|Emory]], [[Reed College|Reed]], and [[Yale University|Yale]].

The NYU chapter made headlines when it began protesting outside of record stores against DRM on CDs during the [[Sony rootkit]] scandal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/computersecurity/2005-11-13-digital-rights_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Firestorm rages over lockdown on digital music|publisher=|access-date=June 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in similar protests around New York and Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/view.php?id=11669 "Copy Cats"], PhiladelphiaWeekly.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] chapter developed and released [[YouTomb]], a website to track videos removed by [[DMCA takedown]] from [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V128/N37/youtomb.html|title=YouTomb Takes Stock of YouTube Takedowns|last=Guo|first=Jeff|accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other activities at local chapters include:
* art shows featuring [[Creative Commons]]-licensed art,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeculturenyu.org/ccartshow/ FreeCultureNYU.org], NYU's CC art show&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharingisdaring.org/ SharingIsDaring.org], "Sharing is Daring" CC art show at Harvard&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[mix CD]]-exchanging [[flash mobs]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://freeculture.org/blog/2006/05/18/santa-cruz-flash-mob-f2fp2p-mix-cd-exchange/ FreeCulture.org], Santa Cruz "face to face peer to peer" flashmob&lt;/ref&gt;

* a campaign to promote [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] on university campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeculturenyu.org/oa FreeCulture.org], FreeCulture Taking Action on Open Access&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
Students for Free Culture began as a loose confederation of student groups on different campuses, but it has been moving towards becoming an official tax-exempt non-profit.

With the passage of official bylaws, Students for Free Culture now has a clear governance structure which makes it accountable to its chapters.  The supreme decision-making body is the Board of Directors, which is elected once a year by the chapters, using a [[Schulze method]] for voting.  It is meant to make long-term, high-level decisions, and should not meddle excessively in lower-level decisions.  Practical everyday decisions will be made by the Core team, composed of any students who are members of chapters and meet the attendance requirements.  Really low-level decisions and minutiae will be handled by a coordinator, who ideally will be a paid employee of the organization, and other volunteers and assistants.  A new board of directors was elected in February 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://freeculture.org/blog/2008/02/06/board-election-results/ FreeCulture.org], Spring 2008 Board Election results&lt;/ref&gt; and a new Core Team was assembled shortly thereafter.  There is no coordinator yet.{{When|date=June 2016}}

'''Trespass''' '''''vi et armis''''' was a kind of lawsuit at [[common law]] called a [[tort]].  The cause of action alleged a trespass upon person or property ''vi et armis'', [[Latin]] for "by force and arms."  The plaintiff would allege in a [[plea]]ding that the act committing the offense was "immediately injurious to another's property, and therefore necessarily accompanied by some degree of force; and by special action ''on the case'', where the act is in itself indifferent and the injury only consequential, and therefore arising without any breach of the peace."&lt;ref&gt;Lord [[William Blackstone]], ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', Vol. 3 p. 153.[https://books.google.com/books?id=2UcOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus it was "immaterial whether the injury was committed willfully or not."&lt;ref&gt;''Taylor v. Rainbow'', 2 Hen &amp; M. 423&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Taylor v. Rainbow'', the defendant negligently discharged a firearm in a public place and caused the loss of the plaintiff's leg.  The defendant was held to be liable for medical bills as well as lost earnings as a result of the disability.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, proof that the act or omission was unintended was no defense to an action of trespass ''vi et armis'' and the liable party would pay for all consequent damages.

Recovery for damages for a trespass ''vi et armis'' were limited only to the direct consequences of the act or omission causing the injury.  For instance, the state of [[West Virginia]] reported that monetary loss for detention from business as an indirect result of the injury were not recoverable under an action for trespass ''vi et armis'', but were available under the related action of [[trespass on the case]], also known as an action ''ex delicto'' "against the wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Barnum v. B. &amp; O. Railroad Co., 5 W. Va. 10&lt;/ref&gt; 

Trespass ''vi et armis'' was a precursor to many other forms of lawsuits at common law.  The cause came to be formulaic and in many cases fictitious.  For instance, a lawsuit against a defendant had spoiled wine with salt water required an allegation that he had done so with bows and arrows.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''Rattlesdene v. Grunestone'' (1317).&lt;/ref&gt;  The ancient courts at common law developed trespass upon the case as an alternative pleading to causes of action which arose neither from force nor weapons.  In modern times, the specific formalities of the distinction between the two have dropped in favor of [[notice pleading]] or code pleading and actions for [[negligence]], [[Battery (tort)|battery]], [[trespass to chattels]], and [[conversion (law)|conversion]]. 
 
The related phrase of '''''contra pacem regis''''', "against [[Queen's peace|the King's peace]]", was necessarily not a required element of trespass ''vi et armis'' although it was possible for both allegations to appear in a lawsuit when the intentional use of force or weapons breached the peace.

'''Sheikh Yasser al-Habib''' (Arabic: ياسر الحبيب born 20 January 1979) is a [[Muslim]] [[Shia]] cleric, the founder and the head of the London-based Khoddam Al-Mahdi Organization, as well as Al-Muhassin mosque in [[Fulmer|Fulmer, Buckinghamshire]]. Al-Habib attempts to express his religious views and his investigations and conclusions in the Islamic history, based upon Shia and allegedly Sunni sources. 

Al-Habib started his religious activities in Kuwait, starting off as a member of the Dawah Party, later he founded a non-profit religious organization named Khoddam Al-Mahdi Organization, and he also expressed his religious views regarding [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]], and criticized them sharply, which led to anger the mainstream [[Sunnis]] in Kuwait and other Arabic-speaking Sunni communities, and finally led to the arrest of Al-Habib. Later, in February 2004 he was released under an annual pardon announced by the [[Amir]] of Kuwait on the occasion of the country's [[National Day#Kuwait|National Day]], but his rearrest was ordered a few days later. Al-Habib fled Kuwait before he was sentenced [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] to 10 years' imprisonment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/annualreport.php?id=ar&amp;yr=2005&amp;c=KWT |title=International Religious Freedom Report 2004 - Kuwait |publisher=Amnestyusa.org |date= |accessdate=27 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218151217/http://www.amnestyusa.org/annualreport.php?id=ar&amp;yr=2005&amp;c=KWT |archivedate=18 February 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and spent months in Iraq and Iran before gaining an asylum in [[United Kingdom]] which is his current place of residence.

== Early life ==
Al-Habib was interviewed by [[Elaph]], a well-known Arabic online newspaper, where he stated that he was born in a religious Kuwaiti family, and started his education in the Kuwaiti governmental schools, before joining [[Kuwait University]] and graduating from its Political sciences faculty. Besides his secular studies, Al-Habib stated that he studied the traditional Islamic under the guidance of his teacher [[Mohammed Reza Shirazi|Ayatollah Mohammed Reza Shirazi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.elaph.com/Web/news/2010/11/614420.html |script-title=ar:ياسر الحبيب: هذه قصة خروجي من السجن.. والمستقبل للتشيع |publisher=Elaph |date= |accessdate=2 February 2014|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, he founded Khoddam Al-Mahdi Organization at [[Kuwait]] and In 2003, Al-Habib was sentenced to 35 years in prison in Kuwait for insulting Aisha and Sunni caliphs, who are revered in [[Sunni Islam]]. However, his imprisonment was cut short in 2004  on the occasion of the country's [[National Day#Kuwait|National Day]], but his rearrest was ordered a few days later. He fled the country first to Iraq, then to Iran. Then he went to London where Seyed [[Mojtaba Hosseini Shirazi]], younger brother of [[Sadiq Hussaini Shirazi|Sadiq Shirazi]], has lived for forty years. Finally he could get asylum in Britain.&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/meet-the-controversial-shia-cleric-bringing-sectarian-tension-to-the-uk | title=Meet the Controversial Cleric Threatening to Turn UK Muslims Against Each Other | date=10 May 2013 | accessdate=25 February 2015 | author=Omar Shahid and Tamanna Ali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He recorded two lectures in English titled: ''Who killed the Prophet Muhammad'' and ''Why do Shiites hate [[Umar]] Ibn al-Khattab''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alqatrah.net/en/video-y/index.php?catb=5&amp;part=1 |title=The drop, Office of Sheikh Al-Habib in London - Video Youtube |publisher=Alqatrah.net |date= |accessdate=27 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917085608/http://alqatrah.net/en/video-y/index.php?catb=5&amp;part=1 |archivedate=17 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wahhabism ===
Al-Habib said: {{cquote|Wahhabism is a criminal and violent ideology, founded by a mentally ill man named Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab about three centuries ago. Its main principle is that all Muslims who perform [[Tawassul ]] and visit their graves are regarded as apostates and infidels. Therefore, the seizure of their life, property and women would, like that of the infidels, be religiously lawful and permissible!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-drop.net/en/question/index.php?id=42 |title=The drop, Office of Sheikh Al-Habib in London - Answers - What do Wahhabis believe in |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724094102/http://www.the-drop.net/en/question/index.php?id=42 |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Views on Sunnis ===
Sheikh al-Habib refers to Sunnis as [[Bakriyyah|Bakris]], meaning the followers of Abu Bakr. He says that the real Sunnis (''Ahlul Sunnah'') are the ones who follow the [[Sunnah]] of Muhammad, that is Shia Muslims. He continues that Sunnis today follow the Sunnah and teachings of Abu Bakr instead, having rejected [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]] and [[Ahlulbayt]]. He explains in one of his lectures titled ''Bakris think they are Sunnis, but in reality are not'' that when people wanted to distance themselves from the Shia, and follow [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyya]], they started calling themselves the Jama'ah. He explains that the reality behind why people called themselves [[Sunnis|Ahlul Sunnah wal Jama'ah]] only began after the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] ruler [[Umar bin Abdul Aziz]] forbade the Sunnah (tradition) of cursing [[Ali bin Abi Talib]] publicly (as previously invented by the [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah]]). It was upon then that people protested to this new prohibition, declaring that [[Umar bin Abdul Aziz]] had prohibited the Sunnah of cursing [[Ali bin Abi Talib]]. Thus they began calling themselves Ahlul Sunnah wal Jama'ah; stressing that they adhere to the Sunnah of cursing [[Ali bin Abi Talib]], and that they are the Jama'ah of [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah]].

He also refers to those personalities who claim that they belong to [[Shi'a]] but reconcile with the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] sect as Batris.

He described [[Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah]] (the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[Marja'|marja]] who died on 4 July 2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=116761#ixzz0sr3wTEpL |title=Politics - Tuesday official mourning day for Fadlallah |publisher=The Daily Star |date=6 July 2010 |accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Batri. Al-Habib said that Fadlallah left a great number of doctrinal deviations, ignorant views and bad conduct which he introduced to the religion of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alqatrah.net/en/edara/index.php?id=102 |title=The drop, Office of Sheikh Al-Habib in London - Sheikh al-Habib Hails our Great Scholars’ Refusal to pay tribute to Fadlullah |publisher=Alqatrah.net |date= |accessdate=27 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917055848/http://alqatrah.net/en/edara/index.php?id=102 |archivedate=17 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010 [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Iranian Supreme Leader]] [[Ali Khamenei]] tried to calm tensions between Shias and Sunnis by issuing a [[fatwa]] against insulting Muhammad's companions and wives.&lt;ref name="Islam Times"/&gt; 
{{quote|Cursing the wives of the prophets and the wives of the Great Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is one of the taboos and prohibitions.&lt;ref name="Islam Times"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.islamtimes.org/en/doc/article/39715/fatwa-closes-the-doors-in-front-of-any-sedition-between-sunnis-and-shiites | title=Fatwa closes the doors in front of any sedition between the Sunnis and the Shiites | publisher=Islam Times | date=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Criticism ==
After Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei issued the fatwa outlawing the insult of Sunni Dignitaries (Aisha, Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattāb),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/Index_view.asp?code=227879 |title=Tehran Times |publisher=tehrantimes.com |date= |accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Habib responded by calling the Islamic Republic of Iran "oppressive". He continued by referring to [[Ali Khamenei|Khamenei]] as "so-called Ali al-Khamenei – who pretends to be a Shia scholar". His reasoning for naming the Iranian government as "oppressive" was because the "regime in Iran today unjustly arrests anyone who celebrates the occasion of Farhat-ul-Zahra and prevents people from visiting the tomb of [[Pirouz Nahavandi|Abu Lulu]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alqatrah.org/en/edara/index.php?id=123 |title=The drop, Office of Sheikh Al-Habib in London - Sheikh al-Habib takes an oath to 'publicly' voice opposition to the enemies of Ahlul Bayt and warns al-Khamenei |publisher=Alqatrah.net |date= |accessdate=24 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025093456/http://alqatrah.org/en/edara/index.php?id=123 |archivedate=25 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior Iranian cleric [[Naser Makarem Shirazi]] has referred to Al-Habib as a "hired agent or a mad man" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alqatrah.net/en/edara/index.php?id=122 |title=The drop, Office of Sheikh Al-Habib in London - Sheikh al-Habib remarks on Naser Makarem Shirazi's statement |publisher=Alqatrah.net |date= |accessdate=18 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025213853/http://alqatrah.net/en/edara/index.php?id=122 |archivedate=25 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated: "Recently an illiterate fool non clergy U.K citizen in the name of Shia has insulted sacred matters of Sunni Muslim brothers".&lt;ref name=" ABNA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abna24.com/english/cultural/archive/2010/10/05/207567/story.html | title=Grand Shia Cleric Calls "Yaser Alhabib" a Fool | publisher=ABNA | date=5 October 2010 | author=Staff writer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Habib has been criticized by several figures and leaders who speak in the name of [[Shiism]] including Ammar Nakshawani, leader of [[Hezbollah]] [[Hassan Nasrallah]], [[Ali Khamenei]] (who also issued a fatwa against cursing of Muhammad's companions) and [[Naser Makarem Shirazi]].

== Response == 
Sheikh maintains that all he does is teach the Islam as it was and should be, something that was historically disorded by Sunnis and Iran since 1979, especially under the Khamenei.
