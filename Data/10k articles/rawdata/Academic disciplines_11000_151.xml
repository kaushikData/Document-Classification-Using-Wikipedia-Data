Researchers study abiogenesis through a combination of [[molecular biology]], [[paleontology]], [[astrobiology]], [[oceanography]], [[biophysics]], [[geochemistry]] and [[biochemistry]], and aim to determine how pre-life [[chemical reaction]]s gave rise to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voet|Voet|2004|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of abiogenesis can be [[geophysics|geophysical]], [[Chemistry|chemical]], or [[biology|biological]],&lt;ref name="Dyson 1999"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; with more recent approaches attempting a synthesis of all three,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Davies, Paul |date= 1998 |title= The Fifth Miracle, Search for the origin and meaning of life |publisher= Penguin |page= | isbn= }}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as life arose under conditions that are strikingly different from those on Earth today. Life functions through the specialized chemistry of [[carbon]] and [[water]] and builds largely upon four key families of chemicals: [[lipids]] (fatty cell walls), [[carbohydrates]] (sugars, cellulose), [[amino acid]]s (protein metabolism), and [[nucleic acids]] (self-replicating DNA and RNA). Any successful theory of abiogenesis must explain the origins and interactions of these classes of molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= Ward, Peter|author2= Kirschvink, Joe |date= 2015 |title= A New History of Life: the radical discoveries about the origins and evolution of life on earth |publisher= Bloomsbury Press |pages= 39–40 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many approaches to abiogenesis investigate how [[Self-replication|self-replicating]] [[molecule]]s, or their components, came into existence. Researchers generally think that current life on Earth descends from an [[RNA world]],&lt;ref name="RNA" /&gt; although [[RNA]]-based life may not have been the first life to have existed.&lt;ref name="Robertson2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cech2012" /&gt;

The classic 1952 [[Miller–Urey experiment]] and similar research demonstrated that most amino acids, the chemical constituents of the [[protein]]s used in all living organisms, can be synthesized from [[inorganic compound]]s under conditions intended to replicate those of the [[History of Earth|early Earth]]. Scientists have proposed various external sources of energy that may have triggered these reactions, including [[lightning]] and [[radiation]].

{{Life timeline}}
The Hadean Earth is thought to have had a [[secondary atmosphere]], formed through [[Degasification|degassing]] of the rocks that accumulated from [[planetesimal]] [[impact event|impactors]]. At first, it was thought that the Earth's [[atmosphere]] consisted of hydrogen compounds—[[methane]], [[ammonia]] and [[Water vapor|water vapour]]—and that life began under such [[redox|reducing]] conditions, which are conducive to the formation of organic molecules. According to later models, suggested by study of ancient minerals, the atmosphere in the late Hadean period consisted largely of [[water vapour]], [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon dioxide]], with smaller amounts of [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen]], and [[sulfur]] compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kasting |first=James F. |authorlink=James Kasting |date=12 February 1993 |title=Earth's Early Atmosphere |url=http://wwwdca.iag.usp.br/www/material/fornaro/ACA410/Kasting%201993_EarthEarlyAtmos.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Science |volume=259 |issue=5097 |pages=920–6 |doi=10.1126/science.11536547 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=11536547 |accessdate=2015-07-28 |ref=harv |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010074651/http://wwwdca.iag.usp.br/www/material/fornaro/ACA410/Kasting%201993_EarthEarlyAtmos.pdf |archivedate=10 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During its formation, the Earth lost a significant part of its initial mass, with a nucleus of the heavier rocky elements of the protoplanetary disk remaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fesenkov|1959|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, Earth lacked the [[gravity]] to hold any molecular hydrogen in its atmosphere, and rapidly lost it during the Hadean period, along with the bulk of the original inert gases. The solution of carbon dioxide in water is thought to have made the seas slightly [[acid]]ic, giving it a [[pH]] of about 5.5.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The atmosphere at the time has been characterized as a "gigantic, productive outdoor chemical laboratory."&lt;ref name="Follmann2009" /&gt; It may have been similar to the mixture of gases released today by volcanoes, which still support some abiotic chemistry.&lt;ref name="Follmann2009" /&gt;

The Hadean environment would have been highly hazardous to modern life. Frequent collisions with large objects, up to {{convert|500|km|mi}} in diameter, would have been sufficient to sterilize the planet and vaporize the ocean within a few months of impact, with hot steam mixed with rock vapour becoming high altitude clouds that would completely cover the planet. After a few months, the height of these clouds would have begun to decrease but the cloud base would still have been elevated for about the next thousand years. After that, it would have begun to rain at low altitude. For another two thousand years, rains would slowly have drawn down the height of the clouds, returning the oceans to their original depth only 3,000 years after the impact event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sleep |first=Norman H. |last2=Zahnle |first2=Kevin J. |authorlink2=Kevin J.

Studies of [[meteorite]]s suggests that [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] such as [[aluminium-26]] with a [[half-life]] of 7.17×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (717 thousand) years, and [[potassium-40]] with a half-life of 1.250×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; (1.25 billion) years, isotopes mainly produced in [[supernova]]e, were much more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2007|pp=61–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal heating as a result of [[Convection#Gravitational or buoyant convection|gravitational sorting]] between the [[Earth core|core]] and the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] would have caused a great deal of [[mantle convection]], with the probable result of many more smaller and more active tectonic plates than now exist.

The time periods between such devastating environmental events give time windows for the possible origin of life in the early environments. If the deep marine hydrothermal setting was the site for the origin of life, then abiogenesis could have happened as early as 4.0 to 4.2&amp;nbsp;Ga.

== Conceptual history ==

=== Spontaneous generation ===
{{Main|Spontaneous generation}}
Belief in spontaneous generation of certain forms of life from non-living matter goes back to [[Aristotle]] and [[ancient Greek philosophy]] and continued to have support in Western scholarship until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sheldon|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief was paired with a belief in heterogenesis, i.e., that one form of life derived from a different form (e.g., bees from flowers).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vartanian|1973|pp=307–312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical notions of spontaneous generation held that certain complex, living organisms are generated by decaying organic substances. According to Aristotle, it was a readily observable truth that [[aphid]]s arise from the dew that falls on plants, [[fly|flies]] from putrid matter, mice from dirty hay, crocodiles from rotting logs at the bottom of bodies of water, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lennox|2001|pp=229–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, people began to question such assumptions. In 1646, [[Thomas Browne|Sir Thomas Browne]] published his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' (subtitled ''Enquiries into Very many Received Tenets, and commonly Presumed Truths''), which was an attack on false beliefs and "vulgar errors." His contemporary, [[Alexander Ross (writer)|Alexander Ross]], erroneously refuted him, stating: "To question this [spontaneous generation], is to question Reason, Sense, and Experience: If he doubts of this, let him go to ''[[Egypt|Ægypt]]'', and there he will finde the fields swarming with mice begot of the mud of ''[[Nile|Nylus]]'', to the great calamity of the Inhabitants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Balme |first=D. M. |authorlink=David Mowbray Balme |year=1962 |title=Development of Biology in Aristotle and Theophrastus: Theory of Spontaneous Generation |journal=[[Phronesis (journal)|Phronesis]] |volume=7 |issue=1–2 |pages=91–104 |doi=10.1163/156852862X00052 |issn=0031-8868}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|1652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1665, [[Robert Hooke]] published the first drawings of a [[microorganism]]. Hooke was followed in 1676 by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], who drew and described microorganisms that are now thought to have been [[protozoa]] and [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dobell|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many felt the existence of microorganisms was evidence in support of spontaneous generation, since microorganisms seemed too simplistic for [[sexual reproduction]], and [[asexual reproduction]] through [[mitosis|cell division]] had not yet been observed. Van Leeuwenhoek took issue with the ideas common at the time that fleas and lice could spontaneously result from [[putrefaction]], and that frogs could likewise arise from slime. Using a broad range of experiments ranging from sealed and open meat incubation and the close study of insect reproduction he became, by the 1680s, convinced that spontaneous generation was incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bondeson|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first experimental evidence against spontaneous generation came in 1668 when [[Francesco Redi]] showed that no [[maggot]]s appeared in meat when flies were prevented from laying eggs. It was gradually shown that, at least in the case of all the higher and readily visible organisms, the previous sentiment regarding spontaneous generation was false. The alternative seemed to be [[biogenesis]]: that every living thing came from a pre-existing living thing (''omne vivum ex ovo'', Latin for "every living thing from an egg").

In 1768, [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] demonstrated that [[microorganism|microbes]] were present in the air, and could be killed by boiling. In 1861, [[Louis Pasteur]] performed a series of experiments that demonstrated that organisms such as bacteria and fungi do not spontaneously appear in sterile, nutrient-rich media, but could only appear by invasion from without.

The belief that self-ordering by spontaneous generation was impossible begged for an alternative. By the middle of the 19th century, the theory of biogenesis had accumulated so much evidential support, due to the work of Pasteur and others, that the alternative theory of spontaneous generation had been effectively disproven. [[John Desmond Bernal]], a pioneer in [[X-ray crystallography]], suggested that earlier theories such as spontaneous generation were based upon an explanation that life was continuously created as a result of chance events.&lt;ref name="Bernal 1967"&gt;{{harvnb|Bernal|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology ===
{{Main|Biogenesis}}
The term ''biogenesis'' is usually credited to either [[Henry Charlton Bastian]] or to [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].&lt;ref name=eohtBiogenesis&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Hmolpedia |title=Biogenesis |url=http://www.eoht.info/page/Biogenesis |accessdate=2014-05-19 |publisher=WikiFoundry, Inc. |location=Ancaster, Ontario, Canada |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520001148/http://www.eoht.info/page/Biogenesis |archivedate=20 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bastian used the term around 1869 in an unpublished exchange with [[John Tyndall]] to mean "life-origination or commencement". In 1870, Huxley, as new president of the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]], delivered an address entitled ''Biogenesis and Abiogenesis''.&lt;ref name="Huxley 1968"&gt;{{harvnb|Huxley|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he introduced the term ''biogenesis'' (with an opposite meaning to Bastian's) as well as ''abiogenesis'':

:And thus the hypothesis that living matter always arises by the agency of pre-existing living matter, took definite shape; and had, henceforward, a right to be considered and a claim to be refuted, in each particular case, before the production of living matter in any other way could be admitted by careful reasoners. It will be necessary for me to refer to this hypothesis so frequently, that, to save circumlocution, I shall call it the hypothesis of ''Biogenesis''; and I shall term the contrary doctrine–that living matter may be produced by not living matter–the hypothesis of ''Abiogenesis''.&lt;ref name="Huxley 1968" /&gt;

Subsequently, in the preface to Bastian's 1871 book, ''The Modes of Origin of Lowest Organisms'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bastian|1871}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bastian referred to the possible confusion with Huxley's usage and explicitly renounced his own meaning:

:A word of explanation seems necessary with regard to the introduction of the new term ''Archebiosis''. I had originally, in unpublished writings, adopted the word ''Biogenesis'' to express the same meaning—viz., life-origination or commencement. But in the mean time the word ''Biogenesis'' has been made use of, quite independently, by a distinguished biologist [Huxley], who wished to make it bear a totally different meaning. He also introduced the word ''Abiogenesis''. I have been informed, however, on the best authority, that neither of these words can—with any regard to the language from which they are derived—be supposed to bear the meanings which have of late been publicly assigned to them. Wishing to avoid all needless confusion, I therefore renounced the use of the word ''Biogenesis'', and being, for the reason just given, unable to adopt the other term, I was compelled to introduce a new word, in order to designate the process by which living matter is supposed to come into being, independently of pre-existing living matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bastian|1871|p=[https://ia902701.us.archive.org/BookReader/BookReaderImages.php?zip=/23/items/modesoforiginofl00bast/modesoforiginofl00bast_jp2.zip&amp;file=modesoforiginofl00bast_jp2/modesoforiginofl00bast_0015.jp2&amp;scale=4&amp;rotate=0 xi–xii]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Louis Pasteur and Charles Darwin ===
[[File:Darwin restored2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Head and shoulders portrait, increasingly bald with rather uneven bushy white eyebrows and beard, his wrinkled forehead suggesting a puzzled frown|[[Charles Darwin]] in 1879]]
[[Louis Pasteur]] remarked, about a finding of his in 1864 which he considered definitive, "Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow struck by this simple experiment."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oparin|1953|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyndall Fragments2"&gt;{{harvnb|Tyndall|1905|loc=IV, XII (1876), XIII (1878)}}&lt;/ref&gt; One alternative was that life's origins on Earth had come from somewhere else in the universe. Periodically resurrected (see Panspermia, above) Bernal said that this approach "is equivalent in the last resort to asserting the operation of metaphysical, spiritual entities... it turns on the argument of creation by design by a creator or demiurge."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernal|1967|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a theory, Bernal said, was unscientific. A theory popular around the same time was that life was the result of an inner "[[Vitalism|life force]]", which in the late 19th century was championed by [[Henri Bergson]].

The idea of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] proposed by [[Charles Darwin]] put an end to these metaphysical theologies. In a letter to [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] on 1 February 1871,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/darwin/textonly/polar_essay1.jsp |title=Origin and Evolution of Life on a Frozen Earth |last=Priscu |first=John C |authorlink=John Charles Priscu |publisher=[[National Science Foundation]] |location=Arlington County, VA |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218070241/http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/darwin/textonly/polar_essay1.jsp |archivedate=18 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin discussed the suggestion that the original spark of life may have begun in a "warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, {{sic|hide=y|&amp;c.}}, present, that a {{sic|hide=y|[[protein]]e}} compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes." He went on to explain that "at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed." He had written to Hooker in 1863 stating that, "It is mere rubbish, thinking at present of the origin of life; one might as well think of the origin of matter." In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', he had referred to life having been "created", by which he "really meant 'appeared' by some wholly unknown process", but had soon regretted using the Old Testament term "creation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.3&amp;pageseq=30 18]}}: "It is often said that all the conditions for the first production of a living organism are now present, which could ever have been present. But if (and oh! what a big if!) we could conceive in some warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, {{sic|hide=y|&amp;c.}}, present, that a {{sic|hide=y|[[protein]]e}} compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes, at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed." — [[Charles Darwin]], 1 February 1871&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Primordial soup" hypothesis ===
{{anchor | Haldane and Oparin: The Primordial Soup Theory}}&lt;!--This section is linked from [[The Selfish Gene]]--&gt;
{{Main|Primordial soup}}
{{further|Miller–Urey experiment}}
[[File:Aleksandr Oparin and Andrei Kursanov in enzymology laboratory 1938.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alexander Oparin]] (right) in his laboratory, 1938]]
No new notable research or hypothesis on the subject appeared until 1924, when [[Alexander Oparin]] reasoned that atmospheric oxygen prevents the synthesis of certain organic compounds that are necessary building blocks for the evolution of life. In his book ''The Origin of Life'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernal|1967|loc=[http://www.valencia.edu/~orilife/textos/The%20Origin%20of%20Life.pdf ''The Origin of Life'' (A. I. Oparin, 1924), pp. 199–234]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oparin|1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oparin proposed that the "spontaneous generation of life" that had been attacked by Louis Pasteur did in fact occur once, but was now impossible because the conditions found on the early Earth had changed, and preexisting organisms would immediately consume any spontaneously generated organism. Oparin argued that a "primeval soup" of organic molecules could be created in an oxygenless atmosphere through the action of [[sunlight]]. These would combine in ever more complex ways until they formed [[coacervate]] droplets. These droplets would "[[cell growth|grow]]" by fusion with other droplets, and "[[reproduction|reproduce]]" through fission into daughter droplets, and so have a primitive [[metabolism]] in which factors that promote "cell integrity" survive, and those that do not become extinct. Many modern theories of the origin of life still take Oparin's ideas as a starting point.

[[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]] has summarized the "primordial soup" theory of Oparin and [[J. B. S. Haldane]] in its "mature form" as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|1987|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The early Earth had a chemically [[reducing atmosphere]].
# This atmosphere, exposed to [[energy]] in various forms, produced simple organic compounds ("[[monomer]]s").
# These compounds accumulated in a "soup" that may have concentrated at various locations (shorelines, [[Hydrothermal vent|oceanic vents]] etc.).
# By further transformation, more complex organic [[polymer]]s – and ultimately life – developed in the soup.

About this time, Haldane suggested that the Earth's prebiotic oceans (quite different from their modern counterparts) would have formed a "hot dilute soup" in which organic compounds could have formed. Bernal called this idea ''biopoiesis'' or ''biopoesis'', the process of living matter evolving from self-replicating but non-living molecules,&lt;ref name="Bernal 1967" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryson|2004|pp=300–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed that biopoiesis passes through a number of intermediate stages.

One of the most important pieces of experimental support for the "soup" theory came in 1952. [[Stanley Miller|Stanley L. Miller]] and [[Harold Urey|Harold C. Urey]] performed an experiment that demonstrated how organic molecules could have spontaneously formed from inorganic precursors under conditions like those posited by the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis. The now-famous [[Miller–Urey experiment]] used a highly reducing mixture of gases – [[methane]], [[ammonia]], and [[hydrogen gas|hydrogen]], as well as [[water vapor|water vapour]] – to form simple organic monomers such as amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Stanley L. |authorlink=Stanley Miller |date=15 May 1953 |title=A Production of Amino Acids Under Possible Primitive Earth Conditions |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=117 |issue=3046 |pages=528–529 |bibcode=1953Sci...117..528M |doi=10.1126/science.117.3046.528 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=13056598}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of gases was cycled through an apparatus that delivered electrical sparks to the mixture. After one week, it was found that about 10% to 15% of the carbon in the system was then in the form of a [[racemic mixture]] of organic compounds, including amino acids, which are the building blocks of [[protein]]s. This provided direct experimental support for the second point of the "soup" theory, and it is around the remaining two points of the theory that much of the debate now centres.

Bernal showed that based upon this and subsequent work there is no difficulty in principle in forming most of the molecules we recognize as the necessary molecules for life from their inorganic precursors. The underlying hypothesis held by Oparin, Haldane, Bernal, Miller and Urey, for instance, was that multiple conditions on the primeval Earth favoured chemical reactions that synthesized the same set of complex organic compounds from such simple precursors. A 2011 reanalysis of the saved vials containing the original extracts that resulted from the Miller and Urey experiments, using current and more advanced analytical equipment and technology, has uncovered more biochemicals than originally discovered in the 1950s. One of the more important findings was 23 amino acids, far more than the five originally found.&lt;ref name="pmid21422282"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=Eric T. |last2=Cleaves |first2=Henderson J. |last3=Dworkin |first3=Jason P. |last4=Glavin |first4=Daniel P. |last5=Callahan |first5=Michael |last6=Aubrey |first6=Andrew |last7=Lazcano |first7=Antonio |last8=Bada |first8=Jeffrey L. |display-authors=3 |date=5 April 2011 |title=Primordial synthesis of amines and amino acids in a 1958 Miller H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-rich spark discharge experiment |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/14/5526.full.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Proc.

More recent studies, in October 2017, support the notion that life may have begun right after the Earth was formed as RNA molecules emerging from "warm little ponds".&lt;ref name="IND-20171002"&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnston |first=Ian |title=Life first emerged in 'warm little ponds' almost as old as the Earth itself - Charles Darwin's famous idea backed by new scientific study |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/origins-life-ponds-organisms-earth-age-study-a7978906.html |date=2 October 2017 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003003027/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/origins-life-ponds-organisms-earth-age-study-a7978906.html |archivedate=3 October 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proteinoid microspheres ===
{{Main|Proteinoid}}
In trying to uncover the intermediate stages of abiogenesis mentioned by Bernal, [[Sidney W. Fox]] in the 1950s and 1960s studied the spontaneous formation of [[peptide]] structures (small chains of amino acids) under conditions that might plausibly have existed early in Earth's history. In one of his experiments, he allowed amino acids to dry out as if puddled in a warm, dry spot in prebiotic conditions. He found that, as they dried, the amino acids formed long, often cross-linked, thread-like, submicroscopic [[Peptide|polypeptide]] molecules now named "[[Proteinoid|proteinoid microspheres]]".&lt;ref name="foxexp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nitro.biosci.arizona.edu/courses/EEB105/lectures/Origins_of_Life/origins.html |title=Part 4: Experimental studies of the origins of life |last=Walsh |first=J.

In another experiment to set suitable conditions for life to form, Fox collected volcanic material from a [[cinder cone]] in [[Hawaii]]. He discovered that the temperature was over {{convert|100|C}} just {{convert|4|in}} beneath the surface of the cinder cone, and suggested that this might have been the environment in which life was created—molecules could have formed and then been washed through the loose volcanic ash into the sea. He placed lumps of lava over amino acids derived from methane, ammonia and water, sterilized all materials, and baked the lava over the amino acids for a few hours in a glass oven. A brown, sticky substance formed over the surface, and when the lava was drenched in sterilized water, a thick, brown liquid leached out. The amino acids had combined to form [[proteinoid]]s, and the proteinoids had combined to form small globules that Fox called "microspheres". His proteinoids were not cells, although they formed clumps and chains reminiscent of [[cyanobacteria]], but they contained no functional [[nucleic acid]]s or any encoded information. Based upon such experiments, [[Colin Pittendrigh|Colin S. Pittendrigh]] stated in December 1967 that "laboratories will be creating a living cell within ten years," a remark that reflected the typical contemporary naivety about the complexity of cell structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woodward|1969|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=wPNPAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Colin+S.+Pittendrigh%22,+%22laboratories+will+be+creating+a+living+cell+within+ten+years%22&amp;dq=%22Colin+S.+Pittendrigh%22,+%22laboratories+will+be+creating+a+living+cell+within+ten+years%22 287]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current models ==
There is no single, generally accepted model for the origin of life. Scientists have proposed several plausible hypotheses, which share some common elements. While differing in the details, these hypotheses are based on the framework laid out by Alexander Oparin (in 1924) and by J. B. S. Haldane (in 1925), who postulated the molecular or chemical evolution theory of life.&lt;ref name="bah2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bahadur |first=Krishna |year=1973 |title=Photochemical Formation of Self–sustaining Coacervates |url=http://www.dli.gov.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b73_455.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Proceedings of the Indian National Science Academy |volume=39B |issue=4 |pages=455–467 |issn=0370-0046 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019172800/http://www.dli.gov.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b73_455.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df= }}

According to later models, the atmosphere in the late Hadean period consisted largely of nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and carbon dioxide, with smaller amounts of carbon monoxide, hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and sulfur compounds;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasting|1993|p=922}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it did lack molecular oxygen and ozone,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasting|1993|p=920}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was not as chemically reducing as Oparin and Haldane supposed. In the atmosphere proposed by Oparin and Haldane, electrical activity can produce certain small molecules (monomers) of life, such as amino acids. The [[Miller–Urey experiment]] reported in 1953 demonstrated this.

Bernal coined the term ''biopoiesis'' in 1949 to refer to the origin of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernal|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, he suggested that it occurred in three "stages":

# the origin of biological monomers
# the origin of biological polymers
# the evolution from molecules to cells

Bernal suggested that evolution commenced between stages 1 and 2. Bernal regarded the third stage – discovering methods by which biological reactions were incorporated behind a cell's boundary – as the most difficult. Modern work on the way that [[cell membrane]]s self-assemble, and the work on micropores in various substrates may be a halfway house towards the development of independent free-living cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Martin |first= William F. |authorlink= William F.

Estimates of the production of organics from these sources suggest that the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] before 3.5&amp;nbsp;Ga within the early atmosphere made available quantities of organics comparable to those produced by terrestrial sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chyba |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Chyba |last2=Sagan |first2=Carl |authorlink2=Carl Sagan |date=9 January 1992 |title=Endogenous production, exogenous delivery and impact-shock synthesis of organic molecules: an inventory for the origins of life |journal=Nature |volume=355 |issue=6356 |pages=125–132 |bibcode=1992Natur.355..125C |doi=10.1038/355125a0 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=11538392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Furukawa |first1=Yoshihiro |last2=Sekine |first2=Toshimori |last3=Oba |first3=Masahiro |last4=Kakegawa |first4=Takeshi |last5=Nakazawa |first5=Hiromoto |display-authors=3 |date=January 2009 |title=Biomolecule formation by oceanic impacts on early Earth |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=62–66 |bibcode=2009NatGe...2...62F |doi=10.1038/NGEO383 |issn=1752-0894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that the Late Heavy Bombardment may also have effectively sterilized the Earth's surface to a depth of tens of metres. If life evolved deeper than this, it would have also been shielded from the early high levels of ultraviolet radiation from the T Tauri stage of the Sun's evolution. Simulations of geothermically heated oceanic crust yield far more organics than those found in the Miller-Urey experiments (see below). In the deep [[hydrothermal vent]]s, Everett Shock has found "there is an enormous thermodynamic drive to form organic compounds, as [[seawater]] and hydrothermal fluids, which are far from equilibrium, mix and move towards a more stable state."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1999|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shock has found that the available energy is maximized at around 100 – 150 degrees Celsius, precisely the temperatures at which the [[Hyperthermophile|hyperthermophilic]] bacteria and [[Thermoacidophile|thermoacidophilic]] [[archaea]] have been found, at the base of the [[Phylogenetic tree|phylogenetic tree of life]] closest to the [[Last universal ancestor|Last Universal Common Ancestor]] (LUCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bock|Goode|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accumulation and concentration of organic molecules on a planetary surface is also considered an essential early step for the origin of life.&lt;ref name='NASA strategy 2015'/&gt; Identifying and understanding the mechanisms that led to the production of prebiotic
molecules in various environments is critical for establishing the inventory of ingredients from which life originated on Earth, assuming that the abiotic production of molecules ultimately influenced the selection of molecules from which life emerged.&lt;ref name='NASA strategy 2015'/&gt;

=== Chemical synthesis ===
While features of [[self-organization]] and [[self-replication]] are often considered the hallmark of living systems, there are many instances of abiotic molecules exhibiting such characteristics under proper conditions. Stan Palasek suggested based on a theoretical model that self-assembly of [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA) molecules can occur spontaneously due to physical factors in hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Palasek |first=Stan |eprint=1305.5581v1 |title=Primordial RNA Replication and Applications in PCR Technology |class=q-bio.BM |date=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virus]] self-assembly within host cells has implications for the study of the origin of life,&lt;ref name="pmid16984643"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koonin |first1=Eugene V. |authorlink=Eugene Koonin |last2=Senkevich |first2=Tatiana G. |last3=Dolja |first3=Valerian V. |date=19 September 2006 |title=The ancient Virus World and evolution of cells |journal=[[Biology Direct]] |volume=1 |page=29 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-1-29 |issn=1745-6150 |pmc=1594570 |pmid=16984643}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it lends further credence to the hypothesis that life could have started as self-assembling organic molecules.&lt;ref name="pmid16044244"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vlassov |first1=Alexander V. |last2=Kazakov |first2=Sergei A. |last3=Johnston |first3=Brian H. |last4=Landweber |first4=Laura F. |display-authors=3 |date=August 2005 |title=The RNA World on Ice: A New Scenario for the Emergence of RNA Information |journal=[[Journal of Molecular Evolution]] |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=264–273 |doi=10.1007/s00239-004-0362-7 |issn=0022-2844 |pmid=16044244|bibcode=2005JMolE..61..264V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nussinov |first1=Mark D. |last2=Otroshchenko |first2=Vladimir A. |last3=Santoli |first3=Salvatore |year=1997 |title=The emergence of the non-cellular phase of life on the fine-grained clayish particles of the early Earth's regolith |journal=[[BioSystems]] |volume=42 |issue=2–3 |pages=111–118 |doi=10.1016/S0303-2647(96)01699-1 |issn=0303-2647 |pmid=9184757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple sources of energy were available for chemical reactions on the early Earth. For example, heat (such as from [[geothermal energy|geothermal]] processes) is a standard energy source for chemistry. Other examples include sunlight and electrical discharges (lightning), among others.&lt;ref name="Follmann2009" /&gt; Computer simulations also suggest that [[cavitation]] in primordial water reservoirs such as breaking sea waves, streams and oceans can potentially lead to the synthesis of biogenic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00325 Cavitation-Induced Synthesis of Biogenic Molecules on Primordial Earth].

Sci., September 11, 2017, 3 (9), pp 1041–1049. {{doi|10.1021/acscentsci.7b00325}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfavourable reactions can also be driven by highly favourable ones, as in the case of iron-sulfur chemistry. For example, this was probably important for [[carbon fixation]] (the conversion of carbon from its inorganic form to an organic one).&lt;ref group=note&gt;The reactions are:
:FeS + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
:FeS + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HCOOH&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon fixation via iron-sulfur chemistry is highly favourable, and occurs at neutral pH and {{convert|100|C}}. Iron-sulfur surfaces, which are abundant near hydrothermal vents, are also capable of producing small amounts of amino acids and other biological metabolites.&lt;ref name="Follmann2009" /&gt;

As early as the 1860s, experiments have demonstrated that biologically relevant molecules can be produced from interaction of simple carbon sources with abundant inorganic catalysts.  In particular, experiments by [[Alexander Butlerov|Butlerov]] (the [[formose reaction]]) showed that tetroses, pentoses, and hexoses are produced when formaldehyde is heated under basic conditions with divalent metal ions like calcium.  The reaction was scrutinized and subsequently proposed to be autocatalytic by Breslow in 1959.  Similar experiments (see below) demonstrate that nucleobases like guanine and adenine could be synthesized from simple carbon and nitrogen sources like hydrogen cyanide and ammonia.

[[Formamide]] produces all four ribonucleotides and other biological molecules when warmed in the presence of various terrestrial minerals. Formamide is ubiquitous in the Universe, produced by the reaction of water and [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN). It has several advantages as a biotic precursor, including the ability to easily become concentrated through the evaporation of water.&lt;ref name="Saladino2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saladino |first1=Raffaele |last2=Crestini |first2=Claudia |last3=Pino |first3=Samanta |last4=Costanzo |first4=Giovanna |last5=Di Mauro |first5=Ernesto |display-authors=3 |date=March 2012 |title=Formamide and the origin of life. |journal=[[Physics of Life Reviews]] |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=84–104 |bibcode=2012PhLRv...9...84S |doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2011.12.002 |issn=1571-0645 |pmid=22196896|hdl=2108/85168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saladino2012b"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saladino |first1=Raffaele |last2=Botta |first2=Giorgia |last3=Pino |first3=Samanta |last4=Costanzo |first4=Giovanna |last5=Di Mauro |first5=Ernesto |display-authors=3 |date=July 2012 |title=From the one-carbon amide formamide to RNA all the steps are prebiotically possible |journal=[[Biochimie]] |volume=94 |issue=7 |pages=1451–1456 |doi=10.1016/j.biochi.2012.02.018 |issn=0300-9084 |pmid=22738728}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although HCN is poisonous, it only affects [[aerobic organism]]s ([[eukaryote]]s and aerobic bacteria), which did not yet exist.

=== Autocatalysis ===
{{Main|Autocatalysis}}
[[Autocatalysis|Autocatalysts]] are substances that catalyze the production of themselves and therefore are "molecular replicators." The simplest self-replicating chemical systems are autocatalytic, and typically contain three components: a product molecule and two precursor molecules. The product molecule joins together the precursor molecules, which in turn produce more product molecules from more precursor molecules. The product molecule catalyzes the reaction by providing a complementary template that binds to the precursors, thus bringing them together. Such systems have been demonstrated both in biological [[macromolecule]]s and in small organic molecules.&lt;ref name="Paul2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paul |first1=Natasha |last2=Joyce |first2=Gerald F. |date=December 2004 |title=Minimal self-replicating systems |journal=Current Opinion in Chemical Biology |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=634–639 |doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2004.09.005 |issn=1367-5931 |pmid=15556408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bissette2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bissette |first1=Andrew J. |last2=Fletcher |first2=Stephen P. |date=2 December 2013 |title=Mechanisms of Autocatalysis |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |volume=52 |issue=49 |pages=12800–12826 |doi=10.1002/anie.201303822 |issn=1433-7851 |pmid=24127341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems that do not proceed by template mechanisms, such as the self-reproduction of [[micelle]]s and [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]], have also been observed.&lt;ref name="Bissette2013" /&gt;

In the early 1970s, Manfred Eigen and [[Peter Schuster]] examined the transient stages between the molecular chaos and a self-replicating [[Hypercycle (chemistry)|hypercycle]] in a prebiotic soup.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eigen|Schuster|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a hypercycle, the [[information]] storing system (possibly RNA) produces an [[enzyme]], which catalyzes the formation of another information system, in sequence until the product of the last aids in the formation of the first information system. Mathematically treated, hypercycles could create [[Quasispecies model|quasispecies]], which through natural selection entered into a form of Darwinian evolution. A boost to hypercycle theory was the discovery of [[ribozyme]]s capable of catalyzing their own chemical reactions. The hypercycle theory requires the existence of complex biochemicals, such as nucleotides, which do not form under the conditions proposed by the Miller–Urey experiment.

[[Geoffrey W. Hoffmann]] has shown that an early error-prone translation machinery can be stable against an error catastrophe of the type that had been envisaged as problematical for the origin of life, and was known as "Orgel's paradox".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoffmann |first=Geoffrey W. |authorlink=Geoffrey W.

Hoffmann has furthermore argued that a complex nucleation event as the origin of life involving both polypeptides and nucleic acid is compatible with the time and space available in the primitive oceans of Earth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite biorxiv|last1=Hoffmann|first1=Geoffrey William|title=A network theory of the origin of life|date=24 December 2016|biorxiv=096701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffmann suggests that volcanic ash may provide the many random shapes needed in the postulated complex nucleation event. This aspect of the theory can be tested experimentally.

=== Homochirality ===
{{Main|Homochirality}}
Homochirality refers to a geometric uniformity of some materials composed of [[chirality|chiral]] units. Chiral refers to nonsuperimposable 3D forms that are mirror images of one another, as are left and right hands. Living organisms use molecules that have the same chirality ("handedness"): with almost no exceptions,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaichian|Rojas|Tureanu|2014|pp=353–364}}&lt;/ref&gt; amino acids are left-handed while nucleotides and [[Carbohydrate|sugars]] are right-handed. Chiral molecules can be synthesized, but in the absence of a chiral source or a chiral [[Catalysis|catalyst]], they are formed in a 50/50 mixture of both [[enantiomer]]s (called a racemic mixture). Known mechanisms for the production of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the [[electroweak interaction]]; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] light, [[Quartz|quartz crystals]], or the Earth's rotation, [[statistical fluctuations]] during racemic synthesis,&lt;ref name="Plasson2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plasson |first1=Raphaël |last2=Kondepudi |first2=Dilip K. |last3=Bersini |first3=Hugues |last4=Commeyras |first4=Auguste |last5=Asakura |first5=Kouichi |display-authors=3 |date=August 2007 |title=Emergence of homochirality in far-from-equilibrium systems: Mechanisms and role in prebiotic chemistry |journal=[[Chirality (journal)|Chirality]] |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=589–600 |doi=10.1002/chir.20440 |issn=0899-0042 |pmid=17559107}} "Special Issue: Proceedings from the Eighteenth International Symposium on Chirality (ISCD-18), Busan, Korea, 2006"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]].&lt;ref name="jafarpour2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2017 |title=Noise-induced symmetry breaking far from equilibrium and the emergence of biological homochirality |journal=Physical Review E |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=032407 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.95.032407|pmid=28415353 |bibcode=2017PhRvE..95c2407J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jafarpour2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2015 |title=Noise-induced mechanism for biological homochirality of early life self-replicators |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=115 |issue=15 |pages=158101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.158101|pmid=26550754 |arxiv=1507.00044 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115o8101J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frank1953"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=F.C. |year=1953 |title=On spontaneous asymmetric synthesis |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=11 |pages=459–463 |doi=10.1016/0006-3002(53)90082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-assembled [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]] are essential components of primitive cells.&lt;ref name="Chen 2010" /&gt; The [[second law of thermodynamics]] requires that the universe move in a direction in which [[entropy]] increases, yet life is distinguished by its great degree of organization.

Chen and Jack W.

Such cooperative interactions between the membrane and its encapsulated contents could greatly simplify the transition from simple replicating molecules to true cells.&lt;ref name="Chen 2006" /&gt; Furthermore, competition for membrane molecules would favour stabilized membranes, suggesting a selective advantage for the evolution of cross-linked fatty acids and even the [[phospholipid]]s of today.&lt;ref name="Chen 2006" /&gt; Such [[micro-encapsulation]] would allow for metabolism within the membrane, the exchange of small molecules but the prevention of passage of large substances across it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chang|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantages of encapsulation include the increased [[solubility]] of the contained cargo within the capsule and the storage of energy in the form of a [[electrochemical gradient]].

Possible precursors for the evolution of protein synthesis include a mechanism to synthesize short peptide cofactors or form a mechanism for the duplication of RNA. It is likely that the ancestral ribosome was composed entirely of RNA, although some roles have since been taken over by proteins. Major remaining questions on this topic include identifying the selective force for the evolution of the ribosome and determining how the [[genetic code]] arose.&lt;ref name="Noller2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Noller |first=Harry F. |authorlink=Harry F.

[[Eugene Koonin]] said, "Despite considerable experimental and theoretical effort, no compelling scenarios currently exist for the origin of replication and translation, the key processes that together comprise the core of biological systems and the apparent pre-requisite of biological evolution. The RNA World concept might offer the best chance for the resolution of this conundrum but so far cannot adequately account for the emergence of an efficient RNA replicase or the translation system. The MWO ["many worlds in one"] version of the cosmological model of [[eternal inflation]] could suggest a way out of this conundrum because, in an infinite [[multiverse]] with a finite number of distinct macroscopic histories (each repeated an infinite number of times), emergence of even highly complex systems by chance is not just possible but inevitable."&lt;ref name="pmc1892545"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koonin |first=Eugene V. |date=31 May 2007 |title=The cosmological model of eternal inflation and the transition from chance to biological evolution in the history of life |journal=Biology Direct |volume=2 |page=15 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-2-15 |issn=1745-6150 |pmc=1892545 |pmid=17540027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RNA synthesis and replication ===
A number of hypotheses of formation of RNA have been put forward. {{As of|1994}}, there were difficulties in the explanation of the abiotic synthesis of the nucleotides cytosine and uracil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orgel |first=Leslie E. |date=October 1994 |title=The origin of life on Earth|journal=Scientific American |volume=271 |issue=4 |pages=76–83 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1094-76 |issn=0036-8733 |pmid=7524147|bibcode=1994SciAm.271d..76O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research has shown possible routes of synthesis; for example, formamide produces all four ribonucleotides and other biological molecules when warmed in the presence of various terrestrial minerals.&lt;ref name="Saladino2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saladino2012b" /&gt; Early cell membranes could have formed spontaneously from proteinoids, which are protein-like molecules produced when amino acid solutions are heated while in the correct concentration of aqueous solution. These are seen to form micro-spheres which are observed to behave similarly to membrane-enclosed compartments. Other possible means of producing more complicated organic molecules include chemical reactions that take place on [[clay]] substrates or on the surface of the mineral [[pyrite]].

Factors supporting an important role for RNA in early life include its ability to act both to store information and to catalyze chemical reactions (as a ribozyme); its many important roles as an intermediate in the expression of and maintenance of the genetic information (in the form of DNA) in modern organisms; and the ease of chemical synthesis of at least the components of the RNA molecule under the conditions that approximated the early Earth. Relatively short RNA molecules have been synthesized, capable of replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnston |first1=Wendy K. |last2=Unrau |first2=Peter J. |last3=Lawrence |first3=Michael S. |last4=Glasner |first4=Margaret E. |last5=Bartel |first5=David P. |authorlink5=David Bartel |display-authors=3 |date=18 May 2001 |title=RNA-Catalyzed RNA Polymerization: Accurate and General RNA-Templated Primer Extension |journal=Science |volume=292 |issue=5520 |pages=1319–1325 |bibcode=2001Sci...292.1319J |doi=10.1126/science.1060786 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=11358999|citeseerx=10.1.1.70.5439 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such replicase RNA, which functions as both code and catalyst provides its own template upon which copying can occur.

Depending on the definition, life started when RNA chains began to self-replicate, initiating the three mechanisms of Darwinian selection: [[heritability]], variation of type, and differential reproductive output. The fitness of an RNA replicator (its per capita rate of increase) would likely be a function of its intrinsic adaptive capacities, determined by its nucleotide sequence, and the availability of resources.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Harris |last2=Byerly |first2=Henry C. |last3=Hopf |first3=Frederick A. |last4=Michod |first4=Richard A. |last5=Vemulapalli |first5=G.

Pyrimidine ribonucleosides and their respective nucleotides have been prebiotically synthesized by a sequence of reactions which by-pass the free sugars, and are assembled in a stepwise fashion by using nitrogenous or oxygenous chemistries.

One of the earliest incarnations of this idea was put forward in 1924 with Oparin's notion of primitive self-replicating vesicles which predated the discovery of the structure of DNA. Variants in the 1980s and 1990s include Wächtershäuser's iron–sulfur world theory and models introduced by [[Christian de Duve]] based on the chemistry of [[thioester]]s. More abstract and theoretical arguments for the plausibility of the emergence of metabolism without the presence of genes include a mathematical model introduced by [[Freeman Dyson]] in the early 1980s and [[Stuart Kauffman]]'s notion of collectively autocatalytic sets, discussed later that decade.

Orgel summarized his analysis by stating, "There is at present no reason to expect that multistep cycles such as the reductive citric acid cycle will self-organize on the surface of FeS/FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or some other mineral."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orgel |first=Leslie E. |date=7 November 2000 |title=Self-organizing biochemical cycles |journal=Proc.

For example, instead of the reductive citric acid cycle, the "open" [[acetyl-CoA]] pathway (another one of the five recognized ways of carbon dioxide fixation in nature today) would be compatible with the idea of self-organization on a metal sulfide surface. The key enzyme of this pathway, [[carbon monoxide dehydrogenase]]/[[CO-methylating acetyl-CoA synthase|acetyl-CoA synthase]], harbours mixed nickel-iron-sulfur clusters in its reaction centres and catalyzes the formation of acetyl-CoA (similar to acetyl-thiol) in a single step.

Oceanic vent systems and other hydrothermal systems have a zonal structure reflected in ancient [[Volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit|volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits]] (VMS) of hydrothermal origin. They reach many kilometres in diameter and date back to the [[Archean]] Eon. Most abundant are pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[chalcopyrite]] (CuFeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[sphalerite]] (ZnS), with additions of [[galena]] (PbS) and [[alabandite]] (MnS). ZnS and MnS have a unique ability to store radiation energy, e.g. from UV light. During the relevant time window of the origins of replicating molecules, the primordial atmospheric pressure was high enough (&gt;100&amp;nbsp;bar, about 100 atmospheres) to precipitate near the Earth's surface, and UV irradiation was 10 to 100 times more intense than now; hence the unique photosynthetic properties mediated by ZnS provided just the right energy conditions to energize the synthesis of informational and metabolic molecules and the selection of photostable nucleobases.

The Zn-world theory has been further filled out with experimental and theoretical evidence for the ionic constitution of the interior of the first proto-cells before archaea, bacteria and [[Origin of eukaryotes|proto-eukaryotes]] evolved. [[Archibald Macallum]] noted the resemblance of body fluids such as blood and lymph to seawater;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Macallum |first=A.

The authors conclude that ubiquitous, and by inference primordial, proteins and functional systems show affinity to and functional requirement for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and phosphate. Geochemical reconstruction shows that the ionic composition conducive to the origin of cells could not have existed in what we today call marine settings but is compatible with emissions of vapour-dominated zones of what we today call inland geothermal systems. Under the oxygen depleted, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-dominated primordial atmosphere, the chemistry of water condensates and exhalations near geothermal fields would resemble the internal milieu of modern cells. Therefore, the precellular stages of evolution may have taken place in shallow "Darwin ponds" lined with porous [[silicate minerals]] mixed with metal sulfides and enriched in K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and phosphorus compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mulkidjanian |first1=Armen Y. |last2=Bychkov |first2=Andrew Yu. |last3=Dibrova |first3=Daria V. |last4=Galperin |first4=Michael Y. |last5=Koonin |first5=Eugene V. |display-authors=3 |date=3 April 2012 |title=Origin of first cells at terrestrial, anoxic geothermal fields |journal=Proc.

The vents form a sustained chemical energy source derived from redox reactions, in which electron donors (molecular hydrogen) react with electron acceptors (carbon dioxide); see [[Iron–sulfur world theory]]. These are highly [[exothermic reaction]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The reactions are:&lt;br /&gt;
'''Reaction 1''': Fayalite + water → magnetite + aqueous silica + hydrogen''
:3Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
'''Reaction 2''': ''Forsterite + aqueous silica → serpentine''
:3Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
'''Reaction 3''': ''Forsterite + water → serpentine + brucite''
:2Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Reaction 3 describes the hydration of olivine with water only to yield [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] and Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[brucite]]). Serpentine is stable at high pH in the presence of brucite like calcium silicate hydrate, ([[calcium silicate hydrate|C-S-H]]) phases formed along with [[portlandite]] (Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in hardened [[Portland cement]] paste after the hydration of [[belite]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), the artificial calcium equivalent of forsterite.

Analogy of reaction 3 with belite hydration in ordinary Portland cement: ''Belite + water → C-S-H phase + portlandite''
:2 Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 3 CaO · 2 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; · 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Russell demonstrated that alkaline vents created an abiogenic [[Proton electromotive force|proton motive force]] (PMF) [[Chemiosmosis|chemiosmotic]] gradient,&lt;ref name="Martin2003" /&gt; in which conditions are ideal for an abiogenic hatchery for life. Their microscopic compartments "provide a natural means of concentrating organic molecules," composed of iron-sulfur minerals such as [[mackinawite]], endowed these mineral cells with the catalytic properties envisaged by Wächtershäuser.&lt;ref name="Lane 2009" /&gt; This movement of ions across the membrane depends on a combination of two factors:
# [[Diffusion]] force caused by concentration gradient—all particles including ions tend to diffuse from higher concentration to lower.
# Electrostatic force caused by electrical potential gradient—[[cations]] like [[proton]]s H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; tend to diffuse down the electrical potential, [[anions]] in the opposite direction.
These two gradients taken together can be expressed as an [[electrochemical gradient]], providing energy for abiogenic synthesis. The proton motive force can be described as the measure of the potential energy stored as a combination of proton and voltage gradients across a membrane (differences in proton concentration and electrical potential).

Jack W. Szostak suggested that geothermal activity provides greater opportunities for the origination of life in open lakes where there is a buildup of minerals. In 2010, based on spectral analysis of sea and hot mineral water, Ignat Ignatov and Oleg Mosin demonstrated that life may have predominantly originated in hot mineral water. The hot mineral water that contains [[bicarbonate]] and [[calcium]] ions has the most optimal range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ignatov |first=Ignat |last2=Mosin |first2=Oleg V. |year=2013 |title=Possible Processes for Origin of Life and Living Matter with modeling of Physiological Processes of Bacterium ''Bacillus Subtilis'' in Heavy Water as Model System |journal=Journal of Natural Sciences Research |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=65–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case is similar to the origin of life in hydrothermal vents, but with bicarbonate and calcium ions in hot water. This water has a pH of 9–11 and is possible to have the reactions in seawater. According to [[Melvin Calvin]], certain reactions of condensation-dehydration of amino acids and nucleotides in individual blocks of peptides and nucleic acids can take place in the primary hydrosphere with pH 9-11 at a later evolutionary stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Calvin|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these compounds like [[Hydrogen cyanide|hydrocyanic acid]] (HCN) have been proven in the experiments of Miller. This is the environment in which the [[stromatolite]]s have been created.

Experimental research and computer modelling suggest that the surfaces of mineral particles inside hydrothermal vents have catalytic properties similar to those of enzymes and are able to create simple organic molecules, such as [[methanol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH) and [[Formic acid|formic]], [[Acetic acid|acetic]] and [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvic]] acid out of the dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the water.&lt;ref name="organics"&gt;{{cite press release |last=Usher |first=Oli |date=27 April 2015 |title=Chemistry of seabed's hot vents could explain emergence of life |url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/silva/mathematical-physical-sciences/maps-news-publication/maps1526 |publisher=[[University College London]] |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roldan |first1=Alberto |last2=Hollingsworth |first2=Nathan |last3=Roffey |first3=Anna |last4=Islam |first4=Husn-Ubayda |last5=Goodall |first5=Josephine B.

=== Thermosynthesis ===
Today's bioenergetic process of [[fermentation]] is carried out by either the aforementioned citric acid cycle or the Acetyl-CoA pathway, both of which have been connected to the primordial Iron–sulfur world. In a different approach, the thermosynthesis hypothesis considers the bioenergetic process of [[chemiosmosis]], which plays an essential role in [[cellular respiration]] and photosynthesis, more basal than fermentation: the [[ATP synthase]] enzyme, which sustains chemiosmosis, is proposed as the currently extant enzyme most closely related to the first metabolic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Anthonie W. J. |date=7 August 1985 |pages=429–453 |title=Thermosynthesis by biomembranes: Energy gain from cyclic temperature changes |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=115 |issue=3 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(85)80202-2 |issn=0022-5193 |pmid=3162066}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Anthonie W.

First, life needed an energy source to bring about the condensation reaction that yielded the peptide bonds of proteins and the [[phosphodiester bond]]s of RNA. In a generalization and thermal variation of the [[ATP synthase#Binding-change model|binding change mechanism]] of today's ATP synthase, the "first protein" would have bound substrates (peptides, phosphate, nucleosides, RNA 'monomers') and condensed them to a reaction product that remained bound until after a temperature change it was released by thermal unfolding.

The energy source under the thermosynthesis hypothesis was thermal cycling, the result of suspension of protocells in a [[convection]] current, as is plausible in a volcanic hot spring; the convection accounts for the self-organization and [[Dissipative system|dissipative structure]] required in any origin of life model. The still ubiquitous role of thermal cycling in germination and cell division is considered a relic of primordial thermosynthesis.

By [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylating]] cell membrane lipids, this "first protein" gave a selective advantage to the lipid protocell that contained the protein. This protein also synthesized a library of many proteins, of which only a minute fraction had thermosynthesis capabilities. As proposed by Dyson,&lt;ref name="Dyson 1999" /&gt; it propagated functionally: it made daughters with similar capabilities, but it did not copy itself. Functioning daughters consisted of different amino acid sequences.

Whereas the Iron–sulfur world identifies a circular pathway as the most simple, the thermosynthesis hypothesis does not even invoke a pathway: [[ATP synthase#Binding-change model|ATP synthase's binding change mechanism]] resembles a physical adsorption process that yields free energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Muller |first1=Anthonie W.

It has been claimed that the emergence of cyclic systems of protein catalysts is implausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Orgel|1987|pp=9–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clay hypothesis ===
[[Montmorillonite]], an abundant [[clay]], is a catalyst for the polymerization of RNA and for the formation of membranes from lipids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Perry |first=Caroline |date=7 February 2011 |title=Clay-armored bubbles may have formed first protocells |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-02/hu-cbm020411.php |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Harvard University]] |agency=EurekAlert! |accessdate=2015-06-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714101638/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-02/hu-cbm020411.php |archivedate=14 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A model for the origin of life using clay was forwarded by [[Graham Cairns-Smith|Alexander Graham Cairns-Smith]] in 1985 and explored as a plausible mechanism by several scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawkins|1996|pp=148–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clay hypothesis postulates that complex organic molecules arose gradually on pre-existing, non-organic replication surfaces of silicate crystals in solution.

At the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], James P. Ferris' studies have also confirmed that clay minerals of [[montmorillonite]] catalyze the formation of RNA in aqueous solution, by joining nucleotides to form longer chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wenhua Huang |last2=Ferris |first2=James P. |date=12 July 2006 |title=One-Step, Regioselective Synthesis of up to 50-mers of RNA Oligomers by Montmorillonite Catalysis |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=128 |issue=27 |pages=8914–8919 |doi=10.1021/ja061782k |issn=0002-7863 |pmid=16819887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Bart Kahr from the [[University of Washington]] and colleagues reported their experiments that tested the idea that crystals can act as a source of transferable information, using crystals of [[potassium hydrogen phthalate]]. "Mother" crystals with imperfections were cleaved and used as seeds to grow "daughter" crystals from solution. They then examined the distribution of imperfections in the new crystals and found that the imperfections in the mother crystals were reproduced in the daughters, but the daughter crystals also had many additional imperfections. For gene-like behaviour to be observed, the quantity of inheritance of these imperfections should have exceeded that of the mutations in the successive generations, but it did not. Thus Kahr concluded that the crystals "were not faithful enough to store and transfer information from one generation to the next."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moore |first=Caroline |date=16 July 2007 |title=Crystals as genes? |url=http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2007/08/Crystals_as_genes.asp |journal=Highlights in Chemical Science |issn=2041-5818 |accessdate=2015-06-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714094855/http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2007/08/Crystals_as_genes.asp |archivedate=14 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}

=== Gold's "deep-hot biosphere" model ===
In the 1970s, [[Thomas Gold]] proposed the theory that life first developed not on the surface of the Earth, but several kilometres below the surface. It is claimed that discovery of microbial life below the surface of another body in our Solar System would lend significant credence to this theory. Thomas Gold also asserted that a trickle of food from a deep, unreachable, source is needed for survival because life arising in a puddle of organic material is likely to consume all of its food and become extinct. Gold's theory is that the flow of such food is due to out-gassing of primordial methane from the Earth's mantle; more conventional explanations of the food supply of deep microbes (away from sedimentary carbon compounds) is that the organisms [[Microbial metabolism#Hydrogen oxidation|subsist on hydrogen]] released by an interaction between water and (reduced) iron compounds in rocks.

The panspermia hypothesis does not attempt to explain how life first originated, but merely shifts it to another planet or a comet. The advantage of an extraterrestrial origin of primitive life is that life is not required to have formed on each planet it occurs on, but rather in a single location, and then spread about the [[galaxy]] to other star systems via cometary and/or meteorite impact.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160912"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Visions of Life on Mars in Earth’s Depths |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |date=12 September 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=12 September 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912225220/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |archivedate=12 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence to support the hypothesis is scant, but it finds support in studies of [[Martian meteorite]]s found in [[Antarctica]] and in studies of [[extremophile]] microbes' survival in outer space tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=Stuart |date=25 September 2002 |title=Tough Earth bug may be from Mars |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2844 |journal=New Scientist |issn=0262-4079 |accessdate=2015-06-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202003401/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2844 |archivedate=2 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerda Horneck"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Horneck |first1=Gerda |last2=Klaus |first2=David M. |last3=Mancinelli |first3=Rocco L. |date=March 2010 |title=Space Microbiology |journal=[[Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews]] |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=121–156 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.00016-09 |issn=1092-2172 |pmc=2832349 |pmid=20197502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rabbow"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rabbow |first1=Elke |last2=Horneck |first2=Gerda |last3=Rettberg |first3=Petra |last4=Schott |first4=Jobst-Ulrich |last5=Panitz |first5=Corinna |last6=L'Afflitto |first6=Andrea |last7=von Heise-Rotenburg |first7=Ralf |last8=Willnecker |first8=Reiner |last9=Baglioni |first9=Pietro |last10=Hatton |first10=Jason |last11=Dettmann |first11=Jan |last12=Demets |first12=René |last13=Reitz |first13=Günther |display-authors=3 |date=December 2009 |title=EXPOSE, an Astrobiological Exposure Facility on the International Space Station – from Proposal to Flight |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=581–598 |bibcode=2009OLEB...39..581R |doi=10.1007/s11084-009-9173-6 |issn=0169-6149 |pmid=19629743}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Onofri |first1=Silvano |last2=de la Torre |first2=Rosa |last3=de Vera |first3=Jean-Pierre |last4=Ott |first4=Sieglinde |last5=Zucconi |first5=Laura |last6=Selbmann |first6=Laura |last7=Scalzi |first7=Giuliano |last8=Venkateswaran |first8=Kasthuri J. |last9=Rabbow |first9=Elke |last10=Sánchez Iñigo |first10=Francisco J. |last11=Horneck |first11=Gerda |display-authors=3 |date=May 2012 |title=Survival of Rock-Colonizing Organisms After 1.5 Years in Outer Space |journal=Astrobiology |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=508–516 |bibcode=2012AsBio..12..508O |doi=10.1089/ast.2011.0736 |issn=1531-1074 |pmid=22680696}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also: [[List of microorganisms tested in outer space]].)

These molecules were not present on early Earth, but other [[Amphiphile|amphiphilic]] long-chain molecules also form membranes. Furthermore, these bodies may expand (by insertion of additional lipids), and under excessive expansion may undergo spontaneous splitting which preserves the same size and composition of lipids in the two [[Offspring|progenies]]. The main idea in this theory is that the molecular composition of the lipid bodies is the preliminary way for information storage, and evolution led to the appearance of polymer entities such as RNA or DNA that may store information favourably. Studies on vesicles from potentially prebiotic amphiphiles have so far been limited to systems containing one or two types of amphiphiles. This in contrast to the output of simulated prebiotic chemical reactions, which typically produce very heterogeneous mixtures of compounds.&lt;ref name="Chen 2010" /&gt;
Within the hypothesis of a lipid bilayer membrane composed of a mixture of various distinct amphiphilic compounds there is the opportunity of a huge number of theoretically possible combinations in the arrangements of these amphiphiles in the membrane. Among all these potential combinations, a specific local arrangement of the membrane would have favoured the constitution of a hypercycle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eigen |first1=Manfred |authorlink1=Manfred Eigen |last2=Schuster |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Schuster |date=November 1977 |title=The Hypercycle.

=== Polyphosphates ===
A problem in most scenarios of abiogenesis is that the thermodynamic equilibrium of amino acid versus peptides is in the direction of separate amino acids. What has been missing is some force that drives polymerization. The resolution of this problem may well be in the properties of [[polyphosphate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Michael R.

Several mechanisms of organic molecule synthesis have been investigated. Polyphosphates cause polymerization of amino acids into peptides. They are also logical precursors in the synthesis of such key biochemical compounds as [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP). A key issue seems to be that calcium reacts with soluble phosphate to form insoluble [[calcium phosphate]] ([[apatite]]), so some plausible mechanism must be found to keep calcium ions from causing precipitation of phosphate. There has been much work on this topic over the years, but an interesting new idea is that meteorites may have introduced reactive phosphorus species on the early Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pasek |first=Matthew A. |date=22 January 2008 |title=Rethinking early Earth phosphorus geochemistry |journal=Proc.

=== Radioactive beach hypothesis ===
Zachary Adam claims that tidal processes that occurred during a time when the Moon was much closer may have concentrated grains of [[uranium]] and other radioactive elements at the high-water mark on primordial beaches, where they may have been responsible for generating life's building blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dartnell |first=Lewis |date=12 January 2008 |title=Did life begin on a radioactive beach? |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726384.000-did-life-begin-on-a-radioactive-beach.html |journal=New Scientist |issue=2638 |page=8 |issn=0262-4079 |accessdate=2015-06-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627101858/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726384.000-did-life-begin-on-a-radioactive-beach.html |archivedate=27 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to computer models,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adam |first=Zachary |year=2007 |title=Actinides and Life's Origins |journal=Astrobiology |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=852–872 |bibcode=2007AsBio...7..852A |doi=10.1089/ast.2006.0066 |issn=1531-1074 |pmid=18163867}}&lt;/ref&gt; a deposit of such radioactive materials could show the same [[Natural nuclear fission reactor|self-sustaining nuclear reaction]] as that found in the [[Oklo]] uranium ore seam in [[Gabon]]. Such radioactive beach sand might have provided sufficient energy to generate organic molecules, such as amino acids and sugars from [[acetonitrile]] in water. Radioactive [[monazite]] material also has released soluble phosphate into the regions between sand-grains, making it biologically "accessible." Thus amino acids, sugars, and soluble phosphates might have been produced simultaneously, according to Adam. Radioactive [[actinide]]s, left behind in some concentration by the reaction, might have formed part of [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallic complexes]]. These complexes could have been important early catalysts to living processes.

John Parnell has suggested that such a process could provide part of the "crucible of life" in the early stages of any early wet rocky planet, so long as the planet is large enough to have generated a system of plate tectonics which brings radioactive minerals to the surface. As the early Earth is thought to have had many smaller plates, it might have provided a suitable environment for such processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parnell |first=John |date=December 2004 |title=Mineral Radioactivity in Sands as a Mechanism for Fixation of Organic Carbon on the Early Earth |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=533–547 |bibcode=2004OLEB...34..533P |doi=10.1023/B:ORIG.0000043132.23966.a1 |issn=0169-6149 |pmid=15570707|citeseerx=10.1.1.456.8955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermodynamic dissipation ===
The 19th-century Austrian physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] first recognized that the struggle for existence of living organisms was neither over raw material nor [[energy]], but instead had to do with [[entropy production]] derived from the conversion of the solar [[spectrum]] into [[heat]] by these systems.&lt;ref&gt;Boltzmann, L. (1886) The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in: Ludwig Boltzmann: Theoretical physics and Selected writings, edited by: McGinness, B., D. Reidel, Dordrecht, The Netherlands, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Boltzmann thus realized that living systems, like all [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|irreversible processes]], were dependent on the [[dissipation]] of a generalized chemical potential for their existence. In his book "What is Life", the 20th-century Austrian physicist [[Erwin Schrödinger]]&lt;ref&gt;Schrödinger, Erwin (1944) What is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized the importance of Boltzmann’s deep insight into the irreversible thermodynamic nature of living systems, suggesting that this was the physics and chemistry behind the origin and evolution of life. However, irreversible processes, and much less living systems, could not be conveniently analyzed under this perspective until [[Lars Onsager]],&lt;ref&gt;Onsager, L. (1931) Reciprocal Relations in Irreversible Processes I and II, ''Phys. Rev.'' 37, 405; 38, 2265 (1931)&lt;/ref&gt; and later Ilya [[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine]],&lt;ref&gt;Prigogine, I. (1967) An Introduction to the Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes, Wiley, New York&lt;/ref&gt; developed an elegant mathematical formalism for treating the "self-organization" of material under a generalized chemical potential. This formalism became known as Classical Irreversible Thermodynamics and Prigogine was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1977 "for his contributions to [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]], particularly the theory of [[Dissipative system|dissipative structures]]". The analysis of Prigogine showed that if a [[system]] were left to evolve under an imposed external potential, material could spontaneously organize (lower its [[entropy]]) forming what he called "dissipative structures" which would increase the dissipation of the externally imposed potential (augment the global entropy production). Non-equilibrium thermodynamics has since been successfully applied to the analysis of living systems, from the biochemical production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dewar | first1 = R | last2 = Juretić | first2 = D. | last3 = Županović | first3 = P. | year = 2006 | title = The functional design of the rotary enzyme ATP synthase is consistent with maximum entropy production | url = | journal = Chem.

Michaelian has shown using the formalism of non-linear irreversible thermodynamics that there would have existed during the [[Archean]] a thermodynamic imperative to the abiogenic UV-C [[Photochemistry|photochemical]] synthesis and proliferation of these pigments over the entire Earth surface if they acted as [[Catalysis|catalysts]] to augment the dissipation of the solar photons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/475/1/012010 |title=A non-linear irreversible thermodynamic perspective on organic pigment proliferation and biological evolution |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |volume=475 |issue=1 |pages=012010 |year=2013 |last1=Michaelian |first1=K |bibcode=2013JPhCS.475a2010M |arxiv=1307.5924 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the Archean, with life-induced [[ozone]] dissipating UV-C light in the Earth’s upper atmosphere, it would have become ever more improbable for a completely new life to emerge that didn’t rely on the complex metabolic pathways already existing since now the free energy in the photons arriving at Earth’s surface would have been insufficient for direct breaking and remaking of [[covalent bond]]s. It has been suggested, however, that such changes in the surface flux of ultraviolet radiation due to geophysical events affecting the atmosphere could have been what promoted the development of complexity in life based on existing metabolic pathways, for example during the [[Cambrian explosion]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Doglioni | first1 = C. | last2 = Pignatti | first2 = J. | last3 = Coleman | first3 = M. | year = 2016 | title = Why did life develop on the surface of the Earth in the Cambrian? | url = | journal = Geoscience Frontiers | volume = 7 | issue = 6| pages = 865–873 | doi=10.1016/j.gsf.2016.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many salient characteristics of the fundamental molecules of life (those found in all three domains) all point directly to the involvement of UV-C light in the dissipative structuring of incipient life.&lt;ref name="Michaelian, K. 2016"/&gt; Some of the most difficult problems concerning the origin of life, such as enzyme-less [[DNA replication|replication]] of RNA and DNA, [[homochirality]] of the fundamental molecules, and the origin of [[Genetic code|information encoding]] in RNA and DNA, also find an explanation within the same dissipative thermodynamic framework by considering the probable existence of a relation between primordial replication and UV-C photon dissipation. Michaelian suggests that it is erroneous to expect to describe the emergence, proliferation, or even evolution, of life without overwhelming reference to entropy production through the dissipation of a generalized chemical potential, in particular, the prevailing solar photon flux.

=== Multiple genesis ===
Different forms of life with variable origin processes may have appeared quasi-simultaneously in the early [[history of Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davies |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Davies |date=December 2007 |title=Are Aliens Among Us? |url=http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/kalthoff/bio301c/readings/07Davies.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Scientific American |volume=297 |issue=6 |pages=62–69 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1207-62 |issn=0036-8733 |accessdate=2015-07-16 |quote=...if life does emerge readily under terrestrial conditions, then perhaps it formed many times on our home planet. To pursue this possibility, deserts, lakes and other extreme or isolated environments have been searched for evidence of "alien" life-forms—organisms that would differ fundamentally from known organisms because they arose independently. |bibcode=2007SciAm.297f..62D |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185832/http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/kalthoff/bio301c/readings/07Davies.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other forms may be extinct (having left distinctive fossils through their different biochemistry—e.g., [[hypothetical types of biochemistry]]). It has been proposed that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first organisms were self-replicating iron-rich clays which fixed carbon dioxide into oxalic and other [[dicarboxylic acid]]s. This system of replicating clays and their metabolic phenotype then evolved into the sulfide rich region of the hotspring acquiring the ability to fix nitrogen. Finally phosphate was incorporated into the evolving system which allowed the synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids. If biosynthesis recapitulates biopoiesis, then the synthesis of amino acids preceded the synthesis of the purine and pyrimidine bases. Furthermore the polymerization of the amino acid thioesters into polypeptides preceded the directed polymerization of amino acid esters by polynucleotides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hartman |first=Hyman |date=October 1998 |title=Photosynthesis and the Origin of Life |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |volume=28 |issue=4–6 |pages=515–521 |bibcode=1998OLEB...28..515H |doi=10.1023/A:1006548904157 |issn=0169-6149 |pmid=11536891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Fluctuating hydrothermal pools on volcanic islands or proto-continents ===
[[Armid Mulkidjanian]] and co-authors think that the marine environments did not provide the [[ionic balance]] and composition universally found in cells, as well as of ions required by essential proteins and ribozymes found in virtually all living organisms, especially with respect to K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ratio, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and phosphate concentrations. The only known environments that mimic the needed conditions on Earth are found in [[terrestrial hydrothermal pool]]s fed by steam vents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, mineral deposits in these environments under an anoxic atmosphere would have suitable pH (as opposed to current pools in an oxygenated atmosphere), contain precipitates of sulfide minerals that block harmful UV radiation, have wetting/drying cycles that concentrate substrate solutions to concentrations amenable to spontaneous formation of polymers of nucleic acids, polyesters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chandru |first1=Kuhan |last2=Guttenberg |first2=Nicholas |last3=Giri |first3=Chaitanya |last4=Hongo |first4=Yayoi |last5=Butch |first5=Christopher |last6=Mamajanov |first6=Irena |last7=Cleaves |first7=H.

[[Bruce Damer]] and [[David Deamer]] have come to the conclusion that [[cell membrane]]s cannot be formed in salty [[seawater]], and must therefore have originated in freshwater. Before the continents formed, the only dry land on Earth would be volcanic islands, where rainwater would form ponds where lipids could form the first stages towards cell membranes. These predecessors of true cells are assumed to have behaved more like a [[superorganism]] rather than individual structures, where the porous membranes would house molecules which would leak out and enter other protocells. Only when true cells had evolved would they gradually adapt to saltier environments and enter the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Damer |first1=Bruce |last2=Deamer |first2=David |date=13 March 2015 |title=Coupled Phases and Combinatorial Selection in Fluctuating Hydrothermal Pools: A Scenario to Guide Experimental Approaches to the Origin of Cellular Life |journal=Life |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=872–887 |doi=10.3390/life5010872 |issn=2075-1729 |pmc=4390883 |pmid=25780958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colín-García ''et al.'' (2016) discuss the advantages and disadvantages of hydrothermal vents as primitive environments.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; They mention the exergonic reactions in such systems could have been a source of free energy that promoted chemical reactions, additional to their high mineralogical diversity which implies the induction of important chemical gradients, thus favoring the interaction between electron donors and acceptors. Colín-García ''et al.'' (2016) also summarize a set of experiments proposed to test the role of hydrothermal vents in prebiotic synthesis.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

=== Information theory ===
A theory that speaks to the origin of life on Earth and other rocky planets posits life as an [[Information theory|information system]] in which information content grows because of selection. Life must start with minimum possible information, or minimum possible departure from thermodynamic equilibrium, and it requires thermodynamically free energy accessible by means of its information content. The most benign circumstances, minimum [[entropy]] variations with abundant free energy, suggest the [[Characterisation of pore space in soil|pore space]] in the first few kilometres of the surface. Free energy is derived from the condensed products of the chemical reactions taking place in the cooling nebula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Colgate| first=S.

The relationship between '''[[BDSM]] and the law''' changes significantly from nation to nation. It is entirely dependent on the legal situation in individual countries whether the practice of BDSM has any criminal relevance or legal consequences. Criminalization of consensually implemented BDSM practices is usually not with explicit reference to BDSM, but results from the fact that such behavior as spanking or cuffing someone could be considered a breach of personal rights, which in principle constitutes a criminal offense. In Germany, Netherlands, [[Japan]] and [[Scandinavia]], such behavior is legal in principle. In Austria the legal status is not clear, while in Switzerland some BDSM practices can be considered criminal. Spectacular incidents like the US scandal of ''[[People v. Jovanovic]]'' and the British [[Operation Spanner]] demonstrate the degree to which difficult grey areas can pose a problem for the individuals and authorities involved. It is very important to learn the legal status of the right of consent in the judicial statue of the country of resident for the practitioners of BDSM.

==Current status==

===Austria===
§90 of the criminal code declares bodily injury (§§ 83, 84) or the endangerment of physical security (§89) to not be subject to penalty in cases in which the "victim" has consented and the injury or endangerment does not offend moral sensibilities.  Case law from the Austrian Supreme Court has consistently shown that bodily injury is only offensive to moral sensibilities (and thus punishable) when a "serious injury" (meaning a damage to health or an employment disability lasting more than 24 days) or the "death" of the "victim" results.  A ''light injury'' is considered generally ''permissible'' when the "victim" has consented to it.  In cases of threats to bodily well-being, the standard depends on the probability that an injury will actually occur.  If serious injury or even death would be a likely result of a threat being carried out, then even the threat itself is considered punishable.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}
&lt;!--
Zum konkreten Fall der Körperverletzung durch Handlungen im BDSM-Bereich gibt es allerdings keine gefestigte Rechtsprechung. Es kann durchaus sein, dass der Oberste Gerichtshof im BDSM-Bereich auch leichte Körperverletzung als sittenwidrig und somit als strafbar ansieht. Ob eine Handlung gegen die guten Sitten verstößt, hängt in Österreich nämlich davon ab, ob einem vorbildlichen Menschen die Sorge um die Gesundheit des „Opfers“ wichtiger wäre als die Rücksicht auf dessen Wünsche. Es besteht also keine Rechtssicherheit.--&gt;

===Canada===
In 2004, a judge in Canada ruled that videos seized by the police featuring BDSM activities were not obscene, and did not constitute violence, but a "normal and acceptable" sexual activity between two consenting adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled in ''[[R. v. J.A.]]'' that a person must have an active mind during the specific sexual activity in order to legally consent.  The Court ruled that it is a criminal offence to perform a sexual act on an unconscious person – whether or not that person consented in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman can’t consent to sex while unconscious, Supreme Court rules |author= Mike Blanchfield|url= https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/998055--woman-can-t-consent-to-sex-while-unconscious-supreme-court-rules?bn=1|newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]] |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The practice of BDSM is not generally penalized in Germany if it is conducted with the mutual consent of the partners involved.

The following sections of the criminal code may be relevant in certain instances for BDSM practices:
{{col-begin}}
| width="50%" align="left" valign="top" style="border:0"|
* [[Sexual assault]] (§177)
* [[Sexual abuse]] of persons unable to resist (§179)
* [[Insult]] and insult by deed (§185)
* [[Battery (crime)|Battery]] (§223)
| width="50%" align="left" valign="top"|
* Aggravated battery (§224)
* [[False imprisonment]] (§239)
* [[Coercion]] (§240)
{{col-end}}
To fulfill the charge of coercion, the use of violence or the threat of a "severe mistreatment" must involve an endangerment to life and limb.  In cases where the continued application of the treatment could be ended through the use of a [[safeword]], neither coercion nor sexual coercion may be charged.  In the case of charges of sexual abuse of people incapable of resistance, similar principles apply.  In this case, taking advantage of a person's inability to resist in order to perform sexual acts on that person is considered punishable.  The potential use of the safeword is considered to be sufficient possibility for resistance, since this would lead to the cessation of the act, and so a true inability to resist is not considered to be in effect. The charge of insult (slander) can only be prosecuted if the defamed person chooses to press charges, according to §194. False imprisonment can be charged if the victim—when applying an objective view—can be considered to be impaired in his or her rights of free movement.

According to §228 of the German criminal code, a person inflicting a bodily injury on another person with that person's permission violates the law only in cases in which the deed can be considered to have violated good morals in spite of permission having been given.  On 26 May 2004, the Criminal Panel No. 2 of the [[Bundesgerichtshof]] (German Federal Court) ruled that sado-masochistically motivated physical injuries are not per se indecent and thus subject to §228.&lt;ref&gt;Decision of the Bundesgerichtshof, 26 May 2004, 2 StR 505/03, which may be found at: BGHSt 49, 166 ([http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=en&amp;Datum=2004-5&amp;Seite=0&amp;client=12&amp;nr=29672&amp;pos=19&amp;anz=244&amp;Blank=1.pdf bundesgerichtshof.de])&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, this ruling makes the question of indecency dependent on the degree to which the bodily injury might be likely to impair the health of the receiving party. According to the BGH, the line of [[indecency]] is definitively crossed when "under an objectively prescient consideration of all relevant circumstances the party granting consent could be brought into concrete danger of death by the act of bodily injury." In its ruling, the court overturned a verdict by the Provincial Court of Kassel, according to which a man who had choked his partner and thereby involuntarily strangled her, had been sentenced to probation for negligent manslaughter.  The court had rejected a conviction on charges of bodily injury leading to death on the grounds that the victim had, in its opinion, consented to the act. Following cases in which sado-masochistic practices had been repeatedly used as pressure tactics against former partners in custody cases, the Appeals Court of [[Hamm]] ruled in February 2006 that sexual inclinations toward sado-masochism are no indication of a lack of capabilities for successful childraising.&lt;ref&gt;Appeals Court of Hamm in its judgement of 1 February 2006, case number 10 UF 147/04, available online at the [http://www.justiz.nrw.de/ses/nrwesearch.php# Portal of the North Rhine-Westfalian Ministry of Justice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217060746/http://www.justiz.nrw.de/ses/nrwesearch.php |date=17 December 2004 }} (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
For Italian law, BDSM is right on the border between crime and legality, and everything lies in the interpretation of the Code by the judge. This concept is that anyone willingly causing "injury" to another person is to be punished. In this context, though, "injury" is legally defined as "anything causing a condition of illness", and "illness" is ill-defined itself in two different legal ways. The first is "any anatomical or functional alteration of the organism" (thus technically including little scratches and bruises too); The second is "a significant worsening of a previous condition relevant to organic and relational processes, requiring any kind of therapy". This makes it somewhat risky to play with someone, as later the "victim" might call for foul play using any sort of little mark as evidence against the partner. Also, any injury requiring over 20 days of medical care must be denounced by the professional medic who discovers it, leading to automatic indictment of the person who caused it. BDSM play between nonconsenting adults or minors or in public is of course punished according to normal laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ayzad.com/ Ayzad], ''BDSM – Guida per esploratori dell'erotismo estremo'', Castelvecchi, 2004 {{ISBN|88-7615-025-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nordic countries===
In September 2010, a Swedish court ruled that a 32-year-old man was acquitted of assault for engaging in consensual BDSM play with a 16-year-old woman (the [[age of consent]] in Sweden is 15).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/29302/20100928 Man freed in landmark S&amp;M case]&lt;/ref&gt;  Norway's legal system has likewise taken a similar position,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revisef65.org/loven.html SM og loven] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; that safe and consensual BDSM play should not be subject to criminal prosecution.  This parallels the stance of the mental health professions in the Nordic countries, which have removed sadomasochism from their respective lists of psychiatric illnesses.

===Switzerland===
The age of consent in Switzerland is 16 years, which also applies for BDSM play. Children (i.e. those under 16) are not subject to punishment for BDSM play as long as the age difference between them is less than three years.  Certain practices, however, require granting consent to light injuries and thus are only allowed for those over 18. Since Articles 135 and 197 of the Swiss Criminal Code were tightened, on 1 April 2002, ownership of "objects or demonstrations [...] which depict sexual acts with violent content" is punishable. This law amounts to a general criminalization of sado-masochists, since nearly every sado-masochist will have some kind of media which fulfill these criteria.  Critics also object to the wording of the law, which puts sado-masochists in the same category as [[pedophilia|pedophiles]] and [[pederasty|pederasts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ig-bdsm.ch/index.php?pid=24 Interessengemeinschaft BDSM Schweiz] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
British law does not recognize the possibility of consenting to [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm|actual bodily harm]]. Such acts are illegal, even between consenting adults, and these laws are enforced ([[R v Brown]] being the leading case).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spannertrust.org/documents/sexualoffencesreview.asp|title=Spanner Trust submission to the Home Office Review Board on Sexual Offences|publisher=The Spanner Trust|accessdate=27 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071214235525/http://www.spannertrust.org/documents/sexualoffencesreview.asp| archivedate= 14 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; R v Brown dismissed the defence of consent, meaning that the men charged of sexual offences could not defend their actions. It has been pointed out that people can consent to activities such as boxing and body piercing, which also result in pain, but apparently cannot consent to BDSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137476159.0009]|title=Roffee, James (2015). When Yes Actually Means Yes in Rape Justice. 72 - 91|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202053600/http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137476159.0009|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the situation that, while Great Britain and especially London are world centers of the closely related fetish scene, there are only very private events for the BDSM scene which are in no way comparable to the German "Play party" scene.

[[Operation Spanner]] was the name of an operation carried out by police in the United Kingdom city of Manchester in 1987, as a result of which a group of homosexual men were convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm for their involvement in consensual sadomasochism over a ten-year period. The resulting [[House of Lords]] case (''[[R v Brown]]'', colloquially known as "the Spanner case") ruled that [[informed consent|consent]] was not a valid legal defence for [[wounding]] and [[actual bodily harm]] in the UK, except as a foreseeable incident of a lawful activity in which the person injured was participating, e.g. surgery. Following Operation Spanner the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in January 1999 in [[Laskey, Jaggard and Brown v. United Kingdom]] that no violation of [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8]] occurred because the amount of physical or psychological harm that the law allows between any two people, even consenting adults, is to be determined by the [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]] the individuals live in, as it is the State's responsibility to balance the concerns of [[public health]] and well-being with the amount of control a State should be allowed to exercise over its citizens. In the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill 2007, the British Government cited the Spanner case as justification for criminalizing images of consensual acts, as part of its proposed criminalization of possession of ''"[[extreme pornography]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons: ''[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmbills/130/en/07130x-n.htm#index_link_206 Criminal Justice And Immigration Bill]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014]] the video distribution of some BDSM practices has become illegal.

=== United States ===
The United States Federal law does not list a specific criminal determination for consensual BDSM acts. Many BDSM practitioners cite the legal decision of ''[[People v. Jovanovic]]'', 95 N.Y.2d 846 (2000), or the "Cybersex Torture Case", {{citation needed|date=July 2015}} which was the first U.S. appellate decision to hold (in effect) that one does not commit assault if the victim consents. However, many individual states do criminalize specific BDSM actions within their state borders.  Some states specifically address the idea of "consent to BDSM acts" within their assault laws, such as the state of New Jersey, which defines "simple assault" to be "a disorderly persons offense unless committed in a fight or scuffle ''entered into by mutual consent'', in which case it is a petty disorderly persons offense".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://njlawman.com/legal%20research/2c.htm |title=New Jersey NJ Criminal Offenses&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=14 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104155828/http://njlawman.com/legal%20research/2c.htm |archive-date=4 November 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oregon Ballot Measure 9]] was a [[initiative|ballot measure]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]] in [[1992 in the United States|1992]], concerning sadism, masochism, [[gay rights]], pedophilia, and [[public education]], that drew widespread national attention. It would have added the following text to the [[Oregon Constitution]]:
{{cquote|All governments in Oregon may not use their monies or properties to promote, encourage or facilitate [[homosexuality]], [[pedophilia]], [[Sadism and Masochism|sadism]] or masochism. All levels of government, including [[public education]] systems, must assist in setting a standard for Oregon's youth which recognizes that these behaviors are abnormal, wrong, unnatural and perverse and they are to be discouraged and avoided.}}
It was defeated in the November 3, 1992 [[general election]] with 638,527 votes in favor, 828,290 votes against.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Documents/elections/initiative.pdf Oregon Blue Book: Initiative, Referendum and Recall: 1902-2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for Jewish Art''' ('''CJA''') is a research institute at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], devoted to the documentation and research of Jewish visual culture. Established in 1979, it documented and researched objects of Jewish art in ca. 700 museums, libraries, private collections and synagogues in 41 countries. Today, the Center's archives and collections constitute the largest and most comprehensive body of information on Jewish art in existence. The CJA’s research and documentation is included in the Bezalel Narkiss Index of Jewish Art.

==History==
The Center for Jewish Art at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] was established in 1979 by Professor [[Bezalel Narkiss]], [[Israel Prize]] laureate, with an aim to document objects of Jewish art and produce a comprehensive iconographical index of Jewish subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cja.huji.ac.il/About_Us.html |title=About Us |publisher=Cja.huji.ac.il |date=2015-02-09 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center was an outcome of Narkiss’s iconographical research of medieval Hebrew illuminated manuscripts, which he initiated with Professor Gabrielle Sed-Rajna in 1974. The Index initially consisted of four sections: a Section of Hebrew Illuminated Manuscripts, of Sacred and Ritual Objects, of Ancient Jewish Art, and of Modern Jewish Art.

Professor [[Bezalel Narkiss]] headed the CJA until 1991. The next director, Professor Aliza Cohen-Mushlin, established a fifth section for Jewish Ritual Architecture and Funerary Art. Under her leadership the CJA undertook many research expeditions to post-Communist Central and Eastern Europe, in order to measure endangered synagogues and tombstones in regions, which were previously inaccessible to western scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://thesourceisrael.com/issue19/tour_article/ |title=Center for Jewish Art &amp;#124; The Source |website=Thesourceisrael.com |date=2006-02-22 |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, from 1994 CJA documented those synagogues in Germany which survived the Nazi regime and were not demolished in [[Kristallnacht]]. The documentation projects in Germany were done in cooperation with the Department of Architectural History at the Technical University in Braunschweig, headed by Professor Harmen H. Thies. In 1997 this cooperation was institutionalized as Bet Tfila Research Unit for Jewish Architecture in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bet-tfila.org/indexen.html |title=Bet Tfila – Forschungsstelle |website=Bet-tfila.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bezalel Narkiss Index of Jewish Art==
The Bezalel Narkiss Index of Jewish Art is a largest virtual Jewish museum in the word, which includes about 250,000 images from ca. 700 museums, libraries, private collections and synagogues in 41 countries, as well as architectural plans of ca. 1,500 synagogues documented in situ. The images are classified according to their iconographical subject, type of objects, origin, and date. The digitization of the Index is being undertaken in cooperation with the [[National Library of Israel]] and the Judaica Division of [[Harvard University Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/gallery/art/1.1641039 |title=המרכז לאמנות יהודית יזכה לתמיכה של 3 מיליון שקל - אמנות - הארץ |publisher=Haaretz.co.il |date=2012-02-14 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/English/digitallibrary/cja/Pages/default.aspx |title=The Center for Jewish Art Collection |publisher=Web.nli.org.il |date=2010-10-07 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.slideshare.net/evaminerva/d1-vladimir-levincenterforjewish-artevaminerva2013 |title=D1 vladimir levin center for jewish art eva minerva 2013 |website=Slideshare.net |date= |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chemical safety assessment''' ('''CSA''') "has to be performed by registrants for substances manufactured and imported in quantities starting at 10 tonnes per year and by downstream users if their uses are not addressed by their supplier," according to REACH ([[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]]) legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidance.echa.europa.eu/chemical_safety_en.htm|title=Chemical Safety Assessment and Report|accessdate=2010-01-08|publisher=guidance.echa.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CSA includes the evaluation of all available relevant information in order to assess risks arising from the manufacture and/or use of a substance. The process needs to be documented adequately and the results have to be documented in a [[chemical safety report]] (CSR), which is to be submitted to the [[European Chemicals Agency]] as part of the respective registration dossier.
The purpose is to ensure that the risks related to the substance are controlled.

The [[chemical safety]] assessment of a substance comprises the following steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dguv.de/ifa/en/fac/reach/sbericht/index.jsp|title=Chemical safety report – chemical safety assessment|accessdate=2012-03-02|publisher=www.dguv.de|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229125021/http://www.dguv.de/ifa/en/fac/reach/sbericht/index.jsp|archivedate=2012-02-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Assessment of the human health hazard
*Human health hazard assessment of physicochemical properties
*Assessment of the [[environmental hazard]]
*Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) and very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) assessment

The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) has developed a software tool to support industry in preparing a Chemical Safety Assessment (CSA) and Chemical Safety Report (CSR). Chesar Beta version can be downloaded from the [http://chesar.echa.europa.eu/ Chesar website].

==Chemical Safety Report==
Chemical Safety Reports are the main end point for data assessment under REACH (the European Community Regulation on chemicals and their safe use, concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical substances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/reach/reach_intro.htm|title=REACH|accessdate=2012-03-02|publisher=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in which hazard and exposure data are considered together to assess the risk of a substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denehurst.co.uk/id28.html|title=Risk Assessment of Chemicals|accessdate=2012-03-02|publisher=www.denehurst.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''China University of Political Science and Law''' ('''CUPL'''; [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]: 中国政法大学; [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]: 中國政法大學; [[pinyin]]: ''Zhōngguó Zhèngfǎ Dàxué'' abbr. 法大, ''Fǎ Dà'') is a national public research university specialized in [[law]], [[The arts|arts]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[management]] and [[foreign language]]s established in 1952 in [[Beijing]], [[China]].

China University of Political Science and Law is a first tier institution within the national key university [[Project 211]] and the [[985 Innovative Platforms for Key Disciplines Project|Project 985 Innovative Platforms for Key Disciplines]] as part of the national endeavor to build world-class universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cupl.edu.cn/xxgk/xxjj.htm|title=学校简介-中国政法大学|website=www.cupl.edu.cn|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; CUPL is a Chinese Ministry of Education [[Double First Class University Plan|Double First Class Discipline University]] with the highest status "A+" in legal studies.&lt;ref name="Chinese Department of Education"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html|title=教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知 (Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely considered to be one of the best Chinese universities in legal studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zyxw.cn/article/cdetail/3736|title=2016教育部法学院排名名单|last=|first=|date=|website=www.zyxw.cn|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the most competitive and selective universities to enter in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gaokao.com/e/20130618/51c0051a1d4fd.shtml|title=2013年中国大学高考招生50强|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gaokao.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CUPL has two campuses, one in [[Haidian District|Haidian]], [[Beijing]] which is the original campus of the university, and the other locates in [[Changping District|Changping]], [[Beijing]]. The university's Haidian campus now hosts [[postgraduate]] students only while [[undergraduate]]s study at a much larger campus in [[Changping District|Changping]], [[Beijing]]. In 2015, CUPL comprises 13 schools, with 15,833 students and 951 faculty members, of whom 290 are professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cupl.edu.cn/szdw.htm|title=师资队伍-中国政法大学|website=www.cupl.edu.cn|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; CUPL maintains a broad international exchange program, with approximately 1000 foreign students from many countries.

==History==
CUPL was initially established in 1952, with its official name '''Peking College of Political Science and Law''' and combined departments of law, political science, sociology and other subjects of [[Peking University]], [[Yenching University]], [[Fu Jen Catholic University]] and [[Tsinghua University]]. The prestigious scholar [[Ch'ien Tuan-Sheng]] (钱端升), who was educated at [[Harvard University]] and regarded as the founder of modern [[political science]] in China, was appointed as the first president. But after the outbreak of [[Cultural Revolution]] CUPL was greatly affected. CUPL had been stopped during Cultural Revolution. Ch'ien died of illness in 1990.

In 1983, under the policy of [[Central People's Government]] to develop the college quickly and make it the center of politics and law education in China, BCPSL was renamed as the China University of Political Science and Law. The Changping campus was a part of the State's [[Economic history of China|Seventh Five-Year-Plan]] in 1985.

Under the [[motto]] of "Cherish the Moral, Understand the Law, Know the World, Serve the Public"; CUPL made its contribution to the development of legal education and training in China. It was the first university to establish specialties such as Legal History, Civil and Commercial Law, Economic Law, Procedure Law and Comparative Law in the PRC. It also contributed to the education and promotion of [[Roman law]] in China. With over 100,000 graduates in the past 50 years who have become the elites of law enforcement and practitioners in China, CUPL has developed a niche for the enactment and enforcement of law in China. Furthermore, it became prominent in other public affairs in China, among which members of the faculty and student body played an active role in the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] demanding [[democracy]] and [[rule of law]].

To face the challenge of globalization, CUPL developed joint programs with international partners. CUPL provided the first opportunity to study Chinese law in Beijing with an [[American Bar Association]]-approved program inaugurated in 1995 by the [[Duquesne University School of Law]]. In 2008, an exchange program was formed with [[Fordham University School of Law]].

CUPL also maintains relationship with the [[University of Exeter]] and the [[University of Oxford]] in [[England]], [[Deakin University]] in [[Australia]], [[University of Pennsylvania|the University of Pennsylvania]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Washington University in St. Louis]], the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|UIUC]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[University of California, Davis]] in the [[United States]], the [[University of Montreal]] in [[Canada]], and [[National University of Singapore Faculty of Law]] in [[Singapore]].

==Postgraduate Programs==
CUPL also offers two LLM programs and a PhD program for international students in English. One of them is based in Changping and is with the China-EU University. This is an EU funded course, and its main focus is on educating Chinese students on EU law.

There is another LLM program at Haidian campus, in downtown Beijing, which is aimed at International students to learn about Chinese law. There is also a PhD programs in English at Haidian campus. These are flexible and taught entirely in English. They include the option to study Mandarin, and gain law work experience in Beijing and other cities in China.

These postgraduate programs are also open as a semester program to international students from any institution around the world who would like to study at CUPL for one semester.

==Chinese Language Programs==
There are Chinese language programs for international students. These are 8,000 RMB per semester, or 16,000 RMB per year. Students can also stay in accommodation on campus which is 1,000 RMB per year.

'''Comparative psychology''' refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. Research in this area addresses many different issues, uses many different methods and explores the behavior of many different species from insects to primates.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papini, M.R. (2003). Comparative Psychology. In ''Handbook of Research Methods in Experimental Psychology''. Ed. Stephen F. Davis. Blackwell. Malden, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative psychology is sometimes assumed to emphasize cross-species comparisons, including those between humans and animals. However, some researchers feel that direct comparisons should not be the sole focus of comparative psychology and that intense focus on a single [[organism]] to understand its behavior is just as desirable; if not more so. Donald Dewsbury reviewed the works of several psychologists and their definitions and concluded that the object of comparative psychology is to establish principles of generality focusing on both [[proximate and ultimate causation]].  &lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1984"&gt;Dewsbury, D. (1984). ''Comparative Psychology in the Twentieth Century''. Hutchinson Ross Publishing Company. Stroudsburg, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a comparative approach to behavior allows one to evaluate the target behavior from four different, complementary perspectives, developed by Niko Tinbergen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tinbergen | first1 = N. | year = 1963 | title = On aims and methods of ethology | url = | journal = Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 410–33 | doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1963.tb01161.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, one may ask how pervasive the behavior is across species (i.e. how common is the behavior between animal species?). Second, one may ask how the behavior contributes to the lifetime reproductive success of the individuals demonstrating the behavior (i.e. does the behavior result in animals producing more offspring than animals not displaying the behavior)? Theories addressing the ultimate causes of behavior are based on the answers to these two questions.

Third, what mechanisms are involved in the behavior (i.e. what physiological, behavioral, and environmental components are necessary and sufficient for the generation of the behavior)? Fourth, a researcher may ask about the development of the behavior within an individual (i.e. what maturational, learning, social experiences must an individual undergo in order to demonstrate a behavior)? Theories addressing the proximate causes of behavior are based on answers to these two questions. For more details see [[Tinbergen's four questions]].

==History==
The 9th century scholar [[al-Jahiz]] wrote works on the social organization and communication methods of animals like ants.&lt;ref name=Amber-376&gt;{{Harv|Haque|2004|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 11th century Arabic writer [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) wrote the ''Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals'', an early treatise dealing with the effects of [[zoomusicology|music on an imals]]. In the treatise, he demonstrates how a camel's pace could be hastened or retarded with the use of [[Arabic music|music]], and shows other examples of how music can affect [[ethology|animal behavior]], experimenting with horses, birds and reptiles. Through to the 19th century, a majority of scholars in the [[Western world]] continued to believe that music was a distinctly human phenomenon, but experiments since then have vindicated Ibn al-Haytham's view that music does indeed have an effect on animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Plott|2000|p=461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]] was central in the development of comparative psychology; it is thought that psychology should be spoken in terms of "pre-" and "post-Darwin" because his contributions were so influential.   theory led to several hypotheses, one being that the factors that set humans apart, such as higher mental, moral and spiritual faculties, could be accounted for by evolutionary principles. In response to the vehement opposition to Darwinism was the "anecdotal movement" led by [[George Romanes]] who set out to demonstrate that animals possessed a "rudimentary human mind".&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1984"/&gt; Romanes is most famous for two major flaws in his work: his focus on anecdotal observations and entrenched [[anthropomorphism]].&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"&gt;Dewsbury, D. (1978). ''Comparative Animal Behavior''. McGraw-Hill Book Company. New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the 19th century, several scientists existed whose work was also very influential. [[Douglas Alexander Spalding]] was called the "first experimental biologist",&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1984"/&gt; and worked mostly with birds; studying instinct, imprinting, and visual and auditory development. [[Jacques Loeb]] emphasized the importance of objectively studying behavior, [[Sir John Lubbock]] is credited with first using mazes and puzzle devices to study learning and [[Conwy Lloyd Morgan]] is thought to be "the first ethologist in the sense in which we presently use the word".&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1984"/&gt;

Throughout the long history of comparative psychology, repeated attempts have been made to enforce a more disciplined approach, in which similar studies are carried out on animals of different species, and the results interpreted in terms of their different phylogenetic or ecological backgrounds. Behavioral ecology in the 1970s gave a more solid base of knowledge against which a true comparative psychology could develop. However, the broader use of the term "comparative psychology" is enshrined in the names of learned societies and academic journals, not to mention in the minds of psychologists of other specialisms, so the label of the field is never likely to disappear completely.

A persistent question with which comparative psychologists have been faced is the relative intelligence of different species of animal. Indeed, some early attempts at a genuinely comparative psychology involved evaluating how well animals of different species could learn different tasks. These attempts floundered; in retrospect it can be seen that they were not sufficiently sophisticated, either in their analysis of the demands of different tasks, or in their choice of species to compare.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"/&gt;  However, the definition of "intelligence" in comparative psychology is deeply affected by anthropomorphism, and focuses on simple tasks, complex problems, reversal learning, learning sets, and delayed alternation are plagued with practical and theoretical problems.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"/&gt; In the literature, "intelligence" is defined as whatever is closest to human performance and neglects behaviors that humans are usually incapable of (e.g. [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]]).&lt;ref name="Wynne, C. D. L., 1978"&gt;Wynne, C. D. L. (1978). ''Animal Cognition: The Mental Lives of Animals''. Palgrave. New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, comparative researchers encounter problems associated with individual differences, differences in motivation, differences in reinforcement, differences in sensory function, differences in motor capacities, and species-typical preparedness (i.e. some species have evolved to acquire some behaviors quicker than other behaviors).&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"/&gt;

==Species studied==
[[Image:Cat brain.jpg|right|thumb|the brain of a cat]]
A wide variety of species have been studied by comparative psychologists. However, a small number have dominated the scene. [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s early work used dogs; although they have been the subject of occasional studies, since then they have not figured prominently. Increasing interest in the study of abnormal animal behavior has led to a return to the study of most kinds of domestic animal. [[Edward Thorndike|Thorndike]] began his studies with cats, but American comparative psychologists quickly shifted to the more economical [[rat]], which remained the almost invariable subject for the first half of the 20th century and continues to be used.

Skinner introduced the use of [[pigeon]]s, and they continue to be important in some fields. There has always been interest in studying various species of [[primate]]; important contributions to social and developmental psychology were made by [[Harry F. Harlow]]'s studies of [[maternal deprivation]] in [[rhesus monkey]]s. Cross-fostering studies have shown similarities between human infants and infant chimpanzees. Kellogg and Kellogg&lt;ref&gt;Kellogg, W.N. and L.A. Kellogg. (1933) ''The Ape and The Child: A Comparative Study of the Environmental Influence Upon Early Behavior''. Hafner Publishing Co., New York and London.&lt;/ref&gt; (1933) aimed to look at heredity and environmental effects of young primates. They found that a cross-fostered chimpanzee named [[Gua (chimpanzee)|Gua]] was better at recognizing human smells and clothing and that the Kelloggs' infant (Donald) recognised humans better by their faces. The study ended 9 months after it had begun, after the infant began to imitate the noises of Gua.

Nonhuman primates have also been used to show the development of language in comparison with human development. For example, Gardner (1967) successfully taught the female chimpanzee [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]] 350 words in [[American Sign Language]]. Washoe subsequently passed on some of this teaching to her adopted offspring, [[Loulis (chimpanzee)|Loulis]]. A criticism of Washoe's acquisition of sign language focused on the extent to which she actually understood what she was signing. Her signs may have just based on an association to get a reward, such as food or a toy. Other studies concluded that apes do not understand linguistic input, but may form an intended meaning of what is being communicated.&lt;ref&gt;Terrace (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savage-Rumbaugh (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Klaus Zuberbühler |title=Linguistic capacity of non-human animals |journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science |volume=6 |date=2015 |pages=313-321 |doi=10.1002/wcs.1338 
 |url=https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10023/8091/Zuberbuehler_2015_WIRCS_Linguistic_AM.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; All great apes have been reported to have the capacity of allospecific symbolic production.

Interest in primate studies has increased with the rise in studies of animal cognition. Other animals thought to be [[intelligence (trait)|intelligent]] have also been increasingly studied. Examples include various species of [[corvid]], parrots — especially the [[grey parrot]] — and [[dolphin]]s. Alex (Avian Learning EXperiment) is a well known case study (1976–2007) which was developed by Pepperberg,&lt;ref&gt;Pepperberg, I. M. 1991 A communicative approach to animal cognition: a study of conceptual abilities of a grey parrot. In: ''Cognitive Ethology: the Minds of Other Animals'' (Ed. Carolyn A. Ristau), Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Hillsdale New Jersey; Hove and London England.&lt;/ref&gt; who found that the African gray parrot [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]] did not only mimic vocalisations but understood the concepts of same and different between objects. The study of non-human mammals has also included the study of dogs. Due to their domestic nature and personalities, dogs have lived closely with humans, and parallels in communication and cognitive behaviours have therefore been recognised and further researched. Joly-Mascheroni and colleagues (2008) demonstrated that dogs may be able to catch human yawns and suggested a  level of empathy in dogs, a point that is strongly debated. Pilley and Reid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=John W. Pilley |author2=Alliston K. Reid |title=Border collie comprehends object names as verbal referents |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=86 |date=2011 |pages=184–195 |doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2010.11.007 
 |url=http://webs.wofford.edu/reidak/Pubs/Pilley%20and%20Reid%202011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that a [[Border Collie]] named [[Chaser (dog)|Chaser]] was able to successfully identify and retrieve 1022 distinct objects/toys.

==Animal cognition==
{{main|Animal cognition}}
Researchers who study [[animal cognition]] are interested in understanding the mental processes that control complex behavior, and much of their work parallels that of cognitive psychologists working with humans.  For example, there is extensive research with animals on attention, categorization, concept formation, memory, spatial cognition, and time estimation. Much research in these and other areas is related directly or indirectly to behaviors important to survival in natural settings, such as navigation, tool use, and numerical competence. Thus, comparative psychology and [[animal cognition]] are heavily overlapping research categories.&lt;ref  name="Menzel"&gt;p. 2, Menzel, R. &amp; Fischer, J. (2010) ''Animal Thinking: Contemporary Issues in Comparative Cognition''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wass"&gt;Wasserman &amp; Zentall (eds) (2006); ''Comparative Cognition''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shettleworth, Sara J. (2010); ''Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior (2nd Ed)'', Oxford Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disorders of animal behavior==
{{Further|Animal psychopathology}}
Veterinary surgeons recognize that the psychological state of a captive or domesticated animal must be taken into account if its behavior and health are to be understood and optimized.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Common causes of disordered behavior in captive or [[pet]] animals are lack of stimulation, inappropriate stimulation, or overstimulation. These conditions can lead to disorders, unpredictable and unwanted behavior, and sometimes even physical symptoms and diseases. For example, [[rat]]s who are exposed to loud music for a long period will ultimately develop unwanted behaviors that have been compared with human [[psychosis]], like biting their owners.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The way dogs behave when understimulated is widely believed to depend on the [[dog breed|breed]] as well as on the individual animal's character. For example, [[huskies]] have been known to ruin gardens and houses if they are not allowed enough activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ian|url=http://www.preloved.co.uk/blog/permalink/17/interview-siberian-husky-club-of-great-britain.html|title=Interview - Siberian Husky Club of Great Britain|publisher=''Preloved''|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs are also prone to psychological damage if they are subjected to violence. If they are treated very badly, they may become dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dass|first=Dr. Amrita|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1081023/jsp/careergraph/story_10004432.jsp|title=Pet Peeves|publisher=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|''The Telegraph'' (Calcutta)]]|date=October 23, 2008|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The systematic study of disordered animal behavior draws on research in comparative psychology, including the early work on conditioning and instrumental learning, but also on [[ethological]] studies of natural behavior. However, at least in the case of familiar domestic animals, it also draws on the accumulated experience of those who have worked closely with the animals.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Human-animal relationships==
{{Main|Anthrozoology}}

The relationship between humans and animals has long been of interest to anthropologists as one pathway to an understanding the evolution of human behavior. Similarities between the behavior of humans and animals have sometimes been used in an attempt to understand the evolutionary significance of particular behaviors. Differences in the treatment of animals have been said to reflect a society's understanding of human nature and the place of humans and animals in the scheme of things. [[Domestication]] has been of particular interest. For example, it has been argued that, as animals became domesticated, humans treated them as property and began to see them as inferior or fundamentally different from humans.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin, Molly. "Animals and Anthropology." Society and Animals: ''Journal of Human-Animal Studies''. 2002. Web. &lt;http://www.societyandanimalsforum.org/sa/sa10.4/mullin.shtml&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Ingold &lt;ref&gt;Ingold, Ted, ed. ''What Is an Animal?'' Routledge, 1994. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; remarks that in all societies children have to learn to differentiate and separate themselves from others. In this process, strangers may be seen as "not people," and like animals. Ingold quoted Sigmund Freud: "Children show no trace of arrogance which urges adult civilized men to draw a hard-and-fast line between their own nature and that of all other animals. Children have no scruples over allowing animals to rank as their full equals."  With maturity however, humans find it hard to accept that they themselves are animals, so they categorize, separating humans from animals, and animals into wild animals and tame animals, and tame animals into house pets and livestock. Such divisions can be seen as similar to categories of humans: who is part of a human community and someone who isn't, that is, the outsider.

''[[The New York Times]]'' ran an article that showed the psychological benefits of animals,&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, Daniel. "Health; Children and Their Pets: Unexpected Psychological Benefits." The ''New York Times''. 1990. Web. &lt;https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/11/us/health-children-and-their-pets-unexpected-psychological-benefits.html?src=pm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; more specifically of children with their pets. It's been proven that having a pet does in fact improve kids' social skills. In the article, Dr. Sue Doescher, a psychologist involved in the study, stated, "It made the children more cooperative and sharing." It was also shown that these kids were more confident with themselves and able to be more empathic with other children.

Furthermore, in an edition of ''Social Science and Medicine'' it was stated, "A random survey of 339 residents from [[Perth, Western Australia]] were selected from three suburbs and interviewed by telephone. Pet ownership was found to be positively associated with some forms of social contact and interaction, and with perceptions of neighborhood friendliness. After adjustment for demographic variables, pet owners scored higher on social capital and civic engagement scales."&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Lisa, Billie Giles-Corti, and Max Bulsara. "The Pet Connection: Pets as a Conduit for Social Capital?" ''Social Science and Medicine'' 61. 2005. 1159–73. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Results like these let us know that owning a pet provides opportunities for neighborly interaction, among many other chances for socialization among people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11708">'''Control reconfiguration''' is an active approach in [[control theory]] to achieve [[Fault-Tolerant Control|fault-tolerant control]] for [[dynamic systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Blanke|Kinnaert|Lunze|Staroswiecki|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used when severe [[Fault (technology)|faults]], such as actuator or sensor outages, cause a break-up of the [[control loop]], which must be restructured to prevent [[failure]] at the system level. In addition to loop restructuring, the [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] parameters must be adjusted to accommodate changed plant dynamics. Control reconfiguration is a building block toward increasing the [[dependability]] of systems under [[feedback]] control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Patton|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reconfiguration problem ==

[[Image:ReconfStructure.png|frame|Schematic diagram of a typical active fault-tolerant control system. In the nominal, i.e. fault-free situation, the lower control loop operates to meet the control goals. The fault-detection (FDI) module monitors the closed-loop system to detect and isolate faults. The fault estimate is passed to the reconfiguration block, which modifies the control loop to reach the control goals in spite of the fault.]]

=== Fault modelling ===

The figure to the right shows a plant controlled by a controller in a standard control loop.

The nominal linear model of the plant is

&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\dot{\mathbf{x}} &amp; = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{B}\mathbf{u}\\
\mathbf{y} &amp; = \mathbf{C}\mathbf{x}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The plant subject to a fault (indicated by a red arrow in the figure) is modelled in general by

&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\dot{\mathbf{x}}_f &amp; = \mathbf{A}_f\mathbf{x}_f + \mathbf{B}_f\mathbf{u}\\
\mathbf{y}_f &amp; = \mathbf{C}_f\mathbf{x}_f\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the system is faulty. This approach models multiplicative faults by modified system matrices. Specifically, actuator faults are represented by the new input matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}_f&lt;/math&gt;, sensor faults are represented by the output map &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}_f&lt;/math&gt;, and internal plant faults are represented by the system matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}_f&lt;/math&gt;.

The upper part of the figure shows a supervisory loop consisting of ''fault detection and isolation'' (FDI) and ''reconfiguration'' which changes the loop by

# choosing new input and output signals from {&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;} to reach the control goal,
# changing the controller internals (including dynamic structure and parameters),
# adjusting the reference input &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt;.

To this end, the vectors of inputs and outputs contain ''all available signals'', not just those used by the controller in fault-free operation.

Alternative scenarios can model faults as an additive external signal &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt; influencing the state derivatives and outputs as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\dot{\mathbf{x}}_f &amp; = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_f + \mathbf{B}\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{E}\mathbf{f}\\
\mathbf{y}_f &amp; = \mathbf{C}_f\mathbf{x}_f + \mathbf{F}\mathbf{f}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Reconfiguration goals ===

The goal of reconfiguration is to keep the reconfigured control-loop performance sufficient for preventing plant shutdown. The following goals are distinguished:

# Stabilization
# Equilibrium recovery
# Output trajectory recovery
# State trajectory recovery
# Transient time response recovery

Internal stability of the reconfigured closed loop is usually the minimum requirement. The equilibrium recovery goal (also referred to as weak goal) refers to the steady-state output equilibrium which the reconfigured loop reaches after a given constant input. This equilibrium must equal the nominal equilibrium under the same input (as time tends to infinity). This goal ensures steady-state reference tracking after reconfiguration. The output trajectory recovery goal (also referred to as strong goal) is even stricter. It requires that the dynamic response to an input must equal the nominal response at all times. Further restrictions are imposed by the state trajectory recovery goal, which requires that the state trajectory be restored to the nominal case by the reconfiguration under any input.

Usually a combination of goals is pursued in practice, such as the equilibrium-recovery goal with stability.

The question whether or not these or similar goals can be reached for specific faults is addressed by [[reconfigurability]] analysis.

== Reconfiguration approaches ==

=== Fault hiding ===
[[Image:FaultHiding with Goals.png|frame|Fault hiding principle. A reconfiguration block is placed between faulty plant and nominal controller. The reconfuigured plant behaviour must match the nominal behaviour. Furthermore, the reconfiguration goals are pointed out.]]
This paradigm aims at keeping the nominal controller in the loop. To this end, a reconfiguration block can be placed between the faulty plant and the nominal controller. Together with the faulty plant, it forms the reconfigured plant. The reconfiguration block has to fulfill the requirement that the behaviour of the reconfigured plant matches the behaviour of the nominal, that is fault-free plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Steffen|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Linear model following ===
In linear model following, a formal feature of the nominal closed loop is attempted to be recovered. In the classical pseudo-inverse method, the closed loop system matrix &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{A}} = \mathbf{A}-\mathbf{B}\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt; of a state-feedback control structure is used. The new controller &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}_f&lt;/math&gt; is found to approximate &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{A}}&lt;/math&gt; in the sense of an induced matrix norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gao|Antsaklis|1991}} {{Harv|Staroswiecki|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In perfect model following, a dynamic compensator is introduced to allow for the exact recovery of the complete loop behaviour under certain conditions.

In eigenstructure assignment, the nominal closed loop eigenvalues and eigenvectors (the eigenstructure) is recovered to the nominal case after a fault.

=== Optimisation-based control schemes ===
Optimisation control schemes include: linear-quadratic regulator design (LQR), model predictive control (MPC) and eigenstructure assignment methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Looze|Weiss|Eterno|Barrett|1985}}{{Harv|Lunze|Rowe-Serrano|Steffen|2003}}{{Harv|Esna Ashari|Khaki Sedigh|Yazdanpanah|2005}}{{Harv|Maciejowski|Jones|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Probabilistic approaches ===
Some probabilistic approaches have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Mahmoud|Jiang|Zhang|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Learning control ===
There are learning automata, neural networks, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Rauch|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical tools and frameworks ==
The methods by which reconfiguration is achieved differ considerably. The following list gives an overview of mathematical approaches that are commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Zhang|Jiang|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Adaptive control]] (AC)
* Disturbance decoupling (DD)
* Eigenstructure assignment (EA)
* [[Gain scheduling]] (GS)/linear parameter varying (LPV)
* Generalised internal model control (GIMC)
* Intelligent control (IC)
* [[Linear matrix inequality]] (LMI)
* [[Linear-quadratic regulator]] (LQR)
* Model following (MF)
* [[Model predictive control]] (MPC)
* [[Pseudoinverse|Pseudo-inverse]] method (PIM)
* [[Robust control]] techniques

== See also ==
Prior to control reconfiguration, it must be at least determined whether a fault has occurred ([[fault detection]]) and if so, which components are affected ([[fault isolation]]). Preferably, a model of the faulty plant should be provided ([[Fault Identification|fault identification]]). These questions are addressed by [[fault diagnosis]] methods.

[[Fault Accommodation|Fault accommodation]] is another common approach to achieve [[Fault Tolerance|fault tolerance]]. In contrast to control reconfiguration, accommodation is limited to internal controller changes. The sets of signals manipulated and measured by the controller are fixed, which means that the loop cannot be restructured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Blanke|Kinnaert|Lunze|Staroswiecki|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3803">'''Cosmopolitan localism''' is a [[social innovation]] approach to [[community development]] that seeks to link [[Local community|local]] and [[Global community|global]] communities through resilient infrastructures that bring [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] closer together, building on [[Distributed Systems|distributed systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/983824383|title=Designs for the pluriverse : radical interdependence, autonomy, and the making of worlds|last=1951-|first=Escobar, Arturo,|isbn=9780822370901|location=Durham|oclc=983824383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmopolitan localism fosters a global network of mutually supportive communities (neighbourhoods, villages, towns, cities and regions) who share and exchange knowledge, ideas, skills, technology, culture and (where socially and ecologically sustainable) resources. The approach seeks to foster a creative, [[reciprocal relationship]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} between the local and the global.

Italian social innovation scholar [[Ezio Manzini]] describes cosmopolitan localism as having the potential to generate a new [[sense of place]]. With cosmopolitan localism, places are not considered isolated entities, but nodes in short-distance and long-distance networks. The short-distance networks generate and regenerate the local socio-economic fabric and the long-distance networks connect a particular community to the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904398409|title=Design, when everybody designs : an introduction to design for social innovation|last=Ezio,|first=Manzini,|isbn=9780262328630|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=904398409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15053">'''Design for the Environment''' (DfE) is a design approach to reduce the overall human health and environmental impact of a product, process or service, where impacts are considered across its life cycle. Different software tools have been developed to assist designers in finding optimized products or processes/services. DfE is also the original name of a [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) program, created in 1992, that works to prevent pollution, and the risk pollution presents to humans and the environment. The program provides information regarding safer [[Chemical substance|chemical formulations]] for cleaning and other products.&lt;ref name=DfE&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice |title=Safer Choice |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC |date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA renamed its program [[EPA Safer Choice|"Safer Choice"]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="EPA-history"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/history-safer-choice-and-design-environment |title=History of Safer Choice and Design for the Environment |date=2017-04-19 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
[[File:Updated Fig.1 Pie.png|thumb|Each piece of the pie chart depicts the role that the individual processes play in the overall design and production of a product.  In recent years the environment has begun to play an important role in this diagram. If any piece is missing, production may not be able to occur. This figure was adopted from Conrad Luttropp and Jessica Lagerstedt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luttropp|first=Conrad|author2=Jessica Lagerstedt|title=EcoDesign and The Ten Golden Rules: generic advice for merging environmental aspects into product development|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Initial guidelines for a DfE approach were written in 1990 by [[East Meets West (non-governmental organization)|East Meets West]], a New York-based non-governmental organization. It became a global movement targeting design initiatives and incorporating environmental motives to improve product design in order to minimize health and environmental impacts by incorporating it from design stage all the way to the manufacturing process. The DfE strategy aims to improve technology and design tactics to expand the scope of products. By incorporating [[eco-efficiency]] into design tactics, DfE takes into consideration the entire life-cycle of the product, while still making products usable but minimizing resource use. The key focus of DfE is to minimize the [[Environmental economics|environmental-economic]] cost to consumers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luttropp|first=Conrad|author2=Jessica Lagerstedt|title=Design and The Ten Golden Rules: generic advice for merging environmental aspects into product development|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=11 November 2011|volume=14|pages=1396–1408|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2005.11.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; while still focusing on the life-cycle framework of the product. By balancing both customer needs as well as environmental and social impacts DfE aims to "improve the product use experience both for consumers and producers, while minimally impacting the environment".

==Design for Environment practices==
[[File:Designforenvironment fig1.png|thumb|Resource consumption and mitigation strategies for product production which minimizes environmental and health impacts.This figure has been adapted from Spangenberg et al.:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spangenberg|first=Joachim H. |author2=Alastair Fuad- Luke |author3=Karen Blincoe|title=Design for Sustainability (DfS): the interface of sustainable production and consumption|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=16 June 2010|volume=18|pages=1485–1493|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.06.002}}&lt;!--|accessdate=April 10, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Four main concepts that fall under the DfE umbrella.&lt;ref name="DfE"/&gt;

* '''Design for environmental processing and manufacturing''': This ensures that raw material [[Resource extraction|extraction]] (mining, drilling, etc.), processing (processing reusable materials, metal melting, etc.) and [[manufacturing]] are done using materials and processes which are not dangerous to the environment or the employees working on said processes. This includes the minimization of waste and hazardous by-products, air pollution, energy expenditure and other factors.
* '''Design for environmental packaging''': This ensures that the materials used in [[packaging]] are environmentally friendly, which can be achieved through the reuse of shipping products, elimination of unnecessary paper and packaging products, efficient use of materials and space, use of [[Recycling|recycled]] and/or recyclable materials.
* '''Design for disposal or reuse''': The [[End-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] of a product is very important, because some products emit dangerous chemicals into the air, ground and water after they are disposed of in a landfill. Planning for the [[reuse]] or [[Remanufacturing|refurbishing]] of a product will change the types of materials that would be used, how they could later be disassembled and reused, and the environmental impacts such materials have.
* '''Design for energy efficiency''': The design of products to reduce overall energy consumption throughout the product's life.

[[Life cycle assessment]] (LCA) is employed to forecast the impacts of different (production) alternatives of the product in question, thus being able to choose the most [[environmentally friendly]]. A life cycle analysis can serve as a tool when determining the environmental impact of a product or process. Proper LCAs can help a designer compare several different products according to several categories, such as [[energy]] use, [[toxicity]], acidification, [[Carbon dioxide|CO2 emissions]], [[ozone depletion]], [[resource depletion]] and many others. By comparing different products, designers can make decisions about which environmental hazard to focus on in order to make the product more environmentally friendly.

==Why do firms want to design for the environment?==
Modern day businesses all aim to produce goods at a low cost while maintaining quality, staying competitive in the global marketplace, and meeting consumer preferences for more environment friendly products. To help businesses meet these challenges, EPA encourages businesses to incorporate environmental considerations into the design process. The benefits of incorporating DfE include: cost savings, reduced business and environmental risks, expanded business and market opportunities, and to meet environmental regulations.&lt;ref name="EPA brochure 2001"&gt;{{cite report |date=March 2001 |title=The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Design for the Environment Program |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=2000132E.txt |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 744-F-00-020.

==How does a business design for the environment?==
A business can design for the environment by:
* Evaluating the human health and environmental impacts of its processes and products. 
* Identifying what information is needed to make human health and environment decisions
* Conducting an assessment of alternatives
* Considering cross-media impacts and the benefits of substituting chemicals
* Reducing the use and release of toxic chemicals through the innovation of cleaner technologies that use safer chemicals.
* Implementing pollution prevention, energy efficiency, and other resource conservation measures. 
* Making products that can be reused and recycled
* Monitoring the environmental impacts and costs associated with each product or process
* Recognizing that although change can be rapid, in many cases a cycle of evaluation and continuous improvement is needed.&lt;ref name=DfE /&gt;

==Safer Choice labeling program==
EPA's DfE labeling program was renamed [[EPA Safer Choice|"Safer Choice"]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="EPA-history"/&gt;

==Current U.S. laws and regulations encouraging DfE in the electronics industry==
===National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)===
EPA promulgated the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] (NAAQS) to establish basic air pollution control requirements across the U.S. The NAAQS sets standards on six main sources of pollutants, which include emissions of: [[ozone]] (0.12 ppm per 1 hour), [[carbon monoxide]] (35 ppm per 1 hour; primary standard), [[particulate matter]] (50g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean), [[sulfur dioxide]] (80g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean), [[nitrogen dioxide]] (100g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean), and [[lead]] emissions (1.5g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NAAQS Table |url=https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table |website=Criteria Air Pollutants |publisher=EPA |date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stratospheric ozone protection===
[[Stratospheric ozone]] protection is required by section 602 of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] of 1990. This regulation aims to decrease emission of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs) and other chemicals that are destroying the stratospheric ozone layer. The protection initiative categorizes ozone-depleting substances into two classes: Class I, and Class II.&lt;ref name="Clean Air Act Requirements"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ozone Protection under Title VI of the Clean Air Act |url=https://www.epa.gov/ozone-layer-protection/ozone-protection-under-title-vi-clean-air-act |publisher=EPA |date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Class I substances include 20 different kinds of chemicals and have all been phased-out of production processes since 2000. Class II substances consist of 33 different hydro-chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). The EPA has already begun plans to decrease emissions in HCFCs and plan to completely phase out the class II substances by 2030.&lt;ref name="Clean Air Act Requirements"/&gt;

===Reporting requirements for releases of toxic substances===
A firm operating in the electronics industry in [[Standard Industrial Classification]] (SIC) Codes 20-39 that has more than 10 full-time employees and consumes more than 10,000&amp;nbsp;lbs per year of any toxic chemical lists in 40 CFR 372.65 must file a toxic release inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superfund and Community Right-to-Know Requirements|url=http://www.epa.gov/dfe/pubs/pwb/tech_rep/fedregs/regsectd.htm#D4|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other regulations===
* [[National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants]] (NESHAP)
* [[Clean Water Act|National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]] (NPDES–Water pollution permit program)

'''District Regionalism''' is a finance-related [[urban planning]] method. The practice creates a neighborhood stock system in which community shares are sold. The term "District Regionalism" was initially used by the administration of the city of [[Guthrie, Kentucky]] as the distinctive traits of each neighborhood emerged during the trial study. The [[University of Kentucky]]'s College of Design became instrumental in devising the study concept, parameters and goals. The practice concerns organizing cities into smaller communities by allowing creating and distinctive regional and cultural references emerge within neighborhoods by allowing the public to transform what is typically considered as government owned areas and [[Blight (urban)|blighted]] properties. The practice has been proven to alter larger sprawling co-dependant cities into smaller self-reliant communities.

== Share System ==
Community shares are sold in District Regionalist environments.{{clarify|date=October 2013}}  As a community is defined by boundaries and image, the collective population of that community issues shares with monetary value. Initially, stock ownership is given to the community in order to promote the process. An increased number of shares allows a larger amount of voting privileges within that community, therefore allowing some margin within [[city ordinance]]s and [[zoning]].  As more community shares are sold, the pool increases for that community allowing them greater ability to project that money towards community projects. In a District Regionalist community, the city never loses over 51% of shares, allowing the city government to retain rights to city property and have majority rule voting privileges.  As improvements are made to community properties, land values increase and improve the value of private properties within those districts. Cities can also use the community district funding pool to match grants at the discretion of a district's approval.  The share system operates on the premise that communities will care for what they own, as opposed to caring for properties owned by cities.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[Image:moderncityhall.jpg|thumb|right|View of downtown Guthrie, Kentucky showing the redesigned street scape {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8764">'''Doctorandus''' ({{IPA-nl|dɔktoːˈrɑndɵs}}; {{Lang-la|he who should become a [[Doctorate|doctor]]}}), abbreviated '''drs.''', is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[List of academic ranks|academic title]] according to the pre-[[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]]–[[Master's degree|Master]] system. The female form is 'doctoranda' (abbreviated '''dra.''', though this abbreviation is no longer used). The title is acquired by passing the ''doctoraalexamen'', the [[Final examination|exam]] which usually concludes university study. Some students will continue to do research under the supervision of a [[professor]], which eventually allows them to obtain the title of [[Doctorate|doctor]].

In Dutch, the words ''doctoraal'' and ''doctoraat'' have different meanings, the first referring to the doctorandus, the second word referring to the doctorate phase or title. The word 'doctorandus' is based on the traditional principle that this degree is a prerequisite and intermediate step for obtaining a doctorate title. However, in the twentieth century the doctorandi have become considered to be graduates and when they can choose a scientific career, the do usually as a paid ''[[promovendus]]'' and not as research students. An exception are medical students, where the doctoral exam is an intermediate step after which the students have to follow internships, in order to obtain the full medical degree of physician (''arts'' in Dutch).

== Netherlands ==
According to Dutch legislation, the Dutch doctorandus degree is equivalent to the [[Master of Arts|MA]] or [[MSc]] degree in English-speaking countries, with the difference that the coursework and comprehensive exams for a doctorate are included in the academic study. After being graduated to "drs.", the candidate can start with PhD-level research and writing the dissertation without any further exams.

The abbreviation is '''drs.''' This means that Dutch graduates who received the doctorandus title may sign like '''drs. A. Jansen'''. After the [[Bologna process]], the title doctorandus has been replaced by the degrees MA and MSc, and those who receive such Dutch degrees may choose: they may use MA/MSc behind their name, or continue to use drs., mr. or ir., reflecting the field in which they graduated. According to Art. 7.20 of the Dutch law on higher education and scientific research,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005682/Hoofdstuk7597869/Titel1/Paragraaf4/Artikel720/geldigheidsdatum_25-08-2011 Art. 7.20 WHW]&lt;/ref&gt; a graduate of a master's degree granted through scientific education (i.e. by a Dutch research university) may sign as ir. (ir. stems from the dutch 'ingenieur' (engineer)) for those who graduated in an academic study of agriculture, natural environment or technical field, mr. (mr. stems from the dutch 'meester' (master) at law) for those who graduated in law and drs. by those who graduated in other fields. According to Art. 7.19a&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005682/Hoofdstuk7597869/Titel1/Paragraaf4/Artikel719a/geldigheidsdatum_25-08-2011 Art. 7.19a WHW]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Dutch customs the degrees granted to such graduates are MSc for engineers, MA or MSc for doctoranduses and established by ministerial regulation for jurists (actually LLM). This means that two situations can be discerned:

# Those who received their doctorandus title before the Bologna process have the option of signing like '''A. Jansen, M''', since the old doctorandus title (from before the Bologna process) is similar to a [[Master's degree]], and the shortcut M may officially be used in order to render such title as an international title.&lt;ref name=nvao&gt;[http://www.nvao.net/titulatuur_nl Titulatuur Nederland] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930061733/http://www.nvao.net/titulatuur_nl |date=September 30, 2011 }} Dutch-Flemish Accreditation Organization &amp;mdash; this source denies that one may bear a [[Bologna Process|Bologna-style]] bachelor's or master's degree instead of the old titles.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minocw.nl/bachelor/355/Titels.html Opleidingen en titels] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210184259/http://www.minocw.nl/bachelor/355/Titels.html |date=February 10, 2009 }} Dutch Department of Education, Culture and Science. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/hoger-onderwijs/titulatuur Titulatuur] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304133509/http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/hoger-onderwijs/titulatuur |date=March 4, 2012 }} website of the government of the Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=royal2002&gt;[http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/hoger-onderwijs/vraag-en-antwoord/welke-titel-mag-ik-voeren-als-ik-ben-afgestudeerd-of-gepromoveerd.html Vraag en antwoord.

# Those who received their master's degree from Dutch research universities after the Bologna process in other fields than agriculture, natural environment, technical field and law may also bear the title doctorandus and alternatively have the option of signing like '''A. Jansen, MA''' or '''A. Jansen, MSc''',&lt;ref&gt;Art. 7.19a, section 2, subsections f and g of the Dutch Law on higher education and scientific research.&lt;/ref&gt; but only as specified on their diploma. In this case, either a MA or a MSc is granted, which entitles one to bear the title doctorandus. This means that people who have graduated soon after 1 September 2002 have no (separate) bachelor's degree, but only a master's degree, which is their first degree.

== Belgium ==
In [[Belgium]] the title drs is only used for graduates working on a [[PhD]], which will then eventually change their title from Drs. to Dr. The title Lic (which stems from 'licentiaat') is used for those who have finished a masters' degree, but it is rarely used.

== Indonesia ==
The degree was also used in [[Indonesia]] until 1994 (because of Indonesia being a former colony of the Netherlands), where it was given to all bachelors except law, agriculture, natural environment, and engineering. The title ir. for academic engineers is still used in Indonesia by those who obtained their degree before 1994.

== Other ==
In Sweden and Estonia the term is used in the form: "doktorand", with the same etymology:  ''he who should become a [[Doctorate|doctor]]'' (but dropping the gender qualifier) to refer to a student reading for his or her doctorate. However, it is not a formal title and is never written abbreviated. Similarly, in Romania it is "doctorand", abbreviated "drd."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5156">In [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[biochemistry]], an '''energy landscape''' is a mapping of all possible conformations of a [[molecular entity]], or the spatial positions of interacting [[molecule]]s in a system, or parameters and their corresponding energy levels, typically [[Gibbs free energy]]. Geometrically, the energy landscape is the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of the energy function across the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] of the system. The term is also used more generally in geometric perspectives to [[mathematical optimization]], when the [[Domain of a function|domain]] of the [[loss function]] is the [[parameter space]] of some system.

== Applications ==
The term is useful when examining [[protein folding]]; while a protein can theoretically exist in a nearly infinite number of conformations along its energy landscape, in reality proteins fold (or "relax") into [[Protein secondary structure|secondary]] and [[Protein tertiary structure|tertiary structures]] that possess the lowest possible [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]].  The key concept in the [[Protein folding#Energy landscape of protein folding|energy landscape approach]] to protein folding is the ''[[folding funnel]]'' hypothesis.

In [[catalysis]], when designing new catalysts or refining existing ones, energy landscapes are considered to avoid low-energy or high-energy intermediates that could halt the reaction or demand excessive energy to reach the final products.&lt;ref name="ChenHo2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Shentan|last2=Ho|first2=Ming-Hsun|last3=Bullock|first3=R.

In [[glass]]ing models, the [[Maxima and minima|local minima]] of an energy landscape correspond to [[metastability|metastable]] low temperature [[Thermodynamic state|states]] of a [[thermodynamic system]].&lt;ref name=Wales2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wales|first1=David J.|authorlink1=David J.

In [[machine learning]], [[artificial neural network]]s may be analyzed using analogous approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1703.07915|last1= Ballard|first1=Andrew J.|title=Perspective: Energy Landscapes for Machine Learning|journal=Phys.

Understanding when this happens can be studied using the geometry of the corresponding energy landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1706.07101|class=stat.ML|author1=Anthony Collins Gamst|title=The energy landscape of a simple neural network|last2=Walker|first2=Alden|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal definition ==

Mathematically, an energy landscape is a [[continuous function]] &lt;math&gt;f : X \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; associating each physical state with an energy, where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[topological space]].

In the continuous case, &lt;math&gt;X = \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of the system. The [[graph of a function|graph]] of a continuous energy landscape is a [[hypersurface]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Hills and valleys in the energy landscape correspond to local [[maxima and minima]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

=== Macroscopic example ===

A well-oiled door hinge has one degree of freedom, so its energy landscape is a function &lt;math&gt;f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. If the door hinge isn't mounted perfectly, the door will naturally swing closed, open, or to some partially open angle when it is allowed to swing freely. These angles correspond to states of minimal energy of the system, or valleys in the energy landscape.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2617">'''Equinalysis''' is a [[computer]] [[software]] program designed to capture and analyse [[equine]] [[animal locomotion|locomotion]] by visually tracking and quantifying biomechanical data. The system was developed in 2004 by consultant farrier, Haydn Price with the intent of allowing [[Equine veterinarian|veterinarians]], [[farrier]]s, [[Horse trainer|horse trainers]] and [[Physical therapy|physiotherapists]] to highlight subtle changes in a horse's locomotion and provide a video record of how a horse's movements change during the course of its working life. This then allows the user to improve the horse's performance with various techniques and treatment plans, such as appropriate shoeing regimes.&lt;ref name=Horse&gt;[http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/care/article.php?aid=48415 "Breakthrough in Equine Locomotion Analysis"]. Walsh, Isobel. ''Horse &amp; Hound''. 4/15/04. Referenced March 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==

For the analysis, [[polystyrene]] markers are placed at specific points on the horse's limbs, mainly over the [[joints]]. Then the horse is walked and trotted in-hand, and filmed with a [[video camera]] from all angles on a hard, flat surface. The information is then collated and downloaded on to a CD or DVD, which is analyzed on a computer by an accredited individual. The specialist software program records the movement of the markers and produces data that can be used to quantify stride length, body symmetry, joint flexion and extension, and soundness. The resulting baseline of facts - which is presented in a hard-copy portfolio of information for future reference - then provides the horse owner with a valuable 'baseline measurement' of movement and soundness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equinescienceupdate.co.uk/equinalysis.htm "Gait Analysis in the Field"]. ''Equine Science Update''. Referenced March 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reliability ==
A 2011 study published in the ''[[Journal of Equine Veterinary Science]]'' found the system did not produce repeatable data from day to day, and was therefore not sufficiently reliable for use in clinical evaluations of [[equine lameness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-12-01|title=A Quantitative Review of the Equinalysis System for Equine Locomotion Analysis|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0737080611003790|journal=Journal of Equine Veterinary Science|language=en|volume=31|issue=12|pages=717–721|doi=10.1016/j.jevs.2011.05.016|issn=0737-0806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fermata''' ({{IPA-it|ferˈmaːta|lang}}; "from ''fermare'', to stay, or stop";&lt;ref&gt;Stainer, John and Barrett, William Alexander (1898). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=K2H0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=%22fermata%22+stainer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwja4JKJu93UAhUJyWMKHcpBD2EQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22fermata%22%20stainer&amp;f=false Stainer and Barrett's Dictionary of Musical Terms]'', p.169. Novello. {{pre-ISBN}}.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as a '''hold''', '''pause''', colloquially a '''birdseye''' or '''cyclops eye''', or as a '''grand pause''' when placed on a [[Musical note|note]] or a [[Rest (music)|rest]]) is a symbol of [[musical notation]] indicating that the [[Note (music)|note]] should be prolonged beyond the normal [[duration (music)|duration]] its [[note value]] would indicate.&lt;ref name="Music p. 310"&gt;''The Harvard Dictionary of Music'', p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; Exactly how much longer it is held is up to the discretion of the performer or conductor, but twice as long is common. It is usually printed above but can be occasionally below (when it is upside down) the note to be extended.

When a fermata is placed over a [[bar (music)|bar]] or double-bar, it is used to indicate the end of a phrase or section of a work. In a [[concerto]], it indicates the point at which the soloist is to play a [[cadenza]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

A fermata can occur at the end of a piece (or [[movement (music)|movement]]) or 
in the middle of a piece. It can be followed by either a brief rest or more notes.&lt;ref&gt;McElheran, ''Conducting Technique'', Chapter XVII, "Fermatas", p. 85. The author classifies them into three types: fermatas followed by uninterrrupted sound, fermatas followed "by a short period of silence," and fermatas "followed by a long period of silence." After that classification, the author gives detailed advice for conducting each type.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Fermata is the Italian name for the sign (&amp;#x1D110;), which in English is commonly called a Pause, and signifies that the note over which it is placed should be held on beyond its natural duration. It is sometimes put over a bar or double  bar, in which case it intimates a short interval of [[silence]].&lt;ref name="Grove21"&gt;Grove, et. al.; eds. (1906). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6eS2AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=fermata+grove%27s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwino7CcuN3UAhVC52MKHZmXC9gQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=fermata%20grove%27s&amp;f=false Grove's dictionary of music and musicians]'', p.21. Macmillan. {{pre-ISBN}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other names for a fermata are ''corona'' (Italian), ''point d'orgue'' (French), ''Fermate'' (German), and ''calderón'' (Spanish).&lt;ref name="Music p. 310"/&gt;

==History and use==
[[File:Fermata (Inverted).svg|51px|right]]

This symbol appears as early as the 15th century. It is quite common in the works of [[Guillaume Du Fay]] and [[Josquin des Prez]].

In [[chorale]]s by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and other composers of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]], the fermata often signifies only the end of a [[phrase (music)|phrase]], and a breath is to be taken. In a few [[organ (music)|organ]] compositions, the fermatas occur in different measures for the right and left hands and for the feet, which would make holding them impractical. "In the older music the sign for the fermata is used, as frequently by Bach, merely as indicating the end of the piece, after a Da Capo, when modern composers usually write the word 'fine.' It does not then imply any pause in the music between the first and second part of the number."&lt;ref name="Grove21"/&gt;

In the classical and baroque eras, fermatas were usually points at which performers were expected to improvise cadenzas commensurate with its place in the score: in the middle of a movement required short cadenzas, over a I{{supsub|6|4}} and it implied the kind of cadenzas that are associated with the ending of concerto movements.

The word '''''lunga''''' (shortened form of the Italian ''lunga pausa'', meaning "long pause") is sometimes added above a fermata to indicate a longer duration, the length of which is at the discretion of the performer rather than note values.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Lunga|author=David Fallows|access-date=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fermata square.png|51px|right]]
[[File:Fermata triangle.png|51px|right]]

Some modern composers (including [[Francis Poulenc]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[György Kurtág]], and [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]]) have expanded the symbol's usage to indicate approximate duration, incorporating fermatas of different sizes, square- and triangle-shaped fermatas, and so on to indicate holds of different lengths. However, that is not standard usage. In the music notation program, [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]], "By default, a regular fermata is set to 1.5 times written duration, a long (square) fermata is set to 1.75 times written duration, and a short (triangular) fermata is set to 1.25 written duration."&lt;ref&gt;Spreadbury, Daniel; Eastwood, Michael; Finn, Ben; and Finn, Jonathan (March 2008). "Sibelius 5 Reference", p.284. Edition 5.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a whole note with fermata would last 4+2=6 quarter notes, 4+3=7 quarter notes, or 4+1=5 quarter notes, respectively.

The ''fermata'' sign is encoded in the Musical Symbols block of Unicode as U+1D110 MUSICAL SYMBOL FERMATA:&lt;ref&gt;[http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D100.pdf PDF of Musical Symbols block from the unicode consortium]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;#x1D110; and U+1D111 MUSICAL SYMBOL FERMATA BELOW: &amp;#x1D111;

'''George Kingsley Zipf''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɪ|f}};&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A Pocket Guide to Risk Mathematics: Key Concepts Every Auditor Should Know|first=Matthew|last=Leitch|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2010|isbn=9780470971468|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f8GrzlnMSm8C&amp;pg=PA62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 1902–1950), was an [[United States|American]] [[linguistics|linguist]] and [[philologist]] who studied [[statistics|statistical]] occurrences in different [[language]]s.&lt;ref name="crimson"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1950/9/27/zipf-dies-after-3-month/|title=Zipf Dies After 3 - Month Illness|newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]]|date=September 27, 1950}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zipf earned his bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees from [[Harvard University]], although he also studied at the [[University of Bonn]] and the [[University of Berlin]].&lt;ref name="crimson"/&gt;
He was Chairman of the German Department and University Lecturer (meaning he could teach any subject he chose) at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="crimson"/&gt; He worked with [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[demographics]], and much of his effort can explain properties of the [[Internet]], distribution of income within nations, and many other collections of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Theory of Zipf's Law and Beyond|volume=632|series=Lecture notes in economics and mathematical systems|first1=A. I.|last1=Saichev|first2=Yannick|last2=Malevergne|first3=Didier|last3=Sornette|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9783642029462|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=orSSCf69ZhMC&amp;pg=PA1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zipf's law==
{{Main|Zipf's law}}
He is the [[eponym]] of [[Zipf's law]], which states that while only a few words are used very often, many or most are used rarely,

:&lt;math&gt;P_n \sim 1/n^a&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the frequency of a word ranked ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and the exponent ''a'' is almost 1.  This means that the second item occurs approximately 1/2 as often as the first, and the third item 1/3 as often as the first, and so on. Zipf's discovery of this law in 1935 was one of the first academic studies of [[word frequency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Word Frequency Distributions|volume=18|series=Text, Speech and Language Technology|first=R. Harald|last=Baayen|publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=9781402009273|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fzkQPKoFEb0C&amp;pg=PA1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he originally intended it as a model for linguistics, Zipf later generalized his law to other disciplines. In particular, he observed that the rank vs. frequency distribution of individual incomes in a unified nation approximates this law, and in his 1941 book, "National Unity and Disunity" he theorized that breaks in this "normal curve of income distribution" portend social pressure for change or [[revolution]].

Dedicated on October 21, 1993, the '''[[Cecil Howard Green|Cecil H. and Ida M. Green]] Earth Sciences Research Building''' at [[Stanford University]] houses classrooms, offices, and laboratories for research in the field of earth sciences.  The building's extended basement contains the sunken [[Kresge Plaza]], in which rock sculptures are designed to look like a miniature version of local geologic faults.

The '''health effects of salt''' are the conditions associated with the consumption of either too much or too little [[salt]]. Salt is a [[mineral]] composed primarily of [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) and is used in food for both [[food preservation|preservation]] and [[flavor]]. [[Sodium]] ions are [[sodium in biology|needed in small quantities by most living things]], as are [[chloride]] ions. Salt is involved in regulating the [[water]] content ([[fluid balance]]) of the body.

==Long-term effects==
{{See|Salt and cardiovascular disease}}

About 95% of the world's populations have a mean intake of salt that is between 6 g and 12 g daily. Widespread advice that salt intake be restricted below this range is not supported by evidence from [[randomized controlled trial]]s nor is it supported by evidence from prospective observational studies. In fact, intake of less than 5.8 g of salt per day typically results in activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which leads to an increase in plasma lipids and increased mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Graudal |first1=N |last2=Jürgens |first2=G |title=Conflicting Evidence on Health Effects Associated with Salt Reduction Calls for a Redesign of the Salt Dietary Guidelines. |journal=Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases |date=2 May 2018 |doi=10.1016/j.pcad.2018.04.008 |pmid=29727609}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One report stated that people excreting less salt (thus, presumably ingesting less) were at increased risk of dying from heart disease.

Another meta-analysis investigated the association between sodium intake and health outcomes, including all-cause mortality and [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD) events.&lt;ref name="graudal_2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ajh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/03/26/ajh.hpu028.1.full.pdf | title=Compared With Usual Sodium Intake, Low- and Excessive-Sodium Diets Are Associated With Increased Mortality: A Meta-Analysis | publisher=American Journal of Hypertension | date=1 April 2014 | accessdate=8 May 2014 | last1=Graudal|first1=Niels|last2=Jürgens|first2=Gesche|last3=Baslund|first3=Bo|last4=Alderman|first4=Michael H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium intake level was a [[mean]] of &lt;115&amp;nbsp;mmol (2645&amp;nbsp;mg), usual sodium intake was 115-215&amp;nbsp;mmol (2645–4945&amp;nbsp;mg), and a high sodium intake was &gt;215&amp;nbsp;mmol (4945&amp;nbsp;mg), concluding: "Both low sodium intakes and high sodium intakes are associated with increased mortality, consistent with a U-shaped association between sodium intake and health outcomes".

===Possible effects of microplastic contamination===
Studies have found some [[microplastic]] contamination in sea salt from the US, Europe and China. The health effects of this contamination are unknown because, as of 2017, no studies on the question had been performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Dietary recommendations==
Recommended intakes of salt are usually expressed in terms of sodium intake as an [[Adequate Intake]] (AI) and a [[Tolerable upper intake level]] (Upper Limit or UL). Salt (as sodium chloride) contains 39.3&amp;nbsp;percent of sodium by weight.

As of 2009 the average sodium consumption in 33 countries was in the range of 2,700 to 4,900&amp;nbsp;mg/day. This ranged across many cultures, and together with animal studies, this suggests that sodium intake is tightly controlled by feedback loops in the body. This makes recommendations to reduce sodium consumption below 2,700&amp;nbsp;mg/day potentially futile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2215/CJN.04660709|title=Can Dietary Sodium Intake Be Modified by Public Policy?|year=2009|last1=McCarron|first1=D.

==Labeling==
UK: The [[Food Standards Agency]] defines the level of salt in foods as follows: "High is more than 1.5 g salt per 100 g (or 0.6 g sodium). Low is 0.3 g salt or less per 100 g (or 0.1 g sodium). If the amount of salt per 100 g is in between these figures, then that is a medium level of salt." In the UK, foods produced by some supermarkets and manufacturers have 'traffic light' colors on the front of the packet: red (high), amber (medium), or green (low).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salt.gov.uk/understanding_labels.html Understanding labels]. Salt.gov.uk (6 November 2009). Retrieved 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

USA: The FDA ''Food Labeling Guide'' stipulates whether a food can be labeled as "free" "low," or "reduced/less" in respect of sodium. When other health claims are made about a food (e.g., low in fat, calories, etc.), a disclosure statement is required if the food exceeds 480&amp;nbsp;mg of sodium per 'serving'.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Drug Administration [https://web.archive.org/web/20060321031336/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/flg-6a.html A Food Labeling Guide—Appendix A]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Tasmania]]'s [[Menzies Research Institute]] maintains a website to educate people about the problems of a salt-laden diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltmatters.org/ |title=Salt Matters |author=Dr [[Trevor Beard]] |date=26 March 2009 |publisher=University of Tasmania |accessdate=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the "Drop the Salt! Campaign" aimed to reduce the consumption of salt by Australians to 6g per day over the course of five years ending in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltmatters.org/ |title=Drop the Salt! Campaign |publisher=Australian Division on World Action on Salt &amp; Health |accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, New York City launched the National Salt Reduction Initiative (NSRI).&lt;ref name=nsri/&gt; It is the only coordinated, voluntary effort to reduce sodium in the United States, an effort supported by the Institute of Medicine as an interim goal in advance of federal action on sodium reduction.

As of 2013, over 90 state and local health authorities and health organizations have signed on as partners of the NSRI. Together, the NSRI partnership encourages food manufacturers and chain restaurants to voluntarily commit to NSRI sodium reduction targets for 2012 and 2014. The NSRI aims to reduce sodium in the food supply by 25 percent in five years and reduce population sodium intake by 20 percent in the same time, thereby reducing risk for heart attacks and strokes.&lt;ref name="nsri"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/national-salt-reduction-initiative.page|title=Sodium initiatives|publisher=National Salt Reduction Initiative, City of New York|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-one companies met their 2012 NSRI commitment. Notable reductions include: 15 percent reduction of sodium in Heinz ketchup; 32 percent reduction of sodium in the Subway’s Subway Club sandwich; 33 percent reduction of sodium in Nabisco’s Honey Teddy Grahams; 18 percent reduction of sodium in Kraft Single American Slices; and 20 percent reduction of Ragu Old World Style Traditional Tomato Sauce.&lt;ref name=nsri/&gt;

Separate from the NSRI, a number of major food producers have pledged to reduce the sodium content of their food. [[Pepsi]] is developing a "designer salt" that's slightly more powdery than the salt it regularly uses. The company hopes this new form of salt will cut sodium levels by 25&amp;nbsp;percent in its Lay's potato chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = McKay, Betsy | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704534904575131602283791566 | title = PepsiCo Develops 'Designer Salt' to Chip Away at Sodium Intake | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | date = 22 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Nestlé|Nestlé's]] prepared foods company, which produces frozen meals, announced that it will reduce sodium in its foods by 10&amp;nbsp;percent by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101023180822/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nestle-prepared-foods-company-to-decrease-sodium-by-another-10-by-2015-105520828.html Nestle Prepared Foods Company to Decrease Sodium by Another 10% by 2015"], Prnewswire&lt;/ref&gt;
[[General Mills]] announced that it will reduce the sodium content of 40&amp;nbsp;percent of its foods by about 20&amp;nbsp;percent by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Thomas, Caroline, [http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Financial-Industry/General-Mills-announces-sodium-reduction-strategy/ "General Mills announces sodium reduction strategy,"] Food Navigator, 14 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of chain restaurants have made pledges to lower sodium over time. MenuStat, a free online database of past and current nutrition data from chain restaurants developed by the NYC Health Department, is available to monitor and evaluate these pledges.

In the United States, taxation of sodium has been proposed as a method of decreasing sodium intake and thereby improving health in countries where typical salt consumption is high.&lt;ref name="pmid15485985"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wilson | first = N | title = Salt tax could reduce population's salt intake | journal = [[BMJ]] | volume = 329 | issue = 7471 | pages = 918 |date=October 2004 | pmid = 15485985 | pmc = 523164 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.329.7471.918-c }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incirculation.net/hypertension/NewsItem/Salt-tax-could-massively-reduce-US-mortality-rates.aspx |title=Salt tax could massively reduce US mortality rates, healthcare costs|date=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking an alternative view, the Salt Institute, a salt industry body based in North America, is active in promoting the use of salt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltinstitute.org/About-Us|title=About the Salt Institute|year=2009 |publisher=Salt Institute |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and questioning or opposing the recommended restrictions on salt intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltinstitute.org/Issues-in-focus/Food-salt-health|title=Food salt &amp; health|year=2009 |publisher=Salt Institute |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary reduction==

A [[low sodium diet]] reduces the intake of sodium by the careful selection of food. The use of a [[salt substitute]] can provide a taste offsetting the perceived blandness of low-salt food; [[potassium chloride]] is widely used for this purpose. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends daily potassium intake of not less than 3,510&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;ref name=who2013/&gt; Excessive potassium intake may be detrimental to health, and it is advised that potassium chloride not be used by those taking certain prescription drugs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} The use of [[seaweed]] granules in the manufacture of processed foods is being researched as an alternative to salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Seaweed granules may replace salt in foods |author=Daniells, Stephen |url=http://www.foodnavigator.com/Science-Nutrition/Seaweed-granules-may-replace-salt-in-foods |newspaper=FoodNavigator.com |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 Cochrane systematic review of randomized controlled trials reported that lowered dietary salt intake lowered blood pressure in people with hypertension by about 3.5%, indicating that it might be a useful supplementary treatment for hypertension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graudal|first1=NA|last2=Hubeck-Graudal|first2=T|last3=Jurgens|first3=G|title=Effects of low sodium diet versus high sodium diet on blood pressure, renin, aldosterone, catecholamines, cholesterol, and triglyceride.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=9 April 2017|volume=4|pages=CD004022|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004022.pub4|pmid=28391629}}&lt;/ref&gt; In people with normal blood pressure, the decrease after lowering dietary salt intake was less than 1%. The effects in Asians and blacks with hypertension were greater than in whites, but more studies are needed to confirm conclusions. Effects of lowered salt intake on hormones and lipids were similar in normotensive and hypertensive individuals.

Studies found that excessively low sodium intake, below about three grams of salt per day, is associated with increased mortality and higher risk for cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name="mente_2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="graudal_2014" /&gt;

A '''heterokaryon''' is a [[multinucleate]] [[cell (biology)|cell]] that contains genetically different [[cell nucleus|nuclei]]. '''Heterokaryotic''' and '''heterokaryosis''' are derived terms. This is a special type of [[syncytium]]. This can occur naturally, such as in the [[mycelium]] of [[Fungus|fungi]] during sexual reproduction, or artificially as formed by the experimental fusion of two genetically different cells, as e.g., in [[hybridoma technology]].

A medical example is a heterokaryon composed of nuclei from [[Hurler syndrome]] and [[Hunter syndrome]]. Both of these diseases result in problems in mucopolysaccharide metabolism. However, a heterokaryon of nuclei from both of these diseases exhibits normal mucopolysaccharide metabolism, proving that the two syndromes affect different proteins and so can correct each other in the heterokaryon.

Heterokaryons are found in the life cycle of yeasts, for example ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', a genetic model organism. The heterokaryon stage is produced from the fusion of two haploid cells. This ''transient'' heterokaryon can produce further haploid buds, or cell nuclei can fuse and produce a diploid cell, which can then undergo mitosis.

==Etymology==
The term ''heterokaryon'' was coined in 1965, independently by [[Boris Ephrussi|B. Ephrussi]] and M. Weiss, by H. Harris and J. F. Watkins, and by Y. Okada and F. Murayama.

==Occurrence==
The term was first used for [[ciliate]] [[protozoa]]ns such as ''[[Tetrahymena]]''. This has two types of cell nuclei, a large, [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] [[macronucleus]] and a small, [[germline]] [[micronucleus]]. Both exist in a single cell at the same time and carry out different functions with distinct [[cytological]] and [[biochemical]] properties.

Many fungi (notably the [[mycorrhiza|arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi]]) exhibit heterokaryosis. The [[haploid]] nuclei within a mycelium may differ from one another not merely by accumulating [[mutation]]s, but by the non-sexual fusion of genetically distinct fungal [[hyphae]], although a self/non self recognition system exists in Fungi and usually prevents fusions with non-self.&lt;ref&gt;Glass, N. L. and I. Kaneko. 2003. Fatal attraction: Nonself recognition and heterokaryon incompatibility in filamentous fungi. Eukaryotic cell 2:1-8&lt;/ref&gt; Heterokaryosis is also common upon mating, as, in Dikarya ([[Ascomycetes]] and [[Basidiomycetes]]) mating requires the encounter of haploid nuclei of opposite mating types. The nuclei do not immediately fuse, and remain haploid in a n+n state until the very onset of meiosis: this phenomenon is called delayed karyogamy. Heterokaryosis can lead to individuals that have different nuclei in different parts of their mycelium, although in ascomycetes, particularly in "[[Neurospora]]", nuclei have been shown to flow and mix throughout the mycelium.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, M., C. Ellison, J. W. Taylor, and N. L. Glass. 2011. Nuclear and Genome Dynamics in Multinucleate Ascomycete Fungi. Current Biology 21:R786-R793&lt;/ref&gt; In heterokaryons, the notion of ''individual'' itself becomes vague since the rule of one genome = one individual does not apply any more.&lt;ref&gt;King R.C., Stansfield W.D. &amp; Mulligan P.K. 2006. ''A dictionary of genetics''. 7th ed, Oxford. p204&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic heterogeneity within individual is indeed usually considered to be detrimental, as selfish variants may be selected for and disrupt the integrity of the individual level.&lt;ref&gt;Maynard-Smith, J. and E. Szathmary. 1995. The major transitions in evolution. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Heterokaryosis is most common in fungi, but also occurs in [[slime mold]]s. This happens because the nuclei in the 'plasmodium' form are the products of many pairwise fusions between [[amoeboid]] [[haploid]] individuals. When genetically divergent nuclei come together in the plasmodium form, cheaters have been shown to emerge. However, genetic homogeneity among fusing amoeboid serves to maintain the multicellular plasmodium.&lt;ref&gt;Kuzdzal-Fick, J. J., S. A. Fox, J. E. Strassmann, and D. C. Queller. 2011. High Relatedness Is Necessary and Sufficient to Maintain Multicellularity in Dictyostelium. Science 334:1548-1551&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4201">'''Heterotopy''' is an [[evolution]]ary change in the spatial arrangement of an animal's [[embryonic development]], complementary to [[heterochrony]], a change to the rate or timing of a development process. It was first identified by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1866 and has remained less well studied than heterochrony.

==Concept==
{{further|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

The concept of heterotopy, bringing evolution about by a change in the spatial arrangement of some process within the [[embryo]], was introduced by the German zoologist [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1866. He gave as an example a change in the positioning of the [[germ layer]] which created the [[gonad]]s. Since then, heterotopy has been studied less than its companion, [[heterochrony]] which results in more readily observable phenomena like [[neoteny]]. With the arrival of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] in the late 20th century, heterotopy has been identified in changes in growth rate; in the distribution of [[protein]]s in the embryo; the creation of the vertebrate [[jaw]]; the repositioning of the mouth of [[nematode]] worms, and of the anus of irregular [[sea urchin]]s. Heterotopy can create new morphologies in the embryo and hence in the adult, helping to explain how evolution shapes bodies.&lt;ref name="ZelditchFink2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zelditch |first1=Miriam L. |last2=Fink |first2=William L. |title=Heterochrony and heterotopy: stability and innovation in the evolution of form |journal=Paleobiology |volume=22 |issue=02 |year=2015 |pages=241–254 |doi=10.1017/S0094837300016195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Held152"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Held |first1=Lewis I. |author1link=Lewis Held |title=[[How the Snake Lost its Legs]].

In terms of evolutionary developmental biology, heterotopy means the positioning of a developmental process at any level in an embryo, whether at the level of the [[gene]], a circuit of genes, a body structure, or an [[organ (biology) |organ]]. It often involves [[homeosis]], the evolutionary change of one organ into another. Heterotopy is achieved by the rewiring of an organism's [[genome]], and can accordingly create rapid evolutionary change.&lt;ref name="Held152"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SwansonSchwimmer2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Swanson |first1=Christina I. |last2=Schwimmer |first2=David B. |last3=Barolo |first3=Scott |title=Rapid Evolutionary Rewiring of a Structurally Constrained Eye Enhancer |journal=Current Biology |volume=21 |issue=14 |year=2011 |pages=1186–1196 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.05.056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary biologist Brian K. Hall argues that heterochrony offers such a simple and readily understood mechanism for reshaping bodies that heterotopy has likely often been overlooked. Since starting or stopping a process earlier or later, or changing its rate, can clearly cause a wide variety of changes in body shape and size ([[allometry]]), biologists have in Hall's view often invoked heterochrony to the exclusion of heterotopy.&lt;ref name="Hall1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Brian K. |title=Time and Place in Evolution: Heterochrony and Heterotopy |year=1999 |pages=375–391 |doi=10.1007/978-94-011-3961-8_24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indirect self-reference''' describes an object [[self-reference|referring to itself]] ''indirectly''.

For example, define the function f such that f(x) = x(x). Any function passed as an argument to f is invoked with itself as an argument, and thus in any use of that argument is indirectly referring to itself.

This example is similar to the [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] expression "((lambda(x)(x x)) (lambda(x)(x x)))", which is expanded to itself by beta reduction, and so its evaluation loops indefinitely despite the lack of explicit looping constructs. An equivalent example can be formulated in [[lambda calculus]].

Indirect self-reference is special in that its self-referential quality is not explicit, as it is in the sentence "this sentence is false." The phrase "this sentence" refers directly to the sentence as a whole. An indirectly self-referential sentence would replace the phrase "this sentence" with an expression that effectively still referred to the sentence, but did not use the pronoun "this."

An example will help to explain this. Suppose we define the [[quine (computing)|quine]] of a phrase to be the quotation of the phrase followed by the phrase itself. So, the quine of:
 is a sentence fragment
would be:
 "is a sentence fragment" is a sentence fragment
which, incidentally, is a true statement.

Now consider the sentence:
 "when quined, makes quite a statement" when quined, makes quite a statement

The quotation here, plus the phrase "when quined," indirectly refers to the entire sentence. The importance of this fact is that the remainder of the sentence, the phrase "makes quite a statement," can now make a statement about the sentence as a whole. If we had used a pronoun for this, we could have written something like "this sentence makes quite a statement."

It seems silly to go through this trouble when pronouns will suffice (and when they make more sense to the casual reader), but in systems of [[mathematical logic]], there is generally no analog of the pronoun. It is somewhat surprising, in fact, that self-reference can be achieved at all in these systems.

Upon closer inspection, it can be seen that in fact, the [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] example above uses a [[quine (computing)|quine]], and f(x) is actually the quine function itself.

Indirect self-reference was studied in great depth by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] (after whom the operation above is named), and occupies a central place in the proof of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]].  Among the paradoxical statements developed by Quine is the following:

 "yields a false statement when preceded by its quotation" yields a false statement when preceded by its quotation

'''Jack Dangermond''' (born 1945) is an American [[billionaire]] businessman and [[environmental scientist]].   In 1969, he co-founded with his wife Laura the [[Environmental Systems Research Institute]] (ESRI), a privately held [[geographic information system]]s (GIS) software company.

Dangermond is the company's president, and works at its headquarters in [[Redlands, California]].  Dangermond founded ESRI to perform [[land use]] analysis; however, its focus evolved into GIS software development, highlighted by the release of [[ARC/INFO]] in the early 1980s; the development and marketing of [[ARC/INFO]] positioned ESRI with the dominant market share among GIS software developers.  Today ESRI is the largest GIS software developer in the world and its flagship product, [[ArcGIS]], traces its heritage to Dangermond's initial efforts in developing ARC/INFO.

==Early life and education==
Jack Dangermond was born in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ESRI.com/library/articles/mapping-the-future.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[Redlands, California|Redlands]], California, the son of Dutch immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.nytimes.com/corner-office/interviews/teamwork/topic New York Times: "Corner Office – Conversations about leadership and management"] retrieved May 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  His parents owned a [[plant nursery]] in Redlands.&lt;ref name="howell"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article.aspx?id=503454 |title=Jack Dangermond’s Digital Mapping Lays It All Out |last=Howell |first=Donna |work=Investor's Business Daily |date=2009-08-14 |accessdate=2009-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510064955/http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article.aspx?id=503454 |archivedate=2010-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dangermond attended [[Redlands High School]].

Dangermond completed his undergraduate work at [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona]] (Cal Poly Pomona), studying landscape architecture and environmental science.&lt;ref name="howell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alumnus Jack Dangermond to Earn Honorary Doctorate |url=http://polycentric.csupomona.edu/2005/02/alumnus_jack_dangermond_to_earn_honorary_doctorate |work=PolyCentric |accessdate=2008-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826211248/http://polycentric.csupomona.edu/2005/02/alumnus_jack_dangermond_to_earn_honorary_doctorate/ |archivedate=August 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then earned a Master of Architecture degree in Urban Planning from the [[University of Minnesota]], and a Master of Landscape Architecture degree from the [[Harvard University]] Graduate School of Design [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|GSD]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="howell"/&gt;  His early work in the school's Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis (LCGSA) led directly to the development of ESRI's [[ARC/INFO]] GIS software. He has been awarded 13 honorary doctoral degrees.

In [[law]], a '''merism''' is a [[figure of speech]] by which a single thing is referred to by a conventional phrase that enumerates several of its parts or lists several synonyms for the same thing.

In [[rhetoric]], a merism is the combination of two contrasting words to refer to an entirety.&lt;ref name="Waltke2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce K Waltke|title=A commentary on Micah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k6JM1WpP2NoC&amp;pg=PA456|accessdate=19 May 2013|year=2007|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-4933-5|pages=456–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BerlinBrettler2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adele Berlin|author2=Marc Zvi Brettler|author3=Michael A. Fishbane|author4=Jewish Publication Society|title=The Jewish Study Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aDuy3p5QvEYC&amp;pg=PA2134|accessdate=25 September 2013|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-529751-5|page=2134}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, to say that someone searched everywhere, an expression is that someone "searched high and low". The title of the [[tabletop role-playing game]] [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] is also a merism and refers to its [[fantasy]] theme. Another example of a merism is the [[sword-and-sandal]] movie genre, a loose term for movies made until 1970 set in [[Classical antiquity]].

Merisms also figure in a number of familiar [[English language|English]] expressions. The phrase "[[lock, stock, and barrel]]" originally referred to the most conspicuous parts of a [[gun]] and has now come to refer to the whole of anything that has constituent parts.

In [[biology]], a '''merism''' is a repetition of similar parts in the structure of an organism (Bateson 1894). Such features are called [[meristic]] characters, and the study of such characters is called [[meristics]].

Merisms are conspicuous features of [[Biblical poetry]]. For example, in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:1, when God creates "the heavens and the earth" ([[King James Version]]), the two parts combined indicate that God created the whole [[universe]]. Similarly, in [[Psalm]] 139, the psalmist declares that God knows "my downsitting and mine uprising" to indicate that God knows all the psalmist's actions. In addition, Genesis 1:5 uses "evening" and "morning" as a merism for "one day".

==Etymology==
The term entered English in 1894 in the biological sense, but had appeared earlier in rhetorical contexts where it denoted "'synecdoche in which totality is expressed by contrasting parts' (such as ''high and low'', ''young and old'')". It derives from Modern Latin ''merismus'', from Greek ''merismos'' 'a dividing or partitioning', ultimately from ''merizein'' 'to divide', from ''meros'' 'part, share'.&lt;ref name="EtymologyOnline"&gt;{{cite web |author=Harper, Douglas |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=25 Sep 2015 |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=merism&amp;searchmode=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ODLT"&gt;{{cite web |title=Online Dictionary of Language Terminology |url=http://www.odlt.org/ballast/merism.html |accessdate=25 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal usage==
{{see also|Legal doublet}}

Merisms frequently figure in the writing of [[lawyer]]s, and are a hallmark of legal style.  The two parts of the legal merism "[[Will (law)|Last Will and Testament]]" at one time referred to two documents, enforced in two separate [[court]]s: the ''will'' disposed of a decedent's [[real property]] while the ''testament'' disposed of [[Personal property|chattel]]s.  It became customary to combine the instruments in a single dispositive document, and the name has continued long after the doctrines that required its use became obsolete in [[common law]].

A lawyer who writes a will typically includes a residuary clause that disposes of any property not covered by a prior section.  The weight of tradition is such that the lawyer writing such a document will often phrase it something like this:

{{quote|I bequeath, convey, and devise the rest, residue, and remainder of my property, whether real or personal, and wheresoever it may be situated, to...}}

Traditionally, a gift of real property was called a "devise" whereas a gift of other property was a "bequest". Nowadays, the words "bequeath" and "devise" are synonymous in most jurisdictions so that "I bequeath the rest of my property to ..." is enough in both law and logic to achieve the same result.  The entire phrase is an elaborate merism.  Many [[deed]]s frequently contain a traditional clause that says that the grantee is "to have and to hold" the property conveyed; this usage goes back to the days in which the instruments were drawn up in [[Latin]], and is sometimes called a "habendam et tenendam" clause.  The use of legal merisms seldom if ever adds legal effect to the document that contains them, and frequently increases their reading difficulty.  However, the weight of tradition and the fear that a deviation from the established formula might have unintended legal consequences makes lawyers reluctant to revise the traditional formulae, and their clients, seeing them, at least draw the satisfaction of knowing that their documents appear to be written by a lawyer.

In some cases, the doubling, or even tripling, of constituent parts in these meristic constructions arose as a result of the transition of legal discourse from Latin to French, and then from French to English. During such periods, in an attempt to prevent ambiguity and ensure hermeneutic consistency, key terms were paired with synonyms from multiple languages.&lt;ref name="Espenschied 2010"&gt;{{cite book |author=Espenschied, Lenné Eidson |title=Contract Drafting: Powerful Prose in Transactional Practice |publisher=American Bar Association |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|164–65}}

'''Michael Angold''' (born 1940) is [[Professor Emeritus]] of Byzantine History and [[Honorary Fellow]] in the [[University of Edinburgh]].

==Biography==
Michael Angold was educated at the [[University of Oxford]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]], [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil.]]). He has worked at the University of Edinburgh from 1970, serving as professor of Byzantine history from 1996 until 2005, when he was appointed professor emeritus.

He has worked in the fields of medieval and Renaissance history and is especially known for his contribution to [[Byzantine Studies]]. He has been particularly dedicated to the study of the [[Komnenos|Comnenian period]] and of the late [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]]..

He has been a member of the British National Committee of the Association Internationale pour les Études Byzantines and of the Byzantine Studies panel of the [[Research Assessment Exercise]].

He is a [[Royal Historical Society|Fellow of the Royal Historical Society]].

To mark his retirement the University of Edinburgh held a conference, ''Ethnonemesis: the creation and disappearance of ethnic identities in the medieval East and West'' (3–5 June 2005). The keynote speaker was Dr Susan Reynolds, Emeritus Fellow of [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]], and other speakers included nineteen academics from the Universities of [[Cardiff University|Cardiff]], [[University of Durham|Durham]], Edinburgh, [[University of London|London]], [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], and [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Wisconsin–Madison]], [[The Queen's University of Belfast]], [[King's College London]], and the Institut für Mittelalterforschung, Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften (Institute for Medieval Studies, Austrian Academy of Sciences), which co-sponsored the conference with the Medieval and Early Renaissance Studies Programme, University of Edinburgh.

{{globalize|date=July 2018}}
A '''museum label''' or caption is a [[label]] describing an object exhibited in a [[museum]] or one introducing a room or area.&lt;ref Name="objectlabels"&gt;[http://www.museumprofessionals.org/forum/member-articles/2424-writing-exhibit-labels.html Writing Exhibit Labels / object labels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430212508/http://www.museumprofessionals.org/forum/member-articles/2424-writing-exhibit-labels.html |date=2011-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="EnduringLabel"&gt;[http://www.archimuse.com/mw2007/papers/parry/parry.html The Enduring Label — How Shall We Label Our Exhibit Today? Applying the Principles of On-Line Publishing to an On-Site Exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of various museum labels==
===Introduction labels===
Kim Kenney, curator of the [[William McKinley Presidential Library and Museum]] says that the first label a visitor should see should explain your exhibit display in general. The introduction label should be a “teaser” and talk about the main sections of your exhibit to encourage people to see the rest. If there is something significant or special of the main exhibit, it should be introduced here. At this point the visitor should have a good feeling what the museum is generally about. Visitors should understand immediately what they are going to see and they should desire to want to see the entire exhibit. Perhaps a brochure would accompany the introduction explaining the main museum, the price, and the hours.&lt;ref Name="objectlabels"/&gt;

=== Section labels ===
A section label is a small introduction. It consists of sub-topics in a museum exhibition. Kenney says they should represent the "meat" of the museum. If the section is large, perhaps more than one section label is in order. The description should consist of 100-200 words or thereabouts. The visitor should not be strained to read all the labels, so they should be on the short side if anything.&lt;ref Name="objectlabels"/&gt;

===Object labels===
[[File:Wayne-Thiebaud---De-Young-1 label.jpg|thumb||An object label at the [[de Young Museum]]]]
[[File:Thomas Cole NHS 34.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A decorative museum label at the [[Thomas Cole National Historic Site]]]]
Object labels are the smallest. They just describe the individual object they are displayed next to. Typically the title of the work or a descriptive title phrase is given, followed by the date and place of creation, and the materials or technique of the object. Increasingly, there may be a brief description or commentary. An accession number is often given, and often the accession date. If the object is included in an [[audio guide]] or some other form of tour, there may be a symbol indicating this. Kenney says she prefers in an object label a one word title followed by a 25–50 word description for a museum label. She explains that people want specific aspects of the object they might not notice at first glance or might not have already known (i.e. something unusual, material made of, date of artifact, who made). Most people want to know specifics like when it was made, why it was made, usage and when it became part of the museum.&lt;ref Name="objectlabels"/&gt;

===Credit panel===
Practice varies as to whether accession dates and donor information are included. Some donations, especially from government organizations, may specify a credit on the label. Loaned objects are usually specified in some way. It is the opinion of Kenney that donor information clutters up the object label. She believes it is better to give a list of donors on a credit panel.&lt;ref Name="objectlabels"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Belshalti-nannar's museum label.jpg|thumb|upright|The first known museum label]]
The first known museum labels are from the [[Ennigaldi-Nanna's museum]] originally dating to circa 530 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, ''Excavations at Ur: a record of twelve years' work.'', p. 238 ''The room was a museum of local antiquities maintained by the princess Belshalti-Nannar, and in the collection was this clay drum, the earliest museum label known...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Casey"&gt;Casey, p. "First Public Museum" ''Around 530 B.C.E. in Ur, an educational museum containing a collection of labeled antiquities was founded by Ennigaldi-Nannathe, daughter of Nabonidus, the last king of Babylonia.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum labels of the 20th century and 21st century BCE items found in Ennigaldi's museum were labeled in three different languages on clay cylinders as to what the centuries old objects were.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uv.es/EBRIT/macro/macro_5004_43_1.html THE PRECURSORS OF MUSEUMS]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leon, p. 36 ''When archaeologists excavated certain parts of the palace and temple complex at Ur, they were puzzled to find dozens of artifacts, neatly arranged side by side whose ages varied by hundreds of years. Then clay drums with labels in three languages showed up — the first known museum labels.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Woolley"&gt;Woolley, ''Ur of the Chaldees'' pp. 252–259&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these artifacts were:
* a [[kudurru]], Kassite boundary marker (carved with a snake and emblems of various gods).
* part of a statue of King [[Shulgi]].
* clay cone that was part of a building at [[Larsa]].&lt;ref Name="Casey"/&gt;

Museum-like behavior occurred as early as the 19th-century BCE which gave indications of steps of labeling and cataloging antiquities.&lt;ref Name="Woolley236"&gt;Woolley, Excavations at Ur: a record of twelve years' work., p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001410/141067e.pdf The Role of Museums and the Professional Code of Ethics], p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
A "museum label" cylinder tablet describing 100-year-old antiquity objects of circa 2000 BCE read,{{cquote|These are copies from bricks found in the ruins of Ur, the work of [[Bur-Sin]] of Ur, which while searching for the groundplan (of the temple) the Governor of Ur found, and I saw and wrote out for the marvel of the beholder.''&lt;ref Name="Woolley236"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/alumni.magazine/issue14/14_feature_montebello.html Former Met director—and first-time professor—Philippe de Montebello takes the podium to explain how collectors have anointed “art” through the ages] '' An excavation at the ancient Sumerian city of Ur, in modern-day Iraq, found what is considered the oldest museum label: a 19th-century BCE tablet describing an object, then 100 years old, presented, as it read, “...for the marvel of the beholder.”''&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==Future==
There are studies recently done that demonstrate the feasibility of a wireless Web-based tool for an in-gallery paperless digital label system, perhaps in the form of "Digital Label Towers" or wall mounted digital displays. Some concepts that could be used then is changing configurations of the museum labels, digitally updating the electronic museum label, usability on various display systems, and integrate third party content.&lt;ref Name="EnduringLabel"/&gt; 

Other advanced digital technology used by some museums is the use of [[barcode]]s on their museum labels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001410/141067e.pdf Running a Museum: A Practical Handbook], p. 30 describes bar codes in "museum labels".&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Council for Educational Technology''' provided advice and support for schools and colleges in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland on [[educational technology]], in particular the use of computers for teaching and learning.

The [[Department for Education and Science]] merged the [[Council for Educational Technology]] and the [[Microelectronics Education Support Unit|MESU]] in 1989. The civil servant Noel Thompson, who promoted this change, became its first Chief Executive. It carried out evaluations of new technologies such as CD-ROMs, laptop computers and researched the effectiveness of different methods and techniques.  It promoted the use of educational technology through publications, events, TV programmes.

==Structure and Governance==
NCET was a charitable trust funded by government and formally a [[Non-Departmental Public Body]].  It had a Council (acting as the organisation's Board of Directors), whose Chairman and Chief Executive were responsible to the Secretaries of State of the Education Departments in England, Northern Ireland and Wales.  Its work was outlined in an annual priorities letter from the Department and a senior civil servant and HMI sat on its Board.

==People==

===Chief Executives===
The Chief Executive was employed by the NCET Council to run the organisation and deliver its programme of work.
* Noel Thompson 1989-91	
* Graham Walters (acting) 1991	 	 
* Margaret Bell 1992-1997
* Mike Littlewood (acting) 1997	 	 
* Owen Lynch 1997

===Chairmen===
The Chairmen were unpaid, except for their expenses, they chaired the Council and met with Ministers to agree the work of the organisation. 
* Don Gratton 1989-90 - was a BBC Executive
* Margaret Parkes 1990-92 - Lady Parkes chaired the original Technology National Curriculum Working Party	 	
* John Richards 1992-95 
* Heather Du Quesnay 1995-97 was Director of Education for Lambeth  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.edtechhistory.org.uk/organisations/ncet.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluations==
With the increased resource being provided to schools for educational technology the NCET took on a role of piloting and evaluating new technologies.  NCET’s role was to provide appropriate evaluative evidence to them to ensure that this money was well spent.  It also looked to help grow viable and appropriate commercial markets for IT products and through a number of NCET managed pilots and procurements it stimulated specific areas, for example, the introduction of CD-ROMs into schools.  Similar initiatives of varying scales and technologies including portable computers for teachers, communications technologies, multimedia desktop computers, satellite technologies and integrated learning systems all contributed to keeping UK schools up to date with the changing pace of the technology during the 1990s.

==Research==
As well as providing equipment and materials it was also part of NCET's brief to collate and disseminate research and case study evidence on the impact of IT on learning and educational institutions and to produce support materials for them.  This included support for the Education Department's Superhighways Initiative from 1995-7 which ran 22 projects-supported by £12 million from commercial sponsors-that focus on the application of electronic communications in schools and colleges.

==Publications==
Managing IT
Inspecting IT

==NCET-TV==
NCET-TV was a series of educational TV programmes aimed at helping the UK's teachers gain relevant IT skills.  As part of BBC 2's The Learning Zone, the programmes will be transmitted on the first Wednesday of each month at 4.00am.

==Renaming to form Becta==
Dennis Stevenson was asked by Tony Blair in 1996 to look at the use of computers in schools.  He set up an independent enquiry, a panel of experts who took evidence from a wide range of bodies and individuals and published his report&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson D. (1997) 'Information and Communications Technology in UK Schools, An Independent Enquiry' March 1997&lt;/ref&gt; in March 1997, just in time for the forthcoming election. Following the election Dennis Stevenson advised the UK Government that NCET could be a useful organisation, but it needed to be more closely aligned to government and should be restructured. The organisation was renamed the [[Becta|British Educational Communications Technology Agency]] (Becta), restructured and given the task of developing  "The National Grid for Learning"  (NGfL).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24912">'''New literacies''' generally are new forms of [[literacy]] made possible by [[digital technology]] developments, although new literacies do not necessarily have to involve use of digital technologies to be recognized as such. The term "new literacies" itself is relatively new within the field of literacy studies (the first documented mention of it in an academic article title dates to 1993 in a text by David Buckingham).&lt;ref&gt;Buckingham, D. (1993) Towards new literacies, information technology, English and media education. ''The English and Media Magazine,'' Summer, pp. 20–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Its definition remains open, with new literacies being conceptualized in different ways by different groups of scholars.

For example, one group of scholars argues that literacy is now [[deictic]], and see it as continually and rapidly changing as new technologies appear and new social practices for literacy emerge. (Leu, 2000). This group aims at developing a single, overarching theory to help explain new literacies (see, for example, Leu, O'Byrne, Zawilinski, McVerry, &amp; Everett-Cacopardo, 2009; see also, below). This orientation towards new literacies is largely psycholinguistic in nature. Other groups of scholars follow a more sociocultural orientation that focuses on literacy as a social practice, which emphasizes the role of literacy with a range of socially patterned and goal-directed ways of getting things done in the world (see, for example, Gee &amp; Hayes, 2012; Lankshear &amp; Knobel, 2011; Kalantzis and Cope 2011).

Accompanying the varying conceptualizations of new literacies, there are a range of terms used by different researchers when referring to new literacies, including ''21st century literacies'', ''internet literacies'', ''[[digital literacy|digital literacies]]'', ''new [[Media literacy|media literacies]]'', ''multiliteracies'', ''[[information literacy]]'', ''ICT literacies'', and ''[[computer literacy]]''. In the ''Handbook of New Literacies Research'', Coiro, [[Michele Knobel|Knobel]], [[Colin Lankshear|Lankshear]], and Leu (2008) note that all these terms "are used to refer to phenomena we would see as falling broadly under a new literacies umbrella" (pg. 10).&lt;ref&gt;Coiro, J., Knobel, M., Lankshear, C., &amp; Leu, D. J. (2008). Central issues in new literacies and new literacies research. In J. Coiro, M. Knobel, C. Lankshear, &amp; D. J. Leu (Eds.), ''Handbook of new literacies research'' (pp. 1–22). New York: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly recognized examples of new literacies include such practices as [[instant messaging]], [[blog]]ging, maintaining a [[website]], participating in online [[Social network service|social networking]] spaces, creating and sharing [[music video]]s, [[podcast]]ing and videocasting, photoshopping images and [[photo sharing]], [[E-mail|emailing]], shopping online, [[digital storytelling]], participating in [[online discussion]] lists, emailing and using [[online chat]], conducting and collating online searches, reading, writing and commenting on [[fan fiction]], collaborating on and writing encyclopedic wikis, processing and evaluating online information, creating and sharing [[Mashup (digital)|digital mashups]], etc. (see: Black, 2008; Coiro, 2003; Gee, 2007; Hunter, 2014; Jenkins, 2006; Kist, 2007; Lankshear &amp; Knobel, 2006; Lessig, 2005; Leu, et al. 2004; Prensky, 2006).

==Definitions: at least two 'camps'==
The field of new literacies is characterized by two theoretically distinct approaches that overlap to some extent. One is informed by cognitive and language processing theories such as [[cognitive psychology]], [[psycholinguistics]], [[Schema (psychology)|schema theory]], [[metacognition]], [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]], and other similar theories. This orientation includes a particular focus on examining the cognitive and social processes involved in comprehending online or digital texts (see for example: Leu, 2001; [http://www.readingonline.org/newliteracies/leu/ Leu, Kinzer, Coiro, &amp; Cammack, 2004]; Coiro, 2003; Coiro &amp; Dobler, 2007). Donald Leu, a prominent researcher in the field of new literacies, has outlined four defining characteristics of new literacies, according to a largely [[Psycholinguistics|psycholinguistic orientation]] (see: Leu et al., 2007). First, new technologies (such as the internet) and the novel literacy tasks that pertain to these new technologies require new skills and strategies to effectively use them. Second, new literacies are a critical component of full participation—civic, economic, and personal—in our increasingly global society. A third component to this approach is new literacies are ''deictic''—that is, they change regularly as new technology emerges and older technologies fade away. With this in mind, "what may be important in reading instruction and literacy education is not to teach any single set of new literacies, but rather to teach students how to learn continuously new literacies that will appear during their lifetime."&lt;ref name=Leu/&gt;{{rp|43}} Finally, new literacies are "multiple, multimodal, and multifaceted," and as such, multiple points of view will be most beneficial in attempting to comprehensively analyze them.&lt;ref name=Leu/&gt;{{rp|43}} This orientation makes a distinction between "New Literacies" and "new literacies" theories. Lower case theories are better able to keep up with the rapidly changing nature of literacy in a deictic world since they are closer to the specific types of changes that are taking place and interest those who study them within a particular heuristic. Lower case theories also permit the field to maximize the lenses that are used and the technologies and contexts that are studied. This position argues that every scholar who studies new literacy issues is generating important insights for everyone else, even if they do not share a particular lens, technology, or context; and that this requires a second level of theorising. New Literacies (capitalized), it is argued, is a broader, more inclusive concept, and includes common findings emerging across multiple, lower case theories.  New Literacies theory benefits from work taking place in the multiple, lower case dimensions of new literacies by looking for what appear to be the most common and consistent patterns being found in lower case theories and lines of research. This approach permits everyone to fully explore their unique, lowercase perspective of new literacies, allowing scholars to maintain close focus on many different aspects of the rapidly shifting landscape of literacy during a period of rapid change.  At the same time, each also benefits from expanding their understanding of other, lowercase, new literacies perspectives. By assuming change in the model, everyone is open to a continuously changing definition of literacy, based on the most recent data that emerges consistently, across multiple perspectives, disciplines, and research traditions. Moreover, areas in which alternative findings emerge are identified, enabling each to be studied again, from multiple perspectives.  From this process, common patterns emerge and are included in a broader, common, New Literacies theory. From this orientation, proponents argue, this process enables a particular theorization of New Literacies to keep up with consistent elements that will always define literacy on the Internet while it also informs each of the lower case theories of new literacies with patterns that are being regularly found by others.

The second approach to studying new literacies is overtly grounded in a focus on social practices. According to [[Colin Lankshear]] and [[Michele Knobel]] from this "social practice" perspectives, "new literacies" can refer to "new socially recognized ways of generating, communicating and negotiating meaningful content through the medium of encoded texts within contexts of participation in [[Discourse]]s (or, as members of Discourses) ".&lt;ref&gt;Lankshear, C., &amp; Knobel, M. (2006). New literacies: Everyday practices &amp; classroom learning  (2nd ed.). pg. 65. New York: Open University Press and McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective "new" refers to the presence of two dominant features of contemporary [[literacy]] practices. The first is the use of digital technologies as the means of producing, sharing, accessing and interacting with meaningful content. New literacies typically involve screens and pixels rather than paper and type, and digital code (that renders texts as image, sound, conventional text, and any combination of these within a single process) rather than material print. The second defining feature of new literacies is their highly collaborative, distributed, and participatory nature, as expressions of what [[Henry Jenkins]]&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. (2006). Fans, bloggers and gamers: Exploring participatory culture. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; calls engagement in [[participatory culture]], and Lankshear and Knobel&lt;ref&gt;Lankshear, C., &amp; Knobel, M. (2006). New literacies: Everyday practices &amp; classroom learning  (2nd ed.). New York: Open University Press and McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; refer to as a distinctive ''ethos''.

==Research in new literacies==
Research within the field of new literacies is also diverse. A wide range of topics and issues are focused upon, and a broad range of methodologies are used.

===Online research and comprehension===
One aspect of new literacies that has attracted researchers' attention is school-age children's online research and comprehension. Specifically, researchers are interested in finding the answers to questions such as how reading online differs from traditional print-based reading. Donald Leu, Julie Coiro, Jill Castek, Laurie Henry, and others attempt to understand how students become adept at reading online to learn and how students acquire the necessary skills, strategies, and dispositions required to do so. Initial work in this area referred to online reading comprehension&lt;ref name=Leu&gt;Leu, D. J., &amp; Zawilinski, L., Castek, J., Banerjee, M., Housand, B. C., Liu, Y., &amp; O'Neil, M. (2007). What is new About the new literacies of online reading comprehension?. In Secondary School Literacy: What Research Reveals for Classroom Practice (Chapter 3, pp. 37–68). Retrieved from http://teachers.westport.k12.ct.us/ITL/wkspmaterials/NCTE%20chapter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, the construct "online research and comprehension" is being used since this more precisely describes the type of reading being described in their work.&lt;ref name=Leu2&gt;Leu, D. J., Kinzer, C. K., Coiro, J., Castek, J., Henry, L. A. (2013). New literacies: A dual level theory of the changing nature of literacy, instruction, and assessment. In Alvermann, D.E., Unrau, N.J., &amp; Ruddell, R.B. (Eds.). (2013). Theoretical models and processes of reading (6th ed.). (pp. 1150-1181). Newark, DE: International Reading Association. Available at: http://www.reading.org/Libraries/books/IRA-710-chapter42.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to Leu and colleagues, the new literacies of online research and comprehension is a process of problem-based inquiry using information on the Internet. It includes the skills, strategies, dispositions, and social practices that take place as we read online information to learn and is based around five practices: "At least five processing practices occur during online research and comprehension: (1) reading to identify important questions, (2) reading to locate information, (3) reading to evaluate information critically, (4) reading to synthesize information, and (5) reading to communicate information. Within these five practices reside the skills, strategies, and dispositions that are distinctive to online reading comprehension as well as to others that are also important for offline reading comprehension (Leu, Reinking, et al., 2007)."&lt;ref name=Leu2/&gt;{{rp|1164}}

===Online fan fiction and adolescents===
Recent research in the field of new literacies has focused on [[fan fiction]] on the internet, especially those stories published online by adolescents (see for example: Black, 2008; Thomas, 2007; Jenkins, 2006). Online fan fiction websites, such as [[FanFiction.Net]], are spaces where fans of all ages, but especially adolescents and younger school-age fans, are able to use these new [[information and communication technologies]] (ICTs) to write and craft fictional stories based on their favorite characters in popular media such as movies, television, and graphic novels. Adolescents are participating more and more on these kinds of sites, not only engaging with "pop culture and media, but also with a broad array of literate activities that are aligned with many school-based literacy practices"&lt;ref&gt;Black, R. W. (2007). Digital design: English language learners and reader reviews in online fiction. In M. Knobel &amp; C. Lankshear (Eds.), ''A New Literacies Sampler,'' pp. 115–136. New York: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, adults are just as able to spend time in such online environments—and they do. However, it is interesting to consider that young people were born into a digitally rich world, and thus could be seen as "digital natives", and therefore interact with the online environment in a fundamentally distinct way than an older generation of people, so-called "digital immigrants".&lt;ref name=Hansford&gt;Adlington, R., &amp; Hansford, D. (2009). Digital spaces and young people's online authoring: Challenges for teachers. ''Australian journal of language and literacy, 32''(1, 2).&lt;/ref&gt; As digital natives, adolescents "use the online world to share, evaluate, create, report and program with each other differently to digital immigrants," and they engage easily and readily with new digital technologies such as instant messaging, file sharing songs and videos, and post all kinds of 'texts', stories, photos, and videos among them.&lt;ref name=Hansford/&gt; A central characteristic of digital natives is their "desire to create."&lt;ref name=Hansford/&gt; Digital natives are engaged in "programming to some extent, whether it be by including a piece of HTML code that personalizes a MySpace page or creating a Flash animation. They are creating web pages, blogs, avatars and worlds; and, in stark contrast to digital immigrants, digital natives readily report and share their ideas."&lt;ref name=Hansford/&gt;

===Video games===
[[James Paul Gee]] described [[Video game|video gaming]] as a new literacy "in virtue of the ways game design involves a multimodal code comprising images, actions, words, sounds, and movements that players interpret according to gaming conventions".&lt;ref&gt;Coiro, J., Knobel, M., Lankshear, C., &amp; Leu, D. J. (Eds.) (2008). ''Handbook of new literacies research'' (pp. 251). New York: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Gee notes that game players participate in their game's world as a form of social practice, especially in real-time [[Strategy video game|strategy games]] in which players can compete with each other to build on land masses, for instance, and in which they can shape and convey their virtual identities as a certain kind of strategist. Video games continue to use new digital technologies to create the symbols players interpret to encode and decode the meanings that constitute the game.&lt;ref&gt;Gee, J. P. (2008). ''What video games have to teach us about learning and literacy, revised and updated''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; Many ways in which students learn literacies, increasingly, are happening outside of school rather than inside of school.

Other researchers have expanded the body of knowledge about video games as a new literacy, particularly as they relate to classroom learning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gerber|first=H. R.|title=From the FPS to the RPG: Using Video Games to encourage reading YAL|journal=The ALAN Review|year=2009|volume=36|issue=3|pages=87–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Squire&gt;{{cite book|last=Squire|first=Kurt|title=Video Games and Learning: Teaching and Participatory Culture in the Digital Age|year=2011|publisher=Teachers College Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (see for example: Lacasa, Martinez, &amp; Mendez, 2008; Sanford &amp; Madill, 2007). In one study,&lt;ref name=Lacasa&gt;Lacasa, P., Martinez, R., &amp; Mendez, L. (2008). Developing new literacies using commercial videogames as educational tools. ''Linguistics and Education, 19.''&lt;/ref&gt; researchers examined how video games, supported by discussions and dramatic performances in the classroom, can contribute to the development of narrative thought as demonstrated in written compositions in various contexts. Namely, the researchers engaged primary school children in activities designed to teach them to tell, play out, and write stories based on the most popular video game in their classroom, ''[[Tomb Raider]]''. Although it was a challenging process at times, researchers discovered that the use of new digital media such as video games actually "complements the use of other written or audiovisual methods [in the classroom] and permits the development of multiple literacies in the classroom."&lt;ref name=Lacasa/&gt;{{rp|103}}

==The classroom==
It has become clear to many researchers in the field that new literacies research has important implications for the classroom. Kist (2007), for example, observes how new literacies can be used in classroom settings—from the use of rap music to anime to digital storytelling, there are already instances of teachers attempting to blend new literacies with traditional literacy practices in the classroom.&lt;ref name=Kist&gt;Kist, W. (2007). Basement new literacies: Dialogue with a first-year teacher. ''English Journal, 97''(1), 43–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Kist asks: "Can new literacies indeed 'fit' into how we currently 'do' school?" Kist notes that "the new literacies instruction that does exist often comes only out of the fortitude of lonely pioneers of new literacies."&lt;ref name=Kist/&gt;{{rp|44}}

Knobel and Lankshear (2011) argue that if educators and prospective teachers engage in blogging, or participate in "[[affinity spaces]]" devoted to practices like fan fiction, video game-playing, music and video remixing, photosharing, and the like, they will better understand how new literacies can better be integrated into worthwhile classroom learning.&lt;ref&gt;Lankshear, C., &amp; Knobel, M. (2011). ''New literacies: Everyday practices &amp; classroom learning'' (3rd ed.). pg. 255. New York: Open University Press and McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leu, Coiro, Castek, Hartman, Henry and Reinking (2008) have begun to explore the use of a modified instructional model of reciprocal teaching that reflects some of the differences between offline and online reading contexts. In an instructional model known as Internet Reciprocal Teaching, each student has his/her own laptop with access to the Internet and students work in small groups to facilitate interactive group work and discussions about strategy use.  In addition, Internet Reciprocal Teaching with online informational resources (as opposed to narrative texts) and strategy instruction on both the common and unique processes by which students navigate through multiple and different texts, rather than the reading of one common text. Teachers and students model their choices about which links are most relevant to a group or individual question through think-alouds. They discuss how to efficiently locate information within different kinds of websites, how to synthesize ideas across multiple texts and media, how to make judgments about the quality of the information and the author's level of expertise, and how to best represent the answers to their questions. Responsibility for monitoring and effectively using these strategies to solve online information problems is gradually released to the students  using an instructional scheme with three phases: Phase 1 includes direct, whole class instruction of basic skills and strategies of Internet use; Phase 2 includes group work and the reciprocal exchange of online reading comprehension strategies by students with their peers; and Phase 3 includes online individual inquiry units, sometimes with collaborative efforts involving other students in other classes, perhaps even in other parts of the world, and periodic strategy sessions with groups.&lt;ref&gt;Leu, D. J. Jr., Coiro, J., Castek, J., Hartman, D. K., Henry, L. A., &amp; Reinking, D. (2008). Research on instruction and assessment of the new literacies of online reading comprehension. In C. C. Block, S. Parris, and P. Afflerbach, (Eds.), Comprehension instruction: Research based best practices. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Students "are the first generation to be global publishers to access the raw material of information and to create refined knowledge products for application.  They understand the social skills of working with people who they will never meet face to face.  They also understand that they need to take more responsibility for managing their own learning.  They do not see the boundaries of school as a solid wall.  They see school as a global communications center."

{{see also|Polar climate}}

'''Polar [[meteorology]]''' is the study of the atmosphere of Earth's [[polar regions]]. 
Surface [[temperature inversion]] is typical of polar environments and leads to the [[katabatic wind]] phenomenon. The vertical temperature structure of polar environments tends to be more complex than in mid-latitude or [[tropical]] climates.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The collection of polar meteorology data started in 1893 with [[Fridtjof Nansen]] during his [[Nansen's Fram expedition|North Pole expedition]]. One of the goals of the expedition was to make detailed meteorological and early oceanographic measurements. The measurements made from Nansen’s ship, which was named Fram, were used by [[Vagn Walfrid Ekman]] to develop the theory of the turning of surface flow with friction (the [[Ekman spiral]]).
&lt;ref name="Weatherly"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weatherly | first = John W. | title = Polar Meteorology and Climate | journal = Cold Regions Science and Technology  | volume =  | issue =  | pages =  | publisher = [[Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems]]
 | location =  | date =  | year =  | url = http://www.eolss.net/Sample-Chapters/C05/E6-178-02.pdf | issn = | doi =  | mr = 
 | zbl = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold War===
The [[Cold War]] acted as a catalyst for progress in polar meteorology. Balloon instruments along the northern borders of the US and Canada were used for [[atmospheric profiling]]. North America’s air defenses often used instruments carried on balloons to profile the Arctic. [[Nuclear submarine]]s, which the United States used as a defense mechanism, were equipped with upward looking [[sonar]]. The data were later declassified and  between 1958-1979 became the baseline for assessing the thinning of ice from the 1980s to the present day.&lt;ref name="Weatherly"/&gt; Russia also contributed highly accurate data between 1937 and 1991.

===Present day===
Today, submarine mapping and measurements have been drastically reduced. One classic way to measuring ice thickness is to drill a hole in the ice and analyze the ice obtained. There are also many more complex methods and devices dedicated to measuring and keeping track of weather conditions in polar areas. These include ice mass balance buoys, upward looking sonar from under-ice buoys, and satellites. Global warming has increased interest in polar meteorology. This is because most of Earth's snow and ice are in polar regions, and these areas are expected to be the most affected by the snow/ice-surface [[albedo]] feedback effect. Therefore, if increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration causes global warming, then polar regions should warm faster than other locations on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Guest | first = Peter | title = Climate Change - Introduction

==Topics of interest==

===Atmosphere sea ice/ocean interaction===
Interaction between the atmosphere, ice and ocean is confined to the [[atmospheric boundary layer]], which is mainly influenced by surface characteristics. In polar regions, these are sea ice roughness and sea ice concentration, which greatly influence surface temperature distribution. Wind speed and direction, the temperature of the air, and the location of the wind contact are other factors.&lt;ref name="Wegener"&gt;{{cite web | last = Wacker | first = U. | title = Polar Meteorology | work = | publisher = Alfred Wegener Institute | date = | url = http://www.awi.de/en/research/research_divisions/climate_science/polar_meteorology/ | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070220022815/http://www.awi.de/en/research/research_divisions/climate_science/polar_meteorology/| doi = | accessdate = 01-10-2013 | dead-url = yes | archivedate =2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sea ice and wind have great impact on the atmospheric boundary layer, which is often used to measure conditions in polar areas.

=== Polar clouds and precipitation ===
The atmospheric portion of the hydrological cycle in polar regions plays an important role  in that:&lt;ref name="Wegener" /&gt;
* the balance of polar ice masses is inseparably linked to precipitation,
* clouds modify the [[radiation transfer]],
* the release of [[latent heat]] modifies the temperature of the air, hence circulations.

===Carbon dioxide and methane===
Carbon dioxide (C02) is of particular interest in polar meteorology because it affects the melting of sea ice. 
Human activity releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from burning oil, coal and natural gas.
A dozen pounds of Arctic sea ice disappears for every pound of carbon dioxide released. This highlights the heating power of carbon dioxide, which pumps 100,000 times more energy into our climate than was given off when the oil, coal or natural gas was burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouverobserver.com/blogs/climatesnapshot/arctic-death-spiral-leaves-climate-scientists-shocked-and-worried |title=Arctic "death spiral" leaves climate scientists shocked and worried |publisher=Vancouver Observer |date=2012-09-19 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; White Arctic ice, currently at its lowest level in recent history, is causing more absorption. Prof Wadhams, in a recent BBC article, calculates that this absorption of the sun's rays is having an effect "the equivalent of about 20 years of additional CO2 being added by man". The Cambridge University expert says that the Arctic ice cap is "heading for oblivion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watts |first=Susan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19496674 |title=BBC News - Arctic ice melt 'like adding 20 years of CO2 emissions' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-09-06 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Methane]], a potent greenhouse gas, introduces a significant [[positive feedback]] as global warming leads to the retreat of vast permafrost regions in the northern hemisphere. As permafrost retreats, more areas become emitters of methane. Estimations of the [[methane emissions]] from northern swamps vary strongly due to (1) the extensive variability of methane emission between and within different swamp areas, (2) the very limited knowledge of these fluxes for various types of soils, and (3) the lack of representative data for vast areas like the enormous swamps, e.g., in Sibiria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awi.de/en/research/research_divisions/climate_science/polar_meteorology/methane/ |title=Alfred Wegener Institute Methane |publisher=Awi.de |date= |accessdate=2014-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407105301/http://www.awi.de/en/research/research_divisions/climate_science/polar_meteorology/methane/ |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent advances now allow sensors to directly measure turbulent methane fluxes from naturally emitting surfaces. A fast response methane sensor can also be installed in research aircraft, like the Polar 5 airplane of the [[Alfred Wegener Institute]].

'''Powered speakers''', also known as '''self-powered speakers''' and '''active speakers''', are [[loudspeaker]]s that have built-in [[amplifier]]s. Powered speakers are used in a range of settings, including in [[sound reinforcement system]]s (used at live music concerts), both for the main speakers facing the audience and the [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor speakers]] facing the performers; by [[DJ]]s performing at dance events and [[rave]]s; in private homes as part of [[hi-fi]] or [[home cinema]] audio systems and as [[computer speaker]]s. They can be connected directly to a [[mixing console]] or other low-level [[audio signal]] source without the need for an external amplifier. Some active speakers designed for sound reinforcement system use have an onboard [[mixing console]] and [[microphone preamplifier]], which enables microphones to be connected directly to the speaker. 

Active speakers have several advantages, the most obvious being their compactness and simplicity. Additionally the amplifier(s) can be designed to closely match the optimal requirements of the speaker it will power; and the speaker designer is not required to include a passive crossover, decreasing production cost and possibly sound quality. Some also claim that the shorter distances between components can decrease external interference and increase fidelity; although this is highly dubious, and the reciprocal argument can also be made. Disadvantages include heavier [[loudspeaker enclosure]]s; reduced reliability due to active electronic components within; and the need to supply both the audio signal and power to every unit separately, typically requiring two cables to be run to each speaker (as opposed to the single cable required with passive speakers and an external amplifier).

Powered speakers are available with passive or active [[audio crossover|crossovers]] built into them. Since the early 2000s, powered speakers with active crossovers and other DSP have become common in [[Sound reinforcement system|sound reinforcement]] applications and in [[studio monitor]]s.&lt;ref name=Kuells2001&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.livesoundint.com/archives/2001/septoct/active/active.php |title=Amped Up: Active Speaker Designs: Less Cost for a Total System? |last=Kuells |first=Jeff |date=September–October 2001 |work=Live Sound International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Home theater and add-on domestic/automotive [[subwoofer]]s have used active powered speaker technology since the late 1980s.

== Differences ==
[[File:AppleDesign Powered Speakers (M6082) back.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A powered computer speaker.]]
The terms "powered" and "active" have been used interchangeably in loudspeaker designs, however, a differentiation may be made between the terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec03/articles/qanda.htm#1 |title=Questions &amp; Answers |last=Robjohns |first=Hugh |work=Sound On Sound |date=December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In a passive loudspeaker system the low-level audio signal is first amplified by an external power amplifier before being sent to the loudspeaker where the signal is split by a passive crossover into the appropriate frequency ranges before being sent to the individual drivers. This design is common in [[home audio]] as well as professional concert audio.
*A powered loudspeaker works the same way as a passive speaker, but the power amplifier is built into the loudspeaker enclosure. This design is common in compact personal speakers such as those used to amplify portable digital music devices.
*In a fully active loudspeaker system each driver has its own dedicated power amplifier. The low-level audio signal is first sent through an active crossover to split the audio signal into the appropriate frequency ranges before being sent to the power amplifiers and then on to the drivers. This design is commonly seen in studio monitors and professional concert audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QjxMkx_w1wC&amp;pg=PA70 |page=70 |title=An Introduction to Music Technology |last=Hosken |first=Dan |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2010 |isbn=0-415-87827-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RDfKSh3Q8kAC&amp;pg=PA718 |page=718 |title=Audio Engineering: Know It All |last1=Self |first1=Douglas |last2=Sinclair |first2=Ian |last3=Duncan |first3=Ben |publisher=Newnes |year=2008 |isbn=1-85617-526-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrid active designs exist such as having three drivers powered by two internal amplifiers. In this case, an active two-way crossover splits the audio signal, usually into low frequencies and mid-high frequencies. The low-frequency driver is driven by its own amplifier channel while the mid- and high-frequency drivers share an amplifier channel, the output of which is split by a passive two-way crossover.

===Integrated active systems===
The term "active speakers" can also refer to an integrated "active system"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tnt-audio.com/casse/active_speakers_intro1_e.html |title=Sounding passive? Get active! – Part I |publisher=TNT-Audio (online) |last=Wheeler |first=Mark |date=March–June 2006 |issn=1825-4853 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which passive loudspeakers are mated to an external system of multiple amplifiers fed by an active crossover. These active loudspeaker systems may be built for professional concert touring such as the pioneering JM-3 system designed in 1971 by [[McCune Audio/Video/Lighting|Harry McCune Sound Service]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prosoundweb.com/chat_psw/transcripts/jmeyer.shtml Transcript PSW LIVE CHAT with John Meyer]&lt;/ref&gt; or they may be built for [[High-end audio|high-end home use]] such as various systems from [[Naim Audio]] and [[Linn Products]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tnt-audio.com/casse/active_speakers_intro1_e.html |title=Sounding passive? Get active! – Part II |publisher=TNT-Audio (online) |last=Wheeler |first=Mark |date=March–June 2006 |issn=1825-4853 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Some of the first powered loudspeakers were [[JBL]] monitor speakers.  With the addition of the SE401 Stereo Energizer, introduced in 1964, any pair of monitor speakers could be converted to self-powered operation with the second speaker powered by the first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lansingheritage.org/images/jbl/catalogs/1964/page43.jpg JBL Solid State Stereo Energizer]&lt;/ref&gt; The first studio monitor with an active crossover was the OY invented 1967 by Klein-Hummel. It was a hybrid three-way design with two internal amplifier channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sennheiser.com/klein-hummel/icm_en.nsf/root/prof-monitoring_discontinued-monitors_OY |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090612135859/http://www.sennheiser.com/klein-hummel/icm_en.nsf/root/prof-monitoring_discontinued-monitors_OY |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 12, 2009 |title=OY – Control Monitor |work=Klein + Hummel |publisher=Sennheiser |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early example of a bi-amplified powered studio monitor is the Altec 9846B, introduced in 1971, which combined the passive 9846-8A speaker with the new 771B Bi-amplifier with 60 watts for the [[woofer]] and 30 watts for the high frequency [[compression driver]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lansingheritage.org/images/altec/catalogs/1971-monitor/page6.jpg Altec 1971 Monitor catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s, [[Paramount Pictures]] contracted with AB Systems to design a powered speaker system.&lt;ref name=Kuells2001/&gt;

In 1980, [[Meyer Sound Laboratories]] produced an integrated active 2-way system, the passive UPA-1, which incorporated lessons [[John Meyer (audio engineer)|John Meyer]] learned on the McCune JM-3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/launch.aspx?referral=other&amp;pnum=44&amp;refresh=g06DXd131L4x&amp;EID=d85639f5-d173-4f3e-8889-c046966f2662&amp;skip=&amp;p=44 |title=Classic Gear: The Meyer UPA-1 |work=Lighting &amp; Sound |date=May 2009 |page=44 |last=Halliday |first=Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used active electronics mounted outside of the loudspeaker enclosure, including Meyer's integrated active crossover with feedback comparator circuits determining the level of limiting, often connected to third-party customer-specified amplifiers. In 1990, Meyer produced its first powered speaker: the HD-1, a 2-way studio monitor with all internal electronics.&lt;ref name=Kuells2001/&gt; In the early '90s, after years of dealing with the disadvantages of passive systems, especially varying gain settings on third-party amplifiers, John Meyer decided to stop making passive speakers and devote his company to active designs. Meyer said he "hired an ad agency to research how people felt about powered speakers for sound reinforcement, and they came back after a survey and said that nobody wanted them."&lt;ref name=MeyerPowered&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meyersound.com/about/our_story/pioneering_self-powered/ |title=Pioneering Self-Powered Loudspeakers for Over 11 Years |publisher=Meyer Sound Laboratories |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224031916/http://www.meyersound.com/about/our_story/pioneering_self-powered/ |archivedate=December 24, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sound reinforcement system]] operators said they did not want loudspeakers in which they could not see the amplifier meters to determine whether the loudspeakers were working properly during a concert. Nevertheless, Meyer kept to his decision and produced the MSL-4 in 1994, the first powered loudspeaker intended for concert touring.&lt;ref name=MeyerPowered/&gt; The UPA-1 was converted to a self-powered configuration in 1996 and the rest of Meyer's product line followed suit.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Fidelity===
The main benefit of active versus passive speakers is in the higher fidelity associated with active crossovers and multiple amplifiers, including less IMD, higher dynamic range and greater output power.&lt;ref name="Duncan1996"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ma7qKuwH-nIC&amp;pg=PA31|title=High performance audio power amplifiers|last=Duncan|first=Ben|publisher=Newnes|year=1996|isbn=0-7506-2629-1|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amplifiers within the loudspeaker enclosure may be ideally matched to the individual drivers, eliminating the need for each amplifier channel to operate in the entire audio bandpass. Driver characteristics such as power handling and impedance may be matched to amplifier capabilities.&lt;ref name=Kuells2001/&gt; More specifically, active speakers have very short [[speaker cable]]s inside the enclosure, so very little voltage and control is lost in long speaker cables with higher resistance.

An active speaker often incorporates equalization tailored to each driver's response in the enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/volume_9_4/feature-article-active-speakers-12-2002.html |title=The Benefits of an Active Speaker Lifestyle |date=December 2002 |last=Miller |first=Colin |work=Secrets of Home Theater and High Fidelity |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This yields a flatter, more neutral sound. Limiting circuits (high-ratio [[Dynamic range compression|audio compression]] circuits) can be incorporated to increase the likelihood of the driver surviving high-SPL use. Such limiters may be carefully matched to driver characteristics, resulting in a more dependable loudspeaker requiring less service. Distortion detection may be designed into the electronics to help determine the onset of protective limiting, reducing output distortion and eliminating [[Clipping (audio)|clipping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9B2kgjxl4cC&amp;pg=PA31 |pages=31–32 |title=Sound systems: design and optimization: modern techniques and tools for sound system design and alignment |last=McCarthy |first=Bob |publisher=Focal Press |year=2007 |isbn=0-240-52020-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cabling===
Passive speakers need only one speaker cable but active speakers need two cables: an audio signal cable and an AC power cable. For multiple-enclosure high-power concert systems, the AC cabling is often smaller in diameter than the equivalent speaker cable bundles, so less copper is used. Some powered speaker manufacturers are now incorporating UHF or more frequently [[Wi-Fi]] wireless receivers so the speaker requires only an AC power cable.

===Weight===
A powered speaker usually weighs more than an equivalent passive speaker because the internal amplifier circuitry usually outweighs a speaker-level passive crossover. A loudspeaker associated with an integrated active system is even lighter because it has no internal crossover. A lightweight loudspeaker can be more easily carried and it is less of a load in rigging (flying). However, active speakers using lightweight [[Class-D amplifier]]s have narrowed the difference. Trucking for a sound system involves transporting all of the various components including amplifier racks, speaker cabling and loudspeaker enclosures. Overall shipping weight for an active loudspeaker system may be less than for a passive system because heavy passive speaker cable bundles are replaced by lighter AC cables and small diameter signal cables. Truck space and weight is reduced by eliminating amplifier racks.&lt;ref name=Kuells2001/&gt;

===Cost===
The expense of a large concert active speaker system is less than the expense of an equivalent passive system.&lt;ref name=Kuells2001/&gt; The passive system, or integrated active system with external electronics, requires separate components such as crossovers, equalizers, limiters and amplifiers, all mounted in rolling racks. Cabling for passive concert systems is heavy, large-diameter speaker cable, more expensive than smaller diameter AC power cables and much smaller audio signal cables. For high-end home use, active speakers usually cost more than passive speakers because of the additional amplifier channels required.&lt;ref name=Duncan1996/&gt;

===Ease of use===
In professional audio and some home cinema and hi-fi applications, the active speaker may be easier to use because it eliminates the complexity of properly setting crossover frequencies, equalizer curves and limiter thresholds. Cabling is not as simple, however, because active speakers require two cables instead of one (an AC power cable and a cable with the signal, typically an [[XLR connector|XLR]] cable). In home audio, some audio engineers argue that a passive speaker, in which an unpowered speaker is connected to an amplifier, is the easiest to install and operate.

==Servo-driven speakers==
By including a [[negative feedback]] loop in the amplifier-speaker system, distortion can be substantially reduced. If mounted at the speaker cone, the sensor is usually an accelerometer. It is possible to monitor the back [[Electromotive force|emf]] generated by the driver voice coil as it moves within the magnetic gap. In either case, specialist amplifier designs are needed and so servo speakers are inherently powered speakers.

==Bass amplifiers==
Some [[bass amplifier]] manufacturers sell powered speakers designed for adding to the stage power of a combo bass amp. The user plugs a patch cord or XLR cable from the combo amp into the powered speaker.

The rules and regulations concerning '''prisoners of war in Islam''' are covered in manuals of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]],  based upon [[Islam]]ic teachings, in both the [[Qur'an]] and [[hadith]].

The historical legal principles governing the treatment of [[prisoners of war]], in [[shar'iah]], Islamic law, (in the traditional [[madhabs]] schools of Islamic jurisprudence), was then a significant improvement{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} over the pre-existing norms of society during [[Muhammad]]'s time (see [[Early reforms under Islam]]). Men, women, and children may all be taken as prisoners of war under traditional interpretations of Islamic law. Generally, a prisoner of war could be, at the discretion of the military leader, freed, ransomed, exchanged for Muslim prisoners, or kept in bondage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tafsir]] of the [[Qur'an]] by [[Ibn Kathir]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20050115105038/http://users.mo-net.com/mcruzan/pows_02.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahkaam al-Sijn wa’l-Sujana’ wa Mu’aamalat al-Sujana’ fi’l-Islam of the [[Hadith]] by Hasan Abi’l-Ghuddah [http://islamqa.info/en/ref/13241]&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier times, the ransom sometimes took an educational dimension, where a literate prisoner of war could secure his or her freedom by teaching ten Muslims to read and write.&lt;ref&gt;Shirazi, Imam Muhammad. ''The Prophet Muhammad - A Mercy to the World''. Createspace Independent Pub, 2013, p. 74.{{self-published inline|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslim scholars hold that a prisoner may not be ransomed for gold or silver, but may be exchanged for Muslim prisoners.&lt;ref name="AbuYusuf"&gt;'Abu Yusuf Ya'qub Le Livre de l'impot foncier,' translated from Arabic and annotated by Edmond Fagnan, Paris, Paul Geuthner, 1991, pages 301-302) Abu Yusuf (d. 798 CE)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During his life, Muhammad made it the responsibility of the Islamic government to provide food and clothing, on a reasonable basis, to captives, regardless of their religion.{{additional citation|date=June 2017}} If the prisoners were in the custody of a person, then the responsibility was on the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Maududi (1967), ''Introduction of Ad-Dahr'', "Period of revelation", p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation|date=June 2017}}

Historically, Muslims routinely captured large number of prisoners. Aside from those who converted to Islam, most were ransomed or enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;(Crone (2004), pp. 371-72)&lt;/ref&gt; Pasquier writes,
{{quote|It was the custom to enslave prisoners of war and the Islamic state would have put itself at a grave disadvantage vis-a-vis its enemies had it not reciprocated to some extent. By guaranteeing them [male POWs] humane treatment, and various possibilities of subsequently releasing themselves, it ensured that a good number of combatants in the opposing armies preferred captivity at the hands of Muslims to death on the field of battle.&lt;ref&gt;Roger DuPasquier. Unveiling Islam. Islamic Texts Society, 1992, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to accounts written by [[Muhammad]]'s followers, after the [[Battle of Badr]], some prisoners were executed for their earlier crimes in Mecca,{{additional citation|date=June 2017}} but the rest were given options: They could convert to Islam and thus win their freedom; they could pay ransom and win their freedom; they could teach 10 Muslims to read and write and thus win their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-islam.org/lifeprophet/14.htm The Life of Muhammad The Prophet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During his rule, [[Caliph]] [[Umar]] made it illegal to separate related prisoners of war from each other, after a captive complained to him for being separated from her daughter.&lt;ref name="Naqvi"&gt;Naqvi (2000), pg. 456&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation|date=June 2017}}

These principles were also honoured during the [[Crusades]], as exemplified by sultans such as [[Saladin]]{{additional citation|date=June 2017}} and [[al-Kamil]]. For example, after al-Kamil defeated the [[Franks]] during the [[Crusades]], Oliverus Scholasticus praised the Islamic [[laws of war]], commenting on how al-Kamil supplied the defeated Frankish army with food:&lt;ref name=Weeramantry&gt;{{Cite book|title=Justice Without Frontiers|first=Christopher G.|last=Judge Weeramantry |year=1997 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |isbn=90-411-0241-8 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation|date=June 2017}}

{{quote|Who could doubt that such goodness, friendship and charity come from God? Men whose parents, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, had died in agony at our hands, whose lands we took, whom we drove naked from their homes, revived us with their own food when we were dying of hunger and showered us with kindness even when we were in their power."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Justice Without Frontiers |first=Christopher G. |last=Judge Weeramantry |year=1997 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |isbn=90-411-0241-8|pages=136–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Treatment of prisoners==
Upon capture, the prisoners must be guarded and not ill-treated.&lt;ref name = Nigosian&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Nigosian
  | first = S. A.
  | title = Islam. Its History, Teaching, and Practices

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic law holds that the prisoners must be fed and clothed, either by the Islamic government or by the individual who has custody of the prisoner. This position is supported by the verse {{quran-usc-range|76|8}} of the [[Quran]]. The prisoners must be fed in a dignified manner, and must not be forced to beg for their subsistence.&lt;ref&gt;Maududi (1967), introduction of [[Ad-Dahr]], "Period of revelation", pg. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad's early followers also considered it a principle to not separate prisoners from their relatives.&lt;ref name="Naqvi" /&gt;

After the fighting is over, prisoners are to be released, with some prospect of survival, or ransomed. The freeing or ransoming of prisoners by Muslims themselves is highly recommended as a charitable act.&lt;ref name = Nigosian/&gt; The Qur'an also urges kindness to captives&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|4|36}}, {{Quran-usc|9|60}}, {{Quran-usc|24|58}})&lt;/ref&gt; and recommends, their liberation by purchase or [[manumission]]. The freeing of captives is recommended both for the expiation of sins&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|4|92}}, {{Quran-usc|5|92}}, {{Quran-usc|58|3}})&lt;/ref&gt; and as an act of simple benevolence.&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|2|177}}, {{Quran-usc|24|33}}, {{Quran-usc|90|13}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 6. All Qur'anic citations are his.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women and children===
Some Muslim scholars claim that women and children prisoners of war cannot be killed under any circumstances, regardless of their faith,&lt;ref&gt;(Patricia Crone. God’s Rule: Government and Islam. New York: Columbia University Press, 2004, pp. 371-72)&lt;/ref&gt; but that they may be enslaved, freed or ransomed.

One traditional opinion holds that executing prisoners of war is strictly forbidden; this is the most-widely accepted view, and one upheld by the [[Hanafi]] [[madh'hab|madhab]].&lt;ref name="ElFadl"&gt;El Fadl (2003), pg. 115&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2017}}

However, the opinion of the [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] and [[Jafari]] madhabs is that adult male prisoners of war may be executed.&lt;ref&gt;El Fadl (2003), pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The decision for an execution is to be made by the Muslim leader. This opinion was also upheld by the Muslim judge, [[Sa'id bin Jubair]] (665-714 AD) and [[Abu Yusuf]], a classical jurist from the [[Hanafi]] school of jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="AbuYusuf" /&gt; El Fadl argues the reason Muslim jurists adopted this position was largely because it was consistent with the war practices of the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="ElFadl" /&gt; [[Muhammad Hamidullah]], while reminding that execution in such cases was exceptional and depending on many factors, further precises that [[beheading]] was discouraged: "[[ijma|unanimity]] was reached among the [[Sahaba|Companions]] of the Prophet not to behead prisoners of war. In short, capital punishment for prisoners of war is only permissible in extreme cases of necessity and in the higher interests of the State."&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Hamidullah, ''Muslim Conduct of State'', Muhammad Ashraf (1945), pp. 208-209&lt;/ref&gt;

Most contemporary Muslim scholars prohibit altogether the killing of prisoners and hold that this was the policy practiced by [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;Hashmi (2003), pg. 145&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2017}} The 20th-century Muslim scholar, [[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]] states that no prisoner should be "put to the sword" in accordance with a [[hadith|saying]]{{which|date=June 2017}} of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="Maududi 1998, p. 34"&gt;Maududi (1998), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]], another 20th-century [[Muslim]] scholar, while commenting on verse {{Quran-usc|9|6}}, writes,

{{quote|Even those the [[Persecution of Muslims|enemies of Islam]], actively fighting against Islam, there may be individuals who may be in a position to require protection. Full asylum is to be given to them, and opportunities provided for hearing the Word of Allah...If they do not see their way to accept Islam, they will require double protection: (1) from the Islamic forces openly fighting against their people, and (2) from their own people, as they detached themselves from them. Both kinds of protection should be ensured for them, and they should be safely escorted to a place where they can be safe.&lt;ref&gt;Ali (1991), p. 498&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Maududi further states that Islam forbids torturing, especially by fire, and quotes Muhammad as saying, "Punishment by fire does not behoove anyone except the Master of the Fire [God]."&lt;ref name="Maududi 1998, p. 34"/&gt;

Quoting from the sources, Muhammad Munir, from the Department of Law  of the [[International Islamic University, Islamabad|International Islamic University]], [[Pakistan]], says that early religious authorities standing against the execution of POWs ''at all'' include [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|'Ali b. Abi Tãlib]], [[Hasan of Basra|Al-Hasan b. al-Hasan al-Basrl]]  (d. 110/728), [[Hammad ibn Salamah|Hammãd b. Abi Sulaymän]] (d. 120/737), [[Ibn Sirin|Muhammad b. Sirin]]  (d. 110/728), [[Mujahid ibn Jabr|Mujãhid b. Jabr]] (d. 103/721),  [[Ibn Jurayj|'Abd al-Mãlik b. 'Abd al-'Azïz b. Jurayj]] (d. 150/767), [[Ata ibn Abi Rabah|'Atâ' b. Abi Rabãh]]  (d. 114/732) and Abû  'Ubayd  ibn Sallãm,&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Munir, "Debates on the Rights of Prisoners of War in Islamic Law" in ''Islamic Studies'',  Vol. 49, No. 4 (Winter 2010), p. 469&lt;/ref&gt; while later scholars favouring the same opinion include [[Qurtubi|Muhammad b. Ahmad al-Qurtubl]] (d. 671/1272), who shares {{Quran-usc|47|4}} to vindicate the sheer impossibility of execution if we follow the letter of the Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Munir, "Debates on the Rights of Prisoners of War in Islamic Law" in ''Islamic Studies'',  Vol. 49, No. 4 (Winter 2010), p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Rushd]] (d. 594/1198)  is also quoted: "[A] number of jurists did not permit executing the prisoners  of war. Al-Hasan b. Muhammad al-Tamïmï (d. 656/1258) stated consensus ([[ijma]]) of the [[Sahaba|Companions]] on this view."&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Munir, "Debates on the Rights of Prisoners of War in Islamic Law" in ''Islamic Studies'',  Vol. 49, No. 4 (Winter 2010), p. 470&lt;/ref&gt; He further shows that the rare executions were more due to the crimes they committed before the captivity than their status of POW itself. A famous case being  [[Abdullah ibn Khatal|'Abd Allah b. Khatal]]. One of the few persons who weren't granted immunity at the [[conquest of Mecca]]. A group of people which "could have been punished by  a tribunal should there have been one at the time”. But he was the only one executed for what we would today call [[high treason]] (as he collected tax money from Muslims before defecting and fighting them).&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Munir, "Debates on the Rights of Prisoners of War in Islamic Law" in ''Islamic Studies'',  Vol. 49, No. 4 (Winter 2010), p. 472&lt;/ref&gt; More generically, he also shows that "in the first one hundred years of Islamic military history, that is, from the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) till the time of Caliph [[Umar II|'Umar b. 'Abdul 'Aziz]], there were only six or seven such cases, even if we were to accept the spurious reports of such executions."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2810">In [[mathematics]] and [[computing]], a '''[[radix]] point''' (or '''radix character''') is the symbol used in numerical representations to separate the [[integer]] part of a number (to the left of the radix point) from its [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] part (to the right of the radix point).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Essential Mathematics for Games and Interactive Applications: A Programmer's Guide|first1=James M.|last1=Van Verth|first2=Lars M.|last2=Bishop|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=2008|isbn=9780123742971|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zkEY9RIm4WkC&amp;pg=PA7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Radix point" applies to all [[radix|number base]]s. In [[decimal|base 10]] notation, the radix point is more commonly called the [[decimal point]], where the prefix [[wikt:deci-|deci-]] implies base 10.  Similarly, the term "binary point" is used for [[binary numeral system|base 2]].

In [[List of countries where English is an official language|English-speaking countries]], the radix point is usually a small dot (.) placed either on the baseline or halfway between the baseline and the top of the [[Numeral system|numerals]]. In many other countries, the radix point is a comma (,) placed on the baseline. It is important to know which notation is being used when working in different software programs. The respective [[ISO 31-0#Numbers|ISO standard]] defines both the comma and the small dot as decimal markers, but does not explicitly define universal radix marks for bases other than 10.

==Examples== 
* In base 10 (decimal):  13.625
: In this example, 13 is the integer to the left of the radix point, and 625 (i.e. 625/1000) is the fractional part to the right.

* In base 2 (binary): 1101.101
: The binary number 1101.101 has the following digits:
{| class="wikitable" style="width:50%;table-layout:fixed;text-align:center;"
|-
! width="125pt;"|Power of 2
| 3 || 2 || 1 || 0 || || −1 || −2 || −3
|-
! Binary digit
| 1 || 1 || 0 || 1 || '''.''' || 1 || 0 || 1
|}

Hence, its decimal value can be calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
1101.101_2
&amp;= 1 \times 2^3 + 1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 + 1 \times 2^{-1} + 0 \times 2^{-2} + 1 \times 2^{-3} \\
&amp;= 1 \times 8 + 1 \times 4 + 0 \times 2 + 1 \times 1 + 1 \times 0.5 + 0 \times 0.25 + 1 \times 0.125 \\
&amp;= 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0.5 + 0 + 0.125 \\
&amp;= 13.625_{10}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

It is now seen that 1101, which is to the left of the radix point, is the binary representation of the decimal number 13.  To the right of the radix point is 101, which is the binary representation of the decimal fraction 625/1000 (or 5/8).

The '''Rift Valley Institute''' (RVI) is an independent, non-profit research and training organisation working with communities and institutions in Eastern Africa, including [[Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], the [[Horn of Africa]], and the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] region. Established in 2001, the RVI has offices in Kenya, the US and the UK.

==Local knowledge, global information==
The aim of the Institute is to bring local knowledge to bear on global information systems, advancing education, combating institutional amnesia, and modifying development practice.

==Action-oriented social research and advocacy==
The RVI’s core activities can be summed up as action-oriented education: field research and the dissemination of knowledge about Eastern Africa, within the region and beyond. The RVI’s research projects are designed to record and preserve indigenous culture, support local research capacity, promote human rights and inform global advocacy efforts.

==Annual RVI courses==
The RVI works with educational institutions across the region and runs several in-country training courses. In the summer of 2012, there were three primary courses, covering Sudan/South Sudan, the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes. Each featured an intensive, week-long syllabus and was taught by both internationally recognized scholars and local experts. RVI courses emphasise the practical application of academic and technical knowledge to politics and development for local and expatriate aid workers, diplomats, peace-keepers, researchers and business people. An enlarged course schedule for 2013 will be announced in December 2012.

==A knowledge network==
The Institute maintains an expanding open-access digital library, the [[Sudan Open Archive]], available online and on disk, comprising historical and contemporary books, documents and audio-visual media. The RVI's own website features free-to-download digital editions of the Institute's reports and publications, including The Sudan Handbook (2011), an authoritative introduction written by leading Sudanese, South Sudanese and international specialists.

==Senior staff, Fellows &amp; Associates==
The RVI's Executive Director is Professor [[John Ryle (writer)|John Ryle]], who founded the Institute with [[Jok Madut Jok]] and [[Philip Winter]]. Fellows of the Institute, drawn from the region and beyond, are practitioners and academic specialists in the fields of human rights, history, anthropology, political science, economics, development, media, and law.

==Funders==
The RVI has received financial support from organisations including the [[Open Society Institute]], the J.M. Kaplan Fund, the Sigrid Rausing Trust, the [[United States Institute of Peace]], [[UNICEF]], [[UNEP]], and the UK Government [[Department for International Development]] (DFID). It has received donations from Small Voice (UK) and [[Times Newspapers]] and technical support from Compactive Digital Services (Budapest) and Halcrow Ltd (London).

==Partners==
The Institute works in collaboration with other organisations in the region and beyond. These include the University of Juba, Sudan, the Southern Sudan Commission for Census, Statistics and Evaluation, the [[International Rescue Committee]], the Bahr-el-Ghazal Youth Association, [[Save The Children Fund]] (UK), [[Bard College]] (New York), the [[Royal African Society]], the [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]], the British Institute in Eastern Africa, Rumbek Senior Secondary School; the Shading Tree; the [[World Bank]]; and the [[Poetry Translation Centre]] at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.

As they are lateral extensions of a single cell and only rarely branched, they are visible to the naked eye and light microscope. They are found only in the region of maturation of the root. Just prior to, and during, root hair cell development, there is elevated [[phosphorylase]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Dosier|first1=Larry W.|last2=Riopel|first2=J.

==Function==
The root hairs are where most water absorption happens. They are long and so they can penetrate between soil particles, and prevent harmful bacterial organisms from entering the plant through the xylem vessels. They have a large surface area for absorption of water. Increasing root surface area aids plants to be more efficient in absorbing nutrients and establishing relationships with microbes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3243358/|title=Root Hairs|journal=The Arabidopsis Book|volume=1|pages=e0060|pmc=3243358|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|doi=10.1199/tab.0060|pmid=22303213|year=2002|last1=Grierson|first1=C.|last2=Schiefelbein|first2=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cross-section of root hair cell: a roughly rectangular shape with a long, thin tail extending to the right and a nucleus at the top left.
Water passes from the soil water to the root hair cell’s cytoplasm by osmosis. This happens because the soil water has a higher water potential than the root hair cell cytoplasm. The function of root hairs is to collect water and mineral [[nutrient]]s present in the soil and take this solution up through the roots to the rest of the plant. As root hair cells do not carry out [[photosynthesis]] they do not contain [[chloroplasts]].

==Formation==
Root hair cells are outgrowths at a tip of the plant's roots. Root hair cells vary between 15 and 17 micrometres in diameter, and 80 to 1,500 micrometres in length.&lt;ref&gt;Dittmar, cited in Esau, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; They are found only in the zone of maturation, and not the zone of elongation, possibly because any root hairs that arise are sheared off as the root elongates and moves through the soil. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
Root hairs grow quickly, at least 1μm/min, making them particularly useful for research on cell expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Grierson|first1=Claire|last2=Schiefelbein|first2=John|title=Root Hairs|journal=The Arabidopsis Book|volume=1|pages=e0060|doi=10.1199/tab.0060|pmid=22303213|pmc=3243358|date=1 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
Root hairs form an important surface as they are needed to [[Absorption of water|absorb]] most of the water and nutrients needed for the plant.
They are also directly involved in the formation of root nodules in [[Fabaceae|legume]] plants. The root hairs curl around the bacteria which allows for the formation of an infection thread through into the dividing cortical cells to form the nodule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mergaert|first1=Peter|last2=Uchiumi|first2=Toshiki|last3=Alunni|first3=Benoît|last4=Evanno|first4=Gwénaëlle|last5=Cheron|first5=Angélique|last6=Catrice|first6=Olivier|last7=Mausset|first7=Anne-Elisabeth|last8=Barloy-Hubler|first8=Frédérique|last9=Galibert|first9=Francis|last10=Kondorosi|first10=Adam|last11=Kondorosi|first11=Eva|title=Eukaryotic control on bacterial cell cycle and differentiation in the Rhizobium–legume symbiosis|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/103/13/5230|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=103|issue=13|accessdate=23 April 2018|pages=5230–5235|language=en|doi=10.1073/pnas.0600912103|pmid=16547129|pmc=1458823|date=28 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having a large surface area, the [[active uptake]] of water and minerals through root hairs is highly efficient. 
Root hair cells also secrete acid (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from [[malic acid]]) which exchanges and helps solubilize the minerals into ionic form, making the ions easier to absorb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Gerke|first1=Jörg|last2=Römer|first2=Wilhelm|last3=Jungk|first3=Albrecht|title=The excretion of citric and malic acid by proteoid roots ofLupinus albus L.; effects on soil solution concentrations of phosphate, iron, and aluminum in the proteoid rhizosphere in samples of an oxisol and a luvisol|journal=Zeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde|volume=157|issue=4|pages=289–294|language=en|doi=10.1002/jpln.19941570408|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Survival==
Root hair cells can survive for 2 to 3 weeks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/4piuz-b_6dgs/root-hair-cells/|title=Root hair cells|website=prezi.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then die off, at the same time new root hair cells are continually being formed at the tip of the root. This way, the root hair coverage stays the same. When a new root hair cell grows, it excretes a poison so that the other cells in close proximity to it are unable to grow one of these hairs. This ensures equal and efficient distribution of the actual hairs on these cells. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The act of re-potting or transplanting a plant can result in root hair cells being pulled off, perhaps to a significant extent, and such plants may therefore wilt for some time as a result.

[[File:Baiyun, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China - panoramio (33).jpg|thumb|An urban fringe village located in [[Baiyun District, Guangzhou]], China.]]

The '''rural–urban fringe''', also known as the '''outskirts''', '''rurban''', '''peri-urban'''  or the '''urban hinterland''', can be described as the "'''landscape interface''' between town and country",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.cfm?Articleid=2803 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311091656/http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.cfm?Articleid=2803 |date=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or also as the transition zone where urban and rural uses mix and often clash.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Michael. B., Flemming Christiansen, and Malcolm Chapman. (2010) 'Chinese Consumers: The porn Reappraisal'. ''Ethnography'', Sept 2010, 11, 331-357&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it can be viewed as a landscape type in its own right, one forged from an interaction of urban and rural land uses.

== Definition ==

Its definition shifts depending on the global location, but typically in Europe, where urban areas are intensively managed to prevent [[urban sprawl]] and protect agricultural land, the urban fringe will be characterised by certain land uses which have either purposely moved away from the urban area, or require much larger tracts of land. As examples:

* Roads, especially motorways and bypasses
* Waste transfer stations, [[recycling]] facilities and landfill sites
* [[Park and ride]] sites
* Airports
* Large hospitals
* Power, water and sewerage facilities
* Factories
* Large out-of-town shopping facilities, e.g. large supermarkets

Despite these 'urban' uses, the fringe remains largely open, with the majority of the land agricultural, woodland or other rural use. However, the quality of the countryside around urban areas tends to be low, with severance between the area of open land and bad maintained woodlands and hedgerows.

In recent years there has been a growing interest in how the full environmental and social potential of the urban fringe can be unlocked. In England in 2005, the Countryside Agency (now part of [[Natural England]]) together with Groundwork, a community and environmental regeneration body, produced a vision for the 'countryside in and around towns' that sets out ten 'functions' for a multi-functional urban fringe.&lt;ref&gt;http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/file/105001  Green Infrastructure
and the Urban Fringe: Learning lessons from the Countryside in and Around Towns Programme (Countryside Agency and Groundwork UK, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The realisation of this vision would{{Dubious|date=February 2010}} provide a high-quality environment right on the urban doorstep and provide the adjacent town or city with a host of '[[ecosystem services]]'. It is estimated{{By whom|date=February 2010}} that within England the urban fringe covers as much as 20% of the land area. Such an extensive resource must be managed and used more intelligently and sustainably if the country as a whole is to develop and function sustainably.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In the [[United States]] urban areas are defined as contiguous territory having a density of at least 1,000 persons per square mile, though in some areas the density may be as low as 500 per square mile. Urban areas also include the outlying territory of less density if it was connected to the core of the contiguous area by road and is within 2.5 road miles of that core, or within 5 road miles of the core but separated by water or other undevelopable territories. Other territory with a population density of fewer than 1,000 people per square mile is included in the urban fringe if it eliminates an enclave or closes an indentation in the boundary of the urbanized area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/fedreg/fedregv76n164.pdf| title=Urban Area Criteria for the 2010 Census; Notice| author=Department of Commerce - Census Bureau| work=Federal Register| publisher=National Archives and Records Administration| date=August 24, 2011| access-date=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SIT Study Abroad''' is a university-level [[Study abroad organization|study abroad program]] administered by [[World Learning]], a [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3) international non-profit organization]] based in [[Brattleboro, Vermont]], [[United States]]. Like its sister-program the [[SIT Graduate Institute]], the program is accredited by the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] through its Commission on Institutions of Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cihe.neasc.org/about_our_institutions/roster_of_institutions/ NEASC Roster of Accredited Institutions.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828132004/http://cihe.neasc.org/about_our_institutions/roster_of_institutions/ |date=2013-08-28 }} Accessed: May 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gooverseas.com/sit-study-abroad-reviews GoOverseas.com SIT Study Abroad Reviews.] Accessed May 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

SIT Study Abroad offers semester and summer-long thematic programs in over 40 countries around the world.  More than 25,000 students have studied abroad with SIT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/thebrownandwhiteblog/index.ssf/2012/03/the_sit_study_abroad_expereinc.html “Students Lectured on SIT Study Abroad Experience,” The Brown &amp; White Blog.] Accessed May 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; All programs are run by Academic Directors who are residents of the host country and experts in the specific academic subject area of the program. Programs incorporate classroom-based and field-based learning as well as an [[independent study|independent study project]] component. Students live in [[homestay]]s, are involved in host community cultural activities and participate in excursions.  All programs study a particular global issue such as health, ecology, conflict transformation, or development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/osuabroad/2011/03/15/study-abroad-with-sit/ OSU Abroad Blog.] Accessed: May 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegenews.com/article/the_advantages_of_field_based_study_abroad_with_sit “Advantages of Field-Based Study Abroad,” CollegeNews.com.] Accessed May 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
SIT Study Abroad’s academic programs use a field-based, experimental approach. Students complete undergraduate research through an Independent Study Project, the content of which is supervised by their advisors. The students have access to SIT’s local resources and networks during their stay, including a small group of their peers that participate in each program. The foundation of SIT’s educational philosophy holds a strong commitment to reciprocity that is fostered through the students experience abroad.

Students may elect to participate in an International Honors Program (IHP). This type of program involves studying in multiple destinations while exploring social justice and sustainability which can offer a more cross-cultural educational experience. IHP and SIT Study Abroad have long shared a profound and defining commitment to intercultural communication, social justice, and experiential learning. IHP’s partnership with SIT Study Abroad and World Learning dates back to 2007, when SIT became IHP’s official school of record. The integration between the two partners deepened in the 2011-2012 academic year, when IHP was first included in SIT Study Abroad’s portfolio of programs. Building on a distinguished 50-plus-year history, IHP comparative programs continue to challenge students to ask new and better questions about their lifelong roles in a global community. Comparative programs offer students the opportunity to investigate significant global issues in at least three countries. Some topics include: Cities in the 21st Century, Climate Change, The Politics of Food, Health and Community, and Human Rights.

==Programs==
SIT has many programs in countries all over the world with a particular focus in developing nations. Each program is designed around a different theme that is relative to the country the student will study in. The website has a full list of current programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studyabroad.sit.edu/programs/ "SIT Study Abroad programs"] Accessed March 3, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

For more than fifty years, SIT has provided carefully designed and thoughtfully facilitated study abroad programs rooted in the experiential education learning model. This model, as popularized by David Kolb, guides students through an intentional approach to structured and unstructured experiences and a facilitated and mentored process of translating experience into learning in order to prepare them for more independent inquiry. Most SIT programs have 20–25 students led by one academic director plus a number of local staff. Semester programs last 15–16 weeks and summer programs are 4–9 weeks. All programs begin with a thorough orientation that incorporates health and safety information and tools for cross-cultural adaptation. Every program is framed around a critical global issue, which provides a lens through which students explore the issue through theory and its local manifestation. Student learning happens through multiple formats — lectures, field visits, language study, homestays, and day-to-day interactions with local communities — in classroom and field-based settings.

SIT students learn to put into practice appropriate field research methods such as participant observation, cultural analysis, interviews, transects, oral histories, and quantitative data collection. They apply tools of investigation and analysis and develop greater curiosity, confidence, and self-awareness.Every program concludes with a guided reflection and discussion period that examines the impact of the experience. Through this reentry preparation, students are encouraged to consider how they can incorporate their experience in the future. During this time, students also have the opportunity to provide feedback on their program.

==Returnees of SIT programs==
Even prior to the explosion of the popularity of study abroad SIT was generating effective leaders, professionals, and citizens. SIT has a worldwide network of individuals and organizations committed to responsible global citizenship. Those who have completed SIT programs have an understanding of global issues, such as globalization and development. Students are immersed in language while in country and learn new research methods.

There are also many opportunities for those who have returned.

'''Sclerosponges''' are [[sea sponge|sponge]]s with a soft body that covers a hard, often massive skeleton made of [[calcium carbonate]], either [[aragonite]] or [[calcite]]. Because of their long life span (500-1,000 years) it is thought that analysis of the [[aragonite]] [[skeleton]]s of these sponges could extend data regarding [[ocean]] [[temperature]], [[salinity]], and other variables farther into the past than has been previously possible. Their dense skeletons are deposited in an organized chronological manner, in concentric layers or bands. The layered skeletons look similar to [[reef]] [[coral]]s. Therefore, sclerosponges are also called '''coralline sponges'''.

Sclerosponges were first proposed as a class of sponges, '''Sclerospongiae''', in 1970 by Hartman and Goreau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = W. D. Hartman and T. F. Goreau|year = 1970|title = Jamaican coralline sponges: Their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[ecology]] and [[fossil]] relatives|journal = Symp. Zool. Soc. Lond.|volume = 25|pages = 205–243}} (Cited by [http://mgg.rsmas.miami.edu/groups/sil/work1.htm].)&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later found by Vacelet that sclerosponges occur in different classes of [[sea sponge|Porifera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = J. Vacelet|year = 1985|title = Coralline sponges and the evolution of the Porifera|journal = System. Assoc. Spec.|volume = 28|pages = 1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; That means that sclerosponges are not a closely related ([[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]]) group of sponges. Like [[bat]]s and [[bird]]s that independently developed the ability to fly, different sponges developed the ability to build a calcareous skeleton independently and during different times in [[Geologic History of Earth|Earth history]]. Fossil sclerosponges are already known from the [[Cambrian Period|Cambrian]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = J. Reitner|year = 1992|title = Coralline Spongien.

See http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~palaeont/JOURNAL.HTM --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Sclerosponges include the species ''Ceratoporella nicholsoni'', ''Stromatospongia vermicola'', ''Hispidopetra miniana'', ''S. norae'', ''Goreauiella auriculatra'', and ''Merlia sp.'', which were described in detail by Lang et al. in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7220">{{short description|A type of activated sludge process for the treatment of wastewater}}
'''Sequencing batch reactors''' ('''SBR''') or '''sequential batch reactors''' are a type of [[activated sludge]] process for the [[wastewater treatment|treatment of wastewater]]. SBR reactors treat wastewater such as [[sewage]] or output from [[anaerobic digester]]s or [[mechanical biological treatment]] facilities in batches. Oxygen is bubbled through the mixture of wastewater and activated sludge to reduce the organic matter (measured as [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) and [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD)). The treated effluent may be suitable for discharge to surface waters or possibly for use on land.

==Overview==
While there are several configurations of SBRs, the basic process is similar. The installation consists of one or more tanks that can be operated as [[plug flow]] or completely mixed reactors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Irvine|first = Robert L.|last2 = Busch|first2 = Arthur W.|date = 1979-01-01|title = Sequencing Batch Biological Reactors: An Overview|jstor = 25039819|journal = Journal (Water Pollution Control Federation)|volume = 51|issue = 2|pages = 235–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tanks have a “flow through” system, with raw wastewater (''influent'') coming in at one end and treated water (''effluent'') flowing out the other. In systems with multiple tanks, while one tank is in settle/decant mode the other is [[aeration|aerating]] and filling. In some systems, tanks contain a section known as the bio-selector, which consists of a series of walls or baffles which direct the flow either from side to side of the tank or under and over consecutive baffles. This helps to mix the incoming Influent and the ''returned activated sludge'' (RAS), beginning the biological digestion process before the liquor enters the main part of the tank.

==Treatment stages==
There are five stages in the treatment process:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#Fill
#React
#Settle
#Decant
#Idle

The inlet valve opens and the tank is being filled in, while mixing is provided by mechanical means (no air). This stage is also called the anoxic stage. Aeration of the mixed liquor is performed during the second stage by the use of fixed or floating mechanical pumps or by transferring air into [[fine bubble diffusers]] fixed to the floor of the tank. No aeration or mixing is provided in the third stage and the settling of suspended solids starts. During the fourth stage the outlet valve opens and the "clean" [[supernatant]] liquor exits the tank.&lt;ref name = "Antonie"&gt;{{cite book   | title = Troubleshooting the Sequencing Batch Reactor | author= Ronald L. Antonie | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location=  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CJ9c1vCBO4cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Sequencing+batch+reactor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAoOHyzMbZAhVotlkKHUtzAkkQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | date = 2011 | page =   | isbn = 9781118058220  | accessdate = 27 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3-8;19}}

==Removal of constituents==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2018}}
Aeration times vary according to the plant size and the composition/quantity of the incoming liquor, but are typically 60 to 90 minutes. The addition of [[oxygen]] to the liquor encourages the multiplication of [[aerobic bacteria]] and they consume the nutrients. This process encourages the conversion of nitrogen from its [[redox|reduced]] [[ammonia]] form to [[oxidized]] [[nitrite]] and [[nitrate]] forms, a process known as [[nitrification]].

To remove [[phosphorus]] compounds from the liquor, [[aluminium sulfate]] (alum) is often added during this period. It reacts to form non-soluble compounds, which settle into the sludge in the next stage.&lt;ref&gt;New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission, Lowell, MA (2005). [http://www.neiwpcc.org/neiwpcc_docs/sbr_manual.pdf "Sequencing Batch Reactor Design and Operational Considerations."]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''settling'' stage is usually the same length in time as the aeration. During this stage the sludge formed by the bacteria is allowed to settle to the bottom of the tank. The aerobic bacteria continue to multiply until the dissolved oxygen is all but used up. Conditions in the tank, especially near the bottom are now more suitable for the [[anaerobic bacteria]] to flourish. Many of these, and some of the bacteria which would prefer an oxygen environment, now start to use oxidized nitrogen instead of oxygen gas (as an alternate [[terminal electron acceptor]]) and convert the nitrogen to a gaseous state, as [[nitrogen oxides]] or, ideally, molecular nitrogen ([[dinitrogen]], N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas. This is known as [[denitrification]].

Anoxic SBR can be used for anaerobic processes, such as the removal of ammonia via [[Anammox]], or the study of slow-growing microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Strous|first = M.|last2 = Heijnen|first2 = J. J.|last3 = Kuenen|first3 = J. G.|last4 = Jetten|first4 = M. S. M.|title = The sequencing batch reactor as a powerful tool for the study of slowly growing anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing microorganisms|journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology|volume = 50|issue = 5|pages = 589–596|doi = 10.1007/s002530051340|year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the reactors are purged of oxygen by flushing with inert gas and there is no aeration.

As the bacteria multiply and die, the sludge within the tank increases over time and a waste activated sludge (WAS) pump removes some of the sludge during the settle stage to a digester for further treatment. The quantity or “age” of sludge within the tank is closely monitored, as this can have a marked effect on the treatment process.

The sludge is allowed to settle until clear water is on the top 20 to 30 percent of the tank contents.

The decanting stage most commonly involves the slow lowering of a scoop or “trough” into the basin. This has a piped connection to a lagoon where the final effluent is stored for disposal to a wetland, tree growing lot, ocean outfall, or to be further treated for use on parks, golf courses etc.

==Conversion==
In some situations in which a traditional treatment plant cannot fulfill required treatment (due to higher loading rates, stringent treatment requirements, etc.) the owner might opt to convert their traditional system into a multi-SBR plant. Conversion to SBR will create a longer sludge age, minimizing sludge handling requirements downstream of the SBR.&lt;ref name = "Antonie"/&gt;{{rp|8-10}}

The reverse can also be done where in SBR Systems would be converted into extended aeration (EA) systems. SBR treatment systems that could not cope up with a sudden constant increase of influent would easily be converted into EA plants. Extended aeration plants are more flexible in flow rate, eliminating restrictions presented by pumps located throughout the SBR systems. [[Clarifier]]s can be retrofitted in the equalization tanks of the SBR.

The '''Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope (SEST)''' was a 15-metre diameter [[radio telescope]] located at the [[La Silla Observatory]] in [[Chile]]. The telescope was built in 1987 as a combined project between [[European Southern Observatory|ESO]] and [[Onsala Space Observatory]], with contributions from Finland and Australia.&lt;ref name="oso"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chalmers.se/rss/oso-en/observations/sest

[[File:Astro-b tenma.gif|thumb|right|Tenma (Japanese for "Pegasus").]]
'''Tenma''', known as '''ASTRO-B''' before launch, was [[Japan]]'s second [[X-ray astronomy]] satellite, developed by the [[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science]].  It was launched on February 20, 1983 using a [[Mu (rocket)|M-3S-3]] rocket as the vehicle.

Battery failure in July 1984 caused the operation to become limited, and continuing problems lead to the termination of X-ray observation in 1985. It reentered the atmosphere on January 19, 1989.

== Highlights ==
* Discovery of the iron helium-like emission from the galactic ridge 
* Iron line discovery and/or study in many LMXRB, HMXRB and AGN 
* Discovery of an absorption line at 4 keV in the X1636-536 Burst spectra

In [[human sexuality]], '''top''', '''bottom''' and '''versatile''' are [[sex position]]s during [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], especially [[Men who have sex with men|between two men]]. A top is usually a person who [[Sexual penetration|penetrates]], a bottom is usually one who receives penetration, and a versatile engages in both activities or is open to engaging in either activity. These terms may be elements of [[self-identity]] that indicate an individual's usual preference, but might also describe broader sexual identities.&lt;ref name="Underwood"&gt;{{cite book | author =Steven Gregory Underwood|title =Gay men and anal eroticism: tops, bottoms, and versatiles|isbn = 1-56023-375-3|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|pages=225 pages|accessdate=2011-12-02|url=https://books.google.com/?id=i4wRl0_8NuUC&amp;pg=PA4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Top,'' ''bottom'' and ''versatile'' are also used in [[BDSM]] to describe unrelated identities and practices.

==Top==
A top is usually a person who engages in the penetrative role during sexual activity; for [[Men who have sex with men|men who have sex with men (MSMs)]], this often involves penetration using the [[Human penis|penis]] during [[Anal sex|anal]] or [[Oral sex|oral]] sex.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; ''Top'' is also used as a verb meaning "to penetrate another". ''Top'' may also describe a broader [[self-identity|personal identity]] involving [[Dominance and submission|dominance]] in a [[romantic relationship|romantic]] or [[sexual relationship]]; however, this stipulation is not a requisite element of being a top.

Several related terms exist. With regard to gay male sexuality, a ''{{visible anchor|total top}}'' is one who assumes an exclusively penetrative role for sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gremore|first1=Graham|title=What Do You Do When Your Total Top Boyfriend Refuses To Bottom?|url=http://www.queerty.com/what-do-you-do-when-your-total-top-boyfriend-refuses-to-bottom-20150504|accessdate=24 July 2015|work=Queerty|date=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''{{visible anchor|power top}}'' is one noted for their great skill or aggressiveness in topping.  A ''{{visible anchor|service top}}'' is "one who tops under the direction of an eager bottom".&lt;ref name="DJ Symptomatic"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Carissa|title=It's Symptomatic|url=http://www.documentjournal.com/article/its-symptomatic...-by-carissa-rodriguez|website=Document Journal|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''{{visible anchor|versatile top}}'' is one who prefers to top but who bottoms occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaylife.about.com/od/lovesex/g/versatiletop.htm Versatile Top].

Trevor Hart of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) found that self-identified tops were more likely to act as the penetrative partner in other sexual activities (besides anal intercourse), including oral sex and [[sex toy]] play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bering |first=Jesse |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=gay-male-sex-roles |title=Top Scientists Get to the Bottom of Gay Male Sex Role Preferences |publisher=[[Scientific American]]|accessdate=2011-01-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319014720/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=gay-male-sex-roles|archivedate=2011-03-19|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bottom==

A bottom is usually the receptive partner during sexual penetration. This frequently refers to MSMs who are penetrated through the [[Human anus|anus]] during anal sex.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; ''Bottom'' is also used as a verb meaning "to be penetrated by another, whether anally or orally". ''Bottom'' may also describe a wider social context of [[Dominance and submission|submission]] within a romantic or sexual relationship, though this element does not apply to all people who prefer to bottom.

In gay male sexuality, a ''total bottom'' is someone who assumes an exclusively passive or receptive role during anal or oral intercourse. A ''{{visible anchor|power bottom}}'' is someone who aggressively enjoys being the receptive partner.  A ''{{visible anchor|versatile bottom}}'' is one who prefers to bottom but who tops occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaylife.about.com/od/lovesex/g/versatilebottom.htm Versatile Bottom]. Gaylife.about.com (2012-01-01). Retrieved on 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The term {{visible anchor|receiver}} or {{visible anchor|receptive partner}} may be preferred by some. An ''oral bottom'' (alternatively described as being the "oral active" partner) is the exclusively receptive partner in oral sex, providing the penetrative partner, or ''oral top'' (alternatively described as being the "oral passive" partner), with unreciprocated [[fellatio]] and [[irrumatio]].

==Versatile==

''Versatile'' refers to a person who enjoys both topping and bottoming, or being dominant and submissive, and may alternate between the two in sexual situations.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 17879166|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Role+versatility+among+men+who+have+sex+with+men+in+urban+Peru.-a0168586762 |title=Role versatility among men who have sex with men in urban Peru|year= 2007|last1= Goodreau|first1= SM|last2= Peinado|first2= J|last3= Goicochea|first3= P|last4= Vergara|first4= J|last5= Ojeda|first5= N|last6= Casapia|first6= M|last7= Ortiz|first7= A|last8= Zamalloa|first8= V|last9= Galvan|first9= R|last10=Sanchez |first10=Jorge R. |volume= 44|issue= 3|pages= 233–9|doi= 10.1080/00224490701443676|journal= Journal of Sex Research|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maennerarzt-linz.at/index.php?id=84 "Männer, die sowohl passiven als auch aktiven Analsex praktizieren, nennt man ''versatile''."] Georg Pfau, Präventionsmedizin für den Mann, Linz 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''Flip-flop'' or ''flip fuck'' commonly describes switching from top to bottom during one sexual encounter between two men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18288599|author=Michael D.

Versatility is a concept of [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].&lt;ref name="martinplevine1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine |first=Martin P. |authorlink= |author2=Kimmel, Michael S.  |title=Gay Macho: The Life and Death of the homosexual Clone |year=1998 |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Versatility'', though, is not limited to the simple acts of anal, oral, or vaginal penetration, but also includes the splitting of duties and responsibilities in the relationship.&lt;ref name="jayyoung1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jay |first=Karla |authorlink= |author2=Young, Allen  |title=The gay report: Lesbians and gay men speak out about sexual experiences and lifestyles |year=1979 |publisher=Summit |location=New York |isbn=0-671-40013-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The reciprocal scenario, where both men take turns fucking each other, is often exercised as a celebration of equality. What sets this scenario apart from the others is the versatility of the men involved. Versatility is a unique and important feature of male anal sex. Some men consider it liberating;&amp;nbsp;... Versatility to them is akin to speaking two different languages. It requires a special kind of playfulness, creativity, curiosity, and coordination. |Steven G. Underwood|''Gay Men and anal eroticism: tops, bottoms, and versatiles'', Harrington Park Press 2003}}

According to some, living a ''versatile lifestyle'' implies a certain openness to new things and an opposition to [[labels]], [[stereotype]]s and [[generalization]]s. Therefore, this concept differs from heterosexual relationships where sexual compatibility does not begin with guessing who will end up as top or bottom.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt;
In self descriptions of men seeking sex with other men, they may refer to themselves as a versatile top or versatile bottom in addition to other commonly used terms.

A 2009 Austrian study on [[gay pornography]] has shown that at least 82.4% of all men performing in the male [[porn industry]] are versatile at some point during their career. In this study, the performances of 5,556 actors were considered. 10.8% performed only in the top role, 6.8% only as bottoms. The study also found that the actor with the [[human penis size|larger penis]] was more likely to act as the top.&lt;ref&gt;Michelides, Christian: ''Männlichkeitskonstruktionen der Pornografie zur Jahrtausendwende,'' Wien 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Versatility is a common theme of [[erotic artist]] [[Tom of Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Arell| first = Berndt  | last2 = Mustola  | first2 = Kati | title = Tom of Finland: Ennennäkemätöntä – Unforeseen  | publisher = Like| year = 2006 | isbn = 952-471-843-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[trans men]] who still have a [[vagina]], topping and bottoming can also involve penile penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hivplusmag.com/sex-dating/2015/11/23/gay-sex-ed-staying-safe-while-topping-or-bottoming |title=Gay Sex Ed: Staying Safe While Topping or Bottoming |publisher=[[LPI Media|HIV Plus Magazine]] |accessdate=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role vs. position among sexualities==

''Top'', ''bottom'' and ''versatile'', with regard to sexual activity between males, refer specifically to the penetrative role, regardless of the physical positioning during sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaylife.about.com/od/anal/a/amitoporbottom.htm Topping or Bottoming – How To Know If You're A Top Or Bottom]. Gaylife.about.com (2012-01-01). Retrieved on 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in positions where the inserting partner lies on his back and the receptive partner straddles the inserting partner, the inserting partner is still considered to assume the "top" role, even though he is positioned on the bottom (and vice versa). When used in reference to heterosexual and [[Lesbian sexual practices|lesbian sex]], the terms ''top,'' ''bottom'' and ''versatile'' usually refer only to position and not to the penetrative role.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Prevalence==

No scientific study has ever been conducted as to what percentage of the gay and bisexual male population prefers any given role. The popular assumption is that the majority prefer to bottom and that those who prefer to top are in the minority. A tally of 55,464 profiles on [[gay.com]] from the [[United States]] showed that 26.46% preferred top, while 31.92% preferred bottom, and the largest group (41.62%) preferred versatile. The preferences seemed to vary by state, however. In Wyoming, for example, 16% preferred top, 44% preferred bottom, and 40% preferred versatile. In West Virginia, tops outnumbered bottoms by a slim margin (32% top, 29% bottom, and 39% versatile). In Oregon, "versatile" profiles made up nearly half (48.42%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightacting.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?p=222697#p222697 Best states for tops, bottoms, versatiles]. Straightacting.com. Retrieved on 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==BDSM==

In [[BDSM]], the terms ''top'', ''bottom'' and ''switch'' are related, but are a BDSM-distinct phenomenon. BDSM seems to have adopted and [[derivation (linguistics)|derived]] these terms as [[loan words]] from [[gay culture]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Other==

In the [[hanky code]], a person flagging the top or active  role would wear the hanky in the left pocket, the bottom or passive role on the right. Acts which were not divisible into distinct roles however, such as "69" or "anything" followed a pattern where one flagged interest by wearing the hanky on the right, uninterest by wearing it on the left, and preferences that did not relate to sexual mechanics, such as uniform fetishism or prostitution, followed a pattern where the seeker flagged on the left and the object of desire flagged on the right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://user.xmission.com/~trevin/hanky.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''side'' has been proposed by Huffington Post contributor [[Joe Kort]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joe-kort-phd/guys-on-the-side-looking-beyond-gay-tops-and-bottoms_b_3082484.html Guys on the 'Side': Looking Beyond Gay Tops and Bottoms] Huffingtonpost.com Retrieved 2014-10-02&lt;/ref&gt; for gay men who are not interested in anal sex.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1502">In [[database theory|relational database theory]], a '''tuple-generating dependency''' (TGD) is a certain kind of constraint on a relational database. It is a subclass of the class of [[embedded dependency|embedded dependencies]] (EDs). A TGD is a sentence in first-order logic of the form:

A relational atom has the form R(w1, ..., wh) where each of the w, ..., wh, wi, wj, are variables or constants. An algorithm known as [[Chase (algorithm)|the chase]] takes as input an instance that may or may not satisfy a set of TGDs (or more generally EDs), and, if it terminates (which is a priori undecidable), outputs an instance that does satisfy the TGDs.

The '''United States Army Intelligence Center of Excellence''' (USAICoE) is the [[United States Army]]'s school for professional training of [[military intelligence]] personnel.  It is a component of [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command]].

==History==
The center was relocated from [[Fort Holabird|Ft. Holabird]], Maryland to [[Fort Huachuca, Arizona]] in 1971. The move involved more than 120 moving vans, a unit train and several aircraft.  The initial intelligence training facilities were a [[World War II]] hospital complex that had not been occupied in several years.

==Training==
The school conducts resident courses for [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]], [[warrant officer]], and [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]] personnel, as well as for international military students in military exchange programs.  United States Army personnel who train at the school become members of the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)#Military Intelligence Corps|Military Intelligence Corps]]. AIT students training to become Systems Maintainers (42 weeks), Intelligence Analysts (16 weeks), Human Intelligence Collectors (19 weeks), Geospatial Intelligence Imagery Analyst (22 weeks), UAS Operators (23 weeks), and Special Agents with [[United States Army Counterintelligence]], all receive training here.

==Military Intelligence Hall of Fame==
The school also administers the [[Military Intelligence Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/agency/army/tradoc/usaic/mipb/1998-2/HOFbios.htm Hall of Fame Bios], fas.org, retrieved 2007-11-07&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Origin==
Originating in Ancient Greece, rhetoric has been widely discussed for thousands of years. Sophists first coined the idea as an abstract term to help label the concept while Aristotle more narrowly defined rhetoric as a message's potential to influence audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rhetorical tradition : readings from classical times to the present|last=|first=|date=1990|publisher=Bedford Books of St. Martin's Press|others=Bizzell, Patricia., Herzberg, Bruce.|isbn=9780312003487|location=Boston|pages=22|oclc=21325600}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Linguists and other researchers often define rhetoric through the well-known [[Rhetoric#Canons|five cannons of rhetoric]]. Over time, this definition has evolved, expanded, and raised serious debate as new digital mediums of communicating have developed.

Visual rhetoric's first mentioning (1977) brought to light a new way to evaluate other communication means, showing the relevance of traditional rhetorical theories to the still photographic medium.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Image, music, text|last=Roland.|first=Barthes,|date=1977|publisher=Hill and Wang|others=Heath, Stephen.|isbn=978-0374521363|location=New York|oclc=3414738}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barthes explained visual rhetoric generally as the implied and interpreted messages from the work, yet these bigger messages often extend beyond the initial superficial interpretation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Visual rhetoric uses a variety of tools to hook readers within its mediums (e.g. gifs).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140809020040-134901798-attraction-and-persuasion-in-advertising-a-beginner-s-guide-to-visual-rhetoric/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230000000/https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140809020040%2D134901798%2Dattraction%2Dand%2Dpersuasion%2Din%2Dadvertising%2Da%2Dbeginner%2Ds%2Dguide%2Dto%2Dvisual%2Drhetoric/|title=Attraction and Persuasion in Advertising - A Beginner's Guide to Visual Rhetoric|last=Ly-Le|first=Tuong-Minh|date=August 9, 2014|website=LinkedIn|archive-date=2016-12-30|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although similar in nature, one striking difference between visual and classical rhetoric is the newfound outlook on Aristotle's original cannons. Linda Scott created a newfound audience by constructing new cannons exclusive to visual rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Instead of closely monitoring the content, as with the initial five cannons, Scott's focused on the visual medium's ability to ''invent'' and argument, ''arrangement'' of the item, and all coupled with a meaningful ''delivery'' of presentation. Since its inception, popular studies have appeared in published works to discuss the role of visual rhetoric in many facets of human life, especially advertising.

The term emerged largely as an effort to set aside a certain area of study that would focus attention on specific rhetorical elements of visual mediums.&lt;ref name="Hill2004" /&gt; Historically, the study of rhetoric has been geared toward linguistics.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  Visual symbols were deemed trivial and subservient and thus, were largely ignored as part of a rhetorical argument. As a result, modern rhetorical theory developed with a significant exclusion of these visual symbols, ignoring the field of visual rhetoric as a separate area of study.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  Scholars of visual rhetoric analyze photographs, drawings, paintings, graphs and tables, interior design and architecture, sculpture, Internet images, and film.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  From a rhetorical perspective, the focus is on the contextual response rather than the aesthetic response.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  An aesthetic response is a viewer's direct perception with the sensory aspects of the visual, whereas with a rhetorical response, meaning is given to the visual.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  Every part of the artifact has significance in the message being conveyed; each line, each shading, each person has a purpose.&lt;ref name="10/21/13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.uncw.edu/atkinsa/496/Framing%20the%20Study%20of%20Visual%20Rhetoric.pdf|title=Framing the Study of Visual Rhetoric: Toward a Transformation for Rhetorical Theory|last=Foss|first=Sonja|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As visual rhetoricians study images and symbols, their findings catalyze challenges to the linguistic meaning altogether, allowing a more holistic study of the rhetorical argument to emerge with the introduction of visual elements.

=== Composition ===
The field of [[composition studies]] has recently returned its attention to visual rhetoric. In an increasingly visual society, proponents of visual rhetoric in composition classes suggest that increased literacy requires writing and visual communication skills. Visual communication skills relate to an understanding of the mediated nature of all communication, especially to an awareness of the act of representation.&lt;ref name="Hill2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="George2002" /&gt; Visual rhetoric can be utilized in a composition classroom to assist with writing and rhetoric development.  {{Main|Visual rhetoric and composition}}
[[File:Canada Stop sign.svg|thumb|A stop sign is an example of semiotics in everyday life.  Drivers understand that the sign means they must stop. Stop signs exist in a larger context of road signs, all with different meanings, designed for traffic safety.]]

=== Semiotics ===
Visual rhetoric is closely related to the study of [[semiotics]], which is the study of the use of signs and symbols and their meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/semiotics|title=Definition of SEMIOTICS|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semiotic theory seeks to describe the rhetorical significance of sign-making. The central idea of the theory is that a sign does not exist outside of a contextual experience, but it only exists in relation to other signs, objects, and entities. Therefore, the sign belongs to a larger system, and when taken out of context of other signs, is rendered meaningless and uncommunicable. The parts of a semiotic are divided into two parts: the material part of the sign is known as the ''form of expression,'' the meaning of the form of expression is known as ''form of content''.&lt;ref name="Ehses, Lupton" /&gt; In semiotic theory, the expression only has meaningful content when existing in a larger contextual framework.

=== Areas of Focus ===
While studying visual objects, rhetorical scholars tend to have three areas of study: nature, function, or evaluation.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  Nature encompasses the literal components of the artifact.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  This is a primary focus of visual rhetoric because in order to understand the function of an image, it is necessary to understand the substantive and stylistic nature of the artifact itself.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  Function holds a somewhat literal definition—it represents the purpose an image serves for an audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.uncw.edu/atkinsa/496/Framing%20the%20Study%20of%20Visual%20Rhetoric.pdf|title=Framing a Study of Visual Rhetoric: Toward a Transformation of Rhetorical Theory|last=Foss|first=Sonja|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The function, or purpose, of an image may be to evoke a certain emotion.&lt;ref name="Foss" /&gt;  The evaluation of an artifact determines if the image serves its function.

== Rhetorical Application ==
Visual rhetoric studies how humans use images to communicate.  Elements of images, such as size color, line, and shape, are used to convey messages.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Multimodality--a Social Semiotic Approach to Contemporary Communication|last=Kress|first=Gunther|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=9780415320610|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In images, meanings are created by the layout and spatial positions of these elements.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The entities that constitute an image are socially, politically, and culturally constructed. The same image may represent different rhetorical meanings depending on the audience. The choice and arrangement of the elements in an image should be used to achieve the desired rhetorical effects and convey messages accurately to specific audiences, societies, and cultures.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The use of images is a conscious, communicative decision as the colors, form, medium, and size are each chosen on purpose.&lt;ref name="10/21/132"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.uncw.edu/atkinsa/496/Framing%20the%20Study%20of%20Visual%20Rhetoric.pdf|title=Framing the Study of Visual Rhetoric: Toward a Transformation for Rhetorical Theory|last=Foss|first=Sonja|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a person may come in contact with a sign, but if they have no relation to the sign, its message is arbitrary. Therefore, in order for artifacts or products to be conceptualized as visual rhetoric, they must be symbolic, involve human intervention, and be presented to an audience for the purpose of communicating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.uncw.edu/atkinsa/496/Framing%20the%20Study%20of%20Visual%20Rhetoric.pdf|title=Framing the Study of Visual Rhetoric Toward a Transformation of Rhetorical Theory|last=Foss|first=Sonja|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Rhetoric of the Image," French theorist Roland Barthes examines the semiotic nature of images, and the ways that images function to communicate specific messages. Barthes points out that messages transmitted by visual images include coded iconic and non-coded iconic linguistic messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Theory--An Introduction|last=Borchers|first=Timothy|publisher=Waveland Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1577667315|location=Long Grove ILL|pages=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visual rhetorical images can be categorized into two dimensions: meaning operation and visual structure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Meaning operation refers to the relations and connections between elements in visual images. Visual structure refers to the way that the elements are visually displayed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Barbara|last2=McQuarrie|first2=Edward|date=2004|title=Beyond Visual Metaphor: A New Typology of Visual Rhetoric in Advertising|journal=Marketing Theory|volume=4(1/2)|pages=113–136|doi=10.1177/1470593104044089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern Application ==
Visual images have always played a role in communication, however the recent advancements in technology have enabled users to produce and share images on a mass scale.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McComiskey|first=Bruce|date=1 Jan 2014|title=Visual Rhetoric and the New Public Discourse|url=|journal=JAC: A Journal of Rhetoric, Culture, &amp; Politics|volume=24|pages=187–206|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mass communication of images has made spread of news and information a much quicker process.  As a result, certain images may go "viral", meaning the image may have been shared and seen by a large number of audiences, and attracted mainstream media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-it-mean-to-go-viral-3486225|title=What Does 'Going Viral Online' Really Mean?|work=Lifewire|access-date=2018-03-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Images are utilized in a variety of ways for a number of purposes. From business to art to entertainment, the versatility of images in popular culture have some scholars arguing words will eventually become outdated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Advertisements ===
Advertisers know that their consumers are able to associate one thing to another; therefore, when an ad shows two things that seemingly different, they know that the consumer will find a connection between the two.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Barbara|last2=McQuarrie|first2=Edward|date=2004|title=Beyond visual metaphor: A new typology of visual rhetoric in advertising|url=https://courses.helsinki.fi/sites/default/files/course-material/4482592/22.3_MT2004%20Phillips.pdf|journal=Marketing Theory|volume=4|pages=113–136|doi=10.1177/1470593104044089}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisers also find ways to make sure that the consumer creates a positive association between what they are selling and whatever they are associating their product with.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In advertising, there are nine main classifications for how ads incorporate visual rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These classifications vary in complexity with the least complex being when advertisers juxtapose their product with another image (listed as 1,2,3).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After juxtaposition, the complexity is increased with fusion, which is when an advertiser's product is combined with another image (listed as 4,5,6).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most complex is replacement, which replaces the product with another product (listed as 7,8,9). Each of these sections also include a variety of richness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most rich would be connection, which shows how one product is associated with another product (listed as 1,4,7).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The next rich would be similarity, which shows how a product is like another product or image (listed as 2,5,8,).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, the most rich would be opposition, which is when advertisers show how their product is not like another product or image (listed as 3,6,9).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
# Advertisers can put their product next to another image in order to have the consumer associate their product with the presented image.
# Advertisers can put their product next to another image to show the similarity between their product and the presented image.
# Advertisers can put their product next to another image in order to show the consumer that their product is nothing like what the image shows.
# Advertisers can combine their product with an image in order to have the consumer associate their product with the presented image.
# Advertisers can combine their product with an image to show the similarity between their product and the presented image.
# Advertisers can combine their product with another image in order to show the consumer that their product is nothing like what the image shows.
# Advertisers can replace their product with an image to have the consumer associate their product with the presented image.
# Advertisers can replace their product with an image to show the similarity between their product and the presented image.
# Advertisers can replace their product with another image to show the consumer that their product is nothing like what the image shows.
Each of these categories varies in complexity, where putting a product next to a chosen image is the simplest and replacing the product entirely is the most complex.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The reason why putting a product next to a chosen image is the most simple is because the consumer has already been shown that there is a connection between the two.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In other words, the consumer just has to figure out why there is the connection. However, when advertisers replace the product that they are selling with another image, then the consumer must first figure out the connection and figure out why the connection was made.

=== Visual Arts ===
Visual [[Trope (linguistics)|trope]]s and tropic thinking are a part of visual rhetoric. While the field of visual rhetoric isn't necessarily concerned with the aesthetic choices of a piece, the same principles of visual composition may be applied to the study and practice of [[visual art]]. For example, [[figures of speech]], such as [[personification]] or [[allusion]], may be implemented in the creation of an artwork. A painting may ''allude'' to peace with an olive branch or to Christianity with a cross; in the same way, an artwork may employ personification by attributing human qualities to a non-human entity. In general, however, visual art is a separate field of study than visual rhetoric.[[File:Grafiti corazón.jpg|thumb|This image portrays a young person holding a heart. Instead of looking at this image literally, rhetoricians will observe the keyhole in the heart's center and think critically about this image's significance.]]

=== Graffiti ===
[[Graffiti]] is a "pictorial or visual inscription on a {{sic|public|ally}} accessible surface."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanauer|first=David|date=2011|title=The discursive construction of the separation wall at Abu Dis: Graffiti as political discourse|url=|journal=Journal of Language and Politics|volume=10|pages=301–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hanauer, Graffiti achieves three functions; the first is to allow marginalized texts to participate in the public discourse, the second is that graffiti serves the purpose of expressing openly "controversial contents", and the third is to allow "marginal groups to the possibility of expressing themselves publicly."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanauer|first=David|date=2004|title=Silence, voice and erasure: psychological embodiment  in graffiti at the site of Prime Minister Rabin's assassination|url=|journal=The Arts in Psychotherapy|volume=31|pages=29–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates and Martin note that this form of rhetoric has been around even in ancient Pompeii; with an example from 79 A.D. reading, "Oh wall, so many men have come here to scrawl, I wonder that your burdened sides don't fall".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bates|first=John|date=1980|title=The thematic content of graffiti as a nonreactive indicator of male and female attitudes|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume=16|issue=4|pages=300–315|doi=10.1080/00224498009551087}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gross and Gross indicated that graffiti is capable of serving a rhetorical purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gross|first=Daniel D.|last2=Gross|first2=Timothy|date=1993|title=TAGGING:Changing Visual Patterns and the Rhetorical Implications of a New Form of Graffiti|url=|journal=Review of General Semantics|volume=50|pages=251– 264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a more modern context, Wiens' (2014) research showed that graffiti can be considered an alternative way of creating rhetorical meaning for issues such as homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=HOME IS WHERE THE SPRAY-PAINTED HEART IS: GRAFFITI AS RHETORICAL RESISTANCE ON SKID ROW|last=Wiens|first=Brianna I.|work=Master thesis|publisher=ProQuest|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Ley and Cybriwsky graffiti can be an expression of territory, especially within the context of gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ley|first=David|date=1974|title=Urban Graffiti as Territorial Markers|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/39166347/ley1974.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1518993322&amp;Signature=ci5e6vVAM1PDYr%2FBHksRpCNFbkQ%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DURBAN_GRAFFITI_AS_TERRITORIAL_MARKERS.pdf|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=64|pages=491}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This form of Visual Rhetoric is meant to communicate meaning to anyone who so happens to see it, and due to its long history and prevalence, several styles and techniques have emerged to capture the attention of an audience.

=== Visual Rhetoric of Text ===
While visual rhetoric is usually applied to denote the non-textual artifacts, the use and presentation of words is still critical to understanding the visual argument as a whole. Beyond how a message is conveyed, the presentation of that message encompasses the study and practice of [[typography]]. Professionals in fields from graphic design to book publishing make deliberate choices about how a typeface looks, including but not limited to concerns of functionality, emotional evocations, and cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bierut, "Now You See It and Other Essays on Design." Princeton Architectural Press. New York. November 7, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memes ===
Though a relatively new way of using images, [[Internet meme|memes]] are one of the more pervasive forms of visual rhetoric. Considered by scholars to be a subversive form of communication,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Heidi|date=2013|title=Subversive Memes: Internet Memes as a Form of Visual Rhetoric|url=https://spir.aoir.org/index.php/spir/article/view/785/pdf|journal=Selected Papers of Internet Research|volume=14|pages=|via=AOiR}}&lt;/ref&gt; memes are a style of rhetoric that "combines elements of the semiotic and discursive approaches to analyze the persuasive elements of visual texts." Furthermore, memes fit into this rhetorical category because of their persuasive nature and their ability "to draw viewers into the argument’s construction via the viewer’s cognitive role in completing “visual enthymemes” to fill in the unstated premise."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to a 2013 study by Bauckhage, et al., the temporal nature of most memes and their "hype cycles" of popularity are in line with the behavior of a typical [[fad]] and suggest that after they proliferate and become mainstream, memes quickly lose their appeal and popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauckhage|first=Christian|last2=Kersting|first2=Kristian|last3=Hadiji|first3=Fabian|date=2013-06-28|title=Mathematical Models of Fads Explain the Temporal Dynamics of Internet Memes|url=https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM13/paper/viewPaper/6022|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the intrinsic factors of memes that affect their potential rise to popularity is similarity. A 2014 study conducted by researcher Michele Coscia concluded that meme similarity has a negative correlation to meme popularity, and can therefore be used, along with factors like social network structure, to explain the popularity of various memes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coscia|first=Michele|date=2014-09-26|title=Average is Boring: How Similarity Kills a Meme's Success|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep06477|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=4|issue=1|pages=6477|doi=10.1038/srep06477|pmid=25257730|pmc=4175728|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study by Mazambani, et al. concluded that other factors of influence in meme spread within an online community include how relevant a meme is to the "topic focus" or theme of the online community as well as whether the posting user is in a position of power within an online setting.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazambani|first=Gideon|last2=Carlson|first2=Maria A.|last3=Reysen|first3=Stephen|last4=Hempelmann|first4=Christian F.|date=2015|title=Impact of Status and Meme Content on the Spread of Memes in Virtual Communities|url=https://jyx.jyu.fi/dspace/handle/123456789/47918|journal=Human Technology: An Interdisciplinary Journal on Humans in ICT Environments|volume=11|issue=2|pages=148–164|doi=10.17011/ht/urn.201511113638}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memes that are consistent with a group's theme and memes that originate from lower-status members within the group spread faster than memes that are inconsistent and are created by members of a group that are in positions of power.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Scholars like Jakub Nowak propose the idea of popular driven media as well. Successful memes originate and proliferate by means of anonymous internet users, not entities like corporations or political parties that have an agenda. For this reason, anonymity is linked to meme popularity and credibility. Nowak asserts that meme authorship should remain anonymous, because this is the only way to let people make the statements that they want to freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nowak|first=Jakub|date=2016|title=Internet meme as meaningful discourse: towards a theory of multiparticipant popular online content|url=https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=458796|journal=Central European Journal of Communication|language=English|volume=9|issue=16|pages=73–89|issn=1899-5101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
