The '''A370''' is a primary [[road]] in [[England]] running from Bath Road, near [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Temple Meads railway station]] in the city of [[Bristol]] to [[Weston-super-Mare]] before continuing to the village of  [[East Brent]] in [[Somerset]]. A more direct route from Bristol to East Brent is the [[A38 road|A38]].

==Route==

Within Bristol urban area, the road begins at Bath Road roundabout, at the busy junction with A4 near Temple Meads. It then follows the new cut of River Avon west to Cumberland basin, via [[Bedminster, Bristol|Bedminster]].

From here on, it begins to head south-westwards out of the City. It first bypasses [[Long Ashton]], then passes through [[Flax Bourton]], [[Backwell]], [[Brockley, Somerset|Brockley]], [[Cleeve, Somerset|Cleeve]], [[Congresbury]] and Hewish, beyond which it crosses the [[M5 motorway]] at Junction 21.

The road then enters Weston-super-Mare: a dual carriageway extends most of the way, by passing the built-up area, including Junction 21 Enterprise Area to the east of the town. On reaching the waterfront, the road turns south to run partly along the beach, then leaves Weston at Uphill. It passes [[Bleadon]] and [[Lympsham]] before meeting the [[A38 road]] at East Brent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/roadlists/r10/notes.php?number=A370|title=A370: Bristol - East Brent|publisher=SABRE|accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condition==

The A370 can get extremely busy during rush hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Cyclist-killed-road-accidentarticle-546907-details/article.html|title=Cyclist killed in Bristol road accident|last=Harding|first=Julie|date=2008-12-15|publisher=This is Bristol|accessdate=2009-04-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507102020/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Cyclist-killed-road-accidentarticle-546907-details/article.html|archivedate=7 May 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Congestion points include the approaches to the M5 motorway, the traffic lights in Congresbury and the Long Ashton bypass&amp;mdash;which now has a [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]] solely for use by buses, taxis, [[motorcycle]]s, and cars with two or more occupants.

==Future==

As part of the "Greater Bristol Strategic Transport Study", a link road is under consideration to the south of Bristol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwesteip.co.uk/downloads/documents/sts.pdf |title=Greater Bristol Transport Strategy |publisher=Atkins |accessdate=12 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311210020/http://www.southwesteip.co.uk/downloads/documents/sts.pdf |archivedate=11 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelplus.org.uk/media/174199/sbl%20a370%20junctionreportv4final.pdf |title=South Bristol Link – A370 Junction |publisher=North Somerset Council |accessdate=12 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310204450/http://www.travelplus.org.uk/media/174199/sbl%20a370%20junctionreportv4final.pdf |archivedate=10 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in part due to the congestion at Winterstoke Road and [[Barrow Gurney]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Village-calls-North-Somerset-clear-drains-avoid-road-disaster/article-469475-detail/article.html | title=Village calls on North Somerset to clear drains to avoid road disaster | publisher=Evening Post | accessdate=12 December 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120917101857/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Village-calls-North-Somerset-clear-drains-avoid-road-disaster/article-469475-detail/article.html | archivedate=17 September 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which are very busy, especially the latter where the road can only accommodate travelling at one direction at a given time); and the incomplete Bristol Ring Road (A4174).

By 2017, A370 Long Ashton By Pass will be connected to the South Bristol Link (SBL) road, currently under construction as part of the [[MetroBus (Bristol)|MetroBus]] rapid transit scheme, providing a new road linking [[Hengrove]] to Long Ashton By Pass and the Long Ashton Park &amp; Ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Bristol Link|url=http://travelwest.info/metrobus/metrobus-build/south-bristol-link|publisher=Travelwest|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''accession number''' in bioinformatics is a unique identifier given to a [[DNA sequence|DNA]] or [[amino acid sequence|protein]] sequence record to allow for tracking of different versions of that sequence record and the associated sequence over time in a single data repository.  Because of its relative stability, accession numbers can be utilized as [[foreign key]]s for referring to a sequence object, but not necessarily to a unique sequence.  All sequence information repositories implement the concept of "accession number" but might do so with subtle variations.

==LRG==
{{main|Locus Reference Genomic}}
Locus Reference Genomic (LRG) records have unique accession numbers starting with LRG_ followed by a number. They are recommended in the [http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/ Human Genome Variation Society Nomenclature guidelines] as stable genomic reference sequences to report sequence variants in LSDBs and the literature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="74675">The '''Annual BCI Research Award''' is an annual accolade to recognize excellence in the field of [[Brain–computer interface|brain-computer interface]] (BCI) research. The award is open to any person or group in any country. Each year, a different institute known for BCI research is chosen to host the award.

This institute selects a jury from established researchers within the BCI community, which selects ten nominees and then a winner. All ten nominees are invited and expected to submit chapters that summarize their submission to the Award, subsequent progress, and future directions. These chapters are then collected in a book with a major publisher, which also includes an introduction and conclusion with summary information.

The winner of the Annual BCI Research Award also receives $3,000 (1st), $2,000 (2nd), $1,000 (3rd) and a statue at a gala awards ceremony attached to a major conference. g.tec medical engineering GmbH and Guger Technologies OG, companies headquartered in Austria that manufactures BCI products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtec.at|title=Home - g.tec - Guger Technologies|author=g.tec|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; organize the Award together with international institutions.

== Selection Criteria and Procedure ==
The jury is instructed to score all projects based on the following criteria:
* Does the project include a novel application of the BCI?
* Is there any new methodological approach used compared to earlier projects?
* Is there any new benefit for potential users of a BCI?
* Is there any improvement in terms of speed of the system (e.g. bit/min)?
* Is there any improvement in terms of accuracy of the system?
* Does the project include any results obtained from real patients or other potential users?
* Does the approach work online/in real-time?
* Is there any improvement in terms of usability?
* Does the project include any novel hardware or software developments?

Each year, the Annual BCI Research Award follows a rigorous, structured schedule to encourage the best submissions, ensure the most effective decisionmaking processes, and maximize the impact. This section describes the general timeline for each annual. Since the Award is presented at a major conference, the exact dates change each year, but the general procedure will not change.
* Preceding year (after last year’s award): g.tec selects the date and location of the award ceremony, identifies the institute that will host the award, and chooses the Chairman of the Jury.
* The awarding institute selects the jury, submission deadline, and other details.  The award is announced through various means, such as email, website postings, and word of mouth.
* About two months before the award ceremony: all submissions must be emailed to the jury. The jury chooses ten nominees.
* About one month before the award ceremony: the nominees are publicly announced.
* Award Ceremony: The winner is announced at the award ceremony. The ceremony is always scheduled with a major conference, so the exact date and venue changes each year.

== 2018 Award ==
The jury for the [http://www.bci-award.com/2018 BCI Award] was:
*Kai Miller, MD, PhD, PhD (chair),
Stanford University, USA&lt;br&gt;
 
*Natalie Mrachacz-Kersting, PhD (winner 2017) 
Aalborg University, Denmark&lt;br&gt;

*Vivek Prabhakaran, MD, PhD
University of Wisconsin at Madison, USA&lt;br&gt;

*Yijun Wang, PhD
Chinese Academy of Sciences, China&lt;br&gt;

*Milena Korostenskaja, PhD
Florida Hospital for Children&lt;br&gt;

*Sharlene Flesher, PhD
Stanford University&lt;br&gt;

The jury was responsible for selecting twelve nominees, and then three winners, using the same award criteria as earlier years. The Award Ceremony occurred on May 23, 2018 as part of the [http://bcisociety.org/meetings/bci-2018-welcome// 7th International BCI Meeting], which occurred from May 21 to 25, 2018 at the Asilomar Conference Center in Pacific Grove, CA. For the first time, the awards ceremony occurred outside. The emcee (Brendan Allison) announced the nominees and the jury chair (Dr. Miller) presented the awards. Most of the attendees at the BCI meeting were in the audience during the ceremony. The first place winner received $3000 and the prestigious trophy, and the second and third place winners received $2000 and $1000, respectively. All nominees also received a certificate and other awards, and were invited to write a chapter for a [http://www.bci-award.com/Books book series] with [https://www.springer.com/us Springer Publishing] that reviews the nominated projects each year. Twelve projects were nominated in 2018, which are presented below along with their authors and affiliation(s).

== 2012 Award ==
The original deadline for the 2012 Award was 15 July 2012, but was extended to 30 July 2012. The 2012 award was presented at a dinner ceremony at the 2012 conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfn.org/AM2012/|title=Neuroscience 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Society for Neuroscience]], which was 13-17 Oct in New Orleans, Louisiana. The annual SfN conference is a well-established venue for presenting BCI research.

68 projects were submitted for the 2012 Award. Like the two preceding years, the submissions came from groups all over the world, and reflected a wide range of different types of BCIs. Relative to previous years, there was a stronger emphasis on BCIs with direct medical applications (as opposed to pure research, healthy user applications, etc.) Most of the nominated projects were aimed at helping groups with specific medical needs, such as persons with stroke, tetraplegia, epilepsy, paralysis or visual deficits.

===The 2012 BCI Research Award winner was:===

Surjo R. Soekadar, Niels Birbaumer 

Applied Neurotechnology Lab, University Hospital Tübingen and 

Institute of Medical Psychology and Behavioral Neurobiology, Eberhard Karls University, Tübingen, Germany

&lt;br&gt;'''Improving Efficacy of Ipsilesional Brain-Computer Inteface Training in Neurorehabilitation of Chronic Stroke'''

Dr. Eric Leuthardt said that "It is a great pleasure to congratulate the Soekadar and Birbaumer team on their project entitled "Improving Efficacy of Ipsilesional Brain-Computer Interface Training in Neurorehabilitation of Chronic Stroke." Their work is highlighting the important movement of neuroprosthetics towards stroke. There is a fundamental need to use BCI approaches to address this clinical area of motor disability that numbers in the hundreds of thousands per year and stands to increase substantially as the world population ages. BCI for stroke will likely be the next chapter for engineered restorative strategies that could be paradigm shifting in this widespread form of motor impairment."

The 2012 jury again included some of the top figures in BCI research, with a stronger emphasis on medical doctors than previous years. The 2012 jury also included the winner of the 2011 BCI Award, just as the 2012 jury included the winnerof the 2010 BCI Award. For the first time, the jury also included scientists who had been jurors in previous years. Specifically, the jury included Profs. Gerwin Schalk and Gert Pfurtscheller, who were the chairmen of the jury in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The 2012 was chaired by Eric Leuthardt, M.D., and also consisted of:

Gert Pfurtscheller, Ph.D.,

Leigh Hochberg, M.D, Ph.D.,

Gerwin Schalk, Ph.D.,

Moritz Grosse-Wentrup, Ph.D.,

Junichi Ushiba, Ph.D.

Springer Publishing will publish a book about the 2012 BCI Award. Like the prior books about awards in earlier years, the book will include an introduction, discussion, and ten chapters from the ten nominees. These ten chapters will each describe the work submitted and updated information about more recent progress. The book will be edited by Drs. Guger, Allison, and Edlinger.

== 2011 Award ==
The 2011 award was presented at a dinner ceremony at the Hotel Weitzer in Graz, Austria. The ceremony was scheduled around 5th International Brain-Computer Interface Conference, which was held in Graz from 22-24 Sept. 2011. The awarding institute was the Laboratory of Brain-Computer Interfaces, Institute for Knowledge Discovery, Graz University of Technology, which also hosted the conference.

In addition to the usual awards, the winner also received an autographed copy of the book “A Practical guide to Brain-Computer Interfacing with BCI2000”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intechopen.com/articles/show/title/state-of-the-art-in-bci-research-bci-award-2010.%20|title=State-of-the-Art in BCI Research: BCI Award 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associated Events ==
There are a few other awards for BCI research. For example, the Berlin BCI group has hosted several Data Analysis Competitions. These competitions provide data from different types of BCIs (such as P300, ERD, or SSVEP), and competitors attempt to develop data analysis algorithms that can most accurately classify new data. The recently announced HCI Challenge instead focuses on improving the human-computer interaction within BCIs, such as through more natural and friendly interfaces. The X-Prize Foundation lists X-Prizes for BCI and Enduring Brain Computer Communication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xprize.org/prize-development/life-sciences#brain|title=Life Sciences|work=XPRIZE}}&lt;/ref&gt; as “Concepts Under Consideration". The Gao group at Tsinghua University in Beijing coordinated an online BCI competition at a conference that they hosted in 2010, and hosted a second competition in 2012. The Annual BCI Research Award is the only general award open to any facet of BCI research.

'''Aphorismus''' (from the {{Lang-el|ἀφορισμός}}, ''aphorismós'', "a marking off", also "rejection, banishment") is a [[figure of speech]] that calls into question if a word is properly used ("How can you call yourself a man?").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Myers, Wukasch | year = 2003 | title = The Dictionary of Poetic Terms | publisher = University of NORTH TEXAS Press | page = 22 | isbn= 1574411667}}&lt;/ref&gt; It often appears in the form of a [[rhetorical question]] which is meant to imply a difference between the present thing being discussed and the general notion of the subject.

==Examples==
*"For you have but mistook me all this while. / I live with bread like you, feel want, / Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus, / How can you say to me I am a king?" [[William Shakespeare]], ''Richard II'' Act 3, scene 2, 174-177
*"It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is." [[Bill Clinton]], August 17, 1998

'''Arseniosiderite''' is a rare [[arsenate mineral]] formed by the oxidation of other arsenic-containing minerals, such as [[scorodite]] or [[arsenopyrite]]. It occurs in association with beudantite, carminite, dussertite, pharmacolite, pitticite, adamite and erythrite. The name arseniosiderite reflects two major elements of the mineral, arsenic and iron (Greek ''sideros'' means iron).&lt;ref name=hand/&gt;

==History==

AWIS was founded in 1971 at the annual meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB), after a series of champagne brunches organized by an informal women's caucus. After establishing an executive director and an office in Washington, DC, chapters were organized across the country for individual members. Its founding co-presidents were [[Neena Schwartz]] and [[Judith Pool]].&lt;ref name=aan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hampton|first1=Kathleen|title=Women Scientists Probing Discrimination in Their Field|accessdate=5 June 2015|work=Ann Arbor News|date=10 August 1971|url=http://oldnews.aadl.org/node/89833}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rossiter&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rossiter|first1=Margaret|title=Women Scientists in America. ; Forging a New World since 1972.|date=2012|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=9781421403632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with other women in science associations, an early AWIS action involved initiating a [[class action lawsuit]] against the [[National Institutes of Health]] in response to poor representation on NIH grant review committees. The lawsuit was dropped after representatives of the groups, including Schwartz, met with [[Robert Marsten]], then head of the NIH, who solicited recommendations and committed to appointing more women.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite interview |last=Schwartz |first=Neena |interviewer=Michael Chappelle |title=An oral history conducted in 2008 |date=2008 |location=Chevy Chase, Maryland |work=The Endocrine Society, The Clark Sawin Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early projects include the creation of the AWIS Educational Foundation (now known as the Educational Awards) to receive donations and award fellowships. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AWIS History |url=http://www.awis.affiniscape.com/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=34 |publisher=Association for Women in Science |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121045221/http://www.awis.affiniscape.com/displaycommon.cfm?an=1 |archivedate=2012-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1997, AWIS won the Presidents Mentoring Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association for Women in Science, Inc.

'''Biseriate''' is a [[botanical]] term applied to both [[plantae]] and [[fungi]], meaning 'arranged in two rows'. 

The term can refer to any number of structures found within these [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]], from arrangement of leaves to the placement of [[spore]]s.

It becomes useful in [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] for placing a [[species]] within a certain [[genus]], [[Family (biology)|family]], or even [[Order (biology)|order]], based upon [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], when making an initial choice or when [[DNA]] evidence is inconclusive.

The '''bismuth-phosphate process''' was used to extract [[plutonium]] from irradiated uranium taken from [[nuclear reactor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent |country=US |number=2799553 |title=Phosphate method for separation of radioactive elements |inventor=Stanley G. Thompson and Glenn T. Seaborg |status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=2785951 |title=Bismuth Phosphate Method for the Separation of Plutonium from Aqueous Solutions |inventor=Stanley G. Thompson and Glenn T. Seaborg |status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed during [[World War II]] by [[Stanley G. Thompson]], a chemist working for the [[Manhattan Project]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. This process was used to produce plutonium at the [[Hanford Site]]. Plutonium was used in the [[atomic bomb]] that was used in the [[atomic bombing of Nagasaki]] in August 1945. The process was superseded in the 1950s by the REDOX and [[PUREX]] processes.

==Background==
During [[World War II]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Manhattan Project]] attempted to develop the first [[atomic bomb]]s.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=vii}} One method was to make a bomb using [[plutonium]], which was first produced by [[deuteron]] bombardment of [[uranium]] in the {{convert|60|in|cm|adj = on|sp=us}} [[cyclotron]] at the [[Berkeley Radiation Laboratory]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. It was isolated on 14 December 1940 and chemically identified on 23 February 1941, by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], [[Edwin McMillan]], [[Joseph W. Kennedy]] and [[Arthur Wahl]].{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|pp=2–4}} It was thought that [[plutonium-239]] would be [[fissile]] like [[uranium-235]] and suitable for use in an atomic bomb.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=28–30}}

Plutonium could be produced through the irradiation of [[uranium-238]] in a [[nuclear reactor]], although no one had yet built one.&lt;ref name="plutonium"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.osti.gov/opennet/manhattan-project-history/Events/1942-1944_pu/1942-1944_plutonium.htm |title=Manhattan Project: The Plutonium Path to the Bomb, 1942–1944 |publisher=United States Department of Energy – Office of History and Heritage Resources |access-date=16 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not the Manhattan Project's chemists' problem; theirs was to develop a large-scale process for separating [[fission products]], some  of which were dangerously radioactive; uranium, the chemistry of which little was known; and plutonium, the chemistry of which almost nothing at all was known and which at first was only available in microscopic quantities.&lt;ref name="osti"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.osti.gov/opennet/manhattan-project-history/Events/1942-1944_pu/seaborg_plutonium.htm |title=Manhattan Project: Seaborg and Plutonium Chemistry, Met Lab, 1942–1944 |publisher=United States Department of Energy – Office of History and Heritage Resources |access-date=16 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four methods of separation were pursued. Seaborg performed the first successful separation of a weighable quantity of plutonium in August 1942, using a process involving [[lanthanum fluoride]].&lt;ref name="osti" /&gt; [[Isadore Perlman]] and William J. Knox, Jr., looked into peroxide separation because most elements form soluble peroxides in neutral or [[acid]] solution. They soon discovered that plutonium was an exception. After a good deal of experimentation, they found that they could precipitate it by adding [[hydrogen peroxide]] to a dilute [[uranyl nitrate]] solution. They were then able to get the process to work but it produced tons of precipitate, where the lanthanum fluoride process would produce kilograms.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=182–184}}

John E. Willard tried an alternative approach, based on the fact that some silicates absorbed plutonium more readily than other elements; this was found to work but with low efficiency. Theodore T. Magel and Daniel K. Koshland, Jr., researched a solvent-extraction processes and [[Harrison Brown]] and Orville F. Hill experimented with separation using volatility reactions, based on how uranium could be readily volatilized by [[fluorine]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=182–184}} They and other chemists at the Manhattan Project's Radiation Laboratory at the University of California,  [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] at the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Ames Laboratory]] at [[Iowa State College]], explored plutonium chemistry.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=193}} A crucial discovery was that plutonium had two oxidation states, a [[tetravalent]] (+4) state and [[hexavalent]] (+6) state. with different chemical properties.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=89}}

The lanthanum fluoride process became the preferred method for use in the Manhattan Project's plutonium separation [[wikt:semi-works|semiworks]] at the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] and the production facilities at the [[Hanford Site]] but further work with the process revealed difficulties.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=194}} It required large amounts of [[hydrogen fluoride]], which corroded the equipment and Charles M. Cooper from [[DuPont]], who would be responsible for the design and construction of the facilities, began experiencing problems with stabilizing the plutonium in its hexavalent state in the fluoride solution. There were also difficulties with recovering the precipitate through [[filtration]] or [[centrifugation]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=182–184}}

While the chemical engineers worked on these problems, Seaborg asked [[Stanley G. Thompson]], a colleague at Berkeley, to have a look at the possibility of a [[phosphate]] process. It was known that the phosphates of many [[heavy metals]] were insoluble in an acid solutions. Thompson tried phosphates of [[thorium]], uranium, [[cerium]], [[niobium]] and [[zirconium]] without success. He did not expect [[bismuth]] phosphate ({{chem|Bi|P|O|4}}) to work any better but when he tried it on 19 December 1942, he was surprised to find that it carried 98 percent of the plutonium in solution.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=185}} Bismuth phosphate was similar in its crystalline structure to plutonium phosphate and this became known as the bismuth phosphate process.{{sfn|Gerber|1996|p=4–1}}{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=11}} Cooper and Burris B. Cunningham were able to replicate Thompson's results and the bismuth phosphate process was adopted as a fallback in case lanthanum fluoride could not be made to work. The processes were similar and the equipment used for lanthanum fluoride could be adapted for use with Thompson's bismuth phosphate process.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=185}} In May 1943, the DuPont engineers decided to adopt the bismuth phosphate process for use in the Clinton semiworks and the Hanford production site.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=194}}

==Process==
[[File:T Plant at Hanford Site.jpg|thumb|The T Plant was the first plutonium separation plant. It was nicknamed the “Queen Mary” for its resemblance to the ocean liner.]]
The bismuth phosphate process involved taking the irradiated uranium fuel slugs and removing their aluminium cladding. Because there were highly radioactive fission products inside, this had to be done remotely behind a thick concrete barrier.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=208}} This was done in the "Canyons" (B and T buildings) at Hanford. The slugs were dumped into boiling [[sodium hydroxide]] to which [[sodium nitrate]] was added. With the aluminium jackets removed, a dissolver was charged with about three tons of unclad slugs. [[Nitric acid]] was added to dissolve about one ton at a time.{{sfn|Gerber|1996|p=4-6}}

The second step was to separate the plutonium from the uranium and the fission products. [[Bismuth nitrate]] and [[phosphoric acid]] were added, producing bismuth phosphate, which was precipitated carrying the plutonium with it. This was very similar to the lanthanum fluoride process, in which lanthanum fluoride was used as the carrier.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bonestamp.com/sgt/process.htm |title=Thompson's Process |website=bonestamp.com |access-date=17 April 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511030328/http://www.bonestamp.com/sgt/process.htm |archivedate=11 May 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The precipitate was removed from the solution with a centrifuge and the liquid discharged as waste. Getting rid of the fission products reduced the [[gamma radiation]] by 90 percent. The precipitate was a plutonium-containing cake which was placed in another tank and dissolved in nitric acid. [[Sodium bismuthate]] or [[potassium permanganate]] was added to oxidize the plutonium.{{sfn|Gerber|1996|p=4-6}} Plutonium would be carried by the bismuth phosphate in the tetravalent state but not in the hexavalent state.&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt; The bismuth phosphate would then be precipitated as a by product, leaving the plutonium behind in solution.{{sfn|Gerber|1996|p=4-6}}

This step was then repeated in the third step. The plutonium was reduced again by adding [[ferrous ammonium sulfate]]. Bismuth nitrate and phosphoric acid were added and bismuth phosphate precipitated. It was dissolved in nitric acid and the bismuth phosphate was precipitated. This step resulted in reducing the gamma radiation by four more orders of magnitude, so the plutonium-bearing solution now had 100,000-th of the original gamma radiation. The plutonium solution was transferred from the 224 buildings to the 221 buildings, through underground pipes. In the fourth step, phosphoric acid was added and the bismuth phosphate precipitated and removed; potassium permanganate was added to oxidize the plutonium.{{sfn|Gerber|1996|p=4-7}}

In the "crossover" step, the lanthanum fluoride process was used. Lanthanum salts and hydrogen fluoride were added again and lanthanum fluoride was precipitated, while hexavalent plutonium was left in solution.  This removed [[lanthanide]]s like cerium, [[strontium]] and [[lanthanum]], that bismuth phosphate could not. The plutonium was again reduced with [[oxalic acid]] and the lanthanum fluoride process was repeated. This time [[potassium hydroxide]] was added to [[salt metathesis reaction|metathesize]] the solution. Liquid was removed with a centrifuge and the solid dissolved in nitric acid to form plutonium nitrate. At this point, a {{convert|330|USgal|l|adj=on}} batch sent would have been concentrated to {{convert|8|USgal|l}}.{{sfn|Gerber|1996|p=4-7}}

The final step was carried out at the 231-Z building, where hydrogen peroxide, sulfates and [[ammonium nitrate]] were added to the solution and the hexavalent plutonium was precipitated as [[Plutonium(IV) oxide|plutonium peroxide]]. This was dissolved in nitric acid and put into shipping cans, which were boiled in hot air to produce a plutonium nitrate paste. Each can weighed about 1&amp;nbsp;kg &lt;!-- No conversion because US conventional unit for fissile material is kg --&gt; and was shipped to the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]].{{sfn|Gerber|1996|p=4-7}} Shipments were made in a truck carrying twenty cans and the first arrived at Los Alamos  on 2 February 1945.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=309–310}} The plutonium was used in the [[Fat Man]] bomb design tested in the [[Trinity nuclear test]] on 16 July 1945, and in the [[bombing of Nagasaki]] on 9 August 1945.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=375–380, 403–404}}

==Decommissioning==
In 1947, experiments began at Hanford on a new REDOX process, which was more efficient. Construction of a new REDOX plant commenced in 1949 and operations began in January 1952, the B plant closing that year. Improvements to the T plant resulted in a 30 percent increase in productivity and improvements were made to the B plant. There were plans to reactivate the B plant but the new PUREX plant that opened in January 1956 was so efficient that the T plant was closed in March 1956 and plans to reactivate the B plant were abandoned.{{sfn|Gerber|1996|p=4-10}} By 1960, the PUREX plant's output had surpassed the combined output of the B and T plants and the REDOX plant.{{sfn|Gerber|1996|p=4-14}}

'''Burkhard Heim''' ({{IPA-de|haɪm|lang}}; February 9, 1925 – January 14, 2001) was a German theoretical [[physics|physicist]]. He devoted a large portion of his life to the pursuit of his [[unified field theory]], [[Heim theory]].&lt;ref name="Ludwiger"&gt;{{cite web|last = von Ludwiger|first = Illobrand|date = 28 January 2001|title = Zum Tode des Physikers Burkhard Heim|location=Feldkirchen-Westerham|url=http://www.mufon-ces.org/text/deutsch/heim.htm|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of his childhood ambitions was to develop a method of space travel, which contributed to his motivation to find such a theory.&lt;ref name="Lietz"&gt;{{cite news|last = Lietz|first = Haiko|date = 5 January 2006|title = Take a leap into hyperspace|newspaper = New Scientist|volume = 189|issue = 2533|url = 
 https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18925331.200-take-a-leap-into-hyperspace.html|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, Heim was conscripted into the air force.  However, a previous essay about explosives led to his working briefly in a chemical laboratory as an explosives technician, instead. An [[explosion]] in the laboratory caused by the mishandling of unstable compounds left him with debilitating [[Disability|handicaps]]. The accident left him [[amputee|without hands]] and mostly [[Hearing impairment|deaf]] and [[blindness|blind]] when he was 19, forcing him to use [[Krukenberg procedure|Krukenberg hands]]. [[Illobrand von Ludwiger]] claims this to be a terrorist assassination attempt, for which Heim saved the assassins life by "forgiving him".&lt;ref name="Ludwiger"/&gt; Neither name nor motivation of the claimed assassin nor details of the "forgiving" and how this saved his life are given.

His behavior subsequently became progressively [[eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] and [[recluse|reclusive]].&lt;ref name="Ludwiger"/&gt;  Eventually, he retreated into almost total [[solitude|seclusion]], concentrating on developing and refining his [[theory of everything]].

==Academic and work history==
A large proportion of the 76 years of Heim's life was spent on theoretical physics and the formulation of his Heim theory.&lt;ref name="Lietz"/&gt;

===1940s===
In 1943 Heim met [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], who was involved in German [[atom bomb]] research at that time, and told him of his plan to use chemical [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] to facilitate an atomic explosion. This design was based on his idea he developed for a 'clean' [[hydrogen bomb]] when he was 18. Heisenberg was impressed by Heim's knowledge, but thought the approach would be impractical.&lt;ref name="Ludwiger"/&gt;

At that point Heim had to do [[Armed forces|military service]] in the German air force. He sent a paper on explosives to the Chemical-Technical 'Reichsanstalt' in Berlin, whereupon he was summoned to work there on the development of the proposed new explosives. It was here that he met with the accident that handicapped him for life.&lt;ref name="Ludwiger"/&gt;

In 1946, Heim registered at the [[University of Göttingen]] to study physics. He fulfilled his academic degree requirements with the help of companions. Afterwards, he continued to study a variety of topics including medicine, [[psychology]], [[electronics]], history and [[theology]].&lt;ref name="Ludwiger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lietz"/&gt;

===1950s===
In 1952, during the third congressional session of the [[International Astronautical Federation]] (IAF) in Stuttgart, Germany, Burkhard Heim presented his theory for interplanetary propulsion under the title of “Die dynamische Kontrabarie als Lösung des astronautischen Problems” (The Dynamic Kontrabarie as solution of the Astronautical Problem).&lt;ref name="Weyla"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Weyl|first = A. R.|date = October 1957|title = Anti-gravity|journal = Aeronautics|volume = 37|number = 2|pages = 80–86|publisher = British Aviation Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the first time the idea of gravitational, electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces were treated as distortions of their proper Euclidean metrics in a higher-dimensional space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url = http://www.hpcc-space.com/publications/documents/PrinciplesOfAdvancedSpacePropulsionAIAA-paper-2002-4094.pdf|title= Physical principles of advanced space propulsion based on Heim's field theory|first1= W.|last1= Dröscher|first2 = J.|last2 = Häuser|date= July 2002|year= |conference= 38th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference &amp; Exhibit|conference-url= http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/MJPC02|id=2002-4094|publisher= [[AIAA]]|location= Indianapolis, Indiana|format= pdf|access-date= 7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A brief description of Heim’s lecture was recorded in the proceedings of the Society for Space Research.&lt;ref name="Weylb"&gt;{{cite book|last = Weyl|first = A. R.|date = January 1959|chapter = Knowledge and possibilities of gravity research|translator = W. R. Eichler|title = Weltraumfahrt; Zeitschrift für Rakententechnik|language = German|orig-year = 1958|pages = 100–106|volume = 9|id = DTIC No. AD-0830247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Weyl|first = A. R|date = February 1959|title = Gravity and the prospects for astronautics|journal = Aeronautics|volume = 59|issue = 6|pages = 16–22|publisher = British Aviation Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954 he began to study under [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]] in [[Göttingen]].&lt;ref name="Ludwiger"/&gt;  He wrote his diploma thesis on physical processes in the [[Crab Nebula]] [[Supernova]]. After this, he began to work at the [[Max Planck Institute]] for [[Astrophysics]] in Göttingen. However, he soon found it extremely difficult to work in a team due to his handicaps. Von Weizsäcker also did not want to burden Heim with the development of a unified field theory. However, this was essentially his primary interest.&lt;ref name="Ludwiger"/&gt;

Also, his second IAF presentation was given in 1954, Innsbruck, Austria, during its fifth congress.  News about his presentations may have been relayed to the United States by the American representatives, Frederick C. Durant III and Andrew G. Haley, who were serving as President and Vice President, respectively, of the IAF during its fifth congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Ley|first = W.|date = 1969|title = Rockets, Missiles, and Men in Space|pages = 587–591|location = New York, NY|publisher = Signet Books, published by The New American Library, Incorporated|lccn = 67-20676}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cisco"&gt;{{cite news|last = Cisco|first = T.

During the 1955 holiday week of [[Thanksgiving Day]], the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', and ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' carried announcements about the completion of contractual arrangements between Burkhard Heim and [[Glenn L. Martin Company]].  Heim was to assist them with their [[United States gravity control propulsion research|gravity control]] propulsion project.&lt;ref name="Talbert"&gt;{{cite news|last = Talbert|first = A. E.|date = 30 November 1955|title = Conquest of gravity aim of top scientists in U.S.|newspaper = New York Herald-Tribune|pages = 1, 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Talbert|first = A. E.|date = 30 November 1955|title = Scientists taking first steps in assault on gravity barrier|newspaper = The Miami Herald|pages = 1, 2–A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The news about Heim's contract was among several revelations that had been published during the period of intensified [[United States gravity control propulsion research (1955 - 1974)]].&lt;ref name="Talbert"/&gt;

In 1956, Heim completed a twenty-seven paged progress report.  Copies of it and its English translation were archived at the [[Gravity Research Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Heimgrav"&gt;{{cite book|last = Heim|first = B.|date = 1956|title = Bericht über die Entwicklung des Prinzips der dynamischen Kontrabarie|trans-title = A report on the development of the principle of dynamic contrabarie|language = German|location = New Boston, New Hampshire|publisher = Gravity Research Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It had summarized his philosophy (syntrometry) and his theory (Principle of Dynamic Contrabarie) for coupling general relativity with quantum dynamics for propulsion applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last = Watson|first = J. T.|date = February 1961|title = Gravitational control research|type = Master’s|id = DTIC No. AD-0253588}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sample calculations for an expedition from the surface of the Earth to the surface of the planet [[Mars]] appeared at the end of Heim’s progress report.  His six-dimensional meso-field-equations required only 285&amp;nbsp;kg of fuel to be expended to propel a manned vehicle, with the empty weight of fifty tons, on a round trip lasting only 336 hours.  Those calculations allowed 111 hours for interplanetary travel, 100 hours to explore Mars, and fourteen hours to perform engine overhaul and launch preparations.  His endothermic process required a maximum cooling rate of 1.2 GW.&lt;ref name="Heimgrav"/&gt;

In November 1957, Heim delivered a lecture about his propulsion theory to the Deutschen Gesellschaft für Raketentechnik und Raumfahrt (German Society for Rocket Technology and Space Travel), Frankfurt.&lt;ref name="Ludwiger"/&gt;  Subsequently, [[Wernher von Braun]] sought his comments on various aerospace projects.&lt;ref name="Lietz"/&gt;  According to von Ludwiger, an audiotape of Heim’s presentation had been prepared for shipment to America.&lt;ref name="Ludwiger"/&gt;

In 1959, Heim completed his first publication in the obscure German journal ''Zeitschrift für Flugkörper'' (''Magazine for Missiles'').&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Robertson|first1 = G. A.|last2 = Murad|first2 = P. A.|last3 = Davis|first3 = E.|date = 2008|title = New frontiers in space propulsion sciences|journal = Energy Conversion and Management|volume = 49|issue = 3|pages = 436–452|doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2007.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It carried a series of four articles about his theory.&lt;ref name="Heima"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Heim|first = B.|date = 1959|title = Das Prinzip der dynamischen Kontrabarie|journal = Zeitschrift für Flugkörper|language = German|volume = 1|number = 4|pages = 100–02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Heim|first = B.|date = 1959|title = Das Prinzip der dynamischen Kontrabarie (II)|journal = Zeitschrift für Flugkörper|language = German|volume = 1|number = 6|pages = 164–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Heim|first = B.|date = 1959|title = Das Prinzip der dynamischen Kontrabarie (III)|journal = Zeitschrift für Flugkörper|language = German|volume = 1|number = 7|pages = 219–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Heim|first = B.|date = 1959|title = Das Prinzip der dynamischen Kontrabarie (IV)|journal = Zeitschrift für Flugkörper|language = German|volume = 1|number = 8|pages = 244–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The series of papers carried claims and sample calculations that were similar to his 1956 progress report at the Gravity Research Foundation.  Heim discussed "the principle of the dynamic Kontrabarie" in which he examined how a field drive would be more effective than the best chemical drive for rockets. These papers remained ambiguous on the fundamental concepts underlying his theory of the field drive, likely due to the necessity to complete the calculations on the extra fields of his field theory. These calculations were not performed until a few years later.&lt;ref name="Heima"/&gt;

Heim was very mindful of keeping his work from others and worried about plagiarism.&lt;ref name="Ludwiger"/&gt;  In particular, he saw some colleagues as possible plagiarists. One other reason for his distrust of others was due to a colleague who [[embezzle]]d donations from a society he founded in 1959. (The ''Institut für Kraftfeldphysik e.V.'' was intended to develop test models of his propulsion concepts.)&lt;ref name="Ludwiger"/&gt;

Heim stopped work on the propulsion aspect of his theory in 1959.  Neither failures nor flaws had made Heim discontinue his propulsion research – it was the unbridled interest of unsavory firms.&lt;ref name="Heima"/&gt;  The preface by Helmut Goeckel to Heim’s first paper in the series of four articles published by ''Magazine for Missiles'' indicated various aerospace and ordnance companies had made several attempts to kidnap him.  Subsequently, the remainder of his life was devoted to refining the unified field attributes of his theory.&lt;ref name="Lietz"/&gt;

===1960s===
In the late 1950s and early 1960s there were a number of reports on Heim in magazines and [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]] such as ''Le Figaro'', ''Bunte Illustrierte'', ''Quick'' and ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]''. The magazine ''[[le Figaro]]'' remarked (January 15, 1969) that he was an "inhuman robot".&lt;ref name="Ludwiger"/&gt;   Also, the main German TV station, [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]], ran reports and interviews with Heim. It was speculated that Heim was likely to make a breakthrough, either in fundamental physics or propulsion theory.

On November 17, 1969, Heim, reported the progress he had made towards developing his unified field theory to [[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm]] (MBB).  [[Pascual Jordan]] and Gebhard Lyra were among the small body of scientists who attended that colloquium.  Jordan wrote Heim a letter on December 22, 1969 encouraging him to publish his theory.&lt;ref name="Ludwiger"/&gt;

===1970s===
[[Ludwig Bölkow]] encouraged Heim to enhance his theory.&lt;ref name="Lietz"/&gt;  On November 25, 1976, Heim publicly introduced, for the first time, his completed unified field theory in a presentation to MBB engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|last = Heim|first = Burkhard|translator = Jim Graham|translator2 = John Reed|date = 2008|orig-year = 1976|title = Basic Thoughts on a unified field theory of matter and gravity (Version 1.2)|url = http://www.engon.de/protosimplex/downloads/02%20heim%20-%20mbb%201.2en.pdf|event = MBB presentation|access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It included the methodology for calculating the mass spectrum of elementary particles.  Pursuant to recommendations by [[Werner Heisenberg]]’s successor, Hans-Peter Dürr, Heim published his unified field theory summary, the following year, in an article entitled Recommendations of a Way to a Unified Description of Elementary Particles in the Max Planck Institute journal ''Zeitschrift für Naturforschung''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Heim|first = B.|date = 1977|title = Vorschlag eines Weges einer einheitlichen Beschreibung der Elementarteilchen|language = German|journal = Zeitschrift für Naturforschung|volume = 23a|pages = 233–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first publication of his theory in a peer reviewed scientific journal.

===1980s===
In 1982 Heim's [[mass formula]] was programmed on a computer at the German Electron Synchrotron [[DESY]] in Hamburg with the assistance of some resident scientists.&lt;ref name="Lietz"/&gt;  Up to that point, Heim had not yet confided in other [[theoretical physicist]]s on the details of the mass formula derivation. Hence, the DESY results were not widely published and disseminated for academic scrutiny. That year [[Walter Dröscher]], a theorist at the Vienna Patent Office, began to work with Heim. The first result of their collaboration cumulated into the second volume of Heim's major work, appearing in 1984.&lt;ref name="Lietz"/&gt;

===1990s===
In 1992, Hans Theodor Auerbach and Illobrand von Ludwiger presented a summary of Heim’s unified field theory of elementary particles and their internal structures.  It contained Heim’s derivation of Sommerfeld’s [[fine structure constant]] (α&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/137.0360085) – it was a close approximation of the 1987 measured value (α = 1/137.035989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Auerbach|first1 = T.|last2 = von Ludwiger|first2 = I.|date = 1992|title = Heim’s theory of elementary particle structure|journal = Journal of Scientific Exploration|volume = 6|number = 3|pages = 217–231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
Heim died in [[Northeim]] in 2001 at age 75.

In 2004, the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] (AIAA) awarded the winning paper in the nuclear and future flight field to a retired Austrian patent officer named [[Walter Dröscher]] and Jochem Häuser, a physicist and professor of computer science at the University of Applied Sciences in Salzgitter, Germany. They turned the theoretical framework of Burkhard Heim into a proposal for an experimental test for a propulsion device that is thought to theoretically be able to travel at rates [[faster-than-light|faster than the speed of light]]. Hans Theodor Auerbach, a theoretical physicist and someone who has worked alongside Heim has stated that, "As far as I understand it, Heim theory is ingenious," and, "I think that physics will take this direction in the future".&lt;ref name="Lietz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hpcc-space.de/publications/documents/aiaa2004-3700-a4.pdf|title = Guidelines For A Space Propulsion Device Based On Heim's Quantum Theory|website = HPCC-Space GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the AIAA Nuclear and Future Flight Propulsion Technical Committee published the following statement:

::Much research was conducted this year on the investigation of the experimental basis of the existence of gravity-like fields that cannot be described by conventional gravitation; that is, by the accumulation of mass.  Investigations emphasized a geometrized approach termed Extended Heim Theory, which extends Einstein's idea of geometrization of physics by employing the additional concepts of Heim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Donahue, B. |author2=Moton-Nkhata, T. |author3=the AIAA Nuclear |author4=Future Flight Propulsion Committee  |lastauthoramp=yes |date = December 2008|title = Nuclear and future flight propulsion|journal = Aerospace America|pages = 57–59|url = http://www.hpcc-space.de/publications/documents/AerospaceAmericaAdvancedPropulsionDec2008.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and health==
Heim had to undergo a series of at least 50 operations [http://quanthomme.free.fr/energielibre/chercheurs/CHERCHEURS2.htm] after a laboratory explosion resulted in the loss of his arms. He found that intense concentration on the study of Einstein's relativity theory helped him control the pain in his arms mentally and physically.

The loss of his hands and serious diminution of his eyesight apparently resulted in Heim acquiring an [[Eidetic memory|eidetic]], acoustic memory. He was claimed to rarely forget a formula if he heard it recited, and was said to be able to learn a language in a matter of days. He married a former concert singer from [[Prague]] in 1950 named Gerda.

== Heim theory and the physics community ==
Heim achieved some media renown in the 1950s and 1960s, but his ideas have never been well-accepted in the physics community. A significant portion of Heim's work has not been published in rigorously [[peer review]]ed journals. Heim's theory also predicts the existence of two hypothetical [[neutrino]]s, which have been shown not to exist by experiments at the [[Large Electron–Positron Collider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Olaf|last = Posdzech|url = http://www.worlditc.org/f_06_protosimplex_heim_a_biography.htm|title = Burkhard Heim, a biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="L31992"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Determination of the Number of Light Neutrino Species | journal=Physics Letters B | year = 1992 | author = L3 Collaboration | volume = 292 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 463–471| id = |bibcode = 1992PhLB..292..463A |doi = 10.1016/0370-2693(92)91204-M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian Samuel Weiss''' (26 February 1780 – 1 October 1856) was a German [[mineralogist]] born in [[Leipzig]].

Following graduation, he worked as a [[physics]] instructor in Leipzig from 1803 until 1808. and in the meantime, conducted geological studies of mountain formations in [[Tyrol (region)|Tyrol]], [[Switzerland]] and [[France]] (1806–08).&lt;ref name=BE&gt;[http://www.hu-berlin.de/ueberblick/geschichte/rektoren/weiss/ Christian Samuel Weiss — Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin] biographical information&lt;/ref&gt; In 1810 he became a professor of [[mineralogy]] at the [[University of Berlin]], where in 1818/19 and 1832/33, he served as university [[rector (academia)|rector]].&lt;ref name=BE/&gt; He died near [[Cheb|Eger]] in [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]].

Weiss is credited for creating parameters of modern [[crystallography]], and was instrumental in making it a branch of mathematical science. He stressed the significance of direction in crystals, considering crystallographic [[Axis of symmetry|axes]] to be a possible basis for classification of crystals. He is credited for introducing the categorization schema of [[crystal system]]s, and has a basic law of crystallography named after him called the "Weiss zone law".

==Types of crop simulation models==

Crop simulation models have been classified into three broad categories:&lt;ref name=fao&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/ess/documents/meetings_and_workshops/GS_SAC_2013/Improving_methods_for_crops_estimates/Crop_Yield_Forecasting_Methods_and_Early_Warning_Systems_Lit_review.pdf|title = Review of Crop Yield Forecasting and Early Warning Systems|last = Basso|first = Bruno|last2 = Cammarano|first2 = David|last3 = Carfagna|first3 = Elisabetta}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0103-90161998000500008|title = Principles of crop modeling and simulation: I. uses of mathematical models in agricultural science|last= Dourado-Neto|first = D.|last2 = Teruel|first2 = D. A.|last3 = Reichart|first3 = K.|last4 = Nielsen|first4 = D. R.|last5 = Frizzone|first5 = J. A.|last6 = Bacchi|first6 = O. O. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Statistical models: These typically rely on yield information for large areas (such as counties), and identify broad trends. The two main trends identified are a secular trend of a gradual increase in crop yield, and variation based on weather conditions. Statistical models are a significant improvement over naive historical predictions, but are not preferred for very fine-grained predictions.
# Mechanistic models: These attempt to use fundamental mechanisms of plant and soil processes to simulate specific outcomes. These involve fairly detailed and computation-intensive simulations. These models use a continuous evolution and simulating them previously requires a small time step.
# Functional models: These use simplified closed functional forms to simulate complex processes. They are computationally easier than mechanistic models, and can often give results that are of only somewhat worse accuracy. The [[Penman equation]] is an example of an equation that might be used as a component of a functional model. Functional models are typically run using a daily time step and the data is updated daily.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt;

==Commonly used crop simulation models==

* [[CropSyst]], a multi-year multi-crop daily time-step crop simulation model developed by a team at [[Washington State University]]'s Department of Biological Systems Engineering.&lt;ref name=cropsyst/&gt;
* APSIM, the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator is a highly advanced simulator of agricultural systems. APSIM was created by [[CSIRO]], the State of Queensland (through its Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry) and [[University of Queensland|The University of Queensland]] in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apsim.info/ APSIM]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought to be represented as a large [[supervoid]], the ''Dipole Repeller Void''.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite magazine |title= Cosmic Void “Pushes” Milky Way |author=  Camille M. Carlisle |date= March 2017 |magazine= Sky and Telescope }} &lt;/ref&gt;

== The Repeller Dipole ==
[[File:Dipole repeller.svg|thumb|400px|Gravitational attraction induces movement towards more dense areas giving the appearance of galaxies moving away from a less dense area, the 'Dipole Repeller' model.]]

The [[Local Group]] of galaxies is moving relative to the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) at {{val|631|20|u=km/s}}.

There is also a pattern of bulk flow in the motion of neighboring galaxies extending to distances of over 250 [[megaparsecs]] (Mpc). There is a known overdensity – the [[Shapley Supercluster]] – creating an attraction in the flow of galaxies. 

Fundamentally gravitation is always attractive, but if there is an underdense region it apparently acts as a gravitational repeller.  That's because there is less attraction in the direction of the underdensity, and the greater attraction due to the higher density in other directions acts to pull objects away from the underdensity.
&lt;ref&gt;
     {{cite magazine 
     | last=Stegal | first=Ethan 
     | title=Ask Ethan: If Gravity Attracts, How Can The 'Dipole Repeller' Push The Milky Way? 
     | magazine=Forbes Magazine

     &lt;/ref&gt; 

The repeller appears to be located at a distance of about 220&amp;nbsp;Mpc and is anticipated to coincide with a void in galaxy density.

That single center of attraction along with a roughly equal single repeller appear to be the most significant contributors to the [[Cosmic microwave background#CMBR dipole anisotropy|CMB dipole]].

}}'''Emil Godlewski''' (1875–1944) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[embryologist]], professor of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]]. After early research on the development and [[histogenesis]] of muscles, professor Godlewski's scientific interests focused on regeneration and mechanisms regulating the process of fertilization, as well as early embryo development, [[blastula]]tion and [[gastrula]]tion. He was also interested in the origin of the primary differentiating cells in regenerates. He postulated the importance of epithelial tissue in this process and was the first to point out the change in the function, organization and role of the cells under the influence of external stimuli. Investigating fertilization and early development, he focused on the cooperation between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the regulation of the early stages of development. Godlewski was also the author of the theory of migration of the inherited substances from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and, after their processing, from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. His works were never fragmentary, but always synthetic attempts at explaining important issues relating to the mechanisms of development. In 1936 Professor Godlewski was awarded the title of Member of the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]]. Apart from doing research and teaching, Emil Godlewski devoted a lot of time to social issues, especially those connected to medicine. When Poland regained independence after World War I, he actively participated in the reopening of the Jagiellonian University.

Major general '''Fei Junlong''' ({{zh|s=费俊龙|t=費俊龍|p=Fèi Jùnlóng}}; born 1965) is a [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] military pilot and an [[astronaut]]. He flew on the second manned spaceflight of the [[Shenzhou spacecraft|Shenzhou program]].

He was born in [[Suzhou]], [[Jiangsu]] province of China and was recruited from high school by the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] (PLAAF) in 1982 at the age of 17.  He graduated with excellent marks from the PLAAF's No. 9 Aviation School, the Changchun No.1 Flight College of the PLA Air Force and Flight Training School of the Air Force. In the PLAAF, he was a pilot, flight trainer and flight technology inspector.

Fèi was selected for the CNSA astronaut program in 1998. He was in the final five selected for the ''[[Shenzhou 5]]'' flight. He was the commander on the ''[[Shenzhou 6]]'' flight that launched October 12, 2005, with [[Niè Hǎishèng]] serving as flight engineer). They landed on October 17, 2005.

He was married in 1991 and has one son. During his personal time he dabbles in fine arts.

The [[asteroid]] [[9512 Feijunlong]] was named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1029">In [[linguistic morphology]], '''fossilization''' refers to two close notions. One is preserving of ancient linguistic features which have lost their grammatical functions in [[language]]. Another is loss of [[Productivity (linguistics)|productivity]] of a grammatical paradigm (''e.g.'' of an [[affix]]), which still remains in use in some words.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics'', by Robert Lawrence Trask,
   Another definition of fossilization: fossilization is a process in which incorrect linguistic features become a permanent part a person speaks and writes in a language.    [https://books.google.com/books?id=EHeGzQ8wuLQC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=%22fossilized+form%22+linguistics&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ViAhkdCfBP&amp;sig=28qoQp08oJBheqA2iYc5XspXoJE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA125,M1 p. 125]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Examples of fossilization include [[Bound morpheme|fossilized morpheme]]s and [[fossil word]]s.

[[Image:Fruit tree forms at Gaasbeek.JPG|thumb|right|285px|A test site with several fruit tree forms located at [[Gaasbeek Castle]]]]

Fruit trees are grown in a variety of shapes, sometimes to please the eye but mainly to encourage fruit production. The form or shape of [[fruit trees]] can be manipulated by [[Pruning fruit trees|pruning]] and training. Shaping and promoting a particular tree form is done to establish the plant in a particular situation under certain environmental conditions, to increase fruit yield, and to enhance fruit quality. For example, pruning a tree to a [[pyramid]] shape enables trees to be planted closer together.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} An open bowl or cup form helps sunlight penetrate the canopy, thus encouraging a high fruit yield whilst keeping the tree short and accessible for harvesting.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Other shapes such as [[cordon (plant)|cordon]]s, [[espalier]]s and fans offer opportunities for growing trees two dimensionally against walls or fences, or they can be trained to function as barriers.

==Forms==
[[Image:fruittreeforms.png|right|thumb|250px]]
Some of the following fruit tree forms require training by tying the branches to the required form. Most require pruning to retain the desired structure. However, not all types of fruit tree are suitable for all forms; [[Apple (fruit)|apples]] and [[pear]]s do well as cordons and espaliers, for example, whereas cherries are more suited to the fan form.

===Bush===
An open-centred crown on a short trunk of less than {{convert|1|m}}. This is a traditional and popular form for apple trees. Bush trees are easy to maintain and bear fruit at a young age. Final height is between {{convert|2|m}} and {{convert|5.5|m}}, depending on which [[rootstock]] is used.&lt;ref name=Hessayon&gt;[[Hessayon, Dr D. G.]], ''The Fruit Expert'', Transworld Publishers Ltd, 1997, p10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard===
Larger than the bush form, with trunks of {{convert|2|m}} or more. Standard trees can reach a total height of {{convert|8|m}}. They eventually produce high yields but, being large trees, are not easy to maintain.&lt;ref name=Hessayon/&gt;

===Pyramid===
Similar to the bush form, although the main leader shoot is allowed to maintain its dominance, resulting in a pyramidal shape.

===Spindlebush===
A variant of the pyramid form in which the lateral branches are tied down to a horizontal position. 
Designed for dense orchards by [[Otto Schmitz-Hübsch]] and Heinrichs in Germany in 1936, this is currently the most popular training system for dwarf apple and pear trees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actahort.org/books/322/322_3.htm spindlebush fruit tree form]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cordon===
Single-stemmed trees planted at an angle (usually 45°), with [[fruiting spur]]s encouraged to form along the stem. Any side branches are removed by pruning. Cordons take less space and crop earlier than most other forms, so more varieties can be grown in a given space, but yields are smaller per tree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brogdale.org/choosetreeforms.html Main fruit tree forms]&lt;/ref&gt; A special cordon set-up is the Bouché-Thomas system.

===Espalier===
A central vertical trunk with three or four horizontal branches on each side. A special espalier in this group is the LePage-system.

===Fan===
A short central trunk with several radiating branches growing from the crown.

===Step-over espalier===
Espaliers with just one tier of horizontal branches 30&amp;nbsp;cm from the ground. These make a novel and productive border for a vegetable plot.

A study on orchard mango trees in [[Nelspruit]], [[South Africa]], compared open vase, closed vase, central leader, palmette and standard pruning systems and recommended a modified pyramid, somewhere between a central leader and a closed vase system, for high-density mango orchards. The study also evaluated both post-fruit-set and post-harvest pruning, indicating that late mango cultivars benefit from pruning while bearing in late fall, while early cultivars may be best pruned immediately after harvest.&lt;ref name=Stassen&gt;

'''John Castagnini''' (born December 3, 1970) is an [[ontology|ontologist]], public speaker on [[consciousness]], and publisher of the best-selling "Thank God I" series of self-help books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thank God I Series|url=http://johncastagnini.com/?p=762|website=johncastagnini.com|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an awesome network marketer with Global Prosperity.

Castagnini has appeared in several movies, including the spiritual documentary ''Discover the Gift'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discover the Gift|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1445206/|website=IMDB|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-starring with spiritual leaders [[Dalai Lama|The Dalai Lama]] and [[Ravi Shankar (spiritual leader)|Sri Sri Ravi Shankar]], as well as international relationship author [[Barbara De Angelis]].

== Biography ==
Born in [[Canarsie, Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] as the eldest of three sons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Contributors|url=https://business-intelligence-success-347bf0.booki.sh/rud_9780470488409_oeb_ata_r1.html|website=Business Intelligence Success|accessdate=18 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118163925/https://business-intelligence-success-347bf0.booki.sh/rud_9780470488409_oeb_ata_r1.html|archivedate=18 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castagnini obtained a B.A degree in [[Biology]] from [[Cal-State Fullerton]].  Prompted by the death of his mother in 2005, Castagnini went on to found the "ThankGodi" publication, which focuses on methods of "equilibration" as a means to come to terms with traumatic personal events, and features well known authors [[John Frederick Demartini|John Demartini]], [[Wayne Dyer|Dr. Wayne Dyer]] and [[Bernie S. Siegel|Dr. Bernie Seigel]].  The experiences that contributed to this approach of counselling were detailed in the documentary ''Discover the Gift'', and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] show ''A View from the Bay'' with [[Spencer Christian]].

'''Kitti's hog-nosed bat''' (''Craseonycteris thonglongyai''), also known as the '''bumblebee bat''', is a [[vulnerable species]] of [[bat]] and the only extant member of the family '''Craseonycteridae'''. It occurs in western [[Thailand]] and southeast [[Myanmar]], where it occupies [[limestone]] caves along rivers.

Kitti's hog-nosed bat is the smallest species of bat and arguably the world's [[Smallest organisms#Mammals|smallest mammal]]. It has a reddish-brown or grey coat, with a distinctive pig-like snout. Colonies range greatly in size, with an average of 100 individuals per cave. The bat feeds during short activity periods in the evening and dawn, foraging around nearby forest areas for insects. Females give birth annually to a single offspring.

Although the bat's status in Myanmar is not well known, the Thai population is restricted to a single province and may be at risk for extinction. Its potential threats are primarily anthropogenic, and include habitat degradation and the disturbance of roosting sites.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Kitti's hog-nosed bat Stuffed specimen.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Stuffed specimen at the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]].]]
Kitti's hog-nosed bat is about {{convert|abbr=on|29|to|33|mm|in}} in length and {{convert|abbr=on|2|g|oz}} in mass.&lt;ref&gt;Donati, Annabelle, and Pamela Johnson. "Which mammal is the smallest?."

It is the smallest species of bat and may be the world's smallest mammal, depending on how size is defined. The main competitors for the title are small [[shrew]]s; in particular, the [[Etruscan shrew]] may be lighter at {{convert|abbr=on|1.2|to|2.7|g|oz}} but is longer, measuring {{convert|abbr=on|36|to|53|mm|in}} from its head to the base of the tail.&lt;ref name=MammalSociety&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.abdn.ac.uk/mammal/smallest.shtml | title = Mammal record breakers: The smallest! | work = The Mammal Society | accessdate = 2008-04-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070713081111/http://www.abdn.ac.uk/mammal/smallest.shtml |archivedate = July 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Range and distribution==
Kitti's hog-nosed bat occupies limestone caves along rivers within dry [[evergreen]] or [[deciduous]] forests.&lt;ref name=Edge/&gt; In Thailand, Kitti's hog-nosed bat is restricted to a small region of the [[Tenasserim Hills]] in [[Sai Yok District]], [[Kanchanaburi Province]], within the [[drainage basin]] of the [[Khwae Noi River]].&lt;ref name=Edge/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oryx&gt;{{cite journal|title=Status of the world's smallest mammal, the bumble-bee bat ''Craseonycteris thonglongyai'', in Myanmar|journal=Oryx|date=October 2006|last=MJR Pereira|volume=40|issue=4|pages=456–463|doi=10.1017/S0030605306001268|first1=Maria João Ramos|last2=Rebelo|first2=Hugo|last3=Teeling|first3=Emma C.|last4=O'Brien|first4=Stephen J.|last5=MacKie|first5=Iain|last6=Bu|first6=Si Si Hla|last7=Swe|first7=Khin Maung|last8=Khin|first8=Mie Mie|last9=Bates|first9=Paul J.J. |author-separator=|displayauthors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Sai Yok National Park]] in the [[Dawna Hills]] contains much of the bat's range, some Thai populations occur outside the park and are therefore unprotected.&lt;ref name=Edge/&gt;

Since the 2001 discovery of a single individual in Myanmar, at least nine separate sites have been identified in the limestone outcrops of the Dawna and [[Karen Hills]] outside the [[Salween River|Thanlwin]], [[Ataran River|Ataran]], and [[Gyaing River]]s of [[Kayin State|Kayin]] and [[Mon State]]s.&lt;ref name=Oryx/&gt; The Thai and Myanmar populations are [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] identical, but their [[animal echolocation|echolocation]] calls are distinct.&lt;ref name=Oryx/&gt; It is not known whether the two populations are [[Reproductive isolation|reproductively isolated]].&lt;ref name=Oryx/&gt;

==Behaviour==
Kitti's hog-nosed bat roosts in caves in limestone hills, far from the entrance. While many caves contain only 10 to 15 individuals, the average group size is 100, with a maximum of about 500. Individuals roost high on walls or roof domes, far apart from each other.&lt;ref name=IUCNpdf/&gt; Bats also undertake seasonal migration between caves.

Kitti's hog-nosed bat has a brief activity period, leaving its roost for only 30 minutes in the evening and 20 minutes at dawn. These short flights are easily interrupted by heavy rain or cold temperatures.&lt;ref name=IUCNpdf&gt;Hutson, A. M., Mickleburgh, S. P. and Racey, P. A. (Compilers). 2001. [http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/actionplans/microchiropteranbats/microchiroptera.html Microchiropteran Bats: Global Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan]. IUCN/SSC Chiroptera Specialist Group. IUCN: Gland, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the bat forages within fields of [[cassava]] and [[Kapok tree|kapok]] or around the tops of [[bamboo]] clumps and [[teak]] trees, within one kilometre of the roosting site.&lt;ref name=Edge/&gt;&lt;ref name=IUCNpdf/&gt; The wings seem to be shaped for hovering flight, and the gut contents of specimens include spiders and insects that are presumably gleaned off foliage. Nevertheless, most prey is probably caught in flight.&lt;ref name=IUCNpdf/&gt; Main staples of the bat's diet include small [[fly|flies]] ([[Chloropidae]], [[Agromyzidae]], and [[Anthomyiidae]]), [[hymenoptera]]ns, and [[psocoptera]]ns.&lt;ref name=IUCNpdf/&gt;

Late in the dry season (around April) of each year, females give birth to a single offspring. During feeding periods, the young either stays in the roost or remains attached to the mother at one of her two [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] pubic nipples.&lt;ref name=AnimalDiversity/&gt;&lt;ref name=IUCNpdf/&gt;

==Taxonomy==
Kitti's hog-nosed bat is the only extant species in the family Craseonycteridae, which is grouped in the superfamily Rhinolophoidea as a result of molecular testing. Based on this determination, the bat's closest relatives are members of the families [[Hipposideridae]] and [[Rhinopomatidae]].&lt;ref name=Chipterologica/&gt;

Kitti's hog-nosed bat was unknown to the world at large prior to 1974. Its common name refers to its discoverer, Thai zoologist [[Kitti Thonglongya]]. Thonglongya worked with a British partner, [[John Edward Hill|John E. Hill]], in classifying bats of Thailand; after Thonglongya died suddenly in February 1974, Hill formally described the species, giving it the binomial name ''Craseonycteris thonglongyai'' in honour of his colleague.&lt;ref name=Mammalian&gt;{{cite journal|title=Craseonycteris thonglongyai|journal=Mammalian Species|date=1981-12-03|author=J. E. Hill|author2=Susan E. Smith|last-author-amp=yes|volume=160|pages=1–4|doi=10.2307/3503984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JoM&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kitti Thonglongya, 1928-1974|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|date=February 1975|last=Schlitter|first=Duane A.|volume=56|issue=1|pages=279–280|doi=10.2307/1379641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
As of the species' most recent review in 2008, Kitti's hog-nosed bat is listed by the [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]] as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]], with a downward population trend.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

Soon after the bat's discovery in the 1970s, some roosting sites became disturbed as a result of tourism, scientific collection, and even the collection and sale of individuals as souvenirs. However, these pressures may not have had a significant effect on the species as a whole, since many small colonies exist in hard-to-access locations, and only a few major caves were disturbed. Another potential risk is the activity of local monks, who have occupied roost caves during periods of meditation.&lt;ref name=IUCNpdf/&gt;

Currently, the most significant and long-term threat to the Thai population could be the annual burning of forest areas, which is most prevalent during the bat's breeding season. In addition, the proposed construction of a pipeline from Myanmar to Thailand may have a negative impact.&lt;ref name=IUCNpdf/&gt; Threats to the Myanmar population are not well known.&lt;ref name=Edge/&gt;

In 2007, Kitti's hog-nosed bat was identified by the [[EDGE Species|Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered]] &lt;!-- (EDGE) --&gt; project as one of its Top 10 "focal species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Protection for 'weirdest' species | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6263331.stm | date = 2007-01-16 | accessdate = 2007-05-22 | work = [[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WWF Malaysia website, retrieved 14 December 2008 {{cite web|url=http://www.wwf.org.my/how_you_can_help/how_you_live_your_life/hylyl_travel_smart/index.cfm?uNewsID%3D2020 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224034714/http://www.wwf.org.my/how_you_can_help/how_you_live_your_life/hylyl_travel_smart/index.cfm?uNewsID=2020 |archivedate=24 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre is an important refuge and feeding ground for many species of resident birds, as well as several migratory bird species from Northern Asia.  In addition, it is a breeding ground for marine life protected by the Fishery Department of Sabah.

Apart from providing shelter and food for both resident and migratory species of wildlife, [[wetlands]] also prevent salt build-up in surrounding freshwater supplies, stabilising sedimentation, storing nutrients and removing toxins.

==Wildlife==
Birds from around the globe, including non-breeding winter visitors, are commonly sighted at the sanctuary, especially during migratory season of Asian birds (i.e. Sept-April).

;Common visitors
*[[Little egret]], a winter visitor to Borneo;
*[[Striated heron]], a winter visitor from the mainland of Asia;
*[[White-winged tern]], a common migrant and winter visitor throughout [[Greater Sunda Islands]]
*[[Black-crowned night-heron]], a non-breeding visitor to Sumatra and North Borneo;
*[[White-breasted waterhen]], a common resident;
*[[Marsh sandpiper]], a winter visitor from [[Siberia]] and [[China]];
*[[Common moorhen]], a common breeding bird in marshy environments and well-vegetated lakes outside [[Antarctica]] and [[Australasia]];
*[[Cinnamon bittern]], a breeding bird in tropical [[Asia]], some northern birds migrate in short distances;
*[[Common redshank]], a widespread breeding bird across [[Europe]] and [[northern Asia]];

;Rare sightings
*[[Lesser adjutant|Lesser adjutant stork]], a resident breeder in [[Southern Asia]];
*[[Nankeen night heron]]

;Year-round residents
*[[Crested myna]]
*[[Yellow-vented bulbul]]
*[[Yellow-bellied prinia]]
*[[Magpie robin]]
*[[Pacific swallow]]
*[[Spotted dove]]
*[[Collared kingfisher]]
*[[Purple heron]]
*[[Green pigeon]]s

Other mangrove wildlife includes [[monitor lizard]]s, [[fiddler crab]]s, [[mudskipper]]s, [[weaver ant]]s, [[butterflies]] and other insects, [[jellyfish]], [[Enhydris|water snakes]] and [[Thalassinidea|mud lobster]]s.

'''Learning about Forests''' (LEAF) is one of the five programs run by the [[Foundation for Environmental Education]] (FEE), a [[non-governmental organization]] located in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. LEAF aims to encourage school classes and teachers to use [[forests]] for educational activities. The ''vision'' is to see an increased level of awareness and knowledge the key role the forest plays on our planet. The program's ''mission'' is to spread [[environmental education]] concerning forests and all their values among school children all around the world.

==Member organizations==
In August 2013, LEAF was composed of twenty-one organizations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEAF Member Organi[z]ations|url=http://www.leaf-international.org/Side.cfm?ID_kanal=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Birds by population sidebar}}
This is a '''list of Anseriformes species by global population'''. While numbers are estimates, they have been made by the experts in their fields.

[[Anseriformes]] (Anser being Latin for ''"goose"'') is the taxonomic order to which the [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]], [[swan]]s, and [[screamer]]s belong. [[BirdLife International]] has assessed 166 species; 89 (54% of total species) have had their population estimated. A variety of methods are used for counting waterfowl. For example, in North America, national and sub-national agencies use planes and helicopters to make [[Transect|aerial transect]]s of breeding populations, and extrapolate these counts over the species' known ranges. Methodologies are continuously being refined; thus estimates can be expected to become more accurate over time. Forecasts can be made by studying habitat condition trends and by interviewing local experts.&lt;ref name='waterfowl pop status 2012'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/NewReportsPublications/PopulationStatus/Waterfowl/StatusReport2012_final.pdf | title = Waterfowl Population Status, 2012 | accessdate = 2012-12-23 | author = [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] | date = 20 July 2012 | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more information on how these estimates were ascertained, see Wikipedia's articles on [[population biology]] and [[population ecology]].

The first bird in this list, the [[crested shelduck]], retains a status of [[Critically Endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] but may in fact be extinct. The last confirmed reporting was in 1964 near [[Vladivostok]]. [[North Korea]] claimed a sighting in March 1971, but this record is highly suspect. Unconfirmed reports do, however, periodically roll in from [[Northeast China]], giving scientists hope that the last individual has not yet died.&lt;ref name='Tadorna cristata IUCN'/&gt;
To be assessed as Critically Endangered a species must have experienced a decline of at least 80% in the past ten years or three generations, or be projected to decline that much in the future ten years or three generations.&lt;ref name='Critical criteria'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/categories_criteria_3_1#critical | title = V.

[[File:Llnl 03.jpg|thumb|right|One of the two yin-yang mirrors arrives at LLNL. The plasma was confined in the small area between the two magnets.]]

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:This is a artistic rendering of the MFTF.jpg|thumbnail|An artistic rendering of the MFTF]] --&gt;
The '''Mirror Fusion Test Facility''', or '''MFTF''', was an experimental [[magnetic confinement fusion]] device built using the tandem [[magnetic mirror]] design. It was, by far, the largest, most powerful and most expensive mirror machine ever constructed. Due to budget cuts, it was [[wikt:mothball|mothballed]] the day after its construction was complete, and sat unused for a year before being formally cancelled. $372 million dollars were spent on the system during its lifetime.

MFTF was the ultimate development of a series of machines at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL) that trace their history back to the early 1950s. Over the years one problem after another had been addressed, leading to designs using "baseball" and "yin-yang" mirrors. By the late 1960s, it appeared possible to build stable mirrors. However, these changes had also lowered their economic performance, to the point where they appeared unattractive as power generators. A new concept introduced in the early 1970s, the [[tandem mirror]], appeared to offer a way forward.

In 1968 the Soviets demonstrated their [[tokamak]] systems were outperforming all others by a factor of at least ten times. The path to practical fusion appeared open, and in the US, [[Robert L. Hirsch|Robert Hirsch]] began plans to produce a prototype power plant using the tokamak design. Having secured a massive budget increase, and desiring a second design in case the tokamak didn't pan out, a study of the alternative concepts suggested the best developed was the tandem mirror, and the MFTF concept was born. A smaller version, the [[Tandem Mirror Experiment]] (TMX), was also funded to test the basic layout.

Construction of MFTF and TMX began in 1977. TMX was much smaller and easier to build than MFTF, and began operations in 1979. By the early 1980s, TMX was beginning to demonstrate serious problems that suggested MFTF would not work as predicted. This was occurring around the same time that [[Ronald Reagan]] declared that the energy crisis was over. In a series of sweeping budget cuts across the entire energy research field, MFTF had its operational budget cancelled, although its construction budget survived. Construction completed in 1986, and the facility sat unused for a year being scavenged for parts by other researchers until it was formally cancelled in 1987 and disassembled.

== History ==
It was designed and built at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), one of the primary research centers for mirror fusion devices. It cost 372 million dollars to construct, making it at the time the most expensive project in the lab's history.  It opened on February 21, 1986 and was promptly shut down. The reason given was to balance the [[United States federal budget]].&lt;ref name=Booth1987&gt;{{cite journal |author=Booth, William. |title="Fusion's $372-Million Mothball." |journal=Science [New York City] 9 Oct. 1987, Volume 238 ed.: 152-55. Print. |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/238/4824/152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following on from the earlier Baseball II device, the facility was originally a similar system in which the confinement area was located between two horseshoe-shaped "mirrors".  

During construction the success of the [[Tandem Mirror Experiment]] ("TMX") led to a redesign to insert a [[solenoid]] area between two such magnets, dramatically improving confinement time from a few milliseconds to over one second.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980EnTR.....R...1 The Tandem Mirror Fusion Test Facility]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the fusion power would be produced in the long solenoid. The yin-yang magnets would then serve only to dam up the ends in order to maintain good plasma confinement in the solenoid. Limited to break-even energy balance, the magnetic mirror endcaps consumed power, but much less than that produced in a solenoid of sufficient length. 

A new version, officially MFTF-B, started construction in 1977 and was completed in 1986 on the very day the project was canceled. No experiments were performed. Rollbacks in fusion research funding dramatically reduced funding levels across the entire field.

== Legacy ==
Parts of the MFTF have since been re-used on newer fusion experiments, one of which won a recycling award.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eh.doe.gov/p2/p2awards/nomination_view_jsp.asp?site=OAK&amp;year=2002&amp;docNumber=1 Re-using MFTF parts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006052455/https://www.eh.doe.gov/p2/p2awards/nomination_view_jsp.asp?site=OAK&amp;year=2002&amp;docNumber=1 |date=2006-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6708">The '''Moredun Research Institute''' is a scientific research institution based at the '''Pentlands Science Park''', in the [[Bush Estate]] area of [[Midlothian]], Scotland. It conducts research into [[Veterinary pathology|diseases of farm livestock]] and the promotion of [[animal health]] and [[Animal welfare|welfare]].

Moredun employs over 200 [[Veterinarian|vets]], scientists and support staff, that are funded primarily by the [[Agriculture, Food and Rural Communities Directorate]] of the [[Scottish Government]]. The Institute received [[Pound sterling|£]]7.1 million from the government in 2010-11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/public-bodies/about/Bodies National Public Bodies Directory], the Scottish Government&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The '''Animal Diseases Research Association''', now the registered charity the '''Moredun Foundation''', was founded in 1920 by a group of Scottish farmers, with the aim of improving the health of livestock, especially [[Sheep farming|sheep]]. The association founded a research institute employing vets and scientists, and over the decades the scope of animal health work expanded to cover goats, cows, horses and wildlife.

The Institute was originally based at [[Moredun]], in Edinburgh.

The origins of Moredun go back to the years following World War I which saw an increased demand for home grown food and a significant rise in the market value of livestock. This emphasised the seriousness of the losses associated with disease and concerned farmers voiced their strong support for an organised body to conduct research into livestock diseases. In the 1920s Louping Ill and Braxy claimed almost a third of the lambs born in Scotland and Grass Sickness was having a devastating effect on horses, which were used for heavy labour on farms at that time. In March 1920 a group of enlightened Scottish farmers held a public meeting at the Highland and Agricultural Society’s chambers in Edinburgh and the Animal Diseases Research Association (now known as The Moredun Foundation) was formed. Within six years the founder members had raised enough funds to buy a plot of land and build the Moredun Research Institute. Within ten years of the Research Institute opening, Moredun scientists had discovered the cause and developed vaccines and treatment strategies for Braxy and lamb dysentery. Scientists then went on to solve the mystery of Louping Ill which was found to be caused by a virus transmitted by ticks and a vaccine was soon developed.

By the 1940s over half a million doses of vaccine and treatment products were produced and distributed by Moredun. Research gained momentum and further funding was secured to find out the causes of many different diseases such as: scrapie, pine, milk fever, Johne’s disease and a range of respiratory and reproductive disorders. Vaccines, diagnostics and treatment strategies followed. Today, many of the veterinary medicines and vaccines that are routinely used on farms have been researched, developed or tested at Moredun. This research is vital – 17% of the value of the UK sheep industry is lost each year due to infectious diseases. Subclinical infections of gut parasites are estimated to cost the UK sheep industry over £84 million a year in lost production. Enzootic abortion in ewes is thought to cost the UK sheep industry £15 million a year and Johne’s disease costs the UK cattle industry £13 million a year. Ninety years on, and still governed by farmers, Moredun’s mission to improve animal health and welfare remains strong and Moredun continues to apply cutting edge science and technology to help protect both livestock and people, today and tomorrow.

==Pentlands Science Park==
The Pentlands Science Park opened in 1995. It is part of the '''Moredun Group''', under the control of the Moredun Foundation. It is a [[public-private partnership]]. The Pentlands Science Park and Moredun are participants in the [[Edinburgh Science Triangle]] project.

In addition to being the home of the Moredun Research Institute, the science park has attracted 20 companies to the site. The focus of Pentlands Science Park is [[animal bioscience]] but the tenants include research companies involved in [[pharmaceuticals]], [[software]], and [[environmental science]]. The area occupied by non-Moredun organisations is approximately 55,000 [[sq ft]], and these tenants employ over 200 people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7358">"'''Not Censorship But Selection'''" is a 1953 article written by [[Lester Asheim]]. It was initially published in the ''[[Wilson Library Bulletin]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asheim|first=Lester|title=Not Censorship But Selection|journal=Wilson Library Bulletin|date=September 1953|volume=28|pages=63-67}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been influential in library professional standards relating to censorship and collection development. The full text of the article currently resides on the website of the [[American Library Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Asheim|first=Lester|url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/NotCensorshipButSelection|title=Not Censorship But Selection|publisher=American Library Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
This seminal 1953 article on the difference between censorship and selection in libraries influenced later thought and formed the cornerstone of many intellectual freedom documents.

==Summary==
In the first section of the article Asheim goes over the difference of censorship of a book by the law or by a town, versus the choice of a librarian not to select something for her library.  He states that the librarian is not censoring because she is making a choice that only affects her specific institution, whereas the choice the censors are making affect an entire town or nation.  The librarian is not saying that the book cannot be circulated, only that she is not going to circulate it.  Patrons are still able to get it elsewhere.

Asheim then brings up the question of limited control.  He wonders if limited control, which the librarian has when choosing not to select a book, is any different from the limited control of the local pressure group.  He then concludes that it is different because the reasons and motives behind the choice are different.  He also believes that the patron who is being denied the book is affected differently depending on the intent of the person who is choosing to limit the book.  Asheim makes the analogy of the difference between someone’s leg being amputated by a doctor who is doing it because it is necessary, versus a leg being amputated by someone who is psychotic and is doing it because of a sick compulsion.  The man who has had his leg amputated by the psychotic knows the difference and is affected differently than if a doctor had done it out of a need to help his patient.

Because it is a physical impossibility to make all books equally accessible, selection by librarians is necessary. Asheim writes that some of the standards that librarians use for selecting books are the same standards that censors use to ban books.  For example, it is valid to use the intent of the author as a selection standard, however it can also be used to ban a book in which it is decided that the author's intent is pornographic or treasonable. The standards are subjective.  Therefore, the difference between selection and censorship is found in the way the standards are applied.

Asheim argues that the main difference between a selector and a censor is in their approach: the selector's is positive, the censor's is negative. The selector, seeking to preserve, looks to find reasons to keep a book.  The censor, seeking to ban, looks for reasons to reject a book.  Asheim says that the negative approach makes it inevitable that a book will be judged not in its wholeness but by isolated parts.  He writes that the selector's positive approach is demonstrated by the diversity of a library's collection that makes as much as possible accessible to patrons.  Further, he believes that the frequency of challenges to library holdings is in itself a testament to the difference between selection and censorship.

He writes that the censor uses external criteria to judge a book; for instance, the author's life may be examined and used as a way to reject a work.  The selector, on the other hand, uses internal values and judges a book by its own merit. He calls selection democratic and censorship authoritarian.  Finally, Asheim reminds that the confidence the public has in librarians is an earned confidence that can only be kept by staying true to the profession's ideals.  And one of these ideals is maintaining the essential difference between selection and censorship.

==Influence==
Asheim's article has influenced many in the library profession and authors continue to cite it when responding to the changing censorship landscape.  In 2002, Tony Doyle drew upon Asheim's article to talk about censorship in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doyle|first1=Tony|title=Selection Versus Censorship in Libraries|journal=Collection Management|date=2002|volume=27|issue=1|pages=15-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and June Pinnell-Stephens argued that Asheim's censorship/selection distinction is useful for understanding collection development and censorship in the digital age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinnell-Stephens|first1=June|title=Lester Asheim in Cyberspace: a Tribute to Sound Reasoning|journal=American Libraries|date=2002|volume=33|issue=9|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been argued that the dichotomy of "censorship" and "selection" has the effect of [[othering]] the censor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kidd|first1=Kenneth|title=“Not Censorship but Selection”: Censorship and/as Prizing|journal=Children's Literature in Education|date=2 December 2008|volume=40|issue=3|pages=197–216|doi=10.1007/s10583-008-9078-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Rickey Best cited Asheim in an article portraying [[academic libraries]] as bastions of intellectual freedom for maintaining access to materials that were frequently challenged in public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Best |first=Rickey|title=Censorship or Selection? Academic Library Holdings Of the Top Ten Most Challenged Books of 2007|journal=Education Libraries|date=2012|volume=33|issue=2|pages=18-35.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reappraisal==
In 1983, Asheim wrote a reappraisal of his own article to address the changing tactics of censors and to challenge the persistent assumption that librarians select materials based primarily on their personal tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asheim|first1=Lester|title=Selection and Censorship: a Reappraisal|journal=Wilson Library Bulletin|date=1983|volume=58|pages=180-184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Asheim characterizes groups such as the [[Moral Majority]] as having recently (at the time of his writing) switched from attempting to have objectionable books removed to attempting to have books they approved of included to such an extent that the library's collection would be skewed to their perspective. In response, Asheim further emphasizes that segments of the library's patron base should not be allowed to impede each other's rights, and that the job of the librarian is to make selection choices with the library's entire community in mind. He also upholds his prior assertion that the best response to the problem of access is to add ideas rather than to remove them.

In [[quantum mechanics]], the '''Planck time''' ({{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;}}) is the [[unit of time]] in the system of [[natural units]] known as [[Planck units]]. A Planck unit is the [[time]] required for [[light]] to travel in a [[vacuum]] a distance of  1 [[Planck length]], which is approximately 5.39 × 10 &lt;sup&gt;−44&lt;/sup&gt; s.&lt;ref name="gsu_hbase"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/planck.html | title = Big Bang models back to Planck time | publisher = [[Georgia State University]] | date = 19 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit is named after [[Max Planck]], who was the first to propose it.

The Planck time is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?plkt CODATA Value: Planck Time] – The [[NIST]] Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t_\mathrm{P} \equiv \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^5}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:{{math|&lt;var&gt;ħ&lt;/var&gt;}} = {{frac|&lt;var&gt;h&lt;/var&gt;|2&lt;var&gt;{{pi}}&lt;/var&gt;}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]] (sometimes {{mvar|h}} is used instead of {{mvar|ħ}} in the definition&lt;ref name="gsu_hbase" /&gt;)
:{{mvar|G}} = [[gravitational constant]]
:{{mvar|c}} = [[speed of light]] in [[vacuum]]

Using the known values of the constants, the approximate equivalent value in terms of the [[SI]] unit, the [[second]], is
:&lt;math&gt; 1 \ t_\mathrm{P} \approx 5.391\,16(13) \times 10^{-44}\ \mathrm{s},&lt;/math&gt;
where the two digits between parentheses denote the [[Standard error (statistics)|standard error]] of the approximated value.

==History ==
The Planck time (also known as Planck second) was first suggested by [[Max Planck]]&lt;ref&gt;M. Planck. Naturlische Masseinheiten. Der Koniglich Preussischen Akademie Der Wissenschaften, p. 479, 1899&lt;/ref&gt; in 1899. He suggested that there existed some fundamental natural units for [[length]], [[mass]], [[time]] and [[energy]]. Planck derived these using [[dimensional analysis]] only using what he considered the most fundamental universal constants: the speed of light, the Newton gravitational constant and the Planck constant. The Planck time is by many physicists considered to be the shortest possible measurable time interval; however, this is still a matter of debate.

==Physical significance==
The Planck time is the unique combination of the [[gravitational constant]] {{mvar|G}}, the [[speed of light|special-relativistic constant]] {{mvar|c}}, and the [[Planck constant|quantum constant]] {{mvar|ħ}}, to produce a constant with dimension of [[time]]. Because the Planck time comes from dimensional analysis, which ignores constant factors, there is no reason to believe that exactly one unit of Planck time has any special physical significance. Rather, the Planck time represents a rough time scale at which quantum gravitational effects are likely to become important. This essentially means that whilst smaller units of time can exist, they are so small their effect on our existence is negligible. The nature of those effects, and the exact time scale at which they would occur, would need to be derived from an actual theory of [[quantum gravity]].

The [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the Planck time, which is [[Planck frequency]], can be interpreted as an upper bound on the frequency of a [[wave]]. This follows from the interpretation of the [[Planck length]] as a minimal length, and hence a lower bound on the wavelength.

All scientific experiments and human experiences occur over time scales that are dozens of orders of magnitude longer than the Planck time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |title=[[How the Universe Works#Season 3|How The Universe Works 3]]|episode=First Second of the Big Bang |network=Discovery Science |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; making any events happening at the Planck scale undetectable with current scientific knowledge. {{As of|2016|11}}, the smallest time interval uncertainty in direct measurements is on the order of 850 [[Orders of magnitude (time)|zeptoseconds]] (8.50 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; seconds)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-measure-the-smallest-fragment-of-time-ever-witness-an-electron-escaping-an-atom|title=Scientists have measured the smallest fragment of time ever|last=|first=|date=2010-05-12|website=|publisher=|accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Deep neural networks|Deep Neural Networks]] built on a tape-based autodiff system

==PyTorch Tensors==

In terms of programming, Tensors can simply be considered multidimensional arrays. Tensors in PyTorch are similar to [[NumPy]] arrays, with the addition being that Tensors can also be used on a GPU that supports [[CUDA]]. PyTorch supports various types of Tensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/02/pytorch-tutorial/ |title=An Introduction to PyTorch – A Simple yet Powerful Deep Learning Library |website=analyticsvidhya.com |accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modules==
===Autograd Module===

PyTorch uses a technique called automatic differentiation. A recorder records what operations have performed, and then it replays it backward to compute our gradients. This technique is especially powerful when building neural networks in order to save time on one epoch by calculating differentiation of the parameters at the forward pass itself.

===Optim Module===

torch.optim is a module that implements various optimization algorithms used for building neural networks. Most of the commonly used methods are already supported, so there is no need to build them from scratch

===nn Module===

PyTorch autograd makes it easy to define computational graphs and take gradients, but raw autograd can be a bit too low-level for defining complex neural networks. This is where the nn module can help.

A '''retort pouch''' or '''retortable pouch''' is a type of [[food packaging]] made from a [[laminate]] of flexible plastic and metal foils. It allows the sterile packaging of a wide variety of [[food and drink]] handled by [[aseptic processing]], and is used as an alternative to traditional industrial [[canning]] methods. Packaged foods range from [[water]] to fully cooked, thermo-stabilized (heat-treated) high-caloric (1,300 kcal on average) [[meal]]s such as [[Meals, Ready-to-Eat]] (MREs) which can be eaten cold, warmed by submersing in hot water, or through the use of a [[flameless ration heater]], a meal component introduced by the military in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Combat Index, “Meals Ready to Eat.” http://www.combatindex.com/.

[[camping food]], [[instant noodles]], and brands such as [[Capri Sun]] and [[Tasty Bite]].

Some varieties have a bottom [[gusset]] and are known as Stand-Up Pouches.

==Origin==
The retort pouch was invented by the [[United States Army Natick R&amp;D Command]], [[Reynolds Metals Company]], and [[Continental Flexible Packaging]], who jointly received the [[Food Technology Industrial Achievement Award]] for its invention in 1978.&lt;ref name=award&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0UQX/is_2_68/ai_114001368 (Food &amp; Drug Packaging) Retort pouches build up steam: big food companies are taking advantage of technical advances to bring out retorted products in flexible material - Technology: retort packaging]
{{ref|award}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retortable pouches are extensively used by the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]] for [[field ration]]s (called ''[[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|Meals, Ready-to-Eat]]'', or ''MREs'').

==Construction==
A retort pouch is constructed from a flexible metal-plastic laminate that is able to withstand the thermal processing used for [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]]. The food is first prepared, either raw or cooked, and then sealed into the retort pouch. The pouch is then heated to 240-250°F (116-121°C) for several minutes under high pressure inside a [[retort]] or [[autoclave]] machine. The food inside is cooked in a similar way to [[pressure cooking]]. This process reliably kills all commonly occurring [[microorganism]]s (particularly ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]''), preventing it from [[Food spoilage|spoiling]]. The packaging process is very similar to [[canning]], except that the package itself is flexible. The lamination structure does not allow permeation of gases from outside into the pouch. The retort pouch construction varies from one application to another, as a liquid product needs different barrier properties than a dry product, and similarly an [[acidic]] product needs different chemical resistance than a [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] product. Some different plastic layers used in retort pouches include:

* [[polyester]] (PET) &amp;ndash; provides a gloss and rigid layer, may be printed inside
* [[nylon]] (bi-oriented [[polyamide]]) &amp;ndash; provides puncture resistance
* [[aluminum]] (Al) &amp;ndash; provides a very thin but effective gas barrier
* food-grade cast [[polypropylene]] (CPP) &amp;ndash; used as the sealing layer
* [[polyethylene]] (PE) &amp;ndash; can be used instead of [[polypropylene|PP]] as a sealing and bonding layer

This multi-layer structure prevents the retort pouch from being recycled into other retort pouches or food packaging. However, the material can be recycled into an aluminized resin or up-cycled into textile materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.macopkg.com/flexible-packaging-clearing-shelves/|title=Why Flexible Packaging {{!}} Maco PKG|date=2015-06-29|newspaper=Maco PKG|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of a pouch is less than regular cans or bottles, and the energy required to produce each pouch is less than competing packaging from metals, paper, and glass.

==Reception==
In the [[consumer]] market, retort pouches have gained great popularity outside of the United States, particularly in the [[Pacific Rim]] region. However, American consumers have evidently demonstrated reluctance regarding the packaging technology, and its adoption has been slow. As a result, many retort packages sold in the United States are packaged in [[carton]]s to give them an appearance more familiar to consumers. [[Tasty Bite]] products are an example of a retort pouch product packaged in a carton. Several American food distributors have begun manufacturing foods in retort pouches without cartons, notably [[tuna]] canning companies [[Chicken of the Sea]], and [[Bumble Bee (brand)|Bumble Bee]]. In 2012, the [[Campbell Soup Company]] introduced its ''Go'' line of ready-to-eat soups in stand-up retort pouches to American consumers. The product launch came with a marketing campaign targeted toward [[Millennials]], who have shown reluctance to purchasing other Campbell Soup products in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2012/12/06/kicking-the-can-campbells-ceo-bets-on-soup-in-a-bag-for-20-somethings/ |title=Kicking The Can: Campbell's CEO Bets On Soup-In-A-Bag For 20-Somethings |publisher=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|windows with variable opacity|wearable computing|Smartglasses|the Xbox control application|Xbox SmartGlass}}'''Smart glass''' or '''switchable glass''' (also '''smart windows''' or '''switchable windows''' in those applications) is a [[glass]] or [[glazing in architecture|glazing]] whose light transmission properties are altered when voltage, light or heat is applied. Generally, the glass changes from [[Opacity (optics)|translucent]] to [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]], changing from blocking some (or all) wavelengths of light to letting light pass through.

Smart glass technologies include [[electrochromism|electrochromic]], [[photochromism|photochromic]], [[thermochromism|thermochromic]], [[#Suspended-particle devices|suspended-particle]], [[#Micro-blinds|micro-blind]] and [[#Polymer-dispersed liquid-crystal devices|polymer-dispersed liquid-crystal]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baetens|first1=R.|last2=Jelle|first2=B.P.|last3=Gustavsen|first3=A.|title=Properties, requirements and possibilities of smart windows for dynamic daylight and solar energy control in buildings: A state-of-the-art review|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|date=2010|volume=94|issue=2|pages=87–105|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2009.08.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When installed in the envelope of buildings, smart glass creates [[climate adaptive building shells]], with the ability to save costs for [[HVAC|heating, air-conditioning]] and [[lighting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=E.S.|last2=Tavil|first2=A.|title=Energy and visual comfort performance of electrochromic windows with overhangs|journal=Building and Environment|date=2007|volume=42|issue=6|pages=2439–2449|doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2006.04.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loonen|first1=R.C.G.M.|last2=Singaravel|first2=S.|last3=Trcka|first3=M|last4=Costola|first4=D|last5=Hensen|first5=J.L.M.|title=Simulation-based support for product development of innovative building envelope components|journal=Automation in Construction|date=2014|volume=45|pages=86–95|doi=10.1016/j.autcon.2014.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and avoid the cost of installing and maintaining motorized light screens or [[window blind|blind]]s or [[curtain]]s. Blackout smart glass blocks 99.4% of [[ultraviolet light]], reducing fabric fading.  For suspended particle device (SPD)-type smart glass, this is achieved in conjunction with low [[emissivity]] coatings.

Critical aspects of smart glass include material costs, installation costs, electricity costs and durability, as well as functional features such as the speed of control, possibilities for dimming, and the degree of transparency.

== Electrically switchable smart glass ==

=== Suspended-particle devices ===

In suspended-particle devices (SPDs), a thin film laminate of rod-like nano-scale particles is suspended in a liquid and placed between two pieces of glass or plastic, or attached to one layer. When no voltage is applied, the suspended particles are randomly organized, thus blocking and absorbing light. When voltage is applied, the suspended particles align and let light pass. Varying the voltage of the film varies the orientation of the suspended particles, thereby regulating the tint of the glazing and the amount of light transmitted.

SPDs can be manually or automatically "tuned" to precisely control the amount of light, glare and heat passing through, reducing the need for air conditioning during the summer months and heating during winter. Smart glass can be controlled through a variety of mediums, such as automatic photosensors and motion detectors, smartphone applications, integration with intelligent building and vehicle systems, knobs or light switches.

===Electrochromic devices===

[[Electrochromic devices]] change light transmission properties in response to voltage and thus allow control over the amount of light and heat passing through.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=Ting |last2=Walter |first2=Erich C. |last3=Agrawal |first3=Amit |last4=Bohn |first4=Christopher |last5=Velmurugan |first5=Jeyavel |last6=Zhu |first6=Wenqi |last7=Lezec |first7=J. |last8=Talin |first8=A.Alec |title=High-contrast and fast electrochromic switching enabled by plasmonics |journal=Nature Communications |date=27 January 2016 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10479 |accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In electrochromic windows, the electrochromic material changes its [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]: it changes between a [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] and a tinted state. A burst of electricity is required for changing its opacity, but once the change has been effected, no electricity is needed for maintaining the particular shade which has been reached.&lt;ref name="AmericanScientist"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mortimer |first1=Roger J. |title=Switching Colors with Electricity |url=https://www.americanscientist.org/article/switching-colors-with-electricity |accessdate=2 August 2018 |publisher=American Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

First generation electrochromic technologies tend to have a yellow cast in their clear states and blue hues in their tinted states. Darkening occurs from the edges, moving inward, and is a slow process, ranging from many seconds to several minutes (20-30 minutes) depending on window size. Newer electrochromic technologies, also known as "smart-tinting glass," tackled the drawbacks of earlier versions by eliminating the yellow cast in the clear state and tinting to more neutral shades of gray, tinting evenly rather than from the outside in, and accelerating the tinting speeds to less than three minutes, regardless of the size of the glass.  However, these newer electrochromic technologies have yet to pass ASTM-2141 for long term reliability and durability testing.  This lack of third party independent ASTM certification is one of the limiting aspects of market acceptance in comparison to first generation electrochomric technologies that have successfully passed ASTM-2141 certification.

Electrochromic glass provides visibility even in the darkened state and thus preserves visible contact with the outside environment. It has been used in small-scale applications such as rearview mirrors. Electrochromic technology also finds use in indoor applications, for example, for protection of objects under the glass of museum display cases and picture frame glass from the damaging effects of the UV and visible wavelengths of artificial light.
Electrochromic glass can be programmed to automatically tint according to the weather or the sun's position or user preferences. It can also be controlled via mobile applications and even via popular voice assistants. 

Recent advances in electrochromic materials pertaining to transition-metal hydride electrochromics have led to the development of reflective hydrides, which become reflective rather than absorbing, and thus switch states between transparent and mirror-like.

Recent advancements in modified porous nano-crystalline films have enabled the creation of electrochromic display. The single substrate display structure consists of several stacked porous layers printed on top of each other on a substrate modified with a transparent conductor (such as [[Indium tin oxide|ITO]] or [[PEDOT:PSS]]). Each printed layer has a specific set of functions. A working electrode consists of a positive porous semiconductor (say Titanium Dioxide, {{chem|TiO|2}}) with adsorbed chromogens (different chromogens for different colors). These chromogens change color by reduction or oxidation. A passivator is used as the negative of the image to improve electrical performance. The insulator layer serves the purpose of increasing the contrast ratio and separating the working electrode electrically from the counter electrode. The counter electrode provides a high capacitance to counterbalances the charge inserted/extracted on the SEG electrode (and maintain overall device charge neutrality). Carbon is an example of charge reservoir film. A conducting carbon layer is typically used as the conductive back contact for the counter electrode. In the last printing step, the porous monolith structure is overprinted with a liquid or polymer-gel electrolyte, dried, and then may be incorporated into various encapsulation or enclosures, depending on the application requirements. Displays are very thin, typically 30 micrometer, or about 1/3 of a human hair. The device can be switched on by applying an electrical potential to the transparent conducting substrate relative to the conductive carbon layer. This causes a reduction of viologen molecules (coloration) to occur inside the working electrode. By reversing the applied potential or providing a discharge path, the device bleaches. A unique feature of the electrochromic monolith is the relatively low voltage (around 1 Volt) needed to color or bleach the viologens. This can be explained by the small over- potentials needed to drive the electrochemical reduction of the surface adsorbed viologens/chromogens.

===Polymer-dispersed liquid-crystal devices===
[[File:Electrochromic glass.ogv|thumb|An example of PDLC glass as used in a hotel bathroom]]
In polymer-dispersed [[liquid crystal|liquid-crystal]] devices (PDLCs), liquid crystals are dissolved or dispersed into a liquid polymer followed by solidification or curing of the polymer. During the change of the polymer from a liquid to solid, the liquid crystals become incompatible with the solid polymer and form droplets throughout the solid polymer. The curing conditions affect the size of the droplets that in turn affect the final operating properties of the "smart window". Typically, the liquid mix of polymer and liquid crystals is placed between two layers of glass or plastic that include a thin layer of a transparent, conductive material followed by curing of the polymer, thereby forming the basic sandwich structure of the smart window. This structure is in effect a capacitor.

Electrodes from a power supply are attached to the transparent electrodes. With no applied voltage, the liquid crystals are randomly arranged in the droplets, resulting in scattering of light as it passes through the smart window assembly. This results in the translucent, "milky white" appearance. When a voltage is applied to the electrodes, the electric field formed between the two transparent electrodes on the glass causes the liquid crystals to align, allowing light to pass through the droplets with very little scattering and resulting in a transparent state. The degree of transparency can be controlled by the applied voltage. This is possible because at lower voltages, only a few of the liquid crystals align completely in the electric field, so only a small portion of the light passes through while most of the light is scattered. As the voltage is increased, fewer liquid crystals remain out of alignment, resulting in less light being scattered. It is also possible to control the amount of light and heat passing through, when tints and special inner layers are used. It is also possible to create fire-rated and anti X-Ray versions for use in special applications. Most of the devices offered today operate in on or off states only, even though the technology to provide for variable levels of transparency is easily applied. This technology has been used in interior and exterior settings for privacy control (for example conference rooms, intensive-care areas, bathroom/shower doors) and as a temporary [[projection screen]]. It is commercially available in rolls as adhesive-backed [[smart film]] that can be applied to existing windows and trimmed to size in the field.

==Related areas of technology==
The expression '''smart glass''' can be interpreted in a wider sense to include also glazings that change light transmission properties in response to an environmental signal such as light or temperature.
* Different types of glazing can show a variety of [[chromism|chromic phenomena]], that is, based on [[photochemistry|photochemical]] effects the glazing changes its light transmission properties in response to an environmental signal such as light ([[photochromism]]), temperature ([[thermochromism]]), or voltage ([[electrochromism]]).
* Liquid crystals, when they are in a [[thermotropic]] state, can change light transmission properties in response to temperature.
* Various metals have been investigated. Thin Mg-Ni films have low visible transmittance and are reflective. When they are exposed to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas or reduced by an alkaline electrolyte, they become transparent. This transition is attributed to the formation of [[magnesium nickel hydride]], Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Films were created by cosputtering from separate targets of Ni and Mg to facilitate variations in composition. Single-target d.c. magnetron sputtering could be used eventually which would be relatively simple compared to deposition of electrochromic oxides, making them more affordable. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory determined that new transition metals were cheaper and less reactive, but contained the same qualities, thus further reducing the cost.
* Tungsten-doped [[Vanadium dioxide]] VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coating reflects infrared light when the temperature rises over 29 degrees Celsius, to block out sunlight transmission through windows at high ambient temperatures.

These types of glazings cannot be controlled manually. In contrast, all electrically switched smart windows can be made to automatically adapt their light transmission properties in response to temperature or brightness by integration with a thermometer or [[photodetector|photosensor]], respectively

In the field of [[sociolinguistics]], '''social network''' describes the structure of a particular [[speech community]].  Social networks are composed of a "web of ties" ([[Lesley Milroy]]) between individuals, and the structure of a [[Social network|network]] will vary depending on the types of connections it is composed of. Social network theory (as used by sociolinguists) posits that social networks, and the interactions between members within the networks, are a driving force behind language change.

==Structure==
[[File:Social-network.png|thumb|247x247px|A very simple social network. The black lines represent connections between individuals.]]

===Participants===
The key participant in a social network is the ''anchor'', or center individual.  From this anchor, ties of varying strengths radiate outwards to other people with whom the anchor is directly linked.  These people are represented by ''points''. Participants in a network, regardless of their position, can also be referred to as ''actors ''or ''members''.

===Relationships===
There are multiple ways to describe the structure of a social network. Among them are ''density, member closeness centrality, multiplexity, ''and'' orders''. These metrics measure the different ways of connecting within of a network, and when used together they provide a complete picture of the structure of a particular network.

A social network is defined as either "loose" or "tight" depending on how connected its members are with each other, as measured by factors like density and multiplexity.&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh, Ronald (2006). ''An Introduction to Sociolinguistics''. New York: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;  This measure of tightness is essential to the study of socially motivated language change because the tightness of a social network correlates with lack of innovation in the population's speech habits. Conversely, a loose network is more likely to innovate linguistically.

====Density====
The density of a given social network is found by dividing the number of all existing links between the actors by the number of potential links within the same set of actors.&lt;ref name="Bergs 2005"&gt;Bergs, A. (2005). ''Social Networks and Historical Sociolinguistics: Studies in Morphosyntactic Variation in the Paston Letters''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter. 22-37.&lt;/ref&gt;  The higher the resulting number, the more dense a network is. Dense networks are most likely to be found in small, stable communities with few external contacts and a high degree of social cohesion.  Loose social networks, by contrast, are more liable to develop in larger, unstable communities that have many external contacts and exhibit a relative lack of social cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, Peter (2010). ''Investigations in Sociohistorical Linguistics''. Cambridge: University Press. 61-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Member closeness centrality====
Member closeness centrality is the measurement of how close an individual actor is to all the other actors in the community. An actor with high closeness centrality is a central member, and thus has frequent interaction with other members of the network. A central member of a network tends to be under pressure to maintain the norms of that network, while a peripheral member of the network (one with a low closeness centrality score) does not face such pressure.&lt;ref name="Milroy 1987"&gt;Milroy, L. (1987). ''Language and Social Networks''. New York: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, central members of a given network are typically not the first members to adopt a linguistic innovation because they are socially motivated to speak according to pre-existing norms within the network.&lt;ref name="Milroy 2002"&gt;Milroy, Lesley (2002). "Social Networks". In: ''The Handbook of Language Variation and Change''. Oxford. Blackwell. 549-572.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multiplexity====
Multiplexity is the number of separate social connections between any two actors. It has been defined as the "interaction of exchanges within and across relationships".&lt;ref name="Bliemel, McCarthy and Maine 2014"&gt;Bliemel, M.J., McCarthy, I.P., &amp; Maine, E. (2014). "An Integrated Approach to Studying Multiplexity in Entrepreneurial Networks". Entrepreneurship Research Journal, 4(4), 367-402.&lt;/ref&gt; A single tie between individuals, such as a shared workplace, is a uniplex relationship. A tie between individuals is multiplex'' ''when those individuals interact in multiple social contexts.  For instance, A is B's boss, and they have no relationship outside of work, so their relationship is uniplex. However, C is both B's coworker and neighbor, so the relationship between B and C is multiplex, since they interact with each other in a variety of social roles.&lt;ref name="Bergs 2005" /&gt;

====Orders====
Orders are a way of defining the place of a speaker within a social network. Actors are classified into three different zones
[[File:Visualization of two sampling zones of a social network, snowball sampling technique.jpg|right|thumb|
Visualization of [[snowball sampling]] technique showing two sampling zones. The first-order zone contains 7 individuals (black nodes). The second-order zone contains individuals that have direct contact to individuals in the first-order zone. The circles indicate the boundaries of the zones.
|254x254px]] depending on the strength of their connection to a certain actor.&lt;ref name="Milroy 1980"&gt;Milroy, L. (1980). Language and Social Networks. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; The closer an individual's connection to the central member is, the more powerful an individual will be within their network. Social network theories of language change look for correlation between a speaker's order and their use of prestigious or non-prestigious linguistic variants.
* '''First order zone'''
A ''first order zone'' is composed of all individuals that are directly linked to any given individual. The first order zone can also be referred to as the "interpersonal environment"&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, Peter H. 1966. "Research strategies in measuring peer group influence," Pp. 190-214 in College Peer Grotips, edited by Theodore h4. Newcomb and Everett K. Wilson. Chicago: Aldine.&lt;/ref&gt; or "neighborhood". A first order member of a network is an actor who has a large number of direct connections to the center of the network.
* '''Second order zone'''
A ''second order zone'' is a grouping of any individuals who are connected to at least one actor within the first order zone. However, actors in the second order zone are not directly connected to the central member of the network. A second order member has a loose or indirect connection to the network, and may only be connected to a certain network member.
* '''Third order zone'''
A ''third order zone'' is made up of newly observed individuals not directly connected to the first order zone.&lt;ref&gt;Milroy, Leslie and Matthew Gordon (2008). "The Concept of Social Network". "Sociolinguistics: Method and Interpretation". Oxford: John Wiley &amp; Sons. 116-133.&lt;/ref&gt; Third order members may be connected to actors in the second order zone, but not the first. They are peripheral members of the network, and are often the actors with the lowest member closeness centrality, since they may not have frequent contact with other members of the network.

===Sociolinguistic research===

====Fieldwork====
Social networks are used in sociolinguistics to explain linguistic variation in terms of community norms, rather than broad categories like gender or race.&lt;ref name="Milroy 1980" /&gt; Instead of focusing on the social characteristics of speakers, social network analysis concentrates on the relationships between speakers, then considers linguistic change in the light of those relationships. In an effort to depart from [[Variation (linguistics)|variationist sociolinguistics]],&lt;ref&gt;E.g., in the opening chapter of The Handbook of Language Variation and Change (ed. Chambers et al., Blackwell 2002), J.K. Chambers writes that "variationist sociolinguistics had its effective beginnings only in 1963, the year in which William Labov presented the first sociolinguistic research report"; the dedication page of the Handbook says that Labov's "ideas imbue every page".&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of the social network has been used to examine the links between the strength of [[Interpersonal ties|network ties]] and the use of a linguistic variant. This allows researchers to create an accurate picture of a community's language use without resorting to stereotypical classification.

The concept of social networks is applicable at both the macro and micro levels.  Social networks are at work in communities as large as nation-states or as small as an online dating service. They can also be applied to intimate social groups such as a friendship, family unit, or neighborhood. Because even the smallest of networks contains an enormous number of potential connections between actors, sociolinguists usually only study small networks so that the fieldwork is manageable. In fact, even when studying small networks, sociolinguists rely on the metrics outlined in the previous section, rather than mapping the network out, one connection at a time. One way of mapping the general structure of a network is to assign a ''strength scale'' to each speaker. For example, in Lesley Milroy's study of social networks in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the researchers measured five social variables, which together generated a strength scale for each member of the network: 
: (1) Membership of a high-density, territorially based cluster.
: (2) Having substantial ties of kinship in the neighborhood (more than one household, in addition to his own nuclear family). 
: (3) Working at the same place as at least two others from the same area. 
: (4) The same place of work as at least two others of the same sex from the area. 
: (5) Voluntary association with work mates in leisure hours.&lt;ref name="Milroy 1980" /&gt;
The allocation of a network strength score allows the network patterns of individuals to be measured and possible links with linguistic patterns to be tested.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Jonathan (2004). ''Language Change and Sociolinguistics: Rethinking Social Networks (Palgrave Studies in Language Variation)''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Computational modeling====
In recent years, [[computer simulation]] and modeling have been used to study social networks from a broader perspective.&lt;ref name="Fagyal 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bergs 2010"&gt;Bergs, A. (2006). Analyzing online communication from a social network point of view: questions, problems, perspectives. Language@Internet, 3, article 3. (urn:nbn:de:0009-7-3712)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swarup"&gt;Swarup, S., Apolloni, A. &amp; Fagyal, Z. (2011). A model of norm emergence and innovation in language change.. In L. Sonenberg, P. Stone, K. Tumer &amp; P. Yolum (eds.), AAMAS (p./pp. 693-700), : IFAAMAS. {{ISBN|978-0-9826571-5-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because previous social network studies were focused on individual connections, the size of the networks were limited so that the researcher could work personally with subjects. With the rise of advanced computer modeling techniques, sociolinguists have been able to study the linguistic behavior of large networks of individuals over long periods of time without the inconvenience of individually working with thousands of subjects.

Advances in computer simulation and modeling technology have been used to study social networks on a larger scale, both with more participants and over a greater span of time.&lt;ref name="Fagyal 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bergs 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swarup" /&gt;  Previous social network studies had to examine individual connections in great detail, and so had to limit the size of the networks involved.  Linguists working in the field were also unable to accurately pinpoint the causes of linguistic change because it tends to occur slowly over a long period of time, on a scale beyond the scope of a single research project.  With the rise of computer modeling, sociolinguists have been able to study the linguistic behavior of large networks without the huge expenditure of time required to individually work with thousands of subjects long-term. The pioneering study in this field was Fagyal et al. in 2011.&lt;ref name="Fagyal 2010" /&gt;

===Social network theory===
Because social networks investigate the forces that impact individual behavior, rather than simply attributing linguistic difference to social class, a theory of language change based on social networks is able to explain linguistic behavior more deeply than variationist sociolinguistics. The two major findings of social network theory are that dense (highly interconnected) networks are resistant to change, and that most linguistic change is initiated by weak links—people who are not centrally connected to the network in question. Though most sociolinguistics working on social networks agree on these findings, there has been extended debate about which actors in the network are the primary drivers of linguistic change. The results of this debate are two theories, the strong-tie theory, and the weak-tie theory.

====Strong tie theory====
: The strong tie theory, or agentive theory, has long been thought of in classical sociolinguistic theory as a driver of change, even prior to social network theory.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, J. C 1969. The concept and use of social networks. See Ref. 40, I-50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, D. 1972. Social Circles, Scale and Social Organization. Presented to Burg Wartenstein Symp. 25. Scale and Social Organization, Wenner-Gren Found. Anthropol. Res.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, J. A. (1969). Graph theory and social networks: A technical comment on connectedness and connectivity. Sociology 3(2):215-32&lt;/ref&gt;  In the context of [[social network theory]], agents are the people who are most connected to others in the network, and whose [[Style (sociolinguistics)|speech style]] is often imitated by people within the network. These agents also regulate language usage inside the network, and therefore ensure the dominance of their preferred variant form throughout the network, because group members are more likely to adopt high-status variants.  Strong tie networks are believed to be resistant to linguistic innovation, because prestige forms also tend to be conservative forms.&lt;ref&gt;Labov, W. 1969. 'Contraction, Deletion, and Inherent Variability of the English Copula'. Language 45: 715-762&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milroy, Lesley. 1980. Language and social networks. London; Baltimore: Basil Blackwell; University Park Press. xii, 218 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; Central agents are also able to engage in dialogues with leaders in other network. According to strong-tie theory, this is how new variants are spread. [[William Labov]]'s study of Philadelphia speech communities provides an example of the strong-tie theory.&lt;ref name="Fagyal 2010"&gt;Fagyal, Zsuzsanna; Swarup, Samarth; Escobar, Anna Maria; Gasser, Les; and Lakkaraju, Kiran (2010) "Centers, Peripheries, and Popularity: The Emergence of Norms in Simulated Networks of Linguistic Influence," University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics: Vol. 15: Iss. 2, Article 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Weak tie theory====
: Sociolinguists have recently begun to focus their studies on [[Interpersonal ties|weak links]]: individuals who are not closely tied to a group, such as people who move frequently or live in isolated areas.&lt;ref name="cite jstor|2776392"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Granovetter | first1 = M.

L., et al. (1983) Sociolinguistic variation and linguistic change in Belfast.&lt;/ref&gt;  Agents who are weakly connected are more likely to come into contact with new linguistic variants, since they spend most of their time interacting with people outside of the central network.&lt;ref&gt;Granovetter, Mark S. 1983.

Variation, convention, and social meaning. Plenary talk at the Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America, Oakland, CA. Retrieved 15 August 2008 from http://www.stanford.edu/~eckert/EckertLSA2005.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Weak-tie social network theory postulates that linguistic variables are spread by means of weak, uni-dimensional social links between non-central individuals. Therefore it is the case that language change will have the propensity to be faster in larger communities rather than in smaller communities.&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, Peter (2001). Extract from Peter Trudgill (2002). Sociolinguistic Variation and Change. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Support for this theory is found in Labov's study of "lames" in Harlem, and in [[Lesley Milroy]]'s 1987 Belfast study.&lt;ref name="Milroy 2002" /&gt;

==Linguistic studies==

===Support for the strong-tie theory===

====The jocks and burnouts study====
{{main|Jocks and Burnouts}}
This study demonstrated that actors chose to imitate other (more prestigious) actors who embodied desirable social attributes, especially "toughness" as exemplified by urban students. This imitation of desirable qualities indicates that strongly connected agents lead change by spreading norms through network members. In [[Penelope Eckert|Eckert's]] study of speech norms in Detroit high schools, she notes that suburban youth adopted the speech traits of urban youth (including a diphthongized and lowered [i]).&lt;ref name="Milroy 2002" /&gt;

====The Philadelphia study====
Labov's 1986 study of Philadelphia speech communities (a term used before "social networks" became widespread) demonstrated that the agents of linguistic change were the leaders of the speech communities. Actors with high levels of prestige in the linguistic led the use of these forms, and enforced them as norms within the community. Members of this network then used the forms normalized within the network outside of the network, and continuous usage led to wide adoption of these speech norms.&lt;ref name="Milroy 2002" /&gt;

====The Japanese school study====
Takeshi Sibata's 1960 study of elementary school children&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, J.K. (2009). Sociolinguistic Theory. Linguistic variation and its social significance (3rd Ed.). Oxford:Blackwell. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; provides strong support for the view that insiders, or leaders, in a social network facilitate language change. He interviewed several elementary school children, and taught them some invented words he created for the purpose of this study. After teaching the students these words, and telling them to teach the other students these words, he came back a week later to observe the results. A few children, those who were popular, friendly, cheerful, active in class activities, were the main people who spread those words. As the centers of their respective networks, these children functioned as strong-tie leaders of linguistic change.

===Support for the weak-tie theory===

====The Harlem study====
Labov's 1966 study of [[African American Vernacular English]] in South [[Harlem]],&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William. 1966. The Social Stratification of English in New York City. Washington D.C.: Center for Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that second-order actors in African American social networks were the initiators of linguistic change in their communities. Though these second-order actors, or "lames" were not held in high regard by the leaders of the speech network, they had connections to other networks, and were sources of new linguistic variables. This study served as the basis of the ''Weak Tie Theory'' proposed by Milroy and Milroy.
[[File:Belfast City Center.gif|thumb|right|Map of central Belfast|225x225px]]

====The Belfast studies====

=====Belfast: the original study=====
This [[Lesley Milroy|Milroy and Milroy]] study examined vernacular English as it was spoken in inner-city Belfast in the 1970s, in three working class communities in Belfast: those in the Ballymacarrett area, the Hammer area, and the Clonard area.  Milroy took part in the life of each community as an acquaintance, or 'friend of a friend', investigating the correlation between the integration of individuals in the community and the way those individuals speak.

Each individual studied was given a network strength score based on the person's knowledge of other people in the community, the workplace and at leisure activities to give a score of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest network 'strength score'. Out of the five variables, one measured density, while the other four measured multiplexity.

Each person's use of phonological variables, (ai), (a), (l), (th), (ʌ), (e), which were clearly indexical of the Belfast urban speech community, were then measured. The independent variables for this study were age, sex and location. These linguistic variables made up the dependent variable of the study, and were analyzed in relation to the network structure and background of each individual speaker. Deviation from the regional standard was determined by density and multiplicity of the social networks into which speakers are integrated.

The researchers found that a high network strength score was correlated with the use of vernacular forms, and therefore that the use of vernacular variants was strongly influenced by the level of integration into a network. The conclusion of the study was that close-knit networks are important for dialect maintenance.

=====Belfast: subsequent study=====
This 1987 study, also conducted by Milroy, examined the variable [u], and its relationship to working class identity. The researchers found that actors with the weakest tie to this community identity were most likely to use the variable [u], possibly as a way to strengthen their ties to the network.

In Ballymacarrett, one of the villages the researchers surveyed, unrounded [u] was most often used by young males and females, who had weak ties to the working class networks, but use the variables frequently to project an image of working-class toughness. These young people often interacted with members of other social networks, and thus spread the [u] realization through their own social networks, which resulted in the adoption of unrounded [u] in most of Belfast. These results provide support for the weak tie theory of language change, because it was the actors on the peripheries of social networks who were responsible for spreading linguistic change. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Diffusion curve of linguistic variants on a condensed time scale.tif|thumb|right|Diffusion curves displaying the number of agents who adopted each of the competing variants in the network over time. ]] --&gt;

===Bridging the two theories===

====The leaders and loners study====
One key study that employed computer simulations was Fagyal, Swarup, Escobar, Gasser, and Lakkarajud's work on the roles of group insiders (leaders) and outsiders (loners) in language change.&lt;ref name="Fagyal 2010" /&gt; The researchers found that both first-order and second-order network members (also known as "leaders" and "loners") were both needed in order for changes to spread predictably within the network.

In this study, the researchers simulated a social network of 900 participants, called nodes, which were connected into a network using a matrix algorithm. They then randomly assigned a linguistic variant to each node. On each cycle of the algorithm, every node interacted with another node, and the variant assigned to each node changed randomly depending on which variant the other node had. This cycle was repeated 40,000 times, and at the end of each cycle, the variant connected to each node was recorded.

The results of the Fagyal et al. study indicated that "in a large, socially heterogenous population", one linguistic variant eventually became the community norm, though other variants were not entirely eliminated. However, when the researchers manipulated the network to remove either loners or leaders, the results changed: without loners, one variant rapidly caused the loss of all other variants; and without leaders, no single variant became the norm for a majority of speakers.

These findings allowed the researchers to address the major debate in social network theory: whether it is leaders (or centers) or loners who are responsible for language change. In their findings, the presence of both leaders and loners was essential, though the two types of agents played different roles in the process of change.

Rather than introducing entirely new forms, leaders accelerate the adoption of forms that already exist within the network. Conversely, the researchers describe the loners' role this way: "when loners are a part of a population structure that allows their influence to reach centrally-connected hubs, they can have a decisive impact on the linguistic system over time."

Previously, researchers had posited that loners preserved old forms that had been neglected by the larger community. Fagyal et al. complicate this claim by suggesting that the role of loners in a network is to safeguard old features, then reintroduce them to the community.

===New work on online social networks===

====The Internet Chatrooms study====
The researchers in Berg's 2006 study of digital social networks as linguistic social networks note the value of social networks as both linguistic corpuses and linguistic networks.&lt;ref name="Bergs 2010" /&gt;

====The Facebook study====
In Carmen Perez-Sabater's 2012 study of Facebook users,&lt;ref&gt;Pérez-Sabater, Carmen (2012). "The Linguistics of Social Networking: A Study of Writing Conventions on Facebook". http://www.linguistik-online.de/56_12/perez-sabater.html&lt;/ref&gt; she discusses the use of English by native and non-native speakers on university Facebook pages. The researchers categorize these posts as a model of "[[computer-mediated communication]]", a new communication style that combines features of writing and speech. Facebook posts generally have a degree of informality, whether the users are native or nonnative English speakers, but native English speakers often have a higher degree of informality. For example, non-native speakers cited in the study use separated letter-style greetings and salutations, indicating [[linguistic insecurity]]. The conclusions of the study were that "computer-mediated communication" do not always tend toward informality, and that online social networks pattern similarly to non-virtual social networks.

The '''sociology of scientific ignorance''' ('''SSI''') is the study of [[ignorance]] in and of [[science]]. The most common way is to see ignorance as something relevant, rather than simply lack of [[knowledge]]. There are two distinct areas in which SSI is being studied: some focus on ignorance in [[scientific research]], whereas other focus on public ignorance of science. Sociology of scientific ignorance is a complementary field to the [[Sociology of scientific knowledge|sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When studying ignorance in scientific research, the common standpoint is that ignorance can be used as a tool in science. An example of this is [[blackboxing]], which is the notion that it can be beneficial to hide the internal parts of a system, and only make the input and output visible to the user.

Studies of public ignorance of science focuses on how scientific ignorance can affect society, the public view of science, and what can give rise to public ignorance of science. This area is related to [[Public awareness of science|public understanding of science]].

== Ignorance in scientific research ==
Generally, the word 'ignorance' has a negative tone to it, and for a long time scientific ignorance was viewed as a purely negative thing. Recently, however, people have started to abandon this idea, and instead try to find uses of deliberate ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This has generally been called useful ignorance. A first step in finding uses of ignorance is realizing that ignorance is inevitable. As [[Matthias Gross]] says: "new knowledge also means more ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gross also talks about the connection between ignorance and surprise. Surprise can reveal what scientists are ignorant of, which help them focus their research in order to gain knowledge. On the other hand, ignorance is what gives rise to surprise, making the two very connected.

=== Ignorance mobilization ===
In correspondence with [[knowledge mobilization]], which refers to moving available knowledge into use, a concept of 'ignorance mobilization' has been introduced. "Ignorance mobilization can be understood as the use of
ignorance towards the achievement of goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This concept also makes a distinction between two types of ignorance: ''active'' non-knowledge is ignorance that is intentionally or unintentionally taken into account within science; ''latent'' non-knowledge is ignorance that is not taken into account. The latter more resembles the old view of ignorance, as lack of knowledge. Ignorance mobilization can be said to aim to change latent non-knowledge into active non-knowledge, thereby making it useful for further research.

=== Specified ignorance ===
Specified ignorance is the notion of non-knowledge that the scientists are aware of, and must change into knowledge in order to gain knowledge of something else. "The express recognition of what is not yet known but needs to be known in order to lay the foundation for still more knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This can help scientist direct their research, in that it shows what pre-studies needs to be done, before doing the main research.

== Public ignorance of science ==
This division of SSI is generally looking at the causes of public ignorance of science, as well as the impact it can have on scientific research and society. One way of categorizing the causes of ignorance uses the following three categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* Deliberate choice, due to not being interested.
* Division of labour, meaning that it's not relevant to one's job.
* Mental constitution, that is having a non-scientific mind.
Studies have also been done that focus heavily on the [[role]] journalists - and media in general - play when it comes to public ignorance of science and common [[scientific misconceptions]]. The reason behind journalists spreading false or misleading information can be either because the journalists believe the information to be true, or because of some personal gain for the journalist. A common way to put weight to the journalists claims is to point to a [[Scientific controversy|controversy within the scientific world]], or to ignorance within scientific research. Although the latter is unavoidable, by the common view in SSI, this has made scientists more hesitant to discuss their ignorance, since this could be used by media to diminish their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Starfish Prime aurora from Honolulu 1.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The flash created by the explosion as seen through heavy cloud cover from [[Honolulu]] 1,445 km away]]

'''Starfish Prime''' was a July 9, 1962 [[high altitude nuclear explosion|high-altitude nuclear test]] conducted by the [[United States]], a joint effort of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) and the [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency#History|Defense Atomic Support Agency]]. It was launched from [[Johnston Atoll|Johnston Island]], and was  the largest nuclear test conducted in [[outer space]] and one of five conducted by the US in space.

A [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]] rocket carrying a [[W49]] [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear warhead]] (manufactured by [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]]) and a Mk. 2 [[atmospheric reentry|reentry vehicle]] was launched from [[Johnston Island]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]], about {{convert|1450|km|order=flip}} west-southwest of Hawaii. The explosion took place at an altitude of {{convert|250|mi|km}}, above a point {{convert|19|mi|km}} southwest of Johnston Island. It produced a [[Nuclear weapon yield|yield]] equivalent to 1.4 [[megatonnes]] of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. The explosion was about 10° above the horizon as seen from Hawaii, at 11 PM Hawaii time.&lt;ref name="vittitoe"/&gt;

==Operation Fishbowl==
{{Main|Operation Fishbowl}}
The Starfish test was one of five high-altitude tests grouped together as [[Operation Fishbowl]] within the larger [[Operation Dominic]], a series of tests in 1962 begun in response to the Soviet announcement on August 30, 1961 that they would end a three-year moratorium on testing.&lt;ref name="NWA.org"&gt;{{cite web|
title=Operation Dominic|
url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Dominic.html|
publisher=Nuclear Weapon Archive|
accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 the United States had completed six high-altitude nuclear tests, but the high-altitude tests of that year produced many unexpected results and raised many new questions. According to the U.S. Government Project Officer's Interim Report on the Starfish Prime project:&lt;ref&gt;Defense Atomic Support Agency. [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA955694&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf Project Officer's Interim Report: STARFISH Prime. Report ADA955694]. August 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Previous high-altitude nuclear tests: [[Operation Hardtack I|YUCCA]], [[Hardtack Teak|TEAK]], and [[Operation Hardtack I|ORANGE]], plus the three [[Operation Argus|ARGUS]] shots were poorly instrumented and hastily executed.  Despite thorough studies of the meager data, present models of these bursts are sketchy and tentative.  These models are too uncertain to permit extrapolation to other altitudes and yields with any confidence. Thus there is a strong need, not only for better instrumentation, but for further tests covering a range of altitudes and yields.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Starfish test was originally planned as the second in the Fishbowl series, but the first launch ([[Operation Fishbowl|Bluegill]]) was lost by the radar tracking equipment and had to be destroyed in flight.

The initial Starfish launch attempt on June 20 was aborted in flight due to failure of the [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]] launch vehicle. The Thor missile flew a normal trajectory for 59 seconds; then the rocket engine stopped, and the missile began to break apart. The range safety officer ordered the destruction of the missile and warhead. The missile was between 30,000 and 35,000 feet (9.1 and 10.7&amp;nbsp;km) in altitude when it was destroyed. Parts of the missile and some radioactive contamination fell upon [[Johnston Island]] and nearby Sand Island and the surrounding ocean.&lt;ref&gt;

On July 9, 1962, at 09:00:09 [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (11:00:09&amp;nbsp;p.m. on July 8, [[Honolulu]] time), the Starfish Prime test was detonated at an altitude of {{convert|400|km|order=flip}}.

The actual weapon [[Nuclear weapon yield|yield]] came very close to the design yield, which various sources have set at different values in the range of 1.4 to 1.45 [[megatons]] (6.0 PJ).  The nuclear warhead detonated 13 minutes 41 seconds after liftoff of the Thor missile from Johnston Island.&lt;ref&gt;

Starfish Prime caused an [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP), which was far larger than expected, so much larger that it drove much of the instrumentation off scale, causing great difficulty in getting accurate measurements.  The Starfish Prime electromagnetic pulse also made those effects known to the public by causing electrical damage in Hawaii, about {{convert|1445|km|order=flip}} away from the detonation point, knocking out about 300 streetlights,&lt;ref&gt;Vittitoe, Charles N., [http://www.ece.unm.edu/summa/notes/SDAN/0031.pdf "Did High-Altitude EMP Cause the Hawaiian Streetlight Incident?"] Sandia National Laboratories, June 1989, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; setting off numerous burglar alarms and damaging a telephone company [[Microwave radio relay#Microwave radio relay|microwave link]].&lt;ref name="KakuAxelrod1987"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michio Kaku|author2=Daniel Axelrod|title=To Win a Nuclear War: The Pentagon's Secret War Plans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yOP2v_vy2GIC&amp;pg=PA152|year=1987|publisher=Black Rose Books Ltd.|isbn=978-0-921689-06-5|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EMP damage to the microwave link shut down telephone calls from [[Kauai]] to the other [[Hawaiian islands]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

A total of 27 small rockets were launched from Johnston Island to obtain experimental data from the Starfish Prime detonation. In addition, a large number of rocket-borne instruments were launched from [[Barking Sands Missile Base|Barking Sands]], Kauai, in the Hawaiian Islands.&lt;ref name="quicklook"&gt;United States Department of Defense. Report ADA955411. [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA955411&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf "A Quick Look at the Technical Results of Starfish Prime"]. August 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of United States military ships and aircraft were operating in support of Starfish Prime in the Johnston Island area and across the nearby North Pacific region.

A few military ships and aircraft were also positioned in the region of the South Pacific Ocean near the [[Samoan Islands]]. This location was at the southern end of the magnetic field line of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] from the position of the nuclear detonation, an area known as the "southern conjugate region" for the test. An uninvited scientific expeditionary ship from the [[Soviet Union]] was stationed near Johnston Island for the test, and another Soviet scientific expeditionary ship was located in the southern conjugate region near the Samoan Islands.&lt;ref&gt;United States Central Intelligence Agency. National Intelligence Estimate. Number 11-2A-63. [http://www.foia.cia.gov/search.asp "The Soviet Atomic Energy Program"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501184323/http://www.foia.cia.gov/search.asp |date=May 1, 2008 }}. Page 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Starfish Prime detonation, bright auroras were observed in the detonation area, as well as in the southern conjugate region on the other side of the equator from the detonation. According to one of the first technical reports:&lt;ref name="quicklook"/&gt;
{{Quote|The visible phenomena due to the burst were widespread and quite intense; a very large area of the Pacific was illuminated by the auroral phenomena, from far south of the south magnetic conjugate area ([[Tongatapu]]) through the burst area to far north of the north conjugate area ([[French Frigate Shoals]])... At twilight after the burst, resonant scattering of light from [[lithium]] and other debris was observed at Johnston and French Frigate Shoals for many days confirming the long time presence of debris in the atmosphere. An interesting side effect was that the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] was aided in anti-submarine maneuvers by the light from the bomb.}}

These auroral effects were partially anticipated by [[Nicholas Christofilos]], a scientist who had earlier worked on the [[Operation Argus]] high-altitude nuclear shots.

According to U.S. atomic veteran Cecil R. Coale,&lt;ref&gt;Schwoch, James. [https://books.google.com/books?id=bFCbAn5j6gIC&amp;pg=PA132 ''Global TV: New Media and the Cold War, 1946-69''] (Illinois, 2009). Web. Accessed March 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; some hotels in Hawaii offered "rainbow bomb" parties on their roofs for Starfish Prime, contradicting some reports that the artificial aurora was unexpected.

Pages 19–21 of "A 'Quick Look' at the Technical Results of Starfish Prime" (August 1962) state:&lt;ref name="quicklook"/&gt;
{{Quote|At [[Kwajalein]], 1,400 [nautical] miles [2,600 km; 1,600 mi] to the west, a dense overcast extended the length of the eastern horizon to a height of 5 or 8 degrees. At 0900 GMT a brilliant white flash burned through the clouds rapidly changing to an expanding green ball of irradiance extending into the clear sky above the overcast. From its surface extruded great white fingers, resembling cirro-stratus clouds, which rose to 40 degrees above the horizon in sweeping arcs turning downward toward the poles and disappearing in seconds to be replaced by spectacular concentric cirrus like rings moving out from the blast at tremendous initial velocity, finally stopping when the outermost ring was 50 degrees overhead. They did not disappear but persisted in a state of frozen stillness. All this occurred, I would judge, within 45 seconds. As the purplish light turned to magenta and began to fade at the point of burst, a bright red glow began to develop on the horizon at a direction 50 degrees north of east and simultaneously 50 degrees south of east expanding inward and upward until the whole eastern sky was a dull burning red semicircle 100 degrees north to south and halfway to the [[zenith]] obliterating some of the lesser stars. This condition, interspersed with tremendous white rainbows, persisted no less than ninety minutes.

At zero time at Johnston, a white flash occurred, but as soon as one could remove his goggles, no intense light was present. A second after shot time a mottled red disc was observed directly overhead and covered the sky down to about 45 degrees from the zenith. Generally, the red mottled region was more intense on the eastern portions. Along the magnetic north-south line through the burst, a white-yellow streak extended and grew to the north from near zenith. The width of the white streaked region grew from a few degrees at a few seconds to about 5–10 degrees in 30 seconds. Growth of the auroral region to the north was by addition of new lines developing from west to east. The white-yellow auroral streamers receded upward from the horizon to the north and grew to the south and at about 2 minutes the white-yellow bands were still about 10 degrees wide and extended mainly from near zenith to the south. By about two minutes, the red disc region had completed disappearance in the west and was rapidly fading on the eastern portion of the overhead disc. At 400 seconds essentially all major visible phenomena had disappeared except for possibly some faint red glow along the north-south line and on the horizon to the north. No sounds were heard at Johnston Island that could be definitely attributed to the detonation.

Strong electromagnetic signals were observed from the burst, as were significant magnetic field disturbances and earth currents.}}

A 2006 report described the particle and field measurements of the Starfish diamagnetic cavity and the injected beta flux into the artificial radiation belt.&lt;ref&gt;

These measurements describe the explosion from 0.1 milliseconds to 16 minutes after the detonation.

==After effects==
While some of the energetic [[beta particle]]s followed the Earth's magnetic field and illuminated the sky, other high-energy electrons became trapped and formed [[radiation belt]]s around the Earth. There was much uncertainty and debate{{by whom|date=April 2013}} about the composition, magnitude and potential adverse effects from this trapped radiation after the detonation. The weaponeers became quite worried when three satellites{{which|date=February 2018}} in [[low Earth orbit]] were disabled. The half-life of the energetic electrons was only a few days. At the time it was not known that solar and cosmic particle fluxes varied by a factor 10, and energies could exceed 1 [[Electronvolt|MeV]]. In the months that followed these man-made radiation belts eventually caused six or more satellites to fail&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/07/09/the-50th-anniversary-of-starfish-prime-the-nuke-that-shook-the-world/#.WvrLEnUvw3w|title=The 50th anniversary of Starfish Prime: the nuke that shook the world - Bad Astronomy|date=July 9, 2012|work=Bad Astronomy|access-date=May 15, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as radiation [[radiation hardening|damaged]] their [[Photovoltaic module|solar arrays]] or electronics, including the first commercial relay [[communication satellite]], [[Telstar]], as well as the United Kingdom's first satellite, [[Ariel 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2909">The '''triad of violence''' is a [[sociological theory]] that originates from [[political scientist]] Michael Kaufman and elaborated on by [[sociologist]] [[Michael Messner]].&lt;ref&gt;Taking the Field: Women, Men, and Sports, University of Minnesota Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-8166-3449-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The triad of violence consists of violence against women, violence against other men, and violence against themselves.

==Violence Against Women==

This refers to instances of rape conducted by male athletes. Messner emphasizes that the '''majority''' of male athletes do not participate in violence against women. An example of this would be the [[2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/US/LegalCenter/story?id=1882072&amp;page=1 ABC News: Duke Lacrosse Scandal Sheds New Light on the Stripper Industry: A Campus Trend?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Messner argues that situations like this are an expression of masculinity through sexual aggression. However, all allegations have been dropped on the athletes.

==Violence Against Other Men==

This refers to the idea that sports encourages athletes to be act rough against opponents.  Rituals such as hazing are also example of such violence against other men. These rituals focus on suppressing empathy as a form of masculinity.

==Violence Against Themselves==

This refers to the idea of athletes being tough and being able to play through pain.  Corporations such as Nike perpetuate this notion that the body is a machine. This is best exemplified by instances where athletes injure themselves but still continue playing despite severe injuries. The high injury rate of athletes are both indicators of male athletes violence against themselves and other men.

==Michael Kaufman==

Michael Kaufman originally came up with the phrase ''Triad of Violence''. He further breaks down the analysis of men's violence in sports as the 6 P's.

'''These are'''

''patriarchal power'': which states that violence has been related with male power. Violence then becomes about maintaining power

''sense of privilege'': is the feeling that one is entitled to commit violence.

''paradox of men's power'': is that violence has become a source of power and a source of fear for men.

''psychic armor'': which argues that violence is men's way of achieving emotional distance.

''psychic pressure cooker'': masculinity has been directly tied to bottling up of emotions. Only anger has been considered a ''valid'' male emotion

''past experience'': the past experiences of men affect their attitudes towards violence.  i.e. growing up in a violent household will teach a young boy that violence is an accepted part of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europrofem.org/contri/2_04_en/en-viol/45en_vio.htm 45env - The six P's of men's violence: M.Kaufmann WRC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mīrzā Muhammad Tāraghay bin Shāhrukh''' ({{lang-chg|میرزا محمد طارق بن شاہ رخ}}, {{lang-fa|میرزا محمد تراغای بن شاہ رخ}}), better known as '''Ulugh Beg''' ({{Nastaliq|الغ‌ بیگ}}) (March 22, 1394 in [[Sultaniyeh]], [[Persia]] –  October 27, 1449, [[Samarkand]])[[Uzbekistan]]), was a [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]] ruler as well as an [[Islamic astronomy|astronomer]], [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]] and [[sultan]]. His commonly known name is not truly a personal name, but rather a [[moniker]], which can be loosely translated as "Great Ruler" (compare modern Turkish ''[[wikt:ulu|ulu]]'', "great", and ''[[wikt:bey|bey]]'', "chief") and is the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] equivalent of [[Timur]]'s Perso-Arabic title ''Amīr-e Kabīr''.&lt;ref name="EI"&gt;B.F. Manz, ''"Tīmūr Lang"'', in [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]], Online Edition, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; His real name was ''[[Mirza|Mīrzā]] Mohammad Tāraghay bin Shāhrukh''. Ulugh Beg was also notable for his work in astronomy-related mathematics, such as [[trigonometry]] and [[spherical geometry]]. He built the great [[Ulugh Beg Observatory]] in Samarkand between 1424 and 1429. It was considered by scholars to have been one of the finest observatories in the Islamic world at the time and the largest in Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Science in Islamic civilisation: proceedings of the international symposia: "Science institutions in Islamic civilisation", &amp; "Science and technology in the Turkish and Islamic world"[https://books.google.com/books?id=ki3YAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ulugh+beg+cultural+centre+observatory&amp;dq=ulugh+beg+cultural+centre+observatory&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ntlYT9-_JsfO8QOig-jsDg&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCDgK]&lt;/ref&gt; He built the [[Ulugh Beg Madrasa, Samarkand|Ulugh Beg Madrasah]] (1417–1420) in Samarkand and [[Bukhara]], transforming the cities into cultural centers of learning in Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;The global built environment as a representation of realities: By author:A.J.J.

== Early life ==
[[File:Jade dragon cup.jpg|thumb|[[Jade]] dragon cup that once belonged to Ulugh Beg, 1420-1449 AD, [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=255413&amp;partId=1&amp;people=15382&amp;peoA=15382-1-1&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
He was a grandson of the great conqueror, [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) (1336–1405), and the oldest son of [[Shah Rukh (Timurid dynasty)|Shah Rukh]], both of whom came from the Turkicized&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], "[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-7271 Timur]", Online Academic Edition, 2007. Quotation: "''Timur was a member of the Turkicized Barlas tribe, a Mongol subgroup that had settled in Transoxania...&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barlas]] tribe of [[Transoxiana]] (now [[Uzbekistan]]). His mother was a noblewoman named [[Goharshad]], daughter of the representative Turkic&lt;ref&gt;В.В. Бартольд. Улугбек и его время. – [[Petrograd]], 1918 - p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opklare.ru/m/ulugbek_-_biografiya&lt;/ref&gt; of tribal aristocracy Giyasitdin Tarhan. Ulugh Beg was born in [[Sultaniyeh]] in [[Persia]] during Timur's invasion. As a child he wandered through a substantial part of the Middle East and [[India]] as his grandfather expanded his conquests in those areas. After Timur's death, however, and the accession of Ulugh Beg's father to much of the [[Timurid Empire]], he settled in Samarkand, which had been Timur's capital. After Shāhrukh moved the capital to [[Herat, Afghanistan|Herat]] (in modern [[Afghanistan]]), sixteen-year-old Ulugh Beg became his governor in Samarkand in 1409. In 1411, he became the sovereign ruler of the whole [[Transoxiana|Mavarannahr]] [[khanate]].

From an early age, astronomy piqued his interest after he paid a visit to what was still present of the [[Maragheh observatory|Maragheh Observatory]] located in [[Maragheh]], which is located in East Azerbaijan Province, Iran. This is the observatory where the well-known astronomer [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] practiced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/paksoy-2/cam6.html|title=The Legacy of Ulugh Beg {{!}} Central Asian Monuments {{!}} Edited by H.

== Science ==
The teenaged ruler set out to turn the city into an intellectual center for the empire. Between 1417 and 1420, he built a ''[[Madrasah|madrasa]]'' ("university" or "institute") on [[Registan|Registan Square]] in Samarkand (currently in [[Uzbekistan]]), and he invited numerous [[Islamic astronomy|Islamic astronomers]] and [[Islamic mathematics|mathematicians]] to study there. The ''madrasa'' building still survives. Ulugh Beg's most famous pupil in [[astronomy]] was [[Ali Qushji|Ali Qushchi]] (died in 1474).
He was also famous in the fields of medicine and poetry. He used to debate with other poets about contemporary social issues. He liked to debate in a poetic style, called "Bahribayt" among local poets. According to the medical book "Mashkovskiy" which is in the Russian language, Ulugh Beg discovered a mixture of alcohol with garlic, apparently preserving it to help treat conditions like diarrhea, headache, stomach ache and intestine illnesses. He also offered advice for newly married couples, which indicate recipes containing nuts, dried apricot, dried grape etc. He claimed these to be useful to increase men's virility. This recipe has been given in Ibn Sina's books also.

=== Astronomy ===
His own particular interests concentrated on [[astronomy]], and, in 1428, he built an enormous [[observatory]], called the ''Gurkhani Zij'',{{citation needed|reason=Term zij refers to a book of astronomical tables|date=August 2016}} similar to [[Tycho Brahe]]'s later [[Uraniborg]] as well as [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]]'s [[Constantinople Observatory of Taqi ad-Din|observatory in Constantinople]]. Lacking [[telescope]]s to work with, he increased his accuracy by increasing the length of his [[sextant (astronomical)|sextant]]; the so-called [[Sextant (astronomical)|''Fakhri'' sextant]] had a radius of about {{convert|36|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and the [[Angular resolution|optical separability]] of 180" (seconds of arc).

Using it, he compiled the 1437 ''[[Zij-i-Sultani]]'' of 994 [[star]]s, generally considered{{Who|date=November 2009}} the greatest [[star catalogue]] between those of [[Ptolemy]] and Brahe, a work that stands alongside [[Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi]]'s ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]''. The serious errors which he found in previous Arabian star catalogues (many of which had simply updated Ptolemy's work, adding the effect of [[precession of the equinoxes|precession]] to the longitudes) induced him to redetermine the positions of 992 fixed stars, to which he added 27 stars from [[Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi]]'s catalogue ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]'' from the year 964, which were too far south for observation from Samarkand. This catalogue, one of the most original of the Middle Ages, was first edited by [[Thomas Hyde]] at Oxford in 1665 under the title ''Tabulae longitudinis et latitudinis stellarum fixarum ex observatione Ulugbeighi'' and reprinted in 1767 by G. Sharpe. More recent editions are those by [[Francis Baily]] in 1843 in ''vol. xiii'' of the ''Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society'' and by [[Edward Ball Knobel]] in ''Ulugh Beg's Catalogue of Stars, Revised from all Persian Manuscripts Existing in Great Britain, with a Vocabulary of Persian and Arabic Words'' (1917).

In 1437, Ulugh Beg determined the length of the [[sidereal year]] as 365.2570370...&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; = 365&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; 6&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; 8&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; (an error of +58&amp;nbsp;seconds). In his measurements over the course of many years he used a 50&amp;nbsp;m high [[gnomon]]. This value was improved by 28&amp;nbsp;seconds in 1525 by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], who appealed to the estimation of [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] (826–901), which had an error of +2&amp;nbsp;seconds. However, Ulugh Beg later measured another more precise value of [[tropical year]] as 365&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; 49&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; 15&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;, which has an error of +25&amp;nbsp;seconds, making it more accurate than Copernicus's estimate which had an error of +30&amp;nbsp;seconds. Ulugh Beg also determined the Earth's [[axial tilt]] as 23°30'17" in the [[sexagesimal]] system of degrees, minutes and seconds of arc, which in decimal notation converts to 23.5047 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;L.P.E.A. Sédillot, ''Prolégomènes des tables astronomiques d'OlougBeg: Traduction et commentaire'' (Paris: Firmin Didot Frères, 1853), pp.&amp;nbsp;[https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_z-glhcBS2I8C#page/n129/mode/1up 87] &amp; [https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_z-glhcBS2I8C#page/n295/mode/1up 253].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
In [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], Ulugh Beg wrote accurate [[Trigonometry|trigonometric]] tables of [[Trigonometric function|sine]] and [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] values correct to at least eight decimal places.

== Death ==
Ulugh Beg's scientific expertise was not matched by his skills in governance. When he heard of the death of his father [[Shahrukh Mirza]], Ulugh Beg went to [[Balkh]], where he heard that his nephew [[Ala-ud-Daulah Mirza bin Baysonqor]], son of Ulugh Beg's brother [[Baysonqor]], had claimed the emirship of the [[Timurid Empire]] in [[Herat]]. Consequently, Ulugh Beg marched against Ala-ud-Daulah and met him in battle at [[Bala Murghab|Murghab]]. Having won this battle, Ulugh Beg advanced toward Herat and massacred its people in 1448, but Ala-ud-Daulah's brother [[Mirza Abul-Qasim Babur bin Baysonqor]] came to his aid, defeating Ulugh Beg. Ulugh Beg retreated to Balkh, where he found that its governor, his oldest son [[Abdal-Latif Mirza]], had rebelled against him. Another civil war ensued. Within two years, he was beheaded by the order of his own eldest son while on his way to [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, John. ''The history of Persia. Containing, the lives and memorable actions of its kings from the first erecting of that monarchy to this time; an exact Description of all its Dominions; a curious Account of India, China, Tartary, Kermon, Arabia, Nixabur, and the Islands of Ceylon and Timor; as also of all Cities occasionally mention'd, as Schiras, Samarkand, Bokara, &amp;c.

==Marriages==
Ulugh Beg had thirteen wives:
* Aka Begi Begum, daughter of Muhammad Sultan Mirza bin Jahangir Mirza and Khan Sultan Khanika, mother of Habiba Sultan known as Khanzada Begum and another Khanzada Begum;
* Sultan Badi al-mulk Begum, daughter of [[Khalil Sultan]] bin [[Miran Shah]] and Shad Malik Agha;

==Legacy==
* The crater, [[Ulugh Beigh (crater)|Ulugh Beigh]], on the [[Moon]], was named after him by the German astronomer [[Johann Heinrich von Mädler]] on his 1830 map of the Moon.
* [[2439 Ulugbek]], a [[Asteroid belt|main-belt]] [[asteroid]] which was discovered on 21 August 1977 by [[N. Chernykh]] at [[Nauchnyj]], was named after him.

==Exhumation==

Soviet anthropologist [[Mikhail Mikhaylovich Gerasimov|Mikhail M. Gerasimov]] reconstructed the face of Ulugh Beg.
