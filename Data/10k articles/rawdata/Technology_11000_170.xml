An '''alternative fuel vehicle''' is a vehicle that runs on a fuel other than traditional [[petroleum fuel]]s ([[petrol]] or [[Diesel fuel]]); and also refers to any technology of powering an engine that does not involve solely [[petroleum]] (e.g. [[electric car]], [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s, solar powered).  Because of a combination of factors, such as environmental concerns, high oil prices and the potential for [[peak oil]], development of cleaner alternative fuels and advanced power systems for vehicles has become a high priority for many governments and vehicle manufacturers around the world.

[[Hybrid electric vehicle]]s such as the [[Toyota Prius]] are not actually alternative fuel vehicles, but through advanced technologies in the electric battery and motor/generator, they make a more efficient use of petroleum fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/revealed-how-the-hybrid-car-works.html |title=Revealed - how the hybrid car "works" &amp;#124; Claverton Group |publisher=Claverton-energy.com |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research and development efforts in alternative forms of power focus on developing [[battery electric vehicle|all-electric]] and [[fuel cell vehicle]]s, and even the stored energy of compressed air.

An environmental analysis extends beyond just the operating efficiency and emissions. A [[life-cycle assessment]] of a vehicle involves production and post-use considerations. A [[cradle-to-cradle design]] is more important than a focus on a single factor such as the type of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

{{Main|Compressed-air engine|Compressed-air vehicle|Compressed-air car}}
The air engine is an emission-free piston engine that uses compressed air as a source of energy.  The first compressed air car was invented by a French engineer named [[Guy Nègre]]. The expansion of compressed air may be used to drive the pistons in a modified piston engine.  Efficiency of operation is gained through the use of environmental heat at normal temperature to warm the otherwise cold expanded air from the storage tank. This non-adiabatic expansion has the potential to greatly increase the efficiency of the machine.  The only exhaust is cold air (−15&amp;nbsp;°C), which could also be used to air condition the car.  The source for air is a pressurized carbon-fiber tank. Air is delivered to the engine via a rather conventional injection system. Unique crank design within the engine increases the time during which the air charge is warmed from ambient sources and a two-stage process allows improved heat transfer rates.

=== Battery-electric ===

[[File:EV1 (6).jpg|thumb|[[General Motors EV1]] [[electric car]].]]

[[Battery electric vehicle]]s (BEVs), also known as all-electric vehicles (AEVs), are electric vehicles whose main energy storage is in the chemical energy of batteries. BEVs are the most common form of what is defined by the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB) as [[zero emission vehicle]] (ZEV) because they produce no tailpipe emissions at the point of operation. The electrical energy carried on board a BEV to power the motors is obtained from a variety of battery chemistries arranged into battery packs. For additional range genset trailers or pusher trailers are sometimes used, forming a type of hybrid vehicle. Batteries used in electric vehicles include "flooded" lead-acid, absorbed glass mat, NiCd, nickel metal hydride, Li-ion, Li-poly and zinc-air batteries.

Attempts at building viable, modern [[battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered electric vehicles began in the 1950s with the introduction of the first modern ([[transistor]] controlled) electric car – the [[Henney Kilowatt]], even though the concept was out in the market since 1890. Despite the poor sales of the early battery-powered vehicles, development of various battery-powered vehicles continued through the mid-1990s, with such models as the [[General Motors EV1]] and the [[Toyota RAV4 EV]].

[[File:2017 Nissan LEAF (ZE0 MY17) hatchback (2018-11-02) 01.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Nissan Leaf]] is the world's top selling highway-capable all-electric car in history. The Leaf achieved the milestone of 250,000 units sold globally in December 2016.&lt;ref name=LeafBest250K/&gt;]]

Battery powered cars had primarily used [[lead-acid batteries]] and [[Nickel metal hydride|NiMH batteries]]. Lead-acid batteries' recharge capacity is considerably reduced if they're discharged beyond 75% on a regular basis, making them a less-than-ideal solution. NiMH batteries are a better choice{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}, but are considerably more expensive than lead-acid.

A solar car is an electric vehicle powered by solar energy obtained from solar panels on the car. Solar panels cannot currently be used to directly supply a car with a suitable amount of power at this time, but they can be used to extend the range of electric vehicles. They are raced in competitions such as the World Solar Challenge and the North American Solar Challenge. These events are often sponsored by Government agencies such as the United States Department of Energy keen to promote the development of [[alternative energy]] technology such as solar cells and electric vehicles. Such challenges are often entered by universities to develop their students engineering and technological skills as well as motor vehicle manufacturers such as GM and Honda.
[[Image:Trev solar car.png|thumb|left|200px| Trev's battery lasts over 250,000 kilometres.]]

The [[North American Solar Challenge]] is a solar car race across North America. Originally called Sunrayce, organized and sponsored by General Motors in 1990, it was renamed American Solar Challenge in 2001, sponsored by the United States Department of Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  Teams from universities in the United States and Canada compete in a long distance test of endurance as well as efficiency, driving thousands of miles on regular highways.

[[Nuna]] is the name of a series of manned solar powered vehicles that won the World solar challenge in Australia three times in a row, in 2001 (Nuna 1 or just Nuna), 2003 (Nuna 2) and 2005 (Nuna 3). The Nunas are built by students of the Delft University of Technology.

The [[World solar challenge]] is a solar powered car race over {{convert|3021|km|mi}} through central Australia from Darwin to Adelaide. The race attracts teams from around the world, most of which are fielded by universities or corporations although some are fielded by high schools.

Trev (two-seater [[renewable energy]] vehicle) was designed by the staff and students at the University of South Australia. Trev was first displayed at the 2005 World Solar Challenge as the concept of a low-mass, efficient commuter car. With 3 wheels and a mass of about 300&amp;nbsp;kg, the prototype car had maximum speed of 120&amp;nbsp;km/h and acceleration of 0–100&amp;nbsp;km/h in about 10 seconds. The running cost of Trev is projected to be less than 1/10 of the running cost of a small petrol car.

===Ammonia fuelled vehicles===

[[File:AmmoniacalGasEngineStreetcarARWaud.jpeg|thumb|Ammoniacal Gas Engine [[Streetcars in New Orleans|Streetcar in New Orleans]] drawn by [[Alfred Waud]] in 1871.]]
[[File:x-15.jpg|thumb|The [[X-15]] aircraft used ammonia as one component [[fuel]] of its [[rocket]] engine ]]
[[Ammonia production|Ammonia]] is produced by combining gaseous hydrogen with nitrogen from the air. Large-scale ammonia production uses natural gas for the source of hydrogen. Ammonia was used during World War II to power buses in Belgium, and in engine and solar energy applications prior to 1900. Liquid ammonia also fuelled the [[Reaction Motors XLR99]] rocket engine, that powered the [[X-15]] hypersonic research aircraft. Although not as powerful as other fuels, it left no soot in the reusable rocket engine and its density approximately matches the density of the oxidizer, liquid oxygen, which simplified the aircraft's design.

[[Ammonia]] has been proposed as a practical alternative to [[fossil fuel]] for [[internal combustion engines]].&lt;ref name=c1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.energy.iastate.edu/Renewable/ammonia/ammonia/2007/Olson2_NH3.pdf |title=Ammonia as a Transportation Fuel IV |date=15–16 October 2007 |publisher=Norm Olson – Iowa Energy Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207092554/http://www.energy.iastate.edu/Renewable/ammonia/ammonia/2007/Olson2_NH3.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The calorific value of ammonia is 22.5 MJ/kg (9690 [[BTU]]/lb), which is about half that of diesel. In a normal engine, in which the water vapour is not condensed, the calorific value of ammonia will be about 21% less than this figure. It can be used in existing engines with only minor modifications to [[carburettor]]s/[[injector]]s.

If produced from coal, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be readily sequestered&lt;ref name=c1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.energy.iastate.edu/Renewable/ammonia/ammonia/ammoniaMtg07.htm |title=Iowa Energy Center, Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency; Research, Education and Demonstration – Related Renewable Energy – Ammonia 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318214445/http://www.energy.iastate.edu/Renewable/ammonia/ammonia/ammoniaMtg07.htm |archivedate=2012-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the combustion products are nitrogen and water).

Ammonia engines or ammonia motors, using ammonia as a [[working fluid]], have been proposed and occasionally used.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/POWER/ammonia/ammonia.htm
  |title=Ammonia Motors |date=1 October 2007 
  |accessdate=28 November 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is similar to that used in a [[fireless locomotive]], but with ammonia as the working fluid, instead of steam or compressed air. Ammonia engines were used experimentally in the 19th century by [[Goldsworthy Gurney]] in the UK and in [[streetcars in New Orleans]]. In 1981 a Canadian company converted a 1981 Chevrolet Impala to operate using ammonia as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0hBAz6MxC4 |title=YouTube – Ammonia Powered Car}}CBC National News Nov. 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gregvezina.ca |title=Watch 'Ammonia Fuel'|accessdate=7 July 2009|publisher=Greg Vezina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia and GreenNH3 is being used with success by developers in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nh3fuel.com |title=Watch 'Hydrofuel Inc. Update' and 'Hydrofuel NH3 Car Featured on HardDrive' |publisher=Hydrofuel Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; since it can run in spark ignited or diesel engines with minor modifications, also the only green fuel to power jet engines, and despite its toxicity is reckoned to be no more dangerous than petrol or LPG.&lt;ref name="claverton-energy.com"&gt;{{cite web|author =Green NH3 |url=http://www.GreenNH3.com |title=Greennh3.com |publisher=Greennh3.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101028193537/http://www.greennh3.com/| archivedate= 28 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be made from renewable electricity, and having half the density of petrol or diesel can be readily carried in sufficient quantities in vehicles. On complete combustion it has no emissions other than nitrogen and water vapour. The combustion chemical formula is 4 NH3 + 3 O2 → 2 N2 + 6 H2O, 75% water is the result.

The use of alcohol as a fuel for [[internal combustion engine]]s, either alone or in combination with other fuels, lapsed until the [[1973 oil crisis|oil price shocks]] of the 1970s. Furthermore, additional attention was gained because of its possible environmental and long-term economical advantages over fossil fuel.

Both [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] and [[methanol fuel|methanol]] have been used as an automotive fuel.&lt;ref name="Methanolstory" /&gt;  While both can be obtained from petroleum or natural gas, ethanol has attracted more attention because it is considered a [[renewable resource]], easily obtained from sugar or [[starch]] in crops and other agricultural produce such as [[grain]], [[sugarcane]], sugar beets or even [[lactose]]. Since ethanol occurs in nature whenever yeast happens to find a sugar solution such as overripe fruit, most organisms have evolved some tolerance to [[ethanol]], whereas [[methanol]] is toxic. Other experiments involve [[butanol fuel|butanol]], which can also be produced by fermentation of plants. Support for ethanol comes from the fact that it is a biomass fuel, which addresses [[climate change]] and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, though these benefits are now highly debated,&lt;ref name="SusEthanol" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxfam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org/files/bp114-inconvenient-truth-biofuels-0806.pdf |format=PDF |title=Another Inconvenient Truth |publisher=[[Oxfam]] |date=2008-06-28 |accessdate=2008-08-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819214631/http://www.oxfam.org/files/bp114-inconvenient-truth-biofuels-0806.pdf |archivedate=19 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }} Oxfam Briefing Paper 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Science08"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1151861|title=Use of U.S. Croplands for Biofuels Increases Greenhouse Gases Through Emissions from Land-Use Change|author =Timothy Searchinger|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=319 |issue=5867 |pages=1238–1240|date=2008-02-29| doi=10.1126/science.1151861|accessdate=2008-05-09|pmid=18258860| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080512045010/http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1151861| archivedate= 12 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|display-authors=etal}} Originally published online in Science Express on 7 February 2008.

Most modern cars are designed to run on gasoline are capable of running with a blend from 10% up to 15% ethanol mixed into gasoline ([[E15 fuel|E10-E15]]). With a small amount of redesign, gasoline-powered vehicles can run on ethanol concentrations as high as 85% ([[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E85|E85]]), the maximum set in the United States and Europe due to cold weather during the winter,&lt;ref name="E70green"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/02/27/when-is-e85-not-85-percent-ethanol-when-its-e70-with-an-e85-st/ | title= When is E85 not 85 percent ethanol?

For this reason, for pure or high ethanol blends to be attractive for users, its price must be lower than gasoline to offset the lower fuel economy. As a [[rule of thumb]], Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the local media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the results and seasonal harvests of sugar cane and by region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opiniaoweb.com/portal/alcool-ou-gasolina-saiba-qual-escolher-quando-for-abastecer/ |title=Álcool ou Gasolina?

Reacting to the high price of oil and its growing dependence on imports, in 1975 [[Brazil]] launched the [[Neat ethanol vehicle|Pro-alcool program]], a huge government-subsidized effort to manufacture ethanol fuel (from its sugar cane crop) and ethanol-powered automobiles.  These ethanol-only vehicles were very popular in the 1980s, but became economically impractical when oil prices fell – and sugar prices rose – late in that decade.  In May 2003 [[Volkswagen]] built for the first time a commercial ethanol [[flexible-fuel vehicle|flexible fuel car]], the [[Volkswagen Gol|Gol]] 1.6 Total Flex. These vehicles were a commercial success and by early 2009 other nine Brazilian manufacturers are producing flexible fuel vehicles: [[Chevrolet]], [[Fiat]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Peugeot]], [[Renault]], [[Honda]], [[Mitsubishi]], [[Toyota]], [[Citroën]], and [[Nissan]].&lt;ref name=ANFAVEA2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carmagazine.uol.com.br/materia/?id=0976085925 |title=Livina, primeiro carro flex da Nissan chega com preços entre R$ 46.690 e R$ 56.690 |publisher=Car Magazine Online |language=Portuguese |date=2009-03-18 |accessdate=2009-03-26 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of the flex technology was so rapid, that flexible fuel cars reached 87.6% of new car sales in July 2008.&lt;ref name="July2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hojenoticias.com.br/negocios/vendas-de-veiculos-flex-no-brasil-sobem-311-em-julho-ant-2008/ |title=Vendas de veículos flex no Brasil sobem 31,1% em julho 2008 |author=Reuters |date=2008-08-06 |publisher=Hoje Notícias |accessdate=2008-08-13 |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201083159/http://www.hojenoticias.com.br/negocios/vendas-de-veiculos-flex-no-brasil-sobem-311-em-julho-ant-2008/ |archivedate=2009-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2008, the fleet of "flex" automobiles and light commercial vehicles had reached 6 million new vehicles sold,&lt;ref name="Folha Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/dinheiro/ult91u428265.shtml|title=Veículos flex somam 6 milhões e alcançam 23% da frota |date=2008-08-04|publisher=Folha Online|accessdate=2008-08-12|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing almost 19% of all registered light vehicles.&lt;ref name="DENATRAN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.cidades.gov.br/renaest/detalheNoticia.do?noticia.codigo=120|publisher=Departamento Nacional de Trânsito|language=Portuguese|title=DENATRAN Frota por tipo/UF 2008 (file 2008-03)|accessdate=2008-05-03}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} As of March 31, 2008, DENATRAN reports a total fleet of 50 million, including motorcycles, trucks and special equipment, and 32 million automobiles and light commercial vehicles.&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid success of "flex" vehicles, as they are popularly known, was made possible by the existence of 33,000 filling stations with at least one ethanol pump available by 2006, a heritage of the ''Pro-alcool'' program.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/pubs/Brazil_SR_e3.pdf |title=Brazil Institute Special Report: The Global Dynamics of Biofuels |author=Daniel Budny and Paulo Sotero, editor |publisher=Brazil Institute of the Woodrow Wilson Center |date=April 2007 |accessdate=2008-05-03 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528051442/http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/pubs/Brazil_SR_e3.pdf |archivedate=28 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Apollo"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Inslee, Jay |author2=Bracken Hendricks | title = Apollo's Fire | year = 2007 | pages=153–155, 160–161 | publisher = Island Press, Washington, D.C. | isbn = 978-1-59726-175-3}} ''See Chapter 6.

In the United States, initial support to develop alternative fuels by the government was also a response to the [[1973 oil crisis]], and later on, as a goal to improve air quality. Also, liquid fuels were preferred over gaseous fuels not only because they have a better volumetric energy density but also because they were the most compatible fuels with existing distribution systems and engines, thus avoiding a big departure from the existing technologies and taking advantage of the vehicle and the refueling infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Methanolstory" /&gt; California led the search of sustainable alternatives with interest in [[Methanol fuel|methanol]].&lt;ref name="Methanolstory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.methanol.org/pdfFrame.cfm?pdf=MethanolStoryRobertaNichols.pdf |author=Roberta J Nichols |title=The Methanol Story: A Sustainable Fuel for the Future |publisher=Methanol Institute |year=2003 |accessdate=2008-08-30 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211163641/http://www.methanol.org/pdfFrame.cfm?pdf=MethanolStoryRobertaNichols.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main benefit of Diesel combustion engines is that they have a 44% fuel burn efficiency; compared with just 25–30% in the best gasoline engines.&lt;ref&gt;[[Engine efficiency]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition diesel fuel has slightly higher [[Energy Density]] by volume than gasoline. This makes Diesel engines capable of achieving much better fuel economy than gasoline vehicles.

[[Biodiesel]] (Fatty acid methyl ester), is commercially available in most oilseed-producing states in the United States. As of 2005, it is somewhat more expensive than fossil diesel, though it is still commonly produced in relatively small quantities (in comparison to petroleum products and ethanol). Many farmers who raise oilseeds use a biodiesel blend in tractors and equipment as a matter of policy, to foster production of biodiesel and raise public awareness. It is sometimes easier to find biodiesel in rural areas than in cities. Biodiesel has lower [[Energy Density]] than fossil diesel fuel, so biodiesel vehicles are not quite able to keep up with the fuel economy of a fossil fuelled diesel vehicle, if the diesel injection system is not reset for the new fuel. If the injection timing is changed to take account of the higher Cetane value of biodiesel, the difference in economy is negligible. Because biodiesel contains more oxygen than diesel or [[vegetable oil fuel]], it produces the lowest emissions from diesel engines, and is lower in most emissions than gasoline engines. Biodiesel has a higher lubricity than mineral diesel and is an additive in European pump diesel for lubricity and emissions reduction.

Some [[Diesel fuel|Diesel]]-powered cars can run with minor modifications on 100% pure [[vegetable oil]]s. Vegetable oils tend to thicken (or solidify if it is waste cooking oil), in cold weather conditions so vehicle modifications (a two tank system with diesel start/stop tank), are essential in order to heat the fuel prior to use under most circumstances.  Heating to the temperature of engine coolant reduces fuel viscosity, to the range cited by injection system manufacturers, for systems prior to 'common rail' or 'unit injection ( VW PD)' systems. Waste vegetable oil, especially if it has been used for a long time, may become hydrogenated and have increased acidity. This can cause the thickening of fuel, gumming in the engine and acid damage of the fuel system. Biodiesel does not have this problem, because it is chemically processed to be PH neutral and lower viscosity. Modern low emission diesels (most often Euro -3 and -4 compliant), typical of the current production in the European industry, would require extensive modification of injector system, pumps and seals etc. due to the higher operating pressures, that are designed thinner (heated) mineral diesel than ever before, for atomisation, if they were to use pure vegetable oil as fuel. Vegetable oil fuel is not suitable for these vehicles as they are currently produced. This reduces the market as increasing numbers of new vehicles are not able to use it. However, the German Elsbett company has successfully produced single tank vegetable oil fuel systems for several decades, and has worked with Volkswagen on their TDI engines. This shows that it is technologically possible to use vegetable oil as a fuel in high efficiency / low emission diesel engines.

Compressed Biogas may be used for Internal Combustion Engines after purification of the raw gas. The removal of H2O, H2S and particles can be seen as standard producing a gas which has the same quality as Compressed Natural Gas.

High-pressure [[compressed natural gas]], mainly composed of methane, that is used to fuel normal combustion engines instead of gasoline. Combustion of methane produces the least amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of all fossil fuels. Gasoline cars can be retrofitted to CNG and become bifuel [[Natural gas vehicle]]s (NGVs) as the gasoline tank is kept. The driver can switch between CNG and gasoline during operation. [[Natural gas vehicle]]s (NGVs) are popular in regions or countries where natural gas is abundant.

A [[hydrogen]] car is an automobile which uses hydrogen as its primary source of power for locomotion. These cars generally use the hydrogen in one of two methods: combustion or [[fuel-cell]] conversion. In combustion, the hydrogen is "burned" in engines in fundamentally the same method as traditional gasoline cars. In fuel-cell conversion, the hydrogen is turned into electricity through fuel cells which then powers electric motors. With either method, the only byproduct from the spent hydrogen is water, however during combustion with air [[NOx]] can be produced.

[[Honda]] introduced its fuel cell vehicle in 1999 called the [[Honda FCX|FCX]] and have since then introduced the second generation [[Honda FCX Clarity|FCX Clarity]].

A small number of prototype hydrogen cars currently exist, and a significant amount of research is underway to make the technology more viable.  The common [[internal combustion engine]], usually fueled with gasoline (petrol) or [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] liquids, can be converted to run on gaseous hydrogen.  However, the most efficient use of hydrogen involves the use of [[fuel cell]]s and [[electric motor]]s instead of a traditional engine.  Hydrogen reacts with [[oxygen]] inside the fuel cells, which produces electricity to power the motors.  One primary area of research is [[hydrogen storage]], to try to increase the range of hydrogen vehicles while reducing the weight, energy consumption, and complexity of the storage systems.  Two primary methods of storage are metal hydrides and compression.  Some believe that hydrogen cars will never be economically viable and that the emphasis on this technology is a diversion from the development and popularization of more efficient hybrid cars and other alternative technologies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

A study by [[The Carbon Trust]] for the UK [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]] suggests that hydrogen technologies have the potential to deliver UK transport with near-zero emissions whilst reducing dependence on imported oil and curtailment of renewable generation. However, the technologies face very difficult challenges, in terms of cost, performance and policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbontrust.com/news/2014/11/hydrogen-for-transport-tina "Hydrogen for transport"], ''[[The Carbon Trust]]'', 28 November 2014.

BMW's Clean Energy internal combustion hydrogen car has more power and is faster than hydrogen fuel cell electric cars. A limited series production of the 7 Series Saloon was announced as commencing at the end of 2006. A BMW hydrogen prototype (H2R) using the driveline of this model broke the speed record for hydrogen cars at 300&amp;nbsp;km/h (186&amp;nbsp;mi/h), making automotive history. Mazda has developed Wankel engines to burn hydrogen. The Wankel uses a rotary principle of operation, so the hydrogen burns in a different part of the engine from the intake. This reduces pre-detonation, a problem with hydrogen fueled piston engines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The other major car companies like Daimler, Chrysler, Honda, Toyota, Ford and General Motors, are investing in hydrogen fuel cells instead. VW, Nissan, and Hyundai/Kia also have fuel cell vehicle prototypes on the road. In addition, transit agencies across the globe are running prototype fuel cell buses.

=== Liquid nitrogen car ===
{{More citations needed|date=September 2008}}
{{Main|Liquid nitrogen vehicle}}
{{Further|Liquid nitrogen economy}}
Liquid nitrogen (LN2) is a method of storing energy. Energy is used to liquefy air, and then LN2 is produced by evaporation, and distributed. LN2 is exposed to ambient heat in the car and the resulting nitrogen gas can be used to power a piston or turbine engine. The maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from LN2 is 213 Watt-hours per kg (W·h/kg) or 173 W·h per liter, in which a maximum of 70 W·h/kg can be utilized with an isothermal expansion process. Such a vehicle with a 350-liter (93 gallon) tank can achieve ranges similar to a gasoline powered vehicle with a 50-liter (13 gallon) tank. Theoretical future engines, using cascading topping cycles, can improve this to around 110 W·h/kg with a quasi-isothermal expansion process. The advantages are zero harmful emissions and superior energy densities compared to a [[Compressed-air vehicle]] as well as being able to refill the tank in a matter of minutes.

=== Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) ===
{{Main|Natural gas vehicle}}
[[Liquefied natural gas]] is natural gas that has been cooled to a point at which it becomes a [[cryogenic]] liquid. In this liquid state, natural gas is more than 2 times as dense as highly compressed CNG. LNG fuel systems function on any vehicle capable of burning natural gas. Unlike CNG, which is stored at high pressure (typically 3000 or 3600 psi) and then regulated to a lower pressure that the engine can accept, LNG is stored at low pressure (50 to 150 psi) and simply vaporized by a heat exchanger before entering the fuel metering devices to the engine. Because of its high energy density compared to CNG, it is very suitable for those interested in long ranges while running on natural gas.

In the United States, the LNG supply chain is the main thing that has held back this fuel source from growing rapidly. The LNG supply chain is very analogous to that of diesel or gasoline. First, pipeline natural gas is liquefied in large quantities, which is analogous to refining gasoline or diesel. Then, the LNG is transported via semi trailer to fuel stations where it is stored in bulk tanks until it is dispensed into a vehicle. CNG, on the other hand, requires expensive compression at each station to fill the high-pressure cylinder cascades.

=== Autogas (LPG) ===
{{Main|Autogas}}
[[File:Propane powered blue bird vision.jpg|thumb|right|A propane-fueled [[school bus]] in the United States.]]
LPG or [[liquefied petroleum gas]] is a low pressure liquefied gas mixture composed mainly of propane and butane which burns in conventional gasoline combustion engines with less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than gasoline. Gasoline cars can be retrofitted to LPG aka Autogas and become bifuel vehicles as the gasoline tank stays. You can switch between LPG and gasoline during operation. Estimated 10 million vehicles running worldwide.

There are 17.473 million LPG powered vehicles worldwide as of December 2010, and the leading countries are Turkey (2.394 million vehicles), Poland (2.325 million), and South Korea (2.3 million).&lt;ref name=LPG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldlpgas.com/autogas/the-autogas-market |title=WLPGA: The Autogas Market |publisher=World LP Gas Association |accessdate=2012-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419182640/http://www.worldlpgas.com/autogas/the-autogas-market |archivedate=2013-04-19 |df= }} See table: Largest autogas markets, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., 190,000 on-road vehicles use propane,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://e85.whipnet.net/alt.fuel/propane.faq.html|title=Propane FAQ|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 450,000 forklifts use it for power.

=== Steam ===
[[Image:Cars-stanleysteamcar-amoswolfe.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Stanley Steamer|Stanley Steam Car]]]]
{{Main|Steam car}}
A steam car is a car that has a [[steam engine]]. Wood, coal, [[ethanol]], or others can be used as [[fuel]]. The fuel is burned in a [[boiler]] and the heat converts water into [[steam]]. When the water turns to steam, it expands. The expansion creates [[pressure]]. The pressure pushes the [[piston]]s back and forth. This turns the [[driveshaft]] to spin the wheels forward. It works like a coal-fueled [[steam train]], or [[steam boat]]. The steam car was the next logical step in independent transport.

Steam cars take a long time to start, but some can reach speeds over 100&amp;nbsp;mph (161&amp;nbsp;km/h) eventually.  The late model [[Doble steam car|Doble Steam Cars]] could be brought to operational condition in less than 30 seconds, had high top speeds and fast acceleration, but were expensive to buy.

A steam engine uses [[external combustion]], as opposed to internal combustion. Gasoline-powered cars are more efficient at about 25–28% [[Fuel efficiency|efficiency]]. In theory, a [[combined cycle]] steam engine in which the burning material is first used to drive a [[gas turbine]] can produce 50% to 60% efficiency. However, practical examples of steam engined cars work at only around 5–8% efficiency.

The best known and best selling steam-powered car was the [[Stanley Steamer]]. It used a compact fire-tube boiler under the hood to power a simple two-piston engine which was connected directly to the rear axle. Before [[Henry Ford]] introduced monthly payment financing with great success, cars were typically purchased outright. This is why the Stanley was kept simple; to keep the purchase price affordable.

Steam produced in [[refrigeration]] also can be use by a [[turbine]] in other vehicle types to produce electricity, that can be employed in electric motors or stored in a battery.

Steam power can be combined with a standard oil-based engine to create a hybrid. Water is injected into the cylinder after the fuel is burned, when the piston is still superheated, often at temperatures of 1500 degrees or more. The water will instantly be vaporized into steam, taking advantage of the heat that would otherwise be wasted.

=== Wood gas ===
[[Image:Gasogenog.jpg|thumb|200px|Vehicle with a gasifier]]
{{Main|Wood gas generator}}
[[Wood gas]] can be used to power cars with ordinary internal combustion engines if a [[wood gasifier]] is attached. This was quite popular during World War II in several European and Asian countries because the war prevented easy and cost-effective access to oil.
{{clear}}
Herb Hartman of Woodward, Iowa currently drives a wood powered Cadillac. He claims to have attached the gasifier to the Cadillac for just $700. Hartman claims, “A full hopper will go about fifty miles depending on how you drive it,” and he added that splitting the wood was “labor-intensive. That’s the big drawback.”&lt;ref&gt;http://thenewswheel.com/wood-powered-cadillac-cruises-past-gas-stations/ Timothy Walling-Moore "Wood-Powered Cadillac Cruises Past Gas Stations " The News Wheel June 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiple fuel source==

=== Dual Fuel ===
Dual fuel vehicle is referred as the vehicle using two types of fuel in the same time (can be gas + liquid, gas + gas, liquid + liquid) with different fuel tank.

Diesel-CNG Dual Fuel is a system using two type of fuel which are diesel and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) at the same time. It is because of CNG need a source of ignition for combustion in diesel engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.uthm.edu.my/8473/|title=Conversion method of a diesel engine to a CNG-diesel dual fuel engine and its financial savings|last=Mukhsin|first=Ismail, Muammar|last2=Hakim|first2=Zulkifli, Abd Fathul|date=April 2016|website=eprints.uthm.edu.my|access-date=2018-08-20|last3=Fawzi|first3=Mohd Ali, Mas|last4=Azmir|first4=Osman, Shahrul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flexible fuel ===
[[Image:Six full flex-fuel Brazilian automobiles 09 2008.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Six typical [[Brazil]]ian full flex-fuel models from several carmakers, popularly known as "flex" cars, that run on any blend of [[ethanol (fuel)|ethanol]] and gasoline(actually between [[w:common ethanol fuel mixtures#E20|E20-E25]] to [[Neat alcohol fuel|E100]]).]]
{{Main|Flexible-fuel vehicle}}{{See also|Neat ethanol vehicle}}
A [[flexible-fuel vehicle]] (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (DFF) is an alternative fuel automobile or [[light duty truck]] with a [[multifuel]] engine that can use more than one [[fuel]], usually mixed in the same tank, and the blend is burned in the [[combustion chamber]] together. These vehicles are [[colloquial]]ly called '''flex-fuel''', or '''flexifuel''' in Europe, or just flex in Brazil. FFVs are distinguished from [[bi-fuel vehicle]]s, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks. The most common commercially available FFV in the world market is the [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] [[flexible-fuel vehicle]], with the major markets concentrated in the United States, Brazil, Sweden, and some other European countries. In addition to flex-fuel vehicles running with [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]], in the US and Europe there were successful test programs with [[methanol fuel|methanol]] flex-fuel vehicles, known as [[methanol fuel#Methanol fuel programs in the U.S. and other nations|M85 FFVs]], and more recently there have been also successful tests using [[p-series fuels]] with E85 flex fuel vehicles, but as of June 2008, this fuel is not yet available to the general public.

Ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles have standard gasoline engines that are capable of running with [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] and gasoline mixed in the same tank.  These mixtures have "E" numbers which describe the percentage of ethanol in the mixture, for example, E85 is 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline. (See [[common ethanol fuel mixtures]] for more information.) Though technology exists to allow ethanol FFVs to run on any mixture up to E100,&lt;ref name="SusEthanol" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CleanCity"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/pdfs/41597.pdf  | title=Flexible Fuel Vehicles: Providing a Renewable Fuel Choice (Fact Sheet)|format=PDF| author=Clean Cities | publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |date=June 2008 | accessdate=2008-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. and Europe, flex-fuel vehicles are optimized to run on [[E85]]. This limit is set to avoid cold starting problems during very cold weather. The alcohol content might be reduced during the winter, to E70 in the U.S. or to E75 in Sweden. Brazil, with a warmer climate, developed vehicles that can run on any mix up to [[w:common ethanol fuel mixtures#E100|E100]], though [[w:common ethanol fuel mixtures#E20|E20-E25]] is the mandatory minimum blend, and no pure gasoline is sold in the country.

*The appearance of flex-fuel and non-flex-fuel vehicles is identical;
*There is no price difference between a pure-gasoline vehicle and its flex-fuel variant;
*The lack of consumer awareness of flex-fuel vehicles;
*The lack of promotion of flex-fuel vehicles by American automakers, who often do not label the cars or market them in the same way they do to [[hybrid cars]]

By contrast, automakers selling FFVs in Brazil commonly affix badges advertising the car as a flex-fuel vehicle. As of 2007, new FFV models sold in the U.S. were required to feature a yellow gas cap emblazoned with the label "E85/gasoline", in order to remind drivers of the cars' flex-fuel capabilities.&lt;ref name="NHTSA"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/autos/environment/2007-05-05-ethanolvehicles_N.htm| title= 'Flex-fuel' vehicles touted|publisher = [[USA Today]] | author=Ken Thomas | date=2007-05-07 | accessdate= 2008-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alternativefuels.about.com/od/vehiclebuyingguide/ig/Alt-fuels---New-York-Auto-Show/Yellow-E85-gas-cap.htm |title=Yellow E85 gas cap |publisher=About.com: Hybrid Cars &amp; Alt Fuels |author1=Christine Gable |author2=Scott Gable |accessdate=2008-09-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005054544/http://alternativefuels.about.com/od/vehiclebuyingguide/ig/Alt-fuels---New-York-Auto-Show/Yellow-E85-gas-cap.htm |archivedate=2008-10-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of E85 in the U.S. is also affected by the relatively low number of E85 filling stations in operation across the country, with just over 1,750 in August 2008,&lt;ref name="E85stat09"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.e85fuel.com/news/090808fyi.htm| title= New E85 Stations |publisher =  NEVC FYI Newsletter (Vol 14 issue 15) | author=National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition | date=2008-09-08 | accessdate= 2008-09-15 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080915042743/http://www.e85fuel.com/news/090808fyi.htm| archivedate= 15 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of which are concentrated in the [[Corn Belt]] states, led by [[Minnesota]] with 353 stations, followed by [[Illinois]] with 181, and [[Wisconsin]] with 114.&lt;ref name="E85stat"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.e85fuel.com/news/080808fyi.htm | title=New E85 Stations | publisher=NEVC FYI Newsletter (Vol 14 no. 13) | author=National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition | date=2008-08-08 | accessdate=2008-08-19 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010013636/http://www.e85fuel.com/news/080808fyi.htm | archive-date=2008-10-10 | dead-url=yes | df= }} ''For a complete and updated listing, go to www.e85refueling.com''&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, there are some 120,000 stations providing regular non-ethanol gasoline in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/econ/census02/data/us/US000_44.HTM#N447 |title=2002 Economic Census: Retail Trade - United States |publisher=Census.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been claims that American automakers are motivated to produce flex-fuel vehicles due to a [[loophole]] in the [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) requirements, which gives the automaker a "fuel economy credit" for every flex-fuel vehicle sold, whether or not the vehicle is actually fueled with E85 in regular use.&lt;ref name="Apollo" /&gt; This loophole allegedly allows the U.S. auto industry to meet CAFE fuel economy targets not by developing more fuel-efficient models, but by spending between US$100 and US$200 extra per vehicle to produce a certain number of flex-fuel models, enabling them to continue selling less fuel-efficient vehicles such as [[Sport Utility Vehicle|SUVs]], which netted higher profit margins than smaller, more fuel-efficient cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/business/2008/06/as_buyers_shun_suvs_expect_to.html |title=As buyers shun SUVs, expect to pay more for that small car - Cleveland Business News |publisher=Blog.cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10551762| title= Bumpy ride for biofuels|publisher = The Economist | date=2008-01-18 | accessdate= 2008-09-14 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081027040134/http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10551762| archivedate= 27 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[E85]] FFVs are equipped with sensor that automatically detect the fuel mixture, signaling the ECU to tune spark timing and fuel injection so that fuel will burn cleanly in the vehicle's internal combustion engine. Originally, the sensors were mounted in the fuel line and exhaust system; more recent models do away with the fuel line sensor. Another feature of older flex-fuel cars is a small separate gasoline storage tank that was used for starting the car on cold days, when the ethanol mixture made ignition more difficult.

Modern [[Brazil]]ian flex-fuel technology enables FFVs to run an any blend between [[w:common ethanol fuel mixtures#E20|E20-E25]] [[gasohol]] and [[Neat alcohol fuel|E100 ethanol fuel]], using a [[oxygen sensor|lambda probe]] to measure the quality of combustion, which informs the [[engine control unit]] as to the exact composition of the gasoline-alcohol mixture. This technology, developed by the Brazilian subsidiary of [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] in 1994, and further improved and commercially implemented in 2003 by the Italian subsidiary of [[Magneti Marelli]], is known as "[[Software Fuel Sensor]]". The Brazilian subsidiary of [[Delphi (auto parts)|Delphi Automotive Systems]] developed a similar technology, known as "[[Multifuel (Delphi)|Multifuel]]", based on research conducted at its facility in [[Piracicaba]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]].&lt;ref name="VejaFlex"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/010206/p_096.html |title=A riqueza é o saber|author =João Gabriel de Lima|publisher=[[Veja (magazine)|Revista Veja]]|date=2006-02-01|accessdate=2008-08-19|language=Portuguese| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080905045523/http://veja.abril.com.br/010206/p_096.html| archivedate= 5 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}} Print edition No. 1941&lt;/ref&gt; This technology allows the controller to regulate the amount of fuel injected and spark time, as fuel flow needs to be decreased to avoid [[detonation]] due to the high compression ratio (around 12:1) used by flex-fuel engines.

=== Hybrids ===

====Hybrid electric vehicle====

{{Main|Hybrid vehicle|Hybrid electric vehicle}}

A [[hybrid vehicle]] uses multiple propulsion systems to provide motive power. The most common type of hybrid vehicle is the [[hybrid electric vehicle|gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle]]s, which use gasoline (petrol) and electric batteries for the energy used to power [[internal-combustion engine]]s (ICEs) and electric motors. These motors are usually relatively small and would be considered "underpowered" by themselves, but they can provide a normal driving experience when used in combination during acceleration and other maneuvers that require greater power.

==Comparative assessment of fossil and alternative fuels==

[[File:Well to Wheels (kWh).svg|450px|thumb|right|Different fuel pathways require different amounts of energy to drive 100 km. From left to right: Coal to electricity to electrical car. Renewable energy (e.g. wind or photovoltaics) to electrical car. Renewable energy to hydrogen to hydrogen-powered car. Petroleum to diesel to internal combustion engine.]]

According to a recent comparative energy and environmental analysis of the vehicle fuel end use (petroleum and natural gas derivatives &amp; hydrogen; biofuels like ethanol or biodiesel, and their mixtures; as well as electricity intended to be used in [[plug-in electric vehicles]]), the renewable and non-renewable unit energy costs and CO2 emission cost are suitable indicators for assessing the renewable energy consumption intensity and the environmental impact, and for quantifying the thermodynamic performance of the transportation sector. This analysis allows ranking the energy conversion processes along the vehicle fuels production routes and their end-use, so that the best options for the transportation sector can be determined and better energy policies may be issued. Thus, if a drastic CO2 emissions abatement of the transportation sector is pursued, a more intensive utilization of ethanol in the Brazilian transportation sector mix is advisable. However, as the overall exergy conversion efficiency of the sugar cane industry is still very low, which increases the unit energy cost of ethanol, better production and end-use technologies are required. Nonetheless, with the current scenario of a predominantly renewable Brazilian electricity mix, based on more than 80% of renewable sources, this source consolidates as the most promising energy source to reduce the large amount of greenhouse gas emissions which transportation sector is responsible for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890415004380|title=Exergy and environmental comparison of the end use of vehicle fuels: The Brazilian case|author = Flórez-Orrego, Daniel|accessdate=2015-05-19|doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2015.04.074|volume=100|journal=Energy Conversion and Management|pages=220–231|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''American Ninja Warrior''''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''ANW''') is an American [[sports entertainment]] competition that is a spin-off of the Japanese television series ''[[Sasuke (TV series)|Sasuke]]''. It features hundreds of competitors attempting to complete a series of [[obstacle course]]s of increasing difficulty in various cities across the United States, in hopes of advancing to the national finals on the [[Las Vegas Strip]], in hopes of becoming an "American Ninja Warrior".

To date only two competitors, rock-climbers [[Isaac Caldiero]] and [[Geoff Britten]], have finished the course and achieved "Total Victory". Caldiero is the only competitor to win the cash prize. The series premiered on December 12, 2009 on the now-defunct cable channel [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] and now airs on [[NBC]] with encore episodes airing on [[USA Network]] and [[NBCSN]], [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]], and [[Esquire Network]].

==Series overview==
''American Ninja Warrior'' succeeded [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]]'s ''[[American Ninja Challenge]]'' as the qualifying route for Americans to enter ''[[Sasuke (TV series)|Sasuke]]''. Beginning with the [[American Ninja Warrior (season 4)|fourth season]] in 2012, regional finalists and wild card competitors competed on a nearly identical Mount Midoriyama course in Las Vegas, Nevada, rather than traveling to Japan to compete on ''Sasuke''.

===Hosts and co-hosts===
[[Image:American Ninja Warrior broadcaster position Indianapolis 2016.jpg|thumb|left|The broadcast position for [[Matt Iseman]] and [[Akbar Gbaja-Biamila]], seen here in season eight.]]
''American Ninja Warrior'' was originally hosted by G4's American television personality [[Blair Herter]], and actress and former television correspondent [[Alison Haislip]]. In the second season, American actor, comedian, and television host [[Matt Iseman]] joined the show, replacing Herter.&lt;ref name="Evolution 1–4"/&gt; Additionally, Jimmy Smith was brought in as a co-host, while Haislip was the sideline reporter. The panel remained the same throughout season three.

For season four, skier [[Jonny Moseley]] was brought in as the new co-host, replacing Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hosting Resume|url=http://jonnymoseley.com/?page_id=740|website=jonnymoseley.com|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; American journalist, sportscaster, and documentary filmmaker [[Angela Sun]] replaced Haislip.

For season five, two newcomers were added. Sports analyst and former [[National Football League|NFL]] football player [[Akbar Gbaja-Biamila]] replaced Moseley, while [[ESPN]] sportscaster and model [[Jenn Brown]] replaced Sun as sideline reporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hibberd|first1=James|title='American Ninja Warrior' returning with new hosts|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/04/08/american-ninja-warrior-returning|accessdate=October 24, 2015|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=April 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season five panel remained the same through the sixth season.

For season seven, [[CBS Sports]] reporter [[Kristine Leahy]] joined the show as the new sideline reporter, replacing Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lesley Goldberg |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/american-ninja-warrior-taps-new-780858 |title='American Ninja Warrior' Taps New Co-Host for Season 7.

===City qualifying and finals===
[[File:American Ninja Warrior Course at Public Square (34093093854).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[American Ninja Warrior (season 9)|Season nine]] [[Cleveland]] city course filming view from [[Terminal Tower]], looking out to [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]]. ]]

In each city qualifier course, the competitors that the producers have selected compete on an obstacle course consisting of six obstacles. Descriptions of each obstacle in each course are provided by the sideline reporter at the beginning of an episode.

At the beginning of each run, a buzzer sounds off, allowing a competitor to begin the course. A timer begins simultaneously. The first obstacle on any city qualifying course is the quintuple steps or floating steps, in which competitors must run across. This is followed by four different obstacles that test a competitors balance, upper-body strength and grip. These five obstacles are built above water. If a competitor falls into the water or touches it, their run ends immediately and the timer records their time.

Until season nine, the sixth and final obstacle was the 14'6" warped wall, in which competitors are given three chances to reach the top. In season ten, the  18-foot "Mega Wall" was introduced adjacent to the warped wall. Competitors have only one attempt to reach the top of the Mega Wall, and if successful, will win $10,000. However, if unsuccessful, the competitor will only get one attempt at the warped wall. Competitors are given the choice of which to climb.

At the top of both walls, there is a buzzer a competitor presses which stops the timer and records their time, ending their run on the course. The top 30 competitors who go the farthest the fastest advance to the city finals course. Since season nine, the top five women also advance to the city finals, regardless if they finished in the top 30.

City finals courses are the follow-up to each city qualifying course. They contain four new obstacles, in addition to the six obstacles featured in the city qualifying course. These four obstacles are all placed after the original six obstacles. As of season ten, two of the original six obstacles are replaced with new obstacles for the city finals course.

The top 15 competitors who go the farthest the fastest from each city finals course move on to compete on the National Finals course. As of season nine, the top two women in each city finals course also move on to compete on the National Finals course, even if they do not finish in the top 15. Small prizes ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 are awarded to first, second, and third finishers who complete the city finals course.&lt;ref name="Season8Changes"/&gt;

Qualifying and finals courses are filmed back-to-back, usually over two nights. Obstacles are designed and produced in the five months prior to an episode taping, with 3–4 new ones per city. In season eight, 18 obstacles were debuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Nikki |title=The fine points of American Ninja Warrior course evolution |url=https://www.americanninjawarriornation.com/2017/1/10/14148190/the-fine-points-of-american-ninja-warrior-course-evolution |website=American Ninja Warrior Nation |accessdate=August 5, 2018 |date=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finals===

The National Finals takes place at "Mount Midoriyama", the final course for ''American Ninja Warrior''. Located on the [[Las Vegas Strip]], it consists of four stages, each containing various obstacles of increasing difficulty. Competitors must complete all of the 23 obstacles. Should they complete the first three stages, competitors will advance to Stage 4, where competitors attempt to climb the 75-foot rope climb, known as Mount Midoriyama, in 30 seconds or less.&lt;ref name=FutonFirstWinner&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC's "American Ninja Warrior"  Makes History with First Winner|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2015/09/14/nbcs-american-ninja-warrior-makes-history-with-first-winner-696201/20150914nbc05/|accessdate=October 20, 2015|work=The Futon Critic|publisher=Futon Media|date=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Should a competitor achieve Total Victory, he or she receives a money prize of $500,000 from season four to season six, and $1,000,000 from season seven. Beginning in season eight, if multiple competitors complete stage 4, the competitors split the prize money, although in prior years the fastest competitor would receive the full amount.&lt;ref name="Season8Changes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garofalo|first1=Alex|title=‘American Ninja Warrior’ Season 8’s Biggest Obstacle: Compensation For The Athletes|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/american-ninja-warrior-season-8s-biggest-obstacle-compensation-athletes-2376650|accessdate=June 1, 2016|work=IBTimes|date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Stage 1''' consists of obstacles that test the competitors' agility and speed. The first stage is timed, and only the competitors who successfully complete it within the time limit of 2:35 will advance to Stage 2.
*'''Stage 2''' consists of obstacles that test the competitors' strength and speed. Competitors must complete challenges that strain their upper-body strength (such as the Salmon Ladder) without running out of time. Just as in the first stage, only the competitors who successfully finish within the time limit of 4:00 move on to Stage 3.
*'''Stage 3''' consists of obstacles that test the competitors' upper body and grip strength. It is the only stage in Mt. Midoriyama that has no time limit. Like Stages 1 and 2, only the competitors who successfully complete Stage 3 move on.
*'''Stage 4''' of Mt. Midoriyama is a 75-foot rope climb. Competitors must complete the rope climb and hit the buzzer in under 30 seconds.

==Season synopses==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2015}}

===Season 1 (2009)===
The first season of ''American Ninja Warrior'' was held in Los Angeles, where hundreds of competitors came to challenge themselves against the course and qualify for a shot at making it to Japan to compete in ''Sasuke 23'' later in the year. The special premiered on December 12, 2009, on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4 TV]] and was hosted by G4's [[Blair Herter]] and [[Alison Haislip]]. Notable competitors this season included [[Freerunning|freerunners]] Levi Meeuwenberg and Brian Orosco, [[mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]] [[Jason "Mayhem" Miller]], and Hollywood [[stunt performer|stuntman]] Rich King. Along with competitors on every season, Lorin Ball, Brian Kretsch, Ryan Stratis, and [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]].

Out of the ten Americans who qualified to compete at Mount Midori in Japan, only Rich King, Levi Meeuwenberg and Brian Orosco successfully completed Stage 1. The majority of the ''American Ninja Warrior'' competitors ran out of time or failed the obstacles. Levi Meeuwenberg was the only American competitor to complete Stage 2. The sole American competitor on Stage 3 fell on the "Shin-Cliffhanger" and his run came to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When is the Premiere Date of American Ninja Warrior Season 8?|url=http://waitwith.us/american-ninja-warrior-season-8-2229/|website=waitwith.us|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|American Ninja Warrior (season 2)}}

The second season premiered on December 8, 2010, on G4, and concluded on December 23, 2010 after 10 episodes. The city qualifiers were held near the beach in [[Venice, California]], where 300 competitors took on the qualifiers course. 30 competitors advanced to the city finals course. The top 15 competitors in the city finals course then moved on to participate in "Ninja Warrior Boot Camp" in [[Simi Valley]], where they competed in a series of team challenges for five days. The 10 finalists then moved on to compete in the season finale as part of ''Sasuke 26'' in Japan. Five competitors completed Stage 1, while four competitors completed Stage 2. No competitor made it beyond Stage 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Hare |first=Kate |authorlink= |year=2011 |url=http://www.zap2it.com/news/zap-american-ninja-warrior-story,0,6762144.story |title='American Ninja Warrior' storms Japan's Mount Midoriyama |work= |publisher=Zap2it |accessdate=August 6, 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913231545/http://www.zap2it.com/news/zap-american-ninja-warrior-story%2C0%2C6762144.story |archivedate=September 13, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]] was the Last Ninja Standing, having gone the farthest the fastest among the American competitors in ''Sasuke 26''.&lt;ref name="Evolution 1–4"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Nikki |title=The evolution of American Ninja Warrior: Seasons 1-4 |url=https://www.americanninjawarriornation.com/2018/5/30/17345724/evolution-of-american-ninja-warrior-arthur-smith-kent-weed-seasons-1-4 |website=American Ninja Warrior Nation |accessdate=August 6, 2018 |date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the tryouts, the top 15 competitors competed in Ninja Warrior Boot Camp with the top 10 moving on to Japan for the finals of the competition as a part of ''Sasuke 27'' and a chance at becoming the first American to conquer the course and win a $500,000 endorsement deal with [[K-Swiss]]. No competitors made it beyond Stage 3.

===Season 4 (2012)===
[[Image:American Ninja Warrior entrance auditions Venice Beach 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Competitor auditions being filmed at the entrance of the Northwest Regional in Venice Beach, California during season 4.]] 
{{Main|American Ninja Warrior (season 4)}}
The fourth season of ''American Ninja Warrior'' began airing on May 20, 2012, on both G4 and NBC. There were six regional competitions held in three locations: Venice Beach (Southwest and Northwest), Dallas (Midwest and Midsouth), and Miami (Northeast and Southeast), that determined the 100 competitors to participate in the qualifying rounds. The winner of the ''ANW'' season four competition would receive $500,000 and the coveted "American Ninja Warrior" title. The season finale, held in Las Vegas, was the first time that Mount Midori was held on U.S. soil. Submission videos for ''American Ninja Warrior'' season 4 had been collected since January 25, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/01/24/g4-and-nbc-partner-to-broadcast-new-season-of-american-ninja-warrior/117468/|title=G4 and NBC Partner to Broadcast New Season of ‘American Ninja Warrior’ - Ratings - TVbytheNumbers.Zap2it.com|work=TVbytheNumbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire format was changed as well – regional qualifiers in different parts of the country were aired, and the Mt. Midori course was recreated just off the Las Vegas Strip for the national finals. The regional qualifiers would narrow down its selections down to 30 contestants who finished its qualifying course in the fastest time as well as the contestants who finished the furthest the fastest. Qualifying obstacles would include common Stage 1 obstacles such as the Quintuple steps and the Warped wall, but its contents would change from city to city. The 30 contestants were then cut in half in the regional finals where the course would extend to include common Stage 2 and Stage 3 obstacles such as the Salmon Ladder, Cliffhanger and Body Prop. The 100 contestants who qualified (including wild cards) earned tickets to Las Vegas to challenge Mt. Midori. Brent Steffensen was the first American to defeat the Ultimate Cliffhanger on Stage 3, and he made it the farthest that season, falling on the Hang Climb. He was the only competitor to reach Stage 3 in this competition.

===Season 5 (2013)===
{{Main|American Ninja Warrior (season 5)}}
The fifth season of ''American Ninja Warrior'' premiered on June 30, 2013, on G4 with subsequent shows airing on NBC and G4.&lt;ref name="S5"&gt;{{cite news|title=''American Ninja Warrior''|url=http://www.nbcumv.com/mediavillage/networks/nbcentertainment/americanninjawarrior/publisher=Nbcumv.com|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the sideboard advertising along the course listed [[Esquire Network]] as the broadcaster as the fifth season was to premiere after G4's transition to Esquire on April 22, 2013. The network switch was eventually delayed to September 23, 2013, and Esquire took over Style Network's channel space instead. Because of this, additional reruns of the season aired on Saturday nights on NBC through the summer to maintain ratings momentum due to G4's [[:wikt:lame duck|lame duck]] status, with ''ANW'' being their only new program since they wound down all their original programming in January 2013. The success of the NBC re-airings led to the series being considered for NBC's main summer schedule for the next season.

Regional competitions were held in Venice Beach, Baltimore, Miami, and Denver. Tryouts for the season began in February 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ishimoto|first=Moye|title=American Ninja Warrior Tryouts Begin -- Calling All Aspiring Ninjas For Season 5!|url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/730047/american-ninja-warrior-tryouts-begin-calling-all-aspiring-ninjas-for-season-5/|work=[[G4 Media]]|publisher=The Feed|accessdate=July 23, 2013|date=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ended with the last of the regional rounds taking place the following May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finals for 'American Ninja Warrior' Denver auditions slated for Monday night |url=http://www.9news.com/news/article/337082/222/Finals-for-American-Ninja-Warrior-Denver-auditions-slated-for-Monday-night |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130723191017/http://www.9news.com/news/article/337082/222/Finals-for-American-Ninja-Warrior-Denver-auditions-slated-for-Monday-night |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 23, 2013 |work=[[Gannett Company]] |publisher=[[KUSA (TV)]] |accessdate=July 23, 2013 |date=May 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The finale was once again held in Las Vegas. No one defeated Stage 3, but Brian Arnold fell on the last obstacle, the Flying Bar, making him the farthest-going American on the Mount Midori course since [[Kane Kosugi]] reached the final stage on [[List of Sasuke competitions#8th competition|''Sasuke 8'']].

===Season 6 (2014)===

Notable competitors this season included ''[[The Biggest Loser]]'' personal trainer [[Kim Lyons (personal trainer)|Kim Lyons]], U.S. Olympic gymnasts [[Jonathan Horton]] and [[Terin Humphrey]], among others. Female competitor [[Kacy Catanzaro]] became the first female to make it up the "Warped Wall" in the Dallas Qualifiers. Later in the Dallas Finals, she became the first woman to complete that finals course, in 8 minutes, 59 seconds. Again, no competitor achieved "total victory". Kacy's run has over ten million views. [[Joe Moravsky]], the "Weatherman", made it farther than anyone on season six, falling on the Hang Climb, where Brent Steffensen failed two years ago.

===Season 7 (2015)===

{{Main|American Ninja Warrior (season 7)}}
The seventh season of ''American Ninja Warrior'' premiered on NBC on May 25, 2015. This season's grand prize was increased from $500,000 to $1,000,000.

Only eight were remaining in Stage 3 including Drew Dreschel, Abel Gonzalez, Isaac Caldiero, Ian Dory, Jeremiah Morgan, Kevin Bull, Joe Moravsky and Geoff Britten. Only two competitors finished the course: Isaac Caldiero and Geoff Britten. It was the first time that any American had finished Stage 3. The season concluded with a victory: Geoff Britten was the first to complete Stage 4 with a second remaining; however, Isaac Caldiero achieved the Stage 4 rope climb in a faster time and was awarded the grand prize of $1,000,000 and the title of "American Ninja Warrior". Geoff Britten was the first Ninja to complete all six courses in a single season.

{{Main|American Ninja Warrior (season 8)}}

Season eight of ''American Ninja Warrior'' began on June 1, 2016, on NBC, with encore episodes airing the following day on Esquire Network. Regional competitions were held in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Indianapolis, Oklahoma City, and Philadelphia, with 28 new obstacles. Over 40 percent more women registered for season eight compared to the previous season. Additionally, prize money for possible Stage 4 winners would now be split equally among competitors who complete the rope climb in under 30 seconds.&lt;ref name="Season8Changes"/&gt;

In Philadelphia's city finals, no competitors completed the finals course, a first in ''American Ninja Warrior'' history. In Stage 1 of the National Finals, many veterans of the show such as Geoff Britten and Brent Steffensen were eliminated early, while [[Jessie Graff]] became the first woman to complete Stage 1, placing fifth.&lt;ref name="stage1results"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnes|first1=Katie|title=Night 2 of 'American Ninja Warrior' Vegas finals made Jessie Graff's run shine even brighter|url=http://www.espn.com/espnw/culture/article/17475655/night-2-american-ninja-warrior-finals-vegas-made-jessie-graff-run-shine-even-brighter|accessdate=September 10, 2016|work=espn.com/espnw|date=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyler Yamauchi became the shortest person ever to complete the Jumping Spider obstacle at 5'1".

===Season 9 (2017)===
{{Main|American Ninja Warrior (season 9)}}

Season  nine of ''American Ninja Warrior'' began on June 12, 2017, on NBC; Esquire Network ended operations fifteen days later on June 27, thus encore episodes shifted over to [[NBCSN]] on non-event nights with this season. The premiere was preceded by a special episode, "Celebrity Ninja Warrior" on May 25, 2017, the U.S. [[Red Nose Day]], which was followed by a "USA vs. the World" special on June 4. New for season nine, the top five women in each city qualifying course qualified for the city finals course, and the top two women in each city finals qualified for national finals, regardless of their placement overall. Also this season, fans were given the opportunity to design their own obstacles through ''ANW Obstacle Design Challenge'' and seven fan-submitted obstacles have been featured on the show.

In the national finals, a record 41 competitors successfully completed Stage 1, including Allyssa Beird, the second woman to complete Stage 1. On Stage 2, all athletes were eliminated except [[Joe Moravsky]], Sean Bryan and  Najee Richardson. During Stage 3, none of the three could complete the course. Richardson and Bryan fell on the Ultimate Cliffhanger, while Moravsky went the farthest, but failed Time Bomb. As in season eight, no competitor was able to complete Stage 3.

===Season 10 (2018)===

====2016====
On May 29, 2016, prior to the premiere of [[American Ninja Warrior (season 8)|season eight]], NBC aired a two-hour all-star special in which hosts [[Matt Iseman]] and [[Akbar Gbaja-Biamila]] chose their own all-star teams composed of three veterans, one rookie, and one woman. Teams competed on stages two, three, and four of the regular season finals course, Mt. Midoriyama, as well as competitions on a supersized course by testing their skills in competitions on the giant pegboard, 40-foot Salmon Ladder, Flying Shelf Grab, and Jump Hang, concluding with a race to the top of the "Mega" Warped Wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="AMERICAN NINJA WARRIOR"  (X) "ALL STARS" ORIGINAL"|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20160505nbc01/|website=The Futon Critic|accessdate=May 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The all-star winners were '''Team Akbar''' who won the team competition, beating Team Matt 5-3. Additionally, competitor Joe Moravsky completed Stage 2 in a record time of 1:08:52.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Polacek|first1=Scott|title=American Ninja Warrior 2016 Results: Recap from May 29 Episode|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2643157-american-ninja-warrior-2016-results-recap-from-may-29-episode|website=BleacherReport.com|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017====
On February 20, 2017, NBC aired a second two-hour all-star special. Like the previous year's competition, ''ANW'' hosts [[Matt Iseman]] and [[Akbar Gbaja-Biamila]] chose their own all-star teams, this year composed of one veteran, one breakout star, and one woman. Team Matt featured Chris Wilczewski, Najee Richardson, and Jesse "Flex" Lebreck. Team Akbar featured Grant McCartney, Neil "Crazy" Craver, and Meagan Martin. Also, sideline interviewer [[Kristine Leahy]] got to pick her own team, which consisted of Jessie Graff, Flip Rodriguez, and Nicholas Coolridge. Teams competed as a relay race to finish sections of stages one, two, and three of the regular season finals course, Mt. Midoriyama. Next, was the skills competition on a supersized course where individual contestants tested their skills in competition on the 75-feet tall Endless Invisible Ladder, the 4-story high Super Salmon Ladder, Supersonic Shelf Grab, Striding Steps, and the Mega Wall, which is now 20 feet high.

The all-star winners were '''Team Kristine''', who won the team relay race competition, beating Team Matt and last year's champions Team Akbar. Their highlight of the night was completing Stage 3 in a record time of 5:30:62, making this the ''[[POM Wonderful]]'' Run of the Night.

====2018====

On May 17, 2018, NBC aired a third two-hour all-star special. Like the last two seasons' competition, ''ANW'' hosts [[Matt Iseman]] and [[Akbar Gbaja-Biamila]], along with [[Kristine Leahy]], chose their own all-star teams, composed of two male veterans, and one female veteran. The reigning champs, Team Kristine (gray/pink) featured: Jessie Graff, Flip Rodriguez, and J.J. Woods. Team Matt (blue) featured: Jamie Rahn, Lance Pekus, and Jesse LaBreck. However, Team Akbar featured first-time all-stars: Allyssa Beird, Jon Alexis Jr., and Tyler Yamauchi.

For the first half of the special, the athletes competed individuality, earning "skills medals". First was the "Skills Competition", which consisted of who can make it up the Super Salmon Ladder, 4 stories high and 35 rungs in the fastest time. '''Winner:''' Sean Bryan (19.39). And a test of how far the all-star ninjas can fly on the Wicked Wingnuts obstacle. '''Winner:''' Drew Drechsel (20 feet). They tested their upper body strength by racing head-to-head on the Thunderbolt. '''Winner:''' Jamie Rahn. Then, it was a speed and balance challenge on the Striding Steps. '''Winner:''' Jake Murray (28.76) This year, ''ANW'' debuted a new obstacle, the Mega Spider Climb, where the eight women all-stars raced side-by-side 80 feet up to the top of the Stage 4 tower. '''Winner:''' Jessie Graff, who won the tournament-style Stage 4 competition in a time of 24:03, making this the ''[[POM Wonderful]]'' Run of the Night.

The second half showcased the team competition: Stage 1 featured a relay race through the obstacles course. First racer goes through Snake Run, Propeller Bar and Double Dipper. Next racer tackles the Jumping Spider, Parkour Run and the Warped Wall. And the anchor runs through the Domino Pipes, and the Flying Squirrel. The other two teams compete on Stage 2 for the other spot in the finals. Team Kristine won Stage 1 and got a bye into Stage 3. Stage 2 featured the Giant Ring Swing, Criss Cross Salmon Ladder, Wave Runner, Swing Surfer, Wingnut Alley and the Wall Flip. Team Matt won and moved onto Stage 3, which featured Floating Boards, Key Lock Hang, the Nail Clipper, Ultimate Cliffhanger, the Body Prop, Peg Cloud, the Time Bomb and the Floating Bar.

The all-star winners were once again '''Team Kristine''', who won the team relay race competition with a time of 6:12.06, beating Team Matt by only 5 seconds (6:17.96).

==''ANW'' competitors in other competitions==
{{more citations needed|date=June 2018}}
Following the inception of ''American Ninja Warrior'', ''ANW'' competitors have also continued to enter other obstacle course competitions around the world, including ''Sasuke'':

* Drew Dreschel won the Sasuke [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] Open Cup in 2014 in Kuala Lumpur and has advanced to Stage 3 at ''Sasuke'' six straight times (''Sasuke 30-35'').
* Brent Steffensen advanced to Stage 3 at ''Sasuke 32'', going out on the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger.

On October 9, 2015, [[Esquire Network]] announced a spin-off of ''American Ninja Warrior'' which would feature 24 three-person teams (two men and one woman) of popular ''ANW'' alumni, initially titled ''Team Ninja Warrior''. The teams compete head-to-head against each other, running the course simultaneously, thus creating a new live duel dynamic (including crossing points where the two competitors can affect the other's progress.) The two teams with the fastest times advance to the finale where one team will be crowned the winners and receive a cash prize.

On May 2, 2018, the second spin-off of ''American Ninja Warrior'', entitled ''American Ninja Warrior Junior'', was announced. Set to premiere on [[Universal Kids]] on October 13, 2018, [[Matt Iseman]] and [[Akbar Gbaja-Biamila]] will reprise their roles from ''ANW'' as hosts, with Olympic 2016 gold medalist [[Laurie Hernandez]] joining as co-host, guiding competitors in head-to-head challenges. The series will feature 200 kids age 9–14 competing along a course of miniature, kid-friendly ''ANW'' obstacles such as the warped wall. Similar to ''ANW'', males and females will run along the same course, and similarly to ''Ninja vs. Ninja'' and ''College Madness'', competitors compete head-to-head. However, they will be divided into three age groups: 9–10, 11–12 and 13–14,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dickson |first1=Jeremy |title=Universal Kids runs with American Ninja Warrior Junior |url=http://kidscreen.com/2018/05/02/universal-kids-runs-with-american-ninja-warrior-junior/ |website=Kidscreen |accessdate=June 29, 2018 |date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with each category coached by fan-favorite athletes: Drew Dreschel, Kevin Bull, Natalie Duran,  Meagan Martin, Najee Richardson, and Barclay Stockett.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/american-ninja-warrior-junior-premiere-date-adds-laurie-hernadez-1202883280/|title=‘American Ninja Warrior Junior’ Sets Premiere Date, Adds Olympian Laurie Hernandez as Co-Host (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Otterson|first=Joe|date=2018-07-25|work=Variety|access-date=2018-07-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Analbeads.JPG|thumb|Anal beads]]
[[Image:Anal beads.jpg|thumb|Rigid beads]]

'''Anal beads''' are a [[sex toy]] consisting of multiple spheres or balls attached together in series which are continuously inserted through the [[anus]] into the [[rectum]] and then removed with varying speeds depending on the desired effect (commonly at [[orgasm]] to enhance climax). Anal bead users enjoy the pleasurable feeling of the ball passing through the narrow [[Sphincter ani externus muscle|sphincter]] of the anus.

== Design ==
Anal beads are available in many sizes, with individual beads measuring from 25 mm in diameter to 125 mm diameter or larger. Most users enjoy beads of approximately 45 mm, but most will become more adventurous with experience, and try larger sizes.  Anal beads are commonly made of [[silicone]], [[plastic]], [[rubber]], [[latex]], [[glass]] or [[metal]] and end with a ring or similar handle designed for pulling. The purpose of this ring is to prevent the beads from becoming fully lodged in the rectum, and to ease removal. The beads may either be joined flexibly, requiring individual insertion, or by a semi-rigid thin shaft, allowing anal insertion in a single motion. Both arrangements are forms of the sexual art of "beading off".

The many nerve endings of the sphincter provide arousal both during insertion and removal, and larger beads may create feelings of pressure while in the rectum.

Some anal beads are enhanced with vibration technology to enhance pleasure.

== Use ==
[[File:Illustration of anal bead use.svg|thumb|Illustration of anal bead use]]
Anal beads can be incorporated into many fetishes that involve [[anal sex]], [[Body worship|ass worship]], [[Erotic spanking|spanking]], [[enema]]s or anything involving the buttocks, anus, or the anal area.

As with all anal sexual activity, the anal beads and the rectum should be well-lubricated with a [[sexual lubricant]] intended for  anal sex.  It is important to do this as the rectum can be easily ripped, torn or injured. Anal sex toys should be well washed with warm soapy water and left to dry naturally after use.  Alternatively, they can be placed inside a [[condom]], which is recommended if they are shared with a partner.

Care must also be taken to count the beads before and after use to ensure they are all removed from the anus. String have reportedly broken during intense rectal movements.  If a bead gets stuck in the rectum and cannot be expelled naturally, medical intervention may be necessary.

== Safety ==
If the beads are threaded onto a string, which is a porous material, they cannot be fully disinfected. They should not be shared between partners without using a physical barrier such as a latex or neoprene condom to prevent the transfer of [[faeces]]. Sharing unsterilized anal toys can expose users to various [[sexually transmitted diseases]].

'''Andrew Pritchard''' [[FRSE]] (14 December 1804 – 24 November 1882) was an English naturalist and [[natural history]] dealer who made significant improvements to [[microscopy]] and studied microscopic organisms. His belief that God and nature were one led him to the [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], a religious movement to which he and his family devoted much energy. He became a leading member of [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]] in [[north London]], and worked to build a school there.

==Early life==
Andrew Pritchard was born in [[Hackney Central|Hackney]], then a village just north of [[London]] on 14 December 1804, the son of John Pritchard and his wife, Ann Fleetwood. He was educated at [[St Saviour's Grammar School]] in [[Southwark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pritchard was apprenticed to his cousin [[Cornelius Varley]], an artist deeply interested in science. For his improvements in the ''[[camera lucida]]'', the ''[[camera obscura]]'' and the [[microscope]], he received the [[Isis Gold Medal]] of the [[Society of Arts]] and later, at the [[Great Exhibition]], he gained a medal for his invention of the [[graphic telescope]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=921,922}} Cornelius's brother was the painter [[John Varley (painter)|John Varley]], but Pritchard would have seen more of Cornelius's son [[C. F. Varley|Cromwell Fleetwood Varley]], an engineer who pioneered the [[transatlantic telegraph cable]].

==Microscopy==
Pritchard set up as an optician, and also sold [[microscopes]] and microslide preparations. These slides he prepared by studying the microscopic organisms that he saw, and identifying and labelling them. Starting in 1830, he collaborated with C.R. Goring to produce beautifully illustrated books showing the "[[animalcules]]" visible through the microscope. His shops were in [[central London]], more towards [[City of London|The City]] than the [[West End of London|West End]], variously at 162 [[Fleet Street]], Pickett Street and 312 &amp; 263 [[Strand, London|The Strand]]. The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' says his ''List of 2000 Microscopic Objects'' (1835) "is very important in the history of microscopy... his ''History of the Infusoria'' (1841) was long a [[reference work|standard work]], and the impetus it gave to the study of biological science cannot be overestimated." ("[[Infusoria]]" is a term then current for aquatic micro-organisms.) This latter book was enlarged and revised by [[John Ralfs]] and other botanists; Pritchard in turn condensed Ralfs's contribution on the diatomaceæ ([[diatom]]s, a type of [[phytoplankton]]), and wrote many books and articles on "natural history as seen through the microscope, on optical instruments, and on patents"&lt;ref&gt;ONDB article&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious ties==
Pritchard held various [[Dissenters|Dissenting]] religious views over his lifetime, holding that [[Relationship between religion and science|science and religion]] were one.&lt;ref&gt;"He considered that scientific research must result in deeper awareness of religious truth, whilst the pursuit of religious truth can only be undertaken in the open minded spirit of scientific enquiry." From {{cite book | last = Thorncroft | first = Michael | title = Trust in Freedom: The Story of Newington Green Unitarian Church 1708 – 1958 | publisher = Private publication for the trustees of the church | year = 1958 | location = London | pages = 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Varleys he attended a [[Sandemanian]] church, where he became acquainted with [[Michael Faraday]].&lt;ref&gt;ONDB entry&lt;/ref&gt; In the end he joined a Unitarian congregation, because religious freedom and self-improvement were the watchwords of [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches|the movement]], which still struggled against [[civil disabilities]]. Money aside, Pritchard would not have been able to attend an English university as a young man, for example, because the only two, Oxford and Cambridge, restricted entry to members of the [[Church of England]]. "No-one exists divorced from immediate and larger social environments. Dissenters led educational reform, especially in giving "lower orders" scientific knowledge and skill."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag//artsep10/pp-cvsmith.html "CHARLES HENRY VANCE SMITH – MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE"] by Peter B. Paisley in ''Microscopy Magazine", September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pritchard joined the congregation of [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]], an establishment long connected with scientific enquiry ([[Joseph Priestley]]), education ([[Mary Wollstonecraft]]), and political dissent ([[Richard Price]]). He is described in the church's history as "the leading member of the congregation". From 1850 to 1873 he was its treasurer, during which time donations doubled. Before the passage of the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]], [[Compulsory education|compulsory schooling]] did not exist, so the church started a school to offer education to the village children. He led the Newington Green Conversation Society, membership restricted to 16, a successor to the Mutual Instruction Society.&lt;ref&gt;p23-24. {{cite book | last = Thorncroft | first = Michael | title = Trust in Freedom: The Story of Newington Green Unitarian Church 1708 – 1958 | publisher = Private publication for the trustees of the church | year = 1958 | location = London | pages = 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faraday was a frequent visitor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag//artsep10/pp-cvsmith.html "CHARLES HENRY VANCE SMITH – MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE"] by Peter B. Paisley in ''Microscopy Magazine'', September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Pritchard died in [[Highbury]] in London on 24 November 1882.

==Family==
He married Caroline Isabella Straker in 1829 and they had several children. His wife was chair of the chapel organisation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag//artsep10/pp-cvsmith.html "CHARLES HENRY VANCE SMITH – MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE"] by Peter B. Paisley in ''Microscopy Magazine", September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and after a few decades there were 20 Pritchards involved in the chapel.&lt;ref&gt;chapter 7 {{cite book | last = Thorncroft | first = Michael | title = Trust in Freedom: The Story of Newington Green Unitarian Church 1708 – 1958 | publisher = Private publication for the trustees of the church | year = 1958 | location = London | pages = 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their son Henry Baden Pritchard (1841–1884) was a chemist, traveller, and photographer. Their son Andrew Goring Pritchard, a solicitor, was a leading light of the [[Municipal borough#Municipal Corporations Act 1835|Association of Municipal Corporations]]; his son, Clive Fleetwood Pritchard, a barrister, became mayor of [[Hampstead]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.uea.ac.uk/lib/libinf/find/archives/pritchard/pp1ch.htm List of library archives]&lt;/ref&gt; ''his'' son [[Jack Pritchard]] (1899-1992) co-founded the [[Isokon]] design company, famous for the [[Lawn Road Flats]].

Andrew and Caroline's son, Ion (died 1929) and daughter Marian (died 1908), continued the work of their parents at the Newington Green Unitarian Church.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the [[Essex Hall]] [https://archive.org/stream/essexhallyearbo00assogoog/essexhallyearbo00assogoog_djvu.txt ''Yearbook'' of 1903]&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of [[liberal religion]] in general, and the development of the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches]], were overarching themes. Ion was President of the Sunday School Association,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924029357062/cu31924029357062_djvu.txt RELIGION AND LIBERTY.

HUGENHOLTZ Jr. Leyden, 1904]&lt;/ref&gt; one of the precursors to the General Assembly. Marian in particular is described as an unsung heroine, and "one of the leaders of modern Unitarianism". She set up Oxford Summer Schools for the training of Sunday School teachers, and Winifred House Invalid Children's Convalescent Home.&lt;ref&gt;Thorncroft, p28, and throughout ch7 "The Lights Go Out".&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1238">An '''audio converter''' is a device or software that converts an [[audio signal]] from one format to another.

Hardware audio converters include [[analog to digital converter]]s (ADCs), which convert [[Analog signal|analog]] audio to uncompressed digital form (e.g., [[PCM]]), and their reciprocal partners, [[digital to analog converter]]s (DACs), which convert uncompressed digital audio to analog form. ADCs and DACs are usually components of hardware products. For example, [[sound card]]s and [[capture card]]s both include ADCs to allow a computer to record audio. Sound cards also feature DACs for audio playback.

Some audio conversion functions can be performed by software or by specialized hardware. For example, an audio [[transcoder]] converts from one [[compressed audio format]] to another (e.g., [[MP3]] to [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]]) by means of two [[audio codecs]]: One for decoding (uncompressing) the source and one for encoding (compressing) the destination file or stream.

[[File:Dupuis, Pierre - Basket of Plums.jpg|thumb|240px|''Basket of Plums'', painting by [[Pierre Dupuis]].]]

A '''basket''' is a container which is traditionally constructed from stiff fibers, which can be made from a range of materials, including wood splints, runners, and cane. While most baskets are made from plant materials, other materials such as horsehair, [[baleen]], or metal wire can be used. Baskets are generally woven by hand.  Some baskets are fitted with a lid, others are left open.

==Uses==
[[File:Baskets in Haikou 03.jpg|thumb|right|250px|On the left side are live fowl baskets. Directly to the right are flat baskets used for selling shrimp and small fish in [[Haikou]] City, [[Hainan]] Province, [[People's Republic of China]]]]
Baskets serve utilitarian as well as aesthetic purposes. Some baskets are ceremonial, that is religious, in nature.&lt;ref name=hopi&gt;[http://nanact.org/encounter-the-people/hopi/hopi-basketry.html "Hopi Basketry."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224000204/http://nanact.org/encounter-the-people/hopi/hopi-basketry.html |date=2012-02-24 }} ''Northern Arizona Native American Culture Trail.'' (retrieved 13 Nov 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; While baskets are typically used for storage and transport, specialized baskets are as [[sieve]]s, for cooking, for processing seeds or grains, for tossing gambling pieces, rattles, fans, [[fish trap]]s, [[laundry]], and other uses.

==History==

Prior to the invention of woven baskets, people used tree bark to make simple containers. These containers could be used to transport gathered food and other items, but crumble after only a few uses. Weaving strips of bark or other plant material to support the bark containers would be the next step, followed by entirely woven baskets. The last innovation appears to be baskets so tightly woven that they could hold water.

Depending on soil conditions, baskets may or may not be preserved in the archaeological record. Sites in the [[Middle East]] show that weaving techniques were used to make mats and possibly also baskets, circa [[9th millennium BC|8000 BCE]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Twined baskets date back to 7000 BCE in [[Oasisamerica]].&lt;ref name=hopi/&gt; Baskets made with interwoven techniques were common at [[4th millennium BC|3000 BCE]].

Baskets were originally designed as multi-purpose baskets to carry and store  and to keep stray items about the home. The plant life available in a region affects the choice of material, which in turn influences the weaving technique. [[Rattan]] and other members of the [[Arecaceae]] or [[palm tree]] family, the thin grasses of temperate regions, and broad-leaved tropical [[bromeliad]]s each require a different method of twisting and braiding to be made into a basket. The practice of basket making has evolved into an [[art]]. Artistic freedom allows basket makers a wide choice of colors, materials, sizes, patterns, and details.

The carrying of a [[Head-carrying|basket on the head]], particularly by rural women, has long been practised. Representations of this in [[Ancient Greek art]] are called [[Canephorae]].

==Figurative and literary usage==
The phrase "[[to hell in a handbasket]]" means ''to rapidly deteriorate''. The origin of this use is unclear.
"Basket" is sometimes used as an adjective towards a person who is born out of wedlock.&lt;ref name="oed.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/15969|title=basket, n.|work=oed.com|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs more commonly in British English.  "Basket" also refers to a bulge in a man's crotch.&lt;ref name="oed.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2777">'''BelMal''' is a private museum located in [[Belgium]], with twin locations in the [[Durbuy]] and [[Manhay]] municipalities of the [[Luxembourg (province of Belgium)|province of Luxembourg]].

The museum comprises antique travelling trunks and related baggage and travel equipment from around the globe, and the world's most important collection of trunks made by Belgian trunk-makers of the 19th century. 

The BelMal Archives include the lists (registries) of the names and brands of trunk makers ([[malletier]]) that were active in Europe and around the globe. There is a separate registry of Belgian trunk makers and manufacturers of travel objects.

In the restoration workshop, led by a person of authority in the field of travel trunks restoration and history, travel trunks are restored for the collection and for third parties. In the same workshop new trunks are made to order; some of the specially commissioned ones carry the BelMal Malletier brand name.

Courses in the restoration and in the manufacture of trunks, and in the travel equipment history, are part of the educational activity of the affiliate Ecole des Malletiers (formerly called BelMal Conservatory) tribute to 16th century trunk-makers Nicolas Gilbert of Belgium and Jean Paré of France.

{{Renewable energy sources}}
{{Sustainable energy}}

A '''biofuel''' is a [[fuel]] that is produced through contemporary biological processes, such as agriculture and [[anaerobic digestion]], rather than a fuel produced by geological processes such as those involved in the formation of [[fossil fuel]]s, such as coal and petroleum, from prehistoric biological matter.

Biofuels can be derived directly from plants (i.e. [[energy crop]]s), or indirectly from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/biofuel.html|title=What is biofuel? definition and meaning|work=BusinessDictionary.com|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary [[carbon fixation]], such as those that occur in [[plants]] or [[microalgae]] through the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Other renewable biofuels are made through the use or conversion of [[biomass]]  (referring to recently living organisms, most often referring to [[plants]] or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy-containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in [[solid]], [[liquid]], or [[gas]] form. This new biomass can also be used directly for biofuels.

Biofuels are in theory [[Carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] because the carbon dioxide that is absorbed by the plants is equal to the carbon dioxide that is released when the fuel is burned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/print.php?page=biomass_environment Biomass and the Environment – Basics]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice, whether or not a biofuel is carbon-neutral also depends greatly on whether the land which is used to grow the biofuel (with 1st and 2nd generation biofuel) [[Land use, land-use change, and forestry|needed to be cleared of carbon-holding vegetation]] or not.

[[Ethanol#Fuel|Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]], [[sugarcane]], or [[sweet sorghum]]. [[Cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form (E100), but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Biofuel in the United States|United States]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]]. Current plant design does not provide for converting the [[lignin]] portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation.

[[Biodiesel]] can be used as a [[fuel]] for vehicles in its pure form (B100), but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe.

In 2010, worldwide biofuel production reached 105 billion liters (28 billion gallons US), up 17% from 2009,&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/biofuels-make-comeback-despite-tough-economy|title=Biofuels Make a Comeback Despite Tough Economy|publisher=[[Worldwatch Institute]]|date=2011-08-31|accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's fuels for road transport. Global [[ethanol fuel]] production reached 86 billion liters (23 billion gallons US) in 2010, with the United States and Brazil as the world's top producers, accounting together for about 90% of global production. The world's largest biodiesel producer is the [[European Union]], accounting for 53% of all biodiesel production in 2010.&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010/&gt; {{as of|2011}}, mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 states or provinces.&lt;ref name=ren212011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905003859/http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-05 |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |pages=13–14 |access-date=2015-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Energy Agency]] has a goal for biofuels to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050 to reduce dependence on petroleum and coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/biofuels_roadmap.pdf |year= 2011 |title=Technology Roadmap, Biofuels for Transport }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of biofuels also led into a flourishing automotive industry, where by 2010, 79% of all cars produced in Brazil were made with a hybrid fuel system of bioethanol and gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hall | first1 = Jeremy | last2 = Matos | first2 = Stelvia | last3 = Silvestre | first3 = Bruno | last4 = Martin | first4 = Michael | year = 2011 | title = Managing Technological and Social Uncertainties of Innovation: The Evolution of Brazilian Energy and Agriculture | url = | journal = Technological Forecasting and Social Change | volume = 78 | issue = 7| pages = 1147–1157 | doi = 10.1016/j.techfore.2011.02.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various social, economic, environmental and technical [[issues relating to biofuels]] production and use, which have been debated in the popular media and scientific journals.

==Generations==
===First-generation biofuels===
"First-generation" or conventional biofuels are biofuels made from food crops grown on arable land. With this biofuel production generation, food crops are thus [[Food vs fuel|explicitly grown for fuel production]], and not anything else. The sugar, starch, or vegetable oil obtained from the crops is converted into biodiesel or ethanol, using [[transesterification]], or yeast fermentation.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100521143237/http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2010/05/18/3g-4g-a-taxonomy-for-far-out-%E2%80%94-but-not-far-away-%E2%80%94-biofuels/ First, second, third and fourth generation biofuels explained]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second-generation biofuels===
{{Main|Second-generation biofuels}}
Second generation biofuels are fuels manufactured from various types of [[biomass]].  Biomass is a wide-ranging term meaning any source of organic carbon that is renewed rapidly as part of the [[carbon cycle]]. Biomass is derived from plant materials, but can also include animal materials.

Whereas first generation biofuels are made from the [[sugar]]s and [[vegetable oil]]s found in arable crops, second generation biofuels are made from [[lignocellulosic biomass]] or woody crops, agricultural residues or waste plant material (from food crops that have already fulfilled their food purpose).&lt;ref&gt;An example here is [[rapeseed]], of which the oil is used as waste fuel, and of which the actual produce (for which the crop is grown) is [[fodder]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Coconut oil]] is another example, if it is extracted in such a way that the meat and milk can still be used for human and/or animal consumption.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2010/12/24/barley-grain-can-be-used-to-produce-ethanol-says-scientists-with-usda/{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.315.5818.1488 |pmid=17363642 |title=CELLULOSIC ETHANOL: Biofuel Researchers Prepare to Reap a New Harvest |journal=Science |volume=315 |issue=5818 |pages=1488–1491 |year=2007 |last1=Service |first1=R. F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jksus.2017.07.005 |title=Bioconversion of corn straw to ethanol by cellulolytic yeasts immobilized in Mucuna urens matrix |journal=Journal of King Saud University - Science |year=2017 |last1=Adelabu |first1=Blessing Adebola |last2=Kareem |first2=Sarafadeen Olateju |last3=Oluwafemi |first3=Flora |last4=Abideen Adeogun |first4=Idowu }}&lt;/ref&gt; The feedstock used to generate second-generation biofuels thus either grows on [[arable land]]s, but are just byproducts of the actual harvest (main crop) or they are grown on lands which cannot be used to effectively grow food crops&lt;ref&gt;i.e. arid lands in case of jatropha, or hilly terrain not accessible by tractor, ... in case of grasses, woody crops ...&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases neither extra water or fertilizer is applied to them. Non-human food second generation feedstock sources include grasses, jatropha and other seed crops, waste vegetable oil, municipal solid waste and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biofuel.org.uk/second-generation-biofuels.html|title=Biofuels - Second Generation Biofuels|website=biofuel.org.uk|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that, unlike with regular food crops, no arable land is used solely for the production of fuel. The disadvantage is that unlike with regular food crops, it may be rather difficult to extract the fuel. For instance, a series of physical and chemical treatments might be required to convert lignocellulosic biomass to liquid fuels suitable for transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3390/en8076765 |title=A Review of Hydrothermal Liquefaction Bio-Crude Properties and Prospects for Upgrading to Transportation Fuels |journal=Energies |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=6765–6794 |year=2015 |last1=Ramirez |first1=Jerome |last2=Brown |first2=Richard |last3=Rainey |first3=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The potential and challenges of drop-in fuels (members only) {{!}} IEA Bioenergy Task 39 – Commercializing Liquid Biofuels|url = http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/?p=932|website = task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca|accessdate = 2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third-generation biofuels===
{{Main|Algaculture|Algae fuel}}
From 1978 to 1996, the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory|US NREL]] experimented with using algae as a biofuels source in the "[[Aquatic Species Program]]".&lt;ref name = "NREL biofuels algae"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheehan|first=John|title=A Look Back at the U. S. Department of Energy's Aquatic Species Program: Biofuels from Algae|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy98/24190.pdf|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=16 June 2012|date=July 1998|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A self-published article by Michael Briggs, at the [[University of New Hampshire|UNH]] Biofuels Group, offers estimates for the realistic replacement of all [[motor vehicle|vehicular]] fuel with biofuels by using algae that have a natural oil content greater than 50%, which Briggs suggests can be grown on algae ponds at [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] plants.&lt;ref name="Briggs2004"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.unh.edu/p2/biodiesel/article_alge.html| title = Widescale Biodiesel Production from Algae| first = Michael |last=Briggs|date=August 2004| accessdate = 2007-01-02

The production of algae to harvest oil for biofuels has not yet been undertaken on a commercial scale, but [[feasibility study|feasibility studies]] have been conducted to arrive at the above yield estimate. In addition to its projected high yield, algaculture&amp;nbsp;– unlike [[agriculture|crop-based]] biofuels&amp;nbsp;– does not entail a decrease in [[food production]], since it requires neither [[farmland (farming)|farmland]] nor [[fresh water]]. Many companies are pursuing algae bioreactors for various purposes, including scaling up biofuels production to commercial levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valcent.net/t/news_detailf62c.html?id=36 |title=Valcent Products Inc.

Teixeira]] from the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] demonstrated the extraction of biofuels lipids from wet algae using a simple and economical reaction in [[ionic liquids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Energy-efficient extraction of fuel and chemical feedstocks from algae |journal = [[Green Chemistry (journal)|Green Chemistry]] | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | year = 2012 | pages = 419–427 | author = R. E. Teixeira | doi = 10.1039/C2GC16225C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth-generation biofuels===
Similarly to third-generation biofuels, fourth-generation biofuels are made using non-arable land. However, unlike third-generation biofuels, they do not require the destruction of biomass. This class of biofuels includes [[electrofuel]]s&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; and [[Solar fuel|photobiological solar fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=4678123 | pmid=26667057 | doi=10.1007/s13280-015-0730-0 | volume=45 Suppl 1 | title=From first generation biofuels to advanced solar biofuels | journal=Ambio | pages=S24–31 | last1 = Aro | first1 = EM| year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these fuels are [[Carbon-neutral fuel#Production|carbon-neutral]].

==Types==
The following fuels can be produced using first, second, third or fourth-generation biofuel production procedures. Most of these can even be produced using two or three of the different biofuel generation procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Ethanol for instance can be produced using 1G, 2G and 3G procedures&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biogas===

[[File:Biogas pipes.JPG|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Pipes carrying biogas]]
{{Main|Biogas}}
Biogas is [[methane]] produced by the process of [[anaerobic digestion]] of [[organic material]] by [[anaerobe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Redman, G., The Andersons Centre. [https://web.archive.org/web/20081004232058/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/metadot/index.pl?id=7198%3Bisa%3DDBRow%3Bop%3Dshow%3Bdbview_id%3D2457 "Assessment of on-farm AD in the UK"], ''[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]'', 2008-06-09. Retrieved on 2009-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be produced either from [[biodegradable waste]] materials or by the use of [[energy crop]]s fed into [[anaerobic digester]]s to supplement gas yields. The solid byproduct, [[digestate]], can be used as a biofuel or a fertilizer.

Biogas can be recovered from [[mechanical biological treatment]] waste processing systems. [[Landfill gas]], a less clean form of biogas, is produced in [[landfill]]s through naturally occurring anaerobic digestion. If it escapes into the atmosphere, it is a potential [[greenhouse gas]].

Farmers can produce biogas from [[manure]] from their cattle by using anaerobic digesters.&lt;ref&gt;"BIOGAS: No bull, manure can power your farm." Farmers Guardian (25 September 2009): 12. General OneFile. Gale.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syngas===

{{Main|Gasification}}
[[Syngas]], a mixture of [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen]] and other hydrocarbons, is produced by partial combustion of biomass, that is, combustion with an amount of [[oxygen]] that is not sufficient to convert the biomass completely to carbon dioxide and water.&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt; Before partial combustion, the biomass is dried, and sometimes [[pyrolysis|pyrolysed]]. The resulting gas mixture, syngas, is more efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel; more of the energy contained in the fuel is extracted.

Syngas may be burned directly in internal combustion engines, [[turbines]] or high-temperature fuel cells.&lt;ref name="e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch"&gt;[http://e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch/view/eth:41553 Electricity from wood through the combination of gasification and solid oxide fuel cells], Ph.D. Thesis by Florian Nagel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wood gas generator]], a wood-fueled gasification reactor, can be connected to an internal combustion engine.

Syngas can be used to produce [[methanol]], [[Dimethyl ether|DME]] and [[hydrogen]], or converted via the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] to produce a diesel substitute, or a mixture of alcohols that can be blended into gasoline. Gasification normally relies on temperatures greater than 700&amp;nbsp;°C.

Lower-temperature gasification is desirable when co-producing [[biochar]], but results in syngas polluted with [[tar]].

===Ethanol===

{{Main|Ethanol fuel}}
[[File:Sao Paulo ethanol pump 04 2008 74 zoom.jpg|thumb|left|[[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E100|Neat ethanol]] on the left&amp;nbsp;(A), [[gasoline]] on the right (G) at a [[filling station]] in [[Brazil]]]]
Biologically produced [[alcohols]], most commonly [[ethanol]], and less commonly [[Propan-1-ol|propanol]] and [[butanol fuel|butanol]], are produced by the action of [[microorganism]]s and [[enzyme]]s through the fermentation of sugars or starches (easiest), or cellulose (which is more difficult). [[Biobutanol]] (also called biogasoline) is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for gasoline, because it can be used directly in a gasoline engine.

[[File:Bushlulacana09032007.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] looks at sugar cane, a source of biofuel, with Brazilian President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] during a tour on biofuel technology at [[Petrobras]] in [[São Paulo]], Brazil, 9 March 2007.]]
[[Ethanol fuel]] is the most common biofuel worldwide, particularly [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|in Brazil]]. [[Alcohol fuel]]s are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from [[wheat]], [[Maize|corn]], [[sugar beet]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[molasses]] and any sugar or starch from which [[alcoholic beverage]]s such as [[whiskey]], can be made (such as [[potato]] and [[fruit]] waste, etc.). The ethanol production methods used are [[digestive enzyme|enzyme digestion]] (to release sugars from stored starches), fermentation of the sugars, [[distillation]] and drying. The distillation process requires significant energy input for heat (sometimes unsustainable [[natural gas]] fossil fuel, but cellulosic biomass such as [[bagasse]], the waste left after sugar cane is pressed to extract its juice, is the most common fuel in Brazil, while pellets, wood chips and also [[waste heat]] are more common in Europe) Waste steam fuels ethanol factory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eon.se/om-eon/Om-energi/Produktion-av-el-gas-varme-och-kyla/Kraftvarme/Vara-kraftvarmeverk/Handeloverket/Handeloverket-Panna-15/Energikombinatet_bild/ Energikunskap | Lär dig mer om energi - E.ON&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; – where waste heat from the factories also is used in the district heating grid.

Ethanol can be used in petrol engines as a replacement for gasoline; it can be mixed with gasoline to any percentage. Most existing car petrol engines can run on blends of up to 15% bioethanol with petroleum/gasoline. Ethanol has a smaller [[energy density]] than that of gasoline; this means it takes more fuel (volume and mass) to produce the same amount of work. An advantage of ethanol ({{chem|CH|3|CH|2|OH}}) is that it has a higher [[octane rating]] than ethanol-free gasoline available at roadside gas stations, which allows an increase of an engine's [[compression ratio]] for increased [[thermal efficiency]]. In high-altitude (thin air) locations, some states mandate a mix of gasoline and ethanol as a winter [[oxidizer]] to reduce atmospheric pollution emissions.

Ethanol is also used to fuel bioethanol [[fireplaces]]. As they do not require a chimney and are "flueless", bioethanol fires&lt;ref&gt;Bio ethanol fires information [http://www.prestigiousfires.co.uk/ bio ethanol fireplace]. (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; are extremely useful for newly built homes and apartments without a flue.
The downsides to these fireplaces is that their heat output is slightly less than electric heat or gas fires, and precautions must be taken to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.

Corn-to-ethanol and other food stocks has led to the development of [[cellulosic ethanol]]. According to a joint research agenda conducted through the US Department of Energy,&lt;ref&gt;see "Breaking the Biological Barriers to Cellulosic Ethanol"&lt;/ref&gt; the fossil energy ratios ([[Fossil Energy Ratio|FER]]) for cellulosic ethanol, corn ethanol, and gasoline are 10.3, 1.36, and 0.81, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkman, N. et al., "Well-to-Wheels Analysis of Advanced/Vehicle Systems", 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farrell | first1 = A.E. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol can Contribute to Energy and Environmental Goals | url = | journal = Science | volume = 311 | issue = 5760| pages = 506–8 | doi=10.1126/science.1121416 | pmid=16439656}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hammerschlag | first1 = R | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol's Energy Return on Investment: A Survey of the Literature 1999-Present | url = | journal = Environ. Sci. Technol. | volume = 40 | issue = 6| pages = 1744–50 | doi=10.1021/es052024h| pmid = 16570592 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethanol has roughly one-third lower energy content per unit of volume compared to gasoline. This is partly counteracted by the better efficiency when using ethanol (in a long-term test of more than 2.1 million km, the BEST project found FFV vehicles to be 1–26% more energy efficient than petrol cars, but the volumetric consumption increases by approximately 30%, so more fuel stops are required).

With current subsidies, ethanol fuel is slightly cheaper per distance traveled in the United States.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Other bioalcohols===

[[Methanol]] is currently produced from [[natural gas]], a [[non-renewable]] fossil fuel. In the future it is hoped to be produced from biomass as [[biomethanol]]. This is technically feasible, but the production is currently being postponed for concerns of [[Jacob S. Gibbs]] and [[Brinsley Coleberd]] that the economic viability is still pending.&lt;ref&gt;Börjesson.P. et al. 2013, REPORT f3 2013:13, p 170&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[methanol economy]] is an alternative to the [[hydrogen economy]], compared to today's [[hydrogen]] production from natural gas.

[[Butanol fuel|Butanol]] ({{chem|C|4|H|9|OH}}) is formed by [[Clostridium acetobutylicum|ABE fermentation]] (acetone, butanol, ethanol) and experimental modifications of the process show potentially high [[net energy gain]]s with butanol as the only liquid product. Butanol will produce more energy and allegedly can be burned "straight" in existing gasoline engines (without modification to the engine or car),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.butanol.com/ |title=ButylFuel, LLC Main Page |publisher=Butanol.com |date=2005-08-15 |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is less corrosive and less water-soluble than ethanol, and could be distributed via existing infrastructures. [[DuPont]] and [[BP]] are working together to help develop butanol. ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' strains have also been successfully engineered to produce butanol by modifying their [[protein metabolism|amino acid metabolism]].&lt;ref name="butanol"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biofpr.com/details/feature/102347/Biofuels_aim_higher.html|title=Biofuels aim higher|last=Evans|first=Jon|date=14 January 2008 |work=Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining (BioFPR)|accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One drawback to butanol production in E. coli remains the high cost of nutrient rich media, however, recent work has demonstrated E. coli can produce butanol with minimal nutritional supplementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2018.08.004 |pmid=30107263 |title=Directed strain evolution restructures metabolism for 1-butanol production in minimal media |journal=Metabolic Engineering |volume=49 |pages=153–163 |year=2018 |last1=Pontrelli |first1=Sammy |last2=Fricke |first2=Riley C.B. |last3=Sakurai |first3=Sana Subhan Memon |last4=Putri |first4=Sastia Prama |last5=Fitz-Gibbon |first5=Sorel |last6=Chung |first6=Matthew |last7=Wu |first7=Hsin-Yi |last8=Chen |first8=Yu-Ju |last9=Pellegrini |first9=Matteo |last10=Fukusaki |first10=Eiichiro |last11=Liao |first11=James C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biodiesel ===

{{Main|Biodiesel}}
{{Further|Biodiesel around the world}}
[[Biodiesel]] is the most common biofuel in Europe. It is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil/mineral diesel. Chemically, it consists mostly of fatty acid methyl (or ethyl) esters ([[Fatty acid methyl ester|FAMEs]]). Feedstocks for biodiesel include animal fats, vegetable oils, [[soy]], [[rapeseed]], [[Jatropha curcas|jatropha]], [[Madhuca longifolia|mahua]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], [[flax]], [[sunflower]], [[palm oil]], [[hemp]], [[thlaspi arvense|field pennycress]], ''[[Pongamia pinnata]]'' and [[algae fuel|algae]]. Pure biodiesel (B100, also known as "neat" biodiesel) currently reduces emissions with up to 60% compared to diesel Second generation B100.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perstorp.com/en/Media/Pressreleases/2013/20130701_Verdis_Polaris_Aura_second_generation_B100/ Perstop Press release: Verdis Polaris Aura – second generation B100 – The advanced green one]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Targray Biodiesel Railcar.png|thumb|Targray Biofuels Division railcar transporting Biodiesel.]]Biodiesel can be used in any [[diesel engine]] when mixed with mineral diesel. It can also be used in its pure form (B100) in diesel engines, but some maintenance and performance problems may then occur during wintertime utilization, since the fuel becomes somewhat more [[viscosity|viscous]] at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inforse.org/europe/dieret/altfuels/biodiesel.htm BIODIESEL]&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, manufacturers cover their diesel engines under warranty for B100 use, although [[Volkswagen]] of [[Germany]], for example, asks drivers to check by telephone with the VW environmental services department before switching to B100&lt;!-- (see [[Biodiesel#Use|biodiesel use]]) --&gt;. In most cases, biodiesel is compatible with diesel engines from 1994 onwards, which use '[[Viton]]' (by [[DuPont]]) [[synthetic rubber]] in their mechanical [[fuel injection]] systems. Note however, that no vehicles are certified for using pure biodiesel before 2014, as there was no emission control protocol available for biodiesel before this date.

Electronically controlled '[[common rail]]' and '[[Unit Injector|unit injector]]' type systems from the late 1990s onwards may only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel. These engines have finely metered and atomized multiple-stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel. Many current-generation diesel engines are made so that they can run on B100 without altering the engine itself, although this depends on the [[fuel rail]] design.
Since biodiesel is an effective [[solvent]] and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel, [[oil filter|engine filters]] may need to be replaced more often, as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes. It also effectively cleans the engine [[combustion chamber]] of carbon deposits, helping to maintain efficiency. In many European countries, a 5% biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiesel.de/ |title=ADM Biodiesel: Hamburg, Leer, Mainz |publisher=Biodiesel.de |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RRI Limited for Biodiesel Filling Stations |url=http://www.biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |title=Welcome to Biodiesel Filling Stations |publisher=Biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biodiesel is also an [[oxygenated diesel|oxygenated fuel]], meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel. This improves the [[combustion]] of biodiesel and reduces the particulate emissions from unburnt carbon. However, using pure biodiesel may increase NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-emissions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vtt.fi/inf/pdf/technology/2012/T46.pdf Nylund.N-O &amp; Koponen.K. 2013.

Possibly the new emission standards Euro VI/EPA 10 will lead to reduced NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-levels also when using B100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiesel is also safe to handle and transport because it is non-toxic and [[biodegradable]], and has a high [[flash point]] of about 300&amp;nbsp;°F (148&amp;nbsp;°C) compared to petroleum diesel fuel, which has a flash point of 125&amp;nbsp;°F (52&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hempcar.org/biofacts.shtml |title=Biofuels Facts |publisher=Hempcar.org |accessdate=2010-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520231032/http://hempcar.org/biofacts.shtml |archivedate=20 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, more than 80% of commercial trucks and city buses run on diesel. The emerging US biodiesel market is estimated to have grown 200% from 2004 to 2005.

===Straight vegetable oil===

[[File:Used vegetable cooking oil.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Filtered waste vegetable oil]]

{{Main|Vegetable oil fuel}}
Straight unmodified [[Eating|edible]] vegetable oil is generally not used as fuel, but lower-quality oil has been used for this purpose. Used vegetable oil is increasingly being processed into biodiesel, or (more rarely) cleaned of water and particulates and then used as a fuel.

As with 100% biodiesel (B100), to ensure the [[fuel injector]]s atomize the vegetable oil in the correct pattern for efficient combustion, [[vegetable oil fuel]] must be heated to reduce its [[viscosity]] to that of diesel, either by electric coils or heat exchangers. This is easier in warm or temperate climates. [[MAN B&amp;W Diesel]], [[Wärtsilä]], and [[Deutz AG]], as well as a number of smaller companies, such as [[Elsbett]], offer engines that are compatible with straight vegetable oil, without the need for after-market modifications.

Vegetable oil can also be used in many older diesel engines that do not use [[common rail]] or [[Unit Injector|unit injection]] electronic diesel injection systems. Due to the design of the combustion chambers in [[indirect injection]] engines, these are the best engines for use with vegetable oil. This system allows the relatively larger oil molecules more time to burn. Some older engines, especially Mercedes, are driven experimentally by enthusiasts without any conversion, a handful of drivers have experienced limited success with earlier pre-"Pumpe Duse" [[VW TDI]] engines and other similar engines with [[Direct fuel injection|direct injection]]. Several companies, such as [[Elsbett]] or Wolf, have developed professional conversion kits and successfully installed hundreds of them over the last decades.

Oils and fats can be [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] to give a diesel substitute. The resulting product is a straight-chain hydrocarbon with a high [[cetane number]], low in [[aromatics]] and [[sulfur]] and does not contain oxygen. [[Hydrogenated oil]]s can be blended with diesel in all proportions. They have several advantages over biodiesel, including good performance at low temperatures, no storage stability problems and no susceptibility to microbial attack.&lt;ref name=evans&gt;Evans, G.

===Bioethers===

Bioethers (also referred to as fuel [[ethers]] or [[oxygenated fuel]]s) are cost-effective [[Chemical compound|compounds]] that act as [[octane rating]] enhancers."Bioethers are produced by the reaction of reactive iso-olefins, such as iso-butylene, with bioethanol."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rock|first=Kerry|title=Bioethers Impact on the Gasoline Pool|url=http://www.digitalrefining.com/article/1000210,Bioethers_impact_on_the_gasoline_pool.html|publisher=Digital Refining|accessdate=15 February 2014|author2=Maurice Korpelshoek|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioethers are created by wheat or sugar beet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biofuel.org.uk/bioethers.html Biofuels - Types of Biofuels - Bioethers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  They also enhance [[engine]] performance, while significantly reducing engine wear and [[toxic]] [[exhaust gas|exhaust emissions]]. Although bioethers are likely to replace petroethers in the UK, it is highly unlikely they will become a fuel in and of itself due to the low energy density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biofuel.org.uk/bioethers.html|title=Biofuels - Types of Biofuels - Bioethers|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Greatly reducing the amount of ground-level [[ozone emissions]], they contribute to air quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31985L0536:EN:HTML |title=Council Directive 85/536/EEC of 5 December 1985 on crude-oil savings through the use of substitute fuel components in petrol |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/registre/docs_autres_institutions/commission_europeenne/sec/2007/0055/COM_SEC(2007)0055_EN.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - IA 55 EN.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it comes to transportation fuel there are six ether additives: [[dimethyl ether]] (DME), [[diethyl ether]] (DEE), methyl teritiary-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl ''ter''-butyl ether (ETBE), t''er''-amyl methyl ether (TAME), and ''ter''-amyl ethyl ether (TAEE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sukla |first=Mirtunjay Kumar |title=Bio-Ethers as Transportation Fuel: A Review |url=http://www.ascension-publishing.com/BIZ/DMEoverview.pdf |publisher=Indian Institute of Petroleum Dehradun |accessdate=15 February 2014 |author2=Thallada Bhaskar |author3=A.K.

The European Fuel Oxygenates Association (EFOA) credits methyl Ttertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl ter-butyl ether (ETBE) as the most commonly used ethers in fuel to replace lead. Ethers were introduced in Europe in the 1970s to replace the highly toxic compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are Bio-Ethers? |url=http://www.petrochemistry.eu/ftp/pressroom/EFOA_2008_def.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306082952/http://www.petrochemistry.eu/ftp/pressroom/EFOA_2008_def.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-06 |publisher=.

===Solid biomass fuels ===

Examples include [[wood]], [[sawdust]], [[grass]] trimmings, [[domestic waste|domestic refuse]], [[charcoal]], [[agricultural waste]], nonfood [[energy crop]]s, and [[Dry animal dung fuel|dried manure]].

When solid biomass is already in a suitable form (such as [[firewood]]), it can burn directly in a stove or furnace to provide heat or raise steam. When solid biomass is in an inconvenient form (such as sawdust, wood chips, grass, urban waste wood, agricultural residues), the typical process is to densify the biomass. This process includes grinding the raw biomass to an appropriate particulate size (known as hogfuel), which, depending on the densification type, can be from {{convert|1|to|3|cm|1|abbr=on}}, which is then concentrated into a fuel product. The current processes produce [[wood pellet]]s, cubes, or pucks. The pellet process is most common in Europe, and is typically a pure wood product. The other types of densification are larger in size compared to a pellet and are compatible with a broad range of input feedstocks. The resulting densified fuel is easier to transport and feed into thermal generation systems, such as boilers.

Sawdust, bark and chips are already used for decades for fuel in industrial processes; examples include the pulp and paper industry and the sugar cane industry. Boilers in the range of 500,000&amp;nbsp;lb/hr of steam, and larger, are in routine operation, using grate, spreader stoker, suspension burning and fluid bed combustion. Utilities generate power, typically in the range of 5 to 50 MW, using locally available fuel. Other industries have also installed wood waste fueled boilers and dryers in areas with low-cost fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. McGowan, Michael L. Brown, William S. Bulpitt, James L. Walsh, Jr. (Editors) 2009. Biomass and Alternate Fuel Systems: An Engineering and Economic Guide. {{ISBN|978-0-470-41028-8}} Wiley, 280 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the advantages of solid biomass fuel is that it is often a byproduct, residue or waste-product of other processes, such as farming, animal husbandry and forestry.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Frauke Urban and Tom Mitchell 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation Climate change, disasters and electricity generation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920024704/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation |date=20 September 2012 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]] and [[Institute of Development Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, this means fuel and food production do not compete for resources, although this is not always the case.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

A problem with the combustion of solid biomass fuels is that it emits considerable amounts of [[pollutant]]s, such as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]]. Even modern pellet boilers generate much more pollutants than oil or natural gas boilers. Pellets made from agricultural residues are usually worse than wood pellets, producing much larger emissions of [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] and [[chlorophenol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Briens | first1 = Cedric | last2 = Piskorz | first2 = Jan | last3 = Berruti | first3 = Franco | year = 2008 | title = Biomass Valorization for Fuel and Chemicals Production -- A Review | url = | journal = International Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering | volume = 6 | issue = | page = R2 | doi=10.2202/1542-6580.1674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A derived fuel is [[biochar]], which is produced by biomass [[pyrolysis]]. Biochar made from agricultural waste can substitute for wood charcoal. As wood stock becomes scarce, this alternative is gaining ground. In eastern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], for example, [[biomass briquettes]] are being marketed as an alternative to charcoal to protect [[Virunga National Park]] from [[deforestation]] associated with [[charcoal]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/env-english/2008/July/20080711150646mlenuhret0.9135401.html |title=Threat to Great Apes Highlighted at Virunga Meeting |publisher=America.gov |accessdate=2010-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828133830/http://www.america.gov/st/env-english/2008/July/20080711150646mlenuhret0.9135401.html |archivedate=28 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air pollution==
{{main|Biomass#Environmental damage|Ethanol_fuel#Air_pollution}}

Biofuels are similar to fossil fuels in that biofuels contribute to [[air pollution]]. Burning produces [[carbon dioxide]], airborne carbon [[particulate]]s, [[carbon monoxide]] and [[nitrous oxide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/indoorair/interventions/antiguamod21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO estimates 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012 due to air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/ WHO | Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil burns significant amounts of ethanol biofuel. Gas [[chromatograph]] studies were performed of ambient air in São Paulo, Brazil, and compared to Osaka, Japan, which does not burn ethanol fuel. Atmospheric Formaldehyde was 160% higher in Brazil, and Acetaldehyde was 260% higher.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240399720_Atmospheric_alcohols_and_aldehydes_concentrations_measured_in_Osaka_Japan_and_in_Sao_Paulo_Brazil Atmospheric alcohols and aldehydes concentrations measured in Osaka, Japan and in São Paulo, Brazil&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Environmental Protection Agency has acknowledged in April 2007 that the increased use of bio-ethanol will lead to worse air quality. The total emissions of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides will rise due the growing use of bio-ethanol. There is an increase in carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels to produce the biofuels as well as nitrous oxide from the soil, which has most likely been treated with nitrogen fertilizer. Nitrous oxide is known to have a greater impact on the atmosphere in relation to global warming, as it is also an ozone destroyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haerens|first1=Margaret|title=Biofuels|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0-7377-5553-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue with biofuel use and production is the US has changed mandates many times because the production has been taking longer than expected.

===Banning of first-generation biofuels===
In the EU, the revised renewable energy directive calls for a complete ban on first-generation biofuels by 2030. Particularly fuels made from such oils such as palm oil and soy oil are being targeted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/04/palm-oil-biofuels-meps-eu-transport-deforestation-zsl-greenpeace-golden-agri-resources-oxfam MEPs vote to ban the use of palm oil in biofuels ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/eu-heading-for-zero-palm-oil-in-transport-by-2021/ EU heading for ‘zero palm oil’ in transport by 2021]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-climatechange-palmoil/eu-to-phase-out-palm-oil-from-transport-fuel-by-2030-idUSKBN1JA21F EU to phase out palm oil from transport fuel by 2030]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable biofuels===
{{main|Sustainable biofuels}}
Many of the biofuels that were being supplied in 2008 (using the first-generation biofuel production procedure) have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the [[natural environment]], [[food security]], and [[land use]].&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;&lt;ref name=sol/&gt; In 2008, the Nobel-prize winning chemist [[Paul J. Crutzen]] published findings that the release of [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) emissions in the production of biofuels means that overall they contribute more to global warming than the fossil fuels they replace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Greenhouse gas emissions===
Some scientists have expressed concerns about land-use change in response to greater demand for crops to use for biofuel and the subsequent carbon emissions.&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5867/1238 |title=Use of U.S. Croplands for Biofuels Increases Greenhouse Gases Through Emissions from Land-Use Change |last = Searchinger |first = Timothy |author2=Ralph Heimlich |author3=R.A.

However, no-till practices combined with cover-crop practices can reduce the payback period to three years for grassland conversion and 14 years for forest conversion.&lt;ref name="ES&amp;T"&gt;{{Cite journal |title =Biofuels, Land Use Change, and Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Some Unexplored Variables|last = Kim |first = Hyungtae|author2=Seungdo Kim|author3=Bruce E.

A study conducted in the Tocantis State, in northern Brazil, found that many families were cutting down forests in order to produce two conglomerates of oilseed plants, the J. curcas (JC group) and the R. communis (RC group). This region is composed of 15% Amazonian rainforest with high biodiversity, and 80% Cerrado forest with lower biodiversity. During the study, the farmers that planted the JC group released over 2193 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while losing 53-105 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sequestration from deforestation; and the RC group farmers released 562 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while losing 48-90 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be sequestered from forest depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alves Finco | first1 = Marcus V. | last2 = Doppler | first2 = Werner | year = 2010 | title = Bioenergy and Sustainable Development: The Dilemma of Food Security and Climate Change in the Brazilian Savannah | url = | journal = Energy for Sustainable Development | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 194–199 | doi = 10.1016/j.esd.2010.04.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these types of biofuels not only led into an increased emission of carbon dioxide, but also to lower efficiency of forests to absorb the gases that these farms were emitting. This has to do with the amount of fossil fuel the production of fuel crops involves. In addition, the intensive use of monocropping agriculture requires large amounts of water irrigation, as well as of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. This does not only lead to poisonous chemicals to disperse on water runoff, but also to the emission of nitrous oxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a fertilizer byproduct, which is three hundred times more efficient in producing a greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Runge | first1 = Ford | last2 = Senauer | first2 = Benjamin | year = 2007 | title = How Biofuels Could Starve the Poor | journal = Foreign Affairs | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 41–53 | jstor=20032348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Converting rainforests, peatlands, savannas, or grasslands to produce food crop–based biofuels in Brazil, Southeast Asia, and the United States creates a “biofuel carbon debt” by releasing 17 to 420 times more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions that these biofuels would provide by displacing fossil fuels. Biofuels made from waste biomass or from biomass grown on abandoned agricultural lands incur little to no carbon debt.&lt;ref name="Science2"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5867/1235.short |title =Land Clearing and the Biofuel Carbon Debt|last = fargione| first = Joseph|author2=Jason Hill |author3=David Tilman |author4=Stephen Polasky |author5=Peter Hawthorne |doi = 10.1126/science.1152747 |pmid =18258862|year=2008|accessdate = 12 November 2011 |journal=Science |volume=319 |issue=5867 |pages=1235–1238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water Use===
In addition to crop growth requiring water, biofuel facilities require significant process water.&lt;ref name="WaterI"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12039&amp;page=45 |title =Water Issues of Biofuel Production Plants |author=The National Academies Press |year=2008|accessdate = 18 June 2015 |journal=The National Academies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forests and Carbon Sequestration===
Scientific research (20th century) shows that carbon dioxide emissions from all forms of surface transport are converted in a few weeks by forests, farms and oceans into biomass. This implies that a greater emphasis on sustainable forestry is very relevant for climate protection and sustainable, energy-efficient transport.

==Current research==
Research is ongoing into finding more suitable biofuel crops and improving the oil yields of these crops. Using the current yields, vast amounts of land and fresh water would be needed to produce enough oil to completely replace fossil fuel usage. It would require twice the land area of the US to be devoted to soybean production, or two-thirds to be devoted to rapeseed production, to meet current US heating and transportation needs. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

As the primary source of biofuels in North America, many organizations are conducting research in the area of [[ethanol]] production. The National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center (NCERC) is a research division of [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]] dedicated solely to ethanol-based biofuel research projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ethanol Research |url=http://www.ethanolresearch.com/ethanolresearch/about.shtml |title=National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center (NCERC) |publisher=Ethanol Research |date=2012-04-02 |accessdate=2012-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320192458/http://www.ethanolresearch.com/ethanolresearch/about.shtml |archivedate=20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cellulosic ethanol commercialization]] is the process of building an industry out of methods of turning cellulose-containing organic matter into fuel. Companies, such as [[Iogen Corp.|Iogen]], [[POET]], and [[Abengoa]], are building refineries that can process [[biomass]] and turn it into [[bioethanol]]. Companies, such as [[Diversa]], [[Novozymes]], and [[Dyadic International|Dyadic]], are producing enzymes that could enable a [[cellulosic ethanol]] future. The shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players, from farmers to biotechnology firms, and from project developers to investors.&lt;ref&gt;Pernick, Ron and Wilder, Clint (2007). ''[[The Clean Tech Revolution]]'' p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the first commercial-scale plants to produce cellulosic biofuels have begun operating. Multiple pathways for the conversion of different biofuel feedstocks are being used. In the next few years, the cost data of these technologies operating at commercial scale, and their relative performance, will become available. Lessons learnt will lower the costs of the industrial processes involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/hlpe/hlpe_documents/HLPE_Reports/HLPE-Report-5_Biofuels_and_food_security.pdf |title=Biofuels and food security |author=HLPE |year=2013 |website= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parts of Asia and Africa where drylands prevail, [[sweet sorghum]] is being investigated as a potential source of food, feed and fuel combined. The crop is particularly suitable for growing in arid conditions, as it only extracts one seventh of the water used by sugarcane. In [[India]], and other places, sweet sorghum stalks are used to produce biofuel by squeezing the juice and then fermenting into [[ethanol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agribusinessweek.com/sweet-sorghum-a-new-smart-biofuel-crop/ |title=Sweet Sorghum : A New "Smart Biofuel Crop" |date=30 June 2008 |publisher=Agriculture Business Week |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004827/http://www.agribusinessweek.com/sweet-sorghum-a-new-smart-biofuel-crop/ |archivedate=27 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by researchers at the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop because it can provide fuel in addition to food and animal feed. With grain sorghum currently grown on over 11 million hectares (ha) in Asia and on 23.4 million ha in Africa, a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150904014010/http://resourcespace.icrisat.ac.in/filestore/8/4/0_6c06c9b61b19c20/840_be710da94740b90.pdf ''Sweet sorghum for food, feed and fuel''] New Agriculturalist, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fungi===
A group at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Moscow]], in a 2008 paper, stated they had isolated large amounts of lipids from single-celled fungi and turned it into biofuels in an economically efficient manner.

The '''Dutch Automated Vehicle Initiative (DAVI)''' is a research and demonstration initiative developing [[autonomous car|automated vehicle]]s for use on public roads.

The project is special in that, besides simply making driverless cars, it also focuses on having the automated vehicles share information amongst each other.&lt;ref&gt;http://davi.connekt.nl/about_davi/&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to have the cars helping to avoid traffic congestion, by reducing the safety distance between the cars (from 2 seconds drive distance now to just 0.5 seconds) and avoiding sudden traffic slow-downs (due to manoeuvres undertaken by drivers).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4427">A '''data infrastructure''' is a [[digital infrastructure]] promoting [[data sharing]] and consumption. 

Similarly to other [[infrastructures]], it is a structure needed for the operation of a society as well as the services and facilities necessary for an economy to function, the data economy in this case.

== Background ==
There is an intense discussion at international level on [[e-infrastructure]]s and data infrastructure serving scientific work. 
The European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) presented the first European roadmap for large-scale Research Infrastructures.&lt;ref&gt;European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures. (2010). Strategy Report on Research Infrastructures. Publications Office of the European Union. http://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/index_en.cfm?pg=esfri&lt;/ref&gt; 
These are modeled as layered hardware and software systems which support sharing of a wide spectrum of resources, spanning from networks, storage, computing resources, and system-level middleware software, to structured information within collections, archives, and databases. The [[e-Infrastructure Reflection Group]] (e-IRG) has proposed a similar vision. 
In particular, it envisions e-Infrastructures where the principles of global collaboration and [[shared resource]]s are intended to encompass the sharing needs of all research activities.&lt;ref&gt;e-Infrastructure Reflection Group. (2010). Blue Paper. E-IRG&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the framework of the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) e-infrastructure programme, e-Infrastructures are defined in terms of integration of networks, grids, [[data center]]s and [[collaborative software|collaborative environment]]s, and are intended to include supporting operation centers, service registries, credential delegation services, [[certificate authorities]], training and [[help desk]] services.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Information Systems Committee. (2006). e-Infrastructure Briefing Paper. JISC&lt;/ref&gt; The Cyberinfrastructure programme launched by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) plans to develop new research environments in which advanced computational, collaborative, data acquisition and management services are made available to researchers connected through high-performance networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Cyberinfrastructure Council|year=2007|title=Cyberinfrastructure Vision for the 21st Century Discovery|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2007/nsf0728/nsf0728.pdf|website=[[National Science Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

More recently, the vision for “global research data infrastructures” has been drawn by identifying a number of recommendations for developers of future research infrastructures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thanos, C.|year=2011|title=Global Research Data Infrastructures: The GRDI2020 Vision|url=http://www.grdi2020.eu/Repository/FileScaricati/fc14b1f7-b8a3-41f8-9e1e-fd803d28ba76.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This vision document highlighted the open issues affecting data infrastructures development – both technical and organizational – and identified future research directions. 
Besides these initiatives targeting “generic” infrastructures there are others oriented to specific domains, e.g. the [[European commission]] promotes the [[INSPIRE]] initiative for an e-Infrastructure oriented to the sharing of content and service resources of European countries in the ambit of [[geospatial data]]sets.&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament, Council. (2007, 3 14). Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2007 establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EIDR''', or the '''Entertainment Identifier Registry''', is a global unique identifier system for a broad array of audio visual objects, including [[film|motion pictures]], [[television]], and [[radio broadcasting|radio]] programs. The identification system resolves an [[identifier]] to a metadata record that is associated with top-level titles, edits, [[DVD]]s, encodings, clips, and mash-ups. EIDR also provides identifiers for Video Service providers, such as broadcast and cable networks.

As of February, 2018, EIDR contains over 1.8 million records, including 298K movies, and 794K episodes of over 25K TV series.
EIDR is an implementation of a [[Digital Object Identifier]] (DOI).

==History==

Media asset identification systems have existed for decades.  The common motivation for their creation is to enable the management of media assets through the assignment of a unique id to a set of metadata representing salient characteristics of each asset.  Over time such systems tend to proliferate, with each arising to deal with a specific set of issues.  As a result, there is considerable variation between systems in terms of which assets are categorized, which metadata is associated with each asset, and the very definition of an asset.  To name a few examples, should a “director’s cut” of a movie be distinct from the original theatrical release?  How should regional variations (e.g. translation of the title or dialog into foreign languages) be accounted for?  Further complications include the procedures (and required credentials) for adding new assets, editing existing assets, and creating derivative assets.

EIDR was created to address these issues, as well as others encountered in video asset workflows, both in a [[business to business|B2B]] context and the intramural post-production activities of content producers.  EIDR has the following characteristics:
*A central registry available to all participants
*Ability to easily register new assets
*An asset ID that is immutable (and in particular with respect to changes in asset ownership or location of the metadata or the asset itself)
*Detection/prevention of duplicates of the same asset being created
*Ability to create a set of video assets derived from an abstract work (e.g. original theatrical release, director’s cut, language-variants)
*Ability to group video assets by more general relationships (e.g. episodes of a season of a TV series)
*A core set of metadata to differentiate assets, even when closely related
*Scalable, immutable, persistent

EIDR is intended to supplement —not replace— existing asset identification systems.  To the contrary, a key feature is to allow an EIDR record to include references to that asset’s ID under other systems. This feature is particularly useful for film and television archives, making it easy for them to cross-reference their holdings with other sources for the work and metadata about it.  By design, EIDR does not replicate features of other asset ID systems, e.g. commercial systems that seek to add value through enhanced metadata (e.g. plot summaries, production details).  It is also a non-goal to track ownership and rights information, which can, however, be implemented as applications that use the EIDR ID.

==Content Model==

EIDR is built on a collection of records (which are further sub-divided into fields) that are stored in a central registry.  These records are referenced externally by DOIs, which are assigned when a record is created, and each identifier is immutable thereafter. The identifier resolution system underlying DOIs is the [[Handle System]] and so each native EIDR Content ID is a handle formatted, in increasing specificity, to handle, DOI and EIDR standards.

===Content ID Format===

The canonical form of an EIDR Content ID is an instance of a Handle and has the format:

:'''10.5240/XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-C'''
where
*'''10.5240''' is the DOI prefix for an EIDR asset.  The “10” indicates the handle is a DOI; other prefixes are assigned to other asset types (e.g. academic publications).  The digits between the “.” and “/” form the sub-prefix, which indicates which registration agency within the International DOI Foundation (IDF) has rights to manage these handles.  “5240” is assigned to the EIDR Association. 
*'''XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-C''' is the DOI suffix.  Each “X” denotes a hexadecimal digit (A-F), and “C” is an ISO 7064 Mod 37,6&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=31531 ISO/IEC 7064:2003]: Information technology -- Security techniques -- Check character systems. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; check digit.
There is also a 96-bit Compact Binary form that is intended for embedding in small payloads such as watermarks.   This form is generated from the canonical format as follows:
*16-bit sub-prefix: generated by interpreting the sub-prefix as a binary value, e.g. B’0001010001111000’
*80-bit suffix: the non-checksum part of the suffix, represented as 10 bytes 
The [[Uniform Resource Name|URN]] form for an EIDR ID is specified in IETF RFC 7302.

For use on the web an EIDR content ID can be represented as a URI in one of these forms:
*'''https&amp;#58;//doi.org/10.5240/XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-C''':  this is an EIDR ID represented as a DOI proxy reference (it will be redirected from DOI to the EIDR registry)
*'''info:doi:10.5240/XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-C [deprecated]''': this is an EIDR ID represented as an RFC 4452 compliant “info” URI (remembering that all EIDR IDs are also DOI IDs, but not the converse).

===Record Types===

There are four types of content records, each associated with a reserved prefix:
*'''Content ID''' (10.5240/XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-C): is associated with an entertainment asset such as a movie or TV series.  Content records are hierarchical, allowing relationships to be expressed such as a Series, whose children would be Seasons, whose children in turn would be individual episodes.  Many other relationships are supported, as described below.  Content records form the bulk of the data in the EIDR registry.
*'''Party ID''' (10.5237/XXXX-XXXX): identifies entities such as registrants, content producers, and distributors.
*'''Video Service ID''' (10.5239/XXXX-XXXX): Identifies a video service, colloquially known as a “channel” or “network”: a (usually) linear sequence of content scheduled to be broadcast at specified times (e.g. the Service ID for the Cartoon Network is 10.5239/8BE5-E3F6).  Video services are hierarchical: for example, a parent may have several children to account for regional or language variations).
*'''User ID''' (10.5238/[0-9a-zA-Z_.#()]{2-32}): Identifies a user using a string of 2–32 alphanumeric and selected special characters (illustrated here with [[PERL]] syntax).  A User is primarily an administrative concept that is subordinate to Parties (from whom they inherit access rights). Unlike the other EIDR DOIs, the User ID can only be used within EIDR (e.g. programming APIs).

The sub-prefixes 5237, 5238, 5239, and 5240 are all assigned to the EIDR Association.

===Content Records===

Content records are objects categorized by their types and relationships.  Each has three different (orthogonal) kinds of type:
*'''Object Type''': there are a total of 10 of these.  First is the Basic Type, which has the minimal fields necessary to describe a content record.  The other 9 are derived from the basic type, and contain extra fields for describing more complex objects.
*'''Structural Type''': these distinguish representations of a work and are listed in increasing order of specificity:
**'''Abstraction''': Used for objects having no reality, such as a series container or the most basic concept of the original work. This corresponds to the [[International Standard Musical Work Code]] (ISWC) for musical works, the [[International Standard Text Code]] (ISTC) for textual works, or the [[International Standard Audiovisual Number]] (ISAN) for audiovisual works.
**'''Performance''': Used for items that are particular versions of a work, such as the original theatrical release or director’s cut of a film or a locally censored version of a TV show. This roughly corresponds to the [[International Standard Recording Code]] (ISRC) for musical works and to some uses of the Version ISAN (V-ISAN) for audiovisual works.
**'''Digital''': A particular digital representation of a work, such as an [[MPEG-2]] encoding of a movie. This corresponds to some uses of the V-ISAN.
*'''Referent Type''': the type of the content asset, independent of a particular manifestation (e.g. a movie shown on TV is still a movie):
**'''Series''': An Abstraction that contains ordered or unordered individual items.
**'''Season''': A second level of grouping below a Series, usually covering a time interval
**'''TV''': Content that first appeared via broadcast.
**'''Movie''': Long-form content that first appeared in a theater (in the United States) or a cinema (in most of the rest of the world).
**'''Short''': Loosely defined to cover a work that is 40 minutes or less, such as music videos, theatrical newsreels, or theatrical or DTV cartoon shorts.
**'''Web''': Content that first appeared on the Web. This is different from content from elsewhere that has been made available on the Web.
**'''Interactive Material''': Content that is not strictly audio-visual. It covers DVD menus, interactive TV overlays, customized players, etc.
**'''Compilation''': Content composed of multiple other assets that cannot be more precisely described, such as a box set of a film franchise.
**'''Supplemental''': This type is for secondary content whose primary purpose is to support, augment, or promote other content. Examples include trailers, outtakes, and promotion documentaries (“making of” pieces).

===Basic Metadata===

The following fields (taken from a larger set) comprise the base object data of a content record:
*'''Structural Type''': e.g. Abstraction
*'''Mode''': e.g. AudioVisual (for a movie or TV program); “Audio” for a radio program; “Visual” for a silent work.
*'''Referent Type''': e.g. Movie
*'''Title''': the primary title.  Titles and Alternate Titles are further distinguished by:
**'''Lang''': the language of the title expressed as [[ISO 639-1]] code
**'''Class''': release or regional
*'''Alternate Title 1..N''': one or more alternate titles (often regional or language variants)
*'''Original Language''': the language of the original release expressed as ISO 639-1 code
*'''Associated Org 1..N''': Party ID(s) of producer, studio, etc.
*'''Release Date''': date title was originally released
*'''Country of Origin''': [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|ISO 3166-1 alpha 2]] code, with extensions for defunct countries
*'''Approximate Length''': expressed as XML Schema xs:duration&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#duration W3C XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition]&lt;/ref&gt; datatype
*'''Alternate ID 1..N''': one or more equivalent IDs expressed in a different asset ID system (see discussion below).
*'''Credits''': only skeletal credits are provided, typically restricted to the director and up to four of the main actors.  As noted, it is a non-goal for EIDR to compete with proprietary systems with rich metadata (e.g. plot summaries).   The main goal is to assist with disambiguating the title, and helping with validation and de-duplication efforts.
*'''Registrant''': the party that created this content record (e.g. “10.5237/superparty”)
*'''Creation Date''': date this content record was created
*'''Status''': normally “valid” (there are special cases for deleted records)
*'''Last Modification Date''': last time this content record was changed

===Deleted Content Records===
An EIDR ID must be always resolvable, thus under normal circumstances the corresponding Content Record will be permanent.   There are two mechanisms available to deal with errors or other unusual circumstances.  The preferred one is aliasing, whereby an EIDR ID is transparently redirected to another content record.  Aliasing is commonly employed to deal with an asset being registered twice.

The other mechanism is the use of tombstone records.  This is employed when the Content Record is corrupted, or an otherwise invalid asset was accidentally registered.  In this case the ID will be aliased to a special tombstone record.  The tombstone can be recognized by applications because its EIDR ID field will be set to the distinguished value “'''[https://ui.eidr.org/view/content?id=10.5240/0000-0000-0000-0000-0000-X 10.5240/0000-0000-0000-0000-0000-X]'''”.  Note that “X” means the 24th letter of the Latin alphabet (ASCII 0x58 or U+0058).

===Alternate ID===
Having a rich set of Alternate IDs for content is one of the primary goals of EIDR.  This allows EIDR IDs to be used everywhere in content workflows; if an alternate ID is needed it can be found in the metadata for the EIDR ID.  EIDR supports the inclusion both proprietary and other standard (e.g. ISAN) ID references.  Additional Alternate IDs can be added when needed (e.g. by parties wanting to support new workflows).  Below is an example of alternate IDs for the EIDR asset [https://ui.eidr.org/view/content?id=10.5240/EA73-79D7-1B2B-B378-3A73-M 10.5240/EA73-79D7-1B2B-B378-3A73-M] (the movie “Blade Runner”). If an Alternate ID is resolvable algorithmically, for example by placing it appropriately in a template URL, EIDR makes that link available.

Alternate IDs are partitioned into non-proprietary and proprietary.  The former have distinguished, predefined types (e.g. those issued by ISAN, [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]], and IVA), whereas proprietary IDs are all of type “Proprietary”, and are further distinguished by an associated DNS domain.  As of July, 2017, there are over 2 million Alternate IDs directly available through EIDR.

===Relationships Between Objects===

Content objects can be related to each other according to the following table.  These relations are expressed as additional fields in the content record and are thus relative to that object.  Note that the subject object is the child and the target is the parent (e.g. subject is&lt;relation-type&gt;Of parent).  Additional constraints are noted in the table.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| colspan="2" | '''Inheritance Relationships''': The object on which the relationship exists can inherit basic metadata fields from the object to which the relationship refers. Only one inheritance relationship may exist on an object. These relationships produce a tree structure rooted in the EIDR ID for an abstraction.

==Use in Standards &amp; Applications==
Use in Standards &amp; Applications
EIDR has been incorporated into many standards.  A few of the more significant ones are listed here:
*'''[[SMPTE]]/AMWA''': SMPTE Recommended Practice RP 2079&lt;ref&gt;[https://kws.smpte.org/kws/public/projects/project/details?project_id=162 SMPTE RP 2079].  DOI Name and EIDR Identifier Representation.&lt;/ref&gt; standardizes use of EIDR in [[MXF]] media containers, at the heart of professional content workflows, including AMWA AS-03&lt;ref&gt;Advanced Media Workflow Association [http://www.amwa.tv/projects/AS-03.shtml AS-03 MXF Program Delivery Specification].&lt;/ref&gt; and AS-11&lt;ref&gt;Advanced Media Workflow Association [http://www.amwa.tv/projects/AS-11.shtml AS-11 MFX for Contribution Specification].&lt;/ref&gt; specifications.  SMTPE Recommended Practice 2021-5&lt;ref&gt;[http://standards.smpte.org/content/978-1-61482-774-0/rp-2021-5-2013/SEC1.refs SMPTE RP 2021-5:2013].  Using Ad-ID and EIDR as Alternate Identifiers in SMPTE BXF and ATSC PMCP.&lt;/ref&gt; allows an EIDR Identifier to be carried wherever BXF is used for exchange of data among broadcast systems.
*'''[[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU)''': EBUCore&lt;ref&gt;[https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3293.pdf EBU TECH 3293].  EBU CORE METADATA SET Version 1.5.&lt;/ref&gt; is a common core set of descriptive and technical metadata that describe media resources (audio, video, still images, subtitling, etc.).  EBU and EIDR staff have produced a mapping of EBUCore for base records to EIDR root objects: .. EIDR and EBU are working together in the SMPTE Core working group to define descriptive metadata for SMPTE-based specifications and workflows.  EIDR is one of the standards supported by the EBU Core.
*'''[[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]]''': EIDR is referenced in draft DVB specifications for companion screens&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dvb.org/resources/public/standards/a167-2_dvb-css_part_2-content-id-and-media-sync.zip DVB Document A167-2].Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB);
Companion Screens and Streams; Part 2: Content Identification and Media Synchronisation, July, 2014. p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; (tm-sm-css-0017r14).
*'''MPEG''': EIDR has been proposed as a content identifier in the Multimedia Preservation Application Format&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=66430 ISO/IEC CD 23000-15].  Information technology - Multimedia application format (MPEG-A) -- Part 15: Multimedia preservation application format.&lt;/ref&gt; that is being defined for archival use.
*'''CableLabs (US)''': EIDR is part of the CableLabs Metadata&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cablelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/specdocs/MD-SP-AMIv3.0-I02-121210.pdf MD-SP-AMIv3.0-I02-121210]. CableLabs Asset Management Interface 3.0 Specification.&lt;/ref&gt; standard for the distribution of video on demand assets.  EIDR is one program identifier that can be present in an SCTE-35 2013&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scte.org/documents/pdf/standards/ANSI_SCTE%2035%202013.pdf ANSI/SCTE 35 2013]. Digital Program Insertion Cueing Message for Cable.&lt;/ref&gt; segmentation descriptor, a standard used in IP distribution over cable.  EIDR is also used in Dynamic Ad Insertion (DAI) products using the SCTE 130&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scte.org/documents/pdf/standards/SCTE%20130-10%202013.pdf SCTE 130-10 2013].   Digital Program Insertion – Advertising Systems Interfaces, Part 10.&lt;/ref&gt; standard architecture.
*'''EIDR and Alternate IDs''': In order to promote interoperability of EIDR with a wide variety of systems, EIDR includes an “AlternateID” field to cross-reference existing IDs systems.  Alternate IDs may include, for example, CRID (RFC 4078), ISAN, ISRC, [[Universal Product Code|UPC]], or [[Uniform resource identifier|URI]], as well as commercial ID systems such as [[Ad-ID]], Baseline, IMDb, etc. Currently about half of EIDR records carry an ID from at least one other system.
*'''Mapping from other Standard Metadata and Identifiers to EIDR''': Other metadata and identifier systems can be directly mapped into EIDR:
**'''EN 15907 and EN 15744''': These standards are under the auspices of the [[European Committee for Standardization]] CEN/TC 372 and filmstandards.org.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmstandards.org/fsc/index.php/How_EN_15744_and_EN_15907_came_into_being TC 372 Workshop Compendium].  How EN 15744 and EN 15907 came into being.&lt;/ref&gt;  Best practices and mappings are available for EN 15907 and EN 15744 root objects.  EIDR is also working with film archives to extend interoperability with these standards to a more granular level of detail, including a project with the British Film Institute (BFI) to register their EN 15907-based records with EIDR.
**'''International Standard Audiovisual Number (ISAN)''': ISAN is widely used in rights management and collection systems.  A complete mapping of an ISAN registration to an EIDR registration is available. The UK Audio-Visual Registration Agency, a joint venture between EIDR and ISAN-UK provides joint registration services for both identifiers. Precursors to this service have been used to obtain EIDR IDs and ISANs for broadcast content from ITV (a commercial TV network in the United Kingdom).
EIDR identifiers have found their way into an increasing number of commercial applications.  The following are illustrative of some of the advantages of using EIDR:
*'''Warner Brothers-Xbox integration''': EIDR was used to improve the implementation of an [[Electronic sell-through|Electronic Sell Through]] (EST) system for delivering Warner Theatrical titles to Microsoft [[Xbox Live]] customers.  The operation of an electronic storefront requires several groups within Warner Brothers to coordinate their activities with the Xbox team.  The outbound side of the distribution chain included publishing “Avails” (titles available for sale) and tracking order fulfillment; the inbound side included placing orders.  Other functions such as reports spanned both sides of the distribution chain.  The original system required manual intervention and supervision, particularly at boundaries between organizations.  An example of the need for manual processing would be verifying that the correct version of an asset (which can vary depending on subtitles or content) was delivered.  In the new system Warner Brothers created a new EIDR ID for each content variant, and these were used for all subsequent processing stages.  This eliminated ambiguity and facilitated the automation of the inbound, outbound stages.  Another advantage was the ability to create reports on the fly.
*'''Swisscom EPG integration''': Swisscom operates a Pay TV service in Switzerland. In 2014 it completed the rollout of an [[Electronic program guide|Electronic Programming Guide]] (EPG) for its customers based on EIDR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eidr.org/swisscom-ppsmedia-press-tv Press Release].  Swisscom completes the first European deployment of the Entertainment ID Registry with media-press.tv.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an end-to-end system where EIDR IDs are used to represent the assets displayed in the EPG.  A key element of the system was that EIDR IDs were also used in the guide metadata supplied to Swisscom by media-press.tv.  This included setting up a system for assigning EIDR IDs to assets that were not already in the registry.  A key advantage of using EIDR is not having to translate between different identifier systems.

==Operations &amp; Administrative==
EIDR is administered by the non-profit EIDR Association, which was founded in October 2010 by [[Movielabs|MovieLabs]], [[CableLabs]], [[Comcast]] and [[Rovi]].  Membership has grown steadily since then: as of late-2014 it has 79 members divided between the Industry Promoters and Industry Contributor levels.  The fastest growing category is non-US companies, which now accounts for about 20% of membership.
The EIDR Association operates two EIDR registries: Production and Sandbox.  The former is the official site, and the latter is reserved for test and development.  Both systems are available publicly online, but the contents of the sandbox are not guaranteed to be correct, complete, or even to refer to assets that exist.  Only members of the EIDR association may modify the registry.

===Registration===
Registration of new assets can be done individually or in bulk (up to 100,000 assets at a time).  In either case, the workflow comprises a combination of automated (to perform well-defined but tedious tasks) and manual (where human judgment is called for) processes.  It is also iterative, as the initial matching process may identify a variety of gaps and errors that need to be dealt with.

Registering new assets is a complex process that requires some preparation, particularly in the case of bulk submission.  The automated processes will check syntax, make sure that the basic metadata is supplied, and that any dependencies (e.g. series records created before constituent episodes) are honored.  Manual steps include making sure the correct Parties are associated with the asset.  One of the most important steps is ensuring that a new asset does not already exist in the registry: this is covered in the next section.

In order to register a new asset a user must be associated with a party that has been granted the “Registrant” role by the EIDR operator.   A registrant may be a principal agent, such as a studio or an encoding house, but it may also be a Party doing bulk registration of back‐catalogue items, or a Party acting on behalf of someone else.   It is also a requirement that a registrant be an EIDR member.  In general, content ownership, metadata authority, and registration capability are separate and unrelated concepts.

===Deduplication===
This refers to flagging assets being submitted to the registry as falling into one of the following three categories:
*Candidate asset is unique (with respect to existing registry assets).
*Candidate asset is a duplicate of an existing record.
*Candidate asset has a high probability of being a duplicate.
This assessment is based on applying a (large) set of rules to the candidate asset, which results a numerical score.  Bucketing occurs as the result of comparing the score to two thresholds:
*'''Low Threshold''': any asset with a score below this value is deemed not to be a duplicate.  This is the only case when a proposed record addition or modification will succeed.
*'''High Threshold''': any asset with a score above this value is deemed to (almost certainly) be a duplicate.  The proposed record addition/modification will not proceed, and an error status will be returned.  Registrants will generally use the pre-existing ID for the item they tried to register, and can add missing information and Alternate IDs to the existing record.
Assets falling between the low and high threshold are deemed to have a high possibility of being a duplicate: the proposed record addition/modification will not proceed until manually reviewed by EIDR operations staff.

==Architecture==
The components of the EIDR system are shown below.
[[File:EIDR Architecture 01.png|thumb|right|500px|EIDR Registry Architecture]]

The principal functional blocks are as follows:
*'''Core Registry''': This module is a customization and configuration of the CNRI Digital Object Repository. It performs various functions including registration, generation of unique identifiers, indexing, object storage management, and access control.
*'''Repository''': This stores and provides access to registered objects; for EIDR, these objects are collections of metadata, not the media assets themselves. The metadata includes standard object information, relationships, and access control settings.
*'''REST AP'''I: A [[Representational state transfer|REST]] interface that provides access to the full set of non-administrative registry features.  Services can make individual or batched calls, which can be dispatched synchronously or asynchronously.  A general query syntax enables the retrieval (and in some cases modification) of registry records satisfying a set of criteria specified by the caller.
**'''EIDR SDK''': this is provided to developers to facilitate the creation of third party applications (usually in support of a B2B or intramural workflow).  It comprises a Java SDK, a .NET SDK, and sample programs built upon the two SDKs.  Using the SDK is recommended over direct calls to the REST API.
**'''Command Line Tools''': these are simple Java and .NET applications, built on the SDK, each of which provides a single function, such as resolve, query, match, and register.
**'''Web UI''': a Web-based user interface primarily for search, lookup, and browsing the object hierarchy. It also supports simple registrations.
*'''DOI Proxy''': Using the handle prefix, this forwards EIDR DOI resolution requests to the EIDR registry.
*'''Handle System''': Provides distributed lookup and resolution services

===Relation to DOI and Handle System===

An EIDR ID is a specialized example of a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which in turn is built on top of the Handle System developed by the [[Corporation for National Research Initiatives]] (CNRI).  The EIDR-specific aspects of the lower layers are described in more detail below.

===Digital Object Identifier (EIDR Aspects)===
A Digital Object Identifier, standardized as ISO 26324,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=43506 ISO 26324:2012]:  Information and documentation -- Digital object identifier system, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; seeks to uniquely identify a wide range of digital artifacts including books, recordings, research data, and other digital content.  The goal is not just for the IDs to be unique, but persistent and immutable.  As opposed to URLs, DOI identifiers stay the same even if the objects move to another location, or become owned by another organization.  Here are some of the characteristics of DOI:
*The International DOI Foundation (IDF) enforces previously agreed rules on the constituent Registration Agencies (e.g. EIDR) to ensure continuity.  In particular, if an RA ceases operation, the names it hosts will be taken over by another RA.
*The IDF defines rules to which all DOI names must adhere (what kinds of object may be named by a specific RA)
*The DOI system provides a data model, based on a data dictionary, to enable a structured means of expressing metadata (and inter-object relationships).
*The DOI system has its own highly redundant and distributed set of handle and proxy servers.
*All DOI prefixes are of the form “10.NNNN” where 10 is a directory indicator and “NNNN” is a registrant code in the range 1-65535 (e.g. EIDR content records use is 10.5240)
The DOI data model provides the means to associate metadata with each object, as well as policies governing its use.  In the words of the DOI Handbook, metadata may include “names, identifiers, descriptions, types, classifications, locations, times, measurements, relationships and any other kind of information related to [an object].”  Metadata flows between the following entities:
*'''Resource Provider''': usually the owner of media asset, which is responsible for inputting metadata to the system.
*'''Registration Agency''': the entities that serves as the repository of the assets (and associated metadata).  As noted DOI supports a federation of independent RA’s, each responsible for a set of assets.  EIDR is one such RA. Others include CrossRef for scholarly articles, DataCite for research data, and OPOCE for official publications of the European Union.
*'''Service User''': the entities making queries to RA’s retrieve metadata associated with assets.  The DOI resolution framework is responsible for dispatching a query to the appropriate RA (the Service User doesn’t need to know this).
To foster interoperability between RAs, DOI has the concept of a metadata Kernel.  This is a core set of metadata that all objects stored within the DOI framework should have.  The full set may be found in the DOI handbook.  Interoperability is a large topic extending beyond the scope of EIDR, but the following subset is particularly relevant to EIDR assets:
*'''referent''': an object maintained in the DOI system.  
*'''referentName''': the name of the referent (e.g. the title of a movie)
*'''primaryReferentType''': For EIDR, this includes creation (e.g. entertainment assets) and party (e.g. the creator thereof).
*'''structuralType''': these are mutually exclusive categories that identify the form of an asset. Two particularly relevant to EIDR assets are abstraction (an umbrella term referring to an object such as a movie that may exist in multiple forms) and performance (a specific instance of an object such as Director’s Cut).
*'''principalAgent''': for creations, the entity principally responsible for its existence.
*'''registrationAuthorityCode''': denotes the agency that issued the DOI.  This would be the EIDR RA for EIDR assets.
EIDR metadata is available in standard DOI kernel metadata format as well as EIDR-specific formats.  The DOI for the DOI metadata schema is [https://doi.org/10.1000/276 doi:10.1000/276] .

===Handle System (EIDR Aspects)===

DOI is in turn implemented on top of the Handle System, a distributed, highly scalable, name resolution service.  A handle is defined as:

::&lt;Handle&gt; ::= &lt;Handle Naming Authority&gt; "/" &lt;Handle Local Name&gt;

The Naming Authority is globally unique and defines both an administrative space and the syntax of the Handle Local Name.  For EIDR in the definition above, the “10.5240” is the EIDR Naming Authority, and is responsible for resolving the suffix (including that it conforms to the expected syntax for an EIDR asset).  The range of allowable Naming Authorities is more general than is employed by DOI (or EIDR).

The distributed nature of the Handle System allows each local namespace to be hosted on multiple geographically distributed service sites.  This is a federated model where each local name space has complete control over the placement and operation of its service sites.  Furthermore, each service site may contain multiple resolution servers: requests directed to a particular service site will be dispatched evenly across its constituent servers.

The data model of the Handle System is simple but flexible.  An arbitrary number of values may be associated with each handle.  Over time, these values may be created, modified, and destroyed.  Each such datum has the following attributes:
*'''index''': an unsigned integer that identifies a data value from the others that may exist for this handle.
*'''type''': a UTF-8 string identifying the type.  The type system is extensible and common types are maintained as handles in the “0.TYPE” naming authority.  There are no restrictions on the creation of new types, although using resolvable handles as type names is recommended best practice. Common types include URL for a single of indirection, “10320/loc” for a set of context-based resolution alternatives, and various administrative types for Handle System management, all of which are based on handle resolution.
*'''data''': the value itself, represented as a sequence of octets which are interpreted in the context of the associated type
*'''permission''': access rights to this particular value.  Note that different data values of a handle may have different permissions
*'''TTL''': an integer that specifies how long a value may be cached
*'''timestamp''': an integer (expressed as milliseconds from the Unix epoch) that records the last time the value was updated
*'''reference''': a list of references to other handle values.  These are usually used to add credentials (e.g. a digital signature).

Accessing the Handle System is done via a wire protocol defined in RFC 3652; EIDR applications don’t have to be concerned with this because of the layering of protocols.

'''EMML (Enterprise Mobility Mark-up Language)''' is an extension of the [[HTML]] language. It is less of a strict set of functions and tags, but more a standard for providing developers of web-based mobility applications a means to configure, control and retrieve information from additional input devices and features of rugged mobile computers.

== History ==

=== EMML 1.0 ===
EMML was first devised by James Morley-Smith in 2001, when working as a Software Developer at [[Symbol Technologies]] (now a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Motorola|Motorola, Inc]]). As part of the first version of Symbol’s PocketBrowser, EMML was originally a mechanism for providing access to the barcode scanner built into many of Symbol's enterprise mobility devices. It was extended to include features such as [[WLAN]] signal indicators, power statistics and access to the communications port to allow for input from custom devices such as magnetic card readers and temperature probes.

EMML 1.0 support is currently offered by commercial browsers and development tools from companies such as [[Naurtech]], [[Intermec]], [[Wavelink]], and [http://www.georgiasoftworks.com Georgia Softworks] &lt;ref&gt;Documentation: [http://www.georgiasoftworks.com/docs/gswbrowse/gswbrowse_usersguide.pdf Georgia SoftWorks GSWBrowse for Windows RF Devices] Retrieved 2011-07-08&lt;/ref&gt;
.

=== EMML 1.1 ===
In 2009 Motorola created an updated version of EMML in order to co-ordinate it with other Internet standards, most notably [[CSS]]. There was a clear focus on simplifying the standard and reducing the amount of redundant code. In doing so, the number of bytes required to be downloaded was reduced and the readability of the language was vastly improved.

Previously, all parameters had to be supplied to each META function individually. This meant that each module might have several [[Meta tag|META tags]], each taking up several [[byte]]s worth of data. In EMML 1.1, parameters can be supplied in a semi-colon delimited list, much like styles in a CSS style block in HTML.

== Characteristics ==

=== Usage of The META Tag ===
EMML utilizes the [[Meta tag|META tag]] from the HTML language to set properties and specify [[Callback (computer science)|callback functions]] by which the browser returns information. According to the [[W3C]] the META Tag is: "an extensible container for use in identifying specialized document meta-information".&lt;ref name="w3cmeta"&gt;[http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_5.html#SEC5.2.5 W3C Hypertext Markup Language - 2.0]&lt;/ref&gt;

In EMML, the &lt;code&gt;http-equiv&lt;/code&gt; parameter is primarily used to identify the module of functionality. The &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; parameter is used to set properties, methods, and associated events.

== Actions ==
There are three main actions in the EMML language:
# Setting property values
# Invoking methods
# Retrieving information through events

=== Setting Property Values ===
In EMML, setting properties is a case of providing the module and property to set, followed by the value.

==== In EMML 1.0 ====
'''''Example 1.''''' The following is an example of setting the x-position in pixels of the on screen battery indicator in EMML 1.0:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="battery" content="x=100" /&gt; 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''''Example 2.''''' This is an example of several parameters being applied to the battery module using EMML 1.0:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="battery" content="x=10" /&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="battery" content="y=10" /&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="battery" content="rgb:ff,00,00" /&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==== In EMML 1.1====
The example shown in '''''Example 2.''''' in [[#In_EMML_1.0.5B1.5D|In EMML 1.0]] can be written this way in EMML 1.1:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="battery" content="left:10; top:10; color:#ff0000;" /&gt; 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

It is immediately apparent in the example from EMML 1.1 that there is less redundant information. It may also be observed that the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; parameters from EMML 1.0 have been substituted for the &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; parameters familiar to CSS. This is also true for the &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; EMML 1.0 parameters that have become &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; in EMML 1.1. The way in which color is described was also changed to the &lt;code&gt;#rrggbb&lt;/code&gt; format of HTML and CSS.

=== Invoking Methods ===
Methods are written in a way similar to setting a property. Again, the module appears in the &lt;code&gt;http-equiv&lt;/code&gt; parameter, and the action in the &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; parameter.

==== In EMML 1.0 ====
The following would cause the on screen battery indicator to be displayed:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="battery" content="show" /&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==== In EMML 1.1 ====
The &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; method from EMML 1.0 was dropped in favor of the &lt;code&gt;visibility&lt;/code&gt; parameter with the &lt;code&gt;visible&lt;/code&gt; value, similarly &lt;code&gt;hide&lt;/code&gt; is now the &lt;code&gt;hidden&lt;/code&gt; value of the &lt;code&gt;visibility&lt;/code&gt; parameter.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="battery" content="left:10; top:10; color:#ff0000; visibility:visible;" /&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Retrieving Information Through Events ===
Retrieving information is carried out by specifying a callback function to which the EMML browser returns information.  Typically, META functions which return information were named as the module name followed by the word "navigate".  The callback function could be a [[URL]], where the data is passed as [[Attribute-value pair|named-value pairs]] in the query string, or a [[JavaScript]] function or variable.

==== In EMML 1.0 ====
The following is how you would set all of these for the &lt;code&gt;batterynavigate&lt;/code&gt; function in EMML 1.0

''Note: all of these methods would not be included in one document, they are included here as an example.''

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;!-- A call-back to a URL --&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="batterynavigate" content="http://myserver/mypage.html?ACLineStatus=%s&amp;BatteryLifePercent=%s&amp;BackupBatteryLifePercent=%s" /&gt;
&lt;!-- A call-back to a JavaScript function --&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="batterynavigate" content="Javascript:doBattery('%s', '%s', '%s');" /&gt;
&lt;!-- A call-back to a JavaScript variable --&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="batterynavigate" content="Javascript:var bACLine = '%s'; var iBattPC = '%s'; var iBkUpPC ='%s';" /&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In EMML 1.0, you specify a place holder for each value you are interested in using a &lt;code&gt;%s&lt;/code&gt;.  This has the drawback of requiring the developer to supply a placeholder for inconsequential values. For example, placeholders would be required for 8 values, even if only the 1st and 8th values were of interest.

==== In EMML 1.1 ====
In EMML 1.1 events have a parameter value for each event and each module can therefore support more than one event.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="battery"  content="batteryevent:url('http://myserver/mypage.html?ACLineStatus=%s&amp;BatteryLifePercent=%s&amp;BackupBatteryLifePercent=%s');" /&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Or

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="battery" content="batteryevent:url('Javascript:doBatt('%s', '%s');');" /&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In EMML 1.1, the &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; can be substituted for a numerical value representing the position of the value of interest.  Therefore, if requesting the 1st and 8th values from the &lt;code&gt;signalevent&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;signal&lt;/code&gt; module, the tag might be written as follows:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="signal" content="signalevent:url('Javascript:doWLAN('%1', '%8');');" /&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== EMML Profiles (EMMP) ==
Also added in EMML 1.1 were EMML Profiles.  EMML Profiles are similar to CSS style sheets.  An EMML Profile allows for the creation of EMML classes&amp;mdash;a common set of EMML META tags which can be applied to a page or element.

Below is an example of an EMML Profile Page:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="css"&gt;
.inventoryBarcodes {
   scanner-alldecoders:       disabled;
   scanner-code128redundancy: true;
   scanner-code128minlength:  10;
   scanner-code128maxlength:  16;
   scanner-code128:           enabled;
   scanner-ean13:             enabled;
   scanner-i2of5:             enabled;  
}

.inventoryBattery {
   battery-left:              10;
   battery-top:               0;
   battery-visibility:        visible;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

EMML Profiles are stored in &lt;code&gt;.emmp&lt;/code&gt; files; these can be linked to the HTML document using the &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; method of the &lt;code&gt;EMMLProfile&lt;/code&gt; module. This is an example of how an EMMP file would be linked:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;META HTTP-Equiv="emmlprofile" Content="source:url('http://myserver/inventoryprofiles.emmp'); import;"&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

''Note: Each META tag is parsed from left to right applying each component part in turn. Therefore, in the above example, the ''&lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; ''parameter will be set before the ''&lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;'' method is called.  The same is true for EMML Profiles which are applied from top downwards.''

When a profile page is linked, the class name can simply be referenced, and with that, all the parameters in the profile can be applied with one command.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="emmlprofile" content="apply:inventoryBarcode; apply:inventoryBattery" /&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

As can be seen from the example above, it is possible to set any number of profiles. When doing this, however, one should be aware of conflicting parameters.

'''EM Microelectronic-Marin SA''', based in [[Marin, Neuchâtel|Marin]] near [[Neuchâtel]] in [[Switzerland]], is a developer and [[semiconductor]] manufacturer specialized in the design and production of ultra low power, low voltage integrated circuits for battery-operated and field-powered applications in consumer, automotive and industrial areas. EM Microelectronic-Marin SA is a subsidiary of [[The Swatch Group]].&lt;ref name=official&gt;[http://www.emmicroelectronic.com/Company.asp EM Microelectronic-Marin corporate website] (retrieved 20 January 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

EM Microelectronic-Marin (also known as EM Micro, EM-Marin or simply '''EM''')&lt;ref name=official/&gt; was founded in 1975 as a division of the Swiss Ebauches Electronics SA (a member of the [[Allgemeine Gesellschaft der Schweizerischen Uhrenindustrie|ASUAG]] group of companies).&lt;ref&gt;[http://smithsonianchips.si.edu/ice/cd/PROF98/EUROPE.PDF Smithsonian 'The Chip Collection' European Company Profiles 1998 pp4-20 to 4-22]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently ASUAG became part of [[Société de Microélectronique et d'Horlogerie|SMH]] Swiss Corporation for Microelectronics and Watchmaking Industries Ltd. In 1998 SMH became known as The Swatch Group.

==Subsidiaries==

EM Microelectronic has a design center at its headquarters in Marin, in the French speaking part of Switzerland near the city and lake of [[Neuchâtel]]. In order to support its activities worldwide, EM has subsidiaries and additional design centers: 
* EM Microelectronic - US Inc., located in Colorado Springs, Colorado (USA), is a subsidiary of EM Microelectronic which is aimed at serving North American customers.

An '''edge case''' is a problem or situation that occurs only at an extreme (maximum or minimum) operating [[parameter]].  For example, a stereo speaker might noticeably distort audio when played at maximum volume, even in the absence of any other extreme setting or condition.

An edge case can be expected or unexpected. In [[engineering]], the process of planning for and gracefully addressing edge cases can be a significant task, and yet this task may be overlooked or underestimated.

Non-trivial edge cases can result in the failure of an object that is being engineered. They may not have been foreseen during the [[design]] phase. And they may not have been thought possible during normal use of the object. For this reason, attempts to formalize good engineering standards often include information about edge cases.

==Software engineering==
In programming, an edge case typically involves input values that require special handling in an [[algorithm]] behind a computer program.  As a measure for validating the behavior of computer programs in such cases, [[Unit testing|unit tests]] are usually created; they are testing [[Boundary case|boundary conditions]] of an [[algorithm]], [[Subroutine|function]] or [[Method (computer programming)|method]]. A series of edge cases around each "boundary" can be used to give reasonable [[Code coverage|coverage]] and confidence using the assumption that if it behaves correctly at the edges, it should behave everywhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a function that divides two numbers might be tested using both very large and very small numbers. This assumes that if it works for both ends of the magnitude spectrum, it should work correctly in between.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8292">[[File:Hydraulicky lis.svg|thumb|right|Illustration of force multiplication by linked hydraulic cylinders,a fundamental feature of fluid power.]]

'''Fluid power''' is the use of fluids under pressure to generate, control, and transmit power.  Fluid power is subdivided into [[hydraulics]] using a liquid such as  [[mineral oil]] or [[water]], and [[pneumatics]] using a gas such as air or other gases. Compressed-air and water-pressure systems were once used to transmit power from a central source to industrial users over extended geographic areas; '''fluid power''' systems today are usually within a single building or mobile machine. 

Fluid power systems perform work by a pressurized fluid bearing directly on a piston in a cylinder or in a fluid motor. A fluid cylinder produces a force resulting in linear motion, whereas a fluid motor produces torque resulting in rotary motion. Within a fluid power system, cylinders and motors (also called [[actuators]]) do the desired work. Control components such as valves regulate the system.

A fluid power system  has a pump driven by a prime mover (such as an electric motor or internal combustion engine) that converts mechanical energy into fluid energy, Pressurized fluid is controlled and directed by valves into an actuator device such as a [[hydraulic cylinder]] or [[pneumatic cylinder]], to provide linear motion, or a [[hydraulic motor]] or [[pneumatic motor]], to provide rotary motion or [[torque]]. Rotary motion may be continuous or confined to less than one revolution.

==Hydraulic pumps==
'''Dynamic (non positive displacement) Pumps'''

This type is generally used for low-pressure, high volume flow applications. Since they are not capable of withstanding high pressures, there is little use in the fluid power field. Their maximum pressure is limited to 250-300 psi. This type of pump is primarily used for transporting fluids from one location to another. Centrifugal and axial flow propeller pumps are the two most common types of dynamic pumps.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, Anthony, ''Fluid Power With Applications'',{{ISBN|0-13-513690-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Positive Displacement Pumps'''
This type is universally used for fluid power systems. With this pump, a fixed amount of fluid is ejected into the hydraulic system per revolution of pump shaft rotation. These pumps are capable of overcoming the pressure resulting from the mechanical loads on the system as well as the resistance to flow due to friction. These  two features are highly desirable in fluid power pumps. These pumps also have the following advantages over non positive displacement pumps:
*High-pressure capability(up to 12,000 psi)
*Small compact size
*high volumetric efficiency 
*small changes in efficiency throughout the design pressure range&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, Anthony, ''Fluid Power With Applications'',{{ISBN|0-13-513690-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics ==
Fluid power systems can produce high power and high forces in small volumes, compared with electrically-driven systems. The forces that are exerted can be easily monitored within a system by gauges and meters. In comparison to systems that provide force through electricity or fuel, fluid power systems are known to have long service lives if maintained properly. The working fluid passing through a fluid motor inherently provides cooling of the motor, which must be separately arranged for an electric motor.  Fluid motors normally produce no sparks, which are a source of ignition or explosions in [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|hazardous areas]] containing flammable gases or vapors. 

Fluid power systems are susceptible to pressure and flow losses within pipes and control devices. Fluid power systems are equipped with filters and other measures to preserve the cleanliness of the working fluid.  Any dirt in the system can cause wear of seals and leakage, or can obstruct control valves and cause erratic operation. The hydraulic fluid itself is sensitive to temperature and pressure along with being somewhat compressible. These can cause systems to not run properly. If not run properly, [[cavitation]] and [[aeration]] can occur.

==Application==
Mobile applications of fluid power are widespread.  Nearly every self-propelled wheeled vehicle has either hydraulically-operated or [[Air brake (road vehicle)|pneumatically-operated]] [[brake]]s.  Earthmoving equipment such as [[bulldozer]]s, [[backhoe]]s and others use powerful hydraulic systems for digging and also for propulsion. A very compact fluid power system is the [[automatic transmission]] found in many vehicles, which includes a hydraulic [[torque converter]]. 

Fluid power is also used in automated systems, where tools or work pieces are moved or held  using fluid power. Variable-flow control valves and position sensors may be included in a [[servomechanism]] system for precision machine tools. Below is a more detailed list of applications and categories that fluid power is used for:

*Industrial (also known as fixed)
::*metalworking
::*injection molding
::*controllers
::*material handling
*Aerospace
::*landing gears
::*brakes

==Pneumatic and hydraulic systems compared==
*'''Cost''': Pneumatics are  less expensive to build and operate.  Air is used as the compressed medium, so there is no requirement to drain or recover fluid. Hydraulic systems use larger working pressures, and require larger parts than pneumatics.
*'''Precision''': Unlike liquids, gases change volume significantly when pressurized making it difficult to achieve precision.

==Common Hydraulic Circuit Application==

===Synchronizing ===

This circuit works off of synchronization. As a cylinder reaches a certain point another will be activated, either by a hydraulic limit switch valve or by the build-up of pressure in the cylinder.  These circuits are used in  manufacturing. An example of this would be on an assembly line. As a hydraulic arm is activated to grab an object. It then will reach a point of extension or retraction, where the other cylinder is activated to screw a cap or top onto the object. Hence the term Synchronizing.

===Regenerative ===

In a regenerative circuit, a double acting cylinder is used. This cylinder has a pump that has a fixed output. The use of a regenerative circuit permits use of a smaller size pump for any given application. This works by re-routing the fluid to the cap instead of back to the tank &lt;ref name="Hydraulics &amp; Pnuematics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regeneration Circuits|url=http://www.hydraulicspneumatics.com/other-technologies/book-2-chapter-17-regeneration-circuits|publisher=Hydraulics &amp; Pnuematics|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=November 2017}}.  For example, in a drilling process a regenerative circuit will allow drilling at a consistent speed, and retraction at a much faster speed. This gives the operator a faster and more precise production. {{cn|date=November 2017}}

==Electrical control==
Combinations of electrical control of fluid power elements are widespread in automated systems.  A wide variety of measuring, sensing, or control elements are available in electrical form.  These can be used to operate [[solenoid valve]]s or [[servo valve]]s that control the fluid power element.  Electrical control may be used to allow, for example, remote control of a fluid power system without running long control lines to a remotely located manual control valve.

[[File:Latarnia gazowa przyMoscieTumskim.jpg|thumb|upright|Gas lighting in the historical center of [[Wrocław, Poland]] is manually turned off and on daily.]]

'''Gas lighting''' is production of artificial light from [[combustion]] of a gaseous fuel, such as [[hydrogen]], [[methane]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[propane]], [[butane]], [[acetylene]], [[ethylene]], or [[natural gas]].

The light is produced either directly by the flame, generally by using special mixes of [[illuminating gas]] to increase brightness, or indirectly with other components such as the [[gas mantle]] or the [[limelight]], with the gas primarily functioning as a fuel source.

Before [[electricity]] became sufficiently widespread and economical to allow for general public use, gas was the most popular method of outdoor and indoor lighting in [[cities]] and [[suburb]]s. Early gas lights were ignited manually, but many later designs are self-igniting.

Gas lighting today is generally used for [[camping]], where the high [[energy density]] of a [[hydrocarbon fuel]], combined with the modular nature of canisters (a strong metal container) allows bright and long lasting light to be produced cheaply and without complex equipment.  In addition, some urban historical districts retain gas [[street lighting]], and gas lighting is used indoors or outdoors to create or preserve a nostalgic effect.

==Background==
[[File:Eclairage.jpg|thumb|An overview of lighting technology, circa 1900]]

Early lighting fuels consisted of [[olive oil]], [[beeswax]], [[fish oil]], [[whale oil]], [[sesame oil]], nut oil, and similar substances. These were the most commonly used fuels until the late 18th century. Chinese records dating back 1,700 years note the use of natural gas in the home for light and heat via [[bamboo]] pipes to the dwellings.&lt;ref&gt;P. James and N. Thorpe, ''Ancient inventions'' (Michael O Mara Books, 1995), pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=VmJLd3sSYecC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PA427 427]-428: citing [[Chang Qu|Ch'ang Ch'ü]] (常璩, a geographer), ''[[Chronicles of Huayang|Records of the country south of Mount Kua]]'' (華陽國志).&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Chinese of the Spring and Autumn period made the first practical use of natural gas for lighting purposes around 500 B.C. where they used bamboo pipelines to transport and carry both brine and natural gas for many miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Encyclopedia of Environment and Society |last= Robbins |first= Paul  |year=2007 |publisher=Sage Publications|page=1216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Powering Our Future: An Energy Sourcebook for Sustainable Living |last=Smith |first=Kimberly |publisher=Iuniverse Inc. |year=2005 |publication-date=May 31, 2005 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Power Plays: Energy Options in the Age of Peak Oil |last=Rapier |first=Robert |date=March 30, 2012 |publisher=Apress  |isbn=978-1430240860 |publication-date=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Investing in Oil and Gas: The ABC's of DPPs (Direct Participation Program)  |last=Heshelow |first=Kathy |publisher=Iuniverse Inc |year=2008 |isbn=978-0595531929 |publication-date=September 2, 2008 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A People's History of Science: Miners, Midwives, and Low Mechanicks |last=Conner |first=Clifford |publisher=Nation Books |year=2005 |isbn=978-1560257486 |publication-date=November 8, 2005 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public illumination preceded the discovery and adoption of gaslight by centuries. In 1417, Sir [[Henry Barton]], [[Lord Mayor of London]], ordained "lanterns with lights to be hung out on the winter evenings between [[All Saints' Day|Hallowtide]] and [[Candlemas]]se." [[Paris]] was first lit by an order issued in 1524, and, in the beginning of the 16th century, the inhabitants were ordered to keep lights burning in the windows of all houses that faced the streets. In 1668, when some regulations were made for improving the streets of London, the residents were reminded to hang out their [[lantern]]s at the usual time, and, in 1690, an order was issued to hang out a light, or lamp, every night as soon as it was dark, from [[Michaelmas]] to [[Christmas]]. By an Act of the [[Corporation of London|Common Council]] in 1716, all housekeepers, whose houses faced any street, lane, or passage, were required to hang out, every dark night, one or more lights, to burn from six to eleven o'clock, under the penalty of one [[shilling]] as a fine for failing to do so.

In [[coal mining]], accumulating and escaping gases were known originally for their adverse effects rather than their useful qualities. [[Coal]] miners described two types of gases, one called the ''[[choke damp]]'' and the other ''[[fire damp]]''. In 1667, a paper detailing the effects of these gases was entitled, "A Description of a Well and Earth in Lancashire taking Fire, by a Candle approaching to it. Imparted by Thomas Shirley, Esq an eye-witness."

[[Stephen Hales]] was the first person who procured a flammable fluid from the actual distillation of coal. His experiments with this object are related in the first volume of his ''Vegetable Statics'', published in 1726. From the distillation of "one hundred and fifty-eight [[Grain (unit)|grains]] [10.2 g] of Newcastle coal, he states that he obtained one hundred and eighty cubic inches [2.9 L] of air, which weighed fifty-one grains [3.3 g], being nearly one third of the whole." These results seemed to have passed without notice for several years.

In the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' in 1733, some properties of [[coal-gas]] are detailed in a paper called, "An Account of the Damp Air in a Coal-pit of [[Sir James Lowther, 4th Baronet|Sir James Lowther]], sunk within Twenty Yards of the Sea." This paper contained some striking facts relating to the flammability and other properties of coal-gas.

The principal properties of coal-gas were demonstrated to different members of the [[Royal Society]], and showed that after keeping the gas some time, it still retained its  flammability.  The scientists of the time still saw no useful purpose for it.

[[John Clayton (reverend and scientist)|John Clayton]], in an extract from a letter in the ''Philosophical Transactions'' for 1735, calls gas the "spirit" of coal and discovered its flammability by an accident. This "spirit" happened to catch fire, by coming in contact with a candle as it escaped from a fracture in one of his distillatory vessels. By preserving the gas in bladders, he entertained his friends, by exhibiting its flammability.

[[File:Blessed effects of gas lights (1814).png|thumb|upright|Satirical cartoon showing dangers of early gaslighting (London, 1813)]]

[[William Murdoch]] (sometimes spelled "Murdock") was the first to exploit the flammability of gas for the practical application of lighting. He worked for [[Matthew Boulton]] and [[James Watt]] at their [[Soho Foundry]] [[steam engine]] works in [[Birmingham]], England. In the early 1790s, while overseeing the use of his company's steam engines in tin mining in Cornwall, Murdoch began experimenting with various types of gas, finally settling on coal-gas as the most effective. He first lit his own house in [[Redruth]], [[Cornwall]] in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Thomson; ''The Scot Who Lit The World, The Story Of William Murdoch Inventor Of Gas Lighting''; 2003; {{ISBN|0-9530013-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1798, he used gas to light the main building of the Soho Foundry and in 1802 lit the outside in a public display of gas lighting, the lights astonishing the local population. One of the employees at the Soho Foundry, [[Samuel Clegg]], saw the potential of this new form of lighting. Clegg left his job to set up his own gas lighting business, the Gas Lighting and [[Coke (fuel)|Coke]] Company.

A "thermolampe" using [[Wood gas|gas distilled from wood]] was patented in 1799, whilst German inventor Friedrich Winzer ([[Frederick Albert Winsor]]) was the first person to patent coal-gas lighting in 1804.

In 1801, Phillipe Lebon of [[Paris]] had also used gas lights to illuminate his house and gardens, and was considering how to light all of Paris. In 1820, Paris adopted gas street lighting.

In 1804, Dr. Henry delivered a course of lectures on [[chemistry]], at [[Manchester]], in which he showed the mode of producing gas from coal, and the facility and advantage of its use. Dr. Henry analyzed the composition and investigated the properties of carburetted hydrogen gas. His experiments were numerous and accurate and made upon a variety of substances; having obtained the gas from wood, [[peat]], different kinds of coal, oil, wax, &amp;c. he quantified the intensity of the light from each source.

[[Josiah Pemberton]], an inventor, had for some time been experimenting on the nature of gas. A resident of [[Birmingham]], his attention may have been roused by the exhibition at Soho. About 1806, he exhibited gas-lights in a variety of forms and with great brilliance at the front of his manufactory in Birmingham. In 1808 he constructed an apparatus, applicable to several uses, for [[Benjamin Cooke]], a manufacturer of [[brass]] tubes, [[Gilding|gilt]] toys, and other articles.

In 1808, Murdoch presented to [[the Royal Society]] a paper entitled "Account of the Application of Gas from Coal to Economical Purposes" wherein he described his successful application of coal-gas to lighting the extensive establishment of Messrs. Phillips and Lea. For this paper he was awarded Count Rumford's gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=1748|title=- Royal Society|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murdoch's statements threw great light on the comparative advantage of gas and candles and contained much useful information on the expenses of production and management.

The first well-recorded public street lighting with gas was demonstrated in [[Pall Mall, London]], on January 28, 1807, by [[Frederick Albert Winsor]].&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Freeman |first=Laura |title=The most magical job in Britain: Enchanting story of our last gas street lights, and the five men who keep them burning just as they did in Dickens' day |date=2014-11-24 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2848038/The-magical-job-Britain-Enchanting-story-gas-street-lights-five-men-burning-just-did-Dickens-day.html |access-date=2014-02-15 |newspaper=Daily Mail |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150204064345/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2848038/The-magical-job-Britain-Enchanting-story-gas-street-lights-five-men-burning-just-did-Dickens-day.html |archivedate=February 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1812, [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] granted a charter to the London and Westminster [[Gas Light and Coke Company]], and the first gas company in the world came into being. Less than two years later, on December 31, 1813, the [[Westminster Bridge]] was lit by gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy |first=Maev |title=Light brigade: carrying the torch for London's last gas street lamps |date=2015-12-25 |url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/dec/25/londons-last-gas-street-lamps |newspaper=The Guardian |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225124433/http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/dec/25/londons-last-gas-street-lamps |archivedate=December 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As artificial lighting became more common, desire grew for it to become readily available to the public. This was in part because towns became much safer places to travel around after gas lamps were installed in the streets, reducing crime rates.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} In 1809, accordingly, the first application was made to Parliament to incorporate a company in order to accelerate the process, but failed to pass. In 1810, however, the application was renewed by the same parties, and though some opposition was encountered and considerable expense incurred, the bill passed, but not without great alterations; and the London and Westminster Chartered Gas-Light and Coke Company was established. By 1816, Samuel Clegg obtained the patent for his horizontal rotative [[retort]], his apparatus for purifying coal-gas with [[cream of lime]], and for his rotative [[gas meter]] and self-acting [[Governor (device)|governor]].

Among the economic impacts of gas lighting was much longer work hours in factories. This was particularly important in Great Britain during the winter months when nights are significantly longer. Factories could even work continuously over 24 hours, resulting in increased production. Following successful commercialization, gas lighting spread to other countries.

In England, the first place outside London to have gas lighting was [[Preston, Lancashire]], in 1816; this was due to the Preston Gaslight Company run by revolutionary [[Joseph Dunn (revolutionary)|Joseph Dunn]], who found the most improved way of brighter gas lighting.  The parish church there was the first religious building to be lit by gas lighting. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewitson|first=Anthony|title=History (from A.D. 705 to 1883) of Preston in the County of Lancaster|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0JgwAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA268|page=268|year=1883|publisher=Chronicle Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, [[Seth Bemis]] lit his factory with gas illumination from 1812 to 1813. The use of gas lights in [[Rembrandt Peale]]'s Museum in [[Baltimore]] in 1816 was a great success. Baltimore was the first American city with gas streetlights; Peale's Gas Light Company of Baltimore on February 7, 1817 lit its first street lamp at Market and Lemon Streets (currently Baltimore and Holliday Streets). The first private residence in the US illuminated by gas has been variously identified as that of [[David Melville (inventor)|David Melville]] (c. 1806), as described above, or of William Henry, a [[coppersmith]], at 200 Lombard Street, [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], in 1816.

The history of the Russian gas industry began with retired Lieutenant Pyotr Sobolevsky (1782–1841), who improved [[Philippe le Bon]]'s design for a "thermolamp" and presented it to Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] in 1811; in January 1812, Sobolevsky was instructed to draw up a plan for gas street-lighting for St. Petersburg. The [[French invasion of Russia]] delayed implementation, but St. Petersburg's Governor General [[Mikhail Miloradovich]], who had seen the gas lighting of Vienna, Paris and other European cities, initiated experimental work on gas lighting for the capital, using British apparatus for obtaining gas from pit coal, and by the autumn of 1819, Russia's first gas street light was lit on one of the streets on [[Aptekarsky Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yefimov |first=Alexander |title=Pioneers of the Methane Age |url=http://www.oilru.com/or/23/389/ |journal=Oil of Russia:International Quarterly Edition |issue=2005-02 |access-date=2005-12-22 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222232429/http://www.oilru.com/or/23/389/ |archivedate=December 22, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1835, the Company for Gas Lighting St. Petersburg was founded; towards the end of that year, a factory for the production of lighting gas was constructed near the [[Obvodny Canal]], using pit coal brought in by ship from [[Cardiff]]; and, on September 27, 1839, 204 gas lamps were ceremonially lit in St. Petersburg.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Over the next 10 years, their numbers almost quadrupled, to reach 800. By the middle of the 19th century, the central streets and buildings of the capital were illuminated: the [[Palace Square]], Bolshaya and Malaya Morskaya streets, [[Nevsky Prospect|Nevsky]] and Tsarskoselsky Avenues, [[Passage (department store)|Passage]] Arcade, Noblemen's Assembly, the [[Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology|Technical Institute]] and [[Peter and Paul Fortress]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Yefimov and Lyudmila Volkova, "[http://www.oilru.com/or/23/389/ Pioneers of the Methane Age] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222232429/http://www.oilru.com/or/23/389/ |date=December 22, 2005 }}," ''Oil of Russia'', No. 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1817, at the three stations of the Chartered Gas Company, 25 [[chaldron]]s (24 m³) of coal were [[Carbonization|carbonized]] daily, producing 300,000 cubic feet (8,500 m³) of gas. This supplied gas lamps equal to 75,000 [[Argand lamp]]s each yielding the light of six candles. At the City Gas Works, in Dorset Street, [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], three chaldrons of coal were carbonized each day, providing the gas equivalent of 9,000 Argand lamps. So 28 chaldrons of coal were carbonized daily, and 84,000 lights supplied by those two companies only.

At this period the principal difficulty in gas manufacture was purification. Mr. D. Wilson, of Dublin, [[patent]]ed a method for purifying coal-gas by means of the chemical action of [[ammoniacal]] gas. Another plan was devised by Mr. Reuben Phillips, of [[Exeter]], who patented the purification of coal-gas by the use of dry [[Lime (material)|lime]]. Mr. G. Holworthy, in 1818, patented a method of purifying it by causing the gas, in a highly condensed state, to pass through iron retorts heated to a dark red.

By 1823, numerous towns and cities throughout Britain were lit by gas. Gaslight cost up to 75% less than [[oil lamp]]s or candles, which helped to accelerate its development and deployment. By 1859, gas lighting was to be found all over Britain and about a thousand [[gas works]] had sprung up to meet the demand for the new fuel. The brighter lighting which gas provided allowed people to read more easily and for longer. This helped to stimulate literacy and learning, speeding up the second [[Industrial Revolution]].

[[Oil-gas]] appeared in the field as a rival of coal-gas. In 1815, [[John Taylor (civil engineer)|John Taylor]] patented an apparatus for the decomposition of "oil" and other animal substances. Public attention was attracted to "oil-gas" by the display of the patent apparatus at [[Apothecary's Hall]], by [[Taylor &amp; Martineau]].

In 1891 the [[gas mantle]] was invented by the [[Austrians|Austrian]] chemist [[Carl Auer von Welsbach]]. This eliminated the need for special illuminating gas – a synthetic mixture of [[hydrogen]] and [[hydrocarbon]] gases produced by [[destructive distillation]] of [[bituminous coal]] or [[peat]], to get bright shining flames. [[Acetylene]] was also used from about 1898 for gas lighting on a smaller scale.&lt;ref name=CGA100&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cganet.com/docs/100th.pdf|publisher=www.cganet.com|date=11 September 2013|title=Celebrating 100 Years as The Standard for Safety: The Compressed Gas Association, Inc. 1913 – 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illuminating gas was used for gas lighting, as it produces a much brighter light than [[natural gas]] or [[water gas]]. Illuminating gas was much less toxic than other forms of coal-gas, but less could be produced from a given quantity of coal. The experiments with distilling coal were described by John Clayton in 1684. George Dixon's pilot plant exploded in 1760, setting back the production of illuminating gas a few years. The first commercial application was in a [[Manchester]] [[cotton mill]] in 1806. In 1901, studies of the [[defoliant]] effect of leaking [[gas pipe]]s led to the discovery that ethylene is a [[plant hormone]].

Throughout the 19th century and into the first decades of the 20th, the gas was manufactured by the [[gasification]] of coal. In the latter years of the nineteenth century, natural gas began to replace coal-gas, first in the US, and then in other parts of the world. In the United Kingdom, coal-gas was used until the early 1970s.

== Theatrical use ==

It took many years of development and testing before gas lighting for the stage would be commercially available for use in theatres. Gas technology would then be installed in just about every major theatre in the world. However, lighting with means of gas would be short lived because the invention of the electric light bulb would be soon to follow.

It would take close to two hundred years for gas to become accessible for commercial use. A Flemish alchemist, [[Jan Baptista van Helmont]], was the first person to formally recognize gas as a state of matter. He would go on to identify several types of gases, including carbon dioxide. Over one hundred years later in 1733, Sir [[Sir James Lowther, 4th Baronet|James Lowther]] had some of his miners working on a water pit for his mine. While digging the pit they hit a pocket of gas. Lowther took a sample of the gas and took it home to do some experiments. He noted,  "The said air being put into a bladder … and tied close, may be carried away, and kept some days, and being afterwards pressed gently through a small pipe into the flame of a candle, will take fire, and burn at the end of the pipe as long as the bladder is gently pressed to feed the flame, and when taken from the candle after it is so lighted, it will continue burning till there is no more air left in the bladder to supply the flame."&lt;ref&gt;Penzel 28&lt;/ref&gt; Lowther had basically discovered the principle behind gas lighting.

Later in the eighteenth Century [[William Murdoch]] would state: "the gas obtained by distillation from coal, peat, wood and other inflammable substances burnt with great brilliancy upon being set fire to … by conducting it through tubes, it might be employed as an economical substitute for lamps and candles."&lt;ref&gt;Penzel 29&lt;/ref&gt; Murdoch’s first invention was a lantern with a gas-filled bladder attached to a jet. He would use this to walk home at night. After seeing how well this worked he decided to light his home with gas. In 1797, Murdoch would install gas lighting into his new home as well as the workshop in which he worked. “This work was of a large scale, and he next experimented to find better ways of producing, purifying, and burning the gas.”&lt;ref&gt;Penzel 30&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation had been laid for companies to start producing gas and other inventors to start playing with ways of using the new technology. This new technology would quickly find its way to the stage.

In the 19th century, gas stage lighting would go from a crude experiment to the most popular way of lighting theatrical stages. In 1804, Frederick Albert Winsor, a German, first demonstrated the way to use gas to light the stage in London at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]]. Although the demonstration and all the lead research were being done in London, “in 1816 at the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia was the earliest gas lit theatre in world”.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson,362&lt;/ref&gt; In 1817 the Lyceum, [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]], and Covent Garden theatres were all lit by gas. Gas would be brought into the building by "Miles of rubber tubing from outlets in the floor called 'water joints' carried the gas to border-lights and wing lights". But before it was distributed, the gas came through a central distribution point called a “gas table”.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Sellman 15&lt;/ref&gt;
The gas table was how the brightness could be "varied by regulating the gas supply, and the gas table, which allowed control of separate parts of the stage, became the first stage 'switchboard'".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Pilbrow 174&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1850s, gas lighting in theatres had spread practically all over the United States and Europe. Some of the largest installations of gas lighting would be in large auditoriums, like the [[Theatre de Chatelet]], built in 1862.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Penzel 69&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875, the new [[Paris Opera]] was constructed. “Its lighting system contained more than twenty-eight miles [{{convert|28|mi|disp=out}}] of gas piping, and its gas table had no fewer than eighty-eight stopcocks, which controlled nine hundred and sixty gas jets.”&lt;ref&gt;Penzel 69&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre that used the most gas lighting was the Astley’s Equestrian Amphitheatre in London. According to the Illustrated London News “Everywhere white and gold meets the eye, and about 200,000 gas jets add to the glittering effect of the auditorium … such a blaze of light and splendour has scarcely ever been witnessed, even in dreams.”&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Theatres were switching over to gas lighting not just because it was more economical than using candles but also required less labor to operate. With gas lighting, theatres would no longer need to have people tending to candles during a performance, or having to light each candle individually. “It was easier to light a row of gas jets than a greater quantity of candles high in the air.”&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Theatres also no longer needed to worry about wax dripping on the actors during a show.

Gas lighting also had an effect on the actors. The actors now could use less make-up and their motions did not have to be as exaggerated. The reasoning for this was because the stage was now brighter than it had ever been before. What had once been on half-lit stages was now on in fully lit stages. Production companies were so impressed with the new technology that some would go as far to say, “This light is perfect for the stage. One can obtain gradation of brightness that is really magical.”&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The best thing that happened due to this change was the respect from the audience. There was no more shouting or riots. The light pushed the actors more up stage behind the proscenium helping the audience concentrate more on the action that was taking place on stage rather than what was going on in the house. Management had more authority on what went on during the show because they could see.&lt;ref&gt;Penzel 54&lt;/ref&gt; Gaslight was the leading cause of behavior change in theaters. It was no longer a place for mingling and orange selling; it was now a place of respected entertainment.

There were six types of burners but four burners were really experimented with. The first burner used with this system was the single-jet burner that produced a small flame. The tip of the burner was made out of lead which absorbed heat causing the flame to be smaller in size. It was discovered that the flame would burn brighter if straight metal was mixed with other components, such as porcelain. Flat burners were invented mainly to evenly distribute gas and light to the systems. The fishtail burner is a relative to the flat burner but it managed to create a brighter flame and conducted less heat. The last burner that was experimented with was the [[Welsbach burner]]. Around this time the [[Bunsen burner]] was in use along with some forms of electricity. The Welsbach was based on the idea of the Bunsen burner, still using gas, a cotton mesh with [[cerium]] and [[thorium]] was imbedded into the Welsbach. This source of light was named the “[[gas mantle]]” which created three times more light than the naked flame.&lt;ref&gt;Penzel 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Instruments that were used to light the stage during the nineteenth century fell under different classifications. Footlights, border lights, groundrows, lengths, bunch lights, conical reflector floods, and limelight spots were mainly used during this period. These mechanisms sat directly on the stage blinding the eyesight of the audience. Footlights caused the actors’ costumes to catch fire if they got too close to the lights. These lights also caused bothersome heat that affected both audience members and actors. Again, the actors had to adapt to these changes. They started fireproofing their costumes and placing wire mesh in front of the footlights.

Border lights, also known as striplights, were a row of lights that hung horizontally in the flies. Color was added later by dying cotton, wool, and silk cloth. Lengths were constructed the same way as the border light, only these lights were mounted vertically in the rear where the wings were. Bunch lights are a cluster of burners that sat on a vertical base that was fueled directly from the gas line. The conical reflector can be related to [[Fresnel lens|Fresnels]] that are currently used today. This adjustable box of light reflected a beam in which the size could be altered by a barndoor. Limelight spots are similar to today’s current spotlighting system. This instrument was used in scene shops, as well as the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Penzel 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Gas lighting did have some disadvantages. "Several hundred theatres are said to have burned down in America and Europe between 1800 and the introduction of electricity in the late 1800s. The increased heat was objectionable, and the border lights and wing lights had to be lighted by a long stick with a flaming wad of cotton at the end. For many years, an attendant or gas boy moved along the long row of jets, lighting them individually while gas was escaping from the whole row. Both actors and audiences complained of the escaping gas, and explosions sometimes resulted from its accumulation."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

These problems with gas lighting led to the rapid adoption of electric lighting. By 1881, the Savoy Theatre in London was using incandescent lighting.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 364&lt;/ref&gt; As electric lighting was being introduced to theatre stages, people who still were using gas theatre lighting developed the [[gas mantle]] in 1885. “This was a beehive-shaped mesh of knitted thread impregnated with lime that, in miniature, converted the naked gas flame into in effect, a lime-light.”&lt;ref&gt;Baugh, 24&lt;/ref&gt; Electric lighting would slowly take over theatre lighting. In the twentieth century, electric lighting would lead to even better and safer theater productions. These productions would be comfortable to watch with no smell, relatively very little heat, and more freedom for designers.

In the early 20th century, most cities in North America and Europe had gaslit streets. However, around 1880 gas lighting for streets began giving way to high voltage (3000–6000 volt) [[direct current]] and [[alternating current]] [[Arc lamp|arc lighting]] systems. This time period also saw the development of the first electric power utility designed for indoor use. The new system by inventor [[Thomas Edison]] was designed to function similar to gas lighting. For reasons of safety and simplicity it used [[direct current]] (DC) at a relatively low 110 volts to light [[incandescent light bulb]]s. Voltage in wires steadily declines as distance increases, and at this low voltage power plants needed to be within about {{convert|1|mi|km}} of the lamps. This [[voltage drop]] problem made DC distribution relatively expensive and gas lighting retained widespread usage&lt;ref name="westinghouse"&gt;''A bit of Engineering History: The story of the fuel gas and electrical engineering company'', by A. M. Gow, pp 181-183, The Electric Journal, Volume 14, Copyright 1917, The Westinghouse Club https://books.google.com/books?id=CjAyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA181&lt;/ref&gt; with new buildings sometimes constructed with dual systems of gas piping and electrical wiring connected to each room, to diversify the power sources for lighting.

The development of new [[alternating current]] power transmission systems in the 1880s and 90s by companies such as [[Ganz Works|Ganz]] and [[AEG]] in Europe and [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] and [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company|Thomson-Houston]] in the US solved the voltage and distance problem by using high [[transmission line]] voltages, and [[transformer]]s to drop the voltage for distribution for indoor lighting. Alternating current technology overcame many of the limitations of direct current, enabling the rapid growth of reliable, low-cost [[electrical power]] networks which finally spelled the end of widespread usage of gas lighting.&lt;ref name="westinghouse" /&gt;

== Modern outdoor usage ==
[[File:MAR 05 326 Gaslight.jpg|thumb|upright|Modern gas street light in [[Berlin, Germany]] (2005)]]

In the 20th century, most cities with gas streetlights replaced them with new electric streetlights. For example, Baltimore, the first US city to install gas streetlights, removed nearly all of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rasmussen|first=Frederick|title=City's gaslight glow dimmed in 1957 Progress: The American gas industry was born in Baltimore in 1816, when an artist wanted a clean, smoke-free way to illuminate a roomful of paintings|date=1998-10-10|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-10-10/features/1998283099_1_gas-lamps-gas-light-american-gas|access-date=2013-06-22|newspaper=Baltimore Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sole, token gas lamp is located at N. Holliday Street and E. Baltimore Street as a monument to the first gas lamp in America, erected at that location.

However, gas lighting of streets has not disappeared completely from some cities, and the few municipalities that retained gas lighting now find that it provides a pleasing nostalgic effect. Gas lighting is also seeing a resurgence in the [[Luxury real estate|luxury home]] market for those in search of historical authenticity.

The largest gas lighting network in the world is that of [[Berlin]]. With about 37,000 lamps (2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berlins Gaslight Culture association |url=http://www.gaslicht-kultur.de/|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it holds more than half of all working gas street lamps in the world. In central [[London]] around 1500 gas lamps still operate,&lt;ref name = "Freeman"/&gt; lighting the [[Royal Parks]], the exterior of [[Buckingham Palace]] and almost the entire [[Covent Garden]] area. [[The Park Estate]] in [[Nottingham]] retains much of its original character, including the original gas lighting network.

In the [[United States]], more than 2800 gas lights in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] operate in the [[historic district (United States)|historic districts]] of [[Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Beacon Hill]], [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]], [[Bay Village, Boston|Bay Village]], [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]], and parts of other neighborhoods. In [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], more than [[Cincinnati Street Gas Lamps|1100 gas lights]] operate in areas that have been named historic districts. Gas lights also operate in parts of the famed [[French Quarter]] and outside historic homes throughout the city in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].

[[South Orange, New Jersey]], has adopted the gaslight as the symbol of the town, and uses them on nearly all streets. Several other towns in [[New Jersey]] also retain gas lighting: [[Glen Ridge, New Jersey|Glen Ridge]], [[Palmyra, New Jersey|Palmyra]], [[Riverton, New Jersey|Riverton]], and some parts of [[Orange, New Jersey|Orange]], [[Cape May, New Jersey|Cape May]] and Cherry Hill. The village of [[Riverside, Illinois]], still uses its original gas street lights that are an original feature of the  [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] planned community. [[Manhattan Beach, California]], has a gas lamp section in which all the sidewalks are lit by public gas lamps. [[Disneyland]] has authentic 19th century gas lamps from Baltimore along the "[[Main Street, U.S.A.]]" section of the [[theme park]].

Many gas utility companies will still quote a fixed periodic rate for a customer-maintained gas lamp, and some homeowners still use such devices. However, the high cost of natural gas lighting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arencambre.com/blog/2005/10/29/gas-lamps-are-expensive/|title=Gas Lamps are Expensive – Aren Cambre's Blog|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least partly explains why a large number of older gas lamps have been converted to electricity. Solar-rechargeable battery-powered gas light controllers can be easily retrofitted into existing gas lamps to keep the lights off during daylight hours and cut energy consumption and green-house gas carbon emissions by 50%.

== Modern indoor usage ==
[[File:Interior Gas Lighting, 3 Light Swan neck bracket.jpg|thumb|upright|A three mantle gas lamp in modern use]]

The use of natural gas (methane) for ''indoor'' lighting is nearly extinct. Besides producing a lot of heat, the combustion of methane tends to release significant amounts of [[carbon monoxide]], a colorless and odorless gas which is more readily absorbed by the blood than [[oxygen]], and can be deadly. Historically, the use of lamps of all types was of shorter duration than we are accustomed to with electric lights, and in the far more draughty buildings, it was of less concern and danger. There are no suppliers of new mantle gas lamps set up for use with natural gas; however, some old homes still have fixtures installed, and some period restorations have salvaged fixtures installed, more for decoration than use.

New fixtures are still made and available for [[propane]] (sometimes called "bottle(d) gas"), a product of [[oil refining]], which under most circumstances burns more completely to [[carbon dioxide]] and water vapor. In some locations where [[power grid|public utility electricity]] or [[kerosene]] are not readily accessible or desirable, propane [[gas mantle]] lamps are still used, although the increased availability  of alternative energy sources, such as [[Photovoltaic module|solar panels]] and small scale [[wind generators]], combined with increasing efficiency of lighting products, such as [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s and [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] are also in use. For occasional use in remote cabins and cottages, propane mantle lamps may still be more economical and less labor-intensive than an [[alternative energy]] system.

== Other uses ==
Perforated tubes bent into the shape of letters were used to form gas lit advertising signs, prior to the introduction of [[Neon lighting|neon lights]], as early as 1857 in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historygrandrapids.org/explore.php?cat=6&amp;essay=14|title=Lighting City Streets, 1850s to 1950s|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=May 30, 2007|work=Grand Rapids History|publisher=Grand Rapids Historical Commission|accessdate=5 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124050202/http://historygrandrapids.org/explore.php?cat=6&amp;essay=14|archivedate=24 November 2010|df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Gas lighting is still in common use for [[camping]] lights. Small portable gas lamps, connected to a portable gas cylinder, are a common item on camping trips. Mantle lamps powered by vaporized petrol, such as the [[Coleman lantern]], are also available.

[[File:Heliograph-2.jpg|thumb|right|Fig. 1: Signaling with a Mance heliograph, 1910]]

A '''heliograph''' (''[[helios]]'' ({{Lang-el|ἥλιος}}), meaning "sun", and ''[[wikt:-graphy|graphein]]'' ({{Lang|el|γράφειν}}), meaning "write") is a wireless [[telegraph]] that signals by flashes of [[sunlight]] (generally using [[Morse code]]) reflected by a [[mirror]]. The flashes are produced by momentarily pivoting the mirror, or by interrupting the beam with a shutter.&lt;ref name=Woods2008/&gt; The heliograph was a simple but effective instrument for instantaneous [[optical communication]] over long distances during the late 19th and early [[20th century]].&lt;ref name=Woods2008/&gt; Its main uses were military, survey and forest protection work. Heliographs were standard issue in the British and Australian armies until the 1960s, and were used by the Pakistani army as late as 1975.&lt;ref name="Boer"/&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:Heliograph (1)-2.jpg|thumb|Fig. 2: German heliograph made by R. Fuess in Berlin (on display at the Museum of Communication in Frankfurt)]]
There were many heliograph types.  Most heliographs were variants of the British Army Mance Mark V version (Fig.1). It used a mirror with a small unsilvered spot in the centre. The sender aligned the heliograph to the target by looking at the reflected target in the mirror and moving their head until the target was hidden by the unsilvered spot. Keeping their head still, they then adjusted the aiming rod so its cross wires bisected the target.&lt;ref name=Manual1922&gt;{{cite book|title=Signal Training|volume=III. Pamphlet No. 2. Heliograph, 5-inch, Mark V. 1922.|year=1922|publisher=His Majesty's Stationery Office|location=London|pages=10–13|url=http://www.royalsignals.org.uk/signals.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then turned up the sighting vane, which covered the cross wires with a diagram of a cross, and aligned the mirror with the tangent and elevation screws so the small shadow that was the reflection of the unsilvered spot hole was on the cross target.&lt;ref name=Manual1922 /&gt;  This indicated that the sunbeam was pointing at the target. 
The flashes were produced by a keying mechanism that tilted the mirror up a few degrees at the push of a lever at the back of the instrument. If the sun was in front of the sender, its rays were reflected directly from this mirror to the receiving station.  If the sun was behind the sender, the sighting rod was replaced by a second mirror, to capture the sunlight from the main mirror and reflect it to the receiving station.&lt;ref name="Forestry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="British"&gt;[http://www.smecc.org/heliograph_-_signaling_by_the_sun.htm Manual Of Instruction In Army Signaling  1886 Section III- Apparatus And Method Of Using It].

The heliograph had some great advantages. It allowed long distance communication without a fixed infrastructure, though it could also be linked to make a fixed network extending for hundreds of miles, as in the fort-to-fort network used for the [[Geronimo]] campaign. It was very portable, did not require any power source, and was relatively secure since it was invisible to those not near the axis of operation, and the beam was very narrow, spreading only 50 feet per mile of range. However, anyone in the beam with the correct knowledge could intercept signals without being detected.&lt;ref name="Boer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kipling"&gt;Kipling, Rudyard [http://www.kipling.org.uk/poems_codeofmorals.htm A Code of Morals].

The distance that heliograph signals could be seen depended on the clarity of the sky and the size of the mirrors used. A clear line of sight was required, and since the Earth's surface is curved, the highest convenient points were used. Under ordinary conditions, a flash could be seen 30 miles (48&amp;nbsp;km) with the naked eye, and much farther with a [[telescope]]. The maximum range was considered to be 10 miles for each inch of mirror diameter. Mirrors ranged from 1.5&amp;nbsp;inches to 12&amp;nbsp;inches or more.  The record distance was established by a detachment of U.S. signal sergeants by the inter-operation of stations on [[Mount Ellen (Utah)|Mount Ellen]], [[Utah]], and [[Uncompahgre Peak|Mount Uncompahgre]], [[Colorado]], 183 miles (295&amp;nbsp;km)  apart on September 17, 1894, with Signal Corps heliographs carrying mirrors only 8&amp;nbsp;inches square.&lt;ref name="Coe"&gt;Coe, Lewis [https://books.google.com/books?id=pzkZPIXm89UC  The Telegraph: A History of Morse's Invention and Its Predecessors in the United States].

The simple and effective instrument that Mance invented was to be an important part of military communications for more than 60 years. The usefulness of heliographs was limited to daytimes with strong sunlight, but they were the most powerful type of visual signalling device known. In pre-radio times heliography was often the only means of communication that could span ranges of as much as 100 miles with a lightweight portable instrument.&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt;

In the United States military, by mid-1878, Colonel [[Nelson A.

By 1887, heliographs in use included not only the British Mance and Begbie heliographs, but also the American Grugan, Garner and Pursell heliographs.  The Grugan and Pursell heliographs used shutters, and the others used movable mirrors operated by a finger key. The Mance, Grugan and Pursell heliographs used two tripods, and the others one. The signals could either be momentary flashes, or momentary obscurations.&lt;ref name="Finley"&gt;{{citation | publisher = The American Helio-Telegraph and Signal Light Company | year = 1887 | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=Mc90ZgreC8QC | title = An Improved Method in the Art of Signalling for Military and Scientific Purposes | accessdate = 1 June 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888, the US Signal Service reviewed all of these devices, as well as the Finley Helio-Telegraph,&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt; and finding none completely suitable, developed the US Signal Service heliograph, a two-tripod, shutter-based machine of 13 7/8&amp;nbsp;lb. total weight, and ordered 100 for a total cost of $4,205.&lt;ref name= "Signal"&gt;{{citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=88ctAAAAIAAJ | title = Annual Report of the Chief Signal Officer of the Army to the Secretary of War | year = 1889 | publisher = Google Books | accessdate = 3 June 2008 | pages= 43–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, the number of heliographs manufactured for the US Signal Service was 133.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Chief Signal Officer|year=1893|publisher=U.S. G.P.O.|pages=671|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aypHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heyday of the heliograph was probably the [[Second Boer War]] in South Africa, where it was much used by both the British and the Boers.&lt;ref name=Woods2008/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boer" /&gt;  The terrain and climate, as well as the nature of the campaign, made heliography a logical choice. For night communications, the British used some large [[Aldis lamp]]s, brought inland on railroad cars, and equipped with leaf-type shutters for keying a beam of light into dots and dashes. During the early stages of the war, the British garrisons were besieged in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], [[Siege of Ladysmith|Ladysmith]], and [[Siege of Mafeking|Mafeking]]. With land [[telegraph]] lines cut, the only contact with the outside world was via light-beam communication, helio by day, and Aldis lamps at night.&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt;

In 1909, the use of heliography for forestry protection was introduced in the United States. By 1920 such use was widespread in the US and beginning in Canada, and the heliograph was regarded as "next to the telephone, the most useful communication device that is at present available for forest-protection services".&lt;ref name="Forestry"/&gt; D.P. Godwin of the US Forestry Service invented a very portable (4.5&amp;nbsp;lb) heliograph of the single-tripod, shutter plus mirror type for forestry use.&lt;ref name="Forestry"/&gt;

Immediately prior to the outbreak of World War I,  the cavalry regiments of the Russian Imperial Army were still being trained in heliograph communications to augment the efficiency of their scouting and reporting roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Vladimir|last=Littauer|page=123|title=Russian Hussar|ISBN=1-59048-256-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Red Army]] during the Russian Civil War made use of a series of heliograph stations to disseminate intelligence efficiently about [[basmachi]] rebel movements in [[Turkestan]] in 1926.&lt;ref name="Red"&gt;{{citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qKnZtNHJrVAC | title = Central Asia: Aspects of Transition | first = Tom | last = Everett-Heath | accessdate = 3 June 2008 | page = 20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, South African and Australian forces used the heliograph against German forces in Libya and Egypt in 1941 and 1942.&lt;ref name=Woods2008/&gt;

The heliograph remained standard equipment for military [[signaller]]s in the Australian and [[British army|British armies]] until the 1940s, where it was considered a "low probability of intercept" type of communication. The [[Canadian Army]] was the last major army to have the heliograph as an issue item. By the time the mirror instruments were retired, they were seldom used for signalling.&lt;ref name= "Coe" /&gt; However, as recently as the 1980s, heliographs were used by [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] forces during the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=Woods2008&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Daniel|title=Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1851097325|page=208|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=RBC2nY1rp5MC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=heliograph|chapter=Heliograph and Mirrors|editor=Sterling, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Signal mirrors are still included in [[survival kit]]s for emergency signaling to [[search and rescue]] aircraft.&lt;ref name=Woods2008/&gt;

==Automated heliographs==

Most heliographs of the 19th and 20th century were completely manual.&lt;ref name="Forestry"/&gt; The steps of aligning the heliograph on the target, co-aligning the reflected sunbeam with the heliograph, maintaining the sunbeam alignment as the sun moved, transcribing the message into flashes, modulating the sunbeam into those flashes, detecting the flashes at the receiving end, and transcribing the flashes into the message, were all manual steps.&lt;ref name="Forestry"/&gt; One notable exception – many French heliographs used clockwork heliostats to automatically steer out the sun's motion.

An incandescent bulb has a CRI of 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.philips.com/c/energy-saving-light-bulbs/led-soft-white-12.5w-60w-dimmable-a19-046677422158/prd/en/?t=specifications |title= LED 12.5W A19 Soft White 12.5W (60W) Dimmable A19 |work= Energy-saving light bulbs |publisher=Philips |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''High-CRI LED lighting''' is a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) lighting source that offers a high [[color rendering index]] (CRI).

CRI is a quantitative measure of a light's ability to reproduce the colors of objects faithfully in comparison with an ideal or natural light source. In general terms, CRI is a measure of a light source's ability to show object colors "realistically" or "naturally" compared to a familiar reference source, either incandescent light or [[sunlight]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/nlpip/lightinganswers/lightsources/whatisColorRenderingIndex.asp#|title=What is color rendering index? {{!}} Light Sources and Color {{!}} Lighting Answers {{!}} NLPIP|last=|first=|date=|website=Lighting Research Center|publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Efficiently achieving an acceptable CRI has been the most difficult metric for [[light bulb]]s attempting to replace incandescent bulbs. It is therefore frequently ignored in marketing (the CRI value only occasionally appears on product packaging).{{Cn|date=April 2015}}  Light bulbs with a high CRI can be acceptable replacements for incandescent bulbs. Most LED lights do not have a CRI above 90. For example, the top bulbs listed in the 2016 Consumer Review have a CRI of 80.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/lightbulbs/buying-guide.htm|title=Lightbulb Buying Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=Consumer Reports|publisher=|access-date=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the US Department of Energy created the [[L Prize]] to find an incandescent light bulb replacement that met efficiency metrics and had a CRI above 90.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightingprize.org/overview.stm|title=L Prize Competition Overview|last=|first=|date=November 7, 2012|website=L Prize|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation==
CRI is calculated from the differences in the chromaticities of eight CIE standard color samples (CIE 1995) when illuminated by a light source and by a reference illuminant of the same correlated color temperature (CCT), commonly measured in [[Kelvins]], indicating the light color produced by a radiating black body at a certain temperature; the smaller the average difference in chromaticities, the higher the CRI. A CRI of 100 represents the maximum possible value. Lower CRI values indicate that some colors appear unnatural. Incandescent lamps have a CRI above 95. Cool white fluorescent lamps have a CRI of 62, however fluorescent lamps containing rare-earth [[phosphors]] are available with CRI values of 80 and above.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For CCTs less than 5000 K, the reference illuminants used in the CRI calculation procedure are the SPDs ([[Spectral power distribution|Spectral Power Distribution]]) of blackbody radiators; for CCTs above 5000 K, imaginary SPDs calculated from a mathematical model of sunlight are used. These reference sources were selected to approximate incandescent lamps and sunlight, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The CRI measure in use in 2017 was developed by the CIE in 1974 and slightly updated in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;CIE 13.3-1995, Method of Measuring and Specifying Colour Rendering Properties of Light Sources.&lt;/ref&gt; The measure has two main flaws. Its color differences are measured in a nonuniform color space. Its color sample set has just 8 items, which is too few to test lights with complex spectra. A light manufacturer can tune its SPD to the sample set so as to achieve an artifically high CRI. In 2015 the IES (Illumination Engineering Society) produced a replacement to the CRI measure&lt;ref&gt;IES-TM-30-15: Method for Evaluating Light Source Colour Rendition&lt;/ref&gt; that uses a newer color space and 99 color samples. In 2017 the CIE published an almost identical measure,&lt;ref&gt;CIE 224:2017, CIE 2017 Colour Fidelity Index for accurate scientific use&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not deprecate its 1995 CRI measure.

==Criticism==
CRI has been challenged because fidelity to reference illuminants such as [[Color temperature#Correlated color temperature|correlated color temperature]] (CCT) is not all that measures the quality of illumination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lumenistics.com/is-color-quality-scale-cqs-an-improvement-on-cri/|title=Is Color Quality Scale (CQS) an improvement on CRI? }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various CCTs are preferred, and scoring 100 at one CCT does not imply equal illumination quality as scoring 100 at another CCT.  The "warmer" light colors, such as a 2700K incandescent bulb or a 1700K candlelight are more easily reproduced than more neutral white lights, such as 4800K direct sunlight, and thus usually have higher CRI ratings in alternative light sources such as CFL and LED bulbs; "warmer" light (redder) naturally renders colors less accurately. Think of how the world looks at sunset (2000K) compared to high noon (5600K).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lowel.tiffen.com/edu/color_temperature_and_rendering_demystified.html|title=Color Temperature &amp; Color Rendering Index DeMystified|last=|first=|date=|website=Lowel EDU|publisher=Tiffen|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems have been encountered attempting to use LED lighting on film and video sets. The color spectra of LED lighting primary colors does not match the expected color wavelength bandpasses of film emulsions and digital sensors. As a result, color rendition can be unpredictable in optical prints, transfers to digital media from film and video camera recordings. This phenomenon with respect to motion picture film has been documented in an LED lighting evaluation series of tests produced by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] scientific staff.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Rocket man02 - melbourne show 2005.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|Rocketbelt pilot Dan Schlund at the 2005 Melbourne Show]]
A '''jet pack''', '''rocket belt''', or '''rocket pack''' is a device worn on the back which uses jets of gas or liquid to propel the wearer through the air. The concept has been present in science fiction for almost a century and became widespread in the 1960s. Real jet packs have been developed using a variety of mechanisms, but their uses are much more limited than their fictional counterparts because of the challenges of Earth's atmosphere, gravity, low energy density of available fuels, and the human body not being suited to fly, and they are principally used for stunts. A practical use for the jet pack has been in extra-vehicular activities for astronauts.

==Overview==
In the most general terms, a jet pack is a wearable device which allows the user to fly by providing [[thrust]]. With the exception of use in a [[microgravity]] environment, this thrust must be upwards so as to overcome the force of gravity, and must be enough to overcome the weight of the user, the jet pack itself and its fuel. This necessarily requires the jet pack to continually push mass in a downwards direction.&lt;ref name="whynot"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burnett|first1=Dean|title=Jetpacks: here’s why you don’t have one {{!}} Dean Burnett|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/23/jetpacks-science-scientists|accessdate=9 March 2018|work=the Guardian|date=23 September 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some designs have power and/or mass supplied from an external, ground-based source, untethered flight requires all of a flight's fuel to be carried within the pack. This results in problems relating to the overall [[mass ratio]], which limits the maximum flight time to tens of seconds, rather than the sustained flight envisaged in science fiction.&lt;ref name="whynot"/&gt;

==Liquid-fuelled rocket pack==

===Andreyev: oxygen-and-methane, with wings===
The first jet pack design was developed in 1919 by the Russian inventor Aleksandr Fyodorovich Andreyev. The project was well regarded by [[Nikolai Rynin]] and technology historians Yu. V. Biryukov and S. V. Golotyuk. Later it was issued a patent but apparently was not built or tested. It was [[oxygen]]-and-[[methane]]-powered (likeliest a rocket) with wings each roughly {{convert|3|ft|0|abbr=in|order=flip}} long!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Montandon |first=Mac |title=Jetpack Dreams: One Man's Up and Down (but Mostly Down) Search for the Greatest Invention That Never Was |page= |publisher=[[Da Capo Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-vz4goZYoCkC&amp;pg=PT16 |isbn=9780786726745 |quote=Around this time, a Russian fellow identifying himself as A. Andreev filed a patent for an oxygen- and methane-fueled flying device that could be worn on the back, with roughly three-foot wings extending to either side of the hopeful pilot... "This is the first device of its kind that had any engineering detail at all,"...|date=2008-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrogen peroxide-powered rocket packs==
A [[hydrogen peroxide]]-powered engine is based on the decomposition reaction of hydrogen peroxide. Nearly pure (90% in the Bell Rocket Belt) hydrogen peroxide is used. Pure hydrogen peroxide is relatively stable, but in contact with a [[catalyst]] (for example, [[silver]]) it decomposes into a mixture of [[superheated steam]] and [[oxygen]] in less than 1/10 [[millisecond]], increasing in volume 5,000 times: 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The reaction is [[exothermic]], i.e., accompanied by the liberation of much heat (about {{convert|2500|kJ/kg|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}), forming in this case a steam-gas mixture at {{convert|740|C|F|disp=sqbr}}. This hot gas is used exclusively as the [[reaction mass]] and is fed directly to one or more jet nozzles.

The great disadvantage is the limited operating time. The jet of steam and oxygen can provide significant thrust from fairly lightweight rockets, but the jet has a relatively low exhaust velocity and hence a poor [[specific impulse]]. Currently, such rocket belts can only fly for about 30 seconds (because of the limited amount of fuel the user can carry unassisted).

A more conventional bipropellant could more than double the specific impulse. However, although the exhaust gases from the peroxide-based engine are very hot, they are still significantly cooler than those generated by alternative propellants. Using a peroxide-based propellant greatly reduces the risk of a fire/explosion which would cause severe injury to the operator.

In contrast to, for example, [[turbojet]] engines, which mainly expel atmospheric air to produce thrust, rocket packs are far simpler to build than devices using turbojets. The classical rocket pack construction of Wendell Moore can be made under workshop conditions, given good engineering training and a high level of tool-making craftsmanship.

The main disadvantages of this type of rocket pack are:
* Short duration of flight (a maximum of around 30 seconds).
* The high expense of the peroxide propellant.
* The inherent dangers of flying below minimum [[parachute]] altitude, and hence without any safety equipment to protect the operator if there is an accident or malfunction.
* Safely learning how to fly it, given that there are no dual-control training versions.
* The sheer difficulty of manually flying such a device.
These circumstances limit the sphere of the application of rocket packs to very spectacular public demonstration flights, i.e., stunts; for example, a flight was arranged in the course of the opening ceremony of the [[1984 Summer Olympic Games]] in Los Angeles, USA.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Justin Capră's flying backpack===
[[Justin Capră]] claimed that he invented a "flying rucksack" (Romanian: ''rucsac zburator'') in 1956&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/romanian-who-claimed-to-invent-world-s-first-jetpack-dies-1.2197150 |title=Romanian who claimed to invent world's first jetpack dies |publisher=CTV News |date=20 January 2015 |accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Romania]], and, without arousing any apparent interest, informed the American Embassy of his idea. In 1962 a backpack was created at Bell Laboratories, following Justin Capră’s prototype. The backpack is now displayed in a museum where it's kept safe.

===Jump Belt===
In 1958, Garry Burdett and Alexander Bohr, [[Thiokol]] Corporation engineers, created a Jump Belt which they named Project Grasshopper. Thrust was created by high-pressure compressed [[nitrogen]]. Two small nozzles were affixed to the belt and directed vertically downward. The wearer of the belt could open a valve, letting out nitrogen from the [[gas cylinder]] through the nozzles, which tossed him upward to a height of {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}}. After leaning forward, it was possible with the aid of the jump belt's thrust to run at {{convert|45|to|50|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Later, Burdett and Bohr tested a [[hydrogen peroxide]]-powered version. The jump belt was demonstrated by a serviceman in action,{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} but as no financing was forthcoming, there was no further testing.

===Aeropack===
In 1959 [[Aerojet|Aerojet General Corporation]] won a U.S. Army contract to devise a jet pack or rocket pack. At the start of 1960 Richard Peoples made his first tethered flight with his Aeropack.

===U.S. Army interest===
The military did not lose interest in this type of flight vehicle. Transport studies of the U.S. Army Transportation Research Command (TRECOM) determined that personal jet devices could have diverse uses: for [[reconnaissance]], crossing rivers, amphibious landing, accessing steep mountain slopes, overcoming [[minefield]]s, tactical maneuvering, etc. The concept was named "Small Rocket Lift Device", SRLD.

Within the framework of this concept the administration concluded a big contract with the [[Aerojet|Aerojet General]] company in 1959 to research the possibility of designing an SRLD suitable for army purposes. Aerojet came to the conclusion that the version with the engine running on hydrogen peroxide was most suitable. However, it soon became known to the military that engineer Wendell Moore of the [[Bell Aerosystems]] company had for several years been carrying out experiments to make a personal jet device. After becoming acquainted with his work, servicemen during August 1960 decided to commission Bell Aerosystems with developing an SRLD. Wendell Moore was appointed chief project engineer.

===Bell Textron Rocket Belt===
{{Main|Bell Rocket Belt}}
[[Image:Gene shoemaker with rocket belt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[astrogeology|Astrogeologist]] [[Eugene Merle Shoemaker|Gene Shoemaker]] wearing a Bell Rocket Belt while training astronauts]]

In 1960, the [[Bell Aircraft|Bell]] Rocketbelt was presented to the public. The jet of gas was provided by a [[hydrogen peroxide]]-powered rocket, but the jet could also be provided by a [[turbojet]] engine, a ducted fan, or other kinds of rockets powered by solid fuel, liquid fuel or compressed gas (usually [[nitrogen]]).

This is the oldest known type of jet pack or rocket pack. One [[Bell Rocket Belt]] is on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]] annex, the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]], located near [[Dulles Airport]].

===RB-2000 Rocket Belt===

===Powerhouse Productions Rocketbelt===
[[Image:Rose-4.jpg|thumb|upright|Rocketbelt pilot Dan Schlund at the 2007 Rose Parade]]
More commonly known as "The Rocketman", Powerhouse Productions, owned and operated by Kinnie Gibson, manufactures the 30 second flying Rocketbelt (June 1994) and organizes Rocketbelt performances. Since 1983 Powerhouse Productions has performed show flights in over 40 countries such as the Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, Super Bowls, the [[Rose Parade]], [[Daytona 500]], and the [[Michael Jackson]] [[Dangerous World Tour]], as well as many television shows including Walker Texas Ranger, The Fall Guy and NCIS.

===Current technology===
At the [[TechCrunch Disrupt]] conference in 2014, [[Astro Teller]], head of [[Google X]] ([[Google]]'s research laboratory), said they investigated jetpacks but found them too inefficient to be practical, with fuel consumption as high as {{convert|1/4|mpgus|L/100km|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and were as loud as a motorcycle, so they decided not to pursue developing them.&lt;ref name="cnet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/google-x-head-says-no-google-jetpacks-coming/|title=Google X head: Sorry, world, no Google jetpacks for you}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2014/05/06/four-crazy-google-x-projects-that-failed/|title=Four Crazy Google X Projects That Failed | work=Forbes | first=Eric|last=Mack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the rocket pack has become popular among enthusiasts, and some have built them for themselves. The pack's basic construction is rather simple, but its flying capability depends on two key parts: the gas generator, and the thrust control valve. The rocket packs being built today are largely based on the research and inventions of Wendell Moore at [[Bell Helicopter]].

One of the largest stumbling blocks that would-be rocket pack builders have faced is the difficulty of obtaining concentrated [[hydrogen peroxide]], which is no longer produced by many chemical companies. The few companies that produce high-concentration hydrogen peroxide only sell to large corporations or governments, forcing some amateurs and professionals to set up their own hydrogen peroxide distillation installations. High-concentration hydrogen peroxide for rocket belts was produced by Peroxide Propulsion (Gothenburg, Sweden) from 2004 to 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peroxidepropulsion.com|title=Peroxide Propulsion :: Peroxide Propulsion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after a serious accident Peroxide Propulsion stopped making it.&lt;ref name="cnet.com"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2015}}

==Turbojet packs==
Packs with a [[turbojet]] engine are fueled with traditional [[kerosene]]-based jet fuel. They have higher [[fuel efficiency|efficiency]], greater height and a duration of flight of many minutes, but they are complex in construction and very expensive. Only one working model of this pack was made; it underwent flight tests in the 1960s and at present it no longer flies.
Jet packs and rocket packs have much better flight time on a tankful of fuel if they have wings like an aeroplane's.

===Bell Jet Flying Belt: wingless===
In 1965 Bell Aerosystems concluded a new contract with the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) to develop a jet pack with a turbojet engine. This project was called the "Jet Flying Belt", or simply the "Jet Belt". Wendell Moore and John K. Hulbert, a specialist in [[gas turbine]]s, worked to design a new turbojet pack. Williams Research Corporation (now [[Williams International]]) in [[Walled Lake, Michigan]], designed and built a new turbojet engine to Bell's specifications in 1969. It was called the WR19, had a rated thrust of {{convert|430|lbf|N|order=flip}} and weighed {{convert|68|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The Jet Belt first flew free on 7 April 1969 at the [[Niagara Falls International Airport|Niagara Falls Municipal Airport]]. Pilot Robert Courter flew about {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} in a circle at an altitude of {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}}, reaching a speed of {{convert|45|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. The following flights were longer, up to 5 minutes. Theoretically, this new pack could fly for 25 minutes at velocities up to {{convert|135|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.

In spite of successful tests, the U.S. Army lost interest. The pack was complex to maintain and too heavy. Landing with its weight on their back was hazardous to the pilot, and catastrophic loss of a turbine blade could have been lethal.

Thus, the Bell Jet Flying Belt remained an experimental model. On 29 May 1969, Wendell Moore died of complications from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] he had suffered six months earlier, and work on the turbojet pack was ended. Bell sold the sole version of the "Bell pack", together with the patents and technical documentation, to Williams Research Corporation. This pack is now in the Williams International company museum.

The "Jet Belt" used a small [[turbofan]] engine which was mounted vertically, with its air intake downward. Intake air was divided into two flows. One flow went into the combustion chamber, the other flow bypassed the engine, then mixed with the hot turbine gases, cooling them and protecting the pilot from the high temperatures generated. In the upper part of the engine the exhaust was divided and entered two pipes which led to jet nozzles. The construction of the nozzles made it possible to move the jet to any side. [[Kerosene]] fuel was stored in tanks beside the engine. Control of the turbojet pack was similar to the rocket pack, but the pilot could not tilt the entire engine. Maneuvering was by deflecting the nozzles. By inclining levers, the pilot could move the jets of both nozzles forward, back, or sideways. The pilot rotated left/right by turning the left handle. The right handle governed the engine thrust. The jet engine was started with the aid of a powder cartridge. While testing this starter, a mobile starter on a special cart was used. There were instruments to control the power of the engine, and a portable radio to connect and transmit telemetry data to ground-based engineers. On top of the pack was a standard auxiliary landing parachute; it was effective only when opened at altitudes above {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}}. This engine was later the basis for the propulsion units of Tomahawk and other [[cruise missile]]s.

===Visa Parviainen's jet-assisted wingsuit===
On 25 October 2005 in [[Lahti]] in [[Finland]], Visa Parviainen jumped from a [[hot air balloon]] in a [[wingsuit]] with two small [[turbojet]] [[jet engine]]s attached to his feet. Each turbojet provided approximately {{convert|16|kgf|N|abbr=on|order=flip}} of thrust and ran on [[kerosene]] (Jet A-1) fuel. Parviainen apparently achieved approximately 30 seconds of horizontal flight with no noticeable loss of altitude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bird-man.com/?n=windtunnel&amp;nose=6 BIRDMAN, Inc. / Oy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dropzone.com/news/General/First_jet_powered_Birdman_flight_613.html|title=First jet powered Birdman flight : Skydiving Articles - Dropzone.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yves Rossy's jet wingpack===
[[File:Yves Rossi mg 4627.jpg|thumb|right|Rossy's wing showing the four purple and silver jet-engines mounted close to the centre]]
Swiss ex-military and commercial pilot [[Yves Rossy]] developed and built a winged pack with rigid aeroplane-type [[carbon-fiber]] wings spanning about {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} and four small [[kerosene]]-burning [[Jetcat P400]] [[jet engine]]s underneath; these engines are large versions of a type designed for [[model aeroplane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jetcat.de/ JetCat Germany], [http://www.jetcatusa.com/ JetCat USA subsidiary]&lt;/ref&gt; He wears a heat-resistant suit similar to that of a [[firefighter]] or [[racing driver]] to protect him from the hot [[jet blast|jet exhaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank Jordans, AP (May 14, 2008). [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24617833/ "Rocket man flies on jet-powered wings"], [[MSNBC.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080514/ap_on_re_eu/switzerland_rocket_man |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517134644/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080514/ap_on_re_eu/switzerland_rocket_man |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, to further protect the wearer, the engines are modified by adding a [[carbon fibre]] heat shield extending the jet nozzle around the exhaust tail.

Rossy claims to be "the first person to gain altitude and maintain a stable horizontal flight thanks to aerodynamic carbon foldable wings", which are folded by hinges at their midpoint. After being lifted to altitude by a plane, he ignites the engines just before he exits the plane with the wings folded. The wings unfold while in free-fall, and he then can fly horizontally for several minutes, landing with the help of a [[parachute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|bEXxkWXncuo|Yves Rossy The Swiss Jet Man-ENGLISH TEXT under 'More info'}}&lt;/ref&gt; He achieves true controlled flight using his body and a hand throttle to maneuver; jet wingsuits use small turbojets, but differ from other aircraft in that the [[fuselage]] and [[flight control surfaces]] consist of a human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/07/how-to-fly-like-jetman/|title=‘Jetman’ Yves Rossy Shows Us How to Fly His Carbon Fiber Jet Wing|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=31 July 2013 |accessdate=1 August 2017 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170102151845/https://www.wired.com/2013/07/how-to-fly-like-jetman/ |archivedate=2 January 2017 |deadurl= no |quote= the subtle body movements he uses to maintain flight – and perform his loops, rolls, and other maneuvers – mimics a bird of prey. all of the flight control is done with body movement.

The system is said by Rossy to be highly responsive and reactive in flight, to the point where he needs to closely control his head, arm and leg movements to avoid an uncontrolled spin. The engines on the wing must be aligned precisely during set-up, also to prevent instability. An electronic starter system ensures that all four engines ignite simultaneously. In the event of a spin, the wing unit can be detached from the pilot, and pilot and wing unit descend to Earth separately, each with a parachute.

Since 2007, Rossy has conducted some of his flight tests from a private airfield, [[Skydive Empuriabrava]], in [[Empuriabrava]] ([[Girona]], [[Costa Brava]]), Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tv3.cat/videos/71209 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516215813/http://www.tv3.cat/videos/71209 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 May 2016 |title=Yves Rossy, "Jet Man", l'home a reacció |publisher=TV3 Catalonia |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=28 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.revistavanityfair.es/articulos/entrevistamos-a-yves-rossy-el-hombre-pajaro/19296 |title=Entrevistamos a Yves Rossy, el hombre pájaro en Skydive Empuriabrava |publisher=Vanity Fair |date=22 July 2015 |accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rossy's jet pack was exhibited on 18 April 2008 on the opening day of the 35th Exhibition of Inventions at [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daylife.com/photo/0aKOeAIdiCeDE Photo from Getty Images by AFP/Getty Images - Daylife] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601141103/http://www.daylife.com/photo/0aKOeAIdiCeDE |date=2008-06-01 }} at www.daylife.com&lt;/ref&gt; Rossy and his sponsors spent over $190,000 to build the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2008-05-14-swiss-fusion-man_N.htm|title=Swiss man soars above Alps with jet-powered wing (AP)|author=Frank Jordans|publisher=USA|date=14 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first successful trial flight was on 24 June 2004 near [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].

==In space==
[[File:Bruce McCandless II during EVA in 1984.jpg|thumb|[[Bruce McCandless II]] operating the [[Manned Maneuvering Unit]]]]
{{main|Astronaut propulsion unit}}
Rocket packs can be useful for [[spacewalk]]s. While near Earth a jet pack has to produce a [[g-force]] of at least 1{{sp}}g (a smaller g-force, providing only some deviation from [[free fall]] is of little use here), for excursions outside a free falling spaceship, a small g-force providing a small deviation from free fall is quite useful. Hence much less [[delta-v]] is consumed per unit time, and not during the whole EVA. With only small amounts of [[thrust]] needed, safety and temperature are much more manageable than in the atmosphere in Earth's gravity field.

Nevertheless, it is currently worn to be used only in case of emergency: the [[Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue]] (SAFER).

==Hydrojet packs==
[[File:Jetlev Jetpack.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jetlev]] water powered Jetpack]]
[[File:Flyboard Lesson - Merritt Island FL (2).jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Flyboard]] with its distinctive configuration of having the nozzles located below the pilot's feet]]
The 21st century has seen a new approach to jet packs where water is used as a high-density propulsion fluid.  This requires a very large mass of fluid that makes a self-contained jetpack infeasible.  Instead, this approach separates the engine, fuel and fluid supply from the pilot's flying apparatus, using a long flexible hose to feed the water to the jet nozzle pack attached to the pilot's body.  These inventions are known as "hydro jet packs", and successful designs have used jetski technology as the powerplant operating in a body of water (an ocean, lake, or  pool) to provide the needed propulsion. Several hydro jet pack approaches have been successfully tested and put into production. Flow rate can be controlled by a throttle operator on the jetski, or by the pilot using a remote actuator.

Another significant difference with hydro jet packs is that they can be operated below the surface as well as above it.  As of 2013, many hydro jet pack rental businesses are operating in various locations around the world.

===JetLev===
{{main|JetLev}}
The [[JetLev]] was the first hydroflight jetpack on the market, and its makers were awarded the first patents, in 2008, for hydrojetpacks. The JetLev has the appearance of a typical jet pack, with two nozzles on a backpack propelling the rider upwards. It just has an umbilicus to the powering jetski that provides the water for the thrust used.&lt;ref name=Amex-2013-05-23&gt; {{cite web |url= https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/raymond-li-of-jetlev-how-james-bond-inspired-him-to-invent-a-jet-pack/ |title= Raymond Li of Jetlev: How James Bond Inspired Him to Invent a Jet Pack |author= Katie Morell |date= 23 May 2013 |publisher= American Express }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marketwired-2016-08-17&gt; {{cite news |url= http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/zapata-industries-announces-acquisition-consolidation-hydro-flight-intellectual-property-otcqb-imsc-2151509.htm |title= Zapata Industries Announces the Acquisition and Consolidation of Hydro-Flight Intellectual Property Rights in the US and Abroad |publisher= Marketwired |date= 17 August 2016 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=H2RO-2016-09-14&gt; {{cite magazine |url= http://www.h2romagazine.com/h2ro-news/hydrofight |title= Hydrofight Sports – No this is not a typo |author= Blaine Jeffery |date= 14 September 2016 |publisher= H2RO Magazine }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Home-made versions==
[[MythBusters (2005 season)#Episode 32 – "Jet Pack"|Episode 32]] of ''[[MythBusters]]'' investigates the [[urban legend]] of an affordable jet pack or rocket pack that can be built from plans purchased on the Internet. Extensive modifications were made by the MythBusters team due to vagueness in the plans and because of the infeasibility of the specified engine mounting system. The jet pack produced by the MythBusters had two [[ducted fan]]s powered by [[ultralight]]-type piston engines. (Fans{{Who|date=May 2011}} complained that the use of piston engines destroyed the whole idea of the pack's being truly based on jets, by which, presumably, they meant self-contained gas turbines.) They found it was not powerful enough to lift a person off the ground, and was expensive to build. The plans specified a Rotax 503 [[ultralight]] engine, but they intended to use the more powerful and lighter Rotax 583 engine before a similar lighter unnamed engine was substituted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kwc.org/mythbusters/2005/06/mythbusters_jetpack_pyramid_po.html Annotated Mythbusters: Episode 32: Jetpack, Pyramid power&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at kwc.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
[[File:Amazbuck.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A jet pack {{disputed inline|Popular_Culture.3B_Iron_Man_and_Boba_Fett.3F|date=November 2015}} wearing hero on the cover of ''Amazing Stories'', August 1928. The cover illustrates ''[[The Skylark of Space]]''.]]
The concept of jet packs appeared in popular culture, particularly [[science fiction]], long before the technology became practical. Perhaps the first appearance was in [[pulp magazine]]s. The 1928 cover of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' featured a man flying with a jet pack.

When [[Republic Pictures]] planned to produce a [[superhero]] serial using its renowned "flying man" scenes as used in ''[[The Adventures of Captain Marvel]]'', the character of Captain Marvel was tied up in [[National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications|litigation with the owners of the character]] of [[Superman]].  For its postwar superhero serial, Republic used a jet pack in ''[[King of the Rocket Men]]''.  The same stock special effects were used in other serials.

While several science fiction novels from the 1950s featured jetpacks, it was not until the "Bell Rocket Belt" in the 1960s that the jet pack caught the imagination of the mainstream. Bell's demonstration flights in the U.S. and other countries created significant public enthusiasm.

Jetpacks were featured in two episodes ("Turu the Terrible" and "The Invisible Monster"), of the original ''[[Jonny Quest (TV series)|Jonny Quest]]'' (1964-1965) animated television series, and are seen at the end of the closing credits.&lt;ref name="Classic Jonny Quest Hardware"&gt;{{cite web|title=Classic Jonny Quest Hardware (specifically Aircraft: Portable Rocket Packs)|url=http://www.classicjq.com/info/lists/JQHardware.aspx|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 a jetpack appeared in the [[James Bond]] movie ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' when James Bond played by [[Sean Connery]] used a jet pack in the pre-title sequence to escape the bad guys and rendezvous with his French contact. The pack was piloted by [[Gordon Yaeger]] and Bill Suitor.

In the Irwin Allen television series ''[[Lost in Space]]'' (1965-1968), a jetpack was used by members of the Jupiter II expedition on several occasions.

In 1966 the plot of the 21st book in the [[Rick Brant]] series titled ''[[Rocket Jumper]]'' was based on a hydrogen peroxide fueled jet pack, The book included a relatively detailed description of the design including use of a platinum-metal screen catalyst.

In the 1997 video game Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, the titular character Crash, operates a jetpack in two main levels, "Rock It" and "Pack Attack". He also uses the jetpack in the final boss fight against Dr. Neo Cortex.

The 1976 television series ''[[Ark II]]'' featured a jetpack called the Jet Jumper.

In the ''[[Star Wars]]'' original trilogy, the bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]] used a jet pack. In the prequel trilogy, [[Jango Fett]] also used a jet pack.
 
In the 1982-1995 comics book series, ''[[The Rocketeer]]'', the protagonist, Cliff Secord, acquires a stolen military jet pack and uses it to become the eponymous superhero. It was later adapted into a [[The Rocketeer (film)|motion picture]] in 1991.

The {{convert|3.75|in|adj=on|order=flip|abbr=in}} [[G.I. Joe]] action figure launch in 1982 included the JUMP (Jet Mobile Propulsion Unit) jet pack as an accessory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JUMP JET MOBILE PROPULSION UNIT|url=http://www.yojoe.com/vehicles/82/jump/|accessdate=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also featured prominently in the related ''G.I. Joe'' comic book series and cartoon.

Jetpacks have been used by the title characters in several episodes of ''[[SWAT Kats]]'' cartoon series (1993–94).&lt;ref name="SWAT Kats Encyclopaedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Screenshots from Episode "When Strikes Mutilor" (specifically 016167) |url=http://swatkats.info/episodes/season-2/when-strikes-mutilor/screenshots |accessdate=21 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218160906/http://swatkats.info/episodes/season-2/when-strikes-mutilor/screenshots |archivedate=18 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jetpacks appear in the popular video game ''[[Halo: Reach]]''. On September 13, 2010, during a ''Halo: Reach'' launch party at London, England's Trafalgar Square, stuntman Dan Schlund of Powerhouse Productions Inc "Rocketman" firm (which provides jet packs for use by marketing and sporting companies) donned a Halo-esque "Spartan armor" suit and a jet pack and maintained flight for 30 seconds before landing safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1311619/Halo-Reach-Rocketman-takes-skies-London-promote-new-Xbox-game.html | work=Daily Mail | title=Halo: Reach: Rocketman jets into Trafalgar Square to promote new Xbox game | date=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The jet-pack also appears in the 2012 video game ''[[Halo 4]]'', developed by [[343 Industries]].

Jetpacks also appeared in other video games, including ''[[BloodRayne]]'' (worn by Nazi troopers), ''[[Tribes (series)|Tribes]]'', ''[[Giants: Citizen Kabuto]]'', ''[[Armed and Dangerous (video game)|Armed and Dangerous]]'', and the [[Pilotwings (series)|''Pilotwings'']] series, in which it is referred to as a "Rocket Belt". It is also accessible in the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]''.  ''[[Fallout 4]]'' also has a jetpack power armor feature. [[Grand Theft Auto Online]] added a jetpack called "Thruster" as an usable vehicle on a content update on December 12, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/12/gta-onlines-doomsday-heistslet-players-enter-mount-chilliad-with-jetpacks/ |title=GTA Online's Doomsday Heists Takes Players Inside Mount Chilliad (With Jetpacks) &amp;#124; Kotaku Australia |publisher=Kotaku.com.au |date=2017-12-11 |accessdate=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many science fiction movies have included jet packs, most notably ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]'', and ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]''.

'''Mac vs Windows''' (formerly XvsXP) was an online [[operating system]] comparison wiki run by James Scariati and Michael Moriarty. The site is no longer active and its domains now point to [[spam blog]]s.

==Overview==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Xvsxp main.JPG|thumbnail|right|225px|Screenshot of XvsXP main page.{{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;
The site compares competing operating systems [[Windows Vista]] and [[Mac OS X v10.5]] through over 100 different topics.  The site explicitly includes only the "out-of-the-box" experience of each OS, as well as any freely released updates from the manufacturer. A unique feature of the site over many other OS comparison sites is that it features a forum to encourage readers to voice any concerns or comments about the site, as well as any suggestions for additions.

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Xvsxp comparison.JPG|thumbnail|left|225px|Example comparison.{{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;
The site was originally launched in March 2003 by Dan Pouliot, with the scope of the site explicit also to the concerns of the "creative professional". The site was originally intended to advocate OS X by virtue of a fair comparison to Windows XP.  Pouliot acknowledged that such a fair comparison was difficult, and he relied on debates within the site's own online forum to refine and expand the site. A PDF version of the site was available, and Pouliot reports it was downloaded 250,000 times between the launch of the site and the time the PDF was removed in January 2005.

The site was almost closed down in January 2005, including a brief period when XvsXP was converted to a [[pay site]]. Pouliot at that time decided he needed to move on, so a change of ownership was negotiated.

In November 2005, the site officially changed hands to the current owners, James Scariati and Michael Moriarty, and a rewrite of the site began, with a renewed objective of an unbiased comparison. The point of view was changed away from first person. Content considered to be editorial in nature was removed.{{efn|One example that was removed can be seen in the Internet Archive Wayback Machine: [https://web.archive.org/web/20040415221224/http://www.xvsxp.com/dialogs/] where Pouliot discussed one particular XP dialog box at length.}}

The site officially relaunched in March 2006, sporting a refreshed look and updated sections, as well as a format that was reportedly designed for ease of updating due to the upcoming releases of both operating systems, [[Windows Vista]] and [[Mac OS X v10.5]].

On June 20, 2007, XvsXP.com owners announced they were moving to a new website, ''Mac vs. Windows'' (www.macvswindows.com). One of the main new features introduced with their new website was the transition to a wiki model.

==Criticism==

The website does not take into account factors such as software availability, total cost of ownership, hardware interoperability and so forth. The owners contend that such topics fall outside of the site's scope as an operating system comparison and fall into a broader platform comparison{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Both owners have stated that even the current comparison is a large amount of work, so a truly objective comparison of all aspects of each platform would require a team of full-time employees. In addition, the current "1 to 10" scoring system has been viewed as being too definitive for a subjective review.  This is also compounded in the "Final Score" page where there is no option to weigh the scores based on the user's concerns.  (e.g. security is given as much weight as icons).

Further criticism of XvsXP can be lodged for the continued delays in providing coverage of the Windows side of the comparison.  As of June 10, 2007, the site still fails to show data on Windows Vista, over seven months after Vista’s Release to Manufacturing (RTM).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2006/nov06/11-08VistaRTM.mspx&lt;/ref&gt; This even though one of the XvsXP admins acknowledged (over four months ago) that Vista was released (their initial acknowledgement [February 8, 2007] of Vista came three months after it went RTM).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xvsxp.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mobile equipment identifier (MEID)''' is a globally unique number identifying a physical piece of [[CDMA2000]] mobile station equipment. The number format is defined by the [https://www.3gpp2.org/Public_html/Specs/S.R0048-A_v4.0_050630.pdf 3GPP2 report S.R0048] but in practical terms, it can be seen as an [[IMEI]] but with [[hexadecimal]] digits.

An MEID is 56 [[bit]]s long (14 hex digits). It consists of three fields, including an 8-bit regional code (RR), a 24-bit manufacturer code, and a 24-bit manufacturer-assigned serial number. The check digit (CD) is not considered part of the MEID.

The MEID was created to replace [[electronic serial number|ESN]]s, whose virgin form was exhausted in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiaonline.org/sites/default/files/pages/esn_meid_milestones_timeline.pdf "ESN Migration to MEID - Milestones &amp; Timeline"], The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA), 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; As of TIA/EIA/IS-41 Revision D and TIA/EIA/IS-2000 Rev C, the ESN is still a required field in many messages—for compatibility, devices with an MEID can use a pseudo-ESN (pESN), which is a manufacturer code of 0x80 (formerly reserved) followed by the least significant 24 bits of the [[SHA-1]] hash of the MEID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cdg.org/devices/meid.asp | title=Devices: MEID &amp; EUIMID | publisher=CDG | accessdate=29 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MEIDs are used on CDMA mobile phones. GSM phones do not have ESN or MIN, only an International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI) number.

==Obtaining the MEID on your phone==
Open your phone's dialler and type *#06# to get its MEID number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bader | first = Daniel | title = How to make sure your phone works on a prepaid alternative carrier | url = https://www.imore.com/how-make-sure-your-phone-works-prepaid-alternative-carrier | work = [[iMore]] | date = 21 March 2017 | accessdate = 24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
The separation between international mobile equipment identifiers (IMEIs) used by GSM/UMTS and MEIDs is based on the number ranges. There are two administrators: the global decimal administrator (GDA) for IMEIs and the global hexadecimal administrator (GHA).

As of August 2006, the TIA acts as the GHA to assign MEID code prefixes (0xA0 and up), and the GSM Association acts as the global decimal administrator. http://www.babt.com/gsm-imei-number-allocation.asp

The TIA also allocates IMEI codes, specifically destined for dual-technology phones, out of the RR=99 range. Other administrators working under GSMA may also allocate any IMEI for use in dual-technology phones. Every IMEI can also be used as an MEID in CDMA2000 devices (as well as in single-mode devices designed with GSM or other 3GPP protocols) but MEID codes may also contain hexadecimal digits and this class of MEID codes cannot be used as an IMEI.

==Display formats==
There are two standard formats for MEIDs, and both can include an optional check-digit. This is defined by [http://www.3gpp2.org/Public_html/specs/X.S0008-0_v2.0_051018.pdf 3GPP2 standard X.S0008].

The hexadecimal form is specified to be 14 digits grouped together and applies whether all digits are in the decimal range or whether some are in the range 'A'-'F'. In the first case, all digits are in the range '0'-'9', the check-digit is calculated using the normal base 10 [[Luhn]] algorithm, but if at least one digit is in the range 'A'-'F' this check digit algorithm uses base 16 arithmetic. The check-digit is never transmitted or stored. It is intended to detect most (but not all) input errors, it is not intended to be a checksum or CRC to detect transmission errors. Consequently, it may be printed on phones or their packaging in case of manual entry of an MEID (e.g. because there is no bar  code or the bar code is unreadable).

The decimal form is specified to be 18 digits grouped in a 5 5 4 4 pattern and is calculated by converting the manufacturer code portion (32 bits) to decimal and padding on the left with '0' digits  to 10 digits and separately converting the serial number portion to decimal and padding on the left to 8 digits. A check-digit can be calculated from the 18 digit result using the standard base 10 [[Luhn]] algorithm and appended to the end. Note that to produce this form the MEID digits are treated as base 16 numbers even if all of them are in the range '0'-'9'.

==pESN conflicts==
Because the pESN is formed by a hash on the MEID there is the potential for hash collisions. These will cause an extremely rare condition known as a 'collision' on a pure ESN-only network as the ESN is used for the calculation of the Public Long Code Mask (PLCM) used for communication with the base-station. Two mobiles using the same pESN within the same base-station area (operating on the same frequency) can result in call setup and page failures.

The probability of a collision has been carefully examined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiaonline.org/standards/resources/esn/documents/Collisions_pESN_wp.pdf Pellegrino G, Quick F. White Paper on Pseudo-ESN Collisions. TIA. 26 May 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly, it is estimated that even on a heavily loaded network the frequency of this situation is closer to 1 out of 1 million calls than to 1 out of 100 000.

3GPP2 specification [http://www.3gpp2.org/Public_html/specs/C.S0072-0_v1.0_050727.pdf C.S0072] provides a solution to this problem by allowing the PLCM to be established by the base station. It is easy for the base station to ensure that all PLCM codes are unique when this is done. This specification also allows the PLCM to be based on the MEID or [[International mobile subscriber identity|IMSI]].

A different problem occurs when ESN codes are stored in a database (such as for [[OTASP]]). In this situation, the risk of at least two phones having the same pseudo-ESN can be calculated using the [[birthday paradox]] and works out to about a 50 per cent probability in a database with 4,800 pseudo-ESN entries. 3GPP2 specifications [http://www.3gpp2.org/Public_html/specs/C.S0016-C_v1.0_041025.pdf C.S0016] (Revision C or higher) and [http://www.3gpp2.org/Public_html/specs/C.S0066-0_v1.0_040830.pdf C.S0066] have been modified to allow the replacement MEID identifier to be transmitted, resolving this problem.

Another problem is that messages delivered on the forward paging channel using the pESN as an address could be delivered to multiple mobiles seemingly randomly. This problem can be avoided by using [[mobile identification number]] (MIN) or IMSI based addressing instead.

==Code to convert==
This short [[Python (programming language)|Python]] script will convert an MEID to a pESN.
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
import hashlib

meid = input("Enter a MEID: ").upper()

bytes = bytearray.fromhex(meid)
s = hashlib.sha1(bytes)
    #decode the hex MEID (convert it to binary!)

pesn = "80" + s.hexdigest()[-6:].upper()
    #put the last 6 digits of the hash after 80

print("pESN: " + pesn)
&lt;/source&gt;

The CDG also provides a [http://www.cdg.org/devices/meid/meid_euimid_calculator.asp javascript calculator with more conversion options].

At equilibrium, the relationship between water content and equilibrium humidity of a material can be displayed graphically by a curve, the so-called '''moisture sorption isotherm'''. 
For each [[humidity]] value, a [[sorption isotherm]] indicates the corresponding [[water content]] value at a given, constant temperature. If the composition or quality of the material changes, then its sorption behaviour also changes. Because of the complexity of sorption processes, the isotherms cannot be determined by calculation, but must be recorded experimentally for each product.

The relationship between water content and [[water activity]] (a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;) is complex. An increase in a&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is usually accompanied by an increase in water content, but in a non-linear fashion. This relationship between water activity and moisture content at a given temperature is called the moisture sorption isotherm. These curves are determined experimentally and constitute the fingerprint of a food system.

A '''mud engineer''' (correctly called a Drilling Fluids Engineer, but most often referred to as the "Mud Man"&lt;ref name="Roughnecks"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5mjaZXcPEzkC|title=Roughnecks, Rock Bits and Rigs: The Evolution of Oil Well Drilling Technology in Alberta, 1883-1970|last=Gow|first=Bonar Alexander|last2=Gow|first2=Sandy|date=2005|publisher=University of Calgary Press|isbn=9781552380673|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ogs.ou.edu/pdf/Drillrigseq.pdf|title=Drill Rigs and Nomenclature|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) works on an [[oil well]] or [[gas well]] [[drilling rig]], and is responsible ensuring the properties of the [[drilling fluid]], also known as [[drilling mud]], are within designed specifications.

==Use of mud==
{{main|drilling mud}}
Mud is a vital part of drilling operations. It provides [[hydrostatic pressure]] on the borehole wall to prevent uncontrolled production of reservoir fluids, lubricates and cools the [[drill bit]], carries the drill cuttings up to the surface, forms a "filter-cake" on the borehole wall to prevent drilling fluid invasion, provides an information  medium for well logging, and helps the drilling by fracturing the rock from the jets in the bit.  To fulfill these tasks effectively, the mud contains carefully chosen additives to control its chemical and rheological properties.

Drilling mud is usually a [[shear thinning]] [[non-Newtonian fluid]] of variable [[viscosity]]. When it is under more shear, such as in the pipe to the bit and through the bit nozzles, viscosity is lower which reduces pumping-power requirements. When returning to the surface through the much roomier annulus it is under less shear stress and becomes more viscous, and hence better able to carry the rock cuttings. [[Bentonite]] is commonly used as an additive to control and maintain viscosity, and also has the additional benefit of forming a mud-cake (also known as a filter cake) on the bore-hole wall, preventing fluid invasion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=bentonite Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary – Bentonite&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barite]] is commonly used to "weight" the mud to maintain adequate hydrostatic pressure down-hole. This is critical in a drilling operation to avoid a kick and ultimately a [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]] from uncontrolled production of formation fluids.  The "mud-pits" at the surface have their levels carefully monitored, since an increase in the mud level indicates a kick is taking place, and may require shutting in the well and circulating heavier weighted drilling mud to prevent further formation fluid or gas production.

[[Drilling fluid]] must be chemically compatible with the formations being drilled. Salinity must be chosen so as not to cause clay swelling or other problems.  Mud can be "oil-based" or "water-based". In many areas oil-based muds are being phased out, as they are less environmentally friendly, although in some formations they are necessary because of chemical compatibility issues. Offshore rigs typically use synthetic oil based mud.

==The Job==
The mud engineer (or drilling fluids engineer) may be a university, college, or technical institute graduate, having gained experience working on rigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=How to become a mud engineer | url=https://careertrend.com/how-7233973-become-mud-engineer.html | last1=Moore | first1=Rachel | date=2017-07-05 | publisher=Career Trend }}&lt;/ref&gt; On land, this experience would come from being a derrick hand, and offshore, the experience would come from being a pump man. Prior to working on his own, he has been on a special training course, known as "mud school", and often spends time working with a senior mud engineer to gain experience. 

Before the mid-1940s, the [[driller (oil)|driller]] dealt with drilling mud; but specialization occurred with the increasing complexity and overlapped more with the geologist.&lt;ref name="Roughnecks"/&gt;

Prior to drilling a well, a "mud program" will be worked out according to the expected geology, in which products to be used, concentrations of those products, and fluid specifications at different depths are all predetermined. As the hole is drilled and gets deeper, more mud is required, and the mud engineer is responsible for making sure that the new mud to be added is made up to the required specifications.  The chemical composition of the mud will be designed so as to stabilize the hole.  It is sometimes necessary to completely change the mud to drill through a particular subsurface layer.  

As drilling proceeds, the mud engineer will get information from other service providers such as the mud logger ([[mud logging]] technician) about progress through the geological zones, and will make regular physical and chemical checks on the [[drilling mud]].  In particular the [[Marsh funnel]] [[viscosity]] and the [[density]] are frequently checked.  As drilling proceeds, the mud tends to accumulate small particles of the rocks which are being drilled through, and its properties change.  It is the job of the mud engineer to specify additives to correct these changes, or to partially or wholly replace the mud when necessary.  He or she must also keep an eye on the equipment which is used to pump the mud and to remove particles, and be prepared if the geologists' predictions are not entirely correct, or if other problems arise.

It is sometimes necessary to stabilize the wall of a borehole at a particular depth by pumping cement down through the mud system, and the mud engineer is sometimes in charge of this process.

The mud engineer is well supported by the mud supply company with computer aids and manuals dealing with all known problems and their solution, but it is his or her responsibility to get it right in a situation where mistakes can be very costly indeed.

A mud engineer's job may involve long shifts of over 12 hours a day. Typical offshore and foreign work schedules are four weeks working and four weeks off.

==Important Fluid Properties==
One of the most important mud properties is the mud weight (density).  If the mud weight exceeds the fracture pressure of the formation, the formation may fracture and large quantities of mud are lost to it, in a situation referred to as lost circulation. These cracks can also cause water to seep into the well bore or into a [[hydrocarbon]] bearing zone, which would likely impede the ability of the formation to produce oil (or require the separation of large quantities of water).

Conversely, if the mud weight is too low it will have a hydrostatic pressure that is less than the formation pressure.  This will cause pressurized fluid in the formation to flow into the wellbore and make its way to the surface.  This is referred to as a formation "kick" and can lead to a potentially deadly [[Blowout (well drilling)| blowout]] if the invading fluid reaches the surface uncontrolled.

Other important mud properties to be maintained are the YP ([[Yield Point]]) which determines the carrying capacity of the mud to carry the drill cuttings to the surface. Mud should be capable of forming a thin "mud cake" which forms a lining of the [[borehole]] walls.

==Drilling Fluids Companies==
Drilling fluids operations are often contracted to service companies, a trend commonly observed in the oil industry for most of it operations. The largest four companies for mud services are M-I SWACO (A [[Schlumberger]] Company), Baroid Drilling Fluids ([[Halliburton]] Oilfield Services), [[Baker Hughes]] Drilling Fluids, and [[Weatherford International]] Drilling Fluids and Drilling Waste Management. There are, however, many smaller companies providing drilling fluid services as well. Independent companies can provide a localized knowledge, and quality services and mud products.
Hamilton Technologies is also the largest independent drilling fluids company presently in West Africa

The '''NE1000'''/'''NE2000''' is an early line of low cost [[Ethernet]] [[network card]]s originally produced by [[Novell]] by 1987. Its popularity had a significant impact on the pervasiveness of networks in computing. They are based on a [[National Semiconductor]] prototype design using their 8390 Ethernet chip.

[[Image:Ne1000.jpg|right|thumb|NE1000 8-bit ISA card (rev B, added AUI port for transceiver)]]
[[Image:Ne2000.jpg|right|thumb|NE2000 16-bit ISA card (rev B, added AUI port for transceiver)]]

== History ==
In the late 1980s, Novell was looking to shed its hardware server business and transform its flagship [[Novell NetWare|NetWare]] product into a [[IBM Personal Computer|PC]]-based server operating system that was agnostic and independent of the physical network implementation and [[Network topology|topology]] (Novell even referred to NetWare as a NOS, or "network operating system"). To do this, Novell needed networking technology in general &amp;mdash; and networking cards in particular &amp;mdash; to become a commodity, so that the server operating system and protocols would become the differentiating technology.

Most of the key pieces of this strategy were already in place: Ethernet and token ring (among others) had been codified by the [[IEEE]] [[IEEE 802|802 standards]] committee &amp;mdash; the draft was not formally adopted until 1990, but was already in widespread use, and cards from one vendor were, on the whole, wire-compatible with cards complying with the same 802 working group. However, networking hardware vendors in general, and industry leaders 3Com and IBM in particular, were charging high prices for their hardware.

To combat this, Novell decided to develop its own line of cards. In order to create these at minimal [[research and development|R&amp;D]], [[Electrical engineering|engineering]] and [[Manufacturing|production]] costs, Novell simply implemented, almost verbatim, a prototype design created by [[National Semiconductor]] using the 8390 Ethernet chip.  National Semiconductor, for its part, had no qualms about the use of the design; the use of National Semiconductor chips made the proposal almost pure profit. However, since the design had been intended only as a proof-of-concept prototype, it implemented bare-minimum functionality: [[Programmed I/O|PIO]] was used instead of [[Direct Memory Access|DMA]], no [[Buffer (computer science)|buffering]] was provided and no provision was made for the use of a [[Medium Attachment Unit|transceiver]].

The original card, the NE1000 (8-bit [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]]; announced as "E-Net adapter" in February 1987 for {{nowrap|495 USD}})&lt;ref name="E-net anno"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Novell to Add Features To Advanced Netware|journal=Network World|date=1987-02-23|first=|last=|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=%22E-net%22+novell&amp;hl=en|accessdate=2012-01-15}} "The company announced an Ethernet adapter card priced lower than competitive products, many of which Novell distributes. The E-Net adapter, which uses an 8-bit bus and can be used with either thin or thick Ethernet cabling, is priced at $495. The product will most likely replace 3Com's $595 Etherlink card in Novell's line."&lt;/ref&gt; The "NE" prefix stood for "Novell Ethernet".

=== NE2000 ===
The NE2000, using the 16-bit ISA bus of the [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|PC AT]] followed in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  |title=Novell unveils LAN gear, new version of NetWare|journal=Network World|date=1988-05-16|first=Laura|last=DiDio|coauthors=|volume=5|issue=20|pages=4, 71|id= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GRIEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=novell%20NE2000%20review&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=novell%20NE2000%20review&amp;f=false|format=|accessdate=2009-12-03 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses [[10BASE2|thin Ethernet]]; the second ("B") revision added an [[Attachment Unit Interface]] (AUI) port to support a transceiver, and later models NE1000T and NE2000T added built-in [[Ethernet over twisted pair|10BASE-T]] support. 

With the launch of the NE1000 / NE2000, Novell took two significant steps.

The first was a program under which other vendors were invited to manufacture the cards with no royalty as "NE1000-compatible" cards. Vendors were required to submit their cards to Novell for certification which focused on whether the standard Novell driver worked with the card. In a sense, this was a first step toward [[open-source hardware]]. Interested manufacturers were given a complete package of manufacturing documentation to allow them to start building NE1000/2000 compatible cards without having to do any design work. The primary intent of this program was to drive down the cost of network hardware to promote the adoption of PC networking.

The second innovation taken, primarily to deal with internal management issues, was to allow Novell's distributors to buy the cards directly from its manufacturer, Eagle, a contract manufacturing subsidiary of Anthem Technologies, the industrial distributor which provided the components for the NE1000/2000. Novell received a royalty on each card, but was no longer involved in scheduling and ordering manufacturing.

In order to remain competitive with Novell's bargain-price cards, [[3Com]] and other vendors were forced to cut the pricing of their entry-level network cards, contributing greatly to the networking boom of the 1990s.  To a lesser extent, it is arguable that the success of the NE1000/2000 cards helped to tip the scale of the "LAN wars" in favor of [[Ethernet]] (championed by 3Com) over [[token ring]] (championed by [[IBM]]), though its main impact was to significantly lower the cost of PC networks.

In 2003 National Semiconductor ceased manufacturing of the 8390 chip.

== Clones ==
[[Image:Ethernetkarte_EZ2000.jpg|thumb|NE2000 compatible {{nowrap|10 Mbit/s}} ISA 16-bit [[Legacy Plug and Play|PnP]] card]]

Many other manufacturers copied the design labeling under their own brand, while still claiming NE1000/NE2000 compatibility. However, in reality this was not always the case. For instance, the Winbond 83C901 ignores the reset signal.&lt;ref name="web_bilkent_edu_tr-Ethernet-HOWTO-3_html_ne2k-probs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Linux Ethernet-Howto: Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/Linux/HOWTO/Ethernet-HOWTO-3.html#ne2k-probs}} 090428 web.bilkent.edu.tr&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supported operating systems ==
Besides NetWare, driver support for these cards was (and still is) available for a variety of operating systems, including [[DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[UNIX]], [[FreeBSD]], [[QNX]], and [[Linux]].&lt;ref name="beowulf_es_embnet_org-ne2k-pci"&gt;{{cite web|title=PCI NE2000 cards and Linux|url=http://beowulf.es.embnet.org/linux/drivers/ne2k-pci.html}} 090428 beowulf.es.embnet.org&lt;/ref&gt; Note that [[Windows XP]] does not support non-[[Plug and Play]] versions and [[Windows Vista]] does not support the NE2000 at all. [[Windows 2000]] appears to have a working driver.

A '''nanonetwork''' or '''nanoscale network''' is a set of interconnected [[nanomachines]] (devices a few hundred [[nanometer]]s or a few [[micrometer]]s at most in size), which are able to perform only very simple tasks such as [[computing]], [[data storing]], [[sense|sensing]] and actuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author= J.

F., {{ISBN|978-1-60807-003-9}}, Artech House, 2010. [https://www.amazon.com/Nanoscale-Communication-Networks-Stephen-Bush/dp/1608070034]&lt;/ref&gt; Nanonetworks are expected to expand the capabilities of single nanomachines both in terms of complexity and range of operation by allowing them to coordinate, share and fuse information. Nanonetworks enable new applications of [[nanotechnology]] in the [[biomedical]] field, [[Natural environment|environmental]] research, military technology and industrial and [[consumer goods]] applications. Nanoscale communication is defined in [[IEEE P1906.1]].

==Communication approaches==
Classical communication paradigms need to be revised for the nanoscale. The two main alternatives for communication in the nanoscale are based either on electromagnetic communication or on molecular communication.

===Electromagnetic===
This is defined as the transmission and reception of [[electromagnetic radiation]] from components based on novel [[nanomaterials]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Rutherglen and P. J. Burke "Nano-Electromagnetics: Circuit and Electromagnetic Properties of Carbon Nanotubes," Small, 5(8), 884–906 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Recent advancements in [[carbon]] and [[molecular electronics]] have opened the door to a new generation of electronic nanoscale components such as [[nanobatteries]],&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Curtright, P. J. Bouwman, R. C. Wartane and K. E. Swider-Lyons, "Power Sources for Nanotechnology," International Journal of Nanotechnology, Vol. 1, pp. 226–239, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; nanoscale [[energy harvesting]] systems,&lt;ref&gt;Z. L. Wang, "Towards Self-Powered Nanosystems: From Nanogenerators to Nanopiezotronics," Advanced Functional Materials, Vol. 18, pp. 3553–3567, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; nano-memories,&lt;ref&gt;Bennewitz, R.; Crain, J. N.; Kirakosian, A.; Lin, J.-L.; McChesney, J. L.; Petrovykh, D. Y. &amp; Himpsel, F. J. Atomic scale memory at a silicon surface Nanotechnology, Vol. 13, pp. 499–502, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; logical circuitry in the nanoscale and even nano-antennas.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Burke, Shengdong Li, Zhen Yu "Quantitative theory of nanowire and nanotube antenna performance," IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology Vol. 5 n. 4, pp. 314–334, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Burke, Chris Rutherglen, and Zhen Yu, "Carbon Nanotube Antennas," in Proc. SPIE Int. Soc. Opt. Eng. 6328, 632806-1, 2006 .&lt;/ref&gt; From a communication perspective, the unique properties observed in nanomaterials will decide on the specific [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidths]] for emission of electromagnetic radiation, the time lag of the emission, or the magnitude of the emitted power for a given input energy, amongst others.

For the time being, two main alternatives for electromagnetic communication in the nanoscale have been envisioned. First, it has been experimentally demonstrated that is possible to receive and [[demodulate]] an electromagnetic wave by means of a [[nanoradio]], i.e., an electromechanically resonating [[carbon nanotube]] which is able to decode an amplitude or frequency modulated wave.&lt;ref&gt;B. Atakan and O. Akan, "Carbon nanotube-based nanoscale ad hoc networks," IEEE Communications Magazine, Vol. 48 , n. 6, pp. 129–135, June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, graphene-based nano-antennas have been analyzed as potential electromagnetic radiators in the [[Terahertz band]]&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Jornet and [[Ian F. Akyildiz]], "Graphene-based Nano-antennas for Electromagnetic Nanocommunications in the Terahertz Band," in Proc. of EUCAP 2010, Fourth European Conference on Antennas and Propagation, Barcelona, Spain, April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular===
[[Molecular communication]] is defined as the transmission and reception of information by means of molecules&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Communication|last=T. Nakano, A. Eckford, and T. Haraguchi|first=|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1107023086|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The different molecular communication techniques can be classified according to the type of molecule propagation in walkaway-based, flow-based or diffusion-based communication.

In '''walkway-based''' molecular communication, the molecules propagate through pre-defined pathways by using carrier substances, such as [[molecular motors]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Moore, A. Enomoto, T. Nakano, R. Egashira, T. Suda, A. Kayasuga, H. Kojima, H. Sakakibara, and K. Oiwa, "A Design of a Molecular Communication System for Nanomachines Using Molecular Motors," in Proc. Fourth Annual IEEE Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications and Workshops, March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This type of molecular communication can also be achieved by using [[E. coli]] bacteria as [[chemotaxis]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Gregori and [[Ian F. Akyildiz]], "A New NanoNetwork Architecture using Flagellated Bacteria and Catalytic Nanomotors," IEEE JSAC (Journal of Selected Areas in Communications), Vol. 28, No. 4, pp. 612–619, May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''flow-based''' molecular communication, the molecules propagate through [[diffusion]] in a fluidic medium whose flow and [[turbulence]] are guided and predictable. The [[hormonal]] communication through blood streams inside the human body is an example of this type of propagation. The flow-based propagation can also be realized by using carrier entities whose motion can be constrained on the average along specific paths, despite showing a random component. A good example of this case is given by [[pheromone|pheromonal]] long range molecular communications.&lt;ref&gt;L. Parcerisa and [[Ian F. Akyildiz]], "Molecular Communication Options for Long Range Nanonetworks," Computer Networks Journal (Elsevier), Vol. 53, No. 16, pp. 2753–2766, November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''diffusion-based''' molecular communication, the molecules propagate through spontaneous diffusion in a fluidic medium. In this case, the molecules can be subject solely to the laws of diffusion or can also be affected by non-predictable turbulence present in the fluidic medium. Pheromonal communication, when pheromones are released into a fluidic medium, such as air or water, is an example of diffusion-based architecture. Other examples of this kind of transport include [[calcium signaling]] among cells &lt;ref&gt;M. T. Barros. "Ca2+-signaling-based molecular communication systems: design and future research directions". Elsevier Nano Communication Networks. vol 11, pp 103–113. 2017. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878778916300904] &lt;/ref&gt;, as well as [[quorum sensing]] among bacteria.&lt;ref name="TechReview"&gt;"The challenge of molecular communication", Technology Review (Physics arXiv blog), 28 June 2010.

Based on the macroscopic theory&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Berg (1993). Random Walks in Biology, Princeton University Press, NJ, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; of ideal (free) diffusion the impulse response of a unicast molecular communication channel was reported in a paper&lt;ref&gt;M.U.

Mouftah, "Characterization of Molecular Communication Channel for Nanoscale Networks," in Proc. 3rd International Conference on Bio-inspired Systems and Signal Processing (BIOSIGNALS-2010), Valencia, Spain, 20–23 January 2010, pp. 327–332. [http://www.biosignals.biostec.org/Abstracts/2010/BIOSIGNALS_2010_Abstracts.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; that identified that the impulse response of the ideal diffusion based molecular communication channel experiences temporal spreading. Such temporal spreading has a deep impact in the performance of the system e.g. in creating the intersymbol interference (ISI) at the receiving nanomachine.&lt;ref&gt;M.U. Mahfuz, D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1920">'''New Cinema History''' is a movement of media historians dedicated to rewriting film history as a social history of film cultures, instead of merely an art history of the moving image. The term was coined by Richard Maltby as "a body of work that focuses on the circulation and consumption of film and examines cinema as a site of social and cultural exchange."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/692084803|title=Explorations in new cinema history : approaches and case studies|last=1952-|first=Maltby, Richard,|last2=1962-|first2=Biltereyst, Daniël,|last3=Philippe.|first3=Meers,|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=|isbn=9781405199490|location=|pages=xii|oclc=692084803}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maltby's terminology partly aimed to institutionalize and expand to an international scale his prior decade-long collaboration with Melvyn Stokes researching Hollywood film audiences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41338511|title=Identifying Hollywood's audiences : cultural identity and the movies|last=Melvyn.|first=Stokes,|last2=1952-|first2=Maltby, Richard,|date=1999|publisher=British Film Institute|isbn=9780851707389|oclc=41338511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45306616|title=Hollywood spectatorship : changing perceptions of cinema audiences|last=Melvyn.|first=Stokes,|last2=1952-|first2=Maltby, Richard,|date=2001|publisher=BFI Pub|isbn=9780851708119|oclc=45306616}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/180880538|title=Going to the movies : Hollywood and the social experience of cinema|last=1952-|first=Maltby, Richard,|last2=Melvyn.|first2=Stokes,|last3=1950-|first3=Allen, Robert Clyde,|date=2007|publisher=University of Exeter Press|isbn=9780859898119|oclc=180880538}}&lt;/ref&gt; and coincided with the formation of the HoMER Network: History of Moviegoing, Exhibition and Reception.

'''Nutrient pollution,''' a form of [[water pollution]], refers to contamination by excessive inputs of nutrients. It is a primary cause of [[eutrophication]] of [[surface water]]s, in which excess nutrients, usually [[nitrogen]] or [[phosphorus]], stimulate [[algae|algal]] growth. Sources of nutrient pollution include [[surface runoff]] from farm fields and pastures, discharges from [[septic tank]]s and [[feedlot]]s, and [[air pollution|emissions]] from combustion. Excess nutrients have been summarized as potentially leading to:
* Population effects: excess growth of algae (blooms);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/harmful-algal-blooms |title=Harmful Algal Blooms |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-04-07 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Community effects: species composition shifts (dominant taxa); 
* Ecological effects: food web changes, light limitation; 
* Biogeochemical effects: excess organic carbon (eutrophication); dissolved oxygen deficits ([[hypoxia (environmental)|environmental hypoxia]]); toxin production;&lt;ref name="EPA envir effects"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/effects-environment |title=The Effects: Environment |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-04-07 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Human health effects: excess nitrate in drinking water ([[blue baby syndrome]]); disinfection by-products in drinking water;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/effects-human-health |title=The Effects: Human Health |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-10 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Biodiversity effects: excessive algae blooms ([[biodiversity loss]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrient-policy-data/national-nutrient-strategy |title=National Nutrient Strategy |publisher=EPA|date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) report, the agency's Science Advisory Board succinctly stated: “Excess [[reactive nitrogen]] compounds in the environment are associated with many large-scale environmental concerns, including eutrophication of surface waters, toxic algae blooms, hypoxia, acid rain, nitrogen saturation in forests, and global warming.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=EPA |title=Reactive Nitrogen in the United States: An Analysis of Inputs, Flows, Consequences, and Management Options, A Report of the Science Advisory Board EPA-SAB-11-013 |url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/67057225CC780623852578F10059533D/$File/EPA-SAB-11-013-unsigned.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219045824/http://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/67057225cc780623852578f10059533d/%24file/epa-sab-11-013-unsigned.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
[[File:Nutrient sources Gulf-Mex &amp; Chesbay - EPA 2010.png|thumb|Agriculture is the major source of nutrient pollution in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In the [[Chesapeake Bay]], agriculture is a major source, along with urban areas and atmospheric deposition.]]

===Nitrogen===
Use of [[synthetic fertilizer]]s, burning of [[fossil fuel]]s, and agricultural [[animal production]], especially [[concentrated animal feeding operation]]s (CAFO), have added large quantities of reactive nitrogen to the [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Galloway |first1=J.N. |last2=Dentener |first2=F.J. |display-authors=1 |date=September 2004 |title=Nitrogen Cycles: Past, Present, and Future |url= |journal=Biogeochemistry |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=153–226 |doi=10.1007/s10533-004-0370-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phosphorus===
Phosphorus pollution is caused by excessive use of fertilizers and [[manure]], particularly when compounded by [[soil erosion]]. Phosphorus is also discharged by municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants and some industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/phosphorus.html |title=Phosphorus and Water |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-03-13 |website=USGS Water Science School |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) |location=Reston, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land uses===
The principal source(s) of nutrient pollution in an individual [[drainage basin|watershed]] depend on the prevailing [[land use]]s. The sources may be [[Point source pollution|point sources]], [[Nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint sources]], or both:
* [[Agricultural pollution|Agriculture]]: animal production or crops
* Urban/suburban: [[Urban runoff|stormwater runoff]] from roads and parking lots; excessive fertilzer use on lawns; municipal sewage treatment plants; motor vehicle emissions
* Industrial: [[air pollution]] emissions (e.g. [[Thermal power station|electric power plants]]), wastewater discharges from various industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/sources-and-solutions |title=Sources and Solutions |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-10 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nutrient pollution from some air pollution sources may occur independently of the local land uses, due to long-range transport of air pollutants from distant sources.&lt;ref name="EPA envir effects"/&gt;

==Mitigation of nutrient pollutant discharges==
===United States===
Agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) pollution is the largest source of water quality impairments throughout the U.S., based on surveys by state environmental agencies.&lt;ref name="EPA 319 report"&gt;{{cite report |date=October 2016 |title=National Nonpoint Source Program: A catalyst for water quality improvements |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/319-grant-reports-and-project-summaries |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-R-16-009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} NPS pollution is not subject to discharge permits under the federal [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA).&lt;ref name="NPDES basic"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-basics |title=NPDES Permit Basics |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-07-25 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA and states have used grants, partnerships and demonstration projects to create incentives for farmers to adjust their practices and reduce [[surface runoff]].&lt;ref name="EPA 319 report"/&gt;{{rp|10-11}}

====Discharge permits====
Many [[point source pollution|point source]] dischargers in the U.S., while not necessarily the largest sources of nutrients in their respective watersheds, are required to comply with nutrient [[effluent limitation]]s in their permits, which are issued through the [[National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]] (NPDES), pursuant to the CWA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/status-nutrient-requirements-npdes-permitted-facilities |title=Status of Nutrient Requirements for NPDES-Permitted Facilities |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-06-08 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some large municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants, such as the [[Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant]] in Washington, D.C. have installed [[biological nutrient removal]] (BNR) systems to comply with regulatory requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dcwater.com/nitrogen-reduction |title=Removing Nitrogen from Wastewater Protects our Waterways |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |access-date=2018-01-15 |publisher=DC Water |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other municipalities have made adjustments to the operational practices of their existing [[secondary treatment]] systems to control nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/national-study-nutrient-removal-and-secondary-technologies |title=National Study of Nutrient Removal and Secondary Technologies |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-01-10 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discharges from large livestock facilities (CAFO) are also regulated by NPDES permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/animal-feeding-operations-afos |title=Animal Feeding Operations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-01-17 |website=NPDES |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surface runoff from farm fields, the principal source of nutrients in many watersheds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chesapeakebay.net/issues/agriculture |title=Agriculture |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Learn the Issues |publisher=Chesapeake Bay Program |location=Annapolis, Maryland |access-date=2018-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is classified as NPS pollution and is not regulated by NPDES permits.&lt;ref name="NPDES basic"/&gt;

====TMDL program====
A [[Total Maximum Daily Load]] (TMDL) is a regulatory plan that prescribes the maximum amount of a pollutant (including nutrients) that a body of water can receive while still meeting CWA water quality standards.&lt;ref name="TMDL overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/tmdl/program-overview-impaired-waters-and-tmdls |title=Overview of Identifying and Restoring Impaired Waters under Section 303(d) of the CWA |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-09-13 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Section 303 of the Act requires each state to generate a TMDL report for each body of water impaired by pollutants. TMDL reports identify pollutant levels and strategies to accomplish pollutant reduction goals. EPA has described TMDLs as establishing a "pollutant budget" with allocations to each of the pollutant's sources.&lt;ref name="water.epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web |title=Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDLs) at Work: New York: Restoring the Long Island Sound While Saving Money |url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/lawsguidance/cwa/tmdl/long_island_sound.cfm |publisher=EPA |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many coastal water bodies, the main pollutant issue is excess nutrients, also termed ''nutrient over-enrichment.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Golen |first=Richard F. |title=Incorporating Shellfish Bed Restoration into a Nitrogen TMDL Implementation Plan |date=2007 |url=http://www.coonamessettfarm.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/Incorporating_Shellfish_Bed_Restoration_into_Nitrogen_TMDL_Implementation_Plan.pdf |publisher=University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth |location=Dartmouth, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TMDL can prescribe the minimum level of [[dissolved oxygen]] (DO) available in a body of water, which is directly related to nutrient levels. (''See'' [[Hypoxia (environmental)#Aquatic hypoxia and Eutrophication|Aquatic Hypoxia]].) In 2010, 18 percent of TMDLs nationwide were related to nutrient levels including organic enrichment/oxygen depletion, noxious plants, algal growth, and ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=EPA|title=Water Quality Standards Academy|url=http://water.epa.gov/learn/training/standardsacademy/upload/module_nutrient.pdf|date=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TMDLs identify all point source and nonpoint source pollutants within a watershed. To implement TMDLs with point sources, wasteload allocations are incorporated into their NPDES permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-writers-manual |title=NPDES Permit Writers' Manual |chapter=Chapter 6.

In [[Long Island Sound]], the TMDL development process enabled the [[Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection]] and the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] to incorporate a 58.5 percent nitrogen reduction target into a regulatory and legal framework.&lt;ref name="water.epa.gov"/&gt;

==Nutrient remediation==
[[File:Mussels at Strawberry Rocks PC013145.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Mussels are examples of organisms that act as nutrient bioextractors&lt;/center&gt;]]Innovative solutions have been conceived to deal with nutrient pollution in aquatic systems by altering or enhancing natural processes to shift nutrient effects away from detrimental ecological impacts.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Nutrient remediation is a form of environmental remediation, but concerns only biologically active nutrients such as [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]. “Remediation” refers to the removal of pollution or contaminants, generally for the protection of human health. In [[environmental remediation]] nutrient removal technologies include [[biofiltration]], which uses living material to capture and biologically degrade pollutants. Examples include green belts, [[riparian]] areas, natural and constructed wetlands, and treatment ponds. These areas most commonly capture anthropogenic discharges such as wastewater, stormwater runoff, or sewage treatment, for land reclamation after mining, refinery activity, or land development.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Biofiltration utilizes [[Assimilation (biology)#Examples of biological assimilation|biological assimilation]] to capture, absorb, and eventually incorporate the pollutants (including nutrients) into living tissue. Another form of nutrient removal is [[bioremediation]], which uses microorganisms to remove pollutants. Bioremediation can occur on its own as natural attenuation or intrinsic bioremediation or can be encouraged by the addition of fertilizers, a strategy called biostimulation.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Nutrient bioextraction is bioremediation involving cultured plants and animals. Nutrient bioextraction or bioharvesting is the practice of farming and harvesting [[shellfish]] and [[seaweed]] for the purpose of removing nitrogen and other nutrients from natural water bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nutrient Bioextraction Overview |url=http://longislandsoundstudy.net/issues-actions/water-quality/nutrient-bioextraction-overview/ |publisher=Long Island Sound Study partnership |location=Stamford, CT |access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that nitrogen removal by oyster reefs could generate net benefits for sources facing nitrogen emission restrictions, similar to other nutrient trading scenarios. Specifically, if oysters maintain nitrogen levels in estuaries below thresholds that would lead to the imposition of emission limits, oysters effectively save the sources the compliance costs they otherwise would incur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kroeger |first=Timm |title=Dollars and Sense: Economic Benefits and Impacts from two Oyster Reef Restoration Projects in the Northern Gulf of Mexico |url=http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/oyster-restoration-study-kroeger.pdf|publisher=The Nature Conservancy|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have shown that [[oysters]] and [[mussels]] have the capacity to dramatically impact nitrogen levels in estuaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Comparative Roles of Suspension Feeders in Ecosystems, Vol. 47|year=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Netherlands|pages=93–120|author=Newell, R.I.E., Fisher, T.R., Holyoke, R.R., Cornwell, J.C.|edition=NATO Science Series IV: Earth and Environmental Sciences|contribution=Influence of eastern oysters on nitrogen and phosphorus regeneration in Chesapeake Bay, USA|editor=Dame, R., Olenin, S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grabowski,J.H., Petersen, C.H.|title=Restoring oyster reefs to recover ecosystem services|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier-Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|pages=281–298|edition=Ecosystem Engineers: Concepts, Theory and Applications|editor=Cuddington, K., Byers, J.E., Wilson, W.G., Hastings, A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Rose JM, Tedesco M, Wikfors GH, Yarish C |title=International Workshop on Bioextractive Technologies for Nutrient Remediation Summary Report|url=http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/nefsc/publications/|publisher=US Dept Commerce, Northeast Fish Sci Cent Ref Doc. 10-19; 12 p.

==History of nutrient policy in the United States==
The basic requirements for states to develop nutrient [[Clean Water Act#Water quality criteria|criteria]] and [[Clean Water Act#Water quality standards|standards]] were mandated in the 1972 Clean Water Act. Implementing this water quality program has been a major scientific, technical and resource-intensive challenge for both EPA and the states, and development is continuing well into the 21st century.

EPA published a wastewater management regulation in 1978 to begin to address the national nitrogen pollution problem, which had been increasing for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kilian |first1=Chris |title=Cracking down on Nutrient Pollution: CLF Fights to Bring New England's Coastal Waters Back to Life |journal=Conservation Matters |date=2010 |volume=16 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the agency published a ''National Nutrient Strategy'' with a focus on developing nutrient criteria.&lt;ref name="EPA-strategy"&gt;{{cite report |date=June 1998 |title=National Strategy for the Development of Regional Nutrient Criteria |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=20003NOU.txt |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 822-R-98-002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2000 and 2010 EPA published federal-level nutrient criteria for rivers/streams, lakes/reservoirs, estuaries and wetlands; and related guidance. "Ecoregional" nutrient criteria for 14 ecoregions across the U.S. were included in these publications. While states may directly adopt the EPA-published criteria, in many cases the states need to modfiy the criteria to reflect site-specific conditions. In 2004, EPA stated its expectations for numeric criteria (as opposed to less-specific narrative criteria) for total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), [[chlorophyll a]](chl-a), and clarity, and established "mutually-agreed upon plans" for state criteria development. In 2007, the agency stated that progress among the states on developing nutrient criteria had been uneven. EPA reiterated its expectations for numeric criteria and promised its support for state efforts to develop their own criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-08/documents/nutrient-memo-may252007.pdf |title=Nutrient Pollution and Numeric Water Quality Standards |author-last=Grumbles |author-first=Benjamin |date=2007-05-25 |publisher=EPA |id=Memorandum to State and Tribal Water Program Directors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 EPA published a progress report on state efforts to develop nutrient standards. A majority of states had not developed numeric nutrient criteria for rivers and streams; lakes and reservoirs; wetlands and estuaries (for those states that have estuaries).&lt;ref name="EPA-state adoption"&gt;{{cite report |title=State Adoption of Numeric Nutrient Standards (1998–2008) |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P1002TQ0.txt |date=December 2008 |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 821-F-08-007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, EPA also established a Nutrient Innovations Task Group (NITG), composed of state and EPA experts, to monitor and evaluate the progress of reducing nutrient pollution.&lt;ref name="EPA_programmatic"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrient-policy-data/programmatic-information-numeric-nutrient-water-quality-criteria |title=Programmatic Information on Numeric Nutrient Water Quality Criteria |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-05-16 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the NTIG issued a report, "An Urgent Call to Action," expesssing concern that water quality continued to deteriorate nationwide due to increasing nutrient pollution, and recommending more vigorous development of nutrient standards by the states.&lt;ref name="NTIG"&gt;{{cite report |date=August 2009 |title=An Urgent Call to Action: Report of the State-EPA Nutrient Innovations Task Group |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100U1TD.txt |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 800-R-09-032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 EPA reiterated the need for states to fully develop their nutrient standards, noting that [[Safe Drinking Water Act#Monitoring, compliance and enforcement|drinking water violations]] for nitrates had doubled in eight years, that half of all streams nationwide had medium to high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, and [[harmful algal bloom]]s were increasing. The agency set out a framework for states to develop priorities and watershed-level goals for reductions of nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/documents/memo_nitrogen_framework.pdf |title=Working in Partnership with States to Address Phosphorus and Nitrogen Pollution through Use of a Framework for State Nutrient Reductions |author-last=Stoner |author-first=Nancy K. |date=2011-03-16 |publisher=EPA |id=Headquarters Memorandum to EPA Regional Administrators}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrient trading==
After the EPA had introduced watershed-based [[NPDES]] permitting in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watershed-Based NPDES Permitting|url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/basics/Watershed-Based-NPDES-Permitting.cfm|publisher=EPA|accessdate=20 February 2015|date=20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; interest in nutrient removal and achieving regional TMDLs led to the development of nutrient trading schemes. Nutrient trading is a type of [[United States regulation of point source water pollution#Water quality trading|water quality trading]], a [[Market-based environmental policy instruments|market-based policy instrument]] used to improve or maintain water quality. Water quality trading arose around 2005 and is based on the fact that different pollution sources in a watershed can face very different costs to control the same pollutant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA Water Quality Trading Webcast Seminar |url=http://water.epa.gov/type/watersheds/trading.cfm|publisher=EPA|date=December 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water quality trading involves the voluntary exchange of pollution reduction credits from sources with low costs of pollution control to those with high costs of pollution control, and the same principles apply to nutrient water quality trading. The underlying principle is “polluter pays”, usually linked with a regulatory driver for participating is the trading program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Genevieve Bennett |author2=Nathaniel Carroll |author3=Katherine Hamilton |title=Charting New Waters, State of Watershed Payments 2012|url=http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/reports/sowp2012|publisher=Forest Trends}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A 2013 Forest Trends report summarized water quality trading programs and found three main types of funders: beneficiaries of watershed protection, polluters compensating for their impacts and ‘public good payers’ that may not directly benefit, but fund the pollution reduction credits on behalf of a government or [[NGO]]. As of 2013, payments were overwhelmingly initiated by public good payers like governments and NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Genevieve Bennett |author2=Nathaniel Carroll |author3=Katherine Hamilton |title=Charting New Waters State of Watershed Payments 2012Figure 4b: Watershed Investments by Payer Type, Globally, Excluding China|url=http://www.forest-trends.org/documents/files/doc_3308.pdf&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=QqnnVNmuHNGpyAT2wILoCA&amp;ved=0CAYQFjAB&amp;client=internal-uds-cse&amp;usg=AFQjCNG1eQccAysAnihOB89UutZMKp-K_g|publisher=Forest Trends Association|accessdate=20 February 2015|pages=98|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

== Nutrient source apportionment ==
Nutrient source apportionment is used to estimate the nutrient load from various sectors entering water bodies, following attenuation or treatment. [[Agriculture]] is typically the principal source of nitrogen in water bodies in Europe, whereas in many countries households and industries tend to be the dominant contributors of phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/607736796|title=Source apportionment of nitrogen and phosphorus inputs into the aquatic environment|date=2005|publisher=European Environment Agency|others=European Environment Agency.|isbn=9291677779|location=Copenhagen|oclc=607736796}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where [[water quality]] is impacted by excess nutrients, load source apportionment models can support the proportional and pragmatic management of water resources by identifying the pollution sources. There are two broad approaches to load apportionment modelling, (i) load-orientated approaches which apportion origin based on in-stream monitoring data&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=S.|last2=Taylor|first2=D.|last3=McElarney|first3=Y.R.|last4=Foy|first4=R.H.|last5=Jordan|first5=P.|title=An evaluation of catchment-scale phosphorus mitigation using load apportionment modelling|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0048969711001653|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=409|issue=11|pages=2211–2221|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.02.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grizzetti|first=B.|last2=Bouraoui|first2=F.|last3=Marsily|first3=G. de|last4=Bidoglio|first4=G.|title=A statistical method for source apportionment of riverine nitrogen loads|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2004.07.036|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume=304|issue=1-4|pages=302–315|doi=10.1016/j.jhydrol.2004.07.036}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (ii) source-orientated approaches where amounts of diffuse, or [[nonpoint source pollution]], emissions are calculated using models typically based on export coefficients from catchments with similar characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mockler|first=Eva M.|last2=Deakin|first2=Jenny|last3=Archbold|first3=Marie|last4=Daly|first4=Donal|last5=Bruen|first5=Michael|date=2016|title=Nutrient load apportionment to support the identification of appropriate water framework directive measures|jstor=10.3318/bioe.2016.22|journal=Biology and Environment: Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy|volume=116B|issue=3|pages=245–263|doi=10.3318/bioe.2016.22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=R.V.|last2=Jordan|first2=C.|last3=Annett|first3=J.A.|title=A phosphorus budget for Northern Ireland: inputs to inland and coastal waters|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2004.10.004|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume=304|issue=1-4|pages=193–202|doi=10.1016/j.jhydrol.2004.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Source Load Apportionment Model (SLAM) takes the latter approach, estimating the relative contribution of sources of nitrogen and phosphorus to surface waters in Irish catchments without in-stream monitoring data by integrating information on point discharges (urban wastewater, industry and septic tank systems), diffuse sources (pasture, arable, forestry, etc.), and catchment data, including hydrogeological characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mockler|first=Eva M.|last2=Deakin|first2=Jenny|last3=Archbold|first3=Marie|last4=Gill|first4=Laurence|last5=Daly|first5=Donal|last6=Bruen|first6=Michael|title=Sources of nitrogen and phosphorus emissions to Irish rivers and coastal waters: Estimates from a nutrient load apportionment framework|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.05.186|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=601-602|pages=326–339|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.05.186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:PDMS etching scheeme.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Figure 1 - Example of a procedure using ammonium fluoride as an etchant and [[polymer brush]]es for visualisation]]

'''Patterning by Etching at the nanoscale (PENs)''' is a [[soft lithography|soft lithographic]] technique in which the bonds in the [[polydimethylsiloxane]] (PDMS) matrix are broken to controlably etch PDMS (i.e. dissolve) at a slow rate along the outside of a PDMS channel formed with a patterned [[PDMS stamp]] applied to a surface.  The  channel in the stamp can be enlarged in the order of tens of [[nanometers]] to several [[micrometre]]s.  Exposing a fresh area of a surface that can be reacted with.

==Summary==
PDMS contains polymer chains of silicon-oxygen bonds, these bonds can be broken by [[fluoride]] containing species, in the same way that [[wafer (electronics)|silicon wafers]] are prepared by etching with [[hydrofluoric acid]], [[ammonium fluoride]] and related compounds.  By placing a PDMS stamp that contains a channel that can be externally filled on to a surface, that surface can be functionalised in the area of the channel.  By then running an etching solution through the channel, part of the PDMS will be removed.  Exposing a fresh area of the surface.  This can then be functionaliesd by appropriate chemistry.  The width of feature produced is controlled by etchant and time.

To apply this technique for the production of small patterned features it is necessary that the surface can be reacted to passivate it in the area exposed by the channel, followed by etching and then reacted in away that will only occur in the newly exposed area.

The advantages of photoalignment technique over conventional methods are non-contact high quality alignment, reversible alignment and micro-patterning of liquid crystal phases.

== History ==
Photoalignment was first demonstrated in 1988 by K. Ichimura on Quartz substrates with an [[azobenzene]] compound acting as the command surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ichimura|first=Kunihiro|last2=Suzuki|first2=Yasuzo|last3=Seki|first3=Takahiro|last4=Hosoki|first4=Akira|last5=Aoki|first5=Koso|date=September 1988|title=Reversible change in alignment mode of nematic liquid crystals regulated photochemically by command surfaces modified with an azobenzene monolayer|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la00083a030|journal=Langmuir|language=EN|volume=4|issue=5|pages=1214–1216|doi=10.1021/la00083a030|issn=0743-7463}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then several chemical combinations have been demonstrated for photoalignment and applied in production of liquid crystal devices like modern displays.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murata|first=Mitsuhiro|last2=Yokoyama|first2=Ryoichi|last3=Tanaka|first3=Yoshiki|last4=Hosokawa|first4=Toshihiko|last5=Ogura|first5=Kenji|last6=Yanagihara|first6=Yasuhiro|last7=Kusafuka|first7=Kaoru|last8=Matsumoto|first8=Takuya|date=May 2018|title=81-1: High Transmittance and High Contrast LCD for 3D Head-Up Displays|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sdtp.12126|journal=SID Symposium Digest of Technical Papers|language=en|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1088–1091|doi=10.1002/sdtp.12126|issn=0097-966X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Advantages ==
Traditionally, liquid crystals are aligned by rubbing electrodes on polymer covered glass substrates. Rubbing techniques are widely used in mass production of [[Liquid-crystal display|liquid crystal displays]] and small laboratories as well. Due to the mechanical contact during rubbing, often debris are formed resulting in impurities and damaged products. Also, static charge is generated by rubbing which can damage sensitive and increasingly miniature electronics in displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seki|first=Takahiro|date=2014-08-13|title=New strategies and implications for the photoalignment of liquid crystalline polymers|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/pj201468|journal=Polymer Journal|language=En|volume=46|issue=11|pages=751–768|doi=10.1038/pj.2014.68|issn=0032-3896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these problems can be addressed by photoalignment.

* Photoalignment is by definition a non-contact process. This allows alignment of liquid crystals even in mechanically inaccessible areas. This has immense implications in use of liquid crystals in telecommunications and organic electronics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* By optical imaging, very small domains can be aligned which results in extremely high quality alignments.
* By varying the orientation of liquid crystal alignment on a microscopic scale, thin film optical devices can be created like [[Lens (optics)|lens]], [[polarizer]], [[optical vortex]] generator, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pan|first=Su|last2=Ho|first2=Jacob Y.|last3=Chigrinov|first3=Vladimir G.|last4=Kwok|first4=Hoi Sing|date=2018-02-14|title=Novel Photoalignment Method Based on Low-Molecular-Weight Azobenzene Dyes and Its Application for High-Dichroic-Ratio Polarizers|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.8b00104|journal=ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces|language=en|volume=10|issue=10|pages=9032–9037|doi=10.1021/acsami.8b00104|issn=1944-8244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ji|first=Wei|last2=Wei|first2=Bing-Yan|last3=Chen|first3=Peng|last4=Hu|first4=Wei|last5=Lu|first5=Yan-Qing|date=2017-02-11|title=Optical field control via liquid crystal photoalignment|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F15421406.2016.1277314|journal=Molecular Crystals and Liquid Crystals|language=en|volume=644|issue=1|pages=3–11|doi=10.1080/15421406.2016.1277314|issn=1542-1406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quincha is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term widely known in [[Latin America]], borrowed from [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] ''qincha''&lt;ref&gt;Real Academia Española. http://www.rae.es/&lt;/ref&gt; (''kincha'' in [[Kichwa]]), which means "fence, wall, enclosure, corral, animal pen". Historically, this type of construction has been utilized in the [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colonies throughout the different regions of the [[Americas]].

Even though Spanish and Portuguese are closely related languages, in this case, the Portuguese equivalent is completely different: ''Pau-a-pique''.

==Biography==
Crist was a graduate of the former Messiah School (1916), now known as [[Messiah College]], [[Dickinson College]] (B.A., 1920) and [[Columbia University]] (Ph.D., 1925). Crist joined the faculty at Columbia University where he was a teacher and researcher from 1925 to 1941. He joined the [[Manhattan Project]] in 1941 and was among the leading scientists who developed the critical initial step of the separation of [[uranium]] [[isotope]]s. He was director of the Manhattan Project, Columbia University Group, 1945-6, after which he joined the [[Union Carbide Corporation]] in [[Charleston, West Virginia]], first as Manager of the Coal Hydrogenation Plant, and then as Director of Research of the Olefins Division.

Between 1959 and 1963, he was Director of the [[Union Carbide Research Institute]] at [[Tarrytown, New York]]. Crist turned to volunteer teaching in 1963, following the death of his beloved wife, Dorothy Lenhart Crist, formerly of New Cumberland. As a voluntary educator, Crist pursued his mission of introducing today's students, especially non-science majors, to the impact of science and technology on culture and the environment.

From 1963-1970, he taught at Dickinson College. There, he taught mostly upper level chemistry courses. However, his favorite course was on the [[history of science]]; it was a course for non-majors where he "helped students to understand some of the basic laws of the natural world around them."  In 1970, Crist was forced to resign due to the since repealed mandatory retirement age of 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Dr. Ray Crist, Class of 1920 |publisher=Dickinson College |year=2005 |url=http://www.dickinson.edu/news/features/2005/crist/ |accessdate=15 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910053845/http://www.dickinson.edu/news/features/2005/crist/ |archivedate=September 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1971 until his retirement in 2004, he continued his academic career at [[Messiah College]]. He taught mostly [[environmental chemistry]]  and was a major force behind the development of the Environmental Sciences program. During the final two decades of his work at Messiah, up to the age of 104, he worked on experiments involving [[adsorption]] of [[toxicity|toxic]] metals by plant material and the use of living plants for purifying the environment ([[phytoremediation]]). The results of these experiments appeared in twenty-seven journal articles and were reported at ten international conferences. Messiah professor of the history of science Edward B. Davis believes that he may have been the oldest publishing research scientist in history.

His academic achievements and his overcoming the challenges of aging were recognized by numerous events and awards such as America's Outstanding Older Worker (2002), the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series ''[[The Living Century]]'' in the episode "A Teacher and Student for Life", and the editorial "Phytoremediation's Centenarian" (International Journal of Phytoremediation, 2002), as well as extensive additional press and television coverage both in the United States and abroad. His memoir - Listening to Nature: My Century in Science (Seaburn Publications) - appeared in 2005. Crist died in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]] on July 23, 2005, at the age of 105.

A '''register file''' is an array of [[processor register]]s in a [[central processing unit]] (CPU). Modern [[integrated circuit]]-based register files are usually implemented by way of fast [[static RAM]]s with multiple ports.  Such RAMs are distinguished by having dedicated read and write ports, whereas ordinary multiported SRAMs will usually read and write through the same ports.

The [[instruction set architecture]] of a CPU will almost always define a set of registers which are used to stage data between memory and the functional units on the chip.  In simpler CPUs, these ''architectural registers'' correspond one-for-one to the entries in a physical register file (PRF) within the CPU.  More complicated CPUs use [[register renaming]], so that the mapping of which physical entry stores a particular architectural register changes dynamically during execution.&lt;ref name="cpurfreference"&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/25858039/A_Survey_of_Techniques_for_Designing_and_Managing_CPU_Register_File A Survey of Techniques for Designing and Managing CPU Register File]", Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  The register file is part of the [[instruction set architecture|architecture]] and visible to the programmer, as opposed to the concept of transparent [[CPU cache|caches]].

== Register bank switching ==
Register files may be clubbed together as register banks.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikibooks: Microprocessor Design/Register File#Register Bank]].
&lt;/ref&gt; Some processors have several register banks.

ARM processors use [[ARM architecture#Registers|ARM register banks]] for [[fast interrupt request]]. [[x86]] processors use context switching and fast interrupt for switching between instruction, decoder, GPRs and register files, if there is more than one, before the instruction is issued, but this is only existing on processors that support superscalar. However, context switching is a totally different mechanism to ARM's register bank within the registers.

The [[MODCOMP]] and the later [[Intel MCS-51#Registers|8051-compatible processors]] use bits in the program status word to select the currently active register bank.

== Implementation ==
[[Image:regfile array.png|right]]
The usual layout convention is that a simple array is read out vertically.  That is, a single word line, which runs horizontally, causes a row of [[bit cell]]s to put their data on bit lines, which run vertically.  [[Sense amplifier|Sense amps]], which convert low-swing read bitlines into full-swing logic levels, are usually at the bottom (by convention).  Larger register files are then sometimes constructed by tiling mirrored and rotated simple arrays.

Register files have one word line per entry per port, one bit line per bit of width per read port, and two bit lines per bit of width per write port.  Each bit cell also has a Vdd and Vss.  Therefore, the wire pitch area increases as the square of the number of ports, and the transistor area increases linearly.&lt;ref name="janssen" &gt;

2001.
p. 169.
p. 171-173.
&lt;/ref&gt;
At some point, it may be smaller and/or faster to have multiple redundant register files, with smaller numbers of read ports, rather than a single register file with all the read ports. The [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] [[R8000]]'s [[integer (computer science)|integer]] unit, for example, had a 9 read 4 write port 32 entry 64-bit register file implemented in a 0.7&amp;nbsp;µm process, which could be seen when looking at the chip from arm's length.

Two popular approaches to dividing registers into multiple register files are the distributed register file configuration and the partitioned register file configuration.&lt;ref name="janssen" /&gt;

In principle, any operation that could be done with a 64-bit-wide register file with many read and write ports could be done with a single 8-bit-wide register file with a single read port and a single write port. However, the [[bit-level parallelism]] of wide register files with many ports allows them to run much faster and thus, they can do operations in a single cycle that would take many cycles with fewer ports or a narrower bit width or both.&lt;ref name="cpurfreference"/&gt;

The width in bits of the register file is usually the number of bits in the [[Word (data type)|processor word size]].
Occasionally it is slightly wider in order to attach "extra" bits to each register, such as the poison bit.
If the width of the data word is different than the width of an address—or in some cases, such as the [[68000]], even when they are the same width—the address registers are in a separate register file than the data registers.

===Decoder===
* The decoder is often broken into pre-decoder and decoder proper.
* The decoder is a series of AND gates that drive word lines.
* There is one decoder per read or write port. If the array has four read and two write ports, for example, it has 6 word lines per bit cell in the array, and six AND gates per row in the decoder. Note that the decoder has to be pitch matched to the array, which forces those AND gates to be wide and short

===Array===
[[Image:regfile cell.png|right|frame| A typical register file -- "triple-ported", able to read from 2 registers and write to 1 register simultaneously -- is made of bit cells like this one.]]
The basic scheme for a bit cell:
* State is stored in pair of inverters. 
* Data is read out by nmos transistor to a bit line.
* Data is written by shorting one side or the other to ground through a two-nmos stack.
* So: read ports take one transistor per bit cell, write ports take four.
Many optimizations are possible:
* Sharing lines between cells, for example, Vdd and Vss.
* Read bit lines are often precharged to something between Vdd and Vss.
* Read bit lines often swing only a fraction of the way to Vdd or Vss.  A sense amplifier converts this small-swing signal into a full logic level.  Small swing signals are faster because the bit line has little drive but a great deal of parasitic capacitance.
* Write bit lines may be braided, so that they couple equally to the nearby read bitlines.  Because write bitlines are full swing, they can cause significant disturbances on read bitlines.
* If Vdd is a horizontal line, it can be switched off, by yet another decoder, if any of the write ports are writing that line during that cycle.  This optimization increases the speed of the write.
* Techniques that reduce the energy used by register files are useful in [[low-power electronics]]&lt;ref&gt;

==Microarchitecture==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}{{Cleanup|section|reason=poor English|date=June 2016}}Most register files make no special provision to prevent multiple write ports from writing the same entry simultaneously.  Instead, the instruction scheduling hardware ensures that only one instruction in any particular cycle writes a particular entry. If multiple instructions targeting the same register are issued, all but one have their write enables turned off.

The crossed inverters take some finite time to settle after a write operation, during which a read operation will either take longer or return garbage.  It is common to have bypass multiplexers that bypass written data to the read ports when a simultaneous read and write to the same entry is commanded.  These bypass multiplexers are often part of a larger bypass network that forwards results which have not yet been committed between functional units.

The register file is usually pitch-matched to the [[datapath]] that it serves.  Pitch matching avoids having many busses passing over the datapath turn corners, which would use a lot of area.  But since every unit must have the same bit pitch, every unit in the datapath ends up with the bit pitch forced by the widest unit, which can waste area in the other units.  Register files, because they have two wires per bit per write port, and because all the bit lines must contact the silicon at every bit cell, can often set the pitch of a datapath.

Area can sometimes be saved, on machines with multiple units in a datapath, by having two datapaths side-by-side, each of which has smaller bit pitch than a single datapath would have.  This case usually forces multiple copies of a register file, one for each datapath.

The [[Alpha 21264]] (EV6), for instance,  was the first large micro-architecture to implement "Shadow Register File Architecture". It had two copies of the integer register file and two copies of floating point register that locate in its front end (future and scaled file, each contain 2 read and 2 write port), and took an extra cycle to propagate data between the two during context switch.  The issue logic attempted to reduce the number of operations forwarding data between the two and greatly improved its integer performance and help reduce the impact of limited number of GPR in superscalar and speculative execution. The design was later adapted by [[SPARC]], [[MIPS Technologies|MIPS]] and some later x86 implementation.

The [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] uses multiple register file as well,  R8000 floating-point unit had two copies of the floating-point register file, each with four write and four read ports, and wrote both copies at the same time with context switch. However it does not support integer operation and integer register file still remain one. Later shadow register file was abandoned in newer design in favor of embedded market.

The [[SPARC]] uses "Shadow Register File Architecture" as well for its high end line, It had up to 4 copies of  integer register files (future, retired, scaled, scratched, each contain 7 read 4 write port) and 2 copies of floating point register file. but unlike Alpha and x86, they are locate in back end as retire unit right after its Out of Order Unit and renaming register files and do not load instruction during instruction fetch and decoding stage and context switch is needless in this design.

IBM uses the same mechanism as many major microprocessors, deeply merging the register file with the decoder but its register file are work independently by the decoder side and do not involve context switch, which is different from Alpha and x86. most of its register file not just serve for its dedicate decoder only but up to the thread level.  For example, [[POWER8]] has up to 8 instruction decoders, but up to 32 register files of 32 general purpose registers each (4 read and 4 write port), to facilitate [[simultaneous multithreading]], which its instruction cannot be used cross any other register file (lack of context switch.).

In the [[x86]] processor line, a typical pre-486 CPU did not have an individual register file, as all general purpose register were directly work with its decoder, and the x87 push stack was located within the floating-point unit itself. Starting with [[Pentium]], a typical Pentium-compatible x86 processor is integrated with one copy of the single-port architectural register file containing 8 architectural registers, 8 control registers, 8 debug registers, 8 condition code registers, 8 unnamed based register,{{clarify|date=September 2015}} one instruction pointer, one flag register and 6 segment registers in one file.

One copy of 8 x87 FP push down stack by default, [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]] register were virtually simulated from x87 stack and require x86 register to supplying MMX instruction and aliases to exist stack. On P6, the instruction independently can be stored and executed in parallel in early pipeline stages before decoding into [[micro-operations]] and renaming in out-of-order execution. Beginning with [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]], all register files do not require additional cycle to propagate the data, register files like architectural and floating point are located between code buffer and decoders, called "retire buffer", Reorder buffer and OoOE and connected within the ring bus (16&amp;nbsp;bytes). The register file itself still remains one x86 register file and one x87 stack and both serve as retirement storing. Its x86 register file increased to dual ported to increase bandwidth for result storage. Registers like debug/condition code/control/unnamed/flag were stripped from the main register file and placed into individual files between the micro-op ROM and instruction sequencer. Only inaccessible registers like the segment register are now separated from the general-purpose register file (except the instruction pointer); they are now located between the scheduler and instruction allocator, in order to facilitate register renaming and out-of-order execution. The x87 stack was later merged with the floating-point register file after a 128-bit XMM register debuted in Pentium III, but the XMM register file is still located separately from x86 integer register files.

Later P6 implementations (Pentium M, Yonah) introduced "Shadow Register File Architecture" that expanded to 2 copies of dual ported integer architectural register file and consist with context switch (between future&amp;retirered file and scaled file using the same trick that used between integer and floating point). It was in order to solve the register bottleneck that exist in x86 architecture after micro op fusion is introduced, but it is still have 8 entries 32&amp;nbsp;bit architectural registers for total 32 bytes in capacity per file (segment register and instruction pointer remain within the file, though they are inaccessible by program) as speculative file. The second file is served as a scaled shadow register file, which without context switch the scaled file cannot store some instruction independently. Some instruction from SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3 require this feature for integer operation, for example instruction like PSHUFB, PMADDUBSW, PHSUBW, PHSUBD, PHSUBSW, PHADDW, PHADDD, PHADDSW would require loading EAX/EBX/ECX/EDX from both of register file, though it was uncommon for x86 processor to take use of another register file with same instruction; most of time the second file is served as a scale retirered file. The Pentium M architecture still remains one dual-ported FP register file (8 entries MM/XMM) shared with three decoder and FP register does not have shadow register file with it as its Shadow Register File Architecture did not including floating point function. Processor after P6, the architectural register file are external and locate in processor's backend after retired, opposite to internal register file that are locate in inner core for register renaming/reorder buffer. However, in Core 2 it is now within a unit called "register alias table" RAT, located with instruction allocator but have same size of register size as retirement. [[Core (microarchitecture)|Core 2]] increased the inner ring bus to 24&amp;nbsp;bytes (allow more than 3 instructions to be decoded) and extended its register file from dual ported (one read/one write) to quad ported (two read/two write), register still remain 8 entries in 32&amp;nbsp;bit and 32&amp;nbsp;bytes (not including 6 segment register and one instruction pointer as they are unable to be access in the file by any code/instruction) in total file size and expanded to 16 entries in x64 for total 128&amp;nbsp;bytes size per file. From Pentium M as its pipeline port and decoder increased, but they're located with allocator table instead of code buffer. Its FP XMM register file are also increase to quad ported (2 read/2 write), register still remain 8 entries in 32&amp;nbsp;bit and extended to 16 entries in x64 mode and number still remain 1 as its shadow register file architecture is not including floating point/SSE functions.

In later x86 implementations, like [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]] and later processors, both integer and floating point registers are now incorporated into a unified octa-ported (six read and two write) general-purpose register file (8 + 8 in 32-bit and 16 + 16 in x64 per file), while the register file extended to 2 with enhanced "Shadow Register File Architecture" in favorite of executing [[hyper threading]] and each thread uses independent register files for its decoder. Later [[Sandy bridge]] and onward replaced shadow register table and architectural registers with much large and yet more advance physical register file before decoding to the reorder buffer. Randered that Sandy Bridge and onward no longer carry an architectural register.

On the [[Bonnell (microarchitecture)|Atom]] line was the modern simplified revision of P5. It includes single copies of register file share with thread and decoder. The register file is a dual-port design, 8/16 entries GPRS, 8/16 entries debug register and 8/16 entries condition code are integrated in the same file. However it has an eight-entries 64&amp;nbsp;bit shadow based register and an eight-entries 64&amp;nbsp;bit unnamed register that are now separated from main GPRs unlike the original P5 design and located after the execution unit, and the file of these registers is single-ported and not expose to instruction like scaled shadow register file found on Core/Core2 (shadow register file are made of architectural registers and Bonnell did not due to not have "Shadow Register File Architecture"), however the file can be use for renaming purpose due to lack of out of order execution found on Bonnell architecture. It also had one copy of XMM floating point register file per thread. The difference from [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]] is Bonnell do not have a unified register file and has no dedicated register file for its hyper threading. Instead, Bonnell uses a separate rename register for its thread despite it is not out of order. Similar to Bonnell, [[Larrabee (microarchitecture)|Larrabee]] and [[Xeon Phi]] also each have only one general-purpose integer register file, but the Larrabee has up to 16 XMM register files (8 entries per file), and the Xeon Phi has up to 128 AVX-512 register files, each containing 32 512-bit ZMM registers for vector instruction storage, which can be as big as L2 cache.

There are some other of Intel's x86 lines that don't have a register file in their internal design, [[MediaGX|Geode GX]] and [[Vortex86]] and many embedded processors that aren't [[Pentium]]-compatible or reverse-engineered early 80x86 processors. Therefore, most of them don't have a register file for their decoders, but their GPRs are used individually. [[NetBurst (microarchitecture)|Pentium 4]], on the other hand, does not have a register file for its decoder, as its x86 GPRs didn't exist within its structure, due to the introduction of a physical unified renaming register file (similar to Sandy Bridge, but slightly different due to the inability of Pentium 4 to use the register before naming) for attempting to replace the architectural register file and skip the x86 decoding scheme. Instead it uses SSE for integer execution and storage before the ALU and after result, SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3 use the same mechanism as well for its integer operation.

[[AMD]]'s early design like K6 do not have a register file like Intel and do not support "Shadow Register File Architecture" as its lack of context switch and bypass inverter that are necessary require for a register file to function appropriately. Instead they use a separate GPRs that directly link to a rename register table for its OoOE CPU with a dedicated integer decoder and floating decoder. The mechanism is similar to Intel's pre-Pentium processor line. For example, the [[AMD K6|K6]] processor has four int (one eight-entries temporary scratched register file + one eight-entries future register file + one eight-entries fetched register file + an eight-entries unnamed register file) and two FP rename register files (two eight-entries x87 ST file one goes fadd and one goes fmov) that directly link with its x86 EAX for integer renaming and XMM0 register for floating point renaming, but later [[AMD K7|Athlon]] included "shadow register" in its front end, it's scaled up to 40 entries unified register file for in order integer operation before decoded, the register file contain 8 entries scratch register + 16 future GPRs register file + 16 unnamed GPRs register file. In later AMD designs it abandons the shadow register design and favored to K6 architecture with individual GPRs direct link design. Like [[AMD Phenom|Phenom]], it has three int register files and two SSE register files that are located in the physical register file directly linked with GPRs. However, it scales down to one integer + one floating-point on [[Bulldozer (microarchitecture)|Bulldozer]]. Like early AMD designs, most of the x86 manufacturers like Cyrix, VIA, DM&amp;P, and SIS used the same mechanism as well, resulting in a lack of integer performance without register renaming for their in-order CPU. Companies like Cyrix and AMD had to increase cache size in hope to reduce the bottleneck. AMD's SSE integer operation work in a different way than Core 2 and Pentium 4; it uses its separate renaming integer register to load the value directly before the decode stage. Though theoretically it will only need a shorter pipeline than Intel's SSE implementation, but generally the cost of branch prediction are much greater and higher missing rate than Intel, and it would have to take at least two cycles for its SSE instruction to be executed regardless of instruction wide, as early AMDs implementations could not execute both FP and Int in an SSE instruction set like Intel's implementation did.

Unlike [[Alpha 21264|Alpha]], [[Sparc]], and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] that only allows one register file to load/fetch one operand at the time; it would require multiple register files to achieve superscale. The [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processor on the other hand does not integrate multiple register files to load/fetch instructions. ARM GPRs have no special purpose to the instruction set (the ARM ISA does not require accumulator, index, and stack/base points. Registers do not have an accumulator and base/stack point can only be used in thumb mode). Any GPRs can propagate and store multiple instructions independently in smaller code size that is small enough to be able to fit in one register and its architectural register act as a table and shared with all decoder/instructions with simple bank switching between decoders. The major difference between ARM and other designs is that ARM allows to run on the same general-purpose register with quick bank switching without requiring additional register file in superscalar. Despite x86 sharing the same mechanism with ARM that its GPRs can store any data individually, x86 will confront data dependency if more than three non-related instructions are stored, as its GPRs per file are too small (eight in 32&amp;nbsp;bit mode and 16 in 64&amp;nbsp;bit, compared to ARM's 13 in 32&amp;nbsp;bit and 31 in 64&amp;nbsp;bit) for data, and it is impossible to have superscalar without multiple register files to feed to its decoder (x86 code is big and complex compared to ARM). Because most x86's front-ends have become much larger and much more power hungry than the ARM processor in order to be competitive (example: Pentium M &amp; Core 2 Duo, Bay Trail). Some third-party x86 equivalent processors even became noncompetitive with ARM due to having no dedicated register file architecture. Particularly for AMD, Cyrix and VIA that cannot bring any reasonable performance without register renaming and out of order execution, which leave only Intel Atom to be the only in-order x86 processor core in the mobile competition. This was until the x86 Nehalem processor merged both of its integer and floating point register into one single file, and the introduction of a large physical register table and enhanced allocator table in its front-end before renaming in its out-of-order internal core.

== Register renaming ==
Processors that perform [[register renaming]] can arrange for each functional unit to write to a subset of the physical register file.  This arrangement can eliminate the need for multiple write ports per bit cell, for large savings in area.  The resulting register file, effectively a stack of register files with single write ports, then benefits from replication and subsetting the read ports.  At the limit, this technique would place a stack of 1-write, 2-read regfiles at the inputs to each functional unit.  Since regfiles with a small number of ports are often dominated by transistor area, it is best not to push this technique to this limit, but it is useful all the same.

== Register windows ==
The [[SPARC]] ISA defines [[register window]]s, in which the 5-bit architectural names of the registers actually point into a window on a much larger register file, with hundreds of entries.  Implementing multiported register files with hundreds of entries requires a large area.  The register window slides by 16 registers when moved, so that each architectural register name can refer to only a small number of registers in the larger array, e.g. architectural register r20 can only refer to physical registers #20, #36, #52, #68, #84, #100, #116, if there are just seven windows in the physical file.

To save area, some SPARC implementations implement a 32-entry register file, in which each cell has seven "bits".  Only one is read and writeable through the external ports, but the contents of the bits can be rotated.  A rotation accomplishes in a single cycle a movement of the register window.  Because most of the wires accomplishing the state movement are local, tremendous bandwidth is possible with little power.

This same technique is used in the [[R10000]] register renaming mapping file, which stores a 6-bit virtual register number for each of the physical registers.  In the renaming file, the renaming state is checkpointed whenever a branch is taken, so that when a branch is detected to be mispredicted, the old renaming state can be recovered in a single cycle.  (See [[Register renaming]].)
&lt;!-- To do: R10K map file had lots of ports and few bits of width, and so it used a different layout, with bit lines running parallel to word lines, and state bits being global wires running perpendicularly. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11618">'''Remediation of contaminated sites with cement''', also called '''solidification/stabilization with cement''' (S/S with cement) is a common method for the safe [[environmental remediation]] of [[contaminated]] land with [[cement]]. The cement solidifies the contaminated [[soil]] and prevents [[pollutant]]s from moving, such as [[rain]] causing leaching of pollutants into the [[groundwater]] or being carried into [[stream]]s by rain or [[snowmelt]]. Developed in the 1950s, the technology is widely used today to treat industrial [[hazardous waste]] and contaminated material at [[brownfield]] sites i.e. abandoned or underutilized properties that are not being redeveloped because of fears that they may be contaminated with [[hazardous waste]].&lt;ref name="http://www.pollutionengineering.com/PE/Home/Files/PDFs/PCA_S-S_Whitepaper.pdf" /&gt; S/S provides an economically viable means of treating contaminated sites. This technology treats and contains contaminated soil on site thereby reducing the need for [[landfill]]s.

==Process==
The Solidification/Stabilization method utilizes chemically reactive formulations that form stable solids that are non-hazardous or less-hazardous than the original materials.&lt;ref name= "http://www.sciencedirect.com"&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Malviya | first1 = R. | last2 = Chaudhary | first2 = R. | year = 2006 | title = Factors Affecting Hazardous Waste Solidification/Stabilization: A Review | url = | journal = Journal of Hazardous Materials | volume = 137 | issue = 1| pages = 267–276 | doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2006.01.065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solidification refers to the physical changes in the contaminated material when a certain binding agent is added. These changes include an increase in compressive strength, a decrease in permeability, and condensing of hazardous materials.&lt;ref name="http://www.pollutionengineering.com/PE/Home/Files/PDFs/PCA_S-S_Whitepaper.pdf"/&gt; Stabilization refers to the chemical changes between the stabilizing agent (binding agent) and the hazardous constituent. These changes should include a less soluble, less toxic constituent with hindered mobility.&lt;ref name= "http://www.frtr.gov/matrix2/section4/4-21.html" &gt; [http://www.frtr.gov/matrix2/section4/4-21.html 4.20 solidification/stabilization.] (n.d.).&lt;/ref&gt; Common bonding agents include, but are not limited to, [[portland cement]], lime, [[limestone]], [[fly ash]], [[slag]], [[clay]], and [[gypsum]]. Because of the vast types of hazardous materials, each agent should be tested on the site before a full-scale project is put under way. Most binding agents used are a blend of various single binding agents, depending on the hazardous material it will be used on. Portland cement has been used to treat more contaminated material than any other S/S binding agent because of its ability to bind free liquids, reduce permeability, encapsulate hazardous materials, and reduce the toxicity of certain contaminants. Lime can be used to adjust the pH of the substance of drive off water by using high heats of hydration. Limestone can also be used to adjust pH levels. Slag is often used for economical purposes because of its low cost.&lt;ref name="http://www.pollutionengineering.com/PE/Home/Files/PDFs/PCA_S-S_Whitepaper.pdf" /&gt;

==Different methods==

===In situ===
[[In situ]] is a Latin phrase meaning “in the place”. When referred to chemistry or chemical reactions it means “in the reaction mixture”. In situ S/S, accounting for 20% of S/S projects from 1982-2005, is used to mix binding agents into the contaminated material while remaining on the site. Outside benefits of in situ mixing include conserving transportation costs, no landfill usage, and lesser risk to surrounding communities to be exposed to the hazardous materials while in transport.&lt;ref name="http://www.pollutionengineering.com/PE/Home/Files/PDFs/PCA_S-S_Whitepaper.pdf"/&gt; In-situ mixing treatments can also have the added benefit of improving soil conditions on the site.&lt;ref name= "http://www.cement.org/waste/wt_ss.asp"&gt;[http://www.cement.org/waste/wt_ss.asp Solidification/stabilization.] (n.d.). Portland Cement Association&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ex situ===
Ex situ is a Latin phrase meaning “off site”.  In ex situ mixing, the hazardous materials are excavated, then machine-mixed with a certain bonding agent. This new, less-hazardous material is then deposited in a designated area, or reused on the initial site.&lt;ref name="http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/solidsta.htm"&gt;[http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/solidsta.htm Physical solidification/stabilization.] (2002, June). &lt;/ref&gt; From 1982-2005, ex-situ S/S technologies have accounted for 80% of the 217 projects that were completed.&lt;ref name="http://www.pollutionengineering.com/PE/Home/Files/PDFs/PCA_S-S_Whitepaper.pdf"/&gt;

==Limitations and concerns==
Prolonged use of the treated site and environmental and weather conditions may cause the materials used to stabilize the contaminants to erode, limiting the effect of the stabilization on the hazardous materials. Because of this, continuous monitoring of the site is required in order to ensure the contaminants have not re-assembled.&lt;ref name="http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/solidsta.htm"/&gt; Environmental factors such as freezing–thawing and wetting–drying were the focus of many studies dealing with the strength of S/S. It was found that freezing and thawing had the most adverse effects on the durability of the treated materials.&lt;ref name="http://www.sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

When dealing with a radioactive contaminant, the solidification process may be interfered by various other types of hazardous waste. Most S/S processes have little or limited effects on organics and pesticides. Only by destroying these wastes by heating at very high temperatures will organics and pesticides be immobilized.&lt;ref name="http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/solidsta.htm"/&gt; Prior to performing the process to these types of sites, treatability studies need to be conducted in order to conclude if the solidification/stabilization process will be beneficial.&lt;ref name="http://www.frtr.gov/matrix2/section4/4-21.html"/&gt; These cement processes can result in major volume changes to the site, often up to double its original volume.&lt;ref name="http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/solidsta.htm"/&gt;

==Projects==

===Sydney Tar Ponds===
The governments of Canada and the province of Nova Scotia agreed in January 2007 to clean up the infamous [[Sydney Tar Ponds]] contaminated site using S/S technology. Cement was mixed into the contaminated waste to solidify and stabilize it. When the S/S process was complete, the solidified areas were covered with an engineered cap consisting of a  clay, followed by layers of gravel and soil. Finally, the surface was planted with grass and other vegetation.&lt;ref name="http://www.tarpondscleanup.ca/index.php?sid=2&amp;cid=46"&gt;[http://www.tarpondscleanup.ca/index.php?sid=2&amp;cid=46 Tar ponds solidification/stabilization.] (n.d.).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former wood treating facility in Port Newark, New Jersey===
S/S technologies were used to treat a contaminated former wood treating facility in Port Newark, New Jersey. Approximately {{convert|8|acre|m2}} of soil was contaminated by wood with arsenic, chromium, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. 8% of Portland cement was used by wet weight of contaminated soil. Both in situ and ex situ processes were utilized to treat over 35,000 cubic meters of contaminated soil. The ex situ treated soil was mixed with Portland cement by a [[pugmill]] then placed on top of the in situ treated soil. This created an excellent base for pavement to be placed over the site. The proposed use for the treated site is a shipping container storage area.&lt;ref name="http://www.pollutionengineering.com/PE/Home/Files/PDFs/PCA_S-S_Whitepaper.pdf" &gt; Wilk, C. M. (n.d.). [http://www.pollutionengineering.com/PE/Home/Files/PDFs/PCA_S-S_Whitepaper.pdf Applying solidification/stabilization for sustainable redevelopment of contaminated property.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former electric generating station in Boston, Massachusetts===
Abandoned warehouses in Boston, Massachusetts are being renovated or torn down in order to build new structures. On this site is the former Central Power System, built in 1890. When built, this power station was considered to be the biggest electric generating plant in the world. This building has been abandoned since the 1950s and has not produced electricity in over 90 years. In the early 90s, renovations were started but were quickly shut down when free-floating oil was discovered in the sewers. Cleanup efforts were unsuccessful as they brought more oil onto the site. In 1999, cement-based S/S treatments were utilized to treat 2,100 cubic meters of contaminated materials. Lead and Petroleum contaminated soils were managed and treated successfully at this site.&lt;ref name="http://www.pollutionengineering.com/PE/Home/Files/PDFs/PCA_S-S_Whitepaper.pdf"/&gt;

===Dockside Green in Victoria British Columbia===
A {{convert|1300000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} complex of mixed residential, office, retail and commercial space is being built on {{convert|15|acre|m2}} of former industrial land in downtown Victoria that was contaminated by lead. 10 tonnes of soil was treated with cement, which was mixed into the soil on site simply by using an excavator bucket. The soil was thus rendered completely safe as was shown by tests on soil samples.

===Former battery breaking site in Brandon, Manitoba===
A 10,000 square metre lot formerly occupied by the Brandon Scrap Metal and Iron Company was chosen by the City of Brandon for the site for its new fire and police headquarters. For many years, lead cell batteries were destroyed there and the lead was extracted, leaving the untreated cases on site. An environmental assessment showed that the site was contaminated due to the presence of heavy metals, lead and hydrocarbon pollution. Cement based S/S was employed to successfully remediate 600 tonnes of contaminated soil.

===Skeet shooting range near St. Catharines, Ontario===
A vacant 5-hectare property near the Welland Canal in St. Catharines had surface soil containing dangerous concentrations of lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to a depth up to 0.4 m due the past operations of an adjacent skeet shooting range. About 26,000 tonnes of soil were treated using S/S to bring the contamination levels below the Ontario Land Disposal Regulations criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceaa.gc.ca/052/details-eng.cfm?pid=36742 Soil Remediation- Surplus Seaway Property- St. Catharines, Ontario], Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sales engineering''' is a hybrid of [[sales]] and [[engineering]] that exists in industrial and commercial markets. Buying decisions in these markets are made differently than those in many consumer contexts, being based more on technical information and rational analysis and less on style, [[fashion]], or [[impulse purchase|impulse]]. Therefore, [[selling]] in these markets cannot depend on consumer-type sales methods alone, and instead it relies heavily on technical information and problem-solving to convince buyers that they should spend money on the seller's products or services, in order to meet a business need (that is, to satisfy a [[business case]]). A '''sales engineer''' is thus both "a salesperson that understands and can apply engineering" and "an engineer that understands how to sell engineered systems". They thus not only sell but also provide advice and support. They provide this service to various internal or external customers, and they may work for a [[manufacturing|manufacturer]] (servicing its industrial-account/[[business-to-business]] customers), for a [[distribution (business)|distributor]] (which in turn services the industrial-account/[[business-to-business]] customers), or for a third party such as an engineering [[consultant|consultancy]] or a [[systems integrator]].

Sales Engineers are a critical sales team member in many companies and industries around the world.  They are more than just technical experts in their respective industries.  Highly successful sales engineers must build and maintain parallel expertise in "soft skill" disciplines such as business acumen, presentation skills, building customer relationships, developing an engagement strategy, and having a thorough understanding of the targeted industry.  Many companies have difficulty finding people who possess these qualities, plus have extensive technical knowledge. 

The essence of the sales engineering role can be called by various names. Which name is most apt can even depend on which industry it is used in.&lt;ref name="thesalesengineer.com_whats-in-a-name"&gt;{{Citation |last=Mourer |first=Darrin |date=2008-03-27 |title=What's in a name? |website=TheSalesEngineer.com |url=http://www.thesalesengineer.com/2008/03/27/whats-in-a-name/ |accessdate=2013-05-03 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some common job titles that involve the essence of sales engineering include '''sales engineer''', '''solutions engineer''', '''systems engineer''', '''customer engineer''', '''pre-sales consultant''', '''technical account manager''',&lt;ref name="thesalesengineer.com_whats-in-a-name"/&gt; '''applications engineer''' or '''field applications engineer'''. The term [[systems engineering]] has various shades of meaning, however, as it is often more or less synonymous with [[industrial engineering]]; but in any market economy, industrial engineers will often end up providing some sales engineering as a necessary portion of their work. [[Technician|Service technician]]s in industrial fields may also find that their work challenges them to provide some sales engineering, to whatever extent they are capable of providing it, because they interface with customers having problems with equipment (or lacking the right equipment) and seeking solutions (anywhere from diagnosis and repair, to identifying entirely different systems that could be used instead).

The purpose of the job is to help potential customers understand, compare, and contrast the solutions that are available for buying (the '''pre-sales role'''); to troubleshoot problems with their implementations—that is, to help ensure that the solutions work successfully once the buying decision has been made (the '''post-sales role'''); and to maximize sales for the sales engineer's employer by providing such help to the customers (the aspect of the job that puts the "sales" in the title '''sales engineer''').

==== Conflict-of-interest management and return-on-investment demonstration====
It is understood in the market, by both the sales engineer and his or her wary industrial client, that the sales portion of the sales engineering role inherently involves [[conflict of interest]] (COI), because it is always possible that the ''ideal'' solutions and troubleshooting could involve recommending a competitor's products or services, yet the sales engineer is under pressure not to steer the customer in that direction, and, conversely, to find reasons to steer them toward the employer's products. Thus, customers weigh the advice of sales engineers with a predisposition of [[caveat emptor]]. Nevertheless, sales engineers do usually provide real [[value (economics)|value]] to customers, which is why the role can endure despite the customers' perennial taking of a [[grain of salt]]. The customer's only motivation to participate in the encounter is to achieve [[return on investment]] (ROI) in one way or another. Toward that end, sales engineering increasingly relies on any information technology that can help quantify ROI even from the first encounter.&lt;ref name="PM_Blog_"&gt;{{Citation |last=Koepfer |first=Chris |date=2013-04-26 |title=Mobile Device App Acts as Sales Tool |journal=''Production Machining'' editorial staff blog |url=http://www.productionmachining.com/blog/post/mobile-device-app-acts-as-sales-tool- |accessdate=2013-05-03 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is summed up in the aphorism that "at the end of the day, the customer just wants to know for sure that they will gain A dollars over the next B years (via reduced expenses or increased sales) if they pay C dollars up front for product D."

=== Application development ===
Another function of the sales engineer is to introduce modified, improved, and/or advanced technology to potential users who may have an application but who have not yet acquired knowledge of the material or technique in question. The sales engineer may conduct training sessions or demonstrations to accomplish this. The task of seeking out industries, firms, or business models that do not yet use a certain product (for example, a [[computer-aided technologies|CAx]] system or a [[customer relationship management|CRM]] system) and causing them to adopt a new approach using that product is what puts the "applications" in "applications engineering" or "application development" (not to be confused with another common sense of that term, which refers to [[software development]] and programming). The task is to seek out and develop new applications for the product, in order to increase sales. The customer's only motivation for adopting it is "what it can do for me", such as same-output-lower-costs, more-output-same-cost, etc. Thus, when things work out correctly, both firms profit from the application development.

This result also has broader economic implications, as it is a mechanism by which [[economic efficiency]] increases, [[productivity]] grows, and [[economic growth]] is encouraged. Inventors and [[research and development|R&amp;D]] people create new tools and processes; but they do not disseminate into the business world (to do any economic good) without some amount of applications development, teaching (from exposing decision-makers via [[trade show]]s to providing workers with training), and sales.

=== Teaching customers ===
Many products and services purchased by large companies and institutions are highly complex. Examples include airliners, weapons systems, and [[information technology|IT systems]] (such as telecommunications, or databases and their dependent applications for purposes such as [[logistics]] or [[customer relationship management]]). Sales engineers advise customers on how best to use the products or services provided.

The sales process also may require some technical [[proof of concept]] or [[tech demo]] to be assured of the practicality of the solution.  Sales engineers normally will ensure these efforts are successful.

=== Tailoring solutions ===
Sales engineers also collaborate with the design, production, engineering, or [[research and development|R&amp;D]] departments of their companies to determine how products and services could be made or modified to suit customers' needs. This aspect of sales engineering is important, because it is what allows the sales engineer to feel that they can maintain their personal integrity (ethically speaking) in the face of the inherent COI of the job (explained earlier). The sales engineer does not have to lie (ignore or negatively misrepresent the competitor's products or services) if they can reasonably tell the customer that their employer can tailor its solutions to the customer's particular requirements. Doing that may not be easy or cheap, which means that there is always a line to be walked to avoid overpromising-and/or-underdelivering.

== Personnel considerations ==

=== Talents, skills, knowledge ===
The companies that employ sales engineers need to sell their products or services to generate income, but since engineers and scientists usually have substantially different personality traits than those required for sales work, there is a role for people with a combination of abilities. These individuals must have technical understanding of the complexities of what their company supplies together with sales skills. This combination of traits is not common.

=== Travel, communications, telepresence, compensation ===
Sales engineers may spend 20% to 70% of their time traveling, and they may work a flexible schedule due to the needs of the sales organization they support. Most sales engineers telecommute or spend a limited amount of time in the office. Skills with IT that help remote people communicate better, such as [[teleconferencing]], [[videoconferencing]], [[web conferencing]], and [[telepresence]] (e.g., [[GoToMeeting]], [[WebEx]], [[Live Meeting]], [[Fuze Meeting]]) are put to good use both on and off the road.

Sales engineers, like their [[sales]] representative counterparts, are hired based on their geographic location rather than their proximity to the corporate, or even regional, office. Working in another part of the country, or even outside the country, where the corporate offices are, a sales engineer may only make it to corporate headquarters once or twice each year.

A key differentiator between sales engineers and other roles within the organization is that a sales engineer is usually compensated by salary plus commission, as most sales representatives are. This commission is usually paid out when the sales representative is paid. Far less common is the case where a sales engineer is compensated with a base salary plus bonus. The bonus can be based upon the revenue generated within an assigned territory, set up as a [[Management by objectives|Management By Objective]] (MBO) bonus, or a combination of the two.&lt;ref&gt;Mourer, D., 2008, [http://www.thesalesengineer.com/2008/12/02/sales-engineer-mbos/ Sales Engineer MBOs], thesalesengineer.com&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases a sales engineer will make a base salary that is proportionally higher than their sales representative counterparts, and significantly more than the traditional engineers in an organization.

=== Sales engineering resources ===
Sales engineering is different from traditional sales roles. The systems and technology that a sales engineer sells are often complex and expensive. Traditional sales strategies including closing techniques, do not typically work and can even hurt a sale. As technology advances, so must the sales strategy of a sales engineer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18981">The '''salt spray (or salt fog) test''' is a standardized and popular [[corrosion]] test method, used to check corrosion resistance of materials and surface [[coating]]s. Usually, the materials to be tested are [[metal]]lic (although stone, ceramics, and polymers may also be tested) and finished with a surface coating which is intended to provide a degree of [[corrosion]] protection to the underlying metal. 
Salt spray testing is an accelerated corrosion test that produces a corrosive attack to coated samples in order to evaluate (mostly comparatively) the suitability of the coating for use as a protective finish. The appearance of corrosion products ([[rust]] or other oxides) is evaluated after a pre-determined period of time. Test duration depends on the corrosion resistance of the coating; generally, the more corrosion resistant the coating is, the longer the period of testing before the appearance of corrosion/ rust.
The salt spray test is one of the most widespread and long established corrosion tests. [[ASTM]] B117 was the first internationally recognized salt spray standard, originally published in 1939. Other important relevant standards are [[ISO]]9227, [[Japanese Industrial Standards|JIS]] Z 2371 and [[ASTM]] G85.

== Application ==
Salt spray testing is popular because it is relatively inexpensive, quick, well standardized, and reasonably repeatable. Although there may be a weak correlation between the duration in salt spray test and the expected life of a [[coating]] in certain coatings such as  hot dip [[galvanized steel]], this test has gained worldwide popularity due to low cost and quick results. Most Salt Spray Chambers today are being used NOT to predict the corrosion resistance of a coating, but to maintain coating processes such as pre-treatment and painting, electroplating, galvanizing, and the like, on a comparative basis. For example, pre-treated + painted components must pass 96 hours Neutral Salt Spray, to be accepted for production. Failure to meet this requirement implies instability in the chemical process of the pre-treatment, or the paint quality, which must be addressed immediately, so that the upcoming batches are of the desired quality. The longer the accelerated corrosion test, the longer the process remains out of control, and larger is the loss in the form of non-conforming batches.
The principle application of the salt spray test is therefore enabling quick comparisons to be made between actual and expected [[corrosion resistance]]. Most commonly, the time taken for [[oxides]] to appear on the samples under test is compared to expectations, to determine whether the test is passed or failed. For this reason the salt spray test is most often deployed in a quality audit role, where, for example, it can be used to check the effectiveness of a production process, such as the surface coating of a metallic part.
The salt spray test has little application in predicting how materials or surface coatings will resist [[corrosion]] in the real-world, because it does not create, replicate or accelerate real-world corrosive conditions. [[Cyclic corrosion testing]] is better suited to this.

== Testing equipment ==
[[Image:SS cabinet.jpg|thumb|A salt spray cabinet]]

The apparatus for testing consists of a closed testing cabinet/chamber, where a salt water (5% NaCl) solution is atomized by means of spray nozzle(s) using pressurized air. This produces a [[corrosive]] environment of dense salt water fog (also referred to as a mist or spray) in the chamber, so that test samples exposed to this environment are subjected to severely corrosive conditions. Chamber volumes vary from supplier to supplier. If there is a minimum volume required by a particular salt spray test standard, this will be clearly stated and should be complied with. There is a general historical consensus that larger chambers can provide a more homogeneous testing environment.

Variations to the salt spray test solutions depend upon the materials to be tested. The most common test for steel based materials is the Neutral Salt Spray test (often abbreviated to NSS) which reflects the fact that this type of test solution is prepared to a neutral pH of 6.5 to 7.2. Results are represented generally as testing hours in NSS without appearance of corrosion products (e.g. 720 h in NSS according to ISO 9227). Synthetic seawater solutions are also commonly specified by some companies and standards.  Other test solutions have other [[chemicals]] added including [[acetic acid]] (often abbreviated to ASS) and acetic acid with [[copper chloride]] (often abbreviated to CASS) each one chosen for the evaluation of decorative coatings, such as electroplated copper-nickel-chromium, electroplated copper-nickel or anodized [[aluminum]]. These acidified test solutions generally have a pH of 3.1 to 3.3

Some sources do not recommend using ASS or CASS test cabinets interchangeably for NSS tests, due to the risk of cross-[[contamination]], it is claimed that a thorough cleaning of the cabinet after CASS test is very difficult. [[ASTM]] does not address this issue, but [[ISO]] 9227 does not recommend it and if it is to be done, advocates a thorough cleaning.

Although the majority of salt spray tests are continuous, i.e.; the samples under test are exposed to the continuous generation of salt fog for the entire duration of the test, a few do not require such exposure. Such tests are commonly referred to as modified salt spray tests. ASTM G85 is an example of a test standard which contains several modified salt spray tests which are variations to the basic salt spray test.

== Modified Salt Spray Tests ==

[[ASTM]] G85 is the most popular global test standard covering modified salt spray tests. There are five such tests altogether, referred to in ASTM G85 as annexes A1 through to A5.[[File:Salt Spray Chamber.jpg|thumb|A modified salt spray chamber in use]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/G85.htm|title=ASTM G85 - 11 Standard Practice for Modified Salt Spray (Fog) Testing|author=|date=|website=www.astm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these modified tests originally arose within particular [[industry sector]], in order to address the need for a [[corrosion]] test capable of replicating the effects of naturally occurring corrosion and accelerate these effects.
This acceleration arises through the use of chemically altered salt spray solutions, often combined with other test climates and in most cases, the relatively rapid cycling of these test climates over time. Although popular in certain industries, modified salt spray testing has in many cases been superseded by [[Cyclic corrosion testing]] (CCT) 
The type of [[environmental test chambers]] used for modified salt spray testing to ASTM G85 are generally similar to the chambers used for testing to [[ASTM B117]], but will often have some additional features, such as an automatic climate cycling control system.

[[File:ASTM G85 Annex 1.jpg|thumb|left|Graph showing the temperature &amp; humidity steps required during modified Salt Spray Test ASTM G85 Annex 1]]

'''ASTM G85 annex A1 – Acetic Acid Salt Spray Test (non-cyclic)''' 
This test can be used to determine the relative resistance to corrosion of decorative [[chromium plating]] on [[steel]] and [[zinc]] based [[die casting]] when exposed to an [[acetic acid]] salt spray climate at an elevated temperature. This test is also referred to as an ASS test.
Test specimens are placed in an enclosed chamber and exposed to a continuous indirect spray of salt water solution, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the test standard and acidified (to pH 3.1 to 3.3) by the addition of acetic acid. This spray is set to fall-out on to the specimens at a rate of 1.0 to 2.0ml/80&amp;nbsp;cm²/hour, in a chamber temperature of +35C. This climate is maintained under constant steady state conditions. The test duration is variable.&lt;ref name="ASTM G85"&gt;{{cite book|last1=al.|first1=Robert Baboian, editor ; section editors, Robert Baboian ... et|title=Corrosion tests and standards : application and interpretation|date=2004|publisher=ASTM International|location=West Conshohocken, PA|isbn=0803120982|pages=132–134|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ASTM G85 Annex 2.jpg|thumb|left|Graph showing the temperature &amp; humidity steps required during modified Salt Spray Test ASTM G85 Annex 2]]

'''ASTM G85 annex A2 – Acidified Salt Fog Test (cyclic).'''

This test can be used to test the relative resistance to corrosion of [[aluminium]] alloys when exposed to a changing climate of acetic acid salt spray, followed by air drying, followed by high humidity, all at an elevated temperature. This test is also referred to as a MASTMAASIS test.
Test specimens are placed in an enclosed chamber, and exposed to a changing climate that comprises the following 3 part repeating cycle. 0.75 hours exposure to a continuous indirect spray of salt water solution, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the test standard and acidified (to pH 2.8 to 3.0) by the addition of acetic acid. This spray is set to fall-out on to the specimens at a rate of 1.0 to 2.0ml/80&amp;nbsp;cm²/hour. This is followed by 2.0 hours exposure to an air drying (purge) climate. This is followed by 3.25 hours exposure to a high humidity climate which gradually rises to between 65%RH and 95%RH. The entire test cycle is at a constant chamber temperature of +49C. The number of cycle repeats and therefore the test duration is variable.&lt;ref name="ASTM G85"/&gt;

[[File:ASTM G85 Annex 3.jpg|thumb|left|Graph showing the temperature &amp; humidity steps required during modified Salt Spray Test ASTM G85 Annex 3]]

'''ASTM G85 annex A3 – Seawater Acidified Test (cyclic)'''

This test can be used to test the relative resistance to corrosion of coated or uncoated aluminium alloys and other metals, when exposed to a changing climate of acidified [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] seawater spray, followed by a high humidity, both at an elevated temperature. This test is also referred to as a SWAAT test.
Test specimens are placed in an enclosed chamber, and exposed to a changing climate that comprises the following 2 part repeating cycle. 30 minutes exposure to a continuous indirect spray of synthetic seawater solution, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the test standard and acidified (to pH 2.8 to 3.0) by the addition of acetic acid. This spray is set to fall-out on to the specimens at a rate of 1.0 to 2.0ml/80&amp;nbsp;cm²/hour. This is followed by 90 minutes exposure to a high humidity climate of above 98%RH. The entire test cycle is at a constant chamber temperature of +49C (may be reduced to +24 to +35C for organically coated specimens). The number of cycle repeats and therefore the test duration is variable.&lt;ref name="ASTM G85"/&gt;

[[File:ASTM G85 Annex 4A.jpg|thumb|left|Graph showing the temperature &amp; humidity steps required during modified Salt Spray Test ASTM G85 Annex 4A]]
[[File:Illustration of a chamber undergoing Modified Salt Spray Test ASTM G85 Annex A4.jpg|thumb|An example of modified salt spray test ASTM G85 annex A4 – SO2 Salt Spray Test]]

'''ASTM G85 annex A4 – SO2 Salt Spray Test (cyclic)'''

This test can be used to test the relative resistance to corrosion of product samples that are likely to encounter a combined SO2([[sulfur dioxide]])/salt spray/acid rain environment during their usual service life.
Test specimens are placed in an enclosed chamber, and exposed to 1 of 2 possible changing climate cycles. In either case, the exposure to salt spray may be salt water spray or synthetic sea water prepared in accordance with the requirements of the test standard. The most appropriate test cycle and spray solutions are to be agreed between parties.

The first climate cycle comprises a continuous indirect spray of neutral (pH 6.5 to 7.2) salt water/synthetic seawater solution, which falls-out on to the specimens at a rate of 1.0 to 2.0ml/80&amp;nbsp;cm²/hour. During this spraying, the chamber is dosed with SO2 gas at a rate of 35&amp;nbsp;cm³/minute/m³ of chamber volume, for 1 hour in every 6 hours of spraying. The entire test cycle is at a constant chamber temperature of +35C. The number of cycle repeats and therefore the test duration is variable.

The second climate cycle comprises 0.5 hours of continuous indirect spray of neutral (pH 6.5 to 7.2) salt water/synthetic seawater solution, which falls-out on to the specimens at a rate of 1.0 to 2.0ml/80&amp;nbsp;cm²/hour. This is followed by 0.5 hours of dosing with SO2 gas at a rate of 35&amp;nbsp;cm³/minute/m³ of chamber volume. This is followed by 2.0 hours of high humidity soak. The entire test cycle is at a constant chamber temperature of +35C. The number of cycle repeats and therefore the test duration is variable.&lt;ref name="ASTM G85"/&gt;
[[File:ASTM G85 Annex 5.jpg|thumb|left|Graph showing the temperature &amp; humidity steps required during modified Salt Spray Test ASTM G85 Annex 5]]

'''ASTM G85 annex A5 - Dilute Electrolyte Salt Fog/Dry Test (cyclic)'''

This test can be used to test the relative resistance to corrosion paints on [[steel]], when exposed to a changing climate of dilute salt spray at ambient temperature, followed by air drying at and elevated temperature. It is a popular test in the surface coatings industry, where it is also referred to as the PROHESION™ test.
Test specimens are placed in an enclosed chamber, and exposed to a changing climate that comprises the following 2 part repeating cycle. 1.0 hour exposure to a continuous indirect spray of salt water solution, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the test standard and acidified (to pH 3.1 to 3.3) by the addition of acetic acid. This spray is set to fall-out on to the specimens at a rate of 1.0 to 2.0ml/80&amp;nbsp;cm²/hour, in an ambient chamber temperature (21 to 27C). This is followed by 1.0 hour exposure to an air drying (purge) climate, in a chamber temperature of +35C. The number of cycle repeats and therefore the test duration is variable.&lt;ref name="ASTM G85"/&gt;

== Standardization ==
[[Image:Whiterust.jpg|thumb|Electroplated and yellow chromated bolt with white corrosion]]
[[Image:Redrust.jpg|thumb|Zinc flake coated bolt with red rust after testing]]

Chamber construction, testing procedure and testing parameters are standardized under national and international standards, such as ASTM B&amp;nbsp;117 and ISO 9227. These standards describe the necessary information to carry out this test; testing parameters such as temperature, air pressure of the sprayed solution, preparation of the spraying solution, concentration, [[pH]], etc. Daily checking of testing parameters is necessary to show compliance with the standards, so records shall be maintained accordingly. ASTM B117 and ISO 9227 are widely used as reference standards. Testing cabinets are manufactured according to the specified requirements here. 

However, these testing standards neither provide information of testing periods for the coatings to be evaluated, nor the appearance of corrosion products in form of salts. Requirements are agreed between customer and manufacturer. In the automotive industry requirements are specified under material specifications. Different coatings have different behavior in salt spray test and consequently, test duration will differ from one type of coating to another. For example, a typical electroplated zinc and [[Zinc yellow|yellow passivated steel]] part lasts 96 hours in salt spray test without [[wet storage stain|white rust]]. Electroplated zinc-nickel steel parts can last more than 720 hours in NSS test without red rust (or 48 hours in CASS test without red rust) Requirements are established in test duration (hours) and coatings shall comply with minimum testing periods.

[[Artificial seawater]] which is sometimes used for Salt Spray Testing can be found at [[ASTM International]]. The standard for Artificial Seawater is ASTM D1141-98 which is the standard practice for the preparation of substitute ocean water.

== Uses ==
Typical coatings that can be evaluated with this method are:

*Phosphated (pre-treated) surfaces (with subsequent paint/primer/lacquer/rust preventive)
*[[Zinc]] and zinc-alloy plating (see also [[electroplating]]). See ISO 4042 for guidance
*Electroplated [[chromium]], [[nickel]], [[copper]], [[tin]]
*Coatings not applied electrolytically, such as zinc flake coatings according to ISO 10683
*Organic coatings, such as rust preventives
*Paint Coating

Hot-dip galvanized surfaces are not generally tested in a salt spray test (see ISO 1461 or ISO 10684). [[Hot-dip galvanizing]] produces zinc [[carbonates]] when exposed to a natural environment, thus protecting the coating metal and reducing the corrosion rate. The zinc carbonates are not produced when a hot-dip galvanized specimen is exposed to a salt spray fog, therefore this testing method does not give an accurate measurement of corrosion protection. ISO 9223 gives the guidelines for proper measurement of corrosion resistance for hot-dip galvanized specimens.

Painted surfaces with an underlying hot-dip galvanized coating can be tested according to this method. See ISO 12944-6.

Testing periods range from a few hours (e.g. 8 or 24 hours of phosphated steel) to more than a month (e.g. 720 hours of zinc-nickel coatings, 1000 hours of certain zinc flake coatings).

The National Industries for the Blind (NIB) incorporated as a [[nonprofit organization]] on August 10, 1938,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nib.org/about-us/history|title=History|last=|first=|date=|website=National Industries for the Blind|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was created as a result of the Wagner-O'Day Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9765238//|title=Award to Blind Marks Their Success in Jobs|last=Hennessy|first=Helen|date=14 March 1969|work=Irving Daily News|access-date=23 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIB helps coordinate orders and allocate orders to different workshops for the blind.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9765348//|title=Agency Assists Blind to Become Self-Supporting|last=|first=|date=28 February 1969|work=|access-date=23 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first president of NIB was Chester C. Kleber, who held that position until 1960.{{Sfn|Surrago|2013|p=127}}

After [[World War II]], the Committee on Purchases of Blind-Made Products decided that NIB should begin to sell in commercial markets.{{Sfn|Surrago|2013|p=15}} In 1952,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; NIB created the brand name, Skilcraft, which created a uniform label and emphasized the quality of the product.{{Sfn|Koestler|2004|p=250}} The brand name also allowed the company to be better able to expand into the commercial marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9764956//|title='Skilcraft' Up In Popularity|last=Cunniff|first=John|date=31 July 1969|work=The Indiana Gazette|access-date=23 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1960, NIB had 62 affiliated workshops.{{Sfn|Koestler|2004|p=250}} In 1970, black blind workers went on [[Strike action|strike]] at a Skilcraft plant in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], citing poor working conditions, discrimination and low wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9765603//|title=Blind Black Workers Strike at N.C.

In 1971, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Jacob Javits]] introduced legislation extending the act to "individuals with other severe [[Disability|disabilities]]."{{Sfn|Corning|1991|p=11}} The [[Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act]] (JWOD) also gave workshops for the blind a "five-year priority on service contracts."{{Sfn|Koestler|2004|p=255}} JWOD also created a committee, the Committee for Purchase from People who are Blind or Severely Disabled.{{Sfn|Corning|1991|p=11}}The committee would be made of 15 members appointed by the president, with each individual representing different federal agencies.{{Sfn|Corning|1991|p=11}} The committee also had a budget, as described by JWOD.{{Sfn|Koestler|2004|p=255}}

The Committee for Purchase designated NIB and National Industries for the Severely Handicapped ([[SourceAmerica|NISH]]) to be the two central, [[non-profit]] organizations which coordinate government acquisitions from hundreds of independent organizations for the blind and severely handicapped.{{Sfn|Corning|1991|p=1-2}}

By 1998, there were 85 agencies who were associated with NIB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanye|first=Robert|date=December 1998|title=Employment Update: The Missing Link: Real Work Experiences for People Who Are Visually Impaired|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=eric&amp;AN=EJ579510&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Journal of Visual Impairment &amp; Blindness|volume=92|issue=12|pages=844–847|subscription=yes|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skilcraft products==
The first products manufactured under the program were [[mop]]s and [[Broom (tool)|brooms]] for cleaning government offices.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.jsonline.com/business/with-help-from-snap-on-visually-impaired-workers-drive-home-a-point-b99429015z1-289517641.html|title=Visually impaired workers drive home a point with Snap-on|last=Barrett|first=Rick|date=22 January 2015|work=Journal Sentinel|access-date=2017-03-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government awarded around $220,000 in contracts to 36 workshops to manufacture the mops and brooms.{{Sfn|Corning|1991|p=27}} By 1939, NIB expanded to sell [[pillow]]cases, sanitary swabs, and fiber door mats.{{Sfn|Surrago|2013|p=12}}

Later, pens and office supplies were introduced.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/17/AR2010041701297.html |last=Mui |first=Ylan Q. |title=Low-tech Skilcraft Pens Endure in a High-tech World |publisher=''[[Washington Post]]'' |date=April 17, 2010 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIB would supply the government with 70 million [[ballpoint pen]]s a year by 1969.{{Sfn|Surrago|2013|p=22-23}} These pens have certain requirements, which include the ability to "write continuously for a mile and in temperatures up to 160 degrees and down to 40 degrees below zero."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The ballpoint pen contract helped create jobs for 125 new workers with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9765466//|title=Blind Workers Earn Record Wages In '69|last=|first=|date=29 November 1969|work=The Herald|access-date=23 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014, sales of the pens reached around five million dollars, with 60% of purchases from the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Dan|date=June 2014|title=The Pen Made for the White House|url=http://contentviewer.adobe.com/s/Reader's%20Digest/79f6bb82741b49038491f27f2b6ac15c/June%202014/5046.WK.WhoKnew.html|journal=Reader's Digest|volume=183|issue=1100|pages=140|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, there were 400 different items added to the list of items manufactured.{{Sfn|Corning|1991|p=29}}  In 2015, Skilcraft introduced a new line of products which included [[screwdriver]]s and [[socket wrench]]es.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Today, the Skilcraft name encompasses more than 3,500 products including office supplies, janitorial equipment, [[uniforms]], and [[hospital]] supplies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 2013|title=Enhancing Independence for People Who Are Blind|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bth&amp;AN=112638882&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Profiles in Diversity Journal|volume=15|issue=6|pages=14|subscription=yes|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skilcraft also provides services, such as call centers, on a contract basis to government agencies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Employing the blind==
Nearly 70% of blind individuals in the United States who are of working age are unemployed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Being able to work allows the blind to be both self-supporting and able to support others.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Skilcraft trade helps employ more than 5,000 blind Americans working for local agencies in 44 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theredstonerocket.com/news/article_cb4e8b20-acf9-11e2-be86-0019bb2963f4.html|title=Base Supply Center thanks its Redstone customers|last=Vaughn|first=Skip|date=24 April 2013|work=The Redstone Rocket|access-date=2017-03-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affiliates who make the Skilcraft brand, such as [[LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired|Lighthouse for the Blind]] are able to pay their employees between $8 and $12 an hour, provide [[health insurance]] and [[401(k)]] options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/communities/southside/article/San-Antonio-Lighthouse-for-the-Blind-a-top-5-5263900.php|title=San Antonio Lighthouse for the Blind a top-5 manufacturer in city|last=Gerlach|first=Jeremy T.|date=25 February 2014|work=San Antonio Express-News|access-date=2017-03-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams' paternal family is from [[Jhulasan]], [[Mehsana]] district in [[Gujarat]], India, while her maternal great-grandmother Mary Bohinc (originally Marija Bohinjec), born in [[Leše, Tržič|Leše]], Slovenia, immigrated to America as an eleven-year-old with her mother, 1891 [[Slovenes#Emigration|Slovene emigrant]] Ursula (Strajhar) Bohinac.&lt;ref name="Ancestry_Slovenia"&gt;[http://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/sunita-williams-spet-v-svoji-pradomovini.html Sunita Williams in her maternal ancestors' homeland one more time], [[Delo]], March 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ancestry_India"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-31/us-canada-news/38162229_1_sunita-williams-astronaut-gujarat-technical-university Sunita Williams to start her India trip from April 1], [[The Times of India]], March 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams graduated from [[Needham High School]] in [[Needham, Massachusetts]], in 1983. She received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[physical science]] from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1987, and a [[Master of Science]] degree in Engineering Management from [[Florida Institute of Technology]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="bio1" /&gt;

==Military career==
Williams was commissioned an ensign in the United States Navy in May 1987. After a six-month temporary assignment at the Naval Coastal System Command, she was designated a Basic Diving Officer. She next reported to the [[Naval Air Training Command]], where she was designated a [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviator]] in July 1989. She received initial [[H-46 Sea Knight]] training in Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 3 ([[HSC-3|HC-3]]), and was then assigned to Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 8 ([[HSC-8|HC-8]]) in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], with which she made overseas deployments to the Mediterranean, Red Sea and the Persian Gulf for [[Operation Desert Shield]] and [[Operation Provide Comfort]]. In September 1992, she was the Officer-in-Charge of an H-46 detachment sent to [[Miami, Florida]], for [[Hurricane Andrew]] relief operations aboard {{USS|Sylvania|AFS-2|6}}. In January 1993, Williams began training at the [[U.S. Naval Test Pilot School]]. She graduated in December, and was assigned to the Rotary Wing Aircraft Test Directorate as an H-46 Project Officer and [[V-22 Osprey|V-22]] chase pilot in the [[T-2 Buckeye|T-2]]. Later, she was assigned as the squadron Safety Officer and flew test flights in the [[SH-60 Seahawk|SH-60B/F]], [[UH-1]], [[AH-1W]], [[Kaman SH-2 Seasprite|SH-2]], [[SH-3 Sea King|VH-3]], H-46, [[CH-53]], and the [[H-57 Sea Ranger|H-57]]. In December 1995, she went back to the Naval Test Pilot School as an instructor in the Rotary Wing Department and as the school's Safety Officer. There she flew the [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|UH-60]], [[OH-6 Cayuse|OH-6]], and the [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58]]. She was then assigned to {{USS|Saipan|LHA-2|6}} as the Aircraft Handler and the Assistant Air Boss. Williams was deployed on ''Saipan'' in June 1998 when she was selected by [[NASA]] for the astronaut program.&lt;ref name="bio1" /&gt; She has logged more than 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 aircraft types.&lt;ref name="bio1" /&gt;

==NASA career==
[[File:Sunita Williams astronaut spacewalk.jpg|thumb|250px|Astronaut Sunita L. Williams, STS-116 mission specialist, participates in the mission's third planned session of extravehicular activity (EVA)]]

Sunita Williams began her Astronaut Candidate training at the [[Johnson Space Center]] in August 1998.Following are the space mission undertaken by Sunita Williams&lt;ref name="bio1" /&gt;

===STS-116===
Williams was launched to the International Space Station (ISS) with [[STS-116]], aboard the Space Shuttle [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']], on December 9, 2006, to join the [[Expedition 14]] crew. In April 2007, the Russian members of the crew rotated, changing to [[Expedition 15|Expedition]] .

===Expeditions 14 and 15===
[[File:ISS-14 Williams Marathon.jpg|thumb|250px|Williams became the first person to run a [[marathon]] from the space station on April 16, 2007]]
After launching aboard the Shuttle ''Discovery'', Williams arranged to donate her pony tail to [[Locks of Love]]. Fellow astronaut [[Joan Higginbotham]] cut her hair aboard the International Space Station and the ponytail was brought back to Earth by the [[STS-116]] crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-121906a.html |publisher=CollectSpace.com |author=CollectSpace.com |title=Astronaut cuts her hair in space for charity |date=2006-12-20 |access-date=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams performed her first [[extra-vehicular activity]] on the eighth day of the STS-116 mission. On January 31, February 4, and February 9, 2007, she completed three spacewalks from the ISS with [[Michael López-Alegría]]. During one of these walks, a camera became untethered, probably because the attaching device failed, and floated off to space before Williams could react.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adorama.com/catalog.tpl?op=NewsDesk_Internal&amp;article_num=122206-1 |title=Astronaut's Camera is Lost In Space |publisher=Adoama.com |date=2006-12-22 |accessdate=2007-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927075451/http://www.adorama.com/catalog.tpl?op=NewsDesk_Internal&amp;article_num=122206-1 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Astronauts Joan Higgrtdy work the controls of the [[Canadarm2]] in the [[International Space Station]]'s [[Destiny laboratory]]]]

On the third spacewalk, Williams was outside the station for 6 hours and 40 minutes to complete three spacewalks in nine days. She has logged 29 hours and 17 minutes in four spacewalks, eclipsing the record held by [[Kathryn C. Thornton]] for most spacewalk time by a woman.&lt;ref name="bio1" /&gt;&lt;ref Name=Malik /&gt; On December 18, 2007, during the fourth [[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalk]] of [[Expedition 16]], [[Peggy Whitson]] surpassed Williams, with a cumulative EVA time of 32 hours, 36 minutes.&lt;ref name="records4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-121807a.html |title=Astronauts make 100th station spacewalk |access-date=December 18, 2007 |publisher=CollectSpace |year=2007 |author=CollectSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="evarecords"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition16/exp16_eva_121807.html |title=Spacewalkers Find No Solar Wing Smoking Gun |access-date=December 18, 2007 |publisher=NASA |year=2007 |author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early March 2007, she received a tube of [[wasabi]] in a [[Progress spacecraft]] resupply mission in response to her request for more spicy food. When she opened the tube, which was packaged at one atmospheric pressure, the gel-like paste was forced out in the lower pressure of the ISS. In the free-fall environment, the spicy geyser was difficult to contain.&lt;ref name="spacestation"&gt;{{cite web |author=Schneider, Mike |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17421176/ |title=Space station suffers |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=2007-03-02 |access-date=2007-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, 2007, NASA decided to bring Williams back to Earth on the [[STS-117]] mission aboard [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. She did not break the U.S. single spaceflight record that was recently broken by former crew member Commander [[Michael López-Alegría]], but did break the record for longest single spaceflight by a woman.&lt;ref name="bio1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arrl.org/?artid=7183 |title=Ham-astronauts setting records in space |publisher=Amateur Radio News |author=Amateur Radio News |date=2007-02-05 |access-date=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stuck"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17821426/ |title=Astronaut stuck in space&amp;nbsp;— for now |access-date=December 19, 2007 |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |year=2007 |author=Mike Schneider for [[The Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams served as a mission specialist and returned to Earth on June 22, 2007, at the end of the STS-117 mission. Poor weather at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in [[Cape Canaveral]] forced mission managers to skip three landing attempts there over previous 24 hours. They then diverted ''Atlantis'' to [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in [[California]], where the shuttle touched down at 3:49&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]], returning Williams home after a record 192-day stay in space.

===First marathon in space===

On April 16, 2007, she ran the first marathon by any person in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition14/exp14_boston_marathon.html |title=Race From Space Coincides with Race on Earth |author=Eldora Valentine |publisher=NASA |date=2007-04-06 |access-date=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams was listed as an entrant for the 2007 [[Boston Marathon]], and completed the distance in four hours and 24 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |publisher=Zee News Limited |url=http://www.zeenews.com/znnew/articles.asp?aid=366217&amp;ssid=27&amp;sid=ENV |title=Sunita Williams Runs Marathon in Space |date=2007-04-17 |access-date=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marathon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17862610/ |title=Astronaut to run Boston Marathon&amp;nbsp;— in space |access-date=December 19, 2007 |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |year=2007 |author=Jimmy Golen for [[The Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="release"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/releases/2007/H07-078.html |title=NASA Astronaut to Run Boston Marathon in Space |access-date=December 19, 2007 |publisher=NASA |year=2007 |author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other crew members cheered her on and gave her oranges during the race. Williams' sister, Dina Pandya, and fellow astronaut [[Karen L. Nyberg]] ran the marathon on Earth, and Williams received updates on their progress from Mission Control. In 2008, Williams participated in the Boston Marathon again, this time on Earth.

===Expeditions 32 and 33===
[[File:Expedition 32 Flight Engineer Sunita Williams exercises on COLBERT.jpg|thumb|250px|Williams exercises on [[Treadmill with Vibration Isolation Stabilization|COLBERT]] during ISS Expedition 32]]
[[File:ISS-32 American EVA b6 Sunita Williams.jpg|thumb|250px|Sunita Williams, Expedition 32 flight engineer, appears to touch the bright sun during a spacewalk conducted on September 5, 2012.]]

Williams launched from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] on July 15, 2012, as part of [[Expedition 32]]/[[Expedition 33|33]]. Her Russian spacecraft [[Soyuz TMA-05M]] docked with the ISS for a four-month stay at the orbiting outpost on July 17, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/et-cetera/sunita-williams-spacecraft-docks-with-iss/articleshow/15015460.cms |title=Sunita Williams' spacecraft docks with ISS |date=July 17, 2012 |work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The docking of the Soyuz occurred at 4:51 GMT as the ISS flew over [[Kazakhstan]] at an altitude of 252 miles. The hatchway between the Soyuz spacecraft and the ISS was opened at 7:23 GMT and Williams floated into the ISS to begin her duties as a member of the Expedition 32 crew. She was accompanied on the Soyuz TMA-05M spacecraft by [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA) astronaut [[Aki Hoshide]] and Russian [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Malenchenko]]. Williams served as commander of the ISS during her stay onboard ISS Expedition 33, succeeding [[Gennady Padalka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-17/science/33901492_1_commander-gennady-padalka-joe-acaba-sergei-revin |title=Sunita Williams takes over command at International Space Station |date=2012-09-17 |work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became the commander of the [[International Space Station]] on September 17, 2012, being only the second woman to achieve the feat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/indianamerican-astronaut-sunita-williams-takes-over-command-at-space-station/1003686/ |title=Indian-American astronaut Sunita williams takes over command at space station |publisher=Indian Express |date= |access-date=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in September 2012, she became the first person to do a triathlon in space, which coincided with the Nautica Malibu Triathlon held in Southern [[California]].&lt;ref name="space.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.space.com/17643-space-triathlon-astronaut-sunita-williams.html|title=Space triathlon with Sunita}}&lt;/ref&gt; She used the [[International Space Station]]'s own treadmill and stationary bike, and for the swimming portion of the race, she used the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) to do weightlifting and resistance exercises that approximate swimming in microgravity. After 'swimming' half a mile (0.8&amp;nbsp;km), 'biking' 18 miles (29&amp;nbsp;km), and 'running' 4 miles (6.4&amp;nbsp;km), Williams finished with a time of one hour, 48 minutes and 33 seconds, as she reported.&lt;ref name="space.com" /&gt;

She returned to earth with fellow astronauts Flight Engineers [[Yuri Malenchenko]] and [[Aki Hoshide]] on November 19, 2012, touching down in the town of [[Arkalyk, Kazakhstan]]. Helicopters joined the search-and-recovery crew to assist them, as their capsule parachuted down some {{convert|35|km}} from the planned touchdown site due to a procedural delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/sunita-williams-returns-to-earth/1/229750 |title=Sunita Williams returns to Earth after 4 months in space |author=[[Staff writer]] |work=India Today |date=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space-walks===
{{As of|2012|8}}, Williams has made seven spacewalks totaling 50 hours and 40 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition32/exp32_eva3.html |title=Williams, Hoshide Complete MBSU Installation |author=NASA |publisher=nasa.gov |date=September 6, 2012 |access-date=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; putting Williams in No. 9 on the [[List of cumulative spacewalk records|list of most experienced spacewalkers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/station/exp33/121101eva/ |title=Astronauts bypass station cooling system on spacewalk |author=William Harwood |date=November 1, 2012 |access-date=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 30, 2012, Williams and JAXA astronaut Hoshide ventured outside the ISS to conduct US EVA-18. They removed and replaced the failing Main Bus Switching Unit-1 (MBSU-1), and installed a thermal cover onto Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 (PMA-2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/07/soyuz-tma-05m-launch-trio-international-space-station/ |title=Soyuz TMA-05M launches trio to the International Space Station |publisher=NASAspaceflight.com |author=Pete Harding, Chris Bergin and William Graham |date=July 14, 2012 |access-date=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial Crew program===
In July 2015, NASA announced Williams as one of the first astronauts for [[Commercial Crew Development|U.S. Commercial spaceflights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-astronauts-for-first-us-commercial-spaceflights-0 | title=NASA Selects Astronauts for First U.S. Commercial Spaceflights | author=NASA| publisher=nasa.gov|date=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, she has started working with [[Boeing]] and [[SpaceX]] to train in their commercial crew vehicles, along with other chosen astronauts. In August 2018 she was assigned to the first mission flight, [[CTS-1]], to the [[International Space Station]] of the Boeing [[CST-100 Starliner]].&lt;ref name=nasacc_crew&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-assigns-crews-to-first-test-flights-missions-on-commercial-spacecraft |title=NASA Assigns Crews to First Test Flights, Missions on Commercial Spacecraft |date=August 3, 2018 |access-date=August 4, 2018 |website=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
She was a member of [[Society of Experimental Test Pilots]].

Williams is married to Michael J. Williams, a [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|Federal police officer]] in [[Oregon]]. The two have been married for more than 20 years, and both flew [[helicopter]]s in the early days of their careers. She had a pet [[Jack Russell Terrier]] named Gorby (deceased) who was featured with her on the ''[[Dog Whisperer]]'' television show on the [[National Geographic Channel]] on November 12, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/dog-whisperer/4533/Overview Dog Whisperer: Astronaut Dogs &amp; Mongo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714155714/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/dog-whisperer/4533/Overview |date=July 14, 2011 }}, National Geographic Channel, November 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Williams expressed a desire to adopt a girl from [[Ahmedabad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-27/ahmedabad/32440687_1_sunita-williams-deepak-pandya-girl-child-campaign |title=Astronaut Sunita Williams to adopt Gujarati girl |date=June 27, 2012 |work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, Williams visited India. She went to the [[Sabarmati Ashram]] and her ancestral village [[Jhulasan]] in [[Gujarat]]. She was awarded the [[Vallabhbhai Patel|Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]] Vishwa Pratibha Award by the World Gujarati Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/sunita-gets-vishwa-pratibha-award/219791/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130122173955/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/sunita-gets-vishwa-pratibha-award/219791/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-22 |title=Sunita Williams |accessdate=2012-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|person of Indian descent]] who was not an Indian citizen to be presented the award. On October 4, 2007, Williams spoke at the [[American Embassy School]], and then met [[Manmohan Singh]], the then [[Prime Minister of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Astronaut Sunita Williams Visits AES |publisher=American Embassy School |author=American Embassy School |date=2007-10-05 |url=http://202.54.248.150/aesnews/?p=10 |accessdate=2007-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011163333/http://202.54.248.150/aesnews/?p=10 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Total Operations Processing System''', or '''TOPS''', is a computer system for managing the [[locomotive]]s and [[rolling stock]] ([[railroad car]]s) owned by and/or operated on a rail system.  It was originally developed by the American-based [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific Railroad]] and was widely sold; it is best known in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] for its use by [[British Rail]] (BR) and its successors.

==Early development==
The [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] was ahead of the pack in its embracing of technology.  In the early 1960s, it developed a computer system called 'Total Operations Processing System', or 'TOPS'.  The purpose was to take all the paperwork associated with a locomotive or [[rolling stock]] - its maintenance history, its allocation to division and depot and duty, its status, its location, and much more - and keep it in computer form, constantly updated by terminals at every maintenance facility.&lt;ref name=s-b&gt;{{Simmons-Biddle}}, Pp515-516.&lt;/ref&gt;  On paper, this information was difficult to keep track of, difficult to keep up to date, and difficult to query; requiring many telephone calls.  Computerizing this information enabled a railroad to keep better track of its assets, and to use them better.&lt;ref name=s-b/&gt;

In order to offset the development costs of the system, Southern Pacific sold it to other railroads. A number of American railroads took to the system, as did many others around the world.

==Adoption by British Rail==
In the mid to late 1960s, [[British Rail]] (BR) was searching around for ways to increase efficiency, and came across the TOPS system in a 1968 presentation by an [[IBM]] US Transportation Industry Representative, who shortly after, formed IBM World Trade Corp's [[Transportation Industry Centre]] in [[Brussels]] (E. Wrathall).  They purchased the system (along with source code, as was typical for such a large mainframe-based system in those days) and implemented it, assisted by Southern Pacific data processing experts.  At the time, the [[British Government]] operated a 'Buy British' policy for the nationalised industries, and the purchase of an [[IBM System/360]] mainframe to operate TOPS had to be approved by the Cabinet of Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]].

The adoption of the TOPS system made for some changes in the way the railway system in Britain worked. Hitherto, locomotives were numbered in three different series. [[Steam locomotives of British Railways|Steam locomotives]] carried unadorned numbers up to five digits long. [[Diesel locomotive]]s carried one to four-digit numbers prefixed with a letter 'D', and electric locomotives with a letter 'E'. Thus, up to three locomotives could carry the same number. TOPS could not handle this, and it also required similar locomotives to be numbered in a consecutive series in terms of classification, in order that they might be treated together as a group.

===TOPS numbering under British Rail===
{{Details|British Rail locomotive and multiple unit numbering and classification#1973 numbering and classification - TOPS|British carriage and wagon numbering and classification}}
[[File:British Rail Class 31-4 dataplate.jpg|thumb|''Brush Type 2'' locomotives became [[British Rail Class 31|Class 31]] under TOPS. This is the data panel from a Class 31/4; the 31/4 subclass being used for locomotives with [[Electric Train Heating]].]]

Sequentiality was all that was required, but with the requirement to renumber, it was decided to adopt a logical system for classification, and the five- or six-digit TOPS number was divided into two parts. No class of locomotive or [[multiple unit]] numbered over 1000 examples, so the last three digits were used for the individual number between 001 and 999 (Although [[British Rail Class 43 (HST)| Class 43]] goes down to 000, it being the [[British Rail Class 41 (HST)|HST Prototype]] power Cars) in that class. The first two or three digits were used to denote the class of locomotive or multiple unit. The numbers were often written in two space separated groups, such as "47 401" to highlight that division, but the TOPS system actually stored and displayed them without the space: "47401". Sub-classifications were indicated in the TOPS system with a slash and a subclass number, e.g. "47/4". It was convention, though not enforced within the TOPS system, that subclass numbers were boundaries in the locomotive numbering system, such that class "47/4" started with number "47 401". If there were more than 99 numbers in a subclass, the number series extended to the next value of the third digit; thus, since there were more than 200 locomotives in class "47/4", subclasses "47/5" and "47/6" did not exist, and the next valid subclass by convention was "47/7" starting with "47 701".  However, in some cases, the sequences do not match, e.g. [[British Rail Class 158|158/'''0''']] numbers start at 158 '''7'''01.

Locomotives are assigned classes 01–98: diesel locomotives 01–79 (originally 01–69),  AC electric locomotives 80–96, departmental locos (those not in revenue-earning use) 97, and steam locomotives 98. DC [[electric locomotive]]s were originally allocated classes 70–79 but this was modified in 2011 (see [[British Rail locomotive and multiple unit numbering and classification]]); the sole relic of this is [[British Rail Class 73|Class 73]] which continues unrenumbered, probably because it can be considered equally a diesel locomotive as it is a DC electric. One oddity was the inclusion of British Rail's shipping fleet in the system as Class 99. [[Diesel multiple unit]]s (DMUs) with mechanical or hydraulic transmission are classified 100–199, with electric transmission 200–299. [[Electric multiple unit]]s (EMUs) are given the subsequent classes; 300–399 are overhead AC units (including AC/DC dual-voltage units, and new DC only units with pantogaph wells allowing for conversion to AC), while Southern Region DC [[third rail]] EMUs are 400–499, other DC EMUs 500–599. Selected numbers in the 900 series have been used for departmental multiple units, mostly converted from former passenger units. 

There are also a number of electric and bi-mode (diesel-electric) units in service, under construction or being planned that use the 700 and 800 series, which include:
*[[British Rail Class 700|Class 700]] — for the [[Thameslink Programme]], now in service
*[[British Rail Class 800|Class 800]] and [[British Rail Class 801|801]] — for the [[Intercity Express Programme]], undergoing trials as of 2017.

[[Coach (rail)|Coaching stock]] and individual multiple unit cars are allocated five-digit numbers; since the early 1980s, it has been forbidden for them to have the same numbers as locomotives, but before then duplication was possible because they carried a prefix letter, which was considered part of the number. More recent EMU deliveries have six-figure coach numbers.

==Recent history==
TOPS has grown very out of date in recent decades. It is a [[text terminal|text-terminal]], mainframe-driven system; which is regarded as not very user-friendly, and hard to use compared with contemporary computer user-interfaces. In addition, it is written in its own programming language, TOPSTRAN (not strictly speaking a separate language but a set of IBM Assembler macros), and it is increasingly hard to find and train developers to maintain it. The division of British Rail and privatisation has also hurt TOPS, because it was never really designed for that; some [[freight operating company|freight operating companies]] do not keep information as up to date as they should.

Attempts have been made to 'skin' the system with a more user-friendly interface, called TOPS 2000; in addition, there are other parallel systems now, such as [[TRUST]], Genius and the Mobile Consisting Application,&lt;ref name="MCA3SQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mobile Consisting Application|url=https://railsmart.io/Operations?v=636673298779639333#mca-section|website=RailSmart|publisher=RailSmart|accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but none has yet fully supplanted the TOPS system.

==Sample output==
This is a typical report that a TOPS clerk could generate. The train in question is a 25 wagon freight train travelling from [[Over and Wharton railway station|Over &amp; Wharton]], near [[Winsford]], to [[Reading West railway station|Reading West]] Junction, [[Berkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sddt.co.uk/newsletters/NewsLetter%208%20Oct%202001.htm South Devon Railway newsletter 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}
'''Targeting''' is the process of selecting objects or installations to be attacked, taken, or destroyed in [[warfare]]. Targeting systematically analyzes and prioritizes targets and matches appropriate lethal and nonlethal actions to those targets to create specific desired effects that achieve the joint force commander’s (JFC’s) objectives, accounting for operational requirements, capabilities, and the results of previous assessments. The emphasis of targeting is on identifying resources (targets) the enemy can least afford to lose or that provide him with the greatest advantage (high-value target [HVT]), then further identifying the subset of those targets which
must be acquired and engaged to achieve friendly success (high-payoff target [HPT]). Targeting links
the desired effects to actions and tasks.

The targeting process can be generally grouped into two categories: deliberate and dynamic. Deliberate targeting prosecutes anticipated or known targets within a given operational area and timeframe,&lt;ref name="Hughey1"&gt;Hughey, R. L., &amp; McGovern, J. (2007). Targeting at the Speed of Light. AIR UNIV MAXWELL AFB AL.&lt;/ref&gt; and normally supports the joint force’s future plans effort, which is overseen by the plans directorate of a joint staff (J-5). (Normally, the future operations directorate focuses on 24 hours up to 72 hours. This is a critical linkage during targeting execution.) By contrast, dynamic targeting prosecutes targets that were not included in the deliberate targeting process, possibly because they were not known or not initially selected for prosecution.&lt;ref name="Hughey1" /&gt; Dynamic targeting is normally employed in current operations planning because the nature and time frame associated with current operations (usually the current 24-hour period) typically requires more immediate responsiveness compared to deliberate targeting.

Technologically advanced countries can generally select their [[wiktionary:Target|target]]s in such a way as to minimize [[collateral damage]] and [[civilian casualties]]. This can fall by the wayside, however, during unrestricted warfare.

Targeting may also refer to the targeting of the actual objective to be destroyed by military personnel, such as "painting" a target with a [[laser]] for laser guided munitions, estimating range for [[artillery]], etc.

A target is an entity (person, place, or thing) considered for possible engagement or action to alter or neutralize the function it performs for the adversary. Every target has distinct intrinsic or acquired characteristics that form the basis for target detection, location, identification, and classification for ongoing and future surveillance, analysis, engagement, and assessment. Physical, functional, cognitive, environmental, and temporal are broad categories that help define the characteristics of a target.

The joint targeting cycle is a six phase iterative process: Phase 1 - End state and commander’s objectives, Phase 2 - Target development and prioritization, Phase 3 - Capabilities analysis, Phase 4 - Commander’s decision and force assignment, Phase 5 - Mission planning and force execution, Phase 6 - Assessment.

==Targeting cycles in practice==
General [[Stanley A. McChrystal]] wrote in 2014 about a targeting cycle called "F3EA" used in the [[Iraq War]], which stands for:
#Find: A target (person or location) is first identified and located.
#Fix: The target is then kept under continuous surveillance to ensure it hasn't moved.
#Finish: A raiding force is assigned to capture or kill the target.
#Exploit: Intelligence material is secured and mined, with detainees interrogated.
#Analyze: Information is studied to identify further targeting opportunities.&lt;ref name="McChrystal2014"&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1366">'''Titadyn 30 AG''' (often referred to as '''Titadine''') is a type of compressed [[dynamite]] used in mining and manufactured in southern [[France]] by [[Titanite]] S.A. The explosive comes in the form of [[salmon pink|salmon]]-coloured tubes of a range of diameters, from 50 to 120&amp;nbsp;mm. Titadine is very powerful and fast-burning, with an energy rating of 4650 J/g and a speed of detonation of over 6,000&amp;nbsp;m/s.

In recent years, it has been used in bomb attacks by the separatist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] in [[Spain]]. In September 1999 a combined group of ETA members and [[Breton Revolutionary Army|Breton separatists]] raided a factory at [[Plevin]], [[Brittany]], stealing over eight tonnes of Titadyn (some of which was subsequently sold to the [[Islamist]] resistance group [[Hamas]], according to Spain's ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'' newspaper{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}&lt;!-- References? --&gt;). Another raid took place in March 2001 when an explosives factory near [[Grenoble]] in France was targeted and 1.6 tonnes of Titadyn was stolen. Much of it was later recovered by Spanish police in raids, or was used by ETA in car bomb attacks in Spanish cities.

'''Toshiba Samsung Storage Technology Corporation''' (abbreviated '''TSST''') is an international joint venture company of [[Toshiba Corporation|Toshiba]] ([[Japan]]) and [[Samsung Electronics]] ([[South Korea]]).  Toshiba owns 51% of its stock, while Samsung owns the remaining 49%.  The company specialises in [[optical disc drive]] manufacturing.  The company was established in 2004.
[[File:DVD Writer TS-L633, Toshiba Samsung Storage Technology-4605.jpg|thumb|A slimline DVD Writer TS-L633]]
The company's headquarters is located in [[Shibaura]], [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] with Hiroshi Suzuki as its President and CEO. Its subsidiary, Toshiba Samsung Storage Technology Korea Corporation is located in [[Suwon]], [[South Korea]], and headed by [[Dae Sung Kim]].

Each corporation in Japan and Korea has the individual directorate system.  For the business issues, TSST has been discussing it through the common relevant organization for mutual consent.  TSST is currently responsible for the product development, marketing and sales, and has been taking advantage of the existing network of Samsung Electronics and Toshiba for manufacturing, sales, and after-sales service.

In October 2009, TSST had received a subpoena from the U.S. Justice Department for possibly violating the antitrust laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/10/27/us-opticaldisc-antitrust-idUKTRE59Q34Q20091027 | title=U.S. investigating optical disc drive industry | work=Reuters | date=October 27, 2009 | accessdate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samsung and Toshiba sold their stake in TSST to Optis Co., Ltd., a Korean manufacturer that made products for TSST under contract.&lt;ref name="Chap15"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law360.com/articles/814226/toshiba-samsung-jv-wins-korean-bankruptcy-shield

In 2016 TSST entered Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in Delaware US, shielding it from most U.S. creditor actions while the company reorganizes its business in Korea’s court system and restructures a $78 million debt.&lt;ref name="Chap15" /&gt;
