[[File:T-43AFlightManualTitlePage.jpg|Boeing T-43A Flight Manual|thumb]]
An '''aircraft flight manual''' ('''AFM''') is a book containing the information required to safely operate the aircraft. The information within an AFM is also referred to a Technical Airworthiness Data (TAWD). A typical flight manual will contain the following: operating limitations, Normal/Abnormal/Emergency operating procedures, performance data and loading information.

Example AFM content:
* [[V speeds]]
* [[Aircraft gross weight]]
* [[Maximum ramp weight]]
* [[Maximum takeoff weight]]
* [[Manufacturer's empty weight]]
* [[Operating empty weight]]
* [[Center of gravity of an aircraft]]
* [[Lift-to-drag ratio]]
* [[Zero-fuel weight]]

A typical AFM is a pilot's operating handbook (POH), which became the standard format for an AFM after 1978.
An aircraft flight manual is serial number specific, whereas a pilot's operating handbook is merely model specific.

[[File:Andrew-Safford House.jpg|thumb|The Andrew-Safford House at 13 Washington Square]]
Owned by the [[Peabody Essex Museum]], the '''Andrew–Safford House''' (13 Washington Square).  Built in 1819 and was designed in the Federal style by an unknown architect for a wealthy Russian fur merchant. It is reputed to have been the most costly house erected in New England at the time. The massive vertical façade and the four large columns rising from the ground to the third story on the south side make this one of the most impressive houses in Salem. The house is a contributing property to the [[Essex Institute Historic District]], listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The '''Annales Paulini''' is an [[List of English chronicles|English medieval chronicle]]. The Chronicles of St Paul's, as the Annales Paulini might be translated, is thought to have been written by a canon of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], London.  Because it covers the period of 1307-1341 it is invaluable for the history of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]'s reign.  [[Adam Murimuth]] was a canon contemporaneously and originally from Oxford, thus intimating the author as his friend.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11819">'''BiblioCommons''' is a privately held company, based in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, that develops [[Front and back ends|front end]] interactive catalog and web services for libraries.

Over 200 [[Public library|public libraries]] in four countries, worldwide, currently use a '''BiblioCommons''' [[OPAC]] (Online Public Access Catalog). [[BiblioCore]], the online catalog, integrates with existing [[Integrated library system]]s (ILSs) and creates a complete OPAC replacement that features intuitive searching, account integration, new tools for discovery, [[Ebook|eBook]] integration, library staff recommendations, and the ability to create a community around the library collection.

Other services include a mobile suite with BiblioMobile; the ability to manage web sites that have dynamic web options with BiblioCMS (content management system); to integrate summer reading microsites with Biblio Summer Sites; to make public library resources available through school library catalogs with BiblioSchools; to integrate ebook lending and buying within the catalog with BiblioDigital; and to integrate event listings straight into the catalog with BiblioEvents. There are more options, modules, and improvements being worked on all the time.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In 2008, ''[[Library Journal]]'' called BiblioCommons "a revolutionary social discovery system for libraries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2008/07/industry-news/bibliocommons-emerges-revolutionary-social-discovery-system-for-libraries/|website=Library Journal| title=BiblioCommons Emerges: ‘Revolutionary’; Social Discovery System for Libraries|date=July 19, 2008| author=Oder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BiblioCommons has an arrangement with [[Knowledge Ontario]] that makes it Knowledge Ontario's "Connect Ontario" project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Knowledge Ontario |url=http://www.knowledgeontario.ca/Connect/index.html |title=&lt;Index |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417212001/http://knowledgeontario.ca/Connect/index.html |archivedate=2009-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
BiblioCommons began not as a software company, but as a nonprofit youth [[literacy]] initiative. Co-founder Beth Jefferson was interested in the ways teens were using [[emerging technologies]] to engage with [[popular culture]] and wondered how youth literacy could be improved if a social context around reading could be established online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bibliocommons.com/sites/all/themes/bibliocommons/images/content/Origins-StarArticle.pdf|title=Pop Culture is Hook for Teen Readers|work=The Toronto Star|access-date=2013-09-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191623/http://www.bibliocommons.com/sites/all/themes/bibliocommons/images/content/Origins-StarArticle.pdf|archive-date=2013-10-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perF!nk Project (Perceive. Feel. Think) that emerged won a national award from the Information Technology Association of Canada (ITAC) and began attracting broader attention – particularly, from libraries.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===From perF!nk to BiblioCommons===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
Asking questions, the team began to explore the potential leverage of the public library’s online catalog for the end user. Could they create conversation and engagement where people already were, in the library’s web catalog?

The perf!nk project caught the attention of The Ontario Library Association, which committed research funding. Over the next 18 months, BiblioCommons conducted surveys and more than 100 one-on-one interviews in four library systems to explore the possibilities for re-envisioning the library catalog.Three Canadian provincial agencies were sufficiently impressed with the research and resulting vision to fund [[prototypes]], and ultimately to purchase advance subscriptions. Their early commitments enabled BiblioCommons to build the envisioned services and roll them out to interested libraries in those jurisdictions.

===From beta to production===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
Following 18 months of user research and a year-long [[beta test]], with six libraries, as well as ongoing research and feedback, BiblioCommons created prototypes of the BIblioCore catalog and improved scalability, usability, and [[configurability]] before rolling out to broader audiences.

BiblioCommons re-launched its re-designed services to several large systems in late 2009.

==Searching and rating==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
The basic BiblioCore search box is built with automatic relevance ranking [[algorithms]], [[data mapping]], [[faceted search]]es, natural language detection, and a "did-you-mean?" functionality to make searching the online public library catalog easier and more intuitive. Advanced searches allow a user to narrow down their query by format, location, availability, topic, publication date, tag, and more.

Users that are logged into the library system can add tags to books, ratings, age recommendations, book reviews, and more. Anything added to the BiblioCore catalog can be seen by other users on the BiblioCommons system, making the library catalog a larger, more diverse and more robust online community.

Users can also create shelves with which to group books; create "completed", "in progress", and "for later" shelves to manage and sequence their reading progress; and follow other library users for book recommendations and reviews.

==Other products==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
BiblioCommons also offers other modules and products that work with BiblioCore for public libraries.

*'''Biblio Summer Sites''' is a suite of micro-sites that can be added to a library catalog to create summer reading groups for kids, teens, and adults. The sites have customizable [[avatar (computing)|avatar]]s, badges that can be won or awarded, reading goals, reading challenges, and quizzes.
*'''BiblioWeb''' is a complete content management system for library websites.
*'''BiblioCore''' replaces all the traditional functionality of the library's online catalog and integrates it with discovery and interactive experiences that library customers experience daily elsewhere on the web. It replaces the traditional library [[OPAC]] (online public access catalog).
*'''BiblioDigital''' is an eBook platform that allows libraries to deliver eBooks through the catalog, instead of through a separate third-party website. It is designed to work with any eBook vendor, so that libraries can showcase their books in one interface, and users can access and read their eBooks through a library-centric environment. BiblioDigital went live in beta in May 2013.
*'''BiblioEvents''' integrates event creation and program features into the library catalog.
*'''BiblioMobile''' is offered as a module for BiblioCore and is a suite of apps for Android, iPhone, and other mobile browsers. It creates a mobile-friendly library catalog and website for users on all platforms.
*'''BiblioSchools''' makes the entire resources of the public library available to school students and educators through the school library catalog. Currently, it supports the Destiny ILS by Follett.

==Libraries that are using BiblioCommons==
As of April 2014, BiblioCommons has been adopted by over 200 libraries in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States, and has over five million registered BiblioCommons users.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The '''Brewster–Sanford expedition''' was an [[ornithology|ornithological]] collecting expedition which procured [[bird collections|specimens]], principally of [[South America]]n [[seabird]]s, for the [[museum collections|collections]] of the [[American Museum of Natural History]].  It was initiated by Dr. [[Leonard Cutler Sanford]] and financially supported by Frederick F. Brewster, both of [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. The expedition took place from 1912 to 1917, with its core members the experienced bird collector [[Rollo Beck]] and his wife Ida, though additional assistance was used at many places. Although most of the nearly 8,000 specimens collected were seabirds, land birds were opportunistically acquired as well.  Various [[watercraft]] were used in the course of the expedition, where much of the collection work was carried out at sea.

==Expedition==
The Becks left [[San Francisco]] on 4 December 1912. The first collecting was carried out in [[Peru]], working along the coast as well as making some inland trips.  Based at shore stations, and using hired fishing boats, Rollo Beck would often row out to sea alone, and sometimes with a man to assist him, as far as 20&amp;nbsp;km offshore, collecting birds from dawn to dusk.  1913 was taken up by work along the coasts of Peru and [[Chile]], with trips also made to the [[Juan Fernández Islands]]. 1914 saw the Becks working their way southwards along the Chilean coast to the [[Chiloé Archipelago]] and then, in July, to [[Magallanes Province]].

Ramifications of the outbreak of [[First World War|war in Europe]] caused some difficulties for the Becks, but in August 1914 they visited the [[Falkland Islands]] and then moved to [[Mar del Plata]], Argentina, where they were based until November.  Then, after revisiting the Falklands, and using a hired [[sloop]], the “''Leguri'',” the Becks spent December and January sailing and collecting in the waterways and islands around [[Cape Horn]] and the [[Beagle Channel]].

From February 1915 the Becks collected from Magallanes and around [[Tierra del Fuego]] using the [[schooner]] “''Antarctica''.”  They visited the Falklands in September and again in October, where they stayed through January 1916 before moving northwards to [[Uruguay]] and the coast of [[Brazil]] which they worked for several months before sailing to the [[Caribbean]] and collecting through the island of [[Hispaniola]] from September 1916 to July 1917.  From mid July to the end of August 1917 the Becks collected in [[Cuba]] and returned to the United States at the beginning of September.

Beck’s report and narrative of the expedition was summarised by [[Robert Cushman Murphy]] in his “Oceanic Birds of South America,” in which he comments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;”The specimens of birds obtained during the course of the Brewster-Sanford Expedition number 7,853. Those that may be broadly classed as water birds comprise upwards of a hundred species. The collection is, naturally, more notable for its full representation of the South American sea bird fauna, including hitherto little known rarities, than it is for forms new to science.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
“When one considers the faultless character of the skins, and the great body of associated data, such as nests, eggs, notes, and photographs – and when one balances all of these tangible credits against the obstacles, disappointment, and discomforts of the journey briefly retold above – then it becomes clear that the treasure obtained by Mr Beck and his courageous helpmeet is a monument to rare skill and indomitable persistence.  Up to date, it is safe to say, no other ornithological collector has carried through a similar campaign, or matched such scientific spoils.”&lt;ref&gt;Murphy (1936).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Results==
New birds described from Hispaniola include the [[least poorwill]] (''Siphonorhis brewsteri''), the [[white-winged warbler]] (''Xenoligea montana''), and the Hispaniolan subspecies of the [[grey-fronted quail-dove]] (''Geotrygon caniceps leucometopia'').&lt;ref&gt;Chapman (1917).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}} __NOTOC__
The '''Brokmerbrief''' or '''Law of Brokmerland''' is the early 13th-century law code of the ''brocmanni'', the inhabitants of [[Brokmerland]], west of [[Aurich]] in [[East Frisia]]. The area had been placed under cultivation and settled by the end of the 12th century. It survives in two manuscripts. The work is sometimes referred to as the '''Brookmerbrief''', using the modern spelling of "[[Brookmerland]]".

The Brokmerbrief is the most complete source on Frisian law. It describes the polity and judicial system of a country whose law was based on the will of the assembled people (the '[[Frisian freedom]]'): political and judicial power was in the hands of functionaries selected annually from the ranks of the farmers, who were known as ''redjeven'' (consuls, counsellors); their power in turn was regulated by the Brokmerbrief.

The period of independent rural self-rule came to an end by about the mid-14th century. However, unlike for example [[Emsigerland]], Brokmerland remained a discrete unit, since the Brokmerbrief forbids the erection of fortified stone residences and castles and this had prevented the establishment of such starting points for localised rule. Thus [[feudalism]], otherwise widespread throughout Europe at this time, remained unknown in East Frisia.

However, Emsig Law eventually prevailed in the area, probably as a result of the emergence of the [[tom Brok]] dynasty, but certainly by the time of [[Cirksena]] hegemony. In the early 16th century, [[Edzard I, Count of East Frisia|Edzard I]] then based his [[East Frisian Law]] ({{lang-de|Ostfriesisches Landrecht}}) on the Emsig Law.

The Brokmerbrief is unique among the documents of Old Frisian law in consisting of a code of law in the strict sense, rather than a compilation. It is preserved in two manuscripts, one of which is in the State Archives of [[Lower Saxony]] in [[Oldenburg]] and the other in the Lower Saxony State Library in [[Hanover]].

The middle section of the text strongly resembles the Emsig law on fines, indicating a common source.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Freiherr von Richthofen, ''Untersuchungen über friesische Rechtsgeschichte'', Volume 1 Berlin: Hertz, 1880, {{OCLC|9008105}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=345KAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;dq=Brokmerbrief&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aHcI3dck1f&amp;sig=hCZXs5AT-WP5yl5AxABMR8czf5k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DbJNU9j0GqSMyAGbuYCoDw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBTgK#v=snippet&amp;q=%C3%BCberliefern%2C%20ist%20eine%20so%20w%C3%B6rtliche&amp;f=false pp. 218&amp;ndash;19] {{de icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The text is a valuable source of localised and dateable information on [[Old Frisian]].&lt;ref&gt;Elmar Seebold, [http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/de-gruyter/der-aufbau-des-altfriesischen-brokmerbriefs-ogyWbTkrf1 "Der Aufbau des altfriesischen Brokmerbriefs"], ''[[Pauls und Braunes Beiträge|Beiträge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur]]'' 97 (1975) 365&amp;ndash;95, p. 365 {{de icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="991">'''''Brown v Mbhense and Another''''' (2008) is an important case in the South African law of lease.

The respondent instituted an action in the Land Claims Court for an order declaring her to be a "labour tenant" as defined in the Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act.

The appellant was the owner of the farm in question and did not oppose the plaintiff's action.

The plaintiff's claim succeeded in the court ''a quo'', and the defendant appealed against that decision to the Supreme Court of Appeal, which held that to gauge the existence of a labour-tenancy agreement in the technical and precise manner akin to that applicable to usual residential or commercial tenancies was far too restrictive an approach, and one that went against the objective and general tenor of the Act.

The '''''Chronica Sclavorum''''' or '''''Chronicle of the Slavs''''' is a medieval [[chronicle]] which recounts the [[Slavic paganism|pre-Christian]] culture and religion of the [[Polabian Slavs]], written by [[Helmold]] (ca. 1120 – after 1177), a Saxon priest and historian. It describes events related to northwest Slavic tribes known as the [[Wends]] up to 1171.&lt;ref&gt;Helmold: Chronica Slavorum. Neu übertragen und erläutert von Heinz Stoob. In: Ausgewählte Quellen zur deutschen Geschichte des Mittelalters. Wiss. Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 1963, 2. Auflage 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

It is a continuation of [[Adam of Bremen]]'s ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum|Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church]]'' and was in turn continued by [[Arnold of Lübeck]]'s ''[[Arnoldi Chronica Slavorum|Chronica Slavorum]]''.

'''What is hyperthreading?''' Hyperthreading is a feature that allows each CPU core to emulate two cores at once, or threads. On some Xeon Phi processors, Intel supports four-way hyperthreading, effectively quadrupling the number of threads. Prior to the Coffee Lake architecture, Core i3 and i7 supported hyperthreading. Post Coffee Lake, increased core counts mean that hyperthreading is not needed for Core i3, as it now has four physical cores. Core i7, being a higher-performance processor, still supports hyperthreading. Some Intel Pentiums support hyperthreading, but low-end Celerons do not.

'''CoreMark''' is a synthetic [[benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] that measures the performance of [[central processing unit]]s (CPU) used in [[embedded systems]]. It was developed in 2009 by Shay Gal-On at [[EEMBC]] and is intended to become an industry standard, replacing the antiquated [[Dhrystone]] benchmark.  The code is written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and contains implementations of the following algorithms: list processing (find and sort), [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] manipulation (common matrix operations), [[state machine]] (determine if an input stream contains valid numbers), and [[cyclic redundancy check|CRC]].

==Issues addressed by CoreMark==
The CRC algorithm serves a dual function; it provides a workload commonly seen in embedded applications and ensures correct operation of the CoreMark benchmark, essentially providing a self-checking mechanism.  Specifically, to verify correct operation, a 16-bit CRC is performed on the data contained in elements of the linked-list.

To ensure compilers cannot pre-compute the results at compile time every operation in the benchmark derives a value that is not available at compile time. Furthermore, all code used within the timed portion of the benchmark is part of the benchmark itself (no [[Library (computing)|library]] calls).

==CoreMark versus Dhrystone==
CoreMark draws on the strengths that made Dhrystone so resilient - it is small, portable, easy to understand, free, and displays a single number benchmark score. Unlike Dhrystone, CoreMark has specific run and reporting rules, and was designed to avoid the well understood issues that have been cited with [[Dhrystone]].

Major portions of Dhrystone are susceptible to a compiler’s ability to optimize the work away; thus it is more a compiler benchmark than a hardware benchmark. This also makes it very difficult to compare results when different compilers/flags are used.

Library calls are made within the timed portion of Dhrystone. Typically, those library calls consume the majority of the time consumed by the benchmark. Since the library code is not part of the benchmark, it is difficult to compare results if different libraries are used.
Guidelines exist on how to run Dhrystone but since results are not certified or verified, they are not enforced. There is no standardization on how Dhrystone results should be reported, with various formats in use (DMIPS, Dhrystones per second, DMIPS/MHz)

==Results==
CoreMark results can be found on the [http://www.eembc.org/coremark/index.php CoreMark web site], and on processor data sheets. 
Results are in the following format:

'''CoreMark 1.0 : N / C / P / M'''
	
* N Number of iterations per second with seeds 0,0,0x66,size=2000)
* C Compiler version and flags
* P Parameters such as data and code allocation specifics
* M - Type of [[Parallel algorithm]] execution (if used) and number of contexts

'''For example: ''' CoreMark 1.0 : 128 / GCC 4.1.2 -O2 -fprofile-use / Heap in TCRAM / FORK:2

The '''Culinary Heritage of Switzerland''' ({{lang-de|Kulinarisches Erbe der Schweiz}}, {{lang-fr|Patrimoine culinaire suisse}}, {{lang-it|Patrimonio culinario svizzero}}, {{lang-rm|Patrimoni culinar svizzer}}) is a multilingual online [[encyclopedia]] of traditional [[Swiss cuisine]] and [[produce]]. 

==History==
The project was initiated after Swiss MP [[Josef Zisyadis]]'s parliamentary motion in 2000.&lt;ref name="NZZaS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kulinarischeserbe.ch/downloads/NzzamSonntag12.2.06.pdf|title=Unser Ethno-Food|last=Merz|first=Andreas|date=12 December 2006|publisher=[[NZZ am Sonntag]]|language=German|accessdate=12 December 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706234522/http://www.kulinarischeserbe.ch/downloads/NzzamSonntag12.2.06.pdf|archivedate=6 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After obtaining [[Swiss franc|CHF]] 2 million of funding by the Swiss federal government, the [[Swiss cantons]] and private sponsors,&lt;ref name="Le Menu"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kulinarischeserbe.ch/downloads/Le%20Menu_Mai_2008.pdf|title=Schatzsuche zwischen Schabziger und Schafbock|last=Labhart|first=Gaby|date=1 May 2008|publisher=[[Le Menu]]|pages=33|language=German|accessdate=12 December 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706234615/http://www.kulinarischeserbe.ch/downloads/Le%20Menu_Mai_2008.pdf|archivedate=6 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the private association "Culinary Heritage of Switzerland" was founded in 2003. 

The association hired a team of researchers, including ethnologists and historians, to write the articles and carry out field research by interviewing Swiss bakers, butchers, cultural historians, archivists and farmer's wives.&lt;ref name="NZZaS" /&gt; It made the encyclopedia, with an initial scope of some 400 articles, available to the public on 9 December 2008 at no charge.&lt;ref name="Tagi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/leben/essen-und-trinken/Wer-das-Cordon-bleu-erfand-und-wieso-der-Gruyre-Schweizer-ist/story/26560377 |title=Wer das Cordon bleu erfand und wieso der Gruyère Schweizer ist [archive.org] |last=Imhof |first=Paul |date=9 December 2008 |publisher=[[Tages-Anzeiger]] |language=German |accessdate=12 December 2008 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130004657/http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/leben/essen-und-trinken/Wer-das-Cordon-bleu-erfand-und-wieso-der-Gruyre-Schweizer-ist/story/26560377 |archivedate=30 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
To be included in the association's database, a food must be recognised as traditionally Swiss, have been produced for at least 40 years and remain in production.&lt;ref name="NZZaS" /&gt; The project's scope is limited to processed foodstuffs, such as cheeses or meat products. It does not include unprocessed food (with a few exceptions), wines, recipes or dishes.

The '''Professor Kazimierz Michałowski Faras Gallery at the National Museum in Warsaw''' is a permanent gallery at the [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum in Warsaw]], presenting [[Nubia]]n early [[Christian art]]. The Gallery features a unique collection of [[Mural|wall paintings]] and architectural elements from the [[Faras Cathedral]], discovered by an [[Archaeology|archeological]] mission led by Professor [[Kazimierz Michałowski]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/898253572|title=Galeria Faras im.

==History of the gallery==
===Excavations at Faras===
[[File:Excavations at Faras 067.jpg|thumb|Excavations at Faras – wall painting on site]]
Most of the artworks shown in the Faras Gallery found their way there thanks to the archaeologists participating in the international effort to save the remains of old Nile basin cultures, known as the Nubian Campaign. The Nubian Campaign took place between 1961 and 1964 and was initiated by [[UNESCO]]. During the excavations the archaeologists discovered well-preserved ruins of places of worship, layered one over another, within the area of the city [[Faras]] (ancient Pachoras), next to the [[Sudan]]ian-[[Egypt]]ian border. The buildings originated from between the 7th and 14th centuries, and were decorated with wall paintings depicting Christian religious themes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Removal of the wall paintings===
In order to remove the wall paintings from the cathedral walls and move them to specially prepared screens, it was necessary to secure and reinforce the surface to prevent cracking. To do this, the faces of paintings were covered with sheets of [[japanese tissue]] paper and impregnated with a thick mix of wax-rosin. Upper parts of the paintings were secured by pressing stripes of [[canvas]] into them. Next, fragments of [[plaster]] with the paintings attached to them were cut off from walls using knives and saws. The removed paintings were then moved onto wooden screens. It was necessary to remove excess plaster from the backs of paintings and to reinforce the paintings with gypsum.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The artworks were wrapped in cotton blankets and transported to museums in [[Warsaw]] and [[Khartoum]]. There they underwent a complex restoration process and were prepared for exhibition. The protective layers were then removed, original plaster was removed from the reverse sides of paintings, and a thin (ok. 2–3&amp;nbsp;mm) layer was moved to an artificial background.

===Transporting the artworks===
67 paintings and many other objects discovered in Faras have been transported to Poland. The first group of artworks arrived at the Museum in 1962.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The collection held by the [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum in Warsaw]] is the largest and most valuable set of archaeological heritage found outside Poland residing in Polish museum collections.

===Other discoveries===
[[File:Faras - Restoration in MNW-01.jpg|thumb|left|Restoration works at the National Museum in Warsaw, mid-1960s]][[File:Excavations at Faras 010.jpg|thumb|Excavations at Faras]]
The Nubian Campaign generated scientific interest in Sudan and its ancient cultures. Polish archaeologists have conducted numerous excavations and research expeditions in [[Old Dongola]], the capital of [[Makuria]], [[Banganarti]] or the IVth region of [[Nile]] cataract. These expeditions considerably expanded the original collection of the Faras Gallery.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

===The opening of Faras Gallery===
The Faras Gallery at the National Museum in Warsaw was opened to the public in 1972, and accompanied by the first [[nubiology]] congress and the announcement of a new scientific discipline: nubiology.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

===The rearrangement of the Gallery in 2014===
On 17 October 2014 the renovated and rearranged Faras Gallery was reopened.&lt;ref name="rp.pl"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rp.pl/artykul/1149714-Otwarcie-Galerii-Faras-w-Muzeum-Narodowym-w-Warszawie.html#ap-1|title=Otwarcie Galerii Faras w Muzeum Narodowym w Warszawie - Sztuka - rp.pl|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the architectural design and modernised concept of the gallery space are Mirosław Orzechowski and Grzegorz Rytel. The exhibition is curated by Bożena Mierzejewska. The modernisation was funded by Wojciech Pawłowski.&lt;ref name="rp.pl"/&gt; The Faras Gallery was reopened under the auspices of UNESCO and the [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Poland)|Minister of Culture and National Heritage]] Małgorzata Omilanowska.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Exhibition==
===Room I: The First Cathedral at Faras===
[[File:Blok fryzu z absydy I Katedry, warsztat nubijsk.jpg|thumb|Frieze block from the First Cathedral, Room I]]
Room I presents objects found at the [[Faras Cathedral]], such as the frieze fragment from the apse of the First Cathedral; the founding inscription of bishop Paulos (commemorating the renovation of the Cathedral in 707 AD, "a holy Catholic place and a church of the Apostles of God"), stone blocks with inscriptions, and other elements. These objects are directly related to the history of the cathedral and its numerous building stages, happening from the 7th until the 14th century. The Cathedral was built on the foundations of an older church, built in the beginning of the 7th century AD.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

===Rooms II and III: multimedia space===
[[File:MNW-Faras Gallery 15.jpeg|thumb|Faras Gallery Room IV]]
In rooms II and III the visitors can view films on the history of discoveries, Nubia and the Nubian Campaign, as well as individual paintings, their style and iconography. Also shown are the photographs of the archaeological campaigns and the photographs of artworks which were transferred to the [[National Museum of Sudan]]. Another presentation concerns professor [[Kazimierz Michałowski]], the archaeologist who discovered the Faras Cathedral, and the patron of the gallery.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

===Room V: objects related to burial customs===
[[File:MNW-Faras Gallery 06.jpeg|thumb|Faras Gallery Room VI]]
This room contains the objects related to the burial of Faras [[bishop]]s. Most of the objects were found in the burial chambers or grave constructions. The objects include [[epitaph]]s, water containers or chest crosses, which were buried with the bishops.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

Sixteen bishops of Faras had been buried in the close vicinity of the Cathedral or inside it. Information about their identity was provided by the texts of epitaphs written in Greek or [[Coptic language|Coptic]]. Many epitaphs feature texts of prayers for the bishops. In Room V there are numerous examples of these epitaphs, including the epitaph of Bishop Ignatios, Bishop Maththaios, and Bishop Stephanos.

===Room VI: the Cathedral===
[[File:Autor nieznany, św. Anna - fragment postaci. Malowidło ścienne.jpg|thumb|Saint Anne - wall painting presented in room VI]]
The Room VI is designed to evoke the character of a temple, with arcades forming subsequent annexes in which the wall paintings are presented. The spatial arrangement is similar to that of the [[Faras Cathedral]]. The arcades are complemented by an [[apse]]. This room contains wall paintings removed from the walls of the nartex, northern nave and presbytery. The paintings have been created between the 7th and 14th centuries and were found on various layers of plaster (due to multiple stages of building of the Cathedral and covering the walls with newer images). The wall paintings are images of [[Jesus|Christ]], [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[angel]]s and archangels, saints, bishops and rulers. They are painted [[Fresco-secco|al secco]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Faras. Malowidła ścienne w zbiorach Muzeum Narodowego w Warszawie|last=Michałowski|first=Kazimierz|publisher=Wydawnictwo Artystyczno-graficzne|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most characteristic paintings presented in this room are: [[Saint Anne (wall painting)|Saint Anne]], Archangels Michael and Gabriel, bishops Marianos and Petros, various iconographic representations of Mary, and others.

===Room VIII: objects from Nubia and Christian Egypt===

Ceramics and pottery frequently constitute a majority of archaeological finds at excavation sites. The majority of finds in the case of the Faras expedition dates from the Christian period. In that time (650–1000 AD) Faras was the most important manufacturing centre for ceramics in northern [[Nubia]]. This activity came to a halt in the 10th century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The gallery presents also Coptic [[Pottery|ceramics]] as well as ceramics from earlier periods. All the items originate from Faras and the IVth Nile cataract.

Another collection is that of Coptic [[textile]]s, originating from Christian-era Egypt. This collection arrived at the National Museum in Warsaw in the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century thanks to antiquarians and private collectors.

===Presentations of Faras art from the National Museum in Warsaw collection outside the Faras Gallery===

Among these is the image of Archangel Michael and a Faras archbishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnw.art.pl/kolekcje/zbiory-studyjne/zbiory-sztuki-starozytnej-i-wschodniochrzescijanskiej/kolekcja-sztuki-nubijskiej/|title=Kolekcja Sztuki Nubijskiej / Zbiory Sztuki Starożytnej i Wschodniochrześcijańskiej / Zbiory / Kolekcje / Muzeum Narodowe|last=Warszawie|first=Muzeum Narodowe w|website=www.mnw.art.pl|language=pl|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Haps Magazine''''', also known as "HAPS", is an English online magazine located in [[Busan]], [[South Korea]] that focuses on lifestyle, entertainment and expat life on the [[Korean peninsula]]. It was founded in 2009 and has become one of Korea's most popular English resources for news and information.

While the focus of the magazine is mostly on events and happenings around the Busan and southeastern areas of Korea, the magazine has claimed some international fame for some of its articles. Editor-in-Chief Bobby McGill's report on [[K-pop]] singer [[ Psy ]]'s past anti-American actions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/12/08/gangnam-rile-psys-past-anti-american-performances-stir-controversy/ |title=Gangnam Rile: Psy’s Past Anti-American Performances Stir Controversy &amp;#124; TIME.com |publisher=Newsfeed.time.com |date=2012-12-08 |accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw numerous international media outlets including [[Time (magazine)|TIME]], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and the ''[[New York Post]]'' help break the story which made the "[[Gangnam Style]]" legend &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/12/07/gangnam-style-rapper-psy-apologizes-for-lyrics-about-killing-americans/ |title=‘Gangnam Style’ Rapper Psy Apologizes For Lyrics About Killing Americans - Speakeasy - WSJ |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=2012-12-07 |accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; apologize for his actions.

HAPS also received more international attention when a report about South Korean baseball player [[Kim Tae-kyun (baseball, born 1982)|Kim Tae-kyun]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yoo Jee-ho |url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/fullstory/2013/06/11/3/4500000000AEN20130611003100315F.HTML |title=KBO slugger Kim Tae-kyun apologizes for insensitive remarks on African-American pitcher |publisher=GlobalPost |date=2013-06-11 |accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; made insensitive remarks towards African-American pitcher Shane Youman. The report helped contribute to the [[National Human Rights Commission of Korea]] demanding [[Sensitivity training | sensitivity training education ]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrightskorea.org/2013/baseball-player-kim-tae-kyun-apologizes-for-his-discriminatory-remarks/ |title=South Korean Human Rights Monitor &amp;#124; Baseball Player Kim Tae Kyun Apologizes for his Discriminatory Remarks - South Korean Human Rights Monitor |publisher=Humanrightskorea.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; to prevent similar racial discrimination remarks among sports professionals in Korea.

==History==
''HAPS'' was established in June 2009 in the [[ Haeundae District ]] in Busan. The print publication ceased to exist in November, 2016 and now focuses only on online content, including adding a Korean language section.

==Awards==
''HAPS'' was voted the "Best City Magazine" in Korea at the 2014 K-blog awards &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaobserver.com/blogawards/ |title=Winners and Finalists of the 2014 K-Blog Awards - K-Blog Awards - Discover the Best Blogs of the Year |publisher=Koreaobserver.com |date=2014-07-21 |accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; held by the ''Korean Observer''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5630">The '''International Soundex Reunion Registry''', Inc. is a [[501(c)3]] non-profit, tax exempt, humanitarian organization founded in 1975 by [[Emma May Vilardi]]. ISRR is a free mutual consent [[adoption reunion registry]] for persons desiring a reunion with next-of-kin. This agency serves the needs of family members who have been separated from each other by adoption, divorce, foster care, abandonment, or other means.

The registries filing system was based originally on [[Soundex]] Code which is a phonetic way of coding giving numeric value to consonants and  ignores vowels, except as a first letter. This system allows for matching despite some differences in spelling. It was a perfect foundation for a situation where often people did not know exact spelling.

The founder, Emma May Vilardi, was a remarkable woman of extraordinary vision and courage who undertook this important, humane task of providing a safe and secure way for persons seeking contact to make themselves available to each other. This registry remains her legacy to the adoption community and the hundreds of thousands served. "It was not until Emma began looking for the reasons behind the many illnesses that she had suffered that she learned that ancestors and genetics were the key to understanding her health problems. Daring a probate judge to unseal an adoption record, she quickly learned that her ancestors had succumbed to the same diseases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | publisher = [[American Adoption Congress]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ISRR Executive Board of Trustees is responsible for ensuring the operation of the registry for future generations. The registry motto is, "United today for the reunions of tomorrow." For many it remains a place of hope when they feel all other resources have been exhausted, for others it was a quick and easy step that led them to connect with family members they longed to know.

Now one of many existing adoption reunion registries, Soundex is the oldest and largest of its kind. It served as a model for many state registries, for Senator [[Carl Levin]]'s [[U.S. Senate]] Bill's in the 1980s trying to establish a national adoption registry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the abundance of online registries established to help adoptees and birth family member find each other.

The adoption reform movement groups supported ISRR and recommended their members register. Most state registries, agencies and courts also refer directly to ISRR as an option for those seeking reunification with family. There are many articles and references archived in newsletters, clippings and other resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.triadoption.com/newsletters.htm
 | title = Newsletters
 | publisher = TRIADOPTION
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Registration at ISRR is free because of the donations made by registrants, and the time given by volunteers. 

''[[Dear Abby]]'' referred to ISRR many times over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | url = http://www.isrr.net/History/After%201st%20Dear%20Abby.pdf
 | title = After 1st Dear Abby Article

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One story is of an adoptee who registered 20 years to the day of when his birthmother's registration arrived. Both had read the same ''Dear Abby'' article. The adoptee had carried it in his wallet for twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.isrr.net/articles.htm/
 | title = Articles
 | publisher = International Soundex Reunion Registry
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There are around 225,000 active registrations, at any given time. ISRR was paper based until 2003, when the volunteers began an imaging project that took five years to complete. Now all forms are digitized.

Islam ({{lang-ar|إسلام}}, {{IPA-ar|alʔɪsˈlaːm|IPA|ar-al_islam.ogg}}) is a verbal noun originating from the [[Semitic root|triliteral root]] [[S-L-M]] which forms a large class of words mostly relating to concepts of wholeness, submission, safeness, and peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studyquran.co.uk/20_SIIN.htm Dictionary listing for Siin roots] derived from ''Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon'' via www.studyquran.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; In a religious context it means "voluntary submission to God".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=IVyMAvW9slYC|page=8}} |author1=Lewis, Barnard |author2=Churchill, Buntzie Ellis |title=Islam: The Religion and The People|publisher=Wharton School Publishing|page=8 |isbn=9780132230858|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qaem.org/wp/what-does-islam-mean/|title=What does Islam mean?|website=The Friday Journal|date=2011-02-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314072458/http://www.qaem.org/wp/what-does-islam-mean/|archivedate=2011-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[wikt:إسلام#Arabic|Islām]]'' is the verbal noun of [[wikt:أسلم#Arabic|Form IV]] of the root, and means "submission" or "surrender". ''[[Muslim]]'', the word for an adherent of Islam, is the [[active participle]] of the same verb form, and means "submitter" or "one who surrenders". The word sometimes has distinct connotations in its various occurrences in the [[Quran]]. In some verses, there is stress on the quality of Islam as an internal spiritual state: "Whomsoever God desires to guide, He opens his heart to Islam."&lt;ref name="MULTIPLE-REFERENCES"&gt;

Islam was historically called [[Mohammedan|Muhammadanism]] in [[Anglophone]] societies. This term has fallen out of use and is sometimes said to be [[Religious offense|offensive]] because it suggests that a human being rather than God is central to Muslims' religion, parallel to [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/ataglance/glance.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Buddhism: Buddhism at a glance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors, however, continue to use the term ''Muhammadanism'' as a [[wikt:technical term|technical term]] for the religious system as opposed to the [[theological]] concept of Islam that exists within that system.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth G. Wilson, ''The Columbia Guide to Standard American English'' ({{ISBN|0231069898}}), page 291: Muhammadan and Mohammedan are based on the name of the prophet Mohammed, and both are considered offensive.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Articles of faith==

{{Main|Aqidah|Iman (concept)|l2=Iman}}
[[Faith]] ([[Iman (concept)|Iman]]) in the Islamic [[creed]] ([[Aqidah]]) is often represented as the [[Iman (concept)#The six articles of the Islamic faith|six articles of faith]], notably spelled out in the [[Hadith of Gabriel]].

===Concept of God===

Islam is often seen as having the simplest doctrines of the major religions.&lt;ref name=USNewsLippman /&gt; Its most fundamental concept is a rigorous monotheism, called [[tawḥīd]] ({{lang-ar|توحيد}}). God is described in chapter 112 of the Quran as: "Say, He is God, the One and Only; God, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him" ({{cite quran|112|1–4|style=nosup|expand=no}}).&lt;ref&gt;

===Angels===
{{Main|Angels in Islam}}
[[File:Mohammed receiving revelation from the angel Gabriel.jpg|thumb|right|Muhammad receiving his first revelation from the angel [[Gabriel]]. From the manuscript ''[[Jami' al-tawarikh]]'' by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]], 1307, [[Ilkhanate]] period.]]
Belief in [[angel]]s is fundamental to the faith of Islam. The Arabic word for angel ({{lang-ar|ملك}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|malak}}'') means "[[Courier|messenger]]", like its counterparts in [[Hebrew]] (''malʾákh'') and [[Greek language|Greek]] (''angelos''). [[Angels]] do not possess any bodily desire and are not subject to temptations such as eating, drinking or procreation. Angels' duties include communicating [[revelation]]s from God, glorifying God, recording every person's actions, and taking a person's [[soul]] at the time of death. Muslims believe that angels are made of light. They are described as "messengers with wings—two, or three, or four (pairs): He [God] adds to Creation as He pleases..."&lt;ref&gt;

* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Angel | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an Online | author=Gisela Webb | ref=harv }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have emphasized a metaphorical reinterpretation of the concept of angels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|first=Nidhal |last=Guessoum|title=Islam's Quantum Question: Reconciling Muslim Tradition and Modern Science|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=zaL3AgAAQBAJ|page=165}}|date=30 October 2010|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85773-075-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pictorial depictions of angels are generally avoided in Islamic art, as the idea of giving form to anything immaterial is not accepted.&lt;ref name="Baksh2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kaiyume Baksh|title=Islam and Other Major World Religions|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=CFKYFcosJUsC|page=163}}|year=2007|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4251-1303-2|pages=163–}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=November 2018}} Muslims therefore do not generally share the perceptions of angelic pictorial depictions, such as those found in Western art.

===Revelations===

{{See also|History of the Quran}}
[[File:FirstSurahKoran_(fragment).jpg|thumb|right|The first [[Sura|chapter]] of the Quran, ''[[Al-Fatiha]]'' (''The Opening''), is seven verses]]
The Islamic holy books are the records which most Muslims believe were dictated by God to various prophets. [[Muslim]]s believe that parts of the previously revealed scriptures, the ''[[Tawrat]]'' ([[Torah]]) and the ''[[Injil]]'' ([[Gospel in Islam|Gospel]]), had become [[tahrif|distorted]]—either in interpretation, in text, or both.&lt;ref name="Distorted"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quran]] (literally, "Recitation") is viewed by Muslims as the final revelation and literal word of God and is widely regarded as the finest [[Arabic literature|literary]] work in the classical [[Arabic language]].&lt;ref&gt;Chejne, A. (1969) The Arabic Language: Its Role in History, University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Speicher, K. (1997) in: Edzard, L., and Szyska, C. (eds.) Encounters of Words and Texts: Intercultural Studies in Honor of Stefan Wild. Georg Olms, Hildesheim, pp. 43–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims believe that the verses of the Quran were revealed to [[Muhammad]] by God through the [[Holy Spirit (Islam)|archangel Gabriel]] (''Jibrīl'') on many occasions between 610 CE until his death on June 8, 632.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Esposito|2004|pp=17,18,21}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Muhammad was alive, all of these revelations were written down by his companions (''[[sahabah]]''), although the prime method of transmission was orally through [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorization]].&lt;ref name="al faruqi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Al Faruqi|author2=Lois Ibsen|title=The Cantillation of the Qur'an|journal=Asian Music|year=1987|issue=Autumn – Winter 1987|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran is divided into 114 chapters (''[[sura]]s'') which combined, contain 6,236 verses (''[[ayah|āyāt]]''). The chronologically earlier suras, revealed at [[Mecca]], are primarily concerned with ethical and spiritual topics. The later [[Medina]]n suras mostly discuss social and legal issues relevant to the Muslim community.&lt;ref&gt;
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Islam | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | ref=harv }}
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Qur'an | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | ref=harv }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran is more concerned with moral guidance than legislation, and is considered the "sourcebook of Islamic principles and values".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Esposito|2004|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim jurists consult the ''hadith'' ("reports"), or the written record of Prophet Muhammad's life, to both supplement the Quran and assist with its interpretation. The science of Quranic commentary and exegesis is known as ''[[tafsir]]''.&lt;ref&gt;
* {{Harvtxt|Esposito|2004|pp=79–81}}
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Tafsir | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | ref=harv }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The set of rules governing proper [[elocution]] of recitation is called ''[[tajwid]]''.

Muslims usually view "the Quran" as the original scripture as revealed in Arabic and that any translations are necessarily deficient, which are regarded only as commentaries on the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;
* {{Harvtxt|Teece|2003|pp=12,13}}
* {{Harvtxt|Turner|2006|p=42}}
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Qur'an | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | ref=harv }}: The word ''Quran'' was invented and first used in the Qurʼan itself. There are [[Quran#Etymology and meaning|two different theories]] about this term and its formation.

===Prophets and sunnah===
{{Main|Prophets and messengers in Islam|Sunnah|Hadith}}
[[File:Medieval Persian manuscript Muhammad leads Abraham Moses Jesus.jpg|thumb|A Persian miniature depicts Muhammad leading [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]] and others in prayer.]]

Muslims identify the 'prophets' ({{lang-ar|أنبياء}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|anbiyāʾ}}'' ) of Islam as those humans chosen by God to be his messengers. According to the Quran, the prophets were instructed by God to bring the "will of God" to the peoples of the nations. Muslims believe that prophets are human and not divine, though some are able to perform miracles to prove their claim. [[Schools of Islamic theology|Islamic theology]] says that all of God's messengers preached the message of Islam—submission to the will of God. The Quran mentions the names of numerous figures considered [[prophets in Islam]], including [[Adam]], [[Noah in Islam|Noah]], [[Abraham]], [[Moses in Islam|Moses]] and [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;
* {{Harvtxt|Momem|1987|p=176}}{{cnf|date=December 2017}}
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Islam | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | ref=harv }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims believe that God finally sent Muhammad as the last law-bearing prophet (''[[Seal of the prophets]]'') to convey the divine message to the whole world (to sum up and to finalize the word of God). In Islam, the "normative" example of Muhammad's life is called the [[Sunnah]] (literally "trodden path"). Muslims are encouraged to emulate Muhammad's actions in their daily lives and the Sunnah is seen as crucial to guiding interpretation of the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;* ''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World'' (2003), p.666* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Hadith | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | author=J. Robson | ref=harv}}* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Sunna | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | author=D. W. Brown | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This example is preserved in traditions known as hadith, which recount his words, his actions, and his personal characteristics. Hadith Qudsi is a sub-category of hadith, regarded as verbatim words of God quoted by Muhammad but is not part of the Quran.

A hadith involves two elements: a chain of narrators, called [[Hadith studies#Sanad and matn|sanad]], and the actual wording, called [[Hadith studies#Sanad and matn|matn]]. Hadiths can be classified, by studying the narration, as "authentic" or "correct", called ''[[Hadith terminology#Ṣaḥīḥ|Sahih]]'' ({{lang-ar|صَحِيْح}}), "good", called ''[[Hadith terminology#Ḥasan|Ḥasan]]'' ({{lang-ar|حَسَن}}) or "weak", called ''[[Hadith terminology#Ḍaʻīf|Ḍaʻīf]]'' ({{lang-ar|ضَعِيْف}}) among others.

===Resurrection and judgment===
{{Main|Islamic eschatology}}

Belief in the "Day of Resurrection", ''[[Qiyamah|Yawm al-Qiyāmah]]'' ({{lang-ar|يوم القيامة}}) is also crucial for Muslims. They believe the time of ''Qiyāmah'' is preordained by God but unknown to man. The trials and [[tribulation]]s preceding and during the ''Qiyāmah'' are described in the Quran and the hadith, and also in the commentaries of [[Ulama|scholars]]. The Quran emphasizes [[Resurrection of the Dead|bodily resurrection]], a break from the [[pre-Islamic Arabia]]n understanding of death.&lt;ref&gt;
* "Resurrection", ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'' (2003)
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Avicenna | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | ref=harv }}: Ibn Sīnā, Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥusayn b. ʿAbd Allāh b. Sīnā is known in the West as "Avicenna".
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Qiyama | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | author=L. Gardet | ref=harv }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

On Yawm al-Qiyāmah, Muslims believe all humankind will be judged on their good and bad deeds and consigned to ''[[Jannah]]'' (paradise) or ''[[Jahannam]]'' (hell). The Qurʼan in Surat al-Zalzalah describes this as, "So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it (99:7) and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it (99:8)." The Qurʼan [[Islamic views of sin|lists several sins]] that can condemn a person to [[hell]], such as [[Kafir|disbelief]] in God ({{lang-ar|كفر}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kufr}}''), and dishonesty; however, the Qurʼan makes it clear God will forgive the [[Islamic views on sin|sins]] of those who repent if he so wills. Good deeds, such as charity, prayer and compassion towards animals,&lt;ref&gt;Animals in Islam By Basheer Ahmad Masri Page 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam:Second Edition: Second Edition By John L. Esposito Page 130&lt;/ref&gt; will be rewarded with entry to heaven. Muslims view [[jannah|heaven]] as a place of joy and blessings, with Qurʼanic references describing its features. Mystical traditions in Islam place these heavenly delights in the context of an ecstatic awareness of God.&lt;ref&gt;

* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Paradise | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | ref=harv }}
&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yawm al-Qiyāmah'' is also identified in the Quran as ''Yawm ad-Dīn'' ({{lang-ar|يوم الدين}}), "Day of Religion";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|1|4|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''as-sāʿah'' ({{lang-ar|الساعة}}), "the Last Hour";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|6|31|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''al-Qāriʿah'' ({{lang-ar|القارعة}}), "The Clatterer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|101|1|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic eschatology|Islamic apocalyptic literature]] describing [[Armageddon]] is often known as ''[[Fitna (word)|fitna]]'' or ''[[Al-Malhama Al-Kubra|malahim]]''. A common expectation depicts Armageddon with the arrival of the [[Mahdi]] (prophesied redeemer) who will be sent and with the help of [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]], to battle [[Al-Masih ad-Dajjal|the Antichrist]]. They will triumph, liberating Islam from cruelty, and this will be followed by a time of serenity with people living true to religious values.&lt;ref name="Mahdi1"&gt;{{cite book|last = Yahya | first = Harun | authorlink = | author2 = | title = Portents And Features of the Mahdi's Coming | publisher =  Global Publishing.

===Divine will===
{{Main|Predestination in Islam}}
The concept of divine will is referred to as ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-qadāʾ wa l-qadar}}'', which literally derives from a root that means ''to measure''. Everything, good and bad, is believed to have been decreed.&lt;ref&gt;*{{Harvtxt|Cohen-Mor|2001|p=4}}: "The idea of predestination is reinforced by the frequent mention of events 'being written' or 'being in a book' before they happen: 'Say: "Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us..."&amp;nbsp;'&amp;nbsp;"* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Fate | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an Online | author=Ahmet T. Karamustafa | ref=harv }}: The verb ''qadara'' literally means "to measure, to determine". Here it is used to mean that "God measures and orders his creation".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acts of worship==
{{See also|Five Pillars of Islam}}
There are five basic religious acts in Islam, collectively known as 'The Pillars of Islam' (''arkan al-Islam''; also ''arkan ad-din'', "pillars of religion"), which are considered obligatory for all believers. The Quran presents them as a framework for worship and a sign of commitment to the faith. They are (1) the creed ([[Shahada]]), (2) daily prayers ([[Salah]]), (3) almsgiving ([[Zakat]]), (4) fasting during [[Ramadan]] ([[Fasting in Islam|Sawm]]) and (5) the pilgrimage to Mecca ([[Hajj]]) at least once in a lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hajj – ReligionFacts|url = http://www.religionfacts.com/hajj|website = www.religionfacts.com|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] sects agree on the essential details for the performance of these acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1859?_hi=32&amp;_pos=3 Pillars of Islam], Oxford Islamic Studies Online&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from these, Muslims also perform other religious acts. Notable among them are charity ([[Sadaqah]]) and [[Quran reading|recitation of the Quran]].

===Testimony===
{{main|Shahadah}}
[[File:Silver Rupee Akbar.jpg|thumb|right|Silver coin of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]], inscribed with the ''Shahadah'']]

&lt;/ref&gt; which is the basic [[creed]] of Islam that must be recited under [[oath]] with the specific statement: "''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾašhadu ʾal-lā ʾilāha ʾillā-llāhu wa ʾašhadu ʾanna muħammadan rasūlu-llāh}}''", or "I testify that there is no god but [[God in Islam|God]], Muhammad is the messenger of God"&lt;ref&gt;N Mohammad (1985), The doctrine of jihad: An introduction, Journal of Law and Religion, 3(2): 381–397&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang|ar|أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله وأن محمدا رسول الله}}). This testament is a foundation for all other beliefs and practices in Islam. Muslims must repeat the ''shahadah'' in prayer, and non-Muslims wishing to [[convert to Islam]] are required to recite the creed.&lt;ref&gt;

Ritual prayers are called Ṣalāh or Ṣalāt ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: [[Wikt:صلاة|صلاة]]). Salat is intended to focus the mind on God, and is seen as a personal communication with him that expresses gratitude and [[worship]]. Performing prayers five times a day is compulsory but flexibility in the timing specifics is allowed depending on circumstances. The prayers are recited in the [[Arabic language]], and consist of verses from the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The prayers are done with the chest in direction of the [[kaaba]] though in the early days of Islam, they were done in direction of [[Jerusalem]]. The act of supplicating is referred to as [[dua]].

A [[Mosque]] is a [[places of worship|place of worship]] for Muslims, who often refer to it by its Arabic name ''masjid''.

===Charity===
{{main|Zakat|Sadaqah}}

"Zakāt" ({{lang-ar|زكاة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|zakāh}}'' "[[wikt:alms|alms]]") is giving a fixed portion of accumulated wealth by those who can afford it to help the poor or needy and for those employed to collect Zakat; also, for bringing hearts together, freeing captives, for those in debt (or [[bonded labour]]) and for the (stranded) traveller.&lt;ref&gt;Qurʼan, Surat al-Tawbah 9:60 "Zakat expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed to collect (Zakat) and for bringing hearts together and for freeing captives and for those in debt (or [[bonded labour]]) and for the cause of Allah and for the (stranded) traveller – an obligation (imposed) by Allah .

{{Further|Fasting during Ramadan}}
Fasting ({{lang-ar|صوم}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ṣawm}}'') from food and drink, among other things, must be performed from dawn to dusk during the month of [[Ramadan]]. The fast is to encourage a feeling of nearness to God, and during it Muslims should express their gratitude for and dependence on him, atone for their past sins, develop self-control and restraint and think of the needy. ''Sawm'' is not obligatory for several groups for whom it would constitute an undue burden. For others, flexibility is allowed depending on circumstances, but missed fasts must be compensated for later.&lt;ref&gt;

The obligatory Islamic [[pilgrimage]], called the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥajj}}'' ({{lang-ar|حج}}), has to be performed during the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic month]] of ''[[Dhu al-Hijjah]]'' in the city of Mecca. Every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it must make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in his or her lifetime. Rituals of the Hajj include: spending a day and a night in the tents in the desert plain of Mina, then a day in the desert plain of Arafat praying and worshiping God, following the foot steps of Abraham; then spending a night out in the open, sleeping on the desert sand in the desert plain of Muzdalifah; then moving to Jamarat, symbolically [[Stoning of the Devil|stoning the Devil]] recounting Abraham's actions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=4xIijTTxX9UC|page=279}}|title=Getting the Best Out of Hajj By Abu Muneer Ismail Davids|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014|isbn=9789960980300|author1=Davids|first1=Abu Muneer Ismail|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=HYJ2c9E9IM8C|page=19}}|title=Islam: A Guide for Jews and Christians By F.

Sharia is the [[religious law]] forming part of the Islamic tradition.&lt;ref name=oxforddic&gt;{{cite web|title=British &amp; World English: sharia|url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/sharia|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=4 December 2015|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the religious precepts of Islam, particularly the [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]]. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the term ''sharīʿah'' refers to God's divine law and is contrasted with ''[[fiqh]]'', which refers to its scholarly interpretations.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;&lt;ref name=vikor&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|ref=harv |first=Knut S.|last=Vikør|title=Sharīʿah|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Politics|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor=Emad El-Din Shahin|year=2014|url=http://bridgingcultures.neh.gov/muslimjourneys/items/show/226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manner of its application in modern times has been a subject of dispute between Muslim traditionalists and reformists.&lt;ref name=oxforddic/&gt;

Traditional [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|theory of Islamic jurisprudence]] recognizes four [[sources of sharia]]: the Quran, ''[[sunnah]]'' (Hadith and [[prophetic biography|Sira]]), ''[[qiyas]]'' (analogical reasoning), and ''[[ijma]]'' (juridical consensus).&lt;ref name="Esposito, John 2001"&gt;{{cite book|first1=John L. |last1=Esposito|authorlink1=John Esposito|first2=Natana J. |last2=DeLong-Bas|authorlink2=Natana J.

Historically, sharia was interpreted by independent jurists ([[mufti]]s). Their legal opinions ([[fatwa]]s) were taken into account by ruler-appointed [[Qadi|judges]] who presided over ''[[qāḍī]]'s'' courts, and by ''maẓālim'' courts, which were controlled by the ruler's council and administered criminal law.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;&lt;ref name=vikor/&gt; In the modern era, sharia-based criminal laws were widely replaced by statutes inspired by European models.&lt;ref name=vikor/&gt; While the constitutions of most Muslim-majority states contain references to sharia, its classical rules were largely retained only in [[Status (law)|personal status]] (family) laws.&lt;ref name=vikor/&gt; Legislative bodies which codified these laws sought to modernize them without abandoning their foundations in traditional jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=vikor/&gt;&lt;ref name=mayer&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|ref=harv |first=Ann Elizabeth|last=Mayer|title=Law.

===Scholars===

{{Main|Ulama}}

Islam, like Judaism, has no clergy in the [[sacerdotal]] sense, such as priests who mediate between God and people. However, there are many terms in Islam to refer to religiously sanctioned positions of Islam. In the broadest sense, the term ''ulema'' ({{lang-ar| علماء}}) is used to describe the body of Muslim scholars who have completed several years of training and study of [[Islamic studies|Islamic sciences]]. A jurist who interprets Islamic law is called a [[mufti]] ({{lang-ar|مفتي}}) and often issues judicial opinions, called [[fatwa]]s. A scholar of jurisprudence is called a [[faqih]] ({{lang-ar|فقيه}}). Someone who studies the science of hadith is called a [[muhaddith]]. A [[qadi]] is a judge in an Islamic court. [[Honorific]] titles given to scholars include [[shiekh]], [[mullah]] and [[maulvi]]. [[Imam]] ({{lang-ar|إمام}}) is a leadership position, often used in the context of conducting Islamic worship services.

===Schools of jurisprudence===
[[File:Madhhab Map3.png|thumb|right|250px|[[madh'hab|Schools of law]] across the [[Muslim world]]]]
{{Main|Madhhab}}
A school of jurisprudence is referred to as a ''madhab'' ({{lang-ar|مذهب}}). The four major Sunni schools are the [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] and sometimes [[Ẓāhirī]] while the two major Shia schools are [[Ja'fari]] and [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]]. Each differ in their methodology, called [[Usul al-fiqh]]. The following of decisions by a religious expert without necessarily examining the decision's reasoning is called [[taqlid]]. The term ''ghair muqallid'' literally refers to those who do not use taqlid and by extension do not have a [[madhab]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedeia of Eminent Thinkers – Page 38, K. S. Bharathi – 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of an individual interpretating law with independent reasoning is called [[ijtihad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Weiss|2002|pp=3,161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
{{Main|Islamic economics}}

To reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, [[Islamic economic jurisprudence]] encourages trade,&lt;ref&gt;
* International Business Success in a Strange Cultural Environment By Mamarinta P. Mababaya Page 203
* {{Cite quran|4|29|style=ref}}
&lt;/ref&gt; discourages the hoarding of wealth and outlaws interest-bearing loans ([[usury]]; the term is ''[[riba]]'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Islamic Moral Economy: A Study of Islamic Money and Financial Instruments | author=Karim, Shafiel A. | year=2010 | publisher=Brown Walker Press | location=Boca Raton, FL | isbn=978-1-59942-539-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Financial Regulation in Crisis?: The Role of Law and the Failure of Northern Rock By Joanna Gray, Orkun Akseli Page 97&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, wealth is taxed through [[Zakat]], but trade is not taxed. [[Usury]], which allows the rich to get richer without sharing in the risk, is forbidden in Islam. Profit sharing and venture capital where the lender is also exposed to risk is acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The taking of land belonging to others is also prohibited. The prohibition of [[usury]] has resulted in the development of [[Islamic banking]]. During the time of Muhammad, any money that went to the state, was immediately used to help the poor. Then in 634, [[Umar]] formally established the welfare state [[Bayt al-mal]]. The [[Bayt al-mal]] or the welfare state was for the Muslim and Non-Muslim poor, needy, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled. The [[Bayt al-mal]] ran for hundreds of years under the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] in the 7th century and continued through the [[Umayyad]] period and well into the [[Abbasid]] era. Umar also introduced Child Benefit and Pensions for the children and the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Muhammad |last=Al-Buraey|title=Administrative Development: An Islamic Perspective|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=HJE9AAAAIAAJ|page=254}}|year=1985|publisher=KPI|isbn=978-0-7103-0333-2|pages=254–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The challenge of Islamic renaissance By Syed Abdul Quddus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Buraey1985"&gt;{{cite book|first=Muhammad |last=Al-Buraey|title=Administrative Development: An Islamic Perspective|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=lT8OAAAAQAAJ|page=252}}|year=1985|publisher=KPI|isbn=978-0-7103-0059-1|pages=252–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ahmed |last1=Akgündüz|first2=Said |last2=Öztürk|title=Ottoman History: Misperceptions and Truths|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=EnT_zhqEe5cC|page=539}}|year=2011|publisher=IUR Press|isbn=978-90-90-26108-9|accessdate=7 October 2014|pages=539–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jihad===
{{Main|Jihad|Islamic military jurisprudence|List of expeditions of Muhammad}}

Jihad means "to strive or struggle" (in the way of God). Jihad, in its broadest sense, is "exerting one's utmost power, efforts, endeavors, or ability in contending with an object of [[wikt:disapprobation|disapprobation]]". Depending on the object being a visible enemy, the [[Devil]], and aspects of one's own self (such as sinful desires), different categories of jihad are defined.&lt;ref&gt;Firestone (1999) pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; Jihad also refers to one's striving to attain religious and moral perfection.&lt;ref&gt;

Certain religious rites are performed during and after the [[Islamic view of death|death of a Muslim]]. Those near a dying man encourage him to pronounce the [[Shahada]] as Muslims want their last word to be their profession of faith. After the death, the body is appropriately bathed by the members of the same gender and then enshrouded in a threefold white garment called ''kafan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Matt Stefon|title=Islamic Beliefs and Practices |publisher=[[Britannica Educational Publishing]] |year=2010 |location=New York City |isbn=978-1-61530-060-0|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placing the body on a [[bier]], it is first taken to a mosque where funeral prayer is offered for the dead person, and then to the graveyard for burial.

===Etiquette and diet===
{{Main|Adab (Islam)|Islamic dietary laws}}

Many practices fall in the category of ''adab'', or Islamic etiquette. This includes greeting others with "''[[As-Salamu Alaykum|as-salamu 'alaykum]]''" ("peace be unto you"), saying ''[[Basmala|bismillah]]'' ("in [[Names of God|the name of God]]") before meals, and using only the right hand for eating and drinking. [[Islamic hygienical jurisprudence|Islamic hygienic]] practices mainly fall into the category of personal cleanliness and health. [[Khitan (circumcision)|Circumcision of male offspring]] is also practiced in Islam. [[Islamic funeral|Islamic burial rituals]] include saying the ''[[Salat al-Janazah]]'' ("funeral prayer") over the bathed and enshrouded dead body, and burying it in a [[Grave (burial)|grave]]. Muslims are restricted in their diet. Prohibited foods include pork products, blood, [[carrion]], and [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. All meat must come from a [[herbivorous]] animal slaughtered in the name of God by a Muslim, Jew, or Christian, with the exception of game that one has hunted or fished for oneself. Food permissible for Muslims is known as [[halal]] food.&lt;ref&gt;

===Social responsibilities===
{{Main|Islam and humanity}}
In a Muslim society, various social service activities are performed by the members of the community. As these activities are instructed by [[Muslim scriptures|Islamic canonical texts]], a Muslim's religious life is seen incomplete if not attended by service to humanity.&lt;ref name=Stefon92&gt;{{cite book |editor=Matt Stefon|title=Islamic Beliefs and Practices |publisher=[[Britannica Educational Publishing]] |year=2010 |location=New York City |isbn=978-1-61530-060-0|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, In Islamic tradition, the idea of social welfare has been presented as one of its principal values.&lt;ref name=Stefon92/&gt; The {{cite quran|2|177|s=ns|b=n}} verse of the Quran is often cited to encapsulate the Islamic idea of social welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=John |last1= Corrigan |first2=Frederick |last2= Denny |first3=Martin S |last3= Jaffee |title=Jews, Christians, Muslims: A Comparative Introduction to Monotheistic Religions |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=VahYCwAAQBAJ|page=245}} |accessdate=22 January 2016 |year=2016 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=9781317347002 |page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The verse reads: 'It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces towards East or West; but it is righteousness to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and the Angels, and the Book and the Messengers; to spend of your substance, out of love for Him, for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask, and for the ransom of slaves; to be steadfast in prayer, and practice regular charity, to fulfill the contracts which we have made; and to be firm and patient, in pain (or suffering) and adversity, and throughout all periods of panic.

{{Main|Morality in Islam}}
[[File:Salat Eid al-Fitr, Tehran (113344343).jpg|thumb|210px|The [[Hijab]] represents [[Morality in Islam#Modesty and humility|modesty]]]]
The Quran and the [[sunnah]] of Muhammad prescribe a comprehensive body of moral guidelines for Muslims to be followed in their personal, social, political, and religious life. Proper moral conduct, good deeds, righteousness, and [[Moral character|good character]] come within the sphere of the moral guidelines.&lt;ref name=Campo-216&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Juan E.

To go one step further by offering a favor to the offender is regarded the highest excellence.&lt;ref name=Nigosian-116/&gt; The Quran says: 'Repel (evil) with what is best' ({{cite quran|41|34|s=ns|b=n}}). Thus, a Muslim is expected to act only in good manners as bad manners and deeds earn vices.&lt;ref name=Campo-215&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Juan E.

As a religion, Islam emphasizes the idea of having a good character as Muhammad said: 'The best among you are those who have the best manners and character' ({{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|8|73|56}}). In Islam, justice is not only a moral virtue but also an obligation to be fulfilled under all circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Khadduri |first= Majid |authorlink= |title= The Islamic Conception of Justice |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=td3XttHLGsEC|page=10}} |accessdate= |year=1984 |publisher= The Johns Hopkins University Press |location= |isbn=9780801869747 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran and the hadith describe God as being kind and merciful to His creatures, and tell people to be kind likewise.

&lt;/ref&gt; During the last 22 years of his life, beginning at age 40 in 610 [[Common Era|CE]], according to the earliest surviving biographies, Muhammad reported revelations that he believed to be from God, conveyed to him through the [[Holy Spirit (Islam)|archangel Gabriel]] (''Jibril''). Muhammad's [[Sahaba|companions]] memorized and recorded the content of these revelations, known as the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;

During this time, [[Muhammad in Mecca]] preached to the people, imploring them to abandon polytheism and to worship one God. Although some converted to Islam, the leading Meccan authorities persecuted Muhammad and his followers. This resulted in the [[Migration to Abyssinia]] of some Muslims (to the [[Aksumite Empire]]). Many early converts to Islam were the poor, foreigners and former slaves like [[Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi]] who was black. The Meccan élite felt that Muhammad was destabilising their social order by preaching about one God and about racial equality, and that in the process he gave ideas to the poor and to their slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ali |last=Ünal|title=The Qurʼan with Annotated Interpretation in Modern English|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=DyuqdDIjaswC|page=1323}}|year=2006|publisher=Tughra Books|isbn=978-1-59784-000-2|pages=1323–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]], Slaves and Slavery&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bilal b.

After 12 years of the [[persecution of Muslims by the Meccans]] and the [[Meccan boycott of the Hashemites]], Muhammad's relatives, Muhammad and the Muslims performed the ''[[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]]'' ("emigration") to the city of [[Medina]] (formerly known as ''Yathrib'') in 622. There, with the Medinan converts (''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]'') and the Meccan migrants (''[[Muhajirun]]''), [[Muhammad in Medina]] established his political and [[Theocracy|religious authority]]. The [[Constitution of Medina]] was formulated, instituting a number of rights and responsibilities for the Muslim, Jewish, Christian and pagan communities of Medina, bringing them within the fold of one community—the [[Ummah]].&lt;ref&gt;Serjeant (1978), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watt. ''Muhammad at Medina''. pp. 227–228 Watt argues that the initial agreement came about shortly after the hijra and that the document was amended at a later date – specifically after the battle of Badr (AH [anno hijra] 2, = AD 624). Serjeant argues that the constitution is in fact 8 different treaties which can be dated according to events as they transpired in Medina, with the first treaty written shortly after Muhammad's arrival. R. B. Serjeant.

Wellhausen argues that it belongs to the first year of Muhammad's residence in Medina, before the battle of Badr in 2/624. Even Moshe Gil a skeptic of Islamic history argues that it was written within five months of Muhammad's arrival in Medina. Moshe Gil. "The Constitution of Medina: A Reconsideration."

The Constitution established:

* the security of the community
* religious freedoms
* the role of Medina as a sacred place (barring all violence and weapons)
* the security of women
* stable tribal relations within Medina
* a tax system for supporting the community in time of conflict
* parameters for exogenous political alliances

All the tribes signed the agreement to defend Medina from all external threats and to live in harmony amongst themselves. Within a few years, two battles took place against the Meccan forces: first, the [[Battle of Badr]] in 624 – a Muslim victory, and then a year later, when the Meccans returned to Medina, the [[Battle of Uhud]], which ended inconclusively.

The Arab tribes in the rest of Arabia then formed a confederation and during the [[Battle of the Trench]] (March–April 627) besieged Medina, intent on finishing off Islam. In 628, the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]] was signed between Mecca and the Muslims and was broken by Mecca two years later. After the signing of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah many more people converted to Islam. At the same time, Meccan trade routes were cut off as Muhammad brought surrounding desert tribes under his control.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; By 629 Muhammad was victorious in the nearly bloodless [[conquest of Mecca]], and by the time of his death in 632 (at the age of 62) he had united the [[tribes of Arabia]] into a single religious [[polity]].&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"&gt;

The earliest three generations of Muslims are known as the [[Salaf]], with the companions of Muhammad being known as the [[Sahaba]]. Many of them, such as the largest narrator of hadith [[Abu Hureyrah]], recorded and compiled what would constitute the sunnah.

With Muhammad's death in 632, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. [[Abu Bakr]], a companion and close friend of Muhammad, was made the first [[caliph]]. Under Abu Bakr, Muslims put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the [[Ridda wars]], or "Wars of Apostasy".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran was compiled into a single volume at this time.

Abu Bakr's death in 634 resulted in the succession of [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] as the caliph, followed by [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]], [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] and [[Hasan ibn Ali]]. The first four caliphs are known in Sunni Islam as ''al-khulafā' ar-rāshidūn'' ("[[Rightly Guided Caliphs]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Rightly Guided Caliphs|editor=John L.

When Umar was assassinated by Persians in 644, [[the election of Uthman]] as successor was met with increasing opposition. The standard copies of the Quran were also distributed throughout the Islamic State. In 656, Uthman was also killed, and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|Ali]] assumed the position of caliph. This led to the [[First Fitna|first civil war]] (the "First Fitna") over who should be caliph. Ali was assassinated by [[Kharijites]] in 661. To avoid further fighting, the new caliph [[Hasan ibn Ali]] signed a [[Hasan–Muawiya treaty|peace treaty]], abdicating to [[Muawiyah I|Mu'awiyah]], beginning the [[Umayyad dynasty]], in return that he not name his own successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Holt|1977a|pp=67–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; These disputes over religious and political leadership would give rise to schism in the Muslim community. The majority accepted the legitimacy of the first four leaders and became known as Sunnis.

Al-Shafi'i codified a method to determine the reliability of hadith.&lt;ref&gt;Lapidus (2002){{cnf|date=November 2018}}, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; During the early Abbasid era, the major [[Six major Hadith collections|Sunni hadith collections]] were compiled by scholars such as [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Muslim]] while major [[The Four Books|Shia hadith collection]]s by scholars such as [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni|Al-Kulayni]] and [[Ibn Babawayh]] were also compiled. The [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]] was formed from the teachings of [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] while the four Sunni [[Madh'hab]]s, the [[Hanafi]], [[Hanbali]], [[Maliki]] and [[Shafi'i]], were established around the teachings of [[Abū Ḥanīfa]], [[Ahmad bin Hanbal]], [[Malik ibn Anas]] and [[al-Shafi'i]] respectively. In the 9th century, al-Shafi'i provided a theoretical basis for Islamic law by codifying the principles of jurisprudence in his book ''ar-Risālah''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Weiss|2002|pp=xvii,162}}{{cnf|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Tabari]] and [[Ibn Kathir]] completed the most commonly cited commentaries on the Quran, the [[Tafsir al-Tabari]] in the 9th century and the [[Tafsir ibn Kathir]] in the 14th century, respectively.

Caliphs such as [[Mamun al Rashid]] and [[Al-Mu'tasim]] made the [[mutazilite]] philosophy an official creed and imposed it upon Muslims to follow. Mu'tazila was a Greek influenced school of speculative theology called [[kalam]], which refers to [[dialectic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Esposito|2010|p=88}}{{cnf|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many orthodox Muslims rejected [[mutazilite]] doctrines and condemned their idea of the creation of the Quran. In inquisitions, Imam Hanbal refused to conform and was tortured and sent to an unlit [[Baghdad]] prison cell for nearly thirty months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Doi |first1= Abdur Rahman |title= Shariah: The Islamic Law |edition= |page=110|year=1984|publisher=Ta-Ha Publishers |location=London|isbn= 978-0-907461-38-8|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other branch of kalam was the [[Ash'ari]] school founded by [[Al-Ash'ari]].

Some Muslims began to question the piety of indulgence in a worldly life and emphasised poverty, humility and avoidance of [[Islamic views on sin|sin]] based on renunciation of bodily desires. Ascetics such as [[Hasan al-Basri]] would inspire a movement that would evolve into Tasawwuf (Sufism).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 13th century, Sufism underwent a transformation, largely because of efforts to legitimize and reorganize the movement by [[Al-Ghazali]], who developed the model of the [[Tariqa|Sufi order]]—a community of spiritual teachers and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Esposito|2004|pp=104,105}}{{cnf|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Muslims states independent of a unified Islamic state emerged from the Berber Revolt (739/740-743).

Two [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] tribes, the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate|Karahanids]] and the [[Seljuk]]s, converted to Islam during the 10th century, who are later subdued by the [[Ottoman]]s, who share the same origin and language. It is important to note, that the following Islamic reign by the Ottomans was strongly influenced by a [[symbiosis]] between [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rulers]] and [[Sufism]] since the beginning. According to Ottoman historiography, the legitimation of a ruler is attributed to [[Sheikh Edebali]]. Accordingly, he interpretated a dream of [[Osman I|Osman Gazi]] as God's legitimation of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;JENS PETER LAUT ''Vielfalt türkischer Religionen''  Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg (German) p.31&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mevlevi Order]] and the [[Bektashi Order]] had close relation to the sultans.&lt;ref&gt;Ga ́bor A ́goston, Bruce Alan Masters ''Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire'' Infobase Publishing 2010 {{ISBN|9781438110257}} p. 540&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turks incorporated elements of [[Tengrism|Turkish Shamanism]] into their new religion and became part of a new Islamic interpretation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceWorldWide"/&gt; One major change was the status of woman. Unlike Arabic traditions, the Turkic traditions were build on a matriarchal society.&lt;ref name="ReferenceWorldWide"/&gt; Turks preserved this status of woman even after conversion to Islam. Further, the Turks must have found striking similarities between the Sufi rituals and Shaman practises.&lt;ref name="ReferenceWorldWide"/&gt; However, the influence of Turkish belief was not limited to Sufism, but also to Muslims who subscribed an orthodox version of Islam in [[Anatolia]], [[Central-Asia]] and [[Balkan]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceWorldWide"&gt;Cenap Çakmak ''Islam: A Worldwide Encyclopedia [4 volumes]'' ABC-CLIO 2017 {{ISBN|9781610692175}} p. 1425-1429&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many (formerly) Shaman traditions were considered as genuine Islamic by average Muslims.&lt;ref name="ReferenceWorldWide"/&gt; Many shamanistic beliefs, such as the belief in sacred nature, spirits, trees and animals, even remained today.&lt;ref&gt;A.C.S.

The Muslim world was generally in political decline starting the 1800s, especially relative to the non-Muslim European powers. This decline was evident culturally; while [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]] founded an observatory in [[Istanbul]] and the Jai Singh Observatory was built in the 18th century, there was not a single Muslim-majority country with a major observatory by the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Imad-ad-Dean.

Building upon earlier efforts such as those by [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] and [[Ibn al-Qayyim]], the movement allegedly seeks to uphold monotheism and purify Islam of what they see as later [[bidah|innovations]]. Their zeal against [[Idolatry in Islam|idolatrous]] shrines led to the desecration of shrines around the world, including that of [[Destruction of early Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia|Muhammad and his companions in Mecca and Medina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Esposito|2010|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Graves desecrated in Mizdah|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/09/04/graves-desecrated-in-mizdah/#axzz2jWG0vDDO|newspaper=Libyan Herald|date=4 September 2013|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, the [[Deobandi]] and [[Barelwi]] movements were initiated.

Sunnis believe that the first four [[caliph]]s were the rightful successors to Muhammad; since God did not specify any particular leaders to succeed him and those leaders were elected. Sunnis believe that anyone who is righteous and just could be a caliph but they have to act according to the Quran and the Hadith, the example of Muhammad and give the people their rights.

The Sunnis follow the Quran and the Hadith, which are recorded in sunni traditions known as [[Al-Kutub Al-Sittah]] (six major books). For legal matters derived from the Quran or the Hadith, many follow four sunni [[madhhab|madh'habs]] (schools of thought): [[Hanafi]], [[Hanbali]], [[Maliki]] and [[Shafi'i]]. All four accept the validity of the others and a Muslim may choose any one that he or she finds agreeable.&lt;ref&gt;

While the Sunnis believe that a Caliph should be elected by the community, Shia's believe that Muhammad appointed his son-in-law, [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], as his successor and only certain descendants of Ali could be Imams. As a result, they believe that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] was the first ''Imam'' (leader), rejecting the legitimacy of the previous Muslim caliphs [[Abu Bakr]], [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]] and [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]]. Other points of contention include certain practices viewed as [[Bid‘ah|innovating]] the religion, such as the mourning practice of [[tatbir]], and the cursing of figures revered by Sunnis. However, [[Jafar al-Sadiq]] himself disapproved of people who disapproved of his great grand father [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Zayd ibn Ali]] revered Abu Bakr and [[Umar]].&lt;ref name="Tabarī, Carole Hillenbrand 1989, p37"&gt;''The waning of the Umayyad caliphate'' by Tabarī, Carole Hillenbrand, 1989, p37, p38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Religion Vol 1987, p243"&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Religion'' Vol.16, Mircea Eliade, Charles J.

Shia Islam has several branches, the most prominent being the [[Twelvers]] (the largest branch), [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidis]] and [[Ismaili]]s. Different branches accept different descendants of Ali as Imams. After the death of Imam [[Jafar al-Sadiq]] who is considered the sixth Imam by the [[Twelvers]] and the [[Ismaili]]'s, the Ismailis recognized his son Isma'il ibn Jafar as his successor whereas the Twelver Shia's (Ithna Asheri) followed his other son [[Musa al-Kadhim]] as the seventh Imam. The [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydis]] consider [[Zayd ibn Ali]], the uncle of Imam [[Jafar al-Sadiq]], as their fifth Imam, and follow a different line of succession after him. Other smaller groups include the [[Mustaali|Bohra]] as well as the [[Alawites]] and [[Alevi]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[Sufism]], or tasawwuf ({{lang-ar|تصوف}}), is a [[mystical]]-[[ascetic]] approach to Islam that seeks to find a direct [[Divine presence|personal experience of God]]. It is not a sect of Islam and its adherents belong to the various Muslim denominations. Classical Sufi scholars have focused on the reparation of the heart and turning it away from all else but God by making use of "intuitive and emotional faculties" that one must be trained to use.&lt;ref&gt;Trimingham (1998), p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Non-denominational Muslims===

===Derived religions===
Some movements, such as the [[Druze]], [[Berghouata]] and [[Ha-Mim]], either emerged from Islam or came to share certain beliefs with Islam and whether each is separate a religion or a sect of Islam is sometimes controversial. [[Yazdânism]] is seen as a blend of local Kurdish beliefs and Islamic Sufi doctrine introduced to [[Kurdistan]] by [[Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir]] in the 12th century. [[Bábism]] stems from Twelver Shia passed through [[Siyyid 'Ali Muhammad i-Shirazi al-Bab]] while one of his followers Mirza Husayn 'Ali Nuri [[Baha'u'llah]] founded the [[Bahai Faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=House of Justice|first1=Universal|title=One Common Faith|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/bic/OCF/ocf-8.html|website=reference.bahai.org|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sikhism]], founded by [[Guru Nanak]] in late-fifteenth-century [[Punjab]], incorporates aspects of both Islam and [[Hinduism]]. African American Muslim movements include the [[Nation of Islam]], [[Five-Percent Nation]] and [[Moorish scientists]].

According to the [[Pew Research Center]], Islam is set to equal Christianity worldwide in number of adherents by the year 2050. Islam is set to grow faster than any other major world religion, reaching a total number of 2.76&amp;nbsp;billion (an increase of 73%). Causes of this trend involve high [[Birth rate|fertility rates]] as a factor, with [[Muslims]] having a rate of 3.1 compared to the world average of 2.5, and the minimum replacement level for a population at 2.1. Another factor is also due to fact that Islam has the highest number of adherents under the age of 15 (34% of the total religion) of any major religion, compared with Christianity's 27%. 60% of Muslims are between the ages of 16 and 59, while only 7% are aged 60+ (the smallest percentage of any major religion). Countries such as [[Nigeria]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]] are expected to have Muslim majorities by 2050. In India, the Muslim population will be larger than any other country. Europe's non-Muslim population is set to decline as opposed to their Muslim population which is set to grow to 10% of Europe's total.&lt;ref name=pew2015/&gt; Growth rates of [[Islam in Europe]] was due primarily to immigration and higher birth rates of Muslims in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4385768.stm |title=site |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2005-12-23 |accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Islamic culture}}
The term "[[Islamic culture]]" could be used to mean aspects of culture that pertain to the religion, such as [[festivals]] and dress code. It is also controversially used to denote the cultural aspects of traditionally [[Muslim]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/05/arts/05iht-rartmelikian05.html|title='Islamic' Culture: A Groundless Myth|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=25 November 2013|date=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, "Islamic civilization" may also refer to the aspects of the synthesized culture of the early Caliphates, including that of non-Muslims,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Esposito|2010|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes referred to as "[[wikt:Islamicate|Islamicate]]".

===Architecture===
{{Main|Islamic architecture}}
Perhaps the most important expression of Islamic architecture is that of the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;"Islam", ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Varying cultures have an effect on mosque architecture. For example, North African and Spanish Islamic architecture such as the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]] contain [[marble]] and [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] columns from Roman and Byzantine buildings,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{Google books|LgnhYDozENgC|page=PA175|keywords=mosque%20kairouan%20roman columns|text=mosque+kairouan+roman+columns|plainurl=yes}} |title=Elizabeth Allo Isichei, ''A history of African societies to 1870'', page 175.

===Art===
{{Main|Islamic art}}
[[Islamic art]] encompasses the [[visual arts]] produced from the 7th century onwards by people (not necessarily [[Muslim]]) who lived within the territory that was inhabited by Muslim populations.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Jenkins-Madina, Richard Ettinghauset and Architecture 650–1250'', Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-08869-8}}, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; It includes fields as varied as architecture, [[calligraphy]], painting, and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]], among others.

While not condemned in the Quran, making images of human beings and animals is frowned on in many Islamic cultures and connected with [[Aniconism in Islam|laws against idolatry]] common to all Abrahamic religions, as 'Abdullaah ibn Mas'ood reported that Muhammad said, "Those who will be most severely punished by Allah on the Day of Resurrection will be the image-makers" (reported by al-Bukhaari, see al-Fath, 10/382). However this rule has been interpreted in different ways by different scholars and in different historical periods, and there are examples of paintings of both animals and humans in Mughal, Persian and Turkish art. The existence of this [[Aniconism in Islam|aversion to creating images of animate beings]] has been used to explain the prevalence of calligraphy, tessellation and pattern as key aspects of Islamic artistic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| publisher=Oxford University Press | title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Science, and Technology in Islam | author1=Salim Ayduz | author2= Ibrahim Kalin | author3=Caner Dagli| date=May 1, 2014 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=or-6BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA263&amp;lpg=PA263&amp;dq=islamic+art+idolatry+geometry#v=onepage&amp;q=islamic%20art%20idolatry%20geometry | quote=Figural representation is virtually unused in Islamic art because of Islam's strong antagonism of idolatry.

It is a [[lunar calendar]] with days lasting from sunset to sunset.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patheos Library]] – Islam Sacred Time – [http://www.patheos.com/Library/Islam/Ritual-Worship-Devotion-Symbolism/Sacred-Time.html Patheos.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic [[Muslim holidays|holy days]] fall on fixed dates of the lunar calendar, which means that they occur in [[seasons|different seasons]] in different years in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. The most important Islamic festivals are ''[[Eid al-Fitr]]'' ({{lang-ar|عيد الفطر}}) on the 1st of ''[[Shawwal]]'', marking the end of the fasting month ''Ramadan'', and ''[[Eid al-Adha]]'' ({{lang|ar|عيد الأضحى}}) on the 10th of ''[[Dhu al-Hijjah]]'', coinciding with the end of the Hajj pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;Ghamidi (2001): [http://www.renaissance.com.pk/janisla2y2.html Customs and Behavioral Laws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923142412/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/janisla2y2.html |date=2013-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{main|Criticism of Islam}}
[[File:Dante and Virgil Meet Muhammad and His Son-in-law, Ali in Hell.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Blake]]'s illustration of ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' (19th century) shows Muhammad pulling his chest open which has been sliced by a [[Devil in Christianity|devil]] to symbolize his role as a "[[False prophet#Christianity|false prophet]]".]]
Criticism of Islam has existed since Islam's formative stages. Early criticism came from Christian authors, many of whom viewed Islam as a Christian [[heresy]] or a form of idolatry and often explained it in apocalyptic terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Erwin Fahlbusch | title=The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 2 | publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing | year=1999 |  url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=yaecVMhMWaEC|page=759}}|page=759| isbn=9789004116955 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later there appeared criticism from the [[Muslim world]] itself, and also from [[Jewish]] writers and from ecclesiastical Christians.&lt;ref name="WarraqPoetry"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Warraq| first=Ibn | title=Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out | publisher=Prometheus Books | year=2003 | isbn=978-1-59102-068-4 | page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ibn Kammuna"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ibn|last=Kammuna|title=Examination of the Three Faiths|publisher=Moshe Perlmann|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|date=1971|pages=148–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oussani"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10424a.htm|title=Mohammed and Mohammedanism|first=Gabriel|last=Oussani|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia|website=Newadvent.org|accessdate=April 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objects of criticism include the morality of the life of Muhammad, the last law bearing prophet of Islam, both in his public and personal life,&lt;ref name="Oussani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WarraqQuest"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ibn|last=Warraq|title=The Quest for Historical Muhammad|location=Amherst, Mass.|publisher=Prometheus Books|date=March 1, 2000|edition=1st|isbn=978-1-57392-787-1|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in [[medieval Christian views on Muhammad]]. Issues relating to the authenticity and morality of the Quran, the Islamic holy book, are also discussed by critics.&lt;ref name="BibleInQuran"&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1032&amp;letter=B#3068 Bible in Mohammedian Literature.], by Kaufmann Kohler Duncan B.

Other criticisms focus on the question of human rights in modern Muslim-majority countries, and the treatment of women in Islamic law and practice.&lt;ref name="women"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&amp;year=2005&amp;country=6825|title=Saudi Arabia – Country report – Freedom in the World – 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IslamInEurope"&gt;{{Cite news| publisher=[[The New York Review of Books]] | date=2006-10-05 | title=Islam in Europe | author=Timothy Garton Ash | url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19371}}&lt;/ref&gt; In wake of the recent [[multiculturalism]] trend, Islam's influence on the ability of Muslim immigrants in the West to assimilate has been [[criticism of multiculturalism|criticized]].&lt;ref name="Modood"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Multiculturalism, Muslims and Citizenship: A European Approach | first=Tariq | last=Modood | publisher=Routledge | edition=1st | date=April 6, 2006 | isbn=978-0-415-35515-5 | page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French [[Protestant Reformation|Reformer]] [[John Calvin]] (1509–1564) was a theological writer who produced many sermons, biblical commentaries, letters, theological treatises, and other works. Although nearly all of Calvin's adult life was spent in [[Geneva]] (1536–38 and 1541–64), his publications spread his ideas of a properly reformed church to many parts of Europe and from there to the rest of the world. It is especially on account of his voluminous publications that he exerts such a lasting influence over Christianity and Western history.

Calvin's first published work was an [[edition (book)|edition]] of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s ''De Clementia'', accompanied by a commentary demonstrating a thorough knowledge of antiquity. His first theological work, the ''Psychopannychia'', attempted to refute the doctrine of [[soul sleep]] as promulgated by Christians whom Calvin called "[[Anabaptists]]." He finished it in 1534 but, on the advice of friends, didn't publish it until 1542. The work demonstrates that since his conversion, Calvin had undertaken serious study and now showed a mastery of the [[Bible]], and he had become, using [[Karl Barth]]'s words, a "theological Humanist" and a "biblicist" &amp;mdash; that is, "no matter how true a teaching might be, he was not ready to lend an ear to it apart from the Word of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Karl |last=Barth|author-link=Karl Barth |trans-title=The Theology of John Calvin |title=Die Theologie Calvins|language=German|origyear=1922|others=Translated by Geoffrey W. Bromiley| publisher = W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co | location = Grand Rapids | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0-8028-0696-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of twenty-six, Calvin published the first edition of his ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'' (Latin title: ''Institutio Christianae Religionis''), a seminal work in Christian theology that is still read by theological students today.&lt;ref name="131Christians"&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/special/131christians/calvin.html "John Calvin"] from "131 Christians everyone should know" in ''Christian History &amp; Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in Latin in 1536 and in his native French in 1541, with the definitive editions appearing in 1559 (Latin) and in 1560 (French). The book was written as an introductory textbook on the Protestant faith for those with some learning already and covered a broad range of theological topics from the doctrines of [[Christian Church|church]] and [[sacraments]] to [[sola fide|justification by faith alone]] and [[Christian liberty]], and it vigorously attacked the teachings of those Calvin considered [[orthodoxy|unorthodox]], particularly [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] to which Calvin says he had been "strongly devoted" before his conversion to Protestantism. The overarching theme of the book &amp;ndash; and Calvin's greatest theological legacy &amp;ndash; is the idea of God's total sovereignty, particularly in [[salvation]] and election.&lt;ref name="131Christians"/&gt;

Calvin also produced many volumes of commentary on most of the books of the Bible. For the [[Old Testament]], he published commentaries for all books except the histories after [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] (though he did publish his [[sermons]] on [[Books of Samuel|First Samuel]]) and the Wisdom literature other than the [[Book of Psalms]]. For the [[New Testament]], he omitted only the brief [[Second Epistle of John|second]] and [[Third Epistle of John|third]] [[Epistles of John]] and the [[Book of Revelation]]. These commentaries, too, have proved to be of lasting value to students of the Bible, and they are still in print after over 400 years.

Calvin also wrote more than 1,300 letters on a wide range of topics.

[[File:Tholuck.JPG|thumb|right|The title page from the 1834 edition of John Calvin's ''Institutio Christiane Religionis'']]
Calvin developed his theology, the most enduring component of his thought, in his biblical commentaries as well as his sermons and treatises, and he gave the most concise expression of his views on Christian theology in his ''magnum opus'', the ''Institutes of the Christian Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;See:

The second edition, published in 1539, was three times as long because he added chapters on subjects that appear in Melanchthon's ''[[Loci Communes]]''. In 1543, he again added new material and expanded a chapter on the [[Apostles' Creed]]. The final edition of the ''Institutes'' appeared in 1559. By then, the work consisted of four books of eighty chapters, and each book was named after statements from the creed: Book 1 on God the Creator, Book 2 on the Redeemer in Christ, Book 3 on receiving the Grace of Christ through the Holy Spirit, and Book 4 on the Society of Christ or the Church.&lt;ref&gt;See:

==Commentaries==
Calvin produced commentaries on most of the books of the Bible. His first commentary on [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] was published in 1540, and he planned to write commentaries on the entire [[New Testament]]. However, it took six years before he wrote his second, a commentary on [[I Corinthians]]. He did not lose any more time in reaching his goal. Within four years he had published commentaries on all the [[Pauline epistles]], and he also revised the commentary on Romans. He then turned his attention on the [[general epistles]], dedicating them to [[Edward VI of England]]. By 1555 he had completed his work on the New Testament, finishing with the [[Acts]] and the [[Gospels]] (he did omit only the brief [[Second Epistle of John|second]] and [[Third Epistle of John|third]] [[Epistles of John]]  and the [[Book of Revelation]]).

For the [[Old Testament]], he wrote commentaries on [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], the books of the [[Pentateuch]], the [[Psalms]], and [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]]. The material for the commentaries often originated from lectures to students and ministers that he would re-work for publication. However, from 1557 onwards, he could not find the time to continue this method, and he gave permission for his lectures to be published from stenographers' notes. These ''Praelectiones'' covered the [[minor prophets]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], and part of [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]].&lt;ref&gt;See:
*De Greef (2004), pp. 44–45.
*Parker (2006), pp. 134–136, 160–162.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the controversial matter of interpreting [[prophecy]] such as that in the Book of Daniel, Calvin proposed a [[preterism|preterist]] view, which is to say that he believed that the prophecies in the book of Daniel apply only to the history between prophet Daniel (530 BC) and Jesus' first coming (30 AD). In this view he was out of line with the [[early church]] and the Reformers who came before him, who maintained more fully to historical-continuous view. Calvin is also in distinction to many of his later successors who look a [[Futurism (Christian eschatology)|future fulfillment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=John Calvin |title=Commentary on Daniel, Volume 1 |chapter=Translator's Preface: The Praeterist, Anti-Papal, and Futurist Views |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom24.ii.html#ii-p90 |others=Thomas Meyers (trans.) |year=1852 |origyear=1561 |accessdate=2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Netherlands|Dutch]] theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]], after whom the anti-Calvinistic movement [[Arminianism]] was named, says with regard to the value of Calvin's writings:&lt;ref name="Tributes"&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc8.iv.viii.iv.html |chapter=Tributes to the Memory of Calvin |author=Philip Schaff |title=History of the Christian Church |volume=VIII |year=1892 |accessdate=2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Next to the study of the Scriptures which I earnestly inculcate, I exhort my pupils to peruse Calvin’s Commentaries, which I extol in loftier terms than Helmich himself (a Dutch divine, 1551&amp;ndash;1608); for I affirm that he excels beyond comparison in the interpretation of Scripture, and that his commentaries ought to be more highly valued than all that is handed down to us by the library of the [[Church father|fathers]]; so that I acknowledge him to have possessed above most others, or rather above all other men, what may be called an eminent spirit of [[prophecy]]. His ''Institutes'' ought to be studied after the [[Catechism#Heidelberg Catechism|(Heidelberg) Catechism]], as containing a fuller explanation, but with discrimination, like the writings of all men.

These commentaries, too, have proved to be of lasting value to students of the Bible, and they are still in print after over 400 years.

==Letters==
[[File:John Calvin's handwriting 01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Letter of Calvin to king [[Edward VI of England]], July 4, 1552 - [[British Museum]]]]
Calvin's body of letters has not received the wide readership of the ''Institutes'' and bible commentaries since his correspondence obviously addressed the particular needs and occasions of his day. Even so, the scale of his letter writing was just as prodigious as his better-known works: his letters number some 1,300, and, along with some 3,000 letters written to him, fill eleven of Calvin's fifty-nine volumes in the ''[[Corpus Reformatorum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;*{{Citation | last = De Greef | first = Wulfert | title =The Writings of John Calvin: An Introductory Guide | publisher =Westminster John Knox Press | year =2008 | place = Louisville, Kentucky| isbn = 0-664-23230-2 |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[B. B. Warfield]] calls Calvin "the great letter-writer of the Reformation age."&lt;ref&gt;B.B. Warfield, ''Calvin and Augustine''. The Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company, Philadelphia, PA, 1956. p. 14. Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 56-7349.&lt;/ref&gt;

His letters, often written under the [[pseudonym]] Charles d'Espeville,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc8.iv.xvi.html |title=History of the Christian Church |year=1892 |volume=VIII |chapter=Servetus: His Life, Opinions, Trial, and Execution |author=Philip Schaff |accessdate=2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; concern issues ranging from disputes about local theater&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.leedstrinity.ac.uk/histcourse/reformat/geneva/theagene.htm "06.56 Theatre in Geneva"]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to raising support for fledgling churches&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.leedstrinity.ac.uk/histcourse/reformat/geneva/calvlet1.htm "06.42 Calvin to Guillaume Farel, 30 December 1553"]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to choosing sides in a political alliance.&lt;ref name="Letters"&gt;Jules Bonnet, ''Letters of John Calvin''. Translated by David Constable, 4 volumes. Thomas Constable and Co., Edinburgh, U.K. vol. II, p. 212; vol. I, p. 436n; vol. I, pp. 434-435.&lt;/ref&gt; They also reveal personal qualities that are not evident in his exegetical prose. One example came after the massacre of the [[Waldensians]] of [[Provence]] in 1545 where 3,600 were slaughtered. Calvin was so dismayed that in a space of twenty-one days he visited Berne, Aurich, Schaffhausen, Basle, and Strasbourg, before addressing the deputies of the Cantons at the Diet of Arau, pleading everywhere for an intercession on behalf of those who survived.&lt;ref name="Letters"/&gt; He wrote of his grief to [[William Farel]]:

:Such was the savage cruelty of the persecutors, that neither young girls, nor pregnant women, nor infants were spared. So great is the atrocious cruelty of this proceeding, that I grow bewildered when I reflect upon it. How, then, shall I express it in words? &amp;nbsp;... I write, worn out with sadness, and not without tears, which so burst forth, that every now and then they interrupt my words.&lt;ref name="Letters"/&gt;

One of Calvin's better known letters was his reply to [[Jacopo Sadoleto]]'s "Letter to the Genevans,"&lt;ref&gt;Both letters can be found in [https://books.google.com/books?vid=00aHMHYuRrGTfBEk&amp;id=6iMBAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=%22tracts+relating+to+the+reformation%22#PPP6,M1 ''Calvin's Tracts Relating to the Reformation''] (pp. 3-24, 25-71), translated by H. Beveridge, 1844. Digitized by [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; and this "Reformation Debate" remains in print today.

B. Eerdmans Publishing Company|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=0-8028-6348-5|pages=493–494}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that it was written in French, it was less accessible to the scholastic readers of the time that read Latin. [[Martin Luther]] found a copy of the book in Latin in a bookstore later in his life and commented that he could have "entrusted the whole controversy" of the Last Supper to Calvin from the beginning.&lt;ref name="Thompson1996" /&gt;

"instrument".&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include a [[wikt:certificate|certificate]], [[deed]], [[Bond (finance)|bond]], [[contract]], [[will (law)|will]], [[legislative act]], [[Act (document)|notarial act]], court [[writ]] or process, or any [[law]] passed by a competent [[legislative body]] in [[municipal]] (domestic) or [[international law]]. Many legal instruments were written [[Seal_(contract_law)|''under seal'']] by affixing a wax or paper [[seal (device)|seal]] to the document in evidence of its legal execution and [[Authentication|authenticity]] (which often removed the need for [[consideration]] in [[contract]] law). However, today many jurisdictions have done away with the requirement of documents being under seal in order to give them legal effect.

==Electronic legal documents==
{{globalize/US|date=December 2010}}
With the onset of the Internet and electronic equipment such as the personal computers and cell-phones, legal instruments or formal legal documents have undergone a progressive change of [[dematerialization (economics)|dematerialisation]]. In this electronic age, document [[authentication]] can now be verified digitally using various software. All documents needing authentication can be processed as digital documents with all the necessary information such as date and time stamp imbedded. To prevent tampering or unauthorized changes to the original document, [[encryption]] is used. In modern times, authentication is no longer limited to the type of paper used, the specialized seal, stamps, etc., as document authentication software helps secure the original context. The use of electronic legal documents is most prominent in the United States' courts. Most United States' courts prefer the filing of electronic legal documents over paper. However, there is not yet a public law to unify the different standards of document authentication. Therefore, one must know the court's requirement before filing court papers. 

To address part of this concern, the United States Congress enacted the [[Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act]] in 2000 (P.L. 106-229 of 2000, 15 USCS sec. 7001) specifying that no court could thereafter fail to recognize a contract simply because it was digitally signed. The law is very permissive, making essentially any electronic character in a contract sufficient. It is also quite restrictive in that it does not force the recognition of some document types in electronic form, no matter what the electronic character might be. No restriction is made to signatures which are adequately cryptographically tied to both the document text (see [[message digest]]) and to a particular [[Cryptographic key|key]] whose use should be restricted to certain persons (e.g., the alleged sender). There is thus a gap between what the cryptographic engineering can provide and what the law assumes is both possible and meaningful.  

Several states had already enacted laws on the subject of electronic legal documents and signatures before the U.S. Congress had acted, including Utah, Washington, and California to name only a few of the earliest. They vary considerably in intent, coverage, cryptographic understanding, and effect. 

Several other nations and international bodies have also enacted statutes and regulations regarding the validity and binding nature of [[digital signature]]s. 
and with the signatures at the bottom.

To date, the variety (and inadequacy) of the definitions used for digital signatures (or electronic signatures) have produced a legal and contractual minefield for those who may be considering relying on the legality and enforceability of digitally signed contracts in any of many jurisdictions. Adequate legislation adequately informed by [[cryptographic engineering]] technology remains an elusive goal. That it has been fully, or adequately, achieved (in any jurisdiction) is a claim which must be taken with considerable caution.

'''''Let's Go''''' is a [[travel guide]] series researched, written, edited, and run entirely by students at [[Harvard University]]. The first of the budget/[[Backpacking (travel)|backpacker]]-oriented travel guides,&lt;ref&gt;"History of Let's Go," by Harvard Student Agencies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Let's Go'' promotes itself as "the student travel guide" but is aimed at readers "both young and young at heart".&lt;ref name="About Let's Go"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letsgo.com/about-us |title=About Let's Go |accessdate=2009-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Let's Go'' was founded in 1960 and is headquartered in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]].

==History==

===Founding===
The first Let's Go guide was a 25-page [[mimeograph]]ed pamphlet put together by an 18-year-old [[Harvard University|Harvard]] freshman named [[G. Oliver Koppell|Oliver Koppell]] and handed out on student charter flights to [[Europe]]; the first professionally published guide was issued in 1961. Early guides tended to be freewheeling—for example, advising travelers on motorbiking through [[Southeast Asia]] in the late 1960s and financing travel in Europe by [[Busking|singing in the street]]. The first edition described how to travel from Europe to [[Asia]] on just four cents: by taking the ferry across the [[Bosphorus]], from the European to the Asian side of the city of [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;"History of Let's Go," by Harvard Student Agencies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the guide became more popular throughout the 1960s, increasing quantities were printed every year. Let's Go also commissioned an artist, [[Richard Copaken]], to give the series a logo: its trademark [[Hot air balloon|hot-air balloon]]. (That other Let's Go logo, the [[hitchhiking|hitchhiker]] thumb, did not appear until 1973.) Maps and a "general introduction" section (the "Before You Go" of modern guidebooks) were added, and the venture went national. Sales skyrocketed after Let's Go Business Manager [[Andrew Tobias]] promoted the books on the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;"History of Let's Go," by Harvard Student Agencies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's success inspired it to produce spin-off titles in the late 1960s. One of Let's Go's most irreverent titles, ''Let's Go II: The Student Guide to Adventure'', covered "exotic" destinations such as "Red [[China]]" and wrote in its [[Vietnam]] chapter, "Just about no one ''wants'' to go to Vietnam these days. Most Americans who do travel there go with the army and leave as soon as they can." Additional one-offs for budget travelers included ''Let's Go: The Student Guide to [[United States|America]]'' and ''Let's Go: [[Caribbean]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"History of Let's Go," by Harvard Student Agencies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
In 1971, Let's Go became weary of self-publishing (i.e., "cutting and pasting on Oliver's living-room floor") and signed on with publisher [[E.P. Dutton]]. At this time, Let's Go's only title remained the original flagship ''Let's Go: Europe''. The book's popularity, however, caused its staff to consider additional titles. The first permanent new guide, ''Let's Go: [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]]'', was published in 1976. After excellent sales, ''Let's Go: [[France]]'' and ''Let's Go: [[Italy]]'' soon followed. All four were updated every year thereafter. Indeed, for much of its history, Let's Go was the only travel guide to update each of its titles every single year.&lt;ref&gt;"History of Let's Go," by Harvard Student Agencies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Let's Go continued expanding as it added further European titles as well as a new, permanent book on domestic travel. In 1982, Let's Go signed a contract with new publisher [[St. Martin's Press]] to publish its roster of six titles. By 1985, Let's Go was publishing 10 books a year, including ''Let's Go: [[Mexico]]'', the first new title not written from previously existing content. In 1986, 440,000 copies of Let's Go books were printed and sold in dozens of countries within three months of being researched—a new industry record.&lt;ref&gt;"History of Let's Go," by Harvard Student Agencies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s, Let's Go branched out into city-specific guidebooks, allowing expansion to continue at a rate of multiple new guidebooks per year. Around this time, Let's Go earned some of its most famous monikers, including "the granddaddy of budget guides" (the [[New York Times]]) and "the Bible of the budget traveler" (the [[Boston Globe]]).&lt;ref&gt;"History of Let's Go," by Harvard Student Agencies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; At 15 titles in 1992, the student-run company emphasizing travel on a budget had become one of the largest travel guides in the world.&lt;ref&gt;"History of Let's Go," by Harvard Student Agencies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital era===
In 1996, Let's Go launched its website, [http://www.letsgo.com Letsgo.com], while publishing 22 titles and a new line of mini map guides. By this time, Let's Go had branched out beyond just Europe (its traditional turf) and [[North America]] to [[Africa]] and Asia, as well. The company's first [[South America]]n guide, ''Let's Go: [[Ecuador]] and the [[Galápagos Islands|Galapagos]]'', came in 1997 as the 24th title. ''Let's Go: [[Australia]]'' and ''Let's Go: [[New Zealand]]'' followed the next year, putting Let's Go on every continent but [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;"History of Let's Go," by Harvard Student Agencies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Into the 2000s, the physical books evolved as well, with updated covers, new editorial features like a "Price Diversity" scale, and photos in the guides for the first time. The company was still expanding at a breakneck speed, from 30 titles in 2000 to 33 in 2001, 37 in 2002, 41 in 2003, 45 in 2004, and 48 in 2005. At this point, Let's Go employed over 200 students every year.&lt;ref&gt;"History of Let's Go," by Harvard Student Agencies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Let's Go also expanded its web presence dramatically in this decade. The company profited from strong online advertising and partnerships and gradually populated its website with [[blog]]s, [[podcast]]s, and videos. In 2008, a redesigned website was unveiled that made Let's Go the first travel guide to offer all of its book content online free of charge. Let's Go has also brought its content to [[smartphone]]s and [[Tablet computer|tablets]] as well: since 2011, its guidebooks have also been available for download as [[e-book]]s, and the company has released dozens of free, destination-specific [[mobile apps]], with more in the works.&lt;ref&gt;"History of Let's Go," by Harvard Student Agencies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The Let's Go Travel Guides App has been rated as "a must have brilliant app".&lt;ref name="Student Travel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://studenttravel.auswidecolleges.edu.au/student-travel-checklist/ |title=Student Travel, Student travel checklist |accessdate=2013-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130627220716/http://studenttravel.auswidecolleges.edu.au/student-travel-checklist/ |archivedate=2013-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let's Go also announced a new print publisher, [[Publishers Group West|Avalon Travel]],&lt;ref name="Avalon Travel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.letsgo.com/article/290-let%E2%80%99s-go-announces-innovative-publishing-and-distribution-partnership-with-avalon-travel-and-publishers-group-west |title=Let’s Go Announces Innovative Publishing and Distribution Partnership with Avalon Travel and Publishers Group West |accessdate=2009-06-29 |last=Gordon |first=Laura |date=2009-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630204153/http://www.letsgo.com/article/290-let%E2%80%99s-go-announces-innovative-publishing-and-distribution-partnership-with-avalon-travel-and-publishers-group-west |archivedate=2009-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; upon the expiration of its contract with St. Martin's Press in 2009.&lt;ref name="Harvard Crimson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=519642 |title=Publisher, Guide Agree To Let Go |accessdate=2009-06-29 |last=Marks |first=Clifford M. |date=2007-09-24 |work=The Harvard Crimson }}&lt;/ref&gt; The switch led to a new format for the insides of the books, new retro covers for the outsides, and a rebranding to emphasize Let's Go's student origins. The theme has been changed in 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2009. In 2014, Let's Go began self-publishing for the first time since 1970.&lt;ref&gt;"History of Let's Go," by Harvard Student Agencies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
As a subsidiary of [[Harvard Student Agencies]], Let's Go's charter states that the company may only employ degree-seeking Harvard students; because of this, Let's Go's business model is unique among publishers. Every year, a student management team is chosen from the previous year's staff. This core group works out of Let's Go's Cambridge offices all year round on the company's website, publicity, and editorial matters. Over the winter, the management team hires a staff of Editors, who in turn hire the company's traveling [[Travel writing|Researcher-Writers]]. Editors work part-time throughout the spring semester to prepare and train Researcher-Writers for their trips. After the semester ends, the Researcher-Writers leave Cambridge for their destination, while the Editors begin working full-time at the Cambridge office. Researcher-Writers, traveling alone, typically spend from six to eight weeks of their summer (June–July) on the road, visiting the assigned establishments in their assigned cities and sending raw copy back to Cambridge. In order to keep the writing true to the budget heritage of the series, Researcher-Writers are paid a daily [[stipend]] intended to cover only basic expenses (although Let's Go does cover airfare to and from their destination). Meanwhile, Editors work throughout the entire summer, aiding the Researcher-Writers and editing the copy. The guides are assembled from the edited copy in August and September, and are released in [[bookstore]]s the following winter—just as the publishing process for the next year's guides has begun.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.letsgo.com/apply/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editorial style==
Let's Go has used many words to describe the style of its content. "Witty and irreverent" is possibly the most frequently used descriptor; the company takes pride in its youthful, casual, sometimes zany tone and trains its writers to avoid "[[brochure]]-ese". Let's Go also promotes the unvarnished opinions of its reviews, stating that they want the takeaway of every single listing, good or bad, to be clear to the reader. This honesty led to a [[Libel|lawsuit]] against Let's Go in 1990 as a result of a scathing review of an [[Israel]]i [[hostel]], but the travel guide was victorious in court, upheld by the judges as "the modern equivalents of [[Thomas Paine]] or [[John Peter Zenger]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1998/3/31/court-strikes-lets-go-lawsuit-pcalling/?print=1&lt;/ref&gt; Other traits the company has emphasized include its budget roots and social consciousness.

==Titles==
As of the 2017 series of guidebooks, Let's Go has published 75 titles covering six continents. The books range from country guides to adventure, city, budget, and road trip guides, many of which are still updated annually. Let's Go has also published 20 abridged, pocket-sized "map guides" ([[Amsterdam]], [[Berlin]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Dublin]], [[Florence]], [[Hong Kong]], [[London]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Madrid]], [[New Orleans]], [[New York City]], [[Paris]], [[Prague]], [[Rome]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]], [[Sydney]], [[Venice]], and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]]), though these have been discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.letsgo.com/shop&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball]] — Unlike the other entries in this list, Duke was highly successful on the court throughout the decade. The Blue Devils were "honored" because of their alleged tendency to [[Flop (basketball)|flop]] in order to draw offensive fouls.
# [[2004 United States men's Olympic basketball team|2004 USA men's basketball team]] — Amid a breakdown of team chemistry, Team USA lost more games in the [[Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympics]] (three) than it had in all previous Olympic tournaments combined (two).
# [[Barry Zito]] — After considerable success with the [[Oakland Athletics]], the left-handed pitcher crossed [[San Francisco Bay]] after the [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006 season]] to play for the [[San Francisco Giants]], signing what was then the richest contract for a pitcher in baseball history. He proceeded to go 31–43 in the next three seasons, never posting an ERA below 4.00.

# [[Steve Spurrier]] with the [[Washington Redskins]] — A successful coach in the NCAA, Spurrier was 12-20 in his 2 years with the Redskins, and did not make the playoffs in those years.
# [[Ron Zook]], first at [[Florida Gators football|Florida]] and then at [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]] — Zook coached Florida for 3 seasons, with a record of 23–14, and did not beat a ranked opponent at home in those years. He was then hired by Illinois and compiled a record of 34–51 in his 7 seasons there.
# [[Matt Millen]] — In Millen's seven-plus seasons as the general manager of the [[Detroit Lions]], the team went 31–84. He was fired three games into the [[2008 Detroit Lions season|2008 season]], which would end with the Lions becoming the first NFL team ever to go 0–16.

Most '''countries of the world''' have '''different names''' in different languages. Some countries have also undergone name changes for political or other reasons. This article attempts to give all known alternative names for all nations, countries and sovereign states. It does not offer any opinion about what the "original", "real", or "correct" name of any country is or was.

Countries are listed alphabetically by their '''current best-known name in English'''. Each English name is followed by its currently best-known equivalents in other languages, listed in English alphabetical order (ignoring accents) by name and by language. Historical and/or alternative versions, where included, are noted as such. Foreign names that are the same as their English equivalents are listed, to provide an answer to the question "What is that name in..."?. See also: [[List of alternative country names]]

Entries are formatted as follows: languages written in the Latin alphabet use "'''Name''' (language)" [for example, "'''Afeganistão''' (Portuguese)"] and are alphabetized in the list according to English rules of alphabetical order. Languages written in other [[writing system]]s use "'''Romanization''' - native script (language)" [for example, "'''English''' - אַרגענטינע (Yiddish)"] and are alphabetized in the list by the romanized form.

For reasons of size, this article is broken into four parts:
*[[List of country names in various languages (A–C)]]
*'''List of country names in various languages (D–I)'''
*[[List of country names in various languages (J–P)]]
*[[List of country names in various languages (Q–Z)]]

The '''Magazine of Western History''', in its last three years '''The National Magazine''', was published from 1884 to 1894. According to the ''Encyclopedia of Cleveland History'', among Cleveland publications it was "the only journal possibly ranked by literary and artistic excellence, although only a small portion was devoted to poetry and fiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://case.edu/ech/articles/l/literature|chapter=Literature|title=Encyclopedia of Cleveland History|publisher=[[Case Western Reserve University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the magazine's name suggests, most of its contents were devoted to history.

==History==
The Magazine of Western History was founded 1884 in Cleveland by William W. Williams, who was its editor, and L. A. Williams.&lt;ref name=history-of-cleveland&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the City of Cleveland|author=Walter Scott Robison|publisher=Jazzybee Verlag|year=1887|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogk7DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144|pages=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888 the publication moved to [[New York City]] to be published by the Magazine of Western History Co.

In November 1891, at the start of volume 14, the focus on the West was dropped and the magazine was renamed ''The National Magazine''. The name of the publisher changed to The National History Company. Publication ceased after the 17th and last volume in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=8911|title=Periodical or newspaper: Magazine of western history|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000055404|website=[[HathiTrust]]|title=The National magazine|location=[[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''More Irish than the Irish themselves'''" ({{lang-ga|Níos Gaelaí ná na Gaeil féin}}, {{lang-la|Hiberniores Hibernis ipsis}}) is a phrase used in [[Irish historiography]] to describe a phenomenon of [[cultural assimilation]] in late medieval [[Norman Ireland]].

==History==
The descendants of [[Hiberno-Norman]] lords who had settled in Ireland in the 12th century had been significantly [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]
by the end of the Middle Ages, forming [[Sept|septs]] and clans after the indigenous Gaelic pattern, and became known as the Gall or "[[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]]" (contrasting with the "New English" arriving with the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]]).&lt;ref name=MacLysaght &gt;{{cite book | first=Edward | last=MacLysaght | title=More Irish Families | publisher=Irish Academic Press | ISBN=0-7165-0126-0 | quote=Some became completely integrated, giving rise to the well known phrase 'Hiberniores Hibernis ipsis' (more Irish than the Irish themselves). These formed septs on the Gaelic-Irish pattern, headed by a chief. The Gall &amp; Gael became virtually indistinguishable. | url=http://www.heraldry.ws/info/article06.html | accessdate=20 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="palmer"&gt;{{cite book | title=Language and Conquest in Early Modern Ireland: English Renaissance Literature and Elizabethan Imperial Expansion | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Palmer, Patricia | year=2001 | location=Cambridge | page=41 | isbn=9781139430371}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Statutes of Kilkenny]], 1366, complained that
" ... now many English of the said land, forsaking the English language, manners, mode of riding, laws and usages, live and govern themselves according to the manners, fashion, and language of the Irish enemies".&lt;ref&gt;The introduction to the text of the Statutes of Kilkenny, 1366, (pp.4–7)&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase (in Latin) was used by the Irish priest and historian [[John Lynch (Gratianus Lucius)|John Lynce]] (c1599–1677) in his work ''Cambrensis Eversus''.&lt;ref&gt;Seán O'Faoláin, The Irish (Penguin 1947), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Irelands in the Asia-Pacific | publisher=Colin Smythe | author=Kuch, Peter | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was strongly influenced by the writings of the historian [[Geoffrey Keating]] (1569 – c. 1644), whose ''History of Ireland'' he translated into Latin.&lt;ref name="jane"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ireland from Independence to Occupation 1641–1660 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Ohlmeyer, Jane | year=2002 | location=Cambridge | page=122 | isbn= 9780521522755}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cambrensis Eversus'' was translated from the Latin, with notes and observations, by Theophilus O'Flanagan, Dublin, 1795.

==Eighteenth-century use==
John Henry Wilson, in his ''Sketch of Jonathan Swift'' (1804), wrote that Swift used the phrase ("Hiberniores Hibernis ipsis") in a discussion with his landlord.&lt;ref name="swift"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=3esyAQAAMAAJ | title=Swiftiana Vol. 1 and 2 | publisher=R. Phillips | author=Wilson, John Henry | year=1804 | pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nineteenth-century use==
[[File:Buttevant Friary South Transept South Gable FitzGerald of Desmond Coat of Arms Detail 2012 09 08.jpg|300px|thumb|Relief of coat of arms of the FitzGerald of Desmond in [[Buttevant Franciscan Friary|Buttevant Friary]]. [[Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond]] (known in Irish as ''Gearóid Iarla'') was a prime example of the Gaelicisation of the Hiberno-Normans.]]
The phrase remained in use by romantic nineteenth-century nationalists to promote the common Irishness of 'Planter and Gael'. An example is found in the 1844 poem by the [[Young Irelander]], [[Thomas Davis (Young Irelander)|Thomas Davis]] called 'The Geraldines', which concerns the [[FitzGerald dynasty]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/E850004-008/index.html "The Geraldines"]. UCC&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|.......

These Geraldines! These Geraldines! -not long our air they breathed;
Not long they fed on venison, in Irish water seethed;
Not often had their children been by Irish mothers nursed;
when from their full and genial hearts an Irish feeling burst!
The English monarch strove in vain, by law, and force, and bribe,
To win from Irish thoughts and ways this 'more than Irish' tribe;
For still they clung to fosterage, to breitheamh, cloak and bard:
What king dare say to Geraldine, 'Your Irish wife discard'?
 
.....}}

==Modern use==
The phrase remains in common use, both colloquially and in the media, in reference to recent immigration and [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] in Ireland, and to some degree about some of the [[Irish diaspora]] (for example in ''[[The Irish Times]]'',&lt;ref name=IrishTimes&gt;{{cite web | first= | last= LookWest | title=More Irish Than the Irish Themselves?  |  url=http://www.lookwest.ie/index.php/more-irish-than-the-irish-themselves.php | accessdate=20 November 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060715081240/http://www.lookwest.ie/index.php/more-irish-than-the-irish-themselves.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 15 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jim Walsh (Irish politician)|Senator Jim Walsh]],&lt;ref name=ParliamentofIreland&gt;{{cite web| first=| last=| title=Dáil Éireann| url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0178/S.0178.200412010006.html| accessdate=20 November 2006| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427052043/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0178/S.0178.200412010006.html| archivedate=27 April 2006| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liam Twomey]],&lt;ref name=ParliamentofIreland2&gt;{{cite web | first= | last=  | title=Dáil Éireann | url=http://www.gov.ie/debates-03/27May/Sect5.htm | accessdate=20 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Irish Emigrant''&lt;ref name=IrishEmigrant&gt;{{cite web | first= Cormac | last= MacConnell | title=The Pull of the City of the Tribes | url=http://www.emigrant.ie/cityofthetribes.htm | accessdate=20 November 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004617/http://www.emigrant.ie/cityofthetribes.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or in conversation discussing the relationship between the cultural heritage of the Irish diaspora and the Irish in Ireland.&lt;ref name=Boards&gt;{{cite web | first=  | last=  | title=have you heard of this | url=http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=122991 | accessdate=20 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; While still echoing its original meaning, contemporary usage of the phrase usually takes a more open interpretation of assimilation or, in the case of the diaspora, the maintenance of Irish heritage.

Debates of the [[Oireachtas]] demonstrate the age and range of contemporary applications of the phrase. Either when discussing the diaspora:
{{quote|I do not think this country will afford sufficient allurements to the citizens of other States ... The children of Irish parents born abroad are sometimes more Irish than the Irish themselves, and they would come with added experience and knowledge to our country....&lt;ref name=FisheryBill&gt;{{cite web  | first=Patrick  | last=Kenny  | title=Seanad Éireann – Volume 2 – 15 January 1924  | url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0002/S.0002.192401150005.html  | accessdate=21 November 2006  | deadurl=yes  | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607065150/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0002/S.0002.192401150005.html  | archivedate=7 June 2011  | df=dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Or, more light-heartedly, on assimilation:
{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;[As] in olden times the attractiveness of Irish life made the Norman invaders ... 'Hiberniores Hibernicis ipsis', 'more Irish than the Irish themselves', so the charms of Galway, experienced through 25 happy years, have made a woman, born in one of the severed counties, feel entitled to describe herself as 'Galviensior Galviensibus ipsis' – 'more Galwegian than the Galwegians themselves'.&lt;ref name=PrivateBusiness&gt;{{cite web | first=Helena | last=Concannon | title=Dáil Éireann – Volume 68 – 9 June 1937 | url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0068/D.0068.193706090011.html | accessdate=21 November 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607065216/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0068/D.0068.193706090011.html | archivedate=7 June 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, S. J. Connolly has written, "The descendents of the English conquerors, it was confidently proclaimed, had become 'more Irish than the Irish themselves'.

Rev. '''Nehemiah Strong''' (24 February 1729 (N.S.) – 13 August 1807) was an American [[astronomer]] and [[meteorologist]] who was the first Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at [[Yale College]] from 1770&lt;ref&gt;The post was created in September 1770 for him (Franklin Bowditch Dexter, ''Biographical Sketches of the Graduates of Yale College with Annals'' 1896, ''s.v.'' "Strong, Nehemiah").&lt;/ref&gt; and produced a series of annual [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]], the astronomical element in  [[almanac]]s, which were printed in Hartford, Connecticut, and in New Haven.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Carlos Bates, [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44817296.pdf "Check List of Connecticut Almanacs, 1709–1850: With Introduction and Notes"] ''Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society'' '''24'''(1): 93-215. 1914.  [Especially pp 101 (brief biographical details) and following pages, giving text of some letters.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong was born in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], eldest of three children of Nehemiah and Hannah&lt;ref&gt;Hannah, the daughter of John and Sarah (Warner) French, had been the widow of Nathaniel Edwards (Dexter 1896).&lt;/ref&gt; Strong and the grandson of Samuel and Esther (Clapp) Strong, of [[Northampton, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Dexter 1896"&gt;Dexter 1896.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nehemiah Strong graduated from [[Yale College]] in 1755. He entered on a tutorship at Yale in November 1757 and was soon licensed to preach and was settled [[Congregationalist]] minister at Turkey Hill, now part of  [[East Granby, Connecticut]], 1761-67.

His marriage to Lydia Smith proved to be an embarrassment, when after she had been granted a divorce in February 1759 on grounds of abandonment, her husband, Andrew Burr Jr of New Haven, having gone to the West Indies in January 1755, Burr reappeared and her marriage to Nehemiah Strong was necessarily annulled, and as a result of entanglements he was dismissed from his pastorate at Turkey Hill, 23 June 1767.&lt;ref name="Dexter 1896"/&gt; He married Mrs Mary Thomas, the widow of Dr Lemuel Thomas of Newtown, 15 June 1778.

Thereafter he resided in Newtown, in New Milford, where he kept an academy for boys, and, from 1803 in Bridgeport, giving occasional sermons and teaching to the time of his death. He resigned his chair at Yale in 1781, in a dispute over his salary, exacerbated by the sense on the part of the Corporation that he was not a sufficiently ardent Patriot. He represented Newtown in the [[Connecticut General Assembly]], May 1784. His portrait by [[Ralph Earl]], painted in 1789-90, was presented to Yale by the artist&lt;ref name="Dexter 1896"/&gt; and remains in the University's collection.

His treatise on astronomy&lt;ref&gt;Three lectures given at Yale in 1781, published as ''Astronomy Improved; or, A new theory of the harmonious Regularity observable in the Mechanism or Movements of the Planetary System'' (New Haven, 1784, dedicated to Yale President [[Ezra Stiles]]).&lt;/ref&gt; won him such a wide reputation that anonymous almanacs were attributed to him. His first essay at compiling an almanac was anonymous, for ''Watson's Register'' for 1775, printed at Hartford; his second essay was ''The Connecticut Almanack'' for 1778, which identified his Yale title only.&lt;ref&gt;Bates p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1782 he published almanacs under his own name at Hartford and as "Hosea Stafford" in New Haven (1776–1804). In addition, finding that he was publicly assumed to be the "Isaac Bickerstaff",&lt;ref&gt;The character [[Isaac Bickerstaff]] had been invented as a pseudonym by [[Jonathan Swift]] as part of a hoax to predict the death of then famous almanac–maker, [[astrologer]], and quack [[John Partridge (astrologer)|John Partridge]].&lt;/ref&gt; having disclaimed authorship in a letter to the ''Connecticut Journal'', New Haven, 27 October 1784, he apparently decided to take up the slack and issue almanacs as "Bickerstaff" himself: they appeared at Hartford for several years after 1785.&lt;ref&gt;Strong's authorship was detected by close collations of printed almanacs by Alfred Carlos Bates 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter of 6 May 1803 to Elisha Babcock, Strong remarks that the calculations for the forthcoming year will be his last:
{{quote|I am pretty well Tired of the Business. For 29&amp;nbsp;years past I have Successively furnished one or more Copies for Printer; generally two, sometimes three in a year. And I think I have done my Part. Tis an Elaborate fatiguing Business, and requires the closest care and Attention to do the Business with proper accuracy, and takes a large Portion of my Time.}}

He recommended his pupil David Sanford of Newtown, Connecticut.

'''Nova Scotia Museum''' (NSM) is the corporate name for the 27 museums across [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]], and is part of the province's tourism infrastructure. The organization manages more than 200 historic buildings, living history sites, vessels, specialized museums and about one million artifacts and specimens, either directly or through a system of co-operative agreements with societies and local boards. The NSM delivers programs, exhibits and products which provide both local residents and tourists in Nova Scotian communities an opportunity to experience and learn about Nova Scotia's social and natural history.&lt;ref name="Billard2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Allan Billard|title=Lighthouses of Nova Scotia: Discovering their history and heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zquwDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23|date=3 October 2016|publisher=Formac Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-4595-0449-3|pages=23–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than 600,000 people visit the facilities each year. 

==History==
The NSM was created by the Nova Scotia Museum Act, a provincial legislation. 

The Nova Scotia Museum began with the collection of the Mechanics Institute in Halifax, founded in December 1831. The museum was formally established in 1868. The Rev. Dr. David Honeyman was the first curator. He was followed by [[Harry Piers]], who as curator from 1899 to 1940 oversaw a steady expansion of the museum's collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As well as managing and maintaining historical collections, the museum has sponsored the publication of many historical books, pamphlets and other documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://halifaxmag.com/cityscape/collaborators-launch-new-harmful-nova-scotia-plants-app/ "Collaborators launch new 'Harmful Nova Scotia Plants' app"]. ''Halifax Magazine'', Sara Sawyer, March 9, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The museum staff and volunteers undertake a variety of restoration projects,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.canadianwoodworking.com/get-more/ships "Model Building - Ships"]. ''Canadian Woodworking &amp; Home Improvement Magazine'', August/September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; create cultural and natural history displays,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thechronicleherald.ca/books/1531592-n.s.-history-comes-to-life-in-calendar "N.S. history comes to life in calendar"].

'''Paul Max Boesch'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/33861?c=search&amp;first=paul&amp;last=boesch Texas Deaths, 1964-1998]&lt;/ref&gt; (October 2, 1912{{spaced ndash}}March 7, 1989) was a [[professional wrestler]] and promoter, most famous for his work as an announcer and promoter for [[Houston Wrestling]]. He also spent several stints working with the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]], [[World Class Championship Wrestling]], Jim Crockett Promotions, and the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]].

==Early life and education==
Boesch was born in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]], on October 2, 1912.  His family eventually moved from Brooklyn to nearby [[Long Beach, New York|Long Beach]], where Boesch graduated from [[Long Beach High School (New York)|Long Beach High School]] in 1929.  A gifted athlete, he became a lifeguard at the [[Long Island]] beaches near his home, and he was skilled enough as a swimmer to place third in the North Atlantic Coast Lifeguard Competition in 1932. Boesch began wrestling professionally during the 1930s.  His first notable match was a 90-minute bout against Pat Meehan in [[Calgary]] on November 25, 1938 that ended in a draw.

==Military Service==
With the outbreak of [[World War II]], Boesch suspended his wrestling career to enlist in the [[United States Army]].  He graduated from [[officer candidate school]] in 1942 and earned a commission in the [[121st Infantry Regiment (United States)|121st Infantry Regiment]] of the [[8th Infantry Division (United States)|8th Infantry Division]].  Boesch deployed to Europe with his unit after the [[D-Day]] landings to take part in the offensive against [[Nazi Germany]].  As [[commanding officer]] of Company G, [[first lieutenant|1st Lt.]] Boesch led his [[company (military unit)|rifle company]] in one of the bloodiest and most desperate battles of the war on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], the [[Battle of Hürtgen Forest]].  His unit took heavy casualties during the fighting, and Boesch himself was seriously injured by a German artillery shell.  For his service, Boesch was awarded numerous decorations, including the [[Purple Heart]], the [[Silver Star|Silver Star with oak leaf clusters]], the [[Bronze Star|Bronze Star with oak leaf clusters]], and the [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945 (France)|French Croix de Guerre with star]]. He also earned the prized [[Combat Infantryman Badge]] and the [[Distinguished Unit Citation]], awarded to the soldiers of the 121st Infantry for their meritorious efforts in the Hürtgen Forest.  After the war, he was honored with a Distinguished Citizens Award from the 121st Infantry Association for his outstanding community service with charitable groups including the [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys Club of America]].  Boesch authored a well-regarded memoir of his experiences in World War II entitled, ''Road to Huertgen: Forest in Hell''.

==Houston Wrestling==

After World War II, Boesch returned to wrestling, competing in matches across North America. In 1947 he was injured in a car accident, forcing him to retire from competition. It was at this time that [[Houston Wrestling]] promoter Morris Sigel approached him to work for his growing Texas organization. Boesch became an advisor to Sigel as well as a radio announcer, and two years later became the promotion's first television commentator when the show debuted on local television. Boesch's wrestling broadcasts remained a fixture on Houston television for over 30 years, airing on station KHTV channel 39 (now [[KIAH]], a [[CW Network]] affiliate).

After Sigel died in 1966, Boesch bought out Houston Wrestling from Sigel's widow.  Boesch had essentially been training for this opportunity for 20 years, and he quickly brought the organization to new levels of success and visibility.  Under Boesch’s leadership, Houston Wrestling quickly attained gained a reputation as one of the top regional wrestling promotions of its time. Promoters such as [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]] ([[World Class Championship Wrestling]]) and wrestlers such as [[Barry Darsow]] would repeatedly praise Boesch's acumen and honesty as a promoter and businessman.  Boesch is also credited with the invention of [[mud wrestling]], a concept he devised for a major match between [[Gus Sonnenberg]] and [[Harnam Singh]] in [[Seattle, Washington]].

Together with his nephew Peter Birkholz, Boesch entered Houston Wrestling into affiliations with [[Mid South Wrestling]], [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]], [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]], and [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] to ensure that top talent from all over the country would appear on his weekly Friday Night shows.  As professional wrestling became a major entertainment business in the 1980s, most of Boesch's affiliates joined the [[National Wrestling Alliance]]. Boesch eventually shut down Houston Wrestling in favor of signing with [[Vince McMahon]] and the World Wrestling Federation, an affiliation that lasted only four months.

After 55 years of working in the industry as a wrestler, announcer, and promoter, Paul Boesch retired on August 28, 1987 due to health concerns. The now-WWE hosted the Paul Boesch Retirement Show in Houston in his honor, which drew a sell-out crowd to the [[Sam Houston Coliseum]]. During the show, personal friend and then-[[Vice President]] [[George H. W. Bush|George Bush]] had a telegram delivered praising Boesch for his lifelong commitment to service.

==Death==
Boesch died on March 7, 1989 after suffering a [[heart attack]] in [[Sugar Land, Texas]].  He was inducted into the [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame]] as a charter member in 1996.  He was inducted into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] in 2005 as a non-wrestler participant in the business.

==Legacy==
Paul Boesch's contribution to the wrestling industry has been praised by numerous observers as well as by former wrestlers themselves.  [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] commentator [[Jim Ross]] has publicly stated that he believes Boesch is worthy of enshrinement in the [[WWE Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jrsbarbq.com/blog/too-early-think-about-2009-wwe-hall-fame-fox-news-join-elitists-who-look-down-their-noses-wrest |title=Too Early to Think About the 2009 WWE Hall of Fame??.. Fox News Join Elitists Who Look Down Their Noses at Wrestling.. WWE Brand |author=Jim Ross |date=April 12, 2008 |work=J.R.'s Blog |publisher=JRsBarBQ.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame states that "his influence in professional wrestling cannot be overestimated" due to his expansive promotion of the sport throughout Texas.  Through his efforts, Boesch turned Houston into one of the top promotions on the regional wrestling circuit.  In addition to his professional accomplishments, Boesch was active in numerous philanthropic endeavors throughout his life.  He was a highly visible fixture in the community during his many years in Houston, serving in charitable organizations like the Boys Club and promoting the benefits and necessity of physical fitness for America's youth.  To generations of Houstonians and Texans in general, Boesch was the face of professional wrestling.

==Bibliography==
During his life, Boesch wrote four books:
* ''Road to Huertgen: Forest in Hell'' (1962), his story as a soldier in World War II.
* ''Much of Me in Each of These'' (1966), a book of poetry composed by Boesch himself.
* ''The Career of Paul Boesch-- One Man, One Sport, One Lifetime-- 50 years on the mat'' (1981), an autobiography.
* ''Hey Boy- Where'd You Get Them Ears?'' (2001), a secondary autobiography including his later memoirs.

'''''Pearls Before Swine''''', (also known as '''''Pearls''''') is an American [[comic strip]] written and illustrated by [[Stephan Pastis]]. It chronicles the daily lives of five [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals: a [[Pig]], a [[Rat]], a [[Zebra]], a [[Goat]], and a [[fraternity]] of [[crocodiles]],&lt;ref name=crassmenagerp32 /&gt; as well as a number of supporting characters. Each character represents an aspect of Pastis' own personality and world view.&lt;ref name=hogans&gt;{{cite news| url  = http://cartoonician.com/swine-connoisseur-the-stephan-pastis-interview/ |title=Swine Connoisseur: The Stephan Pastis Interview | work=[[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]]| issue= 16| date= 2009| accessdate= June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The daily and Sunday comic strip is distributed by [[Universal Uclick]] (by [[United Media]]'s United Feature Syndicate before 2011).

The strip's style is most notable for its dark humor, breaking of the [[fourth wall]], mockery of other comic strips and stories concocted in elaborate fashion leading into a pun.

== Publication history==
Prior to creating ''Pearls Before Swine'', Pastis worked as a lawyer in California.&lt;ref name="BLT"/&gt; Bored in his law school classes, Pastis started to doodle a rat, eventually casting it in a non-syndicated comic strip which he titled ''Rat''. The title character of Rat would later become one of the main characters in ''Pearls Before Swine''. Pastis continued to draw comics; the character Pig came from a failed strip titled ''The Infirm''.

In 1999, Pastis first submitted ''Pearls Before Swine'' to syndicates. Several expressed interest and three accepted it,&lt;ref name="forum"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Forum Interview with Stephan Pastis, Creator of Pearls Before Swine | year=2004| journal=Phi Kappa Phi Forum |volume=84|issue=3|pages=34&amp;ndash;37| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-121875458.html }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they could not convince their sales staff that it was marketable. However, Amy Lago, an editor at [[United Media]], saw the strip's potential and launched it on the United Media website in November 2000, to see what kind of response it would generate. Pastis recalled in 2009,
{{quote|United signed me in December 1999, and they put me in development ... where the syndicate says, OK, you were funny in your submission packet, but for all we know, it took you 10 years to come up with these 30 strips. So we want you to keep drawing, and we’ll watch you. If you’re good, we’ll agree to put you in newspapers. A development period can be anywhere from two weeks to a year. Not all cartoonists have to do it, but most do.&lt;ref name=hogans /&gt;}}

''Pearls Before Swine'' debuted in 2000 as a website strip under [[United Media|United Feature Syndicate]]. When [[Scott Adams]], creator of ''[[Dilbert]]'' and supporter of the strip, told his fans about ''Pearls Before Swine'', interest skyrocketed, and the strip was taken to print. Aiding Pastis in the artistic elements of the strip was [[Darby Conley]], creator of the comic strip ''[[Get Fuzzy]]''.&lt;ref name="BLT"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pastis|first=Steven|title=Pearls Before Swine: BLTs Taste So Darn Good|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|year=2003|pages=7–8|isbn=0-7407-3437-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QlmCVygKub8C&amp;dq=pearls+before+swine&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United Feature Syndicate launched the strip in newspapers on December 31, 2001 in ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pastis, Stephan, ''Sgt. Piggy's Lonely Hearts Club Comic'' (Andrews McMeel Publishing, 2004; {{ISBN|0-7407-4807-6}}), p.5: "''Pearls'' was supposed to launch in newspapers on January 7, 2002. But just prior to the launch, the ''Washington Post'' bought the strip and wanted to start running it a week early. Thus, this week of strips [dated beginning 12/31] was quickly put together just for the ''Post'', and this [12/31] strip became the first ''Pearls'' strip, published in exactly one paper".&lt;/ref&gt; On January 7, 2002, ''Pearls'' was running in approximately 150 papers.&lt;ref name="ammp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/products/?isbn=0740738135 |title='&amp;#39;This Little Piggy Stayed Home'&amp;#39; (March 2004): "Product Detail" |publisher=Andrewsmcmeel.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927043246/http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/products/?isbn=0740738135 |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, the strip has been appearing in 750 newspapers worldwide.&lt;ref name="blog_about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stephanpastis.wordpress.com/about/ |title=About Pearls Before Swine |publisher=Stephanpastis.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2014-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dwyer&gt;Dwyer, Ed. [https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2016/11/the-funny-papers/ "CULTURE: The Funny Papers: Newspapers may be in trouble, but the comic strip is alive and well — and flourishing online,"] ''Saturday Evening Post'' (November 7, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Influences==
''Pearls''{{'}} style and humor are inspired by several comic strips, chiefly ''[[Peanuts]]'', ''Dilbert'', ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'', ''[[Bloom County]]'' and ''[[The Far Side]]''. Pastis has drawn tributes to these influences in his strip. When asked in an interview about whether his profession as an attorney inspired the humor in the comic, he said, "I was very unhappy as a lawyer, and humor is a reaction to and defense against unhappiness.... if you dislike what you’re doing to the extent that I did, it gives you the impetus to get out."&lt;ref name="jd"&gt;{{cite web|author=in Attorney Career Success Stories |url=http://www.jdblissblog.com/2006/11/stephan_pastis_.html |title=Interview: Stephan Pastis: Attorney Turned Cartoonist |publisher=Jdblissblog.com |date=November 6, 2006 |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartoonist Darby Conley, creator of ''[[Get Fuzzy]]'', helped teach Pastis the technical aspects of cartooning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/books/05/03/pastis.pearls/index.html|title=A Rat, a Pig and Some Really Dumb Crocodiles: Stephan Pastis dives deep for his 'Pearls Before Swine' strip|last=Leopold|first=Todd|date=May 4, 2006|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two remain friends, sometimes poking fun at each other in their strips.

==Characters==
{{main article|List of Pearls Before Swine characters}}
{{Original research|date=June 2009}}

===Rat===
Rat (debut: December 30, 2001) is a [[narcissism|narcissistic]], misanthropic [[rat]], the [[antihero]] of the comic strip. He frequently breaks the [[fourth wall]].

Rat is an insensitive character in the strip, whose interactions with others are typically sarcastic, condescending, self-centered, insulting and often violent. In particular, he will frequently berate his creator on the general quality of the strip. Often self-employed, most of his businesses involve either punishing or [[Fraud|defrauding]] people for their ignorance, much in the same vein as [[Dogbert]], though with darker humor. His political views are right-wing, especially in foreign policy.

Rat's short stories, which are mostly extremely cynical reflections on life and love, make up several comic strips.

Pastis has mentioned that the character of Rat is his "voice" and that he identifies himself with Rat more than any other character.&lt;ref name="cb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crescentblues.com/8_9issue/int_pastis.shtml |title=Artist Interview: "Stephan Pastis: Animal Attitude" |publisher=Crescent Blues |date= |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/dec/24/strip_deals_wry_pearls_wisdom/?living |title=Strip deals wry Pearls of wisdom / LJWorld.com |publisher=.ljworld.com |date=December 24, 2006 |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pig===
Pig (debut: December 30, 2001) is the character that receives the most abuse from Rat (though ironically, he is Rat's only friend). He is kind by nature, but extremely stupid.&lt;ref name="blog_about" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jd" /&gt; Pig's jokes generally involve his stupidity; Pastis once stated that Pig is easy to write for because he misunderstands everything said to him, and, once it is explained, he misunderstands the explanation. Pig has a habit of talking to inanimate objects such as food, stop lights, or bait. Pig's moody on-and-off girlfriend, Pigita, often misunderstands his ignorant statements and will often become violent toward him.

Pig loves to eat, including pork products, making him a [[Cannibalism in humans|cannibal]], although he appears to misunderstand this. Unlike the other characters, Pig almost never uses mock profanity.

===Goat===
Goat (debut: January 18, 2002) is the intellectual of the strip,&lt;ref name="blog_about" /&gt; usually appearing whenever there is a small issue dealing with a character or a conflict to be mediated. Goat has a hard time dealing with both Pig's stupidity and Rat's cruelty and occasional ignorance. He is sometimes seen telling other characters about various philosophical, political, and [[social issues]], though usually the others do not care.

Goat's real name is revealed as "Paris" in the September 21, 2007 strip; he claims "Goat" is his stage name.

In early strips, Goat has a beard; he first appears without it in the March 31, 2004 strip.

===Zebra===
{{original research|section|date=January 2015}}
Zebra (debut: February 4, 2002), also known as "zeeba neighba" (zebra neighbor) by the crocodiles, is a [[zebra]] who is often seen trying to patch up relations between his herd back home and its predators. Pastis has stated that the Zebra's only goal is to avoid being eaten by his inarticulate next-door neighbors, the crocodiles.&lt;ref name="blog_about" /&gt; Jokes involving Zebra usually involve his interactions with predators.

Because Stephan Pastis was once unable to draw lions, these particular predators were not shown in the strip until May 31, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2007/05/31|title=Pearls Before Swine by Stephan Pastis for May 31, 2007|last=|first=|date=May 31, 2007|website=GoComics|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when two of them moved next door to Zebra, on the opposite side from the crocodiles. Zebra's lion neighbors, however, are male lions, which do not hunt, and they awkwardly remain friends.

Prior to their appearance, Zebra has been corresponding with the lions by mail.

===Guard Duck===
The Guard Duck is, as his name implies, is the "guard duck" for Pig and Rat's home.&lt;ref name="blog_about" /&gt;

His first appearance was March 14, 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2005/03/14 |title=Pearls Before Swine Comic Strip, March 14, 2005 on |publisher=Gocomics.com |date=March 14, 2005 |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Pig bought him instead of a more expensive guard dog for the house.

Originally, Guard Duck was described as a violent duck with [[anger management]] problems, but he transformed into a deluded soldier who sees the world as his battlefield. He responds to neighborhood problems militaristically, often using excessive violence (usually with an [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]], his usual weapon).

In the treasury ''The Crass Menagerie'', Stephan Pastis remarks that the Guard Duck has become so popular that he's become a sixth main character (after Rat, Pig, Goat, Zebra, and the crocs).&lt;ref name=crassmenagerp32&gt;{{cite book|title=The Crass Menagerie|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crocodiles===
The ZZE fraternity of crocodiles (whose name supposedly means "Zeta Zeta Epsilon" but actually means "Zeeba Zeeba Eata") is described by Pastis as "inept and inarticulate neighbors" of Zebra.&lt;ref name="blog_about" /&gt; They repeatedly attempt to kill and eat Zebra, but fail every time as a result of their stupidity.
Each croc has very little regard for his fellow crocs' lives; dozens of crocs have died in their botched attempts to kill Zebra. They speak in a "language" called "Croc-ese": English with very bad grammar and pronunciation. According to Pastis, "Croc-ese" is not meant to imitate any accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/12/13/Floridian/Exactly_what_ees_that.shtml|title=Exactly what ees that zeeba-eating accent|last=Squires|first=Chase|date=December 13, 2005|website=Tampa Bay Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132802/http://www.sptimes.com/2005/12/13/Floridian/Exactly_what_ees_that.shtml|archive-date=March 4, 2016|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are on poor terms with all five main characters (with the possible occasional exception of Rat).

In addition to the fraternity of crocodiles, there is a separate family of crocodiles that live in the neighborhood and are also neighbors to Zebra. The family consists of Larry, his wife Patty, and their son Junior (originally named Billy). Larry is a typical croc similar to those in the fraternity: he is also characterized by his stupidity and his failure to kill Zebra. In contrast, both his wife and son are intelligent and do not speak "Croc-ese". Patty is a housewife with a [[Bob cut|bob haircut]]. She is often frustrated with her husband's insensitivity and stupidity and even responds with physical violence in many cases. Despite this, Patty is still shown to love her husband. Junior is the only child of his family. He is a vegetarian, and also loves his father.

===Stephan Pastis===
Stephan Pastis appears self-reflexively in the strip. He is often seen with Rat, who makes him the target of criticism about his artwork and jokes involving puns. His character has also expressed his hate of being an attorney, which was his former career. He is usually depicted wearing a baseball cap backward, a plain white T-shirt, and blue jeans.

===Snuffles===
Snuffles (also known as Mister Snuffles) is Zebra's cat. Originally, he was adopted by the crocodiles on September 30, 2007, to kill Zebra, but the plan backfired. He does not talk like the other characters, only saying "Meow" (but the other characters can understand what he says). However, he is still shown to have human-like intelligence. While he is always obedient and good-natured to Zebra, he can be violent to others. He often commits illegal or immoral acts, which range from [[Ticket resale|scalping tickets]] to hiding weapons of mass destruction. Snuffles is often seen with Guard Duck.

===Semi-regular characters===

*'''Jef the Cyclist''' - A parody of an arrogant cyclist. He is loosely based on [[Jef Mallett]], the creator of the comic strip ''[[Frazz]]''.
*'''Andy''' - A chained-up dog who dreams of being unchained. His optimism contrasts with the darkness of the comic strip.
*'''Farina''' - Pig's sister, a [[mysophobia|germaphobe]] who lives in a plastic bubble. She is Rat's ex-girlfriend.
*'''Pigita''' - Pig's on-and-off girlfriend.
*'''Neighbor Bob''' - Rat and Pig's next-door neighbor, with whom Rat frequently fights.
*'''Vikings''' - Pig’s [[Viking]] figurines; instead of killing people and plundering villages like most Vikings (which they should be, according to Rat) they prefer to watch shows like ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' and ''[[The Ellen Degeneres Show]]''.
*'''Lemmings''' - A group of four (sometimes five) [[lemmings]] that always contemplate jumping off a cliff. This is based on a myth created by a 1950s [[Disney Nature]] film about lemmings.
*'''Comic Strip Censor''' - A man who gets mad whenever a character (usually Rat or Pig) would say something close to being offensive. This character often allows Stephan to get away with making dirty jokes in the strip because "No newspaper editor wants to censor [it] and risk looking like [him]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pastis |first=Stephan |page=153 |authorlink=Stephan Pastis |date=2015 |title=Pearls Gets Sacrificed}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Staci Pastis''' - Stephan’s ex-wife. Stephan lives in a basket outside her house.
*'''Max and Zach''' - Two [[lions]] that live next door to Zebra, but they won’t eat him because it’s the female lions that do the hunting.
*'''Mr. Death''' - Rat and Pig’s [[grim reaper]] neighbor. His appearance confuses people that would think that he’s there to kill them, when he isn’t.
*'''Chuckie''' - A non-anthropomorphic [[sheep]].
*'''Killer Whale''' - An unnamed [[killer whale]] that is also a very bad predator.
*'''John and Jennifer''' - Two [[Pinniped|seals]] that the whale tries to eat.
*'''Bombast Cable''' - Rat and Pig’s cable company, who Rat always has trouble with on the phone.
*'''Gary''' - Owner of Joe’s Roastery, a [[coffee]] shop Rat on-and-off works at.
*'''Jeffy''' - A character from ''[[The Family Circus]]'' that appears in ''Pearls'' every time the former strip is parodied.

==Setting==
The strip is set in a fictional suburb in [[Albany, California]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Venues where the characters can be found include a brick wall, a beach, a curb, a bar, and a diner.

==Style==
Artistically, ''Pearls'' is extremely simple. Pastis stated, "People say that they like my strip's simplicity, but I'm doing the best I can to just to get up to that level. I'm not dumbing the art down."&lt;ref name="forum" /&gt;

''Pearls'' is a [[meta-joke|meta-comic]] in that it often satirizes the comics medium, and its characters frequently break the [[fourth wall]]. Characters frequently communicate with the author or with characters from other strips. Some strips are based on the premise that the characters live in a comic strip: for example, the strip published on January 14, 2008, had "roof fish" sitting on top of the panel fishing for the characters, and other strips have had smeared [[newsprint]] or beer affect the appearance of the strip.

''Pearls'' will often also mock older strips, such as ''[[Cathy]]'' and ''[[The Family Circus]]''. The frequent comedic jabs at long-running comic strips has earned Pastis the disdain of many comic artists, which the author referenced in a storyline where the ''Pearls'' cast is not invited to the 75th-anniversary [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] party of ''[[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2005/9/23|title=Pearls Before Swine by Stephan Pastis for Sep 23, 2005|last=|first=|date=September 23, 2005|website=GoComics|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pastis will often employ a [[shaggy dog story]], using a great amount of dialogue to spin an elaborate premise often resolved with a character's unforeseen death or near death. A variation known as a [[feghoot]] builds to an intentionally bad [[pun]] in the penultimate panel, with the final panel showing the cartoon version of Pastis as the target of criticism, hostility, or even physical violence from the characters, usually Rat.

''Pearls'' uses [[Black comedy|dark humor]], at times involving topics such as death, depression and human suffering.

==Other media==
In an interview on ''[[The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch]]'' that aired on February 7, 2008, Pastis mentioned that he had been approached by producers about an animated TV series based on ''Pearls''.

In 2009, a line of ''Pearls'' plush dolls was released by Aurora World, Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=info@auroragift.com |url=http://www.auroragift.com/new_web/product/product_010.php |title=Pearls Before Swine at Aurora |publisher=Auroragift.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring four characters (Rat, Pig, Zebra and Croc) from the comic, to which Pastis jokingly said he would use for reference when unsure how to draw the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavna |first=Michael |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2009/03/plush_pearls_toys_yes--what_a.html |title=Plush 'Pearls' Toys? Indeed-What a Croc! |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date=March 25, 2009 |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 20, 2010, [[RingTales]] launched their series of animated ''Pearls'' strips on [[Babelgum]]. Pastis has since begun to release these cartoons on [[YouTube]].

==Awards==
Pastis won the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s [[National Cartoonists Society Division Awards|Division Award]] for Best Newspaper Comic Strip for ''Pearls'' in 2003, 2006 and 2014.&lt;ref name="ncsaward"&gt;{{cite web

The '''''Rawalpindi Gazetteer''''' or [[Gazetteer]] of the [[Rawalpindi District]] 1893-94, is a comprehensive geographical, economic, social and cultural catalogue of Rawalpindi District. It was compiled and published in 1895 during the [[British Raj|British period]].

With 268 pages it gives an interesting picture of that period. [[Attock District]] is also included in it as it was part of Rawalpindi District. This gazetteer is part of a series district [[gazetteer]]s published in [[British India]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22280">The '''Sakura catalog''' is a [[Japan]]ese [[stamp catalog]] illustrated in colors.

'''The Japanese Stamp Catalog Illustrated in Colors''' ({{lang-ja|[[:ja:原色日本切手図鑑|原色日本切手図鑑]]}}) was first published in October 1967, with fuII-colored illustrations, which surprised the philatelic world since a colored stamp catalog had never been thought of. Regarded as the most reliable and popular publication in Japan, it goes through fifteen editions in 1979, and more than 4,500,000 copies have been released in all. This is the companion volume to the '''Japanese Stamp Specialized Catalog'''. The catalog, nicknamed '''Sakura Catalog''', has been in pocket-size (118 x 148 mm) for several years, but now it is printed in the size of B6 (128 x 182 mm) so that it may be printed through the multicolor rotary press to meet the increased circulation and to make the use of thinner paper possible. On the occasion that all the pages have to be newly composed for the enlarged size, the English version of [[Postage stamp|stamp]] names is added for the sake of foreign collectors, and many marks are adopted to help them understand how the stamps are classified here.&lt;ref name="sakura83"&gt;SAKURA Catalog of Japanese Stamps, Illustrated in Colours 1983. 18th Edition. Edited and Published by the Japan Philatelic Society, Inc. 1982.09.05. The size of B6 (128&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;182&amp;nbsp;mm). 240&amp;nbsp;p.

It also includes facts, ideas, and instructions for preparing the meat, as well as a brief history of bacon, a discussion of the folklore surrounding the meat, and a glossary of bacon-related items.&lt;ref name="courant"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/1170580271.html?dids=1170580271:1170580271&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Nov+30%2C+2006&amp;author=LINDA+GIUCA%3B+Courant+Food+Editor&amp;pub=Hartford+Courant&amp;desc=A+SIZZLING+STORY+OF+SEDUCTION|title=A Sizzling Story of Seduction|last=Giuca|first=Linda|date=2006-11-30|publisher=Hartford Courant|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/22/dining/22book.html?ref=dining|title=Selections Bound to Entice the Cook or the Historian |last=Fabricant|first=Florence|date=2006-11-22|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also provides information on the use of bacon, listing curing techniques, tips on buying and storing bacon and the best ways to cook it.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="philly" /&gt;

''Seduced by Bacon'' includes bacon-related writings from notables such as [[Mark Twain]] and [[Fran Lebowitz]].&lt;ref name="arizona"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/fromcomments_byauthor/161926.php|title=Bring home the bacon — and savor it |last=Sweets|first=Ellen|date=2006-12-27|publisher=Arizona Daily Star|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains photographs and bacon-related poems:

==Reception==
First printed on October 1, 2006, ''Seduced by Bacon'' was reprinted 3 times by March 9, 2007.&lt;ref name="nydn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/food/2007/02/21/2007-02-21_bring_home_the_bacon_.html|title=Bring Home the Bacon...|date=2007-03-09|last=Wharton|first=Rachel|publisher=NY Daily News|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was featured on a Saturday edition of [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Early Show]]'' in a segment called "Chef on a Shoestring", where a three-course meal consisting of recipes from the book was created for four people for $40.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/04/earlyshow/saturday/chef/main2153242.shtml|title=Bacon Makes It All Better|date=2006-11-04|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The menu featured a warm baby spinach salad with oranges, red onion and bacon as a starter; Chinese glazed salmon for the main course and pecan, brown sugar and bacon ice cream for dessert.&lt;ref name="cbs" /&gt;

One reviewer described the book as capturing a big food trend: the use of bacon to flavor everything from pasta dishes to sweets.&lt;ref name="philly"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/dailynews/columnists/bernard_fernandez/20070118_inq_food_FD1MORN.html|title=Slow down!

The '''Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation''' is a nonprofit organization founded in 1937 by philanthropist [[Solomon R. Guggenheim]] and his long-time art advisor, artist [[Hilla von Rebay]].  The foundation is a leading institution for the collection, preservation, and research of [[modern art|modern]] and [[contemporary art]] and operates several museums around the world.  The first museum established by the foundation was The Museum of Non-Objective Painting, in New York City.  This became [[The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in 1952, and the foundation moved the collection into its first permanent museum building, in New York City, in 1959. The foundation next opened the [[Peggy Guggenheim Collection]] in Venice, Italy, in 1980. Its international network of museums expanded in 1997 to include the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] in [[Bilbao]], Spain, and it expects to open a new museum, [[Guggenheim Abu Dhabi]], in the United Arab Emirates in 2017.

The mission of the foundation is "to promote the understanding and appreciation of art, architecture, and other manifestations of visual culture, primarily of the modern and contemporary periods, and to collect, conserve, and study" modern and contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/guggenheim-foundation/mission-statement "Mission Statement"], Solomon R.

Guggenheim Museum, is housed in a modern spiral building designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and the Guggenheim Bilbao was designed by [[Frank Gehry]].  Both of these innovative designs received wide press and critical attention.  The Peggy Guggenheim Collection is housed in an 18th-century Italian palace, the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni, on the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]].

The permanent collection of the foundation is based primarily on nine private collections: Solomon R.

Dreier]]'s gift of paintings and sculptures; Peggy Guggenheim's collection, concentrating on [[Abstraction (art)|abstraction]] and [[surrealism]]; Justin K. and Hilde Thannhauser's collection of [[impressionist]], [[post-impressionist]], and early modern masterpieces; part of Hilla von Rebay's collection; [[Giuseppe Panza|Giuseppe Panza di Biumo's]] holdings of American [[minimalist art|minimalist]], [[Postminimalism|post-minimalist]], [[Environmental art|environmental]] and [[conceptual art]] of the 1960s and 1970s; a collection of photographs and mixed media from the [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] Foundation; and the Bohen Foundation's collection of film, video, photography and new media.&lt;ref name=cork&gt;[http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/museums/guggenheim-new-york.htm "Guggenheim Museum New York"], ''Encyclopedia of Art'', visual-arts-cork.com.

==History==

===Hilla Rebay and early years===
[[Solomon R. Guggenheim]], a member of a wealthy mining family, began collecting works of the [[old masters]] in the 1890s.  He retired from his business in 1919 to devote more time to art collecting.  In 1926, at age 66, he met artist [[Hilla von Rebay]], who was commissioned by Guggenheim's wife, Irene Rothschild, to paint his portrait.&lt;ref name=artdaily&gt;[http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=31711&amp;int_modo=2 "Exhibition of Works Reflecting the Evolution of the Guggenheim's Collection Opens in Bilbao"], artdaily.org, 2009. Retrieved April 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Rebay introduced him to European [[avant-garde]] art, in particular abstract art that she felt had a spiritual and utopian aspect ([[non-objective art]]).&lt;ref name=artdaily/&gt; Guggenheim completely changed his collecting strategy.&lt;ref name=past&gt;[http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/hilla_rebay/biographies_2.html "Biography: Solomon R.

The same year, Guggenheim began to display the collection to the public at his apartment in the [[Plaza Hotel]] in New York City.  Guggenheim's purchases continued with the works of [[Rudolf Bauer (artist)|Rudolf Bauer]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Robert Delaunay]], and great artists who were not of the non-objective school, such as [[Marc Chagall]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[László Moholy-Nagy]].&lt;ref name=artdaily/&gt;&lt;ref name=past/&gt;

In 1937, Guggenheim established the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation to foster the appreciation of [[modern art]].&lt;ref name=past/&gt;  The foundation's first venue for the display of art was called the "Museum of Non-Objective Painting".  It opened in 1939 under the direction of Rebay, its first curator, in a former automobile showroom at East 54th Street in [[midtown Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;Vail, pp. 25 and 36&lt;/ref&gt;  This moved, in 1947, to another rented space at 1071 [[Fifth Avenue]].&lt;ref name=past/&gt;  Under Rebay's guidance, Guggenheim sought to include in the collection the most important examples of non-objective art available at the time, such as  Kandinsky's ''Composition 8'' (1923), Léger's ''Contrast of Forms'' (1913) and Delaunay's ''Simultaneous Windows'' (2nd Motif, 1st Part)'' (1912).&lt;ref name=Calnek&gt;Calnek, Anthony, et al.

By the early 1940s, the foundation had accumulated such a large collection of avant-garde paintings that the need for a permanent building to house the art collection had become apparent.&lt;ref name=Winter&gt;Winter, Damon.

After Guggenheim's death, members of the Guggenheim family who sat on the foundation's board of directors had personal and philosophical differences with Rebay, and in 1952 she resigned as director of the museum.&lt;ref name=Rebaybio/&gt;  Nevertheless, she left a portion of her personal collection to the foundation in her will, including works by Kandinsky, Klee, [[Alexander Calder]], Gleizes, [[Piet Mondrian]] and [[Kurt Schwitters]].&lt;ref name=cork/&gt;

In 1953, the foundation's collecting boundaries extended even further under its new director, [[James Johnson Sweeney]].  Sweeney rejected Rebay's dismissal of "objective" painting and sculpture, and he soon acquired [[Constantin Brâncuși]]'s ''Adam and Eve'' (1921), followed by works of other modernist sculptors, including [[Jean Arp]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Alberto Giacometti]] and [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]].&lt;ref name=Calnek/&gt;  Sweeney reached beyond the 20th century to acquire [[Paul Cézanne]]'s ''Man with Crossed Arms'' (c. 1899).&lt;ref name=Calnek/&gt;  In 1953, the foundation received a gift of 28 important works from the Estate of [[Katherine S. Dreier]], a founder of America's first collection to be called a modern art museum, the [[Société Anonyme]].  Dreier had been a colleague of Rebay's. The works included ''Little French Girl'' (1914–18) by Brâncuși, an untitled still life (1916) by [[Juan Gris]], a bronze sculpture (1919) by [[Alexander Archipenko]] and three collages (1919–21) by German Hanoverian [[Dadaist]] Schwitters.

===Messer and the ramp===
[[File:New York by Piotrus 005.JPG|left|thumb|The Guggenheim's gallery – part of the spiral ramp]] 
[[Thomas M. Messer]] succeeded Sweeney as director of the museum (but not the foundation) in 1961 and stayed for 27 years, the longest tenure of any of the city's major arts institutions' directors.&lt;ref name=BioInContext&gt;{{Citation |chapter= Thomas M.

It turned out that the combination could work well in the Guggenheim's space, but, Messer recalled that at the time, "I was scared. I half felt that this would be my last exhibition."&lt;ref name=Russell1987a/&gt; Messer had the foresight to prepare by staging a smaller sculpture exhibition the previous year, in which he discovered how to compensate for the space's weird geometry by constructing special [[plinth]]s at a particular angle, so the pieces were not at a true vertical yet appeared to be so.&lt;ref name=Canaday1962/&gt; In the earlier sculpture show, this trick proved impossible for one piece, an [[Alexander Calder]] [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile]] whose wire inevitably hung at a true [[Plumb-bob|plumb]] vertical, "suggesting hallucination" in the disorienting context of the tilted floor.&lt;ref name=Canaday1962/&gt;

The next year, Messer acquired a private collection from art dealer Justin K. Thannhauser for the foundation's permanent collection.&lt;ref&gt;Decker, Andrew.

==Architecture==
The foundation has long sought, in its constituent museums, to unite its artworks with distinguished architecture.  In 1943, Hilla von Rebay and Solomon R. Guggenheim commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to build the foundation's first permanent museum.&lt;ref&gt;Bianchini, Riccardo. [http://www.inexhibit.com/case-studies/the-guggenheim-museum-an-american-revolution/ "The Guggenheim Museum, an American Revolution"], Inexhibit museum magazine, accessed July 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Rebay wrote to Wright that "each of these great masterpieces should be organized into space, and only you ... would test the possibilities to do so. …  I want a temple of spirit, a monument!"&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant achievement, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, in New York City, testifies not only to Wright's architectural genius, but also to the adventurous spirit that characterized its founders.&lt;ref name="Levine, p. 362"&gt;Levine, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;  The critic [[Paul Goldberger]] later wrote that, before Wright's modernist building, "there were only two common models for museum design: [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-arts]] Palace ... and the International Style Pavilion."&lt;ref name=Secret&gt;[https://archive.is/20130119180543/http://www.colebrookbossonsaunders.com/The-Secret-Life-of-Buildings-New-York-Public-Library-and-Guggenheim "The Secret Life of Buildings: New York Public Library and Guggenheim Museum"], Colebrook Bosson Saunders Products Ltd.. Retrieved March 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Goldberger thought the building a catalyst for change, making it "socially and culturally acceptable for an architect to design a highly expressive, intensely personal museum. In this sense almost every museum of our time is a child of the Guggenheim."&lt;ref name=Secret/&gt;

===New York===
[[Image:guggenheim flw show.jpg|thumb|right|An interior view of the museum]]
Before settling on the present site for the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum on Fifth Avenue between 88th and 89th Streets, Wright, Rebay and Guggenheim considered numerous locations in Manhattan, as well as in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, overlooking the [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref name=Ballon&gt;Ballon, pp. 22–27&lt;/ref&gt;  Guggenheim felt that the site's proximity to Central Park was important;  the park afforded relief from the noise, congestion and concrete of the city.&lt;ref name=Storrer401&gt;Storrer, pp. 400–01&lt;/ref&gt;  Nature also provided the museum with inspiration.&lt;ref name=Ballon/&gt; The building embodies Wright's attempts "to render the inherent plasticity of organic forms in architecture."&lt;ref name=Levine340&gt;Levine, p. 340&lt;/ref&gt;  The Guggenheim was to be the only museum designed by Wright.  The city location required Wright to design the building in a vertical rather than a horizontal form, far different from his earlier, rural works.&lt;ref name=Storrer401/&gt;

Wright's original concept was called an inverted "[[ziggurat]]", because it resembled the steep steps on the ziggurats built in ancient [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name=Storrer401/&gt; His design dispensed with the conventional approach to museum layout, in which visitors are led through a series of interconnected rooms and forced to retrace their steps when exiting.&lt;ref name=Levine340/&gt;  Wright's plan was for the museum guests to ride to the top of the building by elevator, to descend at a leisurely pace along the gentle slope of the continuous ramp, and to view the atrium of the building as the last work of art.  The open rotunda afforded viewers the unique possibility of seeing several bays of work on different levels simultaneously and even to interact with guests on other levels.&lt;ref name=ArchDaily&gt;Perez, Adelyn.

Even as it embraced nature, Wright's design also expresses his take on modernist architecture's rigid geometry.&lt;ref name=Levine301/&gt;  Wright ascribed a symbolic meaning to the building's shapes.  He explained, "these geometric forms suggest certain human ideas, moods, sentiments – as for instance: the circle, infinity; the triangle, structural unity; the spiral, organic progress; the square, integrity."&lt;ref&gt;Rudenstine, Angelica Zander. ''The Guggenheim Museum Collection: Paintings, 1880–1945'',  New York: Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1976, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;  Forms echo one another throughout: oval-shaped columns, for example, reiterate the geometry of the fountain. Circularity is the leitmotif, from the rotunda to the inlaid design of the terrazzo floors.&lt;ref name=Ballon/&gt;

[[Image:Guggenheim New York.jpg|300px|thumb|left|The Guggenheim atrium, looking up at the skylight]]
Wright's vision took 16 years to be fulfilled. Set in sharp contrast to typically rectangular Manhattan buildings that surround it, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum building opened in October 1959.  Even before it opened, the design polarized architecture critics.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewsandCourier/&gt;  Some believed that the building would overshadow the museum's artworks.&lt;ref name=Winter/&gt;&lt;ref name=History1&gt;[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/guggenheim-museum-opens-in-new-york-city “Oct 21, 1959: Guggenheim Museum opens in New York City”], This Day in History, History.com.

The building's surface was made out of concrete to reduce the cost, inferior to the stone finish that Wright had wanted.&lt;ref name=Sennott572&gt;Sennott, pp. 572–73&lt;/ref&gt;  The small rotunda (or "Monitor building", as Wright called it) next to the large rotunda was intended to house apartments for Rebay and Guggenheim but instead became offices and storage space.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1965, the second floor of the Monitor building was renovated to display the museum's growing permanent collection, and with the restoration of the museum in 1990–92, it was turned over entirely to exhibition space and christened the Thannhauser Building, in honor of one of the most important bequests to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Ballon, pp. 59–61&lt;/ref&gt;  Wright's original plan for an adjoining tower, artists' studios and apartments went unrealized, largely for financial reasons.  However, as part of the restoration, architects [[Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates Architects|Gwathmey Siegel and Associates]] analyzed Wright's original sketches to design the rectangular 10-story limestone tower, that stands behind, and taller than, the original spiral building (replacing a much smaller structure), which has four additional exhibition galleries with flat walls that are "more appropriate for the display of art."&lt;ref name=GSwebsite/&gt;&lt;ref name=ArchDaily/&gt;  Also in the original construction, the main gallery skylight had been covered, which compromised Wight's carefully articulated lighting effects.

In 2001, the museum opened the Sackler Center for Arts Education to the public, which was another part of Wright's original design for the building, through a gift of the Mortimer D. Sackler family.

The works are expected to be exhibited at the museum in New York in three exhibitions between 2014 and 2017 and also at the other Guggenheim museums.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/AP26bfc374299447738164aea735b02c72 "Guggenheim launches Chinese art initiative"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107022213/https://www.wsj.com/articles/AP26bfc374299447738164aea735b02c72 |date=November 7, 2017 }}, ''The Wall Street Journal'', Associated Press, March 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The commissions are part of an effort by the museum to broaden the geographical scope of its collection, and the Robert H.N. Ho Family Foundation hopes that the collaboration will foster "a greater understanding of Chinese culture."&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Carol.

{{globalize/Eng|date=August 2018}}
A '''summons''' (also known in England and Wales as a '''claim form''' and in the Australian state of [[New South Wales]] as a '''Court Attendance Notice (CAN)''') is a legal document issued by a court (a ''judicial summons'') or by an administrative agency of government (an ''administrative summons'') for various purposes.

==Judicial summons==
A judicial summons is served on a person involved in a legal proceeding. Legal action may be in progress against the person, or the person's presence as witness may be required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/criminal/docs/crim-pr-form-part28-witness-summons-application-form-aug-2011.pdf Application for a witness summons under criminal law of England and Wales]&lt;/ref&gt; In the former case, the summons will typically announce to the person to whom it is directed that a legal proceeding has been started against that person, and that a case has been initiated in the issuing court. In some jurisdictions, it may be drafted in [[legal English]] difficult for the [[layman]] to understand, while several U.S. states expressly require summonses to be drafted in [[plain English]] and that they must start with this phrase: "Notice! You have been sued."{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The summons announces a date by which the person or persons summoned must either appear in court, or respond in writing to the court or the opposing party or parties. The summons is the descendant of the [[writ]] of the [[common law]]. It replaces the former procedure in common-law countries by which the plaintiff actually had to ask the [[sheriff]] to arrest the defendant in order for the court to obtain [[personal jurisdiction]] in both criminal and civil actions.

==Types of summonses==

===Citation===
A '''citation''', '''traffic violation ticket''', or '''notice to appear''' is a type of summons prepared and served at the scene of the occurrence by a [[Police|law enforcement]] official, compelling the appearance of a defendant before the local [[magistrate]] within a certain period of time to answer for a minor [[Traffic ticket|traffic infraction]], [[misdemeanor]], or other [[summary offence]]. Failure to appear within the allotted period of time is a separate crime of [[failure to appear]].

In [[Australia]], minor traffic and some summary offences are known as an Infringement Notice or a [[Fine (penalty)|Fine]] and can be dealt with by paying a particular monetary amount depending on the offence. The accused person has the right to have the matter heard in a Court; if found not guilty the accused person pays nothing other than his legal costs (if any); if found guilty the accused person faces the prospect of a conviction for the offence and/or a substantial increase in the fine up to the maximum. For example, proceeding through a red light could go from A$353 up to A$2,200 if convicted in [[NSW]]. For more serious offences, a Field Court Attendance Notice is issued.

In the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, law enforcement officials may deal with certain minor offences, such as [[litter]]ing, by issuing a [[fixed penalty notice]], colloquially called an "on-the-spot fine", although legally they are not fines. They allow the recipient to avoid going to court by paying a penalty fixed by statute. If a notice is ignored or disputed, a court summons will be issued as for any other offence.

===Civil summons===
A civil summons is most often accompanied by a complaint. Depending on the type of summons, there is often an option to endorse a summons so that the entity being served may be identified. In the court system in California, for civil unlimited cases in the superior court, a summons will often have these options to endorse:
# as an individual;
# as the person sued under the fictitious name of __________________;
# on behalf of (usually for a company); or
# by personal delivery on __________

===Administrative summons===
One example of an administrative summons is found in the tax law of the United States. The [[Internal Revenue Code]] authorizes the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) to issue a summons for a taxpayer—or any person having custody of books of account relating to a business of a taxpayer—to appear before the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate (generally, this means the IRS employee who issued the summons) at the time and place named in the summons.&lt;ref&gt;The summons is generally executed on IRS Form 2039, Summons.&lt;/ref&gt; The person summoned may be required to produce books, papers, records, or other data, and to give testimony under oath before an IRS employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|26|7602|a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRS is also empowered to issue the section 7602 summons for the purpose of "inquiring into any offense connected with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws."&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|26|7602|b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The summons may be enforced by a court order,&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|7604}}. For background, see ''Schulz v. Internal Revenue Service'', 395 [[Federal Reporter|F.3d]] 463, 2005-1 U.S. Tax Cas. ([[CCH (company)|CCH]]) ¶ 50,165 (2d Cir. 2005) (''per curiam'').&lt;/ref&gt; and the law provides a criminal penalty of up to one year in prison or a fine, or both, for failure to obey the summons,&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|7210}}.&lt;/ref&gt; except that the person summoned may, to the extent applicable, assert a [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|privilege against self incrimination]] or other evidentiary privileges, if applicable.

In the U.S. immigration court system, a "Notice to Appear" is an administrative summons ordering a respondent to appear before an immigration court for [[removal proceedings]].

==Summonses by jurisdictions==

===Australia===
In the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) the service of a Court Attendance Notice can be issued in a number of ways, the most common of which is by the [[NSW Police Force]] when charging someone after an arrest is made, a Bail Court Attendance Notice (with bail conditions) or regular Court Attendance Notice is issued. Other methods the Police use include via a paper form called a Field Court Attendance Notice (Field CAN) which is issued to the accused person on the spot after an offence has been detected. Or by way of a Future Court Attendance Notice (Future CAN), which replaced the old court issued summons and is served in person by Police or sometimes by mail. In all of these cases, the CAN is filed at the court after it has been served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weatherburn|first1=Don|last2=Fitzgerald|first2=Jacqueline|title=The impact of the NSW Bail Act (2013) on trends in bail and remand in New South Wales|url=http://apo.org.au/node/56692|date=2015|publisher=NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research|page=2|isbn=978-1-921824-99-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===England and Wales===
Historically, in old English law, a summons was called an ''auxilium curiae'', although this term is now obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thelawdictionary.org/auxilium-curiae/|title=What is AUXILIUM CURIAE? definition of AUXILIUM CURIAE (Black's Law Dictionary)|website=thelawdictionary.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[England and Wales]], the term '''writ of summons''' for the originating document in civil proceedings has been replaced with the term ''claim form'' by the [[Civil Procedure Rules|Civil Procedure Rules 1999]] (CPR). This is part of the reforms to simplify legal terminology. However, despite its name, the claim form does not present the details of the claim itself (in other words, it does not replace the complaint). The complaint is now known as the ''particulars of claim''. 

In criminal matters, either a requisition, summons or warrant is issued to initiate criminal proceedings.

Signed by District Judge (Magistrates' Courts) Sally Fudge. This is a summons for a private prosecution.]]

===United States===
In most [[United States|U.S.]] jurisdictions, the service of a summons is in most cases required for the court to have jurisdiction over the party who is being summoned.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson]]'', {{ussc|444|286|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The process by which a summons is served is called [[service of process]]. The form and content of service in the federal courts is governed by Rule 4 of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]], and the rules of many state courts are similar. The federal summons is usually issued by the clerk of the court. In many states, the summons may be issued by an attorney, but some states use filing as the means to commence an action and in those states, the attorney must first file the summons in duplicate before it becomes effective. One or more copies are stamped by the court clerk with the court seal and returned to the attorney, who then uses it to actually serve the defendants. Other jurisdictions may only require that the summons be filed after it is served on the defendants. [[New York (state)|New York]] is distinguished by its permissive [[filing (legal)|filing]] system, in which the summons or complaint need not be filed at all.

[[File:Filmhuset 2009b.jpg|thumb|Filmhuset in [[Stockholm]], the seat of the Swedish Film Institute]]
The '''Swedish Film Institute''' ({{lang-sv|Svenska Filminstitutet}}) was founded in 1963 to support and develop the [[Swedish film industry]]. The institute is housed in the ''Filmhuset'' building located in [[Gärdet]], [[Östermalm]] in [[Stockholm]]. The building, completed in 1970, was designed by architect [[Peter Celsing]].

== Function ==
The Swedish Film Institute supports Swedish filmmaking and allocates grants for production, distribution and public showing of Swedish films in Sweden. It also promotes Swedish cinema internationally. Furthermore, the Institute organises the annual [[Guldbagge Awards]]. The [[Swedish Film Database]] is published by the institute.

Through the Swedish Film Agreement, between the Swedish state and the film and media industry, the [[Government of Sweden]], the TV companies which were party to the agreement, and Sweden's cinema owners jointly fund the Film Institute and thus, indirectly, Swedish filmmaking. The agreement ran from January 1, 2006, until December 31, 2012. The building also contains a large film archive and two theatres, named after [[Victor Sjöström]] and [[Mauritz Stiller]], which regularly arrange screenings of classic films.

'''''The Atlas of Pern''''' by [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] is an authorized companion book to the [[science fiction]] [[Dragonriders of Pern]] series by [[Anne McCaffrey]]. It was completed in 1984 based on the first seven Pern novels and collaboration with McCaffrey.

The Atlas is a large-format book comprising regional [[map]]s, [[chronologies]] for the seven published novels, local maps and drawings of "Hall, Hold, and Weyr", thematic maps on a world [[scale (map)|scale]], and notes. The Notes are page [[references]] to the [[canon (fiction)|canon]], a list of reference works, and an index of place names.

McCaffrey wrote in her "Welcome" that she had received in November 1983 "the first of Karen's renditions of my Pern, which rendered clearly what had been partially obscured by a myopic mind's eye: this ''is'' Pern! ... all lifted from the depths of my imagination and captured by Karen's draftsmanship and geographical expertise ...".&lt;ref&gt;"Welcome to Pern", ''The Atlas of Pern'' front endpapers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fonstad had earned a [[Master's degree]] in Geography, specializing in [[cartography]], from the [[University of Oklahoma]], and worked as Director of Cartographic Services at the [[University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh]] before "retirement" to raising children and writing atlases of [[fictional]] worlds.&lt;ref&gt;"About the Author", ''The Atlas of Pern'' back endpapers.&lt;/ref&gt; Pern was her second, following ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'' (Houghton-Mifflin, 1981) based on the fantasy fiction of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Her acknowledgments for ''The Atlas of Pern'' include "my husband, Todd, associate professor of geography", the UW Oshkosh Department of Geography, several UWO faculty members.&lt;ref&gt;"Acknowledgements", ''The Atlas of Pern'' front endpapers.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Continental Op''' is a [[fictional character]] created by [[Dashiell Hammett]]. He is a [[private investigator]] employed as an operative of the Continental Detective Agency's [[San Francisco]] office. The stories are all told in the first person and his name is never mentioned.

== Profile ==
The Continental Op is a master of deceit in the exercise of his occupation. In his 1927 ''[[Black Mask (magazine)|Black Mask]]'' story "$106,000 Blood Money" the Op is confronted with two dilemmas: shall he expose a corrupt fellow detective, thereby hurting the reputation of his agency; and shall he also allow an [[informant]] to collect the $106,000 reward in a big case even though he is morally certain—but cannot prove—that the informant has [[murder]]ed one of his agency's clients? The Op resolves his two problems neatly by manipulating events so that the corrupt detective and the informant get into an armed confrontation in which both are killed.

Decades of witnessing human cruelty, misery, and ruin, as well as being instrumental in sending hundreds of people to jail, or to the gallows, have greatly weakened the Op's natural sympathy with his fellow men. He fears becoming like his boss, "The Old Man", whom he describes as "a shell, without any human feelings whatsoever".

In the penultimate chapter of ''[[The Dain Curse]]'', a female client, whose life the Op has saved three times, while also curing her of [[morphine]] addiction, says to him:

{{quotation|
:"You came in just now, and then I saw—"
:She stopped.
:"What?"
:"A monster. A nice one, an especially nice one to have around when you're in trouble, but a monster just the same, without any human foolishness like love in him, and—What's the matter? Have I said something I shouldn't?"}}

The Op is one of the first major [[hardboiled]] detectives&lt;ref&gt;Race Williams, Three-Gun Terry, and the Continental Op all debuted in "Black Mask Magazine" in 1923.  http://www.thrillingdetective.com/race.html&lt;/ref&gt; later developed in such characters as Hammett's own [[Sam Spade]], [[Raymond Chandler]]'s [[Philip Marlowe]], [[Mickey Spillane|Mickey Spillane's]] [[Mike Hammer]], [[Ross Macdonald|Ross Macdonald's]] [[Lew Archer]] and others.

== Works ==
The Continental Op made his debut in an October 1923 issue of ''[[Black Mask (magazine)|Black Mask]]'', making him one of the earliest [[hard-boiled]] private detective characters to appear in the [[pulp magazine]]s of the early twentieth century. He appeared in 36 short stories, all but two of which appeared in ''Black Mask.''

In 1927, Hammett began writing linked stories, which formed the basis for his first two novels, ''[[Red Harvest]]'' and ''The Dain Curse'', both released in 1929. Two other stories, "The Big Knockover" and "$106,000 Blood Money" were published as ''Blood Money'' in 1943. Hammett also wrote a two-story sequence in the summer of 1924 consisting of "[[The House on Turk Street]]" and "The Girl with the Silver Eyes". These were recently published (along with ''The Dain Curse'', ''[[The Glass Key]]'', and ''Blood Money'') in a Modern Library edition, though they are not officially called a novel as was ''Blood Money''.

Of the 28 stories not a part of ''[[Red Harvest]]'' or ''The Dain Curse'', 26 are available in one of three collections from Vintage Crime, ''The Big Knockover'' (1966), ''The Continental Op'' (1974), and ''Nightmare Town'' (1999), and/or the Library of America collection ''Crime Stories and Other Writings'' (2001).

A number of collections of Hammett stories, both books collecting Continental Op stories (''The Continental Op'', ''The Return of the Continental Op'') and others with miscellaneous Hammett stories, were published as [[Dell Books|Dell]] [[mapback]]s. These collections all contained introductory essays by [[Ellery Queen]]. A more recent edition contains a short introduction by Columbia professor Steven Marcus.

'''United States Naval Ship''' or '''USNS''' is the [[ship prefix|prefix designation]] given to non-[[ship commissioning|commissioned]] ships that are property of the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/ |title=Joint Publication 1-02 Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms |work=Defense Technical Information Center |date=8 November 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
United States Naval Ships are unarmed [[auxiliary ship|auxiliary support vessels]] owned by the U.S. Navy and operated in non-commissioned service by [[Military Sealift Command]] with a civilian crew.  Some ships include a small military complement to carry out communication and special mission functions, or for force protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.msc.navy.mil/people/ |title=Military Sealift Command: People |work=Military Sealift Command |year=2014 |accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, U.S. Navy ships commissioned into service have the designation '''[[United States Ship|USS]]''' and are armed, crewed by U.S. Navy personnel, and held in property by the United States Government.&lt;ref Name="USNSN"&gt;{{cite web |title=USN Ship Naming |publisher=[[Naval History &amp; Heritage Command]] |date=29 September 1997 |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq63-1.htm |accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the United States Naval Ships [[hull classification symbol]] begins with "T-" to denote its civilian crew.  The USNS prefix can only be assigned while the ship is owned by the U.S. Navy.  If, after being taken out of service, the ship is transferred to the [[Maritime Administration]] the prefix reverts to a civilian [[ship prefix]] such as the case of [[USNS Comet (T-AK-269)|SS ''Comet'']].

'''WAGs''' (or '''Wags''') is an [[acronym]] used to refer to '''wives and girlfriends''' of high-profile [[sportspersons]]. The term may also be used in the singular form, '''WAG''', to refer to a specific female partner or life partner who is in a relationships with an athlete.

The term was first used by the British [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] press to refer to the wives and girlfriends of high-profile [[association football|footballers]], originally the [[England national football team]]. It came into common use during the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], although the term had been used occasionally before that. The acronym has since been used by the media in other countries to describe the female partners of [[sportsperson|sportspeople]] in general.

== Lexicography ==

It is popular belief that the first recorded use of the term WAG was in 2002: "It was never guaranteed that the wives and girlfriends (or "the Wags", as staff at the Jumeirah Beach Club call them for short) would get along. Mrs Beckham's tongue, for one thing, has previously run away with itself."&lt;ref name="Sunday Telegraph, 19 May 2002"&gt;''Sunday Telegraph'', 19 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 it was generally printed as "WAGs", but a singular, "Wag" or "WAG", quickly came into vogue for example: "any additional pounds she gained during Wag drinking sessions";&lt;ref&gt;''Metro'', 4 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; "a property heiress, model and actress, appears a likely sports WAG".&lt;ref name="Times, 3 July 2006"&gt;''Times'', 3 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susie Dent]]'s annual ''[[Language Report]]'' for the Oxford University Press (2006) capitalised the entire acronym as "WAG" ("'''w'''ife '''a'''nd/or '''g'''irlfriend") .&lt;ref&gt;Susie Dent (2006) ''The like, Language Report for real''&lt;/ref&gt;

"WAG"/"wag" came also to be used somewhat [[RAS syndrome|redundantly]] ("deluxe-edition Wag girlfriend"&lt;ref&gt;Rod Liddle, ''Sunday Times'', 13 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;), although in such usage "girlfriend" (or "wife") could be interpreted as further denotative specification within the set of people fitting both the denotation and the connotation of "WAG", and increasingly in non-footballing contexts: for example, the first wife of comedian [[Peter Cook]] (1937–95) was described as a "Sixties Wag"&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times News Review'', 24 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and actress [[Jennifer Ellison]], because of her former choice of clothes, "once ... the epitome of a Wag".&lt;ref&gt;Reference was made to Ellison's erstwhile "short skirt, high heels, long talons and hair extensions" and the tenuous fact that she had once stepped out briefly with Liverpool and England player Steven Gerrard: ''London Lite'', 5 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Fashion writer Shane Watson coined a [[collective noun]], "waggery".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 17 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; One can also be "Wagged"

This type of acronym is of long standing in British English. For example, during the Second World War, a series of [[County War Agricultural Executive Committees]] or CWAECs was known widely as "War Ags".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Smith (2011) ''The Spade as Mighty as the Sword''&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2006 World Cup ==
During the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] the press gave increasing coverage to the socialising and shopping activities of the English WAGs, who were based in the German town of [[Baden-Baden]]. It was frequently suggested that England's exit from the tournament in the quarterfinals was a result of such distractions.

Prominent WAGs of that year included [[Victoria Beckham]], wife of then England captain [[David Beckham]], whom the ''New Yorker'' described as "Queen of the Wags"&lt;ref&gt;''New Yorker'', 3 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Sunday Times'' as "the original Wag";&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times'', 20 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cheryl (singer)|Cheryl]], ''née'' Tweedy, of the group [[Girls Aloud]], who shortly afterwards married [[Ashley Cole]] ("Wag weds"&lt;ref&gt;Mirror'', 16 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;), from whom she was divorced in 2010; [[Coleen Rooney]], ''née'' Mcloughlin, who married [[Wayne Rooney]] in June 2008 and who was variously described as a "[[chav]]ette", by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' a "super WAG"&lt;ref&gt;''The Sun'', 6 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and, by the end of the year, listed by the ''Times'' as a "[[national treasure]]";&lt;ref&gt;''Times Magazine'', 23 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and fitness instructor [[Carly Cole]] née Zucker, wife of [[Joe Cole]], described by Susie Whally in the ''Sunday Times'' as a "new WAG on the block [who] has set the tone for the season's most wanted muscles".&lt;ref&gt;''Style'', 9 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Other WAGs that aroused considerable interest included [[Melanie Slade]], due to her relative youth – she was an [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] student at the time – girlfriend of [[Theo Walcott]], who, at seventeen, was himself the youngest member of the England squad; [[Abbey Clancy]], girlfriend of [[Peter Crouch]]; [[Steven Gerrard]]'s fiancé [[Alex Curran]], a model frequently featured in tabloids and fashion magazines; and former Spanish waitress [[Elen Rives]], the then fiancée of [[Frank Lampard]].

[[Nancy Dell'Olio]], an Italian property lawyer who was the girlfriend of the then England coach [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]], enjoyed quite a high public profile of her own, partly as a result of long-running press interest in aspects of Eriksson's private life.

== Notable ==
There are many celebrities who are also considered WAGs, by either marrying or dating a notable athlete. Some famous WAGs include [[La La Anthony]], [[Victoria Beckham]], [[Gisele Bündchen]], [[Cheryl (singer)|Cheryl]], [[Ciara]], [[Ayesha Curry]], [[Hilary Duff]], [[Savannah James]], [[Khloe Kardashian]], [[Carrie Underwood]] and [[Gabrielle Union]].

=== Political comparisons ===
The WAGs' activities did however provide a "benchmark" of sorts. A [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] member of the UK Parliament, [[Denis MacShane]], described the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party's]] summer [[ball (dance)|ball]] of 2006 (for which tickets cost £400) as "mak[ing] the WAGs of Baden Baden look like the [[Bloomsbury set]]",&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 8 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; a comparison with the [[Bohemian style|"Bohemian"]] artistic group of the early 20th century that grew up initially around sisters [[Vanessa Bell]] and [[Virginia Woolf]].

Leo Beckett, husband of British Foreign Secretary [[Margaret Beckett]] was described as the "political equivalent of a WAG" because of the extent to which he accompanied his wife on official business.&lt;ref&gt;Roland White, ''Sunday Times'', 23 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implications for fashion ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Coleen McLoughlin - Times Magazine.JPG|thumb|[[Coleen Rooney]] (''née'' Mcloughlin) modelling for [[Asda|George at Asda]]: ''Times Magazine'', 9 September 2006]] --&gt;

Fashion writers of 2006 identified certain consequences of what [[Lisa Armstrong]] described as "WAG fall-out"&lt;ref name="Times Magazine, 15 July 2006"&gt;''Times Magazine'', 15 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and Tina Gaudoin as "Waglash".&lt;ref&gt;''Times Magazine'', 5 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These were mostly the implications of "over-exposure" of certain styles: for example, that the [[Hermès]] "[[Birkin Bag|Birkin]]" bag had become less desirable as a result of being ''de rigueur'' among WAGs in Baden-Baden&lt;ref&gt;''Style'', 25 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (a development dubbed by Shane Watson as "baglash"&lt;ref&gt;''Style'', 6 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;); or that reaction to WAGs’ excessively coiffed hair and "vacant perfection" had perhaps been the "tipping point" for a revival of fashions of the 1980s, commended by Armstrong as "the last era of anti-slick".&lt;ref name="Times Magazine, 15 July 2006"/&gt;

Armstrong also assured readers who wished to perfect the elements of "[[Chic: A-L#Beach chic|beach chic]]" that the use of denture cleaner to whiten the tips of nails would not make them "look like a WAG",&lt;ref name="Times Magazine, 22 July 2006"&gt;''Times Magazine'', 22 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; while her colleague Sarah Vine offered advice on "buying some nice perfume that won't make you smell like a WAG on heat".&lt;ref name="Times Magazine, 22 July 2006"/&gt; When it was reported, in 2007, that [[Coleen Rooney]] would be launching a range of beauty products, ''London Lite'' coined the term, ''"eau de wag"'' and asked, "who, tell us, who really wants to smell like Coleen McLoughlin?"&lt;ref&gt;Clare Coleman, ''London Lite'', 14 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wannabes====
However, some women did aspire to the "WAG" look. Mrs Rooney noted that "apparently more and more women are getting into debt because they try to shop and party like a footballer's wife. If I heard of anyone doing that, I'd tell them to get a grip".&lt;ref&gt;''Closer'', quoted in ''Sunday Times'', 3 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sunday Times'' columnist [[India Knight]] observed, while waiting in an airport queue, that "it's as if a low-level wannabe footballer's wife vibe that is neither aesthetically pleasing nor edifying has become the norm ... I saw this phenomenon ''en masse''".&lt;ref name="Sunday Times, 3 September 2006"&gt;''Sunday Times'', 3 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Among other features, Knight identified "enough pink glitter to satisfy the [[girly girl|girliest]] of five-year-olds", massive handbags and huge designer sunglasses.

Reflecting on sunglasses as an accessory, ''Sunday Times Style'''s senior fashion writer Colin McDowell suggested that, whereas women had been sure that the poise of [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] (1929–94) and [[Audrey Hepburn]] (1929–93), style icons of the mid-20th century, had been due to their shading their eyes, "Wags ... far from using dark glasses to encourage others to leave them alone, treat them as a weapon to attract and excite the [[paparazzi]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Style'', 30 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antecedents ==
Interest in the partners of footballers dates back at least to the late 1950s when the long-serving England captain [[Billy Wright (footballer born 1924)|Billy Wright]] married the singer [[The Beverley Sisters|Joy Beverley]]. By the late 1960s, then-captain [[Bobby Moore]] (1941–93) and his first wife Tina had become regarded as a stylish and "golden" couple. During the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] in Mexico the England manager [[Sir Alf Ramsey]] (1920–99) expressed concern at the effects on the team's cohesion of the presence of the wives of four players,&lt;ref&gt;Tina Moore, Frances Bonetti (wife of Peter Bonetti), Judith, later Lady Hurst ([[Geoff Hurst]]) and Kathy Peters ([[Martin Peters]]).&lt;/ref&gt;  a view that seems to have been shared by some other members of the squad.&lt;ref name="Leo McKinstry 2006 Sir Alf"&gt;Leo McKinstry (2006) ''Sir Alf''&lt;/ref&gt;  England's quarter-final defeat by [[West Germany]] in that competition has been widely attributed to [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeping]] lapses by [[Peter Bonetti]], whose pre-match nerves were thought by many, including Ramsey himself, to have been accentuated by rumours circulating about the alleged behaviour of his wife Frances.&lt;ref name="Leo McKinstry 2006 Sir Alf"/&gt;  By contrast, during the 1966 World Cup, their wives drove themselves to Wembley and the FA booked them a single function room in the Royal Garden Hotel at Kensington.

Interest in such partnerships scaled new heights in the late 1990s and early 21st century with the marriage (in 1999) of [[David Beckham]] to singer [[Victoria Beckham|Victoria Adams]] ("Posh Spice") of the [[Spice Girls]]. The couple were widely known as "Posh and Becks" and every aspect of their relationship and nuance of dress were subjected to scrutiny in the press and other media. Victoria Beckham was quoted as saying that she and her husband had "so many wider interests ... fashion, make-up. I mean you think, yeah, football's great, and singing's great. But you've got to look at the bigger picture".&lt;ref&gt;[[Susie Dent]] (2003) ''The Language Report''&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Manchester United captain [[Roy Keane]] had lashed out at footballers' wives and girlfriends, as well as their lavish lifestyle, during their trophyless season in 2001–2002. Keane blamed United's loss of form on some of his teammates' fixation with wealth, claiming that they had "forgot about the game, lost the hunger that got you the Rolex, the cars, the mansion." Earlier in the season, Keane had publicly advocated the break-up of the Treble-winning team&lt;ref name="vieira"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article511049.ece |title=The top 10 Roy Keane battles |work=The Times |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309065831/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article511049.ece |archivedate=9 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as he believed the teammates who had played in United's victorious 1999 Champions League final no longer had the motivation to work as hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2005/11/19/sfnroy19.xml |title=Keane exits still raging at the dying of the light |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London  | first=Tim | last=Rich | date=19 November 2005 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/15/sports/EU-SPT-SOC-Keane-WAGS.php |title=Search – Global Edition – The New York Times |work=International Herald Tribune |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Keane became manager of [[Sunderland A.F.C]], he complained about the difficulty signing players to the city in northeast England, as their wives or girlfriends insisted they only move to teams based in London. He remarked "If someone doesn't want to come to Sunderland then all well and good," Keane said. "But if they don't want to come to Sunderland because their wife wants to go shopping in London, then it is a sad state of affairs. Unfortunately that is what is influencing a lot of footballers' decisions. Priorities have changed for footballers and they are being dictated to by their wives and girlfriends."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/15/football.britishidentity |title=Roy Keane sees red again with outburst about Wags and their shopping jaunts &amp;#124; UK news |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 15 August 2007|accessdate=7 July 2009  | first=Louise | last=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Footballers' Wives'' ===
[[File:Fw1DVD.jpg|thumb|''Footballers' Wives'', 2002 (DVD of ITV drama series)]]

It was widely assumed that perceptions of the lifestyle of [[Victoria Beckham]] influenced the ITV drama series ''[[Footballers' Wives]]'' (2002) and in particular the character of Chardonnay Lane-Pascoe (played by [[Susie Amy]]). The term "footballer's wife" came to be associated with a spouse leading a "high" life of socialising and shopping. Alf Ramsey, who thought the role of a footballer's wife essentially that of a housewife,&lt;ref&gt;"A footballer's wife needs to run the home completely so that he has no worries; give him the sort of food he likes ... and to work only for his good and the good of his career": Alf Ramsey, quoted in Leo McKinstry (2006) ''Sir Alf''.&lt;/ref&gt; had once observed that he "didn't know much about women and the only women I know are footballers' wives". However, as his biographer noted, this remark was made "at a time when the phrase 'footballers' wives' had yet to become the embodiment of predatory lust."&lt;ref name="Leo McKinstry 2006 Sir Alf"/&gt;

Broadly speaking "Footballer's wife" and "WAG" were synonymous, but the latter was more generic, while the former connoted someone who seemed particularly pampered, perhaps with some of the characteristics also of an "[[Essex girl]]".

During the 2005–6 season the actress [[Joanna Taylor]], wife of Fulham midfielder [[Danny Murphy (footballer born 1977)|Danny Murphy]], wrote a regular column for the ''Times'' whose title, "Footballer's Wife", was no doubt partially ironic.

== "Jamelia" categorisation ==
Undoubtedly the "WAG" image of shopping and clubbing, as portrayed in the press in 2006, tended to stick. This led some WAGs, such as [[Girls Aloud]] member [[Cheryl Cole]], to reject the eponym and to emphasise their credentials as career women in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;London ''Evening Standard'', 5 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The singer [[Jamelia]] (whose footballer boyfriend, [[Darren Byfield]], played for [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]], which failed to qualify for the 2006 World Cup) drew a distinction between, on the one hand, those WAGs, such as Victoria Beckham, who are "businesswoman", and Cole and Rooney, who "have a job", and, on the other, those who, in her view, had the wrong "priorities" and simply spent their boyfriends' money.&lt;ref&gt;, such as [[Alex Curran]]''Metro'', 13 July 2&lt;/ref&gt; This categorisation had some similarities both with Lisa Armstrong's comparison of supermodels with WAGs and with the suggested "WAG"/"footballers' wife" distinction. Indeed, it is possible to argue that, over the two-month period of 2006 that the WAGs were in the public spotlight, a subtle distinction emerged between "WAG" as a general acronym and the increasingly used "Wag" in the colloquial sense of a "footballer's wife".

==''WAGs Boutique''==
In January 2007 a "reality" television series called ''[[WAGs Boutique]]'' ([[ITV2]]) was launched. This featured two teams of WAGs (few of whom had been among the party in Baden Baden the previous year) who competed to run fashion boutiques over a period of three months. The separation of one of the contenders, [[Michaela Henderson-Thynne]], from her erstwhile partner, [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] midfielder [[Stewart Downing]], raised some issues of principle and terminology. [[Giles Smith]] in the ''Times'' enquired whether "one can still be registered as a WAG after one has separated from one's footballer?"&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 1 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith noted also that a former beauty queen and controversial ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' contestant, [[Danielle Lloyd]], whose relationship with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]'s [[Teddy Sheringham]] was "less than concrete", was referred to, during a guest appearance on ''WAGs Boutique'', as "an on-off WAG". Smith wondered whether, in those moments when a woman was an "off-WAG", she was really a WAG at all.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 1 March 2007. ''Celebrity Big Brother'' was a "reality" game show on [[Channel 4]] television. In a series early in 2007 Daneille Lloyd, together with another contestant, [[Jade Goody]], had affronted some viewers with the language she used towards the eventual winner, the [[Bollywood]] actress [[Shilpa Shetty]].&lt;/ref&gt;  ''London Lite'' referred to Henderson-Thynne and [[Cassie Sumner]], a ''WAGs Boutique'' participant whose supposed relationship with [[Michael Essien]] was the subject of some doubt, as "fake WAGs".&lt;ref&gt;''London Lite'', 16 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-offs==

=== ''Les Wags'' and ''die WAGs'' ===
[[File:Girl Aloud 2.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Cheryl (entertainer)|Cheryl Cole]] (''née'' Tweedy), singer with [[Girls Aloud]]]]
As if to emphasise the perceptive opinion of former England full-back [[Jimmy Armfield]] that there was "a real international flavour to this World Cup",&lt;ref&gt;BBC Radio 5 Live, quoted in ''Private Eye'', 23 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Sunday Times'' published during the 2006 tournament a photograph of the wives of French players [[Thierry Henry]] and [[David Trézéguet]] with the caption "French Wags Nicole Henry and Beatrice Trezeguet share a smacker [''i.e.'' kiss]".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times'', 9 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

For its part, the French press referred to the English wives and girlfriends (''"les épouses et petites amies des joueurs"'') as ''"les Wags"'': ''"Et lorsque les Wags ont fini leur shopping ..."'' [And when the Wags had finished their shopping].&lt;ref&gt;''Le Monde'', 26 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in German, ''"die WAGs"'' was adopted. Austria's ''Seitenblicke'', for example, carried a story ''"Ich bin keine WAG!"'' in German about Cheryl Cole's apparent disclaiming of the appellation of "WAG": ''"Ich war bei 'Girls Aloud' bevor ich Ashley [Cole] kennenlernte ..."'' [I was with Girls Aloud before I met Ashley].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.seitenblicke.at/stars/starstories/artikel/4833/detail | title = Nennt mich ja nicht WAG! | coauthors = | date = 6 July 2006 | language=de | accessdate =2 February 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060715110505/http://www.seitenblicke.at/stars/starstories/artikel/4833/detail | archivedate = 15 July 2006 | quote = Es nerve sie extrem, wenn die Leute sie als Fußballer-Frau bezeichnen, so Tweedy.

=== Father of the girlfriend of a footballer ===
When the father of Melanie Slade ([[Theo Walcott]]'s girlfriend), Councillor John Slade, was installed as Mayor of [[Southampton]], Hampshire on 17 May 2006, he was introduced by a fellow councillor, Alec Samuels, as "about the most famous mayor this city has had in 790 years ... He is the father of the girlfriend of a footballer".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.24dash.com/content/news/viewNews.php?navID=2&amp;newsID=5873 | title = New Southampton mayor sworn in – as Mel Slade's dad | publisher = 24dash.com | date = 17 May 2006 | first = Jon | last = Land | accessdate =7 July 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231524/http://www.24dash.com/content/news/viewNews.php?navID=2&amp;newsID=5873 | archivedate = 26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LA WAGs===
When it was announced in 2007 that David Beckham would be joining the American club [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], the ''Mail on Sunday'' referred to the "LA WAGs whose husbands earn less in ten years than Beckham in one week". The ''Mail'' claimed that these WAGs, who included actress [[Bianca Kajlich]], married to Beckham teammate [[Landon Donovan]], were "stay-at-home girls" who "possess not a [[Chloé]] dress, a [[Prada]] handbag or a [[Manolo Blahnik]] shoe between them. And they are awaiting the arrival of Victoria Beckham with some trepidation".&lt;ref&gt;''Mail on Sunday'', 14 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-footballing WAGs===

====Lawn tennis====
During the course of the World Cup, the ''Times'' coined the term "WWAGs" ("[[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] Wives and Girlfriends") for the girlfriends of male participants in the All-England Lawn Tennis Championships in 2006.&lt;ref name="Times, 3 July 2006"/&gt; The most photographed WWAG in the British press during the tournament of 2006 was Kim Sears, the girlfriend of Scottish player [[Andy Murray]]. Sears is the daughter of Nigel Sears, former coach of the Slovak player [[Daniela Hantuchová]].

''The Sun'' used an alternative form, "WOWs" ("Wives of Wimbledon"), to draw attention to photographs of such "girls with WOW factor" as the Australian actress, [[Bec Hewitt]], ''née'' Cartwright, wife of [[Lleyton Hewitt]], Wimbledon champion in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Wheeler |first=Virginia |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006300613,00.html |title=Murray out of Wimbledon &amp;#124; The Sun &amp;#124;News |publisher=The Sun |date=4 July 2006 |accessdate=7 July 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Golf====
Interest in the private lives of golfers has been popular in the tabloids since the relationships of [[Nick Faldo]] and [[Tony Jacklin]], though not to the extent of footballers. Jacklin, who was then widowed at the time in 1988 had a date with a teenage girl, who then sold the story to ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspapers. Faldo is best remembered in the frontpage outside of sports, in 1998, having his [[Porsche 959]] trashed by an ex-girlfriend with his golf clubs. More recently, the marriage of [[Tiger Woods]] and [[Elin Nordegren]] received substantial media coverage; their marriage ended after even more widely publicised revelations of [[Tiger Woods#Infidelity scandal and fallout|Woods' serial infidelity]].

The term "wives and girlfriends" (in unabbreviated term) was commonly used during the [[Ryder Cup]] golfing competitions at [[The Belfry]] in [[2002 Ryder Cup|2002]] and [[Oakland Hills Country Club|Oakland Hills]] near Detroit in [[2004 Ryder Cup|2004]], the press having given these partners about as much coverage as the golfers themselves, due to the patriotic competitive nature of the sport which extends to themselves. ''[[London Lite]]''&lt;ref&gt;''London Lite'', 19 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Metro'', 20 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; used the slightly patronising acronym "WABs" ("wives and birdies", the latter a pun on the term for a one under [[par (score)|par]] score for a hole) with reference to the partners of the European team as they arrived in Ireland for the [[2006 Ryder Cup]] at [[The Kildare Hotel and Golf Club|The K Club]], Straffan, County Kildare.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Jessica Taylor the CWAG.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Jessica Taylor (Liberty X)|Jessica Taylor]] the "CWAG" - headline in ''London Lite'', 27 November 2006]] --&gt;

====Cricket====
"CWAGs" (Cricket Wives and Girlfriends) was applied to partners of the England [[cricket]] team in the series of [[Test cricket|test matches]] against Australia that began in [[Brisbane]], Queensland in November 2006: for example, "Jessica the Cwag knocks [[The Ashes|Ashes]] Test crowd for six"&lt;ref&gt;''London Lite'', 27 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (the subject of this headline being singer [[Jessica Taylor (Liberty X)|Jessica Taylor]], of the group [[Liberty X]], fiancée of batsman and occasional [[off-spin]]ner [[Kevin Pietersen]]). Although "CWAG" (rather than "WAG") was not used all that widely, there were predictable claims after England had lost the series 5–0 that the presence of wives and girlfriends had undermined the cohesion of the touring party.&lt;ref&gt;''Mail on Sunday'', 7 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; "WAG" had previously been applied in the context of cricket: for example to model [[Minki van der Westhuizen]], who had been associated with the South African captain, [[Graeme Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cricket.mailliw.com/archives/2006/11/01/slinki-minki-the-fans-favourite-wag/ |title=Slinky Minki the fans’ favourite WAG &amp;#124; The Corridor (a cricket blog) |publisher=Cricket.mailliw.com |accessdate=7 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627174214/http://www.cricket.mailliw.com/archives/2006/11/01/slinki-minki-the-fans-favourite-wag/ |archivedate=27 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the Australian media has started to use the "WAG" term to describe the partners of [[Australian cricket team|their own cricket team]]. See [[Australian Cricket WAGs]].

====British Royal Family====
In July 2006 ''The Sun'' carried an article on the "RAGs" ("Royals and Girlfriends"), a term introduced for young female members of the British Royal Family, as well as [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Kate Middleton]], then girlfriend and now [[Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton|wife]] of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]], and [[Chelsy Davy]], then girlfriend of [[Prince Harry]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Sun'', 3 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Others identified as "RAGs" were [[Princess Beatrice of York|Princess Beatrice]], [[Princess Eugenie of York|Princess Eugenie]], champion equestrian [[eventing|eventer]] [[Zara Phillips]], and [[Lady Gabriella Windsor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2001290023-2006300524_1,00.html |title=The Best for News, Sport, Showbiz, Celebrities &amp; TV |publisher=The Sun |accessdate=7 July 2009 |location=London }} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, under the heading "Windsor Mads outdo the Wags", Jasper Gerard reported in the ''Sunday Times'' on festivities involving "the Windsor Mads (mothers and daughters), as [[Sarah, Duchess of York|Fergie]] [Sarah, Duchess of York] and Eugenie celebrated Beatrice's forthcoming 18th birthday".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times'', 16 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Motor racing====
Though the term has never been used, many high-profile sportsmen in motor racing have publicly enjoyed high-profile relationships with celebrities, for instance [[Jacques Villeneuve]]'s relationship with [[Dannii Minogue]] and the former marriage of [[Dario Franchitti]] and [[Ashley Judd]].

One example of a well known wife of a sportsman is Michaela Fogarty, the wife of former [[Superbike World Championship]] star [[Carl Fogarty|Carl]]. At the height of her husband's fame, she has been photographed in pit and paddock areas and has also appeared in print advertisements for [[Ducati]] motorcycles, which her husband has ridden for. Despite never appearing in the spotlight, much of her popularity is within the motorcycling fraternity, as she is known for her support of her husband. The two have even appeared in a series which they embark on an adventure riding.

====Rugby League====
Many partners of [[Rugby League]] players are increasingly being associated with the WAGs term by the media. Examples include [[Terry Biviano]], [[Candice Falzon]] and [[Lauryn Eagle]]

====Rugby Union====
Many partners of [[Rugby Union]] players are increasingly being associated with the WAGs term by the media. Examples include [[The Saturdays]] singer [[Una Healy]] who is married to English rugby player [[Ben Foden]] and actress [[Susie Amy]] who is in a relationship with Irish rugby player [[Rob Kearney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2035879/Meet-Rugby-World-Cup-WAGS-theyre-just-pretty-faces.html|title=Meet the Rugby World Cup WAGs (but they're not just pretty faces)|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=26 December 2013|location=London|first=Alanah|last=Eriksen|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] and grandchild of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] [[Zara Phillips]] has been labelled a WAG for her marriage to English [[centre (rugby union)|centre]] [[Mike Tindall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2292666/Cheltenham-Festival-2013-Zara-rugby-WAGs-enjoy-giggly-Ladies-Day.html|title=Zara and rugby WAGs enjoy a giggly Ladies' Day at Cheltenham|work=Daily mail|accessdate=26 December 2013|location=London|first=Louise|last=Eccles|date=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shinty====

The traditional Scottish sport of [[shinty]] has developed the terminology "SWAGs" to refer to the wives and partners of shinty players. The terms was given further credence by an hour long documentary on [[BBC Alba]], following various partners throughout a shinty season.[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03m7826]  Some of the "SWAGs" featured in the programme have been given further prominence in print [http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/real-life/tv-show-follows-life-touchline-2648890] and at shinty events.[http://www.skyecamanachd.com/news/SWAGs-To-Make-2014-Shinty-Cup-Draws.htm]

==== ''Private Eye'' ====
In an irreverent parody – "Those World Cup Acronyms in Full" – the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' (which had, among other things, imagined a table-top game, with a [[Gucci]] ball, called "[[Subbuteo]] Footballers' Wives" and referred to Coleen (McLoughlin) Rooney as "Noleen McCleavage"&lt;ref&gt;''The Private Eye Annual 2006'' (ed [[Ian Hislop]])&lt;/ref&gt;) offered such additional terms as "SHAGS" ("unofficial girlfriends whose numbers appear on footballers' mobile phones") and "GAGS" ("Writs served by footballers accused of relationships with SHAGS").&lt;ref&gt;''Private Eye'', 7 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these were allusions to rumours two years earlier about the private life of an England international player.

Following the weddings of four England players in a single weekend in 2007, the ''Eye'''s "[[Glenda Slagg]]" column referred jokingly to "SLAGS": "that's 'Stupid Lazy and Grasping Slappers' – Geddit?!?".&lt;ref&gt;''Private Eye'', 22 June – 5 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In an October 2008 press conference, England and Manchester United footballer [[Rio Ferdinand]] heavily criticised the WAGS culture, particularly in Baden-Baden two years previously, calling it a "circus" and giving praise to new England manager [[Fabio Capello]]'s more disciplined regime,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/internationals/wags-circus-era-ridiculed-by-ferdinand-961253.html |title='WAGs circus' era ridiculed by Ferdinand – International, Football |work=The Independent |location=London |date=15 October 2008 |accessdate=7 July 2009  | first=Jason | last=Burt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after England had qualified for the [[2010 World Cup]] by beating [[Croatia]] 5–1, Capello made his first public comment on the WAGs by making it clear that the England players will only be able to see their wives and partners the day after a match, stating that "We are there to play, not for a holiday".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/internationals/capello-leave-the-wags-at-home-this-time.1785298.html |title=Capello-Leave the WAGs at home this time – International, Football |work=The Independent |location=London |date=11 September 2009 |accessdate=12 September 2009  | first=Sam | last=Wallace}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it happened, the England team were knocked out of that tournament at an even earlier stage.

==In popular culture==
In the [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]] song "[[American Boy (Estelle song)|American Boy]]", [[Kanye West]] [[rap music|rap]]s the lyrics; "But I still talk that ca-a-sh, Cuz a lotta WAGS wanna hear it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/a81326/kanye-west-to-rap-about-wags-on-new-song.html |title=Kanye West to rap about WAGs on new song |work=Digital Spy |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two novels have been published about WAGs. The first, ''A Wag's Diary'', was released in October 2007, published by Harper Collins; the second, ''A Wag's Diary in LA'', was published in June 2008. Both books are written by [[Alison Kervin]].

A 2015 American [[reality television]] series titled ''[[WAGS (TV series)|WAGS]]'' aired on the [[E!|E! network]], featuring both the professional and personal lives of several WAGs. Two spin-off series, ''[[WAGS Miami]]'' and ''[[WAGS Atlanta]]'', were also produced, focusing on WAGs in [[Miami]] and [[Atlanta]], respectively. [[VH1]]'s ''[[Basketball Wives]]'' and its various spin-offs have also featured the concept, instead involving the significant others of [[professional basketball]] players.

'''''Wandt v. Hearst's Chicago American''''' (1906) 129 Wis. 419, 109 NW 70 

The ''[[Chicago American]]'' ran a picture next to an article about a person who repeatedly attempted to [[commit suicide]]. Although it wasn't explicit that the picture was of that person, the location of the picture next to that article created a false association that constituted [[libel]]. This case is authority that: where a person's picture is taken by a [[photographer]], there is a breach of an [[implied contract]] or relationship of [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] when the photographer makes additional pictures and uses them for commercial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;http://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4161&amp;context=mulr&lt;/ref&gt;
