}}

In July 2017 the municipalities of [[Mahwah, New Jersey|Mahwah]], [[Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|Upper Saddle River]] and [[Montvale, New Jersey|Montvale]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]], in the United States, opposed extension of an [[eruv]] within their borders. An eruv is a land area surrounded by a boundary of religious significance, often marked by small plastic pipes (called ''lechis'') attached to [[utility pole]]s. The demarcation permits [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Jews to push or carry objects (such as prayer books, keys or baby strollers) within the eruv on the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]], in a way that is otherwise considered forbidden under Orthodox Jewish law. Other [[Jewish_religious_movements#Modern_movements_or_denominations|Jewish denominations]], such as [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] or [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], do not hold such views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/living/eruv_1.shtml |title=Eruvs |date=July 23, 2009 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailynews.com/2007/01/29/eruv-in-oak-park-splits-community/ |title=Eruv in Oak Park Splits Community |date=January 29, 2007 |publisher=Los Angeles Daily News |accessdate=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three municipalities ordered that the borders of the eruv be dismantled having been erected without the appropriate consents. Many Mahwah residents angrily protested against the prospect of Orthodox Jews from [[Rockland County, New York]], using local parks or seeking to buy homes there.

After no agreement could be reached short of litigation, the eruv association brought suit against each of the municipalities. Mahwah's actions in passing a [[local ordinance|township ordinance]] to bar nonresidents of New Jersey from its parks, and the hostility of some residents and council members towards those who supported the eruv led Democratic candidate for [[Governor of New Jersey]] [[Phil Murphy]] and others to make accusations of anti-Semitism. The presiding judge in the lawsuits, [[John Michael Vazquez]], in January 2018 made it clear he felt the municipalities did not have a strong case, and urged them to settle. The three municipalities have settled with the eruv association, allowing the eruv borders to remain. Mahwah has settled a lawsuit from the [[New Jersey Attorney General]] accusing it of discrimination.

==Background==
[[File:Bergen County, NJ municipalities labeled.svg|thumb|upright|Bergen County, New Jersey. Mahwah is the large area at upper left (northwest), with Upper Saddle River and Montvale the next to the east along the state line (at top).]]
[[File:Location map of Bergen County, New Jersey.svg|thumb|upright|Location map of Bergen County in New Jersey. Rockland County in New York is seen, in part, to the north.]]
The [[Township (New Jersey)|township]] of [[Mahwah, New Jersey|Mahwah]], and the [[borough (New Jersey)|boroughs]] of [[Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|Upper Saddle River]] and [[Montvale, New Jersey|Montvale]], are neighboring municipalities in northwestern [[Bergen County, New Jersey]]. All three are adjacent to the state line with New York,&lt;ref name="have a talk"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mahwah mayor wants to talk with eruv association |url = http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/mahwah-mayor-wants-to-talk-with-eruv-association/ |accessdate = February 11, 2018 |date = July 25, 2017 |last = Yudelson |first = Larry |newspaper = The Jewish Standard |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180212005506/http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/mahwah-mayor-wants-to-talk-with-eruv-association/ |archivedate = February 12, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the other side of which is [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]], where there are large communities of [[Orthodox Jew]]s.&lt;ref name = "prepare" /&gt;

An [[eruv]] (plural "eruvin", or sometimes "eruvim") is an enclosure defined by string, rope, wires, cables, etc., that allows observant Jews, including the Orthodox, to carry or push objects further than is normally permitted on [[Shabbat|the Jewish Sabbath]] (or Shabbat). Normally, on Shabbat, an object may not be taken from a private domain, such as a house, into a public one, such as a street or sidewalk, or moved, in a public area, more than 4 [[cubit]]s (about 6 feet; 1.7 meters). Note that "domain" is a technical term referring to how enclosed an area is, not property ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabadwmc.com/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/2270313/jewish/About-Eruv.htm |title=About Eruv |publisher=Chabad of West Monmouth County |access-date=July 27, 2018 |quote=Private and public do not refer to ownership. An enclosed area is considered a private domain, whereas an open area is considered public for the purposes of these laws.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objects may be moved freely if they remain within a private domain, and an eruv effectively extends the private domain through the area it encloses, including streets and sidewalks. The boundary of an eruv is often marked by utility poles surrounding a given area, with the space between regarded as doorways, topped by lintels, the telephone or power wires.&lt;ref name="whatisaneruv"&gt;{{cite web |last = Lozovsky |first = Lorne |url = http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/700456/jewish/What-Is-an-Eruv.htm |title = What is an Eruv? |publisher = chabad.org |accessdate = February 7, 2018 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180208024846/http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/700456/jewish/What-Is-an-Eruv.htm |archivedate = February 8, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The poles are regarded as doorposts, and are marked by lechis (singular: lechi), solid objects such as lengths of twine or of plastic pipe, which run from near the ground to just below the wires.&lt;ref name="eruvglossary"&gt;{{cite web |title = Eruv Glossary |publisher = Greater Boston Eruv Corporation |url = http://www.bostoneruv.org/glossary.htm |accessdate = February 7, 2018 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180319011458/http://www.bostoneruv.org/glossary.htm |archivedate = March 19, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the act of stringing such a boundary around a public area by a Jewish community creates the pretense for its members that that public area is enclosed for the limited purpose of allowing the members to do some otherwise forbidden things in that public area on the Sabbath.

There are many requirements for eruvin; the [[Talmud]] devotes [[Eruvin (Talmud)|an entire tractate]] to the subject. This complexity makes [[Rabbi#Functions|rabbinic supervision]] and regular inspection mandatory. An operating eruv allows observant Jews to carry prayer books from home to synagogue on Shabbat, or to push strollers or baby carriages.&lt;ref name="whatisaneruv" /&gt;

[[File:Eruv segment.jpg|thumb|left|An eruv boundary, Airmont, New York. Note the white plastic lechi at right of nearest pole.]]
In [[Teaneck, New Jersey|Teaneck]], in southeastern Bergen County and home to large numbers of Orthodox Jews, an eruv has existed since the 1970s with little controversy, and, as the Jewish population increased, was extended to nearby [[Bogota, New Jersey|Bogota]] and [[Bergenfield, New Jersey|Bergenfield]]. Other eruvin in Bergen County are in [[Fair Lawn, New Jersey|Fair Lawn]] and in [[Paramus, New Jersey|Paramus]].&lt;ref name="prepare"&gt;{{cite news |title = Jewish group prepares for legal fight over religious boundary |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/2017/07/27/jewish-group-prepares-legal-fight-over-religious-boundary/512083001/ |accessdate = February 7, 2018 |date = July 27, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |last2 = Burrow |first2 = Megan |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170910121250/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/2017/07/27/jewish-group-prepares-legal-fight-over-religious-boundary/512083001/ |archivedate = September 10, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A previous instance in which an eruv had been constructed in Bergen County, and had been challenged by local authorities, occurred in [[Tenafly, New Jersey|Tenafly]], in the eastern part of the county. Attempts by municipal authorities to ban eruvin had failed when challenged in the federal courts, and the settlement in 2006 after a six-year battle obliged the borough to pay $325,000 for the eruv association's legal costs.&lt;ref name = "prepare" /&gt; In some cases involving conflict over whether an eruv should be permitted, the municipality has lost and the construction of the eruv allowed to continue.&lt;ref name="three towns"&gt;{{cite news |title = Three North Jersey towns face lawsuits over alleged Orthodox Jewish discrimination |url = http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2017/10/three_north_jersey_towns_face_lawsuits_over_alleged_orthodox_jewish_discrimination.html |accessdate = April 10, 2018 |date = October 29, 2017 |last = Banco |first = Erin |work = NJ.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180213081351/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2017/10/three_north_jersey_towns_face_lawsuits_over_alleged_orthodox_jewish_discrimination.html |archivedate = February 13, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and controversy==
[[File:Lechi Mahwah.jpg|thumb|upright|Portion of a lechi attached to a utility pole, Mahwah, New Jersey]]
Orthodox Jews in Rockland County gained a license from [[Orange and Rockland Utilities]] (which serves parts of both Rockland County in New York and Bergen County in New Jersey) to construct an eruv using its utility poles in 2015,&lt;ref name = "Montvale" /&gt; and in March 2017 the company granted permission for the South [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]] Eruv Fund to install lechis, made from white [[PVC]] pipe, on its utility poles in northwestern Bergen County.&lt;ref name="engineer"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mahwah engineer orders Jewish group to take down religious boundary |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/22/mahwah-engineer-orders-jewish-group-take-down-religious-boundary/501336001/ |accessdate = February 8, 2018 |date = July 22, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170909173825/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/22/mahwah-engineer-orders-jewish-group-take-down-religious-boundary/501336001/ |archivedate = September 9, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an extension of an existing eruv in Rockland County, and was intended to run through Mahwah, Upper Saddle River and Montvale.&lt;ref name = "construction" /&gt; According to Rabbi Chaim Steinmetz, head of the eruv association, the purpose was to accommodate those living in Rockland County close to the border, near [[New York State Route 59]].&lt;ref name = "prepare" /&gt; The boundaries had to be run through New Jersey due to the lack of a road along the state line.&lt;ref name = "eruv live" /&gt; Mahwah police noted construction being done on utility poles in May and made inquiries. On learning that Orange and Rockland had authorized the work, they provided police protection, for which the department was paid about $2,000 by the eruv fund. The work in Mahwah was complete by June.&lt;ref name="construction"&gt;{{cite news |title = Attorney: Mahwah PD supervised eruv installation |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/28/attorney-mahwah-pd-supervised-eruv-installation/521157001/ |accessdate = February 8, 2018 |date = July 22, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170904200615/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/28/attorney-mahwah-pd-supervised-eruv-installation/521157001/ |archivedate = September 4, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the matter became generally known in mid-July, there was what local reporter Tom Nobile called a "firestorm of opposition" from local residents, with some expressing concerns that the eruv would allow Orthodox communities in Rockland County to expand into New Jersey.&lt;ref name = "construction"/&gt; Groups formed on [[social media]], including one named Mahwah Strong, in opposition to the eruv.&lt;ref name="Mahwah residents"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mahwah residents voice opposition, support for eruv |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/28/mahwah-residents-voice-opposition-support-eruv/518944001/ |accessdate = February 8, 2018 |date = July 28, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170912230307/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/28/mahwah-residents-voice-opposition-support-eruv/518944001/ |archivedate = September 12, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahwah Strong claimed 3,000 members within days; a founder, Robert Ferguson, stated that his group would act as a check and balance to ensure the township enforced its laws, and noted, "I don't view this as a hostile takeover of the town."&lt;ref name = "200 people"/&gt; Two hundred people gathered in a Mahwah park on July 22 to support the eruv's removal. An online petition to "Protect the Quality of Our Community in Mahwah", initiated by former township council member John Roth, reached 1,200 names before being taken down due to what Roth called inappropriate comments, made by some signers.&lt;ref name="200 people"&gt;{{cite news |title = 200 people meet to support removal of Mahwah eruv |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2017/07/25/200-people-gather-support-mahwahs-removal-eruv/506836001/ |accessdate = February 8, 2018 |date = July 25, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180213195157/https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2017/07/25/200-people-gather-support-mahwahs-removal-eruv/506836001/ |archivedate = February 13, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Mahwah Strong lost its [[Facebook]] page following an influx of comments deemed "hateful".&lt;ref name="Facebook page"/&gt;

==Municipal and public reaction==
[[File:Sam Braen Field.jpg|thumb|Mahwah tried to ban out-of-staters from its parks. Airmount Park shown; seen in 2018.]]

This was done prior to construction with the result that the eruv did not extend into Montvale.&lt;ref name = "200 people" /&gt; On July 18, Upper Saddle River's attorney sent a letter demanding the removal of the lechis that had been erected there,&lt;ref name="yeshiva"&gt;{{cite news |title = Orthodox Jewish community and Mahwah residents at war over orders to remove the eruv |url = https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/general/1325047/mahwah-nj-orders-removal-jewish-communitys-eruv.html |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = July 25, 2017 |newspaper = The Yeshiva World |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180214014517/https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/general/1325047/mahwah-nj-orders-removal-jewish-communitys-eruv.html |archivedate = February 14, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a deadline of July 26, but the borough agreed to let them remain for the time being after two New York State residents filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey]] in Newark, requesting a [[temporary restraining order]] against the borough and Mayor Joanne Minichetti. The borough's agreement was in exchange for an undertaking from the eruv association not to expand the eruv, and the motion for a restraining order was withdrawn. The eruv was vandalized on July 26 and 27, requiring immediate repair work.&lt;ref name="usr"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.usrtoday.org/2017/10/11/update-on-eruv-litigation |title = Update on eruv litigation |date = October 11, 2017 |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |publisher = Borough of [[Upper Saddle River, New Jersey]] |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180319011519/https://www.usrtoday.org/2017/10/11/update-on-eruv-litigation/ |archivedate = March 19, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="restraining"&gt;{{cite news |title = Plaintiffs withdraw request for restraining order in eruv dispute |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/upper-saddle-river/2017/07/29/restraining-order-sought-prevent-removal-eruv/521982001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = July 29, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170903130516/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/upper-saddle-river/2017/07/29/restraining-order-sought-prevent-removal-eruv/521982001/ |archivedate = September 3, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahwah's township engineer, Mike Kelly, sent a letter to the eruv association on July 21, taking a stance similar to Montvale's, and demanding the removal of the eruv by August 4. Mayor  Bill Laforet stated, "This sends a very strong message to those who choose to violate our sign ordinances."&lt;ref name = "yeshiva" /&gt;

On June 29, the Mahwah Township Council had passed an ordinance, effective July 27, barring nonresidents of New Jersey from its parks. Residents had complained that out-of-staters were flooding Mahwah's parks, sometimes by the busload. After the ordinance passed, but before it went into effect, Mahwah police chief James Batelli received many phone calls from residents asking that it be enforced against Orthodox Jews. He contacted the Bergen County Prosecutor, [[Gurbir Grewal]], for advice. On July 27, the date the ordinance was to go into effect, Grewal issued a directive ordering Mahwah police to disregard the ban, stating that the ban could lead to racial profiling, unlawful searches and seizures and the illegal targeting of Orthodox Jews.&lt;ref name="nj parks"&gt;{{cite news |title = Prosecutor: Mahwah park ban could illegally target Jews |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/28/prosecutor-mahwah-park-ban-could-illegally-target-jews/517984001/ |first = Svetlana |last = Shkolnikova |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = July 28, 2017 |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170913021311/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/mahwah/2017/07/28/prosecutor-mahwah-park-ban-could-illegally-target-jews/517984001/ |archivedate = September 13, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Rob Hermansen, president of the township council, stated that that body would rework the ordinance to continue putting Mahwah residents first.&lt;ref name="prosecutor"&gt;{{cite news |title = Prosecutor tells NJ police to ignore rule that may target Jews |url = http://pix11.com/2017/07/28/prosecutor-tells-nj-police-to-ignore-rule-that-may-target-jews/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = July 28, 2017 |publisher = WPIX-TV |agency = Associated Press |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171223075638/http://pix11.com/2017/07/28/prosecutor-tells-nj-police-to-ignore-rule-that-may-target-jews/ |archivedate = December 23, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Mahwah Township Council met on the evening of July 27, it did so before an overflow crowd. Despite warnings from the township attorney not to discuss issues of religion, some did. Others complained of nonresidents crowding parks, and that they had been visited by people wanting to buy their homes. The lawyer for Mahwah Strong urged the council to enforce the law by requiring the takedown of the eruv.&lt;ref name="Mahwah residents"/&gt; Ferguson was quoted as saying at the meeting, "We do not not want these people living in our neighborhoods. We want them following the law."&lt;ref name = "have a talk" /&gt;

As the eruv controversy intensified, Mahwah and Montvale, as well as neighboring boroughs, enacted or made stricter ordinances restricting those making unsolicited offers to buy houses from knocking on doors. Municipal officials stated that this was being done because of the concerns of residents, who feared the Orthodox moving in would result in a population explosion, that the schools would suffer, and high-density housing built.

To a standing ovation from some 200 residents in attendance, the Mahwah council on August 10 unanimously voted to issue [[summons]]es because the eruv had not been taken down. Mayor Laforet, though, urged the council not to take this step, pointing to the large expense the unsuccessful eruv litigation had cost Tenafly, and advocated negotiation. In response to the council's action, the Bergen-Rockland Eruv Association (of which the South Monsey group is a part) and several Orthodox Jews resident in Rockland County filed suit in federal court against Mahwah on August 11, and promised to defy any summonses.&lt;ref name="need to know"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2017/08/heres_what_you_need_to_know_about_the_eruv_dispute.html |title = Here's what you need to know about the eruv dispute brewing in North Jersey |accessdate = February 11, 2018 |date = August 11, 2017 |last = Jerde |first = Sara |work = NJ.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170914185253/http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2017/08/heres_what_you_need_to_know_about_the_eruv_dispute.html |archivedate = September 14, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "mahwah lawsuit"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/upper-saddle-river/2017/09/15/n-y-group-sues-expand-eruv-upper-saddle-river/670790001/ |title = Orthodox Jewish group sues Mahwah over plan to issue eruv summonses |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = August 11, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |first2 = Svetlana |last2 = Shkolnikova |work = NorthJersey.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents of Teaneck and [[Englewood, New Jersey|Englewood]], each in southeastern Bergen County and home to large communities of Orthodox Jews, had gone to Mahwah and Upper Saddle River to make known their views at council meetings.

Citizens for a Better Upper Saddle River posted a screenshot of the Teaneck council schedule online, urging members to mark their calendars with the dates.

==Litigation==
Following failed settlement negotiations and a closed-door council meeting on October 10, the Bergen-Rockland Eruv Association and individual plaintiffs sued Montvale on October 18, alleging that Mayor Ghassali's stop work order inhibited them in practicing their religion. They cited a 2015 statement from then-mayor Roger Fyfe, from when rumors of an eruv had first circulated, that an eruv was a simple accommodation and a matter in which the borough had only a slight part. The plaintiffs also alleged that Mahwah and Upper Saddle River were aware of the eruv construction, but had no problem with it until they gave in to a campaign of xenophobia and anti-Semitism.&lt;ref name="Montvale"&gt;{{cite news |title = Montvale sued for blocking eruv expansion |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/10/20/montvale-sued-blocking-eruv-expansion/781025001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = October 20, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171020223732/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/10/20/montvale-sued-blocking-eruv-expansion/781025001/ |archivedate = October 20, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the Democratic candidate for governor, [[Phil Murphy]], accused the residents of Mahwah of causing an "overarching perception of anti-Semitism and discrimination".&lt;ref name = "Murphy" /&gt; According to Murphy, "When a Holocaust survivor at a public meeting is heckled, and then denounced as a fraud, there is a problem. When well-intentioned residents are disparaged as 'paid actors' for a 'Jewish money conspiracy scheme' there is a problem."&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite news |title = Murphy slams 'anti-Semitic' rhetoric around Mahwah eruv |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2017/10/20/murphy-slams-anti-semitic-rhetoric-around-mahwah-eruv/786169001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = October 20, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171023235938/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2017/10/20/murphy-slams-anti-semitic-rhetoric-around-mahwah-eruv/786169001/ |archivedate = October 23, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, the [[Attorney General of New Jersey]], [[Christopher Porrino]], sued Mahwah and its council, alleging that by voting for the parks ban and for the summonses, they had violated the constitutional rights of Orthodox Jews. The case, filed in [[New Jersey Superior Court|state court]] in [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]], sought nullification of the council's actions, statutory penalties, attorney's fees, and the return of $3.5 million in state-provided Green Acres funds with which Mahwah had purchased and maintained parks. Under the Green Acres program, parks benefitting from the funds may not discriminate, including on the basis of religion or residency. Porrino stated, "To think that there are local governments here in New Jersey, in 2017, making laws on the basis of some archaic, fear-driven and discriminatory mindset, is deeply disappointing and shocking to many, but it is exactly what we are alleging in this case. Of course, in this case we allege the target of the small-minded bias is not African-Americans, but Orthodox Jews. Nonetheless, the hateful message is the same."&lt;ref name="press release"&gt;{{cite press release |title = Attorney General Porrino announces state lawsuit charging Mahwah Township Council with excluding Orthodox Jews |publisher = Attorney General of New Jersey |date = October 24, 2017 |url = http://nj.gov/oag/newsreleases17/pr20171024a.html |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171026042437/http://nj.gov/oag/newsreleases17/pr20171024a.html |archivedate = October 26, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor Laforet accused Council President Hermansen of fear-mongering and stoking passions, "His disgraceful behavior is now worsened by the severe potential financial penalties facing the township's taxpayer."&lt;ref name="second suit"&gt;{{cite news |title = New Jersey sues Mahwah over eruv, alleging discriminatory ordinance against Orthodox Jews |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2017/10/24/nj-sues-mahwah-alleging-discriminatory-ordinance-against-orthodox-jews-over-eruv/792345001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = October 24, 2017 |last = Racioppi |first = Dustin |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180208133940/https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2017/10/24/nj-sues-mahwah-alleging-discriminatory-ordinance-against-orthodox-jews-over-eruv/792345001/ |archivedate = February 8, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the municipal election on November 7, Mahwah voters easily re-elected two anti-eruv council members, defeating challengers supported by Laforet.&lt;ref name="patch"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mayor Laforet says election results have no bearing on him |url = https://patch.com/new-jersey/mahwah/mayor-laforet-says-election-results-have-no-bearing-him |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = November 9, 2017 |last = Hubbard |first = Daniel |work = Mahwah Patch |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180212083150/https://patch.com/new-jersey/mahwah/mayor-laforet-says-election-results-have-no-bearing-him |archivedate = February 12, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was removed from state to federal court by Mahwah on November 22 as it raised questions under [[United States Constitution|the federal constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |format = PDF |title = Letter from Eric L.

In the Upper Saddle River case, on October 10, 2017, the eruv association moved for a  [[preliminary injunction]] allowing the eruv to remain pending the outcome of the litigation. In support, the association provided documentation showing that Mayor Minichetti had told the borough council about the proposed eruv in 2015, and the new sign ordinance had rapidly followed.&lt;ref name = "preliminary injunction"&gt;{{cite web |title = Notice of Motion for Preliminary Injunction |url = http://www.eruvlitigation.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/17cv5512_25.pdf |format = PDF |date = October 10, 2017 |accessdate = April 10, 2018 |author = Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP |via = EruvLitigation.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the motion, filed on November 2, Upper Saddle River stated that the sign law was tightened because of a divisive municipal election in 2014, that had seen many signs. The borough argued that the lawsuit was premature, as the eruv association had not sought permission. It argued that it had not violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs; its sign ordinance was content-neutral, banning all signs of whatever sort, and thus the plaintiffs had not been discriminated against. It alleged that permission to erect the lechis from Orange and Rockland was insufficient; the eruv association also had to comply with local law, and in any event the communications company [[Verizon]] had joint use of the poles and had not been asked for consent. Upper Saddle River distinguished its situation from that of Tenafly, stating that in Tenafly, exceptions had been made to the sign ordinance, but in Upper Saddle River it had been strictly enforced.&lt;ref name="usr brief"&gt;{{cite web |title = Defendant Borough of Upper Saddle River's Memorandum of Law |url = https://www.usrtoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/FILED-Brief-Doc-29.pdf |format = PDF |pages = 3–5 |publisher = Borough of Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = November 2, 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180319011458/https://www.usrtoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/FILED-Brief-Doc-29.pdf |archivedate = March 19, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of December, Montvale Mayor Ghassali indicated that his borough was negotiating with the plaintiffs, seeking to reach an amicable settlement of the federal lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Montvale negotiations"&gt;{{cite news |title = Montvale working to settle eruv lawsuit |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/12/28/montvale-working-settle-eruv-lawsuit/985488001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = December 28, 2017 |last = Nolan |first = Sarah |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180104100021/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/12/28/montvale-working-settle-eruv-lawsuit/985488001/ |archivedate = January 4, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settlements==
Murphy was elected governor in November and designated Bergen County Prosecutor Grewal as the new Attorney General. Thus, once they took office, opponents of Mahwah's position would hold powerful posts in the state capital of [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], and municipal officials began to have second thoughts about whether to fight the eruv.&lt;ref name="Mahwah change"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mahwah changes its mind |url = http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/mahwah-changes-its-mind/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = December 21, 2017 |last = Yudelson |first = Larry |work = The Jewish Standard |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180212085109/http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/mahwah-changes-its-mind/ |archivedate = February 12, 2018 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 14, 2017, following the advice of legal counsel, the Mahwah council repealed the still-unenforced ban on out-of-state park users, and abandoned an attempt to amend the sign ordinance to bar "other matter" (the lechis) from being affixed to utility poles.&lt;ref name = "Mahwah walk back" /&gt; The "other matter" language would have imitated the 2015 changes to the Upper Saddle River sign law which had followed Minichetti informing the borough council about the plans for the eruv, and was withdrawn, according to Hermansen, lest Mahwah's motives be misinterpreted.&lt;ref name="usr discrimination"&gt;{{cite news |title = Upper Saddle River sign ordinance targeted eruv, Orthodox Jewish group alleges |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/upper-saddle-river/2017/12/06/upper-saddle-river-sign-ordinance-targeted-eruv-orthodox-jewish-group-alleges/925507001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = December 6, 2017 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171206125835/http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/upper-saddle-river/2017/12/06/upper-saddle-river-sign-ordinance-targeted-eruv-orthodox-jewish-group-alleges/925507001/ |archivedate = December 6, 2017 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vote to repeal the park ban was unanimous, with one council member absent. After the vote, Laforet called the ordinances "ill-advised" before being silenced by the council. He resumed outside the council chamber and disclosed that the members could have faced prosecution. "They are hiding from you that if they failed to do so, the Attorney General can come into Mahwah to press civil or criminal bias charges.

The Upper Saddle River lawsuit was scheduled for argument before Judge [[John Michael Vazquez]] of the federal court for New Jersey. When he convened that hearing on January 9, 2018, rather than hear the lawyers argue the positions set forth in the legal briefs, Judge Vazquez told them his views. He questioned whether the borough had consistently enforced the ordinance, as plaintiffs' lawyers had discovered a number of signs and even mailboxes attached to utility poles, that Upper Saddle River had not taken down. The judge voiced his skepticism that the 2015 sign ordinance had been passed because of a contentious municipal election the previous year, as the borough maintained, and indicated that he was inclined to believe it was passed because of the eruv. He urged Upper Saddle River to try to settle the case, and to do so in coordination with the other two municipalities—he was also presiding judge in those cases.&lt;ref name = "January 9 settlement"&gt;{{cite news |title = Judge urges Upper Saddle River to settle eruv litigation |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/upper-saddle-river/2018/01/09/upper-saddle-river-urged-settle-eruv-litigation/1018844001/ |accessdate = February 10, 2018 |date = January 9, 2018 |last = Nobile |first = Tom |work = NorthJersey.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2018, the Mahwah council voted 5–2 to accept a negotiated settlement of the eruv litigation, despite  some residents who urged the council to fight all the way to the Supreme Court.

Montvale also undertook negotiations with the eruv association plaintiffs.

Montvale will pay the eruv association attorneys at Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP $10,000 towards legal costs and be shielded from further lawsuits from it for two years. Yehudah Buchweitz, an attorney for the eruv association, stated: "Our lawsuit against Montvale was filed to permit an eruv in a small portion of Montvale, so families could enjoy the same religious freedom as so many others throughout Bergen and Rockland counties and beyond.

In September 2018, a settlement between the Attorney General and Mahwah was announced. The township is to repeal the two controversial ordinances and agreed not to enact the new sign ordinance and to notify the Attorney General of any proposed legislation on these subjects for the following four years. The mayor and council are to issue a joint statement affirming that the existing sign ordinance, and those dealing with parks and recreation, will be enforced in a nondiscriminatory manner. A breach by Mahwah within the four year period could result in penalties of $100,000; a proposed $350,000 fine was suspended.&lt;ref name="ag settlement"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/2018/09/17/mahwah-nj-attorney-generals-office-settle-discrimination-lawsuit/1338480002/ |title = Mahwah and NJ Attorney General's office settle eruv, parks discrimination lawsuit |accessdate = September 17, 2018 |date = September 17, 2018 |last = Stoltz |first = Marsha |work = NorthJersey.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthony Paul Bamford, Baron Bamford''', [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] (born 23 October 1945) is a British businessman, chairman of [[J. C. Bamford|JCB]]. He succeeded his father, [[Joseph Cyril Bamford]], as chairman and managing director of JCB in 1975, at the age of 30. He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=52543 |date=28 May 1991 |page=8207}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 45. His wealth was estimated at £3.1 billion as of April 2012.&lt;ref name="Sunday Times Rich List 2012"&gt;{{cite web |title= Sunday Times Rich List |url= http://www.therichest.org/nation/sunday-times-rich-list/ |publisher=Sunday Times |accessdate= 16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Bamford was educated at [[Ampleforth College]], a boarding independent school near the village and [[civil parish]] of [[Ampleforth]] in the [[Ryedale]] district of [[North Yorkshire]], England (about {{Convert|23|mi|km|disp=sqbr}} north of [[York]], and on the edge of the [[North York Moors National Park]]), followed by the [[University of Grenoble]], a former university in the city of [[Grenoble]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debretts.com/people-of-today/profile/896/Anthony-Paul-Bamford-BAMFORD|title=Anthony Paul Bamford BAMFORD – BIOGRAPHY|work=[[Debrett's People of Today]]|publisher=[[Debrett's]]|accessdate=4 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140707045224/http://www.debretts.com/people-of-today/profile/896/Anthony-Paul-Bamford-BAMFORD|archivedate=7 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Bamford has been outspoken on the need for the Government to champion manufacturing in the UK and commissioned a report in 2012 on the subject which was sent directly to [[David Cameron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/10216077/Sir-Anthony-Bamford-and-Dame-Lucy-Neville-Rolfe-lead-list-of-new-business-peers.html | location=London | work= The Daily Telegraph | first=James | last=Quinn | title= Sir Anthony Bamford and Dame Lucy Neville-Rolfe lead list of new business peers | date=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elevated to the House of Lords in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/working-peerages-announced Working Peerages announced] Gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

Bamford expressed an interest in purchasing [[Jaguar Cars]] in August 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contractjournal.com/Articles/2006/08/24/51974/jcbs-sir-anthony-bamford-eyes-jaguar.html |title=JCB's Sir Anthony Bamford eyes Jaguar |date=24 August 2006 |publisher=Contract Journal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531235919/http://www.contractjournal.com/Articles/2006/08/24/51974/jcbs-sir-anthony-bamford-eyes-jaguar.html |archivedate=31 May 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; but backed out when he was told the sale would also involve [[Land Rover]], which he did not wish to buy.

Bamford is married to [[Carole Bamford|Carole, Lady Bamford, OBE]].

Outside of business, Bamford is a well-known collector of early vintage [[Ferrari]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferraris-online.com/pages/article.php?reqart=SCM_200606_SS|title=New Faces, New Tastes|website=www.ferraris-online.com|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the only individual to own two [[Ferrari 250 GTO]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Okulski|first=Travis|title=Here Is A List of All The People Who Own Ferrari 250 GTOs|url=http://jalopnik.com/5974535/here-is-a-list-of-all-the-people-that-own-ferrari-250-gtos|publisher=Jalopnik|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also once the owner of a [[Mercedes-Benz W196|1954 Mercedes-Benz W196]] grand prix car raced by the five-time world champion [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] of Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/automobiles/a-singular-mercedes-aims-for-another-record.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Leo | last=Levine | title=A Singular Mercedes Aims for Another Record | date=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, he sued the then MP [[Jeffrey Archer]] for bankruptcy after Archer failed to repay a £172,000 loan. Archer had lost the money in a fraudulent share scam. Archer later repaid the money from his earnings as a novelist and Bamford subsequently withdrew the bankruptcy notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1334660/He-lied-his-way-to-the-top.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Caroline | last=Davies | title=He lied his way to the top | date=20 July 2001 |accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Bamford is a major donor to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and donated £1m before the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]]. Altogether, Bamford has donated more than £4m personally and through JCB companies.

Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] recommended Bamford for a [[Peerage of the United Kingdom|peerage]] in 2010. However, Bamford withdrew his name from consideration days before the members were announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/31/anthony-bamford-conservatives-donor-peerage |title=Conservatives confirm leading party donor withdrew from peerage list &amp;#124; Politics &amp;#124; The Guardian|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] |location=London |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |accessdate=31 October 2012 |first=Vikram |last=Dodd |date=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 October 2013 he was created a [[life peer]] taking the title '''Baron Bamford''', of [[Daylesford, Gloucestershire|Daylesford]] in the County of Gloucestershire and of [[Wootton, Staffordshire|Wootton]] in the County of Staffordshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=60649 |date= 7 October 2013 |page=19679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, Bamford wrote a letter in support of voting to leave the [[European Union]] to his employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36485985|title= EU referendum: JCB chairman tells staff of Brexit support|date=15 June 2016|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; JCB has donated £100,000 to the [[Vote Leave]] campaign. In 2000, JCB was fined £22m (€39.6m) by the EU for [[European Union competition law|antitrust]] breaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/dec/22/6|title=JCB hit by £22m competition fine|date=15 June 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-00-1526_en.htm?locale=en|title=Commission fines JCB for unlawful distribution agreements and practices|date=21 December 2000|work=European Commission Press Release Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bamford is also close to [[Tony Blair]] and [[Prince Charles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/big-wheel-the-social-circle-of-sir-anthony-bamford-413006.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Big Wheel: The social circle of Sir Anthony Bamford | date=23 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Calendar reform''', properly '''calendrical reform''', is any significant revision of a [[calendar]] system. The term sometimes is used instead for a proposal to switch to a different calendar design.

== Principles ==

The prime objective of a calendar is to unambiguously identify any day throughout history by a specific date. 
Periods that contain multiple days, like weeks, months and even years, are secondary features of a calendar for convenience.
Most cultures adopt a primary dating system, but different cultures have always needed to align multiple calendars with each other, because they coexisted in the same space (e.g. secular and religious groups with different demands) or had established trading relations. 
Once specified, a ''calendar design'' cannot be altered without becoming a new one, but if a design is sufficiently close to the one used before in the local ''calendar system'', switching to it and hence a calendar reform is possible without disruption. 
Some design changes, however, will yield date identifiers different from the previous design for some days, often in the distant past or future. 
The calendar system must clarify whether dates are changed to the new design retroactively (using a ''proleptic calendar'') or whether the design in use then and there shall be respected. 
Calendar schisms happen if not all cultures that adopted a common calendar system before perform a calendar reform at the same time. 
If date identifiers are similar but different, confusion and mistakes are unavoidable. 


Most calendars have several rules which could be altered by reform:
* Whether and how days are grouped into subdivisions such as [[month]]s and [[week]]s, and days outside those subdivisions, if any.
* Which years are [[leap year]]s and [[common year]]s and how they differ.
* Numbering of years, selection of the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]], and the issue of [[0 (year)|year zero]].
* Start of the year (such as the [[December solstice]], 1 January, 1 March, [[March equinox]], [[Lady Day]]).
* If a week is retained, the start, length, and names of its days.
* Start of the day (midnight, sunrise, noon, or sunset).
* If months are retained, number, lengths, and names of months.
* Special days and periods (such as leap day or intercalary day).
* Alignment with social cycles.
* Alignment with astronomical cycles.
* Alignment with biological cycles.
* Literal notation of dates.

== Historical reforms ==
Historically, most calendar reforms have been made in order to synchronize the calendar with the astronomical year (either [[solar year|solar]] or [[sidereal year|sidereal]]) and/or the [[synodic month]] in [[lunar calendar|lunar]] or [[lunisolar calendar]]s. Most reforms for calendars have been to make them more accurate. This has happened to various lunar and lunisolar calendars, and also the Julian calendar when it was altered to the Gregorian calendar.

The fundamental problems of the calendar are that the astronomical year has neither a whole number of days nor a whole number of lunar months; neither does the lunar month have a whole number of days: in each case there are fractions "left over". (In some physical circumstances the rotations and revolutions of a planet and its satellite(s) can be phase-locked —for example the same side of the moon always faces us— but this has not operated to lock together the lengths of the Earth's year, day and month.) Such remainders could accumulate from one period to the next, thereby driving the cycles out of synch.

A typical solution to force synchronization is '[[intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]]'. This means occasionally adding an extra day (or month) into the cycle. An alternative approach is to ignore the mismatch and simply let the cycles continue to drift apart. The general approaches include:

* The lunar calendar, which fits days into the cycle of lunar months, adding an extra day when needed, while ignoring the annual solar cycle of the seasons.
* The solar calendar, which fits artificial months into the year, adding an extra day into one month when needed, while ignoring the lunar cycle of new/full moons.
* The lunisolar calendar, which keeps both the lunar and solar cycles, adding an extra month into the year when needed.

An obvious disadvantage of the lunisolar method of inserting a whole extra month is the large irregularity of the length of the year from one to the next. The simplicity of a lunar calendar has always been outweighed by its inability to track the seasons, and a solar calendar is used in conjunction to remedy this defect. Identifying the lunar cycle month requires straightforward observation of the Moon on a clear night. However, identifying seasonal cycles requires much more methodical observation of stars or a device to track solar day-to-day progression, such as that established at places like [[Stonehenge]]. After centuries of empirical observations, the theoretical aspects of calendar construction could become more refined, enabling predictions that identified the need for reform.

=== Reform of lunar and lunisolar calendars ===
There have been 50 to 100 reforms of the traditional [[Chinese calendar]] over 2500 years, most of which were intended to better fit the calendar months to astronomical lunations and to more accurately add the extra month so that the regular months maintain their proper seasonal positions, even though each seasonal marker can occur anywhere within its month.
There have been at least four similar reforms of the lunisolar version of the [[Hindu calendar]], all intended to make the month a better match to the lunation and to make the year a better fit to the ''sidereal'' year. There have been reforms of the ''solar'' version of the Hindu calendar which changed the distribution of the days in each month to better match the length of time that the Sun spends in each ''sidereal'' zodiacal sign. The same applies to the [[Buddhist calendar]]. The first millennium reform of the [[Hebrew calendar]] changed it from an observational calendar into a calculated calendar. The [[Islamic calendar]] was a reform of the preceding lunisolar calendar which completely divorced it from the solar year.

Another reform was performed in [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuk Persia]] by [[Omar Khayyam]] and others, developing the precisely computed [[Jalali calendar]].

=== Julian and Gregorian reforms ===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
When [[Julius Caesar]] took power in Rome, the [[Roman calendar]] had ceased to reflect the year accurately.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The [[Julian calendar|Julian reform]] lengthened seven months and replaced the intercalary month with an intercalary day to be inserted within February every four years. This produced a noticeably more accurate calendar, but it had an average year length of 365 days and 6 hours (365.25 d). This had the effect of adding about three-quarters of an hour every four years. The effect accumulated from inception in 45 BC until by the 16th century the northward equinox was falling on March 10 or 11.

[[Image:William Hogarth 028.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[William Hogarth]]’s ''[[Humours of an Election|An Election Entertainment]]'' includes a banner with the protest slogan against the Gregorian calendar: "Give us our Eleven days" (on floor at lower right)]]

Under [[Pope Gregory XIII]], the leap year rule was altered: century years which are not divisible by 400 would be common years. So 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are not leap years. This rule makes the mean year 365.2425 days {{nowrap|(365&amp;nbsp;d, 5&amp;nbsp;h, 49&amp;nbsp;min, 12&amp;nbsp;s)}} long.  While this does not synchronize the years entirely, it would require a few thousand years to accumulate a day.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Blackburn and Leofranc Holford-Strevens, ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'', corrected printing (Oxford University Press, 2013), 692.&lt;/ref&gt;

So that the northward equinox would have the same date in the new Gregorian calendar as it had when the Council of Nicaea made recommendations in AD 325 ({{nowrap|March 21}}), ten days were dropped so that {{nowrap|October 5}} became {{nowrap|October 15}} in 1582. This reform took a few centuries to spread through the nations that used the Julian calendar, although the Russian church year still uses the Julian calendar. Those nations that adopted this calendar on or after 1700 had to drop more than ten days: Great Britain, for instance, dropped eleven.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

In 1923, [[Milutin Milanković]] proposed to a [[synod]] of some [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es at [[Constantinople]] that only those centennial years (those ending in 00) that leave a remainder of 200 or 600 upon division by 900 would be leap years, decreasing the average year length to 365.242222 days. These remainders were chosen to delay the first year (after 1923) that this calendar would disagree with the Gregorian calendar as much as possible, until 2800. It was adopted by some Eastern Orthodox Churches under the names [[Revised Julian calendar]] or New calendar, but was rejected by others.

== Proposals ==
The [[Gregorian calendar]] is currently used by most of the world. There is also an international standard describing the calendar, [[ISO 8601]], with some differences to traditional conceptions in many cultures.

Since the papal reform in 1582, several proposals have been offered to make the Gregorian calendar more useful or regular. Very few reforms have gained official acceptance. The rather different [[decimal calendar|decimal]] [[French Republican Calendar]] was one such official reform, but was abolished twelve years later by [[Napoleon]]. After [[World War II]], the newly formed United Nations continued efforts of its predecessor, the [[League of Nations]], to establish the proposed [[World Calendar]] but postponed the issue after a veto from the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]], which was mainly based upon concerns of religious groups about the proposed days that would be outside the seven-day week cycle ("blank days") and thus disrupt having a sabbath every seven days.  Independently the [[World Council of Churches]] still tries to find a common rule for the date of Easter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/wcc-commissions/faith-and-order-commission/i-unity-the-church-and-its-mission/towards-a-common-date-for-easter/towards-a-common-date-for-easter.html|title=Towards a Common Date for Easter|author=World Council of Churches|date=1997-03-10|website=www.oikoumene.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which might be eased by a new common calendar.

Reformers cite several problems with the Gregorian calendar:
* It is not [[Perennial Calendar|perennial]]. Each year starts on a different day of the week and calendars expire every year.
* It is difficult to determine the weekday of any given day of the year or month.
* Months are not equal in length, nor regularly distributed across the year, and so some people rely on [[mnemonic]]s (e.g., "[[Thirty days hath September]]" or [[Knuckle_mnemonic|knuckle counting]]) to remember the lengths of months.
* The year's four quarters (of three full months each) are not equal (being of 90/91, 91, 92 and 92 days respectively). [[Business quarter]]s that are equal would make accounting easier.
* Its epoch, i.e. start of the year count, is religious. The same applies to month and [[weekday]] names in many languages.
* Each month has no connection with the [[lunar phase]]s.
* Solstices and equinoxes do not coincide with either the beginning of the Gregorian months or the midpoint of the months.
* The calendar does not have a [[Year Zero|year zero]], the year after [[1 BC]] was [[1 AD]], with nothing in between them. 

It is hard or even impossible to solve all these issues in just one calendar.

Most plans evolve around the solar year of a little more than 365 days. This number does not divide well by seven or twelve, which are the traditional numbers of days per week and months per year respectively. The nearby numbers 360, 364 and 366 are divisible in better ways. There are also lunar-centric proposals.

=== Perennial calendars ===

{{see also|Perennial calendar}}
Many calendar reforms have offered solutions to make the Gregorian calendar perennial. These reforms would make it easy to work out the day of the week of a particular [[calendar date|date]], and would make changing calendars each year unnecessary. There are, roughly speaking, two options to achieve this goal: [[leap week calendar]]s and [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary days]]. Leap week calendars add a leap week of seven days to the calendar every five or six years to keep the calendar roughly in step with the tropical year. They have years of either 364 days (52 weeks) or 371 days (53 weeks), thus preserving the 7-day week.

Proposals mainly differ in their selection of a leap rule, placing of the leap item (usually middle or end of the year), in the start day of the week and year, in the number (12 or 13) and size of months and in connected naming; some are compatible to the [[week date]] of ISO 8601.

The [[World Calendar]], favored by the UN in the 1950s, and the [[International Fixed Calendar]], quite popular among economists between the World Wars, are proposals that start each year on a Sunday. The 364 days within the week system form 52 weeks of 7 days. The World Calendar has every quarter beginning on the same day of the week. In the World Calendar, the 365th and 366th day are considered holidays and named Worlds Day and Leap Year Day. These "off-calendar" days stand outside the seven-day week and caused some religious groups to strongly oppose adoption of the World Calendar. Such concerns helped prevent the World Calendar from being adopted. Supporters of the World Calendar, however, argue that the religious groups' opposition overlooked every individual's right to celebrate these holidays as extra days of worship, or [[Sabbath]]s. This option, they reason, maintained the seven-day worship cycle for those who share that concern, while allowing benefits of a perennial calendar to be shared by all.

Some calendar reform ideas, such as the [[Pax Calendar]], [[Symmetry454]] calendar and the [[Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar]], were created to solve this problem by having years of either 364 days (52 weeks) or 371 days (53 weeks), thus preserving the 7-day week. The 53-week calendar, used in government and in business for [[fiscal year]]s, is a variant of this concept. Each year of this calendar can be up to 371 days long.

Some calendars have quarters of regularly patterned uneven months e.g., a 35-day (five-week) month and a pair of 28-day (four-week) months, with a leap week appended to the final month when needed. The Common Civil Calendar and Time calendar has months of 30 and 31 days, but inserts a leap week in the middle of the year, when needed, whereas its successor, the Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar, moves the extra week to the end of the year.

In the [[Isaac Asimov#Other writings|World Season Calendar]], months are discarded altogether; instead, the year is divided into four seasons of 13 weeks each.  An extra day (two days during leap year) is added to the calendar that is not assigned a day of the week in order to perennialize the calendar. The same calendar of 91 days is used for each season of every year.

Still other proposals, like the 30x11 Calendar, abandon attempts to make the calendar perennial, instead opting for eleven 30-day months and one long month at the end of 35 (or 36) days.

=== Systematic 12-month calendars ===
{{OR|date=June 2018}}

The lengths of the months inherited from the old [[Roman calendar]] as reformed by Julius Caesar do not follow any apparent logic systematically. Many reform proposals seek to make the pattern more uniform. 
When keeping the traditional dozen of months and the close approximation of a solar year, this usually yields four equal quarters of three months each where one month is longer than the other two. The most common approaches are 30∶30∶31, 30∶31∶30 and 31∶30∶30 days per month, but 4∶4∶5, 4∶5∶4 and 5∶4∶4 weeks per months have also been proposed or used. They all result in 364 systematically distributed days and hence have to add either one extra and one leap day or a leap week. 
Some calendar designs do not use the same pattern for all quarters but, for instance, flip it in the middle of the year. This is more common with 31∶30 and 30∶31 patterns, which lead to 366 days of which one needs to be dropped in common years, since that is basically what the Julian and Gregorian calendars do except that July also has 31 days and February never has 30.

Incidentally, the close correspondence to existing conventions is often considered an advantage, but even patterns that deviate more may have strong benefits. For instance, all quarterly patterns with 30 and 31 days per month result in a week distribution of 4∶5∶4 if a week is counted for the month most of its days belong to and the first day of the first month is also the first day of a week.

A change in month lengths will frequently also result in months starting at a different ordinal day of the year, especially since all regular designs lengthen February. For a non-leap year, all designs with 91-day quarters realign in October with the Julian pattern and some as early as June, while all designs that are alternating odd and even months completely mismatch after January even if the last day of February remained the leap day.

=== 13-month calendars ===
&lt;!-- perennialization and 13 months are not mutually exclusive --&gt;

Some calendar reformers seek to equalize the length of each month in the year. This is often accomplished by creating a calendar that has 13 months of 4 weeks (28 days) each, making 364 days. The earliest known proposal of this type was the Georgian Calendar (1745)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Georgian Calendar|url=http://myweb.ecu.edu/mccartyr/hirossa.html|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Hugh Jones (reverend)|Rev. Hugh Jones]].

The [[Positivist calendar]] (1849), created by [[Auguste Comte]], was based on a 364-day year which included one or two “blank” days. Each of the 13 months had 28 days and exactly four weeks, and each started on a Monday. The [[International Fixed Calendar]] is a more modern descendant of this calendar.

Some proposals&lt;!--, such as the [[Sol Calendar]],--&gt; add one or two days to the calendar each year to account for the annual solar cycle, while others keep these days off the calendar entirely, to make the calendar perennial.

Around 1930 Colligan invented the [[Pax Calendar]], which avoids off-calendar days by adding a 7-day [[leap week calendar|leap week]] to the 364-day common year for 71 out of 400 years. &lt;!-- The New Earth Calendar does likewise with a different leap rule. --&gt;

In 1993, Lloydine and [[José Argüelles]] founded the World Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lightparty.com/Spirituality/World13MoonCalendar.html|title=The World 13 Moon Calendar Peace Movement
|author=The Light Party|date=|website=lightparty.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{importance inline}}

Dividing the years into 52 weeks creates 13 months of 28 days (4 weeks), and 4 quarters of 91 days (13 weeks). This creates months and quarters of fixed, even duration, but not quarters containing a whole number of months.

Instead of a leap week or an extra day and a leap day, such a calendar design could add a 14th ''leap month'' of 4 weeks about every 22 years.
While the Gregorian leap cycle of 400 years contains a whole number of 7-day weeks, this number is not divisible by 4, so this cycle would not be a good fit for a leap month calendar.

===19-month calendar===
The [[Bahá'í calendar]], established by the founders of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], does not seek to reform the Gregorian calendar, but establishes a purely solar calendar. As of 2015, the year always starts in spring on the sunset to sunset day of the vernal equinox (calculated in advance). This calendar has 19 months of 19 days, with an extra 4 or 5 intercalary days added so that the year ends on the day before the next vernal equinox.

=== Lunisolar calendars ===
{{See also|Lunisolar calendar}}

Lunisolar calendars usually have 12 or 13 months of 29 or 30 days.
&lt;!--
The [[Hermetic Lunar Week Calendar]] is a lunisolar calendar proposal which has 12 or 13 lunar months of 29 or 30 days a year, and begins each year near the [[vernal equinox]].
--&gt;&lt;!--
[[The Simple Lunisolar Calendar]] uses 12 or 13 lunar months of 30 or 29 days with fixed lengths, and begins each year between Gregorian December 3 and January 1.
--&gt;&lt;!--
The [[Meyer-Palmen Solilunar Calendar]] has 12 lunar months with 29 or 30 days plus a leap month called [[Meton]] every 3 or 2 years with 30 or 31 days. 60 years together are called a cycle. It uses a leap cycle which has equal number of days, weeks, months, years and cycles. 2498258 days, 356894 weeks, 84599 months, 6840 years and 114 cycles nearly all equal each other. It is called an era, although time isn't divided into it in this calendar.
--&gt;
Some propose to improve leap rules of existing calendars, such as the [[Hebrew calendar]]. The [[Rectified Hebrew calendar]] uses a more accurate leap cycle of 4366 months per 353-year cycle, with 130 leap years per cycle, and a progressively shorter ''[[molad]]'' interval, intended to replace the 19-year leap cycle and the constant ''molad'' interval of the traditional fixed arithmetic Hebrew calendar, respectively.

=== Naming ===
Calendar proposals that introduce a thirteenth month or change the Julian-Gregorian system of months often also propose new names for these months. New names have also been proposed for days out of the week cycle (e.g., 365th and leap) and weeks out of the month cycle.

Proposals to change the traditional month and weekday names are less frequent. The Gregorian calendar obtains its names mostly from gods of historical religions (e.g., Thursday from Nordic [[Thor]] or March from Roman [[Mars (god)|Mars]]) or leaders of vanished empires (July and August from the first Cæsars), or ordinals that got out of synchronization (September through December, originally seventh through tenth, now ninth through twelfth).

Calendar reformers, therefore, seek to correct what they see as deficiencies by focusing on more homogeneous sets of individuals, who usually share common traits.

==== Examples ====
Comte’s Positivist calendar, for example, proposed naming the 13 months in his calendar after figures from religion, literature, philosophy and science. Similarly, the [[Hermetic Lunar Week Calendar]] uses 12 or 13 lunar months named after 13 contributors to research on psychoactive plants and chemicals. The [[Simple Lunisolar Calendar]] names its months after the letters of the [[Greek alphabet]].

Some, such as Karl Palmen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/palmen/playcard.htm|title=Playing Card Calendar|author=Karl Palmen|date=2001-01-15|website=www.hermetic.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested reusing an existing 13 × 4 naming system, the one found in [[playing cards]]. Thus either months are numbered Ace, Two through Ten, Jack, Queen and King with four weeks each, named after the four [[suit (cards)|suit]]s (♠♣♥♦); or the roles are reversed if the calendar has four quarters with thirteen weeks each. Leap days or weeks are assigned the Joker. This system has internationalisation problems, though, because even where the 52-card deck is known, the order of suits may vary.

The contemporary [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]] has 26 letters, which could be used, together with a further binary indicator, as keys for 52 weeks.

== Specific proposals ==
{{main|List of calendars}}
There have been many specific calendar proposals to replace the Gregorian calendar:

The following count one or more days outside the standard seven-day week:
* [[Positivist calendar]]
* [[World Calendar|The World Calendar]]
* [[International Fixed Calendar]]
* [[Invariable Calendar]]
* [[World Season Calendar]]
* [[Tranquility Calendar]]

The following are leap week calendars:
* [[Pax Calendar]]

The following track the moon as well as the sun:
* Hermetic Lunar Week Calendar
* Rectified Hebrew calendar

There have also been proposals to revise the way years are numbered:
* [[Anno Lucis]]
* [[Holocene calendar]]
* [[Japanese era name|Jomon Era]]

Reform of the Islamic calendar:

Since the beginning of the 21st century, there is a trend within the Muslim communities of North America and Europe to substitute a lunar calendar based on calculations for the traditional Islamic method of monthly observation of the new moon to declare the beginning of the new month in each country separately. The details are in the following study:

[[Image:NSALibertyReport.p13.jpg|thumb|A typical classified document. Page 13 of a [[U.S. National Security Agency]] report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/uss_liberty/attack_sigint.pdf |title=United States Cryptologic History: Attack on a Sigint Collector, the U.S.S. Liberty |publisher=NSA.gov |accessdate=2012-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030155345/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/uss_liberty/attack_sigint.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[USS Liberty incident|USS ''Liberty'' incident]], partially declassified and released to the public in July 2004. The original overall classification of the page, "top secret", and the Special Intelligence code word "umbra", are shown at top and bottom. The classification of individual paragraphs and reference titles is shown in parentheses—there are six different levels on this page alone. Notations with leader lines at top and bottom cite statutory authority for not declassifying certain sections.]]

'''Classified information''' is material that a government body deems to be [[sensitive information]] that must be protected. Access is restricted by [[law]] or regulation to particular groups of people with the necessary security clearance and need to know, and ''intentionally''  mishandling of the material can incur criminal penalties. A formal [[security clearance]] is required to view or handle classified documents or to access classified data. The clearance process requires a satisfactory background investigation. Documents and other information ''must be properly'' marked ''by the author'' with one of several (hierarchical) levels of sensitivity—e.g. restricted, confidential, secret and top secret. The choice of level is based on an impact assessment; governments have their own criteria, which include how to determine the classification of an information asset, and rules on how to protect information classified at each level. This often includes security clearances for personnel handling the information. Although "classified information" refers to the formal [[categorization]] and marking of material by level of sensitivity, it has also developed a sense synonymous with "[[censorship|censored]]" in [[American English|US English]]. A distinction is often made between formal security classification and privacy markings such as "commercial in confidence". Classifications can be used with additional keywords that give more detailed instructions on how data should be used or protected.

Some [[corporation]]s and non-government organizations also assign levels of protection to their private information, either from a desire to protect [[trade secret]]s, or because of laws and regulations governing various matters such as [[personal privacy]], sealed legal proceedings and the timing of financial information releases.

With the passage of time much classified information ''can'' become ''a bit less sensitive, or'' becomes ''much'' less sensitive, and may be declassified and made public. Since the late twentieth century there has been [[freedom of information legislation]] in some countries, whereby the public is deemed to have the right to all information that is not considered to be damaging if released. Sometimes documents are released with information still considered confidential obscured ([[Sanitization (classified information)|redacted]]), as in the example at right.

==Government classification==
The purpose of classification is to protect information. Higher classifications protect information that might endanger [[national security]]. Classification formalises what constitutes a "state secret" and accords different levels of protection based on the expected damage the information might cause in the wrong hands.

However, classified information is frequently "leaked" to reporters by officials for political purposes. Several U.S. presidents have leaked sensitive information to get their point across to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Stansfield |authorlink=Stansfield Turner |title=Burn Before Reading: Presidents, CIA Directors and Secret Intelligence |location=New York |publisher=Hyperion |year=2005 |isbn=9780786867820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/classified-information-woodwards-obamas-wars |title=Classified Information in Woodward's 'Obama’s Wars' |first=Jack |last=Goldsmith |work=Lawfare |date=29 September 2010 |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical classification levels==
Although the classification systems vary from country to country, most have levels corresponding to the following British definitions (from the highest level to lowest).

==={{Visible anchor|Top Secret (TS)}}===
[[File:KGB traitors list seen in Museum of Genocide Victims Vilnius.jpg|thumb|KGB traitors list seen in Museum of Genocide Victims Vilnius: originally marked ''top secret'']]
''Top Secret'' is the highest level of classified information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary|date=2004|publisher=Random House|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0375425993|edition=2. ed., [Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information is further compartmented so that specific access using a code word after ''top secret'' is a legal way to hide collective and important information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/pdf/customer/STINFOdata/DoD5200_1ph.pdf | title =DoD Guide to Marking Classified Documents | author =''[[Defense Technical Information Center]]'' | publisher =dtic.mil | date =April 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such material would cause "exceptionally grave damage" to [[national security]] if made publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://fas.org/sgp/library/quist2/chap_7.html#1 | title =Chapter 7. CLASSIFICATION LEVELS | author =''[[Federation of American Scientists]]'' | publisher =fas.org | date =June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1942, the United Kingdom and other members of the British Empire used ''Most Secret'', but this was later changed to match the United States' category name of ''Top Secret'' in order to simplify Allied interoperability.

''The Washington Post'' reports in an investigation entitled ''Top Secret America'', that per 2010 "An estimated 854,000 people ... hold top-secret security clearances" in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/a-hidden-world-growing-beyond-control/ |title=A hidden world, growing beyond control |first1=Dana |last1=Priest |first2=William |last2=Arkin |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=19 July 2010 |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secret===
{{Quote box|quote='''''“It is desired that no document be released which refers to [[Unethical human experimentation in the United States|experiments with humans]] and might have adverse effect on public opinion or result in legal suits. Documents covering such work field should be classified 'secret'.”'''''|source=April 17, 1947 Atomic Energy Commission memo from Colonel O.G. Haywood, Jr. to Dr. Fidler at the Oak Ridge Laboratory in Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/radiation/dir/mstreet/commeet/meet9/brief9/tab_i/br9i2.txt Atomic Energy Commission's Declassification Review of Reports on Human Experiments and the Public Relations and Legal Liability Consequences] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606120441/https://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/radiation/dir/mstreet/commeet/meet9/brief9/tab_i/br9i2.txt |date=2013-06-06 }}, presented as evidence during the 1994 ACHRE hearings.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, [[Executive Order 13526]] bans classification of documents simply to "conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error" or "prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency".&lt;ref&gt;Section 1.7 (1) and (2).&lt;/ref&gt;|width=25%}}

''Secret'' material would cause "serious damage" to national security if it were publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/petaluma/e-pme/e-pme/apprentice/G-Lessons/4-G-03.pdf |title=E-PME Enlisted PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION Reporting Unsecured and Securing Classified Material 4.G.03 |author=''[[United States Coast Guard]]'' |publisher=uscg.mil }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, operational "Secret" information can be marked with an additional "LIMDIS", to limit distribution.

===Confidential===
''Confidential'' material would cause damage or be prejudicial to national security if publicly available.&lt;ref name="GWU Army Regulation (1936)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/radiation/dir/mstreet/commeet/meet14/brief14/tab_d/br14d1b.txt |title=ATTACHMENT 2 AR 320-5, CLASSIFICATION OFC. Army Regulations (1936) |author=[[George Washington University]] |publisher=gwu.edu |access-date=2013-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713152933/http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/radiation/dir/mstreet/commeet/meet14/brief14/tab_d/br14d1b.txt |archive-date=2013-07-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restricted===
''Restricted'' material would cause "undesirable effects" if publicly available. Some countries do not have such a classification; in public sectors, such as commercial industries. Such a level is also known as "''Private'' Information".

===Official===
''Official'' (Equivalent to US DOD classification FOUO – For Official Use Only) material forms the generality of government business, public service delivery and commercial activity. This includes a diverse range of information, of varying sensitivities, and with differing consequences resulting from compromise or loss. OFFICIAL information must be secured against a [[threat model]] that is broadly similar to that faced by a large private company.

The OFFICIAL classification replaced the Confidential and Restricted classifications in April 2014 in the UK.&lt;ref name=UK_Classifications&gt;{{cite book|title=Government Security Classifications April 2014|date=October 2013|publisher=HMG Cabinet Office|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unclassified===
''Unclassified'' is technically not a classification level, but this is a feature of some classification schemes, used for government documents that do not merit a particular classification or which have been declassified. This is because the information is low-impact, and therefore does not require any special protection, such as vetting of personnel.

A plethora of pseudo-classifications exist under this category.

===Clearance===
''Clearance'' is a general classification, that comprises a variety of rules controlling the level of permission required to view some classified information, and how it must be stored, transmitted, and destroyed. Additionally, access is restricted on a "[[need to know]]" basis. Simply possessing a clearance does not automatically authorize the individual to view all material classified at that level or below that level. The individual must present a legitimate "need to know" in addition to the proper level of clearance.

===Compartmented information===
In addition to the general risk-based classification levels, additional [[Sensitive Compartmented Information|compartmented constraints on access]] exist, such as ([[Classified information in the United States#Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and Special Access Programs (SAP)|in the U.S.]]) Special Intelligence (SI), which protects intelligence sources and methods, No Foreign dissemination (NOFORN), which restricts dissemination to U.S. nationals, and Originator Controlled dissemination (ORCON), which ensures that the originator can track possessors of the information. Information in these compartments is usually marked with specific keywords in addition to the classification level.

Government information about [[nuclear weapon]]s often has an additional marking to show it contains such information ([[CNWDI]]).

==International==
When a government agency or group shares information between an agency or group of other country’s government they will generally employ a special classification scheme that both parties have previously agreed to honour.

For example, the marking ATOMAL, is applied to U.S. RESTRICTED DATA or FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA and United Kingdom ATOMIC information that has been released to NATO. ATOMAL information is marked COSMIC TOP SECRET ATOMAL (CTSA), NATO SECRET ATOMAL (NSAT), or NATO CONFIDENTIAL ATOMAL (NCA).

===NATO classifications===
For example, sensitive information shared amongst [[NATO]] allies has four levels of security classification; from most to least classified:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bip.abw.gov.pl/bip/informacje-niejawne-1/ochrona-informacji-nie/153,OCHRONA-INFORMACJI-NIEJAWNYCH-MIEDZYNARODOWYCH-W-SFERZE-CYWILNEJ-I-WOJSKOWEJ.html|title=OCHRONA INFORMACJI NIEJAWNYCH MIĘDZYNARODOWYCH W SFERZE CYWILNEJ I WOJSKOWEJ - Ochrona informacji niejawnych międzynarodowych w sferze cywilnej i wojskowej -  BIP - Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego|first=JSK|last=Internet|date=|website=www.bip.abw.gov.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# COSMIC TOP SECRET (CTS) 
# NATO SECRET (NS)
# NATO CONFIDENTIAL (NC)
# NATO RESTRICTED (NR)

A special case exists with regard to NATO UNCLASSIFIED (NU) information. Documents with this marking are NATO property ([[copyright]]) and must not be made public without NATO permission.

===International organisations===
* [[European Institutions]], have four levels: EU TOP SECRET, EU SECRET, EU CONFIDENTIAL, EU RESTRICTED.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:274:0001:0050:EN:PDF |date=15 October 2013 |title=Decision of 23 September 2013 on the security rules for protecting EU classified information |work=Official Journal of the European Union |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Note that usually the French term is used.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}})
**'''TRÈS SECRET UE/EU TOP SECRET''': information and material the unauthorised disclosure of which could cause exceptionally grave prejudice to the essential interests of the European Union or of one or more of the Member States;
**'''SECRET UE/EU SECRET''': information and material the unauthorised disclosure of which could seriously harm the essential interests of the European Union or of one or more of the Member States;
**'''CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL''': information and material the unauthorised disclosure of which could harm the essential interests of the European Union or of one or more of the Member States;
**'''RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED''': information and material the unauthorised disclosure of which could be disadvantageous to the interests of the European Union or of one or more of the Member States.
* [[Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation]], a European defence organisation, has three levels of classification: OCCAR SECRET, OCCAR CONFIDENTIAL, and OCCAR RESTRICTED.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/Files/kfile/306652_CM6554.pdf |title=306652_CM6554 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-11-14|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20050525181742/http://www.fco.gov.uk/Files/kfile/306652_CM6554.pdf|archivedate=2005-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ECIPS]], the European Centre for Information Policy and Security, has 4 levels of Security Information, COSMIC (TOP SECRET), EC-SECRET, EC-CONFIDENTIAL and EC-COMMITTEES.

==By country==
[[Image:FialkaManualCoverPage.jpg|thumb|Facsimile of the cover page from an [[East Germany|East German]] operation manual for the M-125 [[Fialka]] [[cipher|cipher machine]]. The underlined classification markings can be translated as "Cryptologic material! Secret restricted material" [[:de:Verschlusssache]].]]
Most countries employ some sort of classification system for certain government information. For example, in [[Canada]], information that the U.S. would classify SBU (Sensitive but Unclassified) is called "protected" and further subcategorised into levels A, B, and C.

===Australia===
On 19 July 2011, the National Security (NS) classification marking scheme and the Non-National Security (NNS) classification marking scheme in [[Australia]] was unified into one structure.

The Australian Government Security Classification system now comprises TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL and PROTECTED. A new dissemination limiting markers (DLMs) scheme was also introduced for information where disclosure may be limited or prohibited by legislation, or where it may otherwise require special handling. The DLM marking scheme comprises For Official Use Only (FOUO), Sensitive, Sensitive: Personal, Sensitive: Legal, and Sensitive: Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Documents marked Sensitive Cabinet, relating to discussions in Federal Cabinet, are treated as PROTECTED at minimum due to its higher sensitivity.

===Brazil===
There are three levels of document classification under Brazilian [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2011-2014/2011/Lei/L12527.htm Information Access Law]: ''ultrassecreto'' (top secret), ''secreto'' (secret) and ''reservado'' (restricted).

A top secret (''ultrassecreto'') government-issued document may be classified for a period of 25 years, which may be extended up to another 25 years. Thus, no document remains classified for more than 50 years. This is mandated by the 2011 Information Access Law (''Lei de Acesso à Informação''), a change from the previous rule, under which documents could have their classification time length renewed indefinitely, effectively shuttering state secrets from the public. The 2011 law applies retroactively to existing documents.

===Canada===
{{further|Security clearance#Canada}}

====Background and hierarchy====
The Government of Canada employs two main types of sensitive information designation: ''Classified'' and ''Protected''. The access and protection of both types of information is governed by the ''[[Security of Information Act]]'', effective December 24, 2001, replacing the ''Official Secrets Act 1981''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csis.gc.ca/nwsrm/bckgrndrs/bckgrndr12-eng.asp Security of Information Act],  {{webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080116134930/http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/en/newsroom/backgrounders/backgrounder12.asp |date=January 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To access the information, a person must have the appropriate security clearance and the need to know.

In addition, the caveat "Canadian Eyes Only" is used to restrict access to Classified or Protected information only to Canadian citizens with the appropriate security clearance and need to know.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industrial Security Services - Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://ssi-iss.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/questions/esp-pss-eng.html#q4 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131120011009/http://ssi-iss.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/questions/esp-pss-eng.html#q4 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 November 2013 |work=Public Works and Government Services Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=8 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Special operational information====
SOI is not a classification of data ''per se''. It is defined under the ''Security of Information Act'', and unauthorised release of such information constitutes a higher breach of trust, with penalty of life imprisonment.

SOIs include:
* military operations in respect of a potential, imminent or present armed conflict
* the identity of confidential source of information, intelligence or assistance to the Government of Canada
* tools used for information gathering or intelligence
* the object of a covert investigation, or a covert collection of information or intelligence
* the identity of any person who is under covert surveillance
* encryption and cryptographic systems
* information or intelligence to, or received from, a foreign entity or terrorist group

====Classified information====
Classified information can be designated ''Top Secret'', ''Secret'' or ''Confidential''. These classifications are only used on matters of national interest.
* Top Secret: applies when compromise might reasonably cause exceptionally grave injury to the national interest. The possible impact must be great, immediate and irreparable.
* Secret: applies when compromise might reasonably cause serious injury to the national interest.
* Confidential: disclosure might reasonably cause injury to the national interest.

====Protected information====
Protected information is not classified. It pertains to any sensitive information that does not relate to national security and cannot be disclosed under the access and privacy legislation because of the potential injury to particular public or private interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/pubs/nihb-ssna/_priv/2005_code/index-eng.php#app2 |title=ARCHIVED - Non-Insured Health Benefits Program: Privacy Code, 2005 (Appendix II) |work=Health Canada, First Nations and Inuit Health Branch |year=2015 |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pubs_pol/gospubs/TB_J2/dwnld/spmh_e.rtf Security Policy - Manager's Handbook] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050601030559/http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pubs_pol/gospubs/TB_J2/dwnld/spmh_e.rtf |date=June 1, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Protected C (Extremely Sensitive protected information): designates extremely sensitive information, which if compromised, could reasonably be expected to cause extremely grave injury outside the national interest. Examples include bankruptcy, identities of informants in criminal investigations, etc.
* Protected B (Particularly Sensitive protected information): designates information that could cause severe injury or damage to the people or group involved if it was released. Examples include medical records, annual personnel performance reviews, income tax returns, etc.
* Protected A (Low-Sensitive protected information): designates low sensitivity information that should not be disclosed to the public without authorization and could reasonably be expected to cause injury or embarrassment outside the national interest. Example of Protected A information include employee identification number, pay deposit banking information, etc.

Federal Cabinet ([[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]]) papers are either protected (e.g., overhead slides prepared to make presentations to Cabinet) or classified (e.g., draft legislation, certain memos).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25487&amp;section=text=True |title=Archived - Access to Information Guidelines - Confidences of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada |work=Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat |year=2015 |accessdate=5 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017171415/http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25487&amp;section=text%3DTrue |archivedate=17 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Republic of China===
[[File:Wuhan Hubei foreign affairs office 4232.jpg|thumb|A building in [[Wuhan]] housing provincial offices for dealing with foreign countries etc. The red slogan says, "Protection of national secrets is a duty of every citizen".]]
The [[Criminal Law]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] (which is not operative in the Special Administrative Regions of [[#Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]) makes it a crime to release a state secret. Regulation and enforcement is carried out by the [[National Administration for the Protection of State Secrets]].

Under the 1989 "Law on Guarding State Secrets,"&lt;ref&gt;Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, "[http://www.gov.cn/banshi/2005-08/21/content_25096.htm Law on Guarding State Secrets]" (中华人民共和国保守国家秘密法), promulgated 1988 and effective 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; state secrets are defined as those that concern:

# Major policy decisions on state affairs
# The building of national defence and in the activities of the armed forces
# Diplomatic activities and in activities related to foreign countries and those to be maintained as commitments to foreign countries
# National economic and social development
# Science and technology
# Activities for preserving state security and the investigation of criminal offences
# Any other matters classified as "state secrets" by the national State Secrets Bureau&lt;ref name="prcssreport"&gt;Translation per Human Rights in China, ''[http://hrichina.org/public/contents/41421 State Secrets: China's Legal Labyrinth],'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Secrets can be classified into three categories:
* Top secret (绝密): defined as "vital state secrets whose disclosure would cause extremely serious harm to state security and national interests"
* Highly secret (机密): defined as "important state secrets whose disclosure would cause serious harm to state security and national interests"
* Secret (秘密): defined as "ordinary state secrets whose disclosure would cause harm to state security and national interests"&lt;ref name="prcssreport" /&gt;

===France===
In France, classified information is defined by article 413-9 of the Penal Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000020933029&amp;dateTexte=20150905 |title=Code pénal - Article 413-9 |work=Legifrance |year=2009 |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three levels of military classification are
* ''Très Secret Défense'' (Very Secret Defence): Information deemed extremely harmful to national defense,{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} and relative to governmental priorities in national defense. No service or organisation can elaborate, process, stock, transfer, display or destroy information or protected supports classified at this level without authorization from the Prime Minister or the national secretary for National Defence. Partial or exhaustive reproduction is strictly forbidden.
* ''Secret Défense'' (Secret Defence): Information deemed very harmful to national defense. Such information cannot be reproduced without authorisation from the emitting authority, except in exceptional emergencies.
* ''Confidentiel Défense'' (Confidential Defence): Information deemed potentially harmful to national defense, or that could lead to uncovering some information classified at a higher level of security.

Less sensitive information is "protected". The levels are
* ''Confidentiel personnels Officiers'' ("Confidential officers")
* ''Confidentiel personnels Sous-Officiers'' ("Confidential non-commissioned officers")
* ''Diffusion restreinte'' ("restricted information")
* ''Diffusion restreinte administrateur'' ("administrative restricted information")
* ''Non Protégé'' (unprotected)

A further caveat, "''spécial France''" (reserved France) restricts the document to French citizens (in its entirety or by extracts). This is not a classification level.

Declassification of documents can be done by the ''Commission consultative du secret de la défense nationale'' (CCSDN), an independent authority. Transfer of classified information is done with double envelopes, the outer layer being plastified and numbered, and the inner in strong paper. Reception of the document involves examination of the physical integrity of the container and registration of the document. In foreign countries, the document must be transferred through specialised military mail or [[diplomatic bag]]. Transport is done by an authorised convoyer or habilitated person for mail under 20&amp;nbsp;kg. The letter must bear a seal mentioning "''PAR VALISE ACCOMPAGNEE-SACOCHE''". Once a year, ministers have an inventory of classified information and supports by competent authorities.

Once their usage period is expired, documents are transferred to archives, where they are either destroyed (by incineration, crushing, or overvoltage), or stored.

In case of unauthorized release of classified information, competent authorities are the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Ministry of Interior]], the ''Haut fonctionnaire de défense et de sécurité'' ("high civil servant for defence and security") of the relevant ministry, and the General secretary for National Defence. Violation of such secrets is an offence punishable with 7 years of imprisonment and a 100,000 Euro fine; if the offence is committed by imprudence or negligence, the penalties are 3 years of imprisonment and a 45,000 Euro fine.

===Hong Kong===
The [[Security Bureau (Hong Kong)|Security Bureau]] is responsible for developing policies in regards to the protection and handling of confidential government information. In general, the system used in Hong Kong is very similar to the UK system, developed from the [[Colonial Hong Kong]] era.

Four classifications exists in Hong Kong, from highest to lowest in sensitivity:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csb.gov.hk/hkgcsb/doclib/general.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201013917/http://www.csb.gov.hk/hkgcsb/doclib/general.pdf|date=December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Top Secret (絕對機密)
* Secret (高度機密)
* Confidential (機密)
** Temporary Confidential (臨時保密)
* Restricted (限閱文件/內部文件)
** Restricted (staff) (限閱文件(人事))
** Restricted (tender) (限閱文件 (投標))
** Restricted (administration) (限閱文件 (行政))

Restricted documents are not classified ''per se'', but only those who have a need to know will have access to such information, in accordance with the ''Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hab.gov.hk/en/publications_and_press_releases/press_releases_speeches/equal_opportunities/191103q3.htm LCQ3: Equal Opportunities Commission] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227080400/http://www.hab.gov.hk/en/publications_and_press_releases/press_releases_speeches/equal_opportunities/191103q3.htm |date=December 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
[[New Zealand]] uses the Restricted classification, which is lower than Confidential.
People may be given access to Restricted information on the strength of an authorisation by their [[Head of Department]], without being subjected to the background [[vetting]] associated with Confidential, Secret and Top Secret clearances. New Zealand's security classifications and the national-harm requirements associated with their use are roughly similar to those of the [[United States]].

In addition to national security classifications there are two additional security classifications, In Confidence and Sensitive, which are used to protect information of a policy and privacy nature. There are also a number of information markings used within ministries and departments of the government, to indicate, for example, that information should not be released outside the originating ministry.

Because of strict privacy requirements around personal information, personnel files are controlled in all parts of the public and private sectors. Information relating to the security vetting of an individual is usually classified at the In Confidence level.

===Romania===
In [[Romania]], classified information is referred to as "state secrets" (''secrete de stat'') and is defined by the Penal Code as "documents and data that manifestly appear to have this status or have been declared or qualified as such by decision of Government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://legeaz.net/cod-penal-actualizat-2011/art-150-cpen | title=Penal Code of Romania, art. 150 | accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three levels of classification—Secret, Top Secret, and Top Secret of Particular Importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://legislatie.resurse-pentru-democratie.org/182_2002.php | title=Law no. 182/2002 on protection of classified information | accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The levels are set by the [[Romanian Intelligence Service]] and must be aligned with NATO regulations—in case of conflicting regulations, the latter are applied with priority. Dissemination of classified information to foreign agents or powers is punishable by up to life imprisonment, if such dissemination threatens Romania's national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://legeaz.net/cod-penal-actualizat-2011/art-157-cpen | title=Penal Code of Romania, art. 157 | accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KGB Regulation seen in Museum of Genocide Victims Vilnius.jpg|thumb|KGB Regulation seen in Museum of Genocide Victims Vilnius]]

===Russia===
{{main|Classified information in Russia}}

In the [[Russian Federation]], a state secret (Государственная тайна) is information protected by the state on its military, foreign policy, economic, intelligence, counterintelligence, operational and investigative and other activities, dissemination of which could harm state security.

===Sweden===
[[File:Hemligstamplar collage 02.jpeg|thumb|Some Swedish examples of markings attached to documents that are to be kept secret. A single frame around the text indicates ''Hemlig'', which can be equal to either Secret, Confidential or Restricted. Double frames means ''Kvalificerat hemlig'', that is, Top Secret.]]
The Swedish classification has been updated due to increased NATO/PfP cooperation. All classified defence documents will now have both a Swedish classification (''Kvalificerat hemlig'' or ''Hemlig''), and an English classification (Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, or Restricted).{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The term ''skyddad identitet'', "protected identity", is used in the case of protection of a threatened person, basically implying "secret identity", accessible only to certain members of the police force and explicitly authorised officials.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Government Security Classifications Policy.png|thumb|Security classifications in the UK]]
{{Main|Classified information in the United Kingdom}}
Until 2013, the [[United Kingdom]] used five levels of classification—from lowest to highest, they were: PROTECT, RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET and TOP SECRET (formerly MOST SECRET). The [[Cabinet Office]] provides guidance on how to protect information, including the [[Classified information in the United Kingdom#Security clearance|security clearances]] required for personnel. Staff may be required to sign to confirm their understanding and acceptance of the [[Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989]], although the Act applies regardless of signature. PROTECT is not in itself a security protective marking level (such as RESTRICTED or greater), but is used to indicate information which should not be disclosed because, for instance, the document contains tax, national insurance, or other personal information.

Government documents without a classification may be marked as UNCLASSIFIED or NOT PROTECTIVELY MARKED.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/spf/faqs.aspx |title=Understanding the Security Policy Framework &amp; frequently asked questions |publisher=Cabinet Office |date=1 April 2013 |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This system was replaced by the [[Government Security Classifications Policy]], which has a simpler model: TOP SECRET, SECRET, and OFFICIAL from April 2014.&lt;ref name=UK_Classifications/&gt; OFFICIAL SENSITIVE is a security marking which may be followed by one of three authorised descriptors: COMMERCIAL, LOCSEN (location sensitive) or PERSONAL. SECRET and TOP SECRET may include a caveat such as UK EYES ONLY.

===United States===
{{Main|Classified information in the United States}}
The U.S. classification system is currently established under [[Executive Order 13526]] and has three levels of classification—Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret. The U.S. had a Restricted level during [[World War II]] but no longer does. U.S. regulations state that information received from other countries at the Restricted level should be handled as Confidential. A variety of markings are used for material that is not classified, but whose distribution is limited administratively or by other laws, e.g., [[For Official Use Only]] (FOUO), or [[Sensitive but Unclassified]] (SBU). The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 provides for the protection of information related to the design of nuclear weapons. The term "Restricted Data" is used to denote certain nuclear technology. Information about the storage, use or handling of nuclear material or weapons is marked "Formerly Restricted Data". These designations are used in addition to level markings (Confidential, Secret and Top Secret). Information protected by the Atomic Energy Act is protected by law and information classified under the Executive Order is protected by Executive privilege.

The U.S. government insists it is "not appropriate" for a court to question whether any document is legally classified.&lt;ref name=JudRev&gt;
{{cite journal | last = Aftergood | first = Steven | author-link = Steven Aftergood | date = August 27, 2014 | title = Gov’t Resists Court Review of State Secrets | journal = Secrecy News | publisher = Federation of American Scientists | url = https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2014/08/review-state-secrets/ | accessdate = 2014-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Daniel Ellsberg#Trial and dismissal|1973 trial of Daniel Ellsberg for releasing the Pentagon Papers]], the judge did not allow any testimony from Ellsberg, claiming it was "irrelevant", because the assigned classification could not be challenged. The charges against Ellsberg were ultimately dismissed after it was revealed that the government had broken the law in secretly breaking into the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist and in tapping his telephone without a warrant. Ellsberg insists that the legal situation in the U.S. today is worse than it was in 1973, and [[Edward Snowden]] could not get a fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ellsberg | first = Daniel | author-link = Daniel Ellsberg | date = 30 May 2014 | title = Daniel Ellsberg: Snowden would not get a fair trial – and Kerry is wrong | newspaper = The Guardian | url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/30/daniel-ellsberg-snowden-fair-trial-kerry-espionage-act | accessdate = 2014-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[State Secrets Protection Act]] of 2008 might have given judges the authority to review such questions [[in camera]], but the bill was not passed.&lt;ref name=JudRev/&gt;

¹ In addition, Finland uses label ''Salassa pidettävä'', "to be kept secret" for information that is not classified but must not be revealed on some other basis than national security. (E.g. privacy, trade secrets etc.)

==Corporate classification==
Private [[corporation]]s often require written [[non-disclosure agreement|confidentiality agreements]] and conduct [[background check]]s on candidates for sensitive positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs16-bck.htm |title=Employment Background Checks: A Jobseeker's Guide &amp;#124; Privacy Rights Clearinghouse |publisher=Privacyrights.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. the [[Employee Polygraph Protection Act]] prohibits private employers from requiring lie detector tests, but there are a few exceptions. Policies dictating methods for marking and safeguarding company-sensitive information (e.g. "IBM Confidential") are common and some companies have more than one level. Such information is protected under [[trade secret]] laws. New product development teams are often sequestered and forbidden to share information about their efforts with un-cleared fellow employees, the original [[Apple Macintosh]] project being a famous example. Other activities, such as [[merger]]s and [[financial report]] preparation generally involve similar restrictions. However, corporate security generally lacks the elaborate hierarchical clearance and sensitivity structures and the harsh criminal sanctions that give government classification systems their particular tone.

==Traffic Light Protocol==
The [[Traffic Light Protocol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/25/10/40761118.pdf |title=Development of Policies for Protection of Critical Information Infrastructures |publisher=Cecd.ord |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&amp;m=122754275122010&amp;w=2 |title='Re: OpenSSH security advisory: cbc.adv' - MARC |publisher=Marc.info |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed by the [[Group of Eight]] countries to enable the sharing of sensitive information between government agencies and corporations. This protocol has now been accepted as a model for trusted information exchange by over 30 other countries. The protocol provides for four "information sharing levels" for the handling of sensitive information.

{{Paranormal}}
'''Cryptozoology''' is a [[pseudoscience]] and [[subculture]] that aims to prove the existence of entities from the [[folklore]] record, such as [[Bigfoot]], the [[chupacabra]], or [[Mokele-mbembe]]. Cryptozoologists refer to these entities as ''cryptids'', a term coined by the subculture. Because it does not follow the [[scientific method]], cryptozoology is considered a pseudoscience by the academic world: it is neither a branch of [[zoology]] nor [[folkloristics]].

Originally founded in the 1950s by zoologists [[Bernard Heuvelmans]] and [[Ivan T. Sanderson]], scholars have noted that the pseudoscience rejected mainstream approaches from an early date, and that adherents often express hostility to mainstream science. Scholars have studied cryptozoologists and their influence (including the pseudoscience's association with [[young Earth creationism]]), and have noted parallels in cryptozoology and other pseudosciences such as [[ghost hunting]] and [[ufology]].

==Terminology, history, and approach==
As a field, cryptozoology originates from  the works of colleagues Bernard Heuvelmans, a [[Belgian]] zoologist, and Ivan T. Sanderson, a Scottish zoologist. Notably, Heuvelmans published ''[[On the Track of Unknown Animals]]'' (French ''Sur la Piste des Bêtes Ignorées'') in 1955, a landmark work among cryptozoologists that was followed by numerous other like works. Similarly, Sanderson published a series of books that assisted in developing hallmarks of cryptozoology, including ''Abominable Snowmen: Legend Come to Life'' (1961).&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"&gt;Regal, Brian (2011) "Cryptozoology", pp. 326-329 as published in McCormick, Charlie T. and Kim Kennedy (2011). ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art''. 2nd edition. [[ABC-CLIO]]. {{ISBN|978-1-59884-241-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''cryptozoology'' dates from cryptozoologist circles from 1959 or before&amp;nbsp;– Heuvelmans attributes the coinage of the term ''cryptozoology'' ('the study of hidden animals') to Sanderson.&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OED-CRYPTOZOOLOGY"&gt;Additionally, see discussion at "cryptozoology, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 25 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Patterned after ''cryptozoology'', the term ''cryptid'' was coined in 1983 by cryptozoologist J. E. Wall in the Summer issue of the [[International Society of Cryptozoology]] newsletter.&lt;ref name="Regal2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Regal|first=B.|title=Searching for Sasquatch: Crackpots, Eggheads, and Cryptozoology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5a7GAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA197|date=11 April 2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-11829-4|pages=197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wall "[It has been] suggested that new terms be coined to replace sensational and often misleading terms like 'monster'. My suggestion is 'cryptid', meaning a living thing having the quality of being hidden or unknown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Wall |first=J.E. |title=The ISC Newsletter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSfXAAAAMAAJ |date=Summer 1982 |publisher=International Society of Cryptozoology |volume=2 |issue=2 |page=10 |quote=The Spring, 1983, issue featured an interview with Paul LeBlond and Forrest Wood, in which it was suggested that new terms be coined to replace sensational and often misleading terms like "monster." My suggestion is "cryptid," meaning a living thing having the quality of being hidden or unknown. As far as I know, this would be an entirely new word , describing those creatures which are (or may be) subjects of cryptozoological investigation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the noun ''cryptid'' as "an animal whose existence or survival to the present day is disputed or unsubstantiated; any animal of interest to a cryptozoologist".&lt;ref name="OED-CRYPTID"&gt;"cryptid, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 25 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; While used by most cryptozoologists, the term ''cryptid'' is not used by academic zoologists.&lt;ref name="PAXTON-2011"&gt;Paxton, C.G.M.  (2011). "Putting the “ology” into cryptozoology." . ''Biofortean Notes''. Vol. 7, pp. 7-20, 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

While biologists regularly identify new species, cryptozoologists often focus on creatures from the [[folklore]] record. Most famously, these include the [[Loch Ness Monster]], [[Bigfoot]], the [[chupacabra]], as well as other "imposing beasts that could be labeled as monsters". In their hunt for these entities, cryptozoologists may employ devices such as motion-sensitive cameras, night-vision equipment, and audio-recording equipment. While there have been attempts to codify cryptozoological approaches, unlike biologists, zoologists, botanists, and other academic disciplines, however, "there are no accepted, uniform, or successful methods for pursuing cryptids".&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"/&gt; Some scholars have identified precursors to modern cryptozoology in certain medieval approaches to the folklore record, and the psychology behind the cryptozoology approach has been the subject of academic study.&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"/&gt;

Few cryptozoologists have a formal science education, and fewer still have a science background directly relevant to cryptozoology. Adherents often misrepresent the academic backgrounds of cryptozoologists. According to writer [[Daniel Loxton]] and paleontologist [[Donald Prothero]], "Cryptozoologists have often promoted 'Professor [[Roy Mackal]], PhD.' as one of their leading figures and one of the few with a legitimate doctorate in biology. What is rarely mentioned, however, is that he had no training that would qualify him to undertake competent research on exotic animals. This raises the specter of 'credential mongering', by which an individual or organization feints a person's graduate degree as proof of expertise, even though his or her training is not specifically relevant to the field under consideration." Besides Heuvalmans, Sanderson, and Mackal, notable cryptozoologists with academic backgrounds include [[Grover Krantz]], [[Karl Shuker]], and [[Richard Greenwell]].&lt;ref name="LOXTON-PROTHERO-2013-304-305"&gt;Loxton, Daniel and Donald Prothero. 2013. ''Abominable Science: Origins of the Yeti, Nessie, and other Famous Cryptids'', p. 304-305. [[Columbia University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-231-52681-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Young Earth creationism===
A subset of cryptozoology promotes the pseudoscience of [[Young Earth creationism]], rejecting conventional science in favor of a Biblical interpretation and promoting concepts such as "[[Young Earth creationism#Flood geology, the fossil record, and dinosaurs|living dinosaur]]s". [[Science journalism|Science writer]] [[Sharon A. Hill]] observes that the Young Earth creationist segment of cryptozoology is "well-funded and able to conduct expeditions with a goal of finding a living dinosaur that they think would invalidate evolution."&lt;ref name="SCIENTIFICAL-AMERICANS-66"&gt;Hill, Sharon A. 2017. ''Scientifical Americans: The Culture of Amateur Paranormal Researchers'', pp. 66. [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]]. {{ISBN|9781476630823}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] Jeb J. Card says that "Creationists have embraced cryptozoology and some cryptozoological expeditions are funded by and conducted by creationists hoping to disprove evolution."&lt;ref name="CARD-32"&gt;Card, Jeb J. 2016. "Steampunk Inquiry: A Comparative Vivisection of Discovery Pseudoscience" in Card, Jeb J. and Anderson, David S. ''Lost City, Found Pyramid: Understanding Alternative Archaeologies and Pseudoscientific Practices'', p. 32. [[University of Alabama Press]]. {{ISBN|9780817319113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 interview, [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Donald Prothero]] notes an uptick in creationist cryptozoologists. He observes that "[p]eople who actively search for Loch Ness monsters or Mokele Mbembe do it entirely as creationist ministers. They think that if they found a dinosaur in the Congo it would overturn all of evolution. It wouldn't. It would just be a late-occurring dinosaur, but that's their mistaken notion of evolution."&lt;ref name="NAT-GEO-PROTHERO"&gt;Shea, Rachel Hartigan. 2013. "The Science Behind Bigfoot and Other Monsters".''[[National Geographic]]'', September 9, 2013. [https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/09/130907-cryptid-crytozoology-bigfoot-loch-yeti-monster-abominable-science/ Online].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and pseudoscience==
The 2003 discovery of the [[fossil]] remains of ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'' was cited by paleontologist [[Henry Gee]], a senior editor at the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', as possible evidence that "in geological terms, makes it more likely that stories of other mythical, human-like creatures such as yetis are founded on grains of truth." "Cryptozoology," Gee says, "can come in from the cold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Henry Gee |year=2004 |journal=Nature News |url=http://www.bioedonline.org/news/news.cfm?art=1329 |title=Flores, God and Cryptozoology: The discovery poses thorny questions about the uniqueness of Homo sapiens | doi = 10.1038/news041025-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, cryptozoology is widely criticised for an array of reasons and is rejected by the academic world. There is a broad consensus from academics that cryptozoology is a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Jeffrey A. (2000). ''The Scientific Endeavor: A Primer on Scientific Principles and Practice''. [[Benjamin Cummings]]. p. 119. {{ISBN|978-0805345964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roesch, Ben S; Moore, John L. (2002). ''Cryptozoology''. In [[Michael Shermer]]. ''The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: Volume One''. ABC-CLIO. pp. 71-78. {{ISBN|1-57607-653-9}} "Pointing to this rampant speculation and ignorance of established scientific theories in cryptozoology, as well as the field's poor record of success and its reliance on unsystematic, anecdotal evidence, many scientists and skeptics classify cryptozoology as a pseudoscience."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Church, Jill M. (2009). ''Cryptozoology''. In [[H. James Birx]]. ''Encyclopedia of Time: Science, Philosophy, Theology &amp; Culture, Volume 1''. [[SAGE Publications]]. pp. 251-252. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-4164-8}} "Cryptozoology has acquired a bad reputation as a pseudoscience... Until detailed, methodical research becomes standard practice among cryptozoologists, the field will remain disrespected by more traditional biologists and zoologists."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lack, Caleb W; Rousseau, Jacques. (2016). ''Unknown Animals and Cryptozoology''. In ''Critical Thinking, Science and Pseudoscience: Why We Can't Trust Our Brains.'' [[Springer Publishing]]. pp. 153-174. {{ISBN|978-0-8261-9419-0}} "Cryptids are the focus of study in cryptozoology, a field most scientists label as pseudoscientific."&lt;/ref&gt; The field is regularly criticized for reliance on anecdotal information&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shermer|first=Michael| authorlink=Michael Shermer | year=2003|title=Show Me the Body|work=[[Scientific American]]|issue=288 (5)|page=27|url=http://www.michaelshermer.com/2003/05/show-me-the-body}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because in the course of investigating animals that most scientists believe are unlikely to have existed, cryptozoologists do not follow the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="luumsh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dash|first=Mike|title=Borderlands: The Ultimate Exploration of the Unknown|publisher=[[Overlook Press]]|year=2000 |isbn=0-440-23656-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill notes that "there is no academic course of study in cryptozoology or no university degree program that will bestow the title 'cryptozoologist'."&lt;ref name="SCIENTIFICAL-AMERICANS-66"/&gt;

Anthropologist Jeb J. Card summarizes cryptozoology in a survey of pseudoscience and [[pseudoarchaeology]]:

:Cryptozoology purports to be the study of previously unidentified animal species. At first glance, this would seem to differ little from zoology. New species are discovered by field and museum zoologists every year. Cryptozoologists cite these discoveries as justification of their search but often minimize or omit the fact that the discoverers do not identify as cryptozoologists and are academically trained zoologists working in an ecological paradigm rather than organizing expeditions to seek out supposed examples of unusual and large creatures.&lt;ref name="CARD-23-32"&gt;Card, Jeb J. 2016. "Steampunk Inquiry: A Comparative Vivisection of Discovery Pseudoscience" in Card, Jeb J. and Anderson, David S. ''Lost City, Found Pyramid: Understanding Alternative Archaeologies and Pseudoscientific Practices'', p. 23-32. [[University of Alabama Press]]. {{ISBN|9780817319113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Card notes that "cryptozoologists often show their disdain and even hatred for professional scientists, including those who enthusiastically participated in cryptozoology", which he traces back to Heuvelmans's early "rage against critics of cryptozoology". He finds parallels with cryptozoology and other pseudosciences, such as [[ghost hunting]] and [[ufology]], and compares the approach of cryptozoologists to colonial big-game hunters, and to aspects of European imperialism. According to Card, "Most cryptids are framed as the subject of indigenous legends typically collected in the hayday of [[comparative folklore]], though such legends may be heavily modified or worse. Cryptozoology's complicated mix of sympathy, interest, and appropriation of indigenous culture (or non-indigenous construction of it) is also found in [[New Age]] circles and dubious "[[Indian burial grounds]]" and other [[legend]]s ... invoked in [[haunting]]s such as the [[The Amityville Horror|"Amityville" hoax]] ...".&lt;ref name="CARD-24-25"&gt;Card, Jeb J. 2016. "Steampunk Inquiry: A Comparative Vivisection of Discovery Pseudoscience" in Card, Jeb J. and Anderson, David S. ''Lost City, Found Pyramid: Understanding Alternative Archaeologies and Pseudoscientific Practices'', p. 24-25. [[University of Alabama Press]]. {{ISBN|9780817319113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 foreword for ''The American Biology Teacher'', then [[National Association of Biology Teachers]] president [[Dan Ward (educator)|Dan Ward]] uses cryptozoology as an example of "technological pseudoscience" that may confuse students about the scientific method. Ward says that "Cryptozoology … is not valid science or even science at all. It is monster hunting."&lt;ref name="WARD-2011"&gt;Ward, Daniel. 2011. “From the President”. The American Biology Teacher 73.8 (2011): 440–440.&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of science|Historian of science]] [[Brian Regal]] includes an entry for cryptozoology in his ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia'' (2009). Regal says that "as an intellectual endeavor, cryptozoology has been studied as much as cryptozoologists have sought hidden animals".&lt;ref name="NAGEL-50"&gt;Nagel, Brian. 2009. ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia'', p. 50. [[ABC-CLIO]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1992 issue of ''[[The Folklore Society|Folklore]]'', [[folkloristics|folklorist]] Véronique Campion-Vincent says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Unexplained appearances of mystery animals are reported all over the world today. Beliefs in the existence of fabulous and supernatural animals are ubiquitous and timeless. In the continents discovered by Europe indigenous beliefs and tales have strongly influenced the perceptions of the conquered confronted by a new natural environment. In parallel with the growing importance of the scientific approach, these traditional mythical tales have been endowed with sometimes highly artificial precision and have given birth to contemporary legends solidly entrenched in their territories. The belief self-perpetuates today through multiple observations enhanced by the media and encouraged (largely with the aim of gain for touristic promotion) by the local population, often genuinely convinced of the reality of this profitable phenomenon."&lt;ref name="CAMPION-VINCENT-173"&gt;Campion-Vincent, Véronique. 1992. “Appearances of Beasts and Mystery-cats in France”. ''Folklore'' 103.2 (1992): 160–183.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Campion-Vincent says that "four currents can be distinguished in the study of mysterious animal appearances": "Forteans" ("compiler[s] of anomalies" such as via publications like the ''[[Fortean Times]]''), "occultists" (which she describes as related to "Forteans"), "folklorists", and "cryptozoologists". Regarding cryptozoologists, Campion-Vincent says that "this movement seems to deserve the appellation of parascience, like [[parapsychology]]: the same corpus is reviewed; many scientists participate, but for those who have an official status of university professor or researcher, the participation is a private hobby".&lt;ref name="CAMPION-VINCENT-173"/&gt;

In her ''Encyclopedia of American Folklore'', academic [[Linda Watts]] says that "folklore concerning unreal animals or beings, sometimes called monsters, is a popular field of inquiry" and describes cryptozoology as an example of "American narrative traditions" that "feature many monsters".&lt;ref name="WATTS-271"&gt;Watts, Linda S. 2007. ''Encyclopedia of American Folklore'', p. 271. [[Facts on File]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his analysis of cryptozoology, folklorist [[Peter Dendle]] says that "cryptozoology devotees consciously position themselves in defiance of mainstream science" and that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:The psychological significance of cryptozoology in the modern world .. serves to channel guilt over the decimation of species and destruction of the natural habitat; to recapture a sense of mysticism and danger in a world now perceived as fully charted and over-explored; and to articulate resentment of and defiance against a scientific community perceived as monopolising the pool of culturally acceptable beliefs.&lt;ref name="DENDLE-2006-190-206"&gt;Dendle, Peter. 2006. "Cryptozoology in the Medieval and Modern Worlds". ''Folklore'', Vol. 117, No. 2 (Aug., 2006), pp. 190-206. [[Taylor &amp; Francis]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a paper published in 2013, Dendle refers to cryptozoologists as "contemporary monster hunters" that "keep alive a sense of wonder in a world that has been very thoroughly charted, mapped, and tracked, and that is largely available for close scrutiny on Google Earth and satellite imaging" and that "on the whole the devotion of substantial resources for this pursuit betrays a lack of awareness of the basis for scholarly consensus (largely ignoring, for instance, evidence of evolutionary biology and the fossil record)."&lt;ref name="DENDLE-2013-439"&gt;Dendle, Peter. 2013. "Monsters and the Twenty-First Century" as published in ''The Ashgate Research Companion to Monsters and the Monstrous''. [[Ashgate Publishing]]. {{ISBN|9781472418012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Mike Dash]], few scientists doubt there are thousands of unknown animals, particularly invertebrates, awaiting discovery; however, cryptozoologists are largely uninterested in researching and cataloging newly discovered species of [[ant]]s or [[beetle]]s, instead focusing their efforts towards "more elusive" creatures that have often defied decades of work aimed at confirming their existence.&lt;ref name="luumsh"/&gt;

Paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]] (1984) lists cryptozoology among examples of human gullibility, along with [[creationism]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Humans are the most inventive, deceptive, and gullible of all animals. Only those characteristics can explain the belief of some humans in creationism, in the arrival of UFO's with extraterrestrial beings, or in some aspects of cryptozoology. … In several respects the discussion and practice of cryptozoology sometimes, although not invariably, has demonstrated both deception and gullibility. An example seems to merit the old Latin saying 'I believe because it is incredible,' although Tertullian, its author, applied it in a way more applicable to the present day creationists.&lt;ref name="SIMPSON-1984-1-16"&gt;Simpson, George Gaylord (1984). "Mammals and Cryptozoology". ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society''. Vol. 128, No. 1 (Mar. 30, 1984), pp. 1-19. [[American Philosophical Society]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paleontologist Donald Prothero (2007) cites cryptozoology as an example of pseudoscience, and categorizes it along with [[Holocaust denial]] and [[Ufology#As a pseudoscience|UFO abductions claims]] as aspects of American culture that are "clearly baloney".&lt;ref name="PROTHERO-2007"&gt;[[Donald R. Prothero|Prothero, Donald R.]]. 2007. ''Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters'', pp. 13-15. [[Columbia University Press]]. {{ISBN|9780231511421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Scientifical Americans: The Culture of Amateur Paranormal Researchers'' (2017), Hill surveys the field and discusses aspects of the subculture, noting internal attempts at creating more scientific approaches and the involvement of [[Young Earth creationists]] and a prevalence of hoaxes. She concludes that many cryptozoologists are "passionate and sincere in their belief that mystery animals exist. As such, they give deference to every report of a sighting, often without criticial questioning. As with the [[ghost hunting|ghost seekers]], cryptozoologists are convinced that they will be the ones to solve the mystery and make history. With the lure of mystery and money undermining diligent and ethical research, the field of cryptozoology has serious credibility problems."&lt;ref name="SCIENTIFICAL-AMERICANS-56-68"&gt;Hill, Sharon A. 2017. ''Scientifical Americans: The Culture of Amateur Paranormal Researchers'', pp. 56-68. [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]]. {{ISBN|9781476630823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Political corruption sidebar}}
'''Electoral fraud''', sometimes referred to as '''election manipulation''' or '''vote rigging,''' is illegal interference with the process of an [[election]], either by increasing the vote share of the favored candidate, depressing the vote share of the rival candidates, or both. What exactly constitutes electoral fraud varies from country to country.

Many kinds of election fraud are outlawed in electoral legislation, but others are in violation of general laws, such as those banning [[assault]], [[harassment]] or [[libel]]. Although technically the term 'electoral fraud' covers only those acts which are illegal, the term is sometimes used to describe acts which are legal, but considered morally unacceptable, outside the spirit of an election or in violation of the principles of democracy.&lt;ref name="Myagkov"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-76470-4| last = Myagkov| first = Mikhail G.|author2=Peter C. Ordeshook |author3=Dimitri Shakin | title = The Forensics of Election Fraud: Russia and Ukraine| date = 2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alvarez"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Michael |last1=Alvarez |first2=Thad | last2=Hall | first3=Susan | last3=Hyde |year=2008 |title=Election Fraud: Detecting and Deterring Electoral Manipulation}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Show election]]s, containing only one candidate, are sometimes classified as electoral fraud, although they may comply with the law and are presented more as referendums.

In national elections, successful electoral fraud can have the effect of a [[coup d'état]] or corruption of democracy. In a [[List of narrow elections|narrow election]], a small amount of fraud may be enough to change the result. Even if the outcome is not affected, the revelation of fraud can have a damaging effect, if not punished, as it can reduce voters' confidence in [[democracy]].

==Specific methods==
{{Elections}}
A list of threats to voting systems, or electoral fraud methods considered as sabotage are kept by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vote.nist.gov/threats/papers.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021021000/http://vote.nist.gov/threats/papers.htm|date=October 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electorate manipulation===
Electoral fraud can occur in advance of voting if the composition of the electorate is altered. The legality of this type of manipulation varies across jurisdictions. Deliberate manipulation of election outcomes is widely considered a violation of the principles of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nvri.org/about/new_york_state_policies.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111172709/http://www.nvri.org/about/new_york_state_policies.shtml|date=November 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Manipulation of demography====
In many cases, it is possible for authorities to artificially control the composition of an electorate in order to produce a foregone result. One way of doing this is to move a large number of voters into the electorate prior to an election, for example by temporarily assigning them land or lodging them in [[flophouse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries prevent this with rules stipulating that a voter must have lived in an electoral district for a minimum period (for example, six months) in order to be eligible to vote there. However, such laws can also be used for demographic manipulation as they tend to [[disenfranchise]] those with no fixed address, such as the homeless, travelers, [[Romani people|Roma]], students (studying full-time away from home), and some casual workers.

Another strategy is to permanently move people into an electoral district, usually through [[public housing]]. If people eligible for public housing are likely to vote for a particular party, then they can either be concentrated into one area, thus making their votes count for less, or moved into [[marginal electorate]]s, where they may tip the balance towards their preferred party. One notable example of this occurred in the [[City of Westminster]] in England under [[Shirley Porter]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldjudgmt/jd011213/magill-2.htm Magill v. Porter Magill v. Weeks]'', H=House of Lords Judgments, 13 December 2001. Accessed 2012-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration law may also be used to manipulate electoral demography. For instance, [[Malaysia]] gave citizenship to immigrants from the neighboring [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], together with suffrage, in order for a political party to "dominate" the state of [[Sabah]]; this controversial process was known as [[Project IC]].&lt;ref name=Sadiq&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sadiq |first=Kamal |year=2005 |title=When States Prefer Non-Citizens Over Citizens: Conflict Over Illegal Immigration into Malaysia |format=PDF |journal=International Studies Quarterly |volume=49 |issue= |pages=101–22 |id= |url=http://www.cri.uci.edu/pdf/ISQ2005FinalCopy.pdf |accessdate=2008-04-23 |quote= |doi=10.1111/j.0020-8833.2005.00336.x |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080614044317/http://www.cri.uci.edu/pdf/ISQ2005FinalCopy.pdf |archivedate=2008-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A method of manipulating [[primary election|primary contests]] and other elections of party leaders are related to this. People who support one party may temporarily join another party (or vote in a crossover way, when permitted) in order to elect a weak candidate for that party's leadership. The goal ultimately is to defeat the weak candidate in the general election by the leader of the party that the voter truly supports. There were claims that this method was being utilised in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2015|UK Labour Party leadership election in 2015]], where Conservative-leaning [[Toby Young]] encouraged [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] to join [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and vote for [[Jeremy Corbyn]] in order to "consign Labour to electoral oblivion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/politics-blog/11680016/Why-Tories-should-join-Labour-and-back-Jeremy-Corbyn.html|title=Why Tories should join Labour and back Jeremy Corbyn|first=Toby|last=Young|date=17 June 2015|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2015/06/labours-response-to-toriesforcorbyn-shows-they-really-have-lost-the-plot/|title=Labour’s response to #ToriesForCorbyn shows they really have lost the plot - Coffee House|date=24 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, #ToriesForCorbyn [[Trending topics|trended]] on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/06/labours-response-to-toriesforcorbyn-shows-they-really-have-lost-the-plot/|title=Labour’s response to #ToriesForCorbyn shows they really have lost the plot - Coffee House|date=24 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Disenfranchisement====
The composition of an electorate may also be altered by [[disenfranchising]] some classes of people, rendering them unable to vote. In some cases, states have passed provisions that raised general barriers to voter registration, such as poll taxes, literacy and comprehension tests, and record-keeping requirements, which in practice were applied against minority populations to discriminatory effect. From the turn of the century into the late 1960s, most African Americans in the southern states of the former Confederacy were disenfranchised by such measures. Corrupt election officials may misuse voting regulations such as a literacy test or requirement for proof of identity or address in such a way as to make it difficult or impossible for their targets to cast a vote. If such practices discriminate against a religious or ethnic group, they may so distort the political process that the political order becomes grossly unrepresentative, as in the post-[[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] or [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] era until the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].

Groups may also be disenfranchised by rules which make it impractical or impossible for them to cast a vote. For example, requiring people to vote within their electorate may disenfranchise serving military personnel, prison inmates, students, hospital patients or anyone else who cannot return to their homes.{{examples|date=May 2017}} Polling can be set for inconvenient days, such as midweek or on holy days of religious groups: for example on [[Shabbat|the Sabbath]] or other [[Liturgical year|holy days]] of a religious group whose teachings determine that voting is a prohibited on such a day. Communities may also be effectively disenfranchised if polling places are situated in areas perceived by voters as unsafe, or are not provided within reasonable proximity (rural communities are especially vulnerable to this){{examples|date=April 2017}}.

In some cases, voters may be invalidly disenfranchised, which is true electoral fraud. For example, a legitimate voter may be “accidentally” removed from the electoral roll, making it difficult or impossible for the person to vote.

In the Canadian federal election of 1917, during the [[World War I|Great War]], the Union government passed the [[Military Voters Act]] and the [[Wartime Elections Act]]. The Military Voters Act permitted any active military personnel to vote by party only and allowed that party to decide in which electoral district to place that vote. It also enfranchised those women who were directly related or married to an active soldier. These groups were believed to be disproportionately in favor of the Union government, as that party was campaigning in favor of conscription.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} The Wartime Elections Act, conversely, disenfranchised particular ethnic groups assumed to be disproportionately in favour of the opposition Liberal Party.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;!-- how? --&gt;

====Division of opposition support====
Stanford University professor Beatriz Magaloni described a model governing the behaviour of autocratic regimes. She proposed that ruling parties can maintain political control under a democratic system without actively manipulating votes or coercing the electorate. Under the right conditions, the democratic system is manouvered into an equilibrium  in which divided opposition parties act as unwitting accomplices to single-party rule. This permits the ruling regime to abstain from illegal electoral fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Magaloni |first=Beatriz |title= Autocratic Elections, Voters, and the Game of Fraud |url= http://www.yale.edu/macmillan/ruleoflaw/papers/Magaloni.pdf |website=Yale University |accessdate= 10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preferential voting systems such as [[score voting]], [[instant-runoff voting]], and [[single transferable vote]] are designed to prevent systemic electoral manipulation and [[Two-party system|political duopoly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_24bJHyBV6sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Gaming%20the%20Vote%3A%20Why%20elections%20Aren't%20Fair&amp;pg=PA170#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=fa| title=Gaming the Vote: Why Elections Aren't Fair (And What We Can Do About It) | publisher=Macmillan | author=Poundstone, William | year=2009 | page=170 | isbn=9780809048922}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703864204576321171406816538 | title=Latest Issue on the Ballot: How to Hold a Vote | work=Wall Street Journal | date=May 14, 2011 | accessdate=June 29, 2012 | author=Bialik, Carl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intimidation ===
Voter intimidation involves putting undue pressure on a voter or group of voters so that they will vote a particular way, or not at all. [[Absentee voting|Absentee]] and other [[Postal voting|remote voting]] can be more open to some forms of intimidation as the voter does not have the protection and privacy of the polling location. Intimidation can take a range of forms including verbal, physical, or coercion. This was so common that in 1887, a Kansas Supreme Court in ''New Perspectives on Election Fraud in The Gilded Age'' said “[…] physical retaliation constituted only a slight disturbance and would not vitiate an election.”

* '''Violence or the threat of violence''': In its simplest form, voters from a particular demographic or known to support a particular party or candidate are directly threatened by supporters of another party or candidate or by those hired by them. In other cases, supporters of a particular party make it known that if a particular village or neighborhood is found to have voted the 'wrong' way, reprisals will be made against that community. Another method is to make a general threat of violence, for example, a [[bomb threat]] which has the effect of closing a particular polling place, thus making it difficult for people in that area to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madison.com/tct/news/index.php?ntid=106590&amp;ntpid=12 |title=Did bomb threat stifle vote? (Capital Times) |publisher=Madison.com |accessdate=2012-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304173104/http://www.madison.com/tct/news/index.php?ntid=106590&amp;ntpid=12 |archivedate=March 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable example of outright violence was the [[1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack]], where followers of [[Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh]] deliberately contaminated salad bars in [[The Dalles, Oregon]], in an attempt to weaken political opposition during county elections.
* '''Attacks on polling places''': Polling places in an area known to support a particular party or candidate may be targeted for vandalism, destruction or threats, thus making it difficult or impossible for people in that area to vote.
* '''Legal threats''': In this case, voters will be made to believe, accurately or otherwise, that they are not legally entitled to vote, or that they are legally obliged to vote a particular way. Voters who are not confident about their entitlement to vote may also be intimidated by real or implied authority figures who suggest that those who vote when they are not entitled to will be imprisoned, deported or otherwise punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6D91638F932A25752C1A965958260 |title= Florio's Defeat Revives Memories of G.O.P.

Also, "If anybody in your family has ever been found guilty of anything you can’t vote in the Presidential Election." Finally, "If you violate any of these laws, you can get 10 years in prison and your children will be taken away from you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ep365.org/site/c.fnKGIMNtEoG/b.2052599/k.6FF4/Intimidation_and_Deceptive_Practices.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121190107/http://www.ep365.org/site/c.fnKGIMNtEoG/b.2052599/k.6FF4/Intimidation_and_Deceptive_Practices.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-01-21 |title=Intimidation and Deceptive Practices EP365 |date= |accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ac4vr.com/reports/072005/republicanincidents.html |title=Incidents Of Voter Intimidation &amp; Suppression |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2006-11-08 |accessdate=2012-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404073205/http://www.ac4vr.com/reports/072005/republicanincidents.html |archivedate=April 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method, allegedly used in [[Cook County, Illinois]] in 2004, is to falsely tell particular people that they are not eligible to vote.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.ep365.org/site/c.fnKGIMNtEoG/b.2052599/k.6FF4/Intimidation_and_Deceptive_Practices.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026234525/http://www.ep365.org/site/c.fnKGIMNtEoG/b.2052599/k.6FF4/Intimidation_and_Deceptive_Practices.htm|date=October 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Coercion''': The demographic that controlled the voting ballot would try to persuade others to follow them. By singling out those who were against the majority, people would attempt to switch the voters' decision. Their argument could be that since the majority sides with a certain candidate, they should admit defeat and join the winning side. If this didn't work, this led to the threatening of violence seen countless times during elections. Coercion, electoral intimidation was seen in the Navy. In 1885 William C. Whitney started an investigation that involved the men in the Navy. As said by Whitney "the vote of the yard was practically coerced and controlled by the foremen. This instance shows how even in the Navy there were still instances of people going to great lengths for the desired elective to win.

===Vote buying{{anchor|Vote buying}}&lt;!--[[Electoral bribery]] redirects here--&gt;===
Vote buying occurs when a political party or candidate seeks to buy the vote of a voter in an upcoming election. Vote buying can take various forms such as a monetary exchange, as well as an exchange for necessary goods or services.&lt;ref name="rienner.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rienner.com/title/Elections_for_Sale_The_Causes_and_Consequences_of_Vote_Buying|title=Lynne Rienner Publishers - Elections for Sale The Causes and Consequences of Vote Buying|website=www.rienner.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is often used to incentivise or persuade voters to turn out to elections and vote in a particular way. Despite the fact that this practice is illegal in many countries such as the United States, Argentina, Mexico, Kenya and Nigeria, its prevalence remains worldwide.

In some parts of the United States{{Which|date=June 2018}} in the mid- and late 19th century, members of competing parties would vie, sometimes openly and other times with much greater secrecy, to buy and sell votes. Voters would be compensated with cash or the covering of one’s house/tax payment. To keep the practice of vote buying secret, parties would open fully staffed vote-buying shops.&lt;ref name="Wahlgren"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Wahlgren Summers |title=Party Games: Getting, Keeping, and Using Power in Gilded Age Politics: Mark Wahlgren Summers: 9780807855379 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parties would also hire runners, who would go out into the public and find floating voters and bargain with them to vote for their side.&lt;ref name="Wahlgren" /&gt;

In England, documentation and stories of vote buying and vote selling are also well known. The most famous episodes of vote buying came in 18th century England when two or more rich aristocrats spent whatever money it took to win. The notorious "Spendthrift election" came in [[Northamptonshire]] in 1768, when three earls spent over ₤100,000 each to win a seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z8QNwwkg784C&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq=spendthrift+election%22+came+in+Northamptonshire+in+1768,#v=onepage&amp;q=spendthrift%20election%22%20came%20in%20Northamptonshire%20in%201768%2C&amp;f=false |title=A History of Parliamentary Elections and Electioneering in the Old Days .. |author= Joseph Grego |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-29|year=1886 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Voters may be given money or other rewards for voting in a particular way, or not voting. In some jurisdictions, the offer or giving of other rewards is referred to as "electoral treating".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/peaea1912382/s149.html |title=Parliamentary Electorates And Elections Act 1912 – Section 149, New South Wales Consolidated Acts |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |accessdate=2012-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130180105/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/peaea1912382/s149.html |archive-date=2011-11-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Electoral [[treating]] remains legal in some jurisdictions, such as in the [[Seneca Nation of New York|Seneca Nation of Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbeck, Dan (November 15, 2011).

===== Latin America =====

====== Argentina ======
Vote buying and the overall practice of clientelism is widespread in Argentina. One of the main perpetrators of these illegal activities were the Peronist party.&lt;ref name="Nichter2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0003055408080106 |jstor=27644495 |title=Vote Buying or Turnout Buying? Machine Politics and the Secret Ballot |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=102 |pages=19 |year=2008 |last1=Nichter |first1=Simeon }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between voters and Peronist candidates are such that voters are offered particular goods, services, favours or monetary compensation in exchange for their political support for the party. These rewards could include a job, medicine, a roof, clothing, foods, and other goods or services. The case of Argentina in particular in that it relies heavily on face-to-face and day-to-day interactions between "brokers" who act as middlemen and voters.&lt;ref name="Brusco et al 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/lar.2004.0022 |title=Vote Buying in Argentina |journal=Latin American Research Review |volume=39 |issue=2 |page=66 |year=2004 |last1=Brusco |first1=Valeria |last2=Nazareno |first2=Marcelo |last3=Stokes |first3=Susan Carol }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since many of the communities in Argentina are ridden with poverty and are in need of these particular resources, it is these communities that have proven to be the demographic that were targeted for voted buying. Additionally, vote buying in this region focuses on citizens who are not strongly in favour or opposed to the political machine, and whose political loyalty does not necessarily lie with one party or another.&lt;ref name=Stokes2005&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0003055405051683 |title=Perverse Accountability: A Formal Model of Machine Politics with Evidence from Argentina |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=99 |issue=3 |page=315 |year=2005 |last1=Stokes |first1=Susan C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, vote buying acts as a mechanism to sway the decisions of weakly opposed voters. In a study done by Susan C. Stokes, she finds that the brokers in these communities are known to all the citizens and have access to the necessary resources from the municipality. They maintain relationships with the voters and grant them rewards and favours continuously in order to keep the party they work for in the office. This is one main explanation for why many lower-income voters are seen voting for populist leaders, as well as authoritarian ones.&lt;ref name=Stokes2005/&gt; Many citizens view these brokers as positive pillars in their lives and have the utmost respect for the help they distribute. However, others view them as hands of corruption. Stokes further explains that the capacity of these brokers is constrained due to the fact that they can only maintain this type of transactional relationship with a limited number of voters.&lt;ref name=Stokes2005/&gt; Furthermore, the brokers have the additional responsibility of maintaining trusting and solid relationships with their resource suppliers. Without these strong ties, they will have no means through which to carry out vote-buying practices.&lt;ref name="Brusco et al 2004"/&gt;

====== Mexico ======
Similarly to Argentina, it has been found that vote-buying in Mexico is most likely in rural and poor regions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10611-010-9260-7 |title=Vote-buying crime reports in Mexico: Magnitude and correlates |journal=Crime, Law, and Social Change |volume=54 |issue=5 |page=325 |year=2010 |last1=Vilalta |first1=Carlos }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many instances of vote buying that have occurred in the history of Mexican elections, however, there are two main instances of fund in the literature that occurred in the last two decades. The first was the 2006 Mexican election, where it was found that 8.8% of the population that was not a beneficiary of a specific social program was offered compensation for their vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/jpla/article/viewArticle/942|title=Vote Buying with Illegal Resources: Manifestation of a Weak Rule of Law in Mexico|first=Gilles|last=Serra|date=10 May 2016|publisher=|journal=Journal of Politics in Latin America|volume=8|issue=1|pages=129–150|via=journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a corruption inquiry arrested [[Andrés Granier Melo]] for embezzlement of funds in the state of [[Tabasco]] during his governorship: among other things, some of these funds were used for vote-buying (although Melo has denied all accusations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/jpla/article/view/942|title=Vote Buying with Illegal Resources: Manifestation of a Weak Rule of Law in Mexico|first=Gilles|last=Serra|date=10 May 2016|publisher=|journal=Journal of Politics in Latin America|volume=8|issue=1|pages=129–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Africa =====

====== Nigeria ======
On a self-reported survey that was conducted, 1 in 5 Nigerian has experienced an offer for their vote. The rewards offered by Nigerian politicians include money, commodities such as food and clothing, or a job.&lt;ref name="Bratton2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bratton|first1=Michael|year=2008|title=Vote buying and violence in Nigerian election campaigns|journal=Electoral Studies|volume=27|issue=4|page=621|doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2008.04.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the practice of vote buying is widespread, 58% of Nigerians surveyed at the time of the 2007 election viewed vote buying as immoral.&lt;ref name=Bratton2008/&gt; Despite this, when asked if they thought it was wrong to accept rewards or monetary compensation for your vote, 78% said no.&lt;ref name=Bratton2008/&gt; One factor that needs to be iterated when it comes to studies that are based on surveys is that since vote buying is illegal in most countries, a researcher’s ability to collect accurate data is hindered. This is because many citizens may not feel comfortable revealing their experience or involvement with corrupt activities, or fear that they will suffer repercussions from their governments for coming forward with such information.&lt;ref name=Bratton2008/&gt;

====== Kenya ======
Since the 1990s, Kenya has had regular multiparty elections in which vote buying has played a central role. In his article, scholar Eric Kramon states that: "According to the data gathered by the Coalition for Accountable Political Finance in Kenya, cash handouts to voters represents around 40% of the average parliamentary candidates’ campaign budget, making up the largest budget item."&lt;ref name=Kramon2016&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2016.09.006 |title=Where is vote buying effective? Evidence from a list experiment in Kenya |journal=Electoral Studies |volume=44 |page=397 |year=2016 |last1=Kramon |first1=Eric }}&lt;/ref&gt; These handouts are made in various ways including stops on the campaign trail, and at-large campaign rallies. "In the 2002 election, 40% of surveyed adult Kenyans reported having accepted a bribe in exchange for their vote, and 22% for the 2007 elections.”&lt;ref name=Kramon2016/&gt;

It is noted by Kramen that access to information is a huge factor in determining the success of vote buying in Kenya. If the voters have little access to political information or lack political knowledge then they are more likely to be swayed by clientelistic reasoning.&lt;ref name=Kramon2016/&gt; Moreover, if the voter does have access to information about an incumbent, then the price to sway their vote is more likely to go up. Additionally, Kramon notes that citizens of Kenya tend to value candidates who provide rewards because their ability to do so points to how great their abilities will be once they are in office.&lt;ref name=Kramon2016/&gt;

==== Considerations ====

===== Who to target =====
One of the main concerns with vote buying lies in the question of which population or group of voters are most likely to be susceptible to accepting compensation in exchange for their vote. Scholars such as Stokes argue that it is the weakly opposed voters are the best ones to target for vote buying.&lt;ref name=Stokes2005/&gt; This means that in a situation in which there are two parties running for office, for example, the voters who are not inclined to vote one way or the other are the best to target. 
Other scholars argue that it is people of lower income status who are the best group to target, as they are the most likely to be receptive to monetary or other forms of compensation.&lt;ref name=Stokes2005/&gt; This has proven to be the case in both Argentina and Nigeria. Since the wealthy are presumably not in need of money, goods or services, it would require a much larger compensation in order to sway their vote. However, as seen in the case of Argentina for example, citizens who reside within poor communities are in great need of income, or medical services, for example, to feed their families and keep them in good health. With that being said, a much smaller sum of cash or a medical prescription would be of much greater value and thus their political support can be much easier to purchase.

===== How to monitor =====
The main concern of a person when engaging in vote buying for the party involved is how to ensure that the votes the unethical candidate are buying are being cast in his/her favor. For example, in Argentina as in many other [[Representative democracy|representative democracies]], there is a secret ballot that is used to cast votes.&lt;ref name=Stokes2005/&gt; In some cases, there have been instances of voter tickets, or monitoring by individuals.&lt;ref name="Nichter2008"/&gt; Voters seeking to be compensated for their votes would use specially-provided voter ballots, or would fold their ballot in a particular way in order to indicate that they voted for the candidate they were paid to vote for. Monitoring could also include taking attendance at campaigns rallies, or keeping track of who took party transportation to voting booths.&lt;ref name="Larreguy et al 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0003055415000593 |title=Parties, Brokers, and Voter Mobilization: How Turnout Buying Depends Upon the Party's Capacity to Monitor Brokers |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=110 |pages=160 |year=2016 |last1=Larreguy |first1=Horacio |last2=Marshall |first2=John |last3=Querubín |first3=Pablo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars hold that this strategy of accountability works best in smaller communities as there is less anonymity, thus more incentive to vote as you are directed for fear of repercussion. Another strategy has been to invoke personalized social norms to make voters honor their contracts at the voting booth.&lt;ref name="rienner.com"/&gt; Such social norms could include personal obligation such as moral debts, social obligations to the buyers, or a threat of withholding or ceasing to produce necessary resources. This is made more effective when the rewards are delivered personally by the candidate or someone close to them, in order to create a sense of gratitude on behalf of the voters towards the candidate. A third strategy is informal sanctions. These are placed on voters who refuse material offers or who don’t vote as instructed. This type of sanction relies however on the ability to discern who voted as instructed and who did not.&lt;ref name="rienner.com"/&gt; This issue of monitoring is of ongoing concern for political parties, and new ways to do so are constantly being developed.

====  Consequences ====
There are several negative consequences that arise from the practice of vote buying. The presence of vote buying in democratic states poses a threat to democracy itself, as it interferes with the ability to rely on a popular vote as a measure of people's support for potential governments' policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3982/ECTA9035 |title=Vote-Buying and Reciprocity |journal=Econometrica |volume=80 |issue=2 |page=863 |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another noted consequence is that the autonomy of voters is undermined. Since getting paid or receiving rewards for their votes generates a form of income that they may need to support themselves or their families, they have no autonomy to cast the vote that they truly want.&lt;ref name=Stokes2005/&gt; This is extremely problematic because if it is the most corrupt politicians who are engaging in vote buying, then it is their interests that remain the ones that dictate how the country is going to be run. This, in turn, perpetuates corruption in the system even further creating an unbreakable cycle.

Thirdly, vote buying can create a dependency of voters on the income or goods that they are receiving for their votes, and can further perpetuate a type of poverty trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1365100510000246 |title=Vote-Buying and Growth |journal=Macroeconomic Dynamics |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=656 |year=2011 |last1=Gersbach |first1=Hans |last2=Mühe |first2=Felix }}&lt;/ref&gt; If they are receiving medicine from their communities’ broker for example, if this tie is cut off then they may no longer have access to this necessity. It can be true that the broker in that community has no interest or incentive to actually increase the standards of living of the community members, as it is very possible that they are only interested in getting whatever share of the profit they are entitled to for working for the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Javier |last1=Auyero |date=April 1999 |title='From the Client's Point(s) of View': How Poor People Perceive and Evaluate Political Clientelism |journal=Theory and Society |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=297–334 |jstor=3108473 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, if the goods or money are coming directly from a candidate, this candidate’s only wish is to maintain their power. That being said, they may provide services but their real interest may lie in keeping the voters dependent on the rewards they are providing in order to stay in power.

=== Turnout buying ===
{{Original research section|date=May 2018}}{{Undue weight|date=May 2018}}

Turnout buying occurs when a political party or candidate offers citizens compensation in order for them to turn out to the election, but does not monitor who they voted for specifically.&lt;ref name="Gans-Morse et al 2008"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gans-Morse |first1=Jordan |first2=Sebastián |last2=Mazzuca |first3=Simeon |last3=Nichter |year=2008 |title=Who Gets Bought? Vote Buying, Turnout Buying, and Other Strategies |url=https://wcfia.harvard.edu/publications/who-gets-bought-vote-buying-turnout-buying-and-other-strategies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Examples ====
===== United States =====
According to research done by Nichter, the United States has seen its fair share of turnout buying in recent elections. During the 2004 election, five Democratic Party operatives in East St. Louis were convicted in federal court for offering cigarettes, beer, medicine and $5 to $10 reward to increase turnout of the poor.&lt;ref name="Nichter2008"/&gt; One operative pleaded guilty and stated that if they didn’t provide rewards, "they" (the poor) wouldn’t come out. A local election in Oakland is another example. Campaign workers handed out thousands of coupons for free chicken dinners in an explicit and targeted effort to draw voters to the polls.&lt;ref name="Nichter2008"/&gt;

==== Argentina ====
In Susan Stokes’ article on corruption in elections in Argentina, she describes the case as being an example in which vote buying is taking place. This is further discussed in the section in vote buying above (link) Although this case was originally thought of as vote buying, another scholar by the name of Nitcher believes that it is, in fact, a case of turnout buying. Nichter simplifies Stokes’ original model that favors vote buying and finds that the populations who are actually being targeted in Argentina are in fact strong supporters of the party. This contradicts Stokes’ theory of weakly opposed voters being targeted and points to a situation of turnout buying instead.
&lt;ref name="Nichter2008"/&gt;

==== Advantages ====
One advantage of turnout buying is that it has the potential to increase political participation. The practice of vote buying is extremely corrupt which only hurts the state of a democracy. However, Nichter argues that turnout buying is arguably less corrupt than vote buying.&lt;ref name="Nichter2008"/&gt; Since it increases the likelihood of voter participation, we may see a more accurate representation of what the citizens want for their country’s politics. This could, in turn, enhance the quality of the country's democracy and the prevalence of the opinions and wishes of the voters. Since there is no direct monitoring of who an individual votes for, as long as they turn out to the voting booth then they will receive the compensation they were promised, but can still vote for whomever they desire.

==== Disadvantages ====
Although it is easier by far to monitor the turnout of an election over which votes were cast for which politicians, large problems still remain with turnout buying. Firstly, even though it has been said that turnout buying is less corrupt, this may not be the case. The practice of turnout buying, similarly to vote buying, can undermine voter autonomy. If a voter is given some type of compensation for turning out to an election to vote, this compensation and who it came from may play a part in who they vote for.&lt;ref name="Larreguy et al 2016"/&gt; Since the poorer demographics are largely the ones being targeted by turnout buying, they are also more likely to accept the rewards. For example, if Candidate A paid Voter B to turn out to the upcoming federal election, they may feel a subconscious loyalty to Candidate A, and this may sway their vote even if they are more aligned with the ideologies and policy of Candidate B. Even though the compensation is simply given for turning out to the voting booths, the politicians or broker giving the compensation may still have an agenda which is made clear to the voter. Meaning that turnout buying could still be inadvertent vote buying.&lt;ref name=Nichter2008/&gt;

Many scholars{{Like whom?|date=May 2018}} have noted that the capacity of the politicians to monitor their brokers is the means through which turnout buying becomes effective or not.&lt;ref name="Larreguy et al 2016"/&gt; If the mechanisms put in place to monitor the turn out that the party has paid for aren’t effective enough, then there will be no way of knowing if their resources are generating the results they want.

As with vote buying, turnout buying undermines the legitimacy of democracy. Only the wealthiest of political parties have the resources to buy turnout from voters. This leaves less wealthy but potentially more qualified parties at a loss when it comes to competing in elections.

===Disinformation===
People may distribute false or misleading information in order to affect the outcome of an election.&lt;ref name="Myagkov"/&gt; For example, in the [[Chilean presidential election, 1970|Chilean presidential election of 1970]], the U.S. government's [[Central Intelligence Agency]] used "black propaganda"—materials purporting to be from various political parties—to sow discord between members of a coalition between socialists and communists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foia.state.gov/Reports/ChurchReport.asp Church Report (Covert Action in Chile 1963–1973)], [[United States Senate]] [[Church Committee]], 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Another use of [[disinformation]] is to give voters incorrect information about the time or place of polling, thus causing them to miss their chance to vote. As part of the [[2011 Canadian federal election voter suppression scandal]], [[Elections Canada]] traced fraudulent phone calls, telling voters that their polling stations had been moved, to a telecommunications company that worked with the Conservative Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/02/22/racknine-inc-fraudulent-election-calls-traced/ |title=Fraudulent election calls traced to Racknine Inc., an Edmonton firm with Tory links &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; National Post |publisher=News.nationalpost.com |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misleading or confusing ballot papers===
Ballot papers may be used to discourage votes for a particular party or candidate, using the design or other features which confuse voters into voting for a different candidate. For example, in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. presidential election]], Florida's [[butterfly ballot]] paper was criticized as poorly designed, leading some voters to vote for the wrong candidate. While ballot was designed by a Democrat, it was the Democrat, [[Al Gore]], who was most harmed by voter errors because of this design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/13/recount.tm/index.html | work=CNN | first=Richard | last=Lacayo | title=Florida recount: In the eye of the storm | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622085605/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/13/recount.tm/index.html | archivedate=2011-06-22 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor or misleading design is usually not illegal and therefore not technically election fraud, but it can nevertheless subvert the principles of democracy.

[[Sweden]] has a system with separate ballots used for each party, to reduce confusion among candidates. However, ballots from small parties such as [[piratpartiet]], [[junilistan]] and [[feministiskt initiativ]] have been omitted or placed on a separate table in the election to the EU parliament in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20090615232203/http://www.sr.se/sormland/nyheter/artikel.asp?artikel=2894807&lt;/ref&gt; Ballots from [[Sweden Democrats]] have been mixed with ballots from the larger [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]], which used a very similar font for the party name written on the top of the ballot.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Another method of confusing people into voting for a different candidate than intended is to run candidates or create political parties with similar names or symbols as an existing candidate or party. The goal is to mislead voters into voting for the false candidate or party to influence the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathon|last=Hicks|authorlink=|title=Seeing Double on Ballot: Similar Names Sow Confusion|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E7D9173DF937A15754C0A9629C8B63&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Organizations/B/Board%20of%20Elections|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=July 24, 2004|accessdate=18 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304222653/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E7D9173DF937A15754C0A9629C8B63&amp;n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FOrganizations%2FB%2FBoard%20of%20Elections|archive-date=2009-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such tactics may be particularly effective when a large proportion of voters have limited literacy in the language used on the ballot. Again, such tactics are usually not illegal but often work against the principles of democracy.

Another type of possible electoral confusion is multiple variations of voting by different [[electoral system]]s. This may cause ballots to be counted as invalid if the wrong system is used. For instance, if a voter puts a [[first-past-the-post]] cross in a numbered [[single transferable vote]] ballot paper, it is invalidated. For example, in Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom, up to four different voting systems and types of ballots may be used, based on the jurisdictional level of elections for candidates. [[Local government in Scotland|Local elections]] are determined by [[single transferable vote]]s; [[Scottish Parliament general election|Scottish parliamentary elections]] by the [[additional member system]]; [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|national elections]] for the UK Parliament by [[first-past-the-post]]; and [[elections to the European Parliament]] by a [[Closed list|party list system]].

===Ballot stuffing===
{{see also|Notable instances of ballot box stuffing}}
[[File:Voting-box-6806.jpg|thumb|Transparent ballot box used in Russia to prevent election officials from pre-stuffing the box with fake ballots.]]
[[Image:Ballotstuffing.jpg|thumb|A specialised ballot box used to assist ballot stuffing, featured in [[Frank Leslie's Weekly|''Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper'']] in 1856.]]
'''Ballot stuffing''', or "ballot-box stuffing", is the illegal practice of one person submitting multiple [[ballot]]s during a [[vote]] in which only one ballot per person is permitted.

Ballot stuffing is still possible with electronic machines. For example, a version of the [[Sequoia Voting Systems|Sequoia]] touchscreen [[voting machine]] has a yellow button on the back side that allows repeated voting. Pressing the button triggers two audible beeps to alert election observers about the illegal votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.votetrustusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1958&amp;Itemid=162|title=VoteTrustUSA – Sequoia: Button On E-voting Machine Allows Multiple Votes|work=votetrustusa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misrecording of votes===
Many elections feature multiple opportunities for unscrupulous officials or 'helpers' to record an elector's vote differently from their intentions. Voters who require assistance to cast their votes are particularly vulnerable to having their votes stolen in this way. For example, a blind or illiterate person may be told that they have voted for one party when in fact they have been led to vote for another. This is similar to the misuse of proxy votes; however, in this case, the voter will be under the impression that they have voted with the assistance of the other person, rather than having the other person voting on their behalf.

Where votes are recorded through electronic or mechanical means, the voting machinery may be altered so that a vote intended for one candidate is recorded for another.

===Misuse of proxy votes===
[[Absentee voting#Proxy voting|Proxy voting]] is particularly vulnerable to election fraud, due to the amount of trust placed in the person who casts the vote. In several countries, there have been allegations of retirement home residents being asked to fill out 'absentee voter' forms. When the forms are signed and gathered, they are secretly rewritten as applications for proxy votes, naming party activists or their friends and relatives as the proxies. These people, unknown to the voter, cast the vote for the party of their choice. In the [[United Kingdom]], this is known as 'granny farming.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Row over Alzheimer woman's proxy |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/england/4510971.stm |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC MMVIII |accessdate=13 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419083742/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/england/4510971.stm |archivedate=19 April 2016 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Destruction or invalidation of ballots===
One of the simplest methods of electoral fraud is to destroy ballots for an opposing candidate or party. While mass destruction of ballots can be difficult to execute without drawing attention, in a very close election, it may be possible to destroy a very small number of ballot papers without detection, thereby changing the overall result. Blatant destruction of ballot papers can render an election invalid and force it to be re-run. If a party can improve its vote on the re-run election, it can benefit from such destruction as long as it is not linked to it.

Another method is to make it appear that the voter has spoiled his or her ballot, thus rendering it invalid. Typically this would be done by adding another mark to the paper, making it appear that the voter has voted for more candidates than entitled, for instance. It would be difficult to do this to a large number of paper ballots without detection in some locales, but altogether too simple in others, especially jurisdictions where legitimate ballot spoiling by voter would serve a clear and reasonable aim. Examples may include emulating protest votes in jurisdictions that have recently had and since abolished a "none of the above" or "against all" voting option, civil disobedience where voting is mandatory, and attempts at discrediting or invalidating an election. An unusually large share of invalidated ballots may be attributed to loyal supporters of candidates that lost in primaries or previous rounds, did not run or did not qualify to do so, or some manner of protest movement or organized boycott.

===Tampering with electronic voting machines===
All [[voting system]]s face threats of some form of electoral fraud. The types of threats that affect [[voting machine]]s vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://vote.nist.gov/threats/papers.htm|title= Threat Analyses &amp; Papers|date= October 7, 2005|publisher= [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]|accessdate= 5 March 2011|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061021021000/http://vote.nist.gov/threats/papers.htm|archivedate= 21 October 2006|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research at Argonne National Laboratories revealed that a single individual with physical access to a machine, such as a Diebold Accuvote TS, can install inexpensive, readily-available electronic components to manipulate its functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jaikumar Vijayan |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9220356/Argonne_researchers_hack_Diebold_e_voting_system_ |title=Argonne researchers 'hack' Diebold e-voting system |publisher=Computerworld |date=2011-09-28 |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Layton"&gt;{{cite web| last=Layton|first=J.|title=How can someone tamper with an electronic voting machine|url=http://people.howstuffworks.com/vote-tampering.htm|accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include:

* Tampering with the [[software]] of a voting machine to add malicious code that alters vote totals or favors a candidate in any way.
**Multiple groups have demonstrated this possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/ts-evt07-init.pdf |format=PDF |title=Security Analysis of the Diebold AccuVote-TS Voting Machine |publisher=Jhalderm.com |accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wijvertrouwenstemcomputersniet1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wijvertrouwenstemcomputersniet.nl/images/9/91/Es3b-en.pdfNedap/GroenendaalES3B|title=images |accessdate=February 17, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/editorial/15889697.htm]{{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Private companies manufacture these machines. Many companies will not allow public access or review of the machines [[source code]], claiming fear of exposing [[trade secret]]s.&lt;ref name="Bonsor"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonsor and Strickland|first=Kevin and Jonathan|title=How E-Voting Works|url=http://people.howstuffworks.com/e-voting2.htm|accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tampering with the hardware of the [[voting machine]] to alter vote totals or favor any candidate.&lt;ref name="wijvertrouwenstemcomputersniet1"/&gt;
**Some of these machines require a smart card to activate the machine and vote.

* Abusing the administrative access to the machine by election officials might also allow individuals to vote multiple times.
* Election results that are sent directly over the internet from a county count centre to the state count centre can be vulnerable to a [[man-in-the-middle attack]], where they are diverted to an intermediate website where the man in the middle flips the votes in favour of a certain candidate and then immediately forwards them on to the state count centre. All votes sent over the internet violate the chain of custody and hence should be avoided by driving or flying memory cards in locked metal containers from county count centres to the state count centre. For purposes of getting quick preliminary statewide results on election night, encrypted votes can be sent over the internet, but final official results should be tabulated the next day only after the actual memory cards arrive in secure metal containers and are counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://electiondefensealliance.org/man_in_the_middle |title="Man in the Middle" Attacks to Subvert the Vote |publisher=Electiondefensealliance.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721233505/http://electiondefensealliance.org/man_in_the_middle |archive-date=2015-07-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voter impersonation===
{{Main|Voter impersonation|Voter ID laws}}

==== United States ====
Some commentators, such as former [[Federal Election Commission]] member [[Hans von Spakovsky]], have claimed that voter impersonation fraud, in which one person votes by impersonating another, eligible voter, is widespread, but documentation has been scarce and prosecutions rare. Numerous others, such as Professor [[Larry Sabato]], and a variety of studies have shown this to be "relatively rare" in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/10/29/the-voter-fraud-myth | title=The Voter-Fraud Myth | work=The New Yorker | date=29 October 2012 | accessdate=9 December 2015 | author=Mayer, Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013, when the US Supreme Court ruled that a provision of the Voting Rights Act was no longer enforceable, several states have passed [[voter ID laws]], ostensibly to counter the alleged fraud. But many experts counter that voter ID laws are not very effective against some forms of impersonation. These ID laws have been challenged by minority groups that claimed to be disadvantaged by the changes. By August 2016, four federal court rulings overturned laws or parts of such laws because they placed undue burdens on minority populations, including African Americans and Native Americans.&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{cite news |author=Rober Barnes |title=Federal judge blocks N. Dakota’s voter-ID law, calling it unfair to Native Americans |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/federal-judge-blocks-n-dakotas-voter-id-law-calling-it-unfair-to-native-americans/2016/08/01/47a903e0-582c-11e6-9767-f6c947fd0cb8_story.html |work=Washington Post |date=August 1, 2016 |accessdate=2016-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In each case: Texas, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and North Dakota, and may adversely affect minority voters. The states are required to accept alternatives for the November 2016 elections. These cases are expected to reach the US Supreme Court for hearings.

Allegations of widespread [[United States presidential election, 2016|voter fraud in the 2016 United States presidential election]] by busing out-of-state voters to New Hampshire were found to be false.&lt;ref name="nh_once"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/06/01/says-once-and-for-all-that-one-was-bused-vote/bQxQPQxyrvEOUzXTirnwDP/story.html |title=N.H. says once and for all that no one was bused in to vote |date=1 June 2018 |publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]'' |author=James Pindell}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Suspcions of hacking of electronic voting machines in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania were determined to be unfounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/801221907609579520 |title=Nate Silver on Twitter |newspaper=Twitter|access-date=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The N.C. Board of Elections reported in 2017 on questions of voter fraud and the state's proposed voter ID law. The report showed that out of 4,769,640 votes cast in the Nov 2016 election in North Carolina, only one illegal vote would potentially have been blocked by the voter ID law. The investigation found fewer than 500 incidences of invalid ballots cast, the vast majority of which were cast by individuals on probation for [[felony]] who were likely not aware that this status disqualified them from voting, and the total amount of invalid votes was far too small to have affected the outcome of any race in North Carolina in the 2016 election.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.charlotteobserver.com/opinion/editorials/article146486019.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=North Carolina State Board of Elections|date=April 21, 2017|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.ncsbe.gov/sboe/Post-Election%20Audit%20Report_2016%20General%20Election/Post-Election_Audit_Report.pdf|access-date=June 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425061254/https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.ncsbe.gov/sboe/Post-Election%20Audit%20Report_2016%20General%20Election/Post-Election_Audit_Report.pdf|archive-date=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artificial results===
{{Main|Show election}}
In particularly corrupt regimes, the voting process may be nothing more than a sham, as officials would simply announce whatever results they want, sometimes without even bothering to count the votes. Such practices tend to draw international condemnation, but voters typically have little recourse, as there would seldom be any ways to remove the "winner" from power, short of a revolution.

==Vote fraud in legislature==
Vote fraud can also take place in legislatures. Some of the forms used in national elections can also be used in parliaments, particularly intimidation and vote-buying. Because of the much smaller number of voters, however, election fraud in legislatures is qualitatively different in many ways. Fewer people are needed to 'swing' the election, and therefore specific people can be targeted in ways impractical on a larger scale. For example, [[Adolf Hitler]] achieved his [[dictator]]ial powers due to the [[Enabling Act of 1933]]. He attempted to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority to pass the Act by arresting members of the opposition, though this turned out to be unnecessary to attain the needed majority. Later, the Reichstag was packed with [[Nazi]] party members who voted for the Act's renewal.

In many legislatures, voting is public, in contrast to the [[secret ballot]] used in most modern public elections. This may make their elections more vulnerable to some forms of fraud since a politician can be pressured by others who will know how he or she has voted. However, it may also protect against bribery and blackmail, since the public and media will be aware if a politician votes in an unexpected way. Since voters and parties are entitled to pressure politicians to vote a particular way, the line between legitimate and fraudulent pressure is not always clear.

As in public elections, proxy votes are particularly prone to fraud. In some systems, parties may vote on behalf of any member who is not present in parliament. This protects those members from missing out on voting if prevented from attending parliament, but it also allows their party to prevent them from voting against its wishes. In some legislatures, proxy voting is not allowed, but politicians may rig voting buttons or otherwise illegally cast "ghost votes" while absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.lp.findlaw.com/hamilton/20040408.html |title=Is "Ghost" Voting Acceptable? |publisher=Writ.lp.findlaw.com |date=2004-04-08 |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
The two main strategies for the prevention of electoral fraud in society are: 1) Deterrence through consistent and effective prosecution; and 2) Cultivation of mores that discourage corruption. The two main fraud prevention tactics can be summarised as secrecy and openness. The [[secret ballot]] prevents many kinds of intimidation and vote selling, while transparency at all other levels of the electoral process prevents and allows detection of most interference.

===Mores===
The patterns of conventional behaviour in a society, or [[mores]], are an effective means for preventing electoral fraud and corruption in general. A good example is [[Sweden]], where the culture has a strong tendency toward positive values, resulting in a low incidence of political corruption.&lt;ref name=cpi&gt;{{cite web|title=Corruption Perceptions Index|url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi|work=Transparency International|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=1 December 2011|author=|year=2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619145956/http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi|archive-date=19 June 2006|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until recently [[Canada]] had a similar reputation. The [[In and Out scandal]] of 2008 and the [[Robocall scandal]] of 2011 has tarnished Canada's electoral integrity.

An advantage of cultivating positive mores as a prevention strategy is that it is effective across all electoral systems and devices. A disadvantage is that it makes other prevention and detection efforts more difficult to implement because members of society generally have more trust and less of a [[Confidence trick#Vulnerability to confidence tricks|sense for fraudulent methods]].

===Secret ballot===
{{Main|Secret ballot}}
The [[secret ballot]], in which only the voter knows how they have voted, is believed by many to be a crucial part of ensuring free and fair elections through preventing voter intimidation or retribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why You Should Expect Challenges To Secret Ballots|url=http://thefederalist.com/2016/07/12/why-you-should-expect-challenges-to-secret-ballots/|publisher=The Federalist|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the secret ballot enables election fraud (because it makes it harder to verify that votes have been counted correctly) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepress.org/article/scrap-secret-ballot-return-open-voting|title=Scrap the "secret" ballot – return to open voting}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/~davies/secret-ballot.pdf|title=Consequences of the Secret Ballot|author=Todd Davies|publisher=Symbolic Systems Program, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it discourages voter participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abolish the Secret Ballot|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/abolish-the-secret-ballot/309038/|publisher=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the secret ballot was sometimes practiced in [[ancient Greece]] and was a part of the [[Constitution of the Year III]] of 1795, it only became common in the nineteenth century. Secret balloting appears to have been first implemented in the former British [[colony]]—now an [[Australia]]n [[States and territories of Australia|state]]—of [[Tasmania]] on 7 February 1856. By the turn of the century, the practice had spread to most Western democracies.

In the United States, the popularity of the Australian ballot grew as reformers in the late 19th century sought to reduce the problems of election fraud. Groups such as the Greenbackers, Nationalist, and more fought for those who yearned to vote, but were exiled for their safety. George Walthew, Greenback, helped initiate one of the first secret ballots in America in Michigan in 1885. Even George Walthew had a predecessor in John Seitz, Greenback, who campaigned a bill to " preserve the purity of elections" in 1879 after the discovery of Ohio's electoral fraud in congressional elections.

The efforts of many helped accomplish this and led to the spread of other secret ballots all across the country. As mentioned on February 18, 1890, in the Galveston News “The Australian ballot has come to stay. It protects the independence of the voter and largely puts a stop to vote to buy.” Before this, it was common for candidates to intimidate or bribe voters, as they would always know who had voted which way.

===Transparency===
Most methods of preventing electoral fraud involve making the election process completely transparent to all voters, from nomination of candidates through casting of the votes and tabulation.&lt;ref name="CB1"&gt;{{cite web| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |title=Dangerous Ideas |url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=1892 |work=Voting Fiasco, Part 279.236(a) |publisher=Criminal Brief |accessdate=2010-10-07 |date=2008-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A key feature in ensuring the integrity of any part of the electoral process is a strict [[chain of custody]].

To prevent fraud in central tabulation, there has to be a public list of the results from every single polling place. This is the only way for voters to prove that the results they witnessed in their election office are correctly incorporated into the totals.

[[End-to-end auditable voting systems]] provide voters with a receipt to allow them to verify their vote was cast correctly, and an audit mechanism to verify that the results were tabulated correctly and all votes were cast by valid voters. However, the ballot receipt does not permit voters to prove to others how they voted, since this would open the door towards forced voting and blackmail. End-to-end systems include [[Punchscan]] and [[Scantegrity]], the latter being an add-on to optical scan systems instead of a replacement.

In many cases, [[election observers]] are used to help prevent fraud and assure voters that the election is fair. International observers (bilateral and multilateral) may be invited to observe the elections (examples include election observation by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), European Union election observation missions, observation missions of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), as well as international observation organised by NGOs, such as [[CIS-EMO]], European Network of Election Monitoring Organizations (ENEMO), etc.). Some countries also invite foreign observers (i.e. bi-lateral observation, as opposed to multi-lateral observation by international observers).

In addition, national legislatures of countries often permit domestic observation. Domestic election observers can be either partisan (i.e. representing interests of one or a group of election contestants) or non-partisan (usually done by civil society groups). Legislations of different countries permit various forms and extents of international and domestic election observation.

Election observation is also prescribed by various international legal instruments. For example, paragraph 8 of the 1990 Copenhagen Document states that "The [OSCE] participating States consider that the presence of observers, both foreign and domestic, can enhance the electoral process for States in which elections are taking place. They, therefore, invite observers from any other CSCE participating States and any appropriate private institutions and organisations who may wish to do so to observe the course of their national election proceedings, to the extent permitted by law. They will also endeavour to facilitate similar access for election proceedings held below the national level. Such observers will undertake not to interfere in the electoral proceedings".

Critics note that observers cannot spot certain types of election fraud like targeted [[voter suppression]] or manipulated software of [[voting machine]]s.

===Statistical indicators===
Various forms of [[statistic]]s can be indicators of election fraud, e.g. [[exit poll]]s which diverge from the final results. Well-conducted exit polls serve as a deterrent to electoral fraud. However, exit polls are still notoriously imprecise. For instance, in the Czech Republic, some voters are afraid or ashamed to admit that they voted for the Communist Party (exit polls in 2002 gave the Communist party 2–3 percentage points less than the actual result).

When elections are marred by ballot-box stuffing (e.g., the Armenian presidential elections of 1996 and 1998), the affected polling stations will show abnormally high voter turnouts with results favouring a single candidate. By graphing the number of votes against turnout percentage (i.e., aggregating polling stations results within a given turnout range), the divergence from bell-curve distribution gives an indication of the extent of the fraud. Stuffing votes in favour of a single candidate affects votes vs. turnout distributions for that candidate and other candidates differently; this difference could be used to quantitatively assess the number of votes stuffed. Also, these distributions sometimes exhibit spikes at round-number turnout percentage values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://podmoskovnik.livejournal.com/65386.html |title=podmoskovnik: Cтатья о выборах из Троицкого Варианта |publisher=Podmoskovnik.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=27 октября 2009&amp;nbsp;года. |url=http://www.trvscience.ru/2009/10/27/statisticheskoe-issledovanie-rezultatov-rossijskix-vyborov-2007-2009-gg |title=Статистическое исследование результатов российских выборов 2007–2009 гг. : Троицкий вариант – Наука |publisher=Trvscience.ru |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2015-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423162343/http://trvscience.ru/2009/10/27/statisticheskoe-issledovanie-rezultatov-rossijskix-vyborov-2007-2009-gg/ |archive-date=2013-04-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Walter R.

[[Risk-limiting audit]]s are methods to assess the validity of an election result statistically without the effort of a full [[election recount]].

===Prosecution===
In the United States one such case was in [[Pennsylvania]] where [[Bill Stinson]] won an election based on fraudulent absentee ballots. The courts ruled that his opponent be seated in the state Senate as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Decourcy |first=Michael |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E5DE153BF93AA25751C0A962958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink |title=Vote-Fraud Ruling Shifts Pennsylvania Senate |location=Pennsylvania |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1994-02-19 |accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Philippines]], former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] was arrested in 2011 following the filing of criminal charges against her for electoral sabotage, in connection with the [[Philippine general election, 2007]]. She was accused of conspiring with election officials to ensure the victory of her party's [[Senate of the Philippines|senatorial]] slate in the province of [[Maguindanao]], through the tampering of election returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/96265/comelec-files-poll-sabotage-raps-vs-Arroyo |title=Electoral sabotage case filed vs Arroyo, Ampatuan, Bedol |author=Jeannette I. Andrade |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=2011-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting machine integrity===
{{further|Certification of voting machines}}

One method for verifying [[voting machine]] accuracy is [[Parallel Testing]], the process of using an independent set of results compared to the original machine results. Parallel testing can be done prior to or during an election. During an election, one form of parallel testing is the [[VVPAT]]. Voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) or verified paper record (VPR) is a method of providing feedback to voters using a ballotless voting system. A VVPAT is intended as an independent verification system for voting machines designed to allow voters to verify that their vote was cast correctly, to detect possible election fraud or malfunction, and to provide a means to audit the stored electronic results. This method is only effective if [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] numbers of voters verify that their intended vote matches both the electronic and paper votes.

On election day, a statistically significant number of voting machines can be randomly selected from polling locations and used for testing. This can be used to detect potential fraud or malfunction unless manipulated software would only start to cheat after a certain event like a voter pressing a special key combination (Or a machine might cheat only if someone doesn't perform the combination, which requires more insider access but fewer voters).

Another form of testing is [[Logic &amp; Accuracy Testing]] (L&amp;A), pre-election testing of voting machines using test votes to determine if they are functioning correctly.

Another method to ensure the integrity of electronic voting machines is independent [[software verification]] and [[Certification of voting machines|certification]].&lt;ref name=" CB1" /&gt; Once a software is certified, code signing can ensure the software certified is identical to that which is used on election day. Some argue certification would be more effective if voting machine software was publicly available or [[open source]].

Certification and testing processes conducted publicly and with oversight from interested parties can promote transparency in the election process. The integrity of those conducting testing can be questioned.

Testing and certification can prevent voting machines from being a [[Black Box Voting|black box]] where voters cannot be sure that counting inside is done as intended.&lt;ref name="  CB1" /&gt;

One method that people have argued would help prevent these machines from being tampered with would be for the companies that produce the machines to share the source code, which displays and captures the ballots, with computer scientists. This would allow external sources to make sure that the machines are working correctly.&lt;ref name="Bonsor"/&gt;

===Voting Rights Act of 1965===
{{main|Voting Rights Act of 1965}}
This was the most important federal legislation of the 20th century to protect voting rights, especially of ethnic and language minorities who had been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] for decades by states' constitutions and practices. Initially, it was particularly important for enforcing the constitutional right of African Americans in the South to vote, where millions of people had been mostly disenfranchised since the turn of the 20th century and excluded from politics. The law has also protected other ethnicities, such as Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans, and language minorities in other states, who have been discriminated against at various times, especially in the process of voter registration and electoral practices.

===Civil Rights Act of 1964===
{{Main|Civil Rights Act of 1964}}

== Activism ==
Reynaga became a sex worker at 19.  After being a victim of institutional violence and experiencing imprisonment multiple times in Argentinar, she travelled to work in Spain for a time. She   returned to Argentina and founded AMMAR in 1994  in response to police harassment and violence. 

According to the organization, between 1996 and 2001, 41 member of AMMAR were murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ammar.org.ar/-Quienes-somos-.html|title=ammar.org.ar|website=www.ammar.org.ar|access-date=2018-06-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016135956/http://www.ammar.org.ar/-Quienes-somos-.html|archivedate=2017-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMMAR operates as a trade union and since 1995 it has been an affiliated member of the [[Argentine Workers' Central Union]] (''Central de Trabajadores de la Argentina''). AMMAR has also been part of RedTraSex since 1997;  Reynaga has been its Executive Secretary since 1999. The organization works for the defence, promotion, recognition and respect for human rights of sex workers in fifteen countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.redtrasex.org/-Sobre-Nosotras-|title=RedTraSex|website=www.redtrasex.org|access-date=2018-06-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205234300/http://www.redtrasex.org/-Sobre-Nosotras-|archivedate=2017-12-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reynaga co-edited  ''Un Movimiento de Tacones Altos'' (The High Heels Movement) a manual for the defense of sex workers' rights published in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.redtrasex.org/IMG/pdf/armado-manual.pdf|title=El Movimiento de Tacones Altos|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180608115936/https://www.redtrasex.org/IMG/pdf/armado-manual.pdf|archivedate=2018-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Welcome to America, indeed 4891695155.jpg|thumb|Sticker sold in [[Colorado]] demanding immigrants speak English]]
The '''English-only movement''', also known as the '''Official English movement''', is a [[political movement]] for the use of only the [[English language]] in official [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] operations through the establishment of English as the only [[official language]] in the US. The US has never had a legal policy proclaiming an official national language. However, at some times and places, there have been various moves to promote or require the use of English, such as in [[American Indian boarding schools]]. Some language selection policies have been implemented at the state level. These efforts are being driven by [[U.S. English (organization)|U.S. English]], the nation's oldest and largest organization advocating for Official English.

==Early efforts==
Disputes between citizens and immigrants over English have been waged since the 1750s, when street signs were changed in Pennsylvania to include both English and German languages to accommodate the many German immigrants.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rich|first1=Alex|last2=Vance|first2=Noelle|chapter=English As A National Language: An Overview |title=Points of View: English As National Language|date=March 1, 2016|page= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rich and Vance, the German-English debate continued until World War I when international hostility resulted in the rejection of all things German, including the prohibition of the German language and German-language materials, particularly books.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1803, as a result of the [[Louisiana Purchase]], the United States acquired [[French language|French]]-speaking populations in [[Louisiana]]. As a condition to [[admittance to the Union]], Louisiana included in its constitution a provision, which was later repealed, that required all official documents be published in the language "in which the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]] is written". Today, Louisiana has no law stating that English is the official language of the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.languagepolicy.net/archives/can-la.htm|title=Language Policy -- Louisiana|last=Crawford|first=James|date=|website=Language Legislation in the U.S.A.|publisher=|access-date=October 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–1848), the United States acquired about 75,000 [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speakers in addition to several [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous language]]-speaking populations.

An 1847 law authorized Anglo-French instruction in public schools in Louisiana. In 1849, the [[California constitution]] recognized Spanish language rights. French language rights were abolished after the [[American Civil War]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} In 1868, the [[Indian Peace Commission]] recommended English-only schooling for the [[Native American in the United States|Native Americans]]. In 1878–79, the California constitution was rewritten to state that "[a]ll laws of the State of [[California]], and all official writings, and the executive, legislative, and judicial proceedings shall be conducted, preserved, and published in no other than the English language."{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In the late 1880s, [[Wisconsin]] and [[Illinois]] passed English-only instruction laws for both public and parochial schools.

In 1896, under the [[Republic of Hawaii]] government, English became the primary medium of public schooling for [[Hawaii]]an children. After the [[Spanish–American War]], English was declared "the official language of the school room" in [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Crawford|title=At War With Diversity: U.S. Language Policy in an Age of Anxiety|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vuH5zFBsQxEC|year=2000|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=978-1-85359-505-9|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vuH5zFBsQxEC&amp;pg=PA17 17]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, English was declared the official language in the [[Philippines]], after the [[Philippine–American War]].

During [[World War I]], there was a widespread campaign against the use of the [[German language]] in the US; this included removing books in the German language from libraries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Martin|first=James J|authorlink=James J. Martin|title=An American Adventure in Bookburning in the Style of 1918|publisher=Ralph Myles Publisher|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A related action took place in [[South Australia]] as well with the Nomenclature Act of 1917. The legislation renamed 69 towns, suburbs, or areas that had German names.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Leadbeater |first=Maureen M |title=German Place Names in South Australia: |url=http://www.adelaideco-op.familyhistorysa.info/germanplacenames.htm |accessdate=December 29, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, a bill drafted by Congressman [[Washington J. McCormick]] became the first proposed legislation regarding the United States' national language that would have made "American" the national language in order to differentiate the United States's language from that of England.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This bill did not pass in Congress despite significant support—especially from Irish immigrants who were resentful of British influence.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Arguments for English-only==
In 1907, [[US President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] wrote, "We have room for but one language in this country, and that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American [[nationality]], and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house."&lt;ref&gt;Roosevelt, Theodore, ''Works'' (Memorial ed., 1926), vol. XXIV, p. 554 (New York: Charles Scribner's 11 Sons).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U.S. English (organization)|U.S. English]], the nation's oldest and largest organization advocating for Official English,  summarizes their belief by saying that "the passage of English as the official language will help to expand opportunities for immigrants to learn and speak English, the single greatest empowering tool that immigrants must have to succeed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.us-english.org/inc/about/ "Background of organization"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601222708/http://www.us-english.org/inc/about/ |date=June 1, 2006 }} at us-english.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ProEnglish]], the nation's leading advocates of Official English, summarizes their belief that "in a pluralistic nation such as ours, the function of government should be to foster and support the similarities that unite us, rather than institutionalize the differences that divide us." Therefore, ProEnglish "works through the courts and in the court of public opinion to defend English's historic role as America's common, unifying language, and to persuade lawmakers to adopt English as the official language at all levels of government."&lt;ref&gt;[http://proenglish.org/about-us/mission "Mission of organization"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718172400/http://www.proenglish.org/about-us/mission |date=July 18, 2011 }} at proenglish.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, [[Dade County, Florida]] voters approved an "anti-bilingual ordinance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.law.miami.edu/studentorg/interamerican_law_review/pdf/ialr_symposium_01302007.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Language Battle: Speaking the Truth |publisher=University of Miami Law School |work=Inter-American Law Review |date=February 9, 2007 |page=2 |accessdate=February 17, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ygfJZ29i?url=http://www.law.miami.edu/studentorg/interamerican_law_review/pdf/ialr_symposium_01302007.pdf |archivedate=May 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was repealed by the county commission in 1993, after "racially orientated redistricting"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Observer-Reporter|date=May 3, 1993|page=A8|title='English only' law may be repealed in Florida county|quote=The racially orientated redistricting of the Dade County commission may accomplish what a long campaign by Hispanics has failed to do – repeal the local "English only" law.}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to a change in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=May 23, 1993|page=1D|title=The power of language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, English was declared the official language in the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|commonwealth]] of [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.languagepolicy.net/archives/va.htm Official English Laws: Code of Virginia, Chapter 829], languagepolicy.net, accessed February 22, 2015/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, [[John Tanton]] and [[U.S. Senator]] [[S. I. Hayakawa]] founded a political lobbying organization, [[U.S. English (organization)|U.S. English]]. (Tanton was a former head of the [[Sierra Club]]'s population committee and of [[Population Connection|Zero Population Growth]], and founder of the [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]] (FAIR), an [[immigration reduction]]ist group.) In 1986, Tanton wrote a memo containing remarks about [[Hispanics]] claimed by critics to be derogatory, which appeared in the ''[[Arizona Republic]]'' newspaper, leading to the resignations from U.S. English board member [[Walter Cronkite]] and executive director [[Linda Chavez]]; Tanton would also sever his ties to the organization as a result. That same year, 1986, [[Larry Pratt]] founded English First, while [[Lou Zaeske]], an engineer from [[Bryan, Texas|Bryan]], [[Texas]], established the American Ethnic Coalition. [[Mauro E. Mujica|Mauro Mujica]], a Chilean immigrant, was later named Chairman and CEO in 1993.

In 1985, [[Kae T. Patrick]], a member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]] from [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] was the lone supporter of his unsuccessful attempt to authorize English as the official language of Texas. His House Concurrent Resolution No. 13 died in the State Affairs Committee. Patrick said his resolution was more important than having a "state bird". In subsequent sessions of the legislature, the move toward Official English gained supporters, including [[Talmadge Heflin]] of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], but never enough members to approve enactment of a law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hI7kG1x237kC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=Kae+T+Patrick&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cLtrlly_L-&amp;sig=XL6IyQMTXsqjNGO0clpb7M0fsaI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HWbmVIGABYefgwTfuoCYBQ&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Kae%20T%20Patrick&amp;f=false|title=Nativism Reborn?: The Official English Language Movement and the American States|author=Raymond Tatalovich|publisher=[[University of Kentucky Press]]|location=[[Lexington, Kentucky]]|page=166|accessdate=February 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, John Tanton and other former U.S. English associates founded ProEnglish specifically to defend [[Arizona]]'s English-only law. ProEnglish rejects the term "English-only movement" and asks its supporters to refer to the movement instead as "Official English".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In what was essentially a replay of the 2006 actions, on June 6, 2007 the US Senate again voted on two separate amendments to a subsequent immigration reform bill that closely resembled the amendments to the 2006 Senate bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Criticism==
The modern English-only movement has met with rejection from the [[Linguistic Society of America]], which passed a resolution in 1986–87 opposing "'English only' measures on the grounds that they are based on misconceptions about the role of a common language in establishing political unity, and that they are inconsistent with basic American traditions of linguistic tolerance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Linguist [[Geoffrey Pullum]], in an essay entitled "Here come the linguistic fascists", charges [[English First (lobbying organization)|English First]] with "hatred and suspicion of aliens and immigrants" and points out that English is far from under threat in the United States, saying "making English the official language of the United States of America is about as urgently called for as making [[hot dog|hotdogs]] the official food at [[baseball]] games."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Pullum | first = Geoffrey K. | authorlink = Geoffrey Pullum | title = Here come the linguistic fascists. | journal = [[Natural Language and Linguistic Theory]] | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | year = 1987 | pages = 603–9 | doi = 10.1007/BF00138990 | postscript = .}} Reprinted in {{Citation | title = The Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax and Other Irreverent Essays on the Study of Language | year = 1991 | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | isbn = 0-226-68534-9 | pages = 111–19 | author = Geoffrey K. Pullum.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rachele Lawton, applying [[critical discourse analysis]], argues that English-only's rhetoric suggests that the "real motivation is discrimination and disenfranchisement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lawton | first = Rachele | title = Speak English or Go Home: The Anti-Immigrant Discourse of the American 'English Only' Movement | journal = Critical Approaches to Discourse Analysis Across Disciplines | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | year = 2013 | pages = 100–122 | url = http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/journals/cadaad/volume-7-1/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) has stated that English-only laws are inconsistent with both the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to communicate with or petition the government, as well as [[Freedom of expression|free speech]] and the right to equality, because they bar government employees from providing non-English language assistance and services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/immigrants/gen/11713pub20000908.html The Rights of Immigrants -ACLU Position Paper (9/8/2000). Retrieved on 2008-12-11]&lt;/ref&gt; On August 11, 2000, President [[Bill Clinton]] signed [[Executive Order 13166]], "Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency." The Executive Order requires Federal agencies to examine the services they provide, identify any need for services to those with [[limited English proficiency]] (LEP), and develop and implement a system to provide those services so LEP persons can have meaningful access to them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/cor/Pubs/eolep.php Executive Order 13166.

While the judicial system has noted that state English-only laws are largely symbolic and non-prohibitive, supervisors and managers often interpret them to mean English is the mandatory language of daily life.&lt;ref name="kari gibson"&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/sls/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Gibson.pdf Gibson, Kari. English only court cases involving the U.S workplace. University of Hawai'i. Retrieved on 2008-12-11]&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, an elementary school bus driver prohibited students from speaking Spanish on their way to school after [[Colorado]] passed its legislation.&lt;ref name="kari gibson"/&gt; In 2004 in [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], a teacher claimed to be enforcing English immersion policies when she allegedly slapped students for speaking Spanish in class.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Ryman and Ofelia Madrid, ''Hispanics upset by teacher's discipline'', The Arizona Republic, January 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], a student was suspended for speaking Spanish in the school hallways. The written discipline referral explaining the decision of the school to suspend the student for one and a half days, noted: "This is not the first time we have [asked] Zach and others to not speak Spanish at school."&lt;ref&gt;T.R.

One study of English-only statutes during the Americanization period (1910–1930) finds that the policies moderately increased the literacy of certain foreign-born children but had no impact on immigrants' eventual labor market outcomes or measures of social integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Did the Americanization Movement Succeed?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5331">The '''Equivalent National Tertiary Entrance Rank''' ('''ENTER''') was the national [[Australia]]n tertiary entrance rank, administered by [[Universities Australia]] (previously called the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee). It was a percentile ranking, designed to simplify the comparison of entrance levels for students educated in different processes of admission for university applicants from interstate. It was replaced by the [[Australian Tertiary Admission Rank]] from 2010.

==Equivalence==
The term ENTER was only used in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (1999-2009), although the actual rank was identical and equivalent to the [[Universities Admission Index]] (UAI) used in [[New South Wales]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]], and to the [[Tertiary Entrance Rank]] (TER) used in [[South Australia]], the [[Northern Territory]], [[Tasmania]] and [[Western Australia]]. [[Queensland]] used a different system called the [[Overall Position]] (OP), but conversion tables were published each year to convert the OP to or from an ENTER.

Non-school-leaver university applicants were selected using other criteria: usually previous results, or results in the [[Special Tertiary Admissions Test]].

Each state's university and government education authorities determined the method of calculation of the ENTER or state-equivalent for students from that state, due to the historical differences between different state's education systems. However, these decisions were co-ordinated to ensure that the necessary equivalence is maintained (i.e. so that an ENTER of 90.00 from Victoria would indicate a sufficiently similar degree of attainment as a UAI of 90.00 from New South Wales, in spite of the differences in each rank's methods of application.)

==Calculation==
The [[Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority]] (VCAA) was the authority responsible for conducting assessments in Victoria. It determined Study Scores for each [[Victorian Certificate of Education]] (VCE) Unit 3/4 subject successfully completed by a student, ranging from 0 to 50. It also determined whether a student had "satisfactorily" completed the VCE.

For all students who satisfactorily completed the VCE, and who meet certain other criteria for receiving an ENTER, VCAA provided the students' Subject Study Scores to the [[Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre]] (VTAC). VTAC then scaled the Subject Study Scores to allow for cross-study calculations - that is, the Study Scores were adjusted up or down to take into account the strength of competition amongst the cohort of students studying the subject that year. Scaling was undertaken to ensure that each subject contributes equally to the ENTER. In other words, a 25 in English was equivalent to a 25 in Mathematical Methods or a 25 in any other VCE subject. The scaled Study Scores are referred to as ''ENTER subject scores''.

VTAC determines an ENTER for each student who satisfactorily completed at least one subject in the current year, and who had obtained VCE Study Scores in an English study and at least three other studies in an allowable combination at the Unit 3 &amp; 4 level.

A student's overall ENTER was calculated as the total of:

* The ENTER subject score in an English subject (one of English, English Language, Literature or English as a Second Language)(any one of these subjects was compulsory for the VCE))
* The ENTER subject scores of the next three best subjects (the English study and these constituted the ''Primary Four'')
* Plus an increment of 10% of the next best two subjects (if available).
* additional studies such as [[Vocational Education and Training]] (VET) or tertiary [[extension studies]] may also have been considered.

Candidates were ranked in order of these aggregates. The ENTER was the percentile ranking of each student's position on this list in steps of 0.05 ranging from 0.00 to 99.95. For instance, an ENTER of 80.00 indicated that the aggregate was higher than 80% of aggregates. Each 0.05 rank typically contained around 20 students, depending on the number of students in the cohort each year.

Ranks less than 30.00 were typically only disclosed as "less than 30", as the exact ranking at this low level was not deemed educationally useful and may have been demoralising to the recipient.

The '''Estonian Land Reform Act 1919''' ([[Estonian language|Estonian]]: 1919. Eesti maareform) was passed in [[Estonia]] on the 10 October 1919 shortly after the [[Estonian Declaration of Independence|independence]] of the nation earlier that year. The act expropriated land from the [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] landowners which had previously made up much of the landowning elite. As part of the act the government distributed the nationalised land to mainly Estonian small farmers. 

==Distribution of Land==
The reforms expropriated 1065 manors (96.6% of large landowners were affected) of which only 57 manors came from Estonian owners with the rest owned mainly by Baltic Germans along with land from the [[Russia|Russian state]] and [[Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church|church land]]. The amount of land in total nationalised came to over 2.34 million hectares of land which accounted for 58% of the total agricultural land in Estonia. Manorial industrial enterprises were also nationalised by the state and sold (this included 225 vodka factories, 344 mills, 74 sawmills, 64 stone and clay industries, 18 dairies and 7 breweries). Overall about 53,000 Estonian settlers received expropriated land with 1.2mn hectares going to the 23,000 individuals affected by the land reform (though just 3.6% of land was given back to the former owner).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.estemb.de/static/files/092/malestuskillud.pdf |title=The collection of articles on the 15th anniversary of the conclusion of diplomatic relations between Estonia and Germany .

==Compensation==

'''Export-oriented industrialization''' ('''EOI''') sometimes called '''export substitution industrialization''' ('''ESI'''), '''export led industrialization''' ('''ELI''') or export-led growth is a [[trade]] and [[Economics|economic]] [[policy]] aiming to speed up the [[industrialization]] process of a country by [[export]]ing goods for which the nation has a [[comparative advantage]]. Export-led growth implies opening domestic markets to foreign competition in exchange for market access in other countries.

However, this may not be true of all domestic markets, as governments may aim to protect specific nascent industries so they grow and are able to exploit their future comparative advantage and in practice the converse can occur. For example, many [[East Asia]]n countries had strong barriers on [[import]]s from the 1960s to the 1980s.

Reduced [[tariff]] barriers, a [[floating exchange rate]] (a [[devaluation]] of national [[currency]] is often employed to facilitate exports), and government support for exporting sectors are all an example of policies adopted to promote EOI and, ultimately, economic development. Export-oriented industrialization was particularly characteristic of the development of the national economies of the [[Four Asian Tigers|Asian Tigers]]: [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Singapore]] in the post-[[World War II]] period.

'''Export-led growth''' is an economic strategy used by some [[developing countries]].  This strategy seeks to find a niche in the world economy for a certain type of export.  Industries producing this export may receive governmental [[subsidies]] and better access to the local markets.  By implementing this strategy, countries hope to gain enough hard currency to import [[commodities]] manufactured more cheaply elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;Goldstein, Joshua S., and Jon C. Pevehouse. ''International Relations''. 8th ed. New York: Pearson Longman, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a recent mathematical study shows that export-led growth is where wage growth is repressed and linked to the productivity growth of non-tradable goods in a country with under-valued currency. In such a country, the productivity growth of export goods is greater than the proportional wage growth and the productivity growth of non-tradable goods. Thus, export price decreases in the export-led growth country and makes it more competitive in international trade.&lt;ref&gt;Ünal, E. (2016) "A Comparative Analysis of Export Growth in Turkey and China through Macroeconomic and Institutional Factors" Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review. Vol. 13 (1), pp. 57–91. DOI :10.1007/s40844-016-0036-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A comparative analysis of export growth in Turkey and China through macroeconomic and institutional factors|first=Emre|last=Ünal|date=1 June 2016|journal=Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review|volume=13|issue=1|pages=57–91|doi=10.1007/s40844-016-0036-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
From the [[Great Depression]] to the years after World War II, under-developed and developing countries started to have a hard time economically.  During this time, many foreign markets were closed and the danger of trading and shipping in war-time waters drove many of these countries to look for another solution to development.  The initial solution to this dilemma was called [[import substitution industrialization]].  Both Latin American and Asian countries used this strategy at first.  However, during the 1950s and 1960s the Asian countries, like Taiwan and South Korea, started focusing their development outward, resulting in an export-led growth strategy.  Many of the Latin American countries continued with import substitution industrialization, just expanding its scope.  Some have pointed out that because of the success of the Asian countries, especially Taiwan and South Korea, export-led growth should be considered the best strategy to promote development.&lt;ref name="Gibson"&gt;Gibson, Martha Liebler, and Michael D. Ward. "Export Orientation: Pathway or Artifact?" ''International Studies Quarterly'' 36.3 (1992): 331-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
Export-led growth is important for mainly two reasons: The first is that export-led growth improves the country's foreign-currency finances, as well as surpass their [[debts]] as long as the facilities and materials for the exports exist.  The second, if more debatable reason, is that increased export-growth can trigger greater [[productivity]], thus creating even more exports in a positive, upward spiral cycle.&lt;ref name="McCombie"&gt;McCombie, J.S.L., and A.P. Thirlwall. ''Economic Growth and the Balance-of-Payments Constraint.'' New York: St. Martin's, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nomenclature of this concept appears in  J.S.L McCombie et al (1994):&lt;ref name="McCombie"/&gt;

y&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the relationship between expenditures and income in foreign-currency trade; it marks the [[balance of payments]] constraint

y&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the growth capacity of the country, which can never be more than the current capacity

y&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is the current capacity of growth, or how well the country is producing at that moment

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(i)  y&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;=y&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;=y&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;:  balance-of-payments equilibrium and [[full employment]]

(ii) y&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;=y&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;y&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;:  balance-of-payments equilibrium and growing [[unemployment]]

(iii)y&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;y&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;=y&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;:  increasing balance-of-payments deficit and full employment

(iv) y&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;y&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;y&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;:  increasing balance-of-payments deficit and growing unemployment

(v)  y&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;=y&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;:  increasing balance-of-payments surplus and full employment

(vi) y&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;y&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;:  increasing balance-of-payments surplus and growing unemployment (McCombie 423)&lt;ref name="McCombie"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Countries with both unemployment and balance-of-payments problems are supposed, according to the dominant economic paradigm, to orient their policies towards export-led growth aiming to achieve either situation (i) or situation (v).

== Types of exports ==
There are essentially two types of exports used in this context: [[manufactured goods]] and [[raw materials]].

Manufactured goods are the exports most commonly used to achieve export-led growth.  However, many times these industries are competing against industrialized countries' industries, which often have better technology, better educated workers, and more [[Capital (economics)|capital]] to start with.  Therefore, this strategy must be well thought out and planned.  A country must find a certain export that they can manufacture well, in competition with industrialized industries.&lt;ref name="Goldstein"/&gt;

Raw materials are another export option.  However, this strategy is risky compared to manufactured goods.  If the [[terms of trade]] shift unfavorably, a country must export more and more of the raw materials to import the same amount of commodities, making the trade profits very difficult to come by.&lt;ref name="Goldstein"/&gt;

== Criticism and counter arguments ==
===Theoretical===
[[Neoclassical economics|Mainstream economic analysis]] points out that EOI presupposes that a government contains the relevant market-knowledge enabling it to judge whether or not an industry to be given development subsidies will prove a good investment in the future. The ability of a government to do this, it is argued, is probably limited as it will not have occurred through the natural interaction of the [[market forces]] of [[supply and demand]].  Additionally, they claim that the exploitation of a potential [[comparative advantage]] requires a significant amount of [[investment]], of which governments can only supply a limited amount. In many [[Least Developed Countries|LDCs]], it is necessary for [[multinational corporation]]s to provide the [[foreign direct investment]], knowledge, skills and training needed to develop an industry and exploit the future [[comparative advantage]].

This line of argument runs against [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] (and particularly [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian]]) analysis. There, the investment requirements for state investment, denominated in the national currency, are never operationally constrained; any claim about the "limited" ability of the state to finance expenditures in its own currency is rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Randall Wray|Wray, L. Randalla]]
 (2014). "[[Modern Monetary Theory]] [http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2014/06/modern-money-theory-basics.html basics]"&lt;/ref&gt; Neither, Post-Keynesians state, is there a question of the private sector competing with the state for available funds, due to their opinions on hypotheses about "[[Crowding out (economics)|crowding out]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Warren Mosler|Mosler, Warren]] (2014). "[http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2014/06/modern-money-theory-basics.html The Myth of Crowding Out]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Mitchell (economist)|Mitchell, William]] (2011). "[http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=13423 Destructive economic myths]"&lt;/ref&gt; As to the claim about the state's inability to engage in basic, primary, "paradigm changing" investment in [[research and development]], the work of economists such as [[Mariana Mazzucato]] has claimed that the claim is groundless.&lt;ref name=mazz&gt;[[Mariana Mazzucato|Mazzucato, Mariana]] (2013). ''[https://www.demos.co.uk/files/Entrepreneurial_State_-_web.pdf The Entrepreneurial State: Debunking Public vs. Private Sector Myths]]'', Anthem Press: London, UK, {{ISBN|9780857282521}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scholars have claimed that governments in East Asia, nonetheless, did have the ability and the resources to identify and exploit [[comparative advantage]]s. EOI has, therefore, been supported as a development strategy for poor countries - because of its success in the [[Four Asian Tigers]]. 

This claim has been challenged by a minority of non-mainstream economists, who have instead emphasised the very specific historical, political, and legislative conditions in [[East Asia]] that were not present elsewhere, and which allowed for the success of EOI in these nations. Japanese producers, for example, were given preferential access to US and European markets after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Borden | first = William |  title = The Pacific Alliance: United States Foreign Economic Policy and Japanese Trade Recovery, 1947-1955 | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1984 | location = Madison | pages = 187 | url = | doi = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some domestic production was explicitly protected from outside competition, for an extensive period of time and until local business entities had become strong enough to compete internationally.&lt;ref name=chang&gt;[[Ha-Joon Chang|Chang, Ha-Joon]] (2007). ''[[Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism]]'', United States: Bloomsbury Press, {{ISBN|978-1596915985}}&lt;/ref&gt; They claim that the protectionist policies are crucial to the success of EOI. &lt;ref name=chang/&gt;

===Empirical===
Despite its support in mainstream economic circles, EOI's ostensible success has been increasingly challenged over recent years due to a growing number of examples in which it has not yielded the expected results.  EOI increases market sensitivity to exogenous factors, and is partially responsible for the damage done by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] to the economies of countries who used export-oriented industrialization.  This is something which occurred during the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] and subsequent global recession. Similarly, localized disasters can cause worldwide shortages of the products that countries specialize in.  For example, in 2010, [[2010 Thailand floods|flooding in Thailand]] led to a shortage of [[hard drive]]s.

Other criticisms include that export oriented industrialization has limited success if the economy is experiencing a decline in its [[terms of trade]], where prices for its exports are rising at a slower rate than that of its imports.  This is true of many economies aiming to exploit their comparative advantage in primary commodities as they have a long term trend of declining prices, noted in the [[Singer-Prebisch thesis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/oupcambje/v_3a10_3ay_3a1986_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a355-71.htm|title=EconPapers: The Singer-Prebisch Hypothesis: A Statistical Evaluation|journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics|volume=10|issue=4|pages=355–71|author=Prabirjit Sarkar|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there are criticisms of this thesis as practical contradictions have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045302026.html|title=Prebisch-Singer Hypothesis - Dictionary definition of Prebisch-Singer Hypothesis - Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary-commodity dependency also links to the weakness of excessive [[Departmentalization|specialization]] as primary commodities have incredible price volatility, given the inelastic nature of their demand, leading to a disproportionately large change in price given a change in demand for them.

[[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel]] laureate [[Paul Krugman]] has criticized what he called the "popular views" on macroeconomic policy as they were shaped in the 1950s, and, particularly, regarding [[productivity]] and [[International trade|foreign-trade]] economic policy.&lt;ref name=krug&gt;[[Paul Krugman|Krugman, Paul]] (1994). ''[[Peddling Prosperity: Economic Sense and Nonsense in an Age of Diminished Expectations]]'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company: United States, {{ISBN|978-0393312928}}, p.280&lt;/ref&gt; The "highly influential" position that "the United States needs higher productivity so that it can compete in today’s global economy", he wrote, is akin to the person supporting it  “wearing a flashing [[Neon#Applications|neon]] sign that reads:  'I don't know that I'm talking about'."&lt;ref name=krug/&gt;

===Logical===
One of the main arguments against the assumption of export-oriented policies as potential solutions in a country's problems rests on the tenet that an economic orientation should be applicable to every country, in general and allowing for local conditions. If following an export-oriented path is beneficial for country A, then it should also be so for country B, ''[[ceteris paribus]]''. However, that is an impossible task since, as a matter of trivial logic, it is impossible for all the countries on the planet to become [[net export]]ers.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.economist.com/node/21538100 Exports to Mars]", ''[[The Economist]]'', 12 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.''''', 551 U.S. 449 (2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.|volume=551|page=449|pin=|year=2007}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that issue ads may not be banned from the months preceding a primary or general election.

== Background ==
In 2002, the [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] ("McCain-Feingold" or "BCRA"), amending the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]] to further regulate money in public election campaigns. One primary purpose of the legislation was to regulate what were colloquially known as "issue ads." "Issue ads" typically discussed a candidate name with regards to a particular issue, but because they did not expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate, they fell outside the prohibitions and limitations of the Federal Election Campaign Act. Section 203 of BCRA prohibited corporations and unions from directly or indirectly funding "electioneering communications," defined as broadcast ads costing in excess of an aggregated $10,000 that mentioned a candidate for federal political office within 30 days of a [[primary election]] or 60 days of a [[general election]]. In ''[[McConnell v. Federal Election Commission]],'' the Supreme Court upheld section 203 and other sections of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act against a [[facial challenge]] that the law was unconstitutional.

Wisconsin Right to Life Inc. ("WRTL"), a nonprofit advocacy group, sought to run ads asking voters to contact their Senators and urge them to oppose [[filibusters]] of judicial nominees. (The text of one of WRTL's proposed ads is listed at the conclusion of this article). WRTL sought to run its ads within the 30- and 60-day blackout provisions of BCRA. However, because WRTL was itself incorporated and also because it accepted corporate contributions, it was prohibited from doing so. WRTL argued that the proposed ads addressed a current issue pending in Congress and did not advocate the election or defeat of a candidate. As such, the government had no compelling interest in prohibiting them from airing even during the election session.

In the first round of litigation, the federal district court ruled that the language of ''McConnell v. FEC'' precluded not only a facial challenge, but also an "as applied" challenge to this portion of BCRA and so dismissed the case. However, in ''Wisconsin Right to Life v. Federal Election Commission''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Wisconsin Right to Life v. FEC|volume=546|page=410|pin=|year=2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ("WRTL I"), the Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case to the lower courts to determine whether or not WRTL should be granted an "as applied" exception to the law.

On remand, the FEC argued that ads run so close to an election and naming a candidate or candidates should be presumed to have the intent of influencing the election, and thus BCRA's limitation on financing such ads with corporate funds was constitutionally valid. It argued that WRTL's specific ads were intended to and would influence the 2004 Senate election in Wisconsin. The district court rejected the FEC's argument and refused to delve into the matter of the intent and underlying meaning of the ads. The Court stated that such an investigation would be impractical and would "have a chilling effect on protected speech." The District court thus limited its review to that content of the ad. In doing so, the court found that they were not "sham" issue ads and did not expressly advocate for or against a candidate. It, therefore, found that the government lacked a compelling interest to abridge WRTL's rights of free speech. The FEC appealed and the case returned to the Supreme Court.

== Opinion of the Supreme Court ==
The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, crafted a major exception to the limitations on broadcast ads within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election. The court ruled that unless an ad could not reasonably be interpreted as anything other than an ad urging the support or defeat of a candidate (in other words, unless an ad expressly urges support or defeat of a candidate), it was eligible for an "as applied" exception to the McCain-Feingold limits on issue ads close to an election.

The decision of the Court, authored by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John G. Roberts]], is notable not only for its holding, affirming the lower court, but for its strong language (repeatedly referring to BCRA's prohibition as the "blackout" period; rebuking calls for greater regulation of political speech by declaring "Enough is enough"; and concluding "we give the benefit of the doubt to speech, not censorship") and for demonstrating a skepticism of campaign finance regulation that was absent in ''McConnell''. In the opinion, Roberts argued that Congress's ability to limit speech about politicians and issues was limited to "express advocacy or its functional equivalent." Roberts endorsed the lower court's view that it would be improper and would chill speech to subject speakers to an extensive investigation of motive and factor surrounding the ad and, instead, limited review to the content of the ad itself. Although, in theory, the opinion left BCRA's prohibition on "electioneering communications" standing and conformed with ''McConnell v. FEC'', for most practical purposes, it cut deeply into the law, reverting it to its pre-''McConnell'' state in which only speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate could be constitutionally subject to limits and prohibitions on financing. Though announcing the Court's judgment, Roberts' opinion was joined only by Justice [[Samuel Alito]]. The rest of the majority consisted of Justices [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Anthony Kennedy]], and [[Clarence Thomas]], who would have gone further and simply reversed ''McConnell'' outright.

Justices [[John Paul Stevens]], [[Stephen Breyer]], [[David Souter]], and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] dissented.

Although "WRTL II," as the case is generally called, remains an important marker in First Amendment campaign finance jurisprudence, as a practical matter, it has been largely superseded by the Court's 2010 decision in ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]''.

==Proposed text of WRTL ad==
:''[Wedding scene]''
:PASTOR: And who gives this woman to be married to this man?
:BRIDE'S FATHER: Well, as father of the bride, I certainly could. But instead, I'd like to share a few tips on how to properly install drywall. Now you put the drywall up ...
:VOICE-OVER: Sometimes it's just not fair to delay an important decision. But in Washington, it's happening. A group of Senators are using the filibuster delay tactic to block federal judicial nominees from a simple "yes" or "no" vote. So qualified candidates don't get a chance to serve. It's politics at work, causing gridlock and backing up some of our courts to a state of emergency. Contact Senators Feingold and Kohl and tell them to oppose the filibuster.

'''Flushing International High School''' is a [[New York City]] public [[high school]] that opened in September 2004 in [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], New York.  Students come from over 30 different countries and speak over twenty different native languages.  Flushing International is a NYC School Empowerment School in District 25.

== History ==
Flushing International High School is a member of [[The Internationals Network for Public Schools]], a non-profit organization that grew out of the work of a group of international high schools in New York City. The organization now supports 12 schools in New York and California. The first international high school, located on the campus of [[LaGuardia Community College]], opened in 1985; two more followed in the 1990s. Since 2001, the network has opened and supported 9 additional high schools with the help of the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]. The network of schools annually serves 4,000 students immigrating from 90 countries.  The network’s mission is to provide quality education to recently arrived immigrants by developing and networking small high schools based on the Internationals approach.

'''François Quesnay''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃swa kɛnɛ|lang}}; 4 June 1694 – 16 December 1774) was a [[France|French]] [[economist]] and [[physician]] of the [[Physiocrats|Physiocratic]] school.&lt;ref&gt;Cutler J. Cleveland, [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Biophysical_economics "Biophysical economics"], ''Encyclopedia of Earth'', Last updated: 14 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for publishing the "[[Tableau économique]]" (Economic Table) in 1758, which provided the foundations of the ideas of the Physiocrats.&lt;ref&gt;See the biographical note in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 31'' (International Publishers: New York, 1989) p. 605.&lt;/ref&gt; This was perhaps the first work attempting to describe the workings of the economy in an analytical way, and as such can be viewed as one of the first important contributions to economic thought. His ''Le Despotisme de la Chine'', written in 1767, describes Chinese politics and society, and his own political support for constitutional [[Oriental despotism]].&lt;ref name="OEMF"/&gt;

==Life==
Quesnay was born at [[Méré, Yvelines|Méré]] near [[Versailles (commune)|Versailles]], the son of an advocate and small landed proprietor. [[Apprenticeship|Apprenticed]] at the age of sixteen to a surgeon, he soon went to Paris, studied medicine and surgery there, and, having qualified as a master-surgeon, settled down to practice at [[Mantes]]. In 1737 he was appointed perpetual secretary of the academy of surgery founded by [[François Gigot de la Peyronie]], and became surgeon in ordinary to [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]]. In 1744 he graduated as a doctor of medicine; he became physician in ordinary to the king, and afterwards his first consulting physician, and was installed in the [[Palace of Versailles]]. His apartments were on the ''entresol'', whence the Réunions de l'entresol{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} received their name. Louis XV esteemed Quesnay highly, and used to call him his thinker. When he ennobled him he gave him for arms three flowers of the [[pansy#Name origin and significance|pansy]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; (derived from ''pensée'', in French meaning ''thought''), with the [[Latin]] [[motto]] ''Propter cogitationem mentis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taieb.net/auteurs/Quesnay/albon.html |title=Nouvelles Ephemerides, Économiques, Seconde Partie, Analyses, Et Critiques Raisonnées. N° Premier. Éloge Historique De M. Quesnay, Contenant L'Analyse De Ses Ouvrages, Par M. Le Cte D'A*** |publisher=Taieb.net |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He now devoted himself principally to [[economics|economic studies]], taking no part in the court intrigues which were perpetually going on around him. Around 1750 he became acquainted with [[Jacques Claude Marie Vincent de Gournay|Jacques C. M. V. de Gournay]] (1712–1759), who was also an earnest inquirer in the economic field; and round these two distinguished men was gradually formed the philosophic sect of the Économistes, or, as for distinction's sake they were afterwards called, the Physiocrates. The most remarkable men in this group of disciples were the elder [[Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] (author of ''L'Ami des hommes'', 1756–60, and ''Philosophie rurale'', 1763), [[Nicolas Baudeau]] (''Introduction a la philosophie économique'', 1771), [[Guillaume-François Le Trosne|G. F. Le Trosne]] (''De l'ordre social'', 1777), [[André Morellet]] (best known by his controversy with [[Ferdinando Galiani|Galiani]] on the freedom of the grain trade during the [[Flour War]]), [[Mercier Larivière]], and [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours|du Pont de Nemours]]. [[Adam Smith]], during his stay on the continent with the young [[Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch|Duke of Buccleuch]] in 1764–1766, spent some time in Paris, where he made the acquaintance of Quesnay and some of his followers; he paid a high tribute to their scientific services in his ''Wealth of Nations''.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, Adam, 1937, The Wealth of Nations, N. Y.: Random House, p. 643; first published 1776.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Quesnay married in 1718, and had a son and a daughter; his grandson by the former was a member of the first Legislative Assembly. He died on 16 December 1774, having lived long enough to see his great pupil, [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune]], in office as minister of finance.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Works==
[[File:Quesnay Tableau.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tableau économique]]]]
His economic writings are collected in the 2nd vol. of the ''Principaux économistes'', published by Guillaumin, Paris, with preface and notes by Eugène Daire; also his ''Oeuvres économiques et philosophiques'' were collected with an introduction and note by August Oncken (Frankfort, 1888); a facsimile reprint of the ''Tableau économique'', from the original MS., was published by the British Economic Association (London, 1895). His other writings were the article "Évidence" in the ''Encyclopédie'', and ''Recherches sur l'évidence des vérites geometriques'', with a ''Projet de nouveaux éléments de géometrie'', 1773. Quesnay's Eloge was pronounced in the [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] by Grandjean de Fouchy (see the Recueil of that Academy, 1774, p.&amp;nbsp;134). See also [[Jean-François Marmontel|F.J. Marmontel]], ''Mémoires''; ''Mémoires de Mme. du Hausset''; H. Higgs, ''The Physiocrats'' (London, 1897).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Economics===
[[File:Quesnay - Tableau economique, 1965 - 5891137.tif|thumb|''Tableau economique'', 1965]]
In 1758 he published the ''[[Tableau économique]]'' (Economic Table), which provided the foundations of the ideas of the Physiocrats. This was perhaps the first work to attempt to describe the workings of the economy in an analytical way, and as such can be viewed as one of the first important contributions to economic thought.&lt;ref name="O'Hara1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Phillip Anthony O'Hara|title=Encyclopedia of Political Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vkO8Z_078GoC&amp;pg=PA848|accessdate=21 July 2012|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-18718-3|page=848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publications in which Quesnay expounded his system were the following: two articles, on "Fermiers" (Farmers) and on "Grains", in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1756, 1757);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rde_0769-0886_1990_num_8_1_1057 Kafker, Frank A.: ''Notices sur les auteurs des 17 volumes de « discours » de l'Encyclopédie (suite et fin).'' Recherches sur Diderot et sur l'Encyclopédie Année (1990) Volume 8 Numéro 8 p. 112]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; a discourse on the law of nature in the ''Physiocratie'' of Dupont de Nemours (1768); ''Maximes générales de gouvernement economique d'un royaume agricole'' (1758), and the simultaneously published ''Tableau économique avec son explication, ou extrait des économies royales de [[Maximilien de Bethune, duc de Sully|Sully]]'' (with the celebrated motto, ''Pauvres paysans, pauvre royaume; pauvre royaume, pauvre roi''); ''Dialogue sur le commerce et les travaux des artisans''; and other minor pieces.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The ''Tableau économique'', though on account of its dryness and abstract form it met with little general favor, may be considered the principal manifesto of the school. It was regarded by the followers of Quesnay as entitled to a place amongst the foremost products of human wisdom, and is named by the elder Mirabeau, in a passage quoted by [[Adam Smith]],&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; as one of the three great inventions which have contributed most to the stability of political societies, the other two being those of writing and of money. Its object was to exhibit by means of certain formulas the way in which the products of agriculture, which is the only source of wealth, would in a state of perfect liberty be distributed among the several classes of the community (namely, the productive classes of the proprietors and cultivators of land, and the unproductive class composed of manufacturers and merchants), and to represent by other formulas the modes of distribution which take place under systems of Governmental restraint and regulation, with the evil results arising to the whole society from different degrees of such violations of the natural order. It follows from Quesnay's theoretic views that the one thing deserving the solicitude of the practical economist and the statesman is the increase of the net product; and he infers also what Smith afterwards affirmed, on not quite the same ground, that the interest of the landowner is strictly and indissolubly connected with the general interest of the society. A small edition de luxe of this work, with other pieces, was printed in 1758 in the Palace of Versailles under the king's immediate supervision, some of the sheets, it is said, having been pulled by the royal hand. Already in 1767 the book had disappeared from circulation, and no copy of it is now procurable; but, the substance of it has been preserved in the ''Ami des hommes'' of Mirabeau, and the ''Physiocratie'' of Dupont de Nemours.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Quesnay, François|volume=22|pages=742–743|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orientalism and China===
Quesnay is known for his writings on Chinese politics and society. His book ''Le Despotisme de la Chine'', written in 1767, describes his views of the Chinese imperial system.&lt;ref name="OEMF"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ina Baghdiantz McCabe|title=Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade, Exoticism and the Ancien Regime|date=15 July 2008|publisher=[[Berg Publishers]]|isbn=978-1-84520-374-0|pages=271–72}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 August 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He was supportive of the meritocratic concept of giving scholars political power, without the cumbersome aristocracy that characterized French politics, and the importance of agriculture to the welfare of a nation. The phrase ''[[laissez-faire]]'', coined by fellow Physiocrat [[Vincent de Gournay]], is postulated to have come from Quesnay's writings on China.&lt;ref name="OEMF"/&gt; Gregory Blue writes that Quesnay "praised China as a constitutional despotism and openly advocated the adoption of Chinese institutions, including a standardized system of taxation and universal education." Blue speculates that this may have influenced the 1793 establishment of the Permanent Settlement in [[Bengal]] by the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;{{cite book|author=E. S. Shaffer|title=Comparative Criticism: Volume 22, East and West: Comparative Perspectives|date=30 November 2000|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-79072-7|pages=239–40}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 August 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Quesnay's interests in Orientalism has also been a source of criticism. Carol Blum, in her book ''Strength in Numbers'' on 18th century France, labels Quesnay an "apologist for [[Oriental despotism]]."&lt;ref name="Blum"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carol Blum|title=Strength in Numbers: Population, Reproduction, and Power in Eighteenth-Century France|date=5 February 2002|publisher=[[JHU Press]]|isbn=978-0-8018-6810-8|page=16}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 August 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his admiration of [[Confucianism]], Quesnay's followers bestowed him with the title "Confucius of Europe."&lt;ref name="Rothbard"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Murray N.

The '''French Union''' ({{Lang-fr|Union française}}) (1946–1958) was a political entity created by the [[France|French]] [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] to replace the old French colonial system, colloquially known as the "[[French colonial empire|French Empire]]" ({{lang|fr|Empire Français}}). It was the formal end of the "indigenous" ({{lang|fr|[[indigénat|indigène]]}}) status of French subjects in colonial areas.

==Composition==

The French Union had five components:
# [[Metropolitan France]], which included [[French Algeria]].
# 'Old' colonies, notably those of the [[French West Indies]] in the [[Caribbean]] that became [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas departments]] in 1946.
# 'New' colonies, renamed [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas territories]].
# [[Protectorate]]s of [[French Indochina]]. It had been expected that other protectorates would become part of the French Union, but the rulers of [[French Morocco]] and [[French Tunisia]] refused to become members and never belonged.&lt;ref&gt;Charles-Robert Argeron, ''La décolonisation française'', Armand Colin, Paris, 1994, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[United Nations Trust Territories]], such as [[French Cameroons]] and [[French Togoland]], successors of the [[League of Nations]] mandates.

==History==
The French Union was established by the [[French constitution]] of October 27, 1946 (Fourth Republic). Under it, it was said that there were no French colonies, but that metropolitan France, the overseas departments, and the overseas territories combined to create a single French Union, or just one France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wITHtDxnUI8C&amp;pg=PA285 |title=Human Rights and the End of Empire: Britain and the Genesis of the European Convention |first=Alfred William Brian |last=Simpson |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |ISBN=0199267898 |page=285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of this union was "assimilation of the overseas territories into a greater France, inhabited by French citizens, and blessed by French culture".&lt;ref name=Simpson286&gt;Simpson, Human Rights (2004), p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the British colonial system had local colonial governments which would eventually evolve into separate national governments; France wanted to create a single government under a single French state.&lt;ref name=Simpson286/&gt;

This French Union had a President, a High Council and an Assembly. The President was the President of the Republic. The Assembly of the Union had membership from the [[Council of the Republic (France)|Council of the Republic]], from the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] and from regional assemblies of the overseas territories and departments but ultimately had no power.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Human Rights (2004), p. 285–286&lt;/ref&gt; The High Council ultimately met only three times, first in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Human Rights (2004), p. 286 fn. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly was the only actually functioning institution that could manage legislation within the overseas territories.&lt;ref name=Simpson286/&gt;

In reality, the colonial areas had representation but all power remained in the French Parliament and thus was centralized.&lt;ref name=Simpson286/&gt; The colonies had local assemblies but these had only limited local power.&lt;ref name=Simpson286/&gt; Instead, various natives of the overseas territories in metropolitan France grew into a group of elites, known as {{lang|fr|evolués}}.&lt;ref name=Simpson286/&gt;

On January 31, 1956, hoping to having peace in Algiers, the system changed, abandoning assimilation in favor of autonomy, allowing territories to develop their own local government and to eventually gain their independence.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Human Rights (2004), p. 286-287&lt;/ref&gt; This would not succeed however and in 1958 the French Union was replaced by the [[French Community]] by {{lang|fr|[[Charles de Gaulle]]|italic=no}}'s [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] wherein France was now a federation of states with their own self-government.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Human Rights (2004), p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

This article covers the '''history of the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]]''' of [[Canada]].

==20th century==

===Origins and early history===
[[Image:TommyDouglas-c1971-crop.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Tommy Douglas]], Leader: 1961-1971]]

In 1956, after the birth of the [[Canadian Labour Congress]] (CLC) by a merger of two previous labour congresses, negotiations began between the CLC and the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) to bring about an alliance between organized labour and the political left in Canada. In 1958 a joint CCF-CLC committee, the National Committee for the New Party (NCNP), was formed to create a "new" social democratic political party, with ten members from each group. The NCNP spent the next three years laying down the foundations of the [[New Party (Canada)|New Party]]. During this process, a large number of New Party Clubs were established to allow like-minded Canadians to join in its founding, and six representatives from New Party Clubs were added to the National Committee. In 1961, at the end of a five-day-long Founding Convention which established its principles, policies and structures, the New Democratic Party was born and [[Tommy Douglas]], the long-time CCF [[Premier of Saskatchewan]], was elected its first leader.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mta.ca/faculty/arts/canadian_studies/english/about/study_guide/roots/ccf2ndp.html The evolution of CCF into NDP: 1961 and after&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1960, before the NDP was founded, one candidate, [[Walter Pitman]], won a [[by-election]] under the [[New Party (Canada)|New Party]] banner.

The influence of [[organized labour]] on the party is still reflected in the party's conventions as affiliated unions send delegates on a formula based on their number of members. Since approximately one-quarter of the convention delegates have recently been from affiliated labour groups, after the party changed to an Every Member Vote method of electing leaders in leadership races, labour delegate votes are scaled to 25% of the total number of ballots cast for leader.

===Trudeau minority===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Davidlewis.jpg|right|thumb|142px|[[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], &lt;br /&gt; Leader: 1971-1975|{{ifdc|1=Davidlewis.jpg|log=2009 October 7}}]] --&gt;
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Ndp70s.PNG|thumb|Early NDP logo]] --&gt;

Under the leadership of [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]] (1971–1975), the NDP supported the minority government formed by [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s Liberals from 1972 to 1974, although the two parties never entered into a [[coalition government|coalition]]. Together they succeeded in passing several socially progressive initiatives into law such as pension indexing and the creation of the crown corporation [[Petro-Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://canadaonline.about.com/od/federalndp/p/davidlewis.htm David Lewis - Federal NDP Leader 1971-75 - Biography of David Lewis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the NDP worked with the Progressive Conservatives to pass a motion of non-confidence, forcing an [[Canadian federal election, 1974|election]]. However, it backfired as Trudeau's Liberals regained a majority government, mostly at the expense of the NDP, which lost half its seats. Lewis lost his own riding and resigned as leader.

===Height of popularity===
&lt;!--[[Image:Edbroadbent.jpg|right|thumb|142px|[[Ed Broadbent]], &lt;br /&gt; Leader: 1975-1989]]--&gt;
Under the leadership of [[Ed Broadbent]] (1975–1989), the NDP played a critical role during [[Joe Clark]]'s minority government of 1979-1980, moving the [[Motion of No Confidence|non-confidence motion]] on [[John Crosbie]]'s budget that brought down the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] (PC) government, and forced the election that brought Trudeau's Liberal Party back to power.

In the [[Canadian federal election, 1984|1984 election]], which saw the Conservatives win the most seats in Canadian history, the NDP won 30 seats, only one behind the 31 it won in [[Canadian federal election, 1972|1972]].  The governing Liberals were decimated, falling to 40 seats in what was at the time the worst defeat of a sitting government at the federal level.  The NDP fared far better than expected, considering the Tories won the biggest majority government in Canadian history.  Third parties historically do not do well in landslide election contests.  More importantly, they were only 10 seats behind the Liberals—the closest the party and its predecessors had ever gotten to the two major parties up to that point. It was also the best performance for a third party in almost 60 years.  This led to some talk that Canada was headed for a UK-style Tory-Labour division, with the NDP pushing the Liberals into oblivion.  Afterwards, Broadbent himself consistently out-polled Liberal leader [[John Turner]] and even Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]].

On July 20, 1987, the NDP swept three by-elections in Newfoundland, Ontario, and the Yukon, picking up two formerly Conservative seats and holding one NDP seat.  These by-elections brought [[Audrey McLaughlin]] to the House of Commons as the MP for Yukon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/HFER/hfer.asp?Language=E&amp;Search=Bres&amp;ridProvince=0&amp;genElection=0&amp;byElection=1987%2F07%2F20&amp;submit1=Search History of Federal Ridings since 1867&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NDP elected a record 43 [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) in the [[Canadian federal election, 1988|election of 1988]]. The Liberals, however, had reaped most of the benefits of opposing free trade to emerge as the dominant alternative to the ruling government. The Conservatives' barrage of attacks on the Liberals, as well as vote-splitting between the NDP and Liberals, helped them win a second consecutive majority.  In 1989, Broadbent stepped down after 14 years as federal leader of the NDP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/broadbent/ CBC News Indepth: Ed Broadbent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline===
At the [[New Democratic Party leadership elections|party's leadership convention]], former [[List of British Columbia premiers|B.C. Premier]] [[Dave Barrett]] and Audrey McLaughlin were the main contenders for the leadership. During the campaign, Barrett argued that the party should be concerned with [[Western Alienation|western alienation]], rather than focusing its attention on [[Quebec]]. The Quebec wing of the NDP strongly opposed Barrett's candidacy, with [[Phil Edmonston]], the party's main spokesman in Quebec, threatening to resign from the party if Barrett won.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0000533 Barrett, David&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Barrett's campaign was also hurt when his back-room negotiations with leadership rival [[Simon De Jong]] were inadvertently recorded by the latter's CBC microphone. In these discussions, De Jong apparently agreed to support Barrett in exchange for being named House Leader, but he changed his mind at the last minute and supported McLaughlin instead, announcing his endorsement of her before the vote.  In the course of his discussion with Barrett, De Jong explained "It's a head and heart thing," i.e., that his head told him to go with Dave while his heart told him to go with Audrey. McLaughlin won the leadership on the fourth ballot, becoming the first woman in Canada to lead a political party.

Although enjoying strong support among organized labour and rural voters in the Prairies, McLaughlin tried to expand their support into Quebec without much success. In 1989, the [[Nouveau Parti démocratique du Québec|Quebec New Democratic Party]] adopted a [[Quebec sovereignty|sovereigntist]] platform and severed its ties with the federal NDP. Under McLaughlin, the party did manage to win an election in Quebec for the first time when Edmonston won a 1990 by-election.  The party had briefly picked up its first Quebec MP in 1986, when [[Robert Toupin]] [[crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] from the Tories after briefly sitting as an independent.  However, he left the party in October 1987 after claiming Communists had infiltrated the party.

The NDP chose to align itself with the Conservatives and Liberals on the "yes" side of the [[Charlottetown Accord]] referendum in 1992. Barrett reluctantly endorsed it to comply with party policy (he opposed the [[Meech Lake Accord]] in 1987), but later referred to the NDP's support for the Accord as a mistake. Edmonston, a [[Quebec nationalist]], frequently clashed with his own party over this position on [[Canadian federalism]], and did not run for re-election.

The NDP was routed in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 election]]. It won only nine seats, three seats short of [[official party status]] in the House of Commons. Several factors contributed to this dramatic collapse just one election after winning a record number of seats and after being first in opinion polling at one point during the previous Parliament. One was the massive unpopularity of NDP provincial governments under [[Bob Rae]] in Ontario and [[Mike Harcourt]] in British Columbia. Not coincidentally, the NDP was routed in these provinces; it lost all 10 of its Ontario MPs and 17 of its 19 British Columbia MPs—more than half of its caucus.  The Ontario NDP would be soundly defeated in 1995, while the British Columbia NDP recovered and won reelection in 1996.

The NDP was also indirectly hampered by the collapse of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]], who were cut down to only two seats.  Exit polls showed that 17% to 27% of NDP supporters from 1988 voted Liberal in 1993. It was obvious by the beginning of October that Liberal leader [[Jean Chrétien]] would be the next prime minister. However, the memory of 1988's vote splitting combined with the tremendous antipathy toward the PCs caused NDP supporters to vote Liberal to ensure the Conservatives would be defeated. Many voters in the NDP's traditional Western heartland also switched to the right-wing [[Reform Party of Canada]].  Despite sharp ideological differences, Reform's populism struck a chord with many western NDP supporters. In Ontario, fear of the Reform Party and anger at Rae helped cause NDP supporters to vote Liberal.  Barrett's warnings about Western alienation proved to be prophetic, as the rise of the Reform Party replaced the NDP as the protest voice west of Ontario.

==Into the 21st century==

===Recovery===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:NDP90s.PNG|frame|right|NDP logo under Alexa McDonough]] --&gt;
The party recovered somewhat under new leader [[Alexa McDonough]],  electing 21 New Democrats in the [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997 election]]. The NDP made a breakthrough in Atlantic Canada, unseating Liberal ministers [[David Dingwall]] and [[Doug Young (politician)|Doug Young]]. The party was able to harness the discontent of Maritime voters, who were upset over cuts to employment insurance and other programs.

Afterwards, McDonough was widely perceived as trying to move the party toward the centre of the political spectrum, in the [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] mode of [[Tony Blair]]. Union leaders were lukewarm in their support, often threatening to break away from the NDP, while [[Canadian Auto Workers]] head [[Buzz Hargrove]] called for her resignation. MPs [[Rick Laliberté]] and [[Angela Vautour]] crossed the floor to other parties during this term, reducing the NDP caucus to 19 seats.

In the November [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 election]], the NDP campaigned on the issue of Medicare but lost significant support.   The governing Liberals ran an effective campaign on their economic record and managed to recapture some of the Atlantic ridings lost to the NDP in the 1997 election. The initial high electoral prospects of the [[Canadian Alliance]] under new leader [[Stockwell Day]] also hurt the NDP as many supporters strategically voted Liberal to keep the Alliance from winning. The NDP finished with 13 MPs — just barely over the threshold for official party status.

The party embarked on a renewal process starting in 2000. A general convention in [[Winnipeg]] in November 2001 made significant alterations to party structures, and reaffirmed its commitment to the left. In the May 2002 by-elections, [[Brian Masse]] won the riding of [[Windsor West]] in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]], previously held for decades by a Liberal, former [[Deputy Prime Minister of Canada|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Herb Gray]].

===Jack Layton elected leader===
[[Image:Jack Layton-cr bl.jpg|left|thumb|225px|Jack Layton, Leader: 2003-2011]]

McDonough announced her resignation as party leader for family reasons in June 2002, and was succeeded by [[Jack Layton]]. A Toronto city councillor and recent President of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, Layton was elected at the party's [[New Democratic Party leadership election, 2003|leadership election]] in Toronto on January 5, 2003, defeating his nearest rival, longtime Winnipeg-area MP [[Bill Blaikie]], on the first ballot with 53.5% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/features/ndp_leadership/ CBC News - Indepth Backgrounder: NDP Leadership Race&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Layton had run unsuccessfully for the Commons three times in Toronto-area ridings.  In contrast to traditional but diminishing Canadian practice, where an MP for a safe seat stands down to allow a newly elected leader a chance to enter Parliament, Layton did not contest a seat in Parliament until the 2004 election.  In the interim, he appointed Blaikie as deputy leader and made him parliamentary leader of the NDP.

====2004 election====
The [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 election]] produced mixed results for the NDP. It increased its total vote by more than a million votes; however, despite Layton's optimistic predictions of reaching 40 seats, the NDP only gained five seats in the election, for a total of 19. The party was disappointed to see its two [[Saskatchewan]] incumbents defeated by the Conservatives, both in close races,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadian-politics.com/parties/parties_NDP.shtml The New Democratic Party&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps due to the unpopularity of the NDP provincial government. Those losses caused the federal NDP to be shut out in Saskatchewan for the first time since the [[Canadian federal election, 1965|1965 election]], despite obtaining 23% of the vote in the province.

Exit polls indicated that many NDP supporters voted Liberal to keep the new [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] from winning.  The Liberals had recruited several prominent NDP members, most notably former [[British Columbia]] premier [[Ujjal Dosanjh]], to run as Liberals as part of a drive to convince NDP voters that a reunited Conservative Party could sneak up the middle in the event of a split in the centre-left vote.

The Liberals were re-elected, though this time as a [[minority government]].  Combined, the Liberals and NDP had 154 seats—one short of the total needed for the balance of power. As has been the case with Liberal [[minority government]]s in the past, the NDP were in a position to make gains on the party's priorities, such as fighting health care [[privatization]], fulfilling Canada's obligation to the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and [[electoral reform]].

The party used Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]]'s politically precarious position caused by the [[sponsorship scandal]] to force investment in multiple federal programs, agreeing not to help topple the government provided that some major concessions in the federal budget were ceded to.  The governing Liberals agreed to support the changes in exchange for NDP support on [[motion of Confidence|confidence votes]]. On May 19, 2005, by [[Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada|Speaker]] [[Peter Milliken]]'s tie-breaking vote, the House of Commons voted for [[second reading]] on major NDP amendments to the federal budget, preempting about $4.5 billion in [[corporate tax]] cuts and funding social, educational and environmental programs instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/budget2005/liberal-ndp-deal.html CBC News Indepth: Budget 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Both NDP supporters and Conservative opponents of the measures branded it Canada's first "NDP budget". In late June, the amendments passed final reading and many political pundits concluded that the NDP had gained credibility and clout on the national scene.

====2006 election====
On November 9, 2005, after the findings of the [[Gomery Inquiry]] were released, Layton notified the Liberal government that continued NDP support would require a ban on private health care. When the Liberals refused, Layton announced that he would introduce a motion on November 24 that would ask Martin to call a federal election in February to allow for several pieces of legislation to be passed. The Liberals turned down this offer.  On November 28, 2005, Conservative leader [[Stephen Harper]]'s motion of no confidence was seconded by Layton and it was passed by all three opposition parties, forcing an election. Columnist [[Andrew Coyne]] has suggested that the NDP was unlikely to receive much credit for continuing to further prop up the Liberals, so they ended their support for the Martin government.

During the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|election]], the NDP focused their attacks on the Liberal party, in order to counter Liberal appeals for [[strategic voting]]. A key point in the campaign was when [[Judy Wasylycia-Leis]] had asked the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) to launch a criminal investigation into the leaking of the income trust announcement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060121/election_turningpoints_060121?s_name=election2006&amp;no_ads= CTV.ca | Income trust a major campaign turning point&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116032918/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060121/election_turningpoints_060121?s_name=election2006&amp;no_ads= |date=2009-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The criminal probe seriously damaged the Liberal campaign and prevented them from making their key policy announcements, as well as bringing Liberal corruption back into the spotlight. After the election, the RCMP announced the conclusion of the income trust investigation and laid a charge of 'Breach of Trust' against [[Serge Nadeau]], an official in the Department of Finance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.gc.ca/cfmx/view/en/index.jsp?articleid=276859 Canada News Centre - Centre des nouvelles du Canada&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] Finance Minister [[Ralph Goodale]] was cleared of wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=98a291f4-69a5-4862-8117-6fbe609f5b2a&amp;k=36017 Goodale cleared in trust case&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214202935/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=98a291f4-69a5-4862-8117-6fbe609f5b2a&amp;k=36017 |date=2012-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NDP campaign strategy put them at odds with [[Canadian Auto Workers]], which had supported an NDP-backed Liberal minority government and which was only backing NDP candidates that had a chance of winning. After the campaign, the Ontario NDP expelled CAW leader Buzz Hargrove from the party (which has a common membership both federally and provincially) for his support of the Liberals.

On January 23, the NDP won 29 seats, a significant increase of 10 seats from the 19 won in 2004. It was the fourth-best performance in party history, approaching the level of popular support enjoyed in the 1980s. The NDP kept all of the 18 seats it held at the dissolution of Parliament ([[Paul Dewar]] retained the riding of [[Ottawa Centre]] vacated by Broadbent). [[Bev Desjarlais]], an NDP MP since 1997, unsuccessfully ran as an independent in her [[Churchill (electoral district)|Churchill]] riding after losing the NDP nomination. While the party gained no seats in Atlantic Canada, Quebec, or the Prairie Provinces, it gained five seats in British Columbia, five more in Ontario and the [[Western Arctic]] riding of the [[Northwest Territories]].

====Conservative minority====
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=April 2013}}
The [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] won a minority government in the 2006 election, and initially the NDP was the only party that would not be able to pass legislation with the Conservatives. However, following a series of [[crossing the floor|floor crossings]], the NDP also came to hold the balance of power.

There have been four confidence votes in the current parliament, and the NDP is the only party to have voted against the Conservatives on all of them. These were votes on the [[United States-Canada softwood lumber dispute]], extending the mission to [[Afghanistan]], the [[2006 Canadian federal budget]] and 2007 federal budget. On other issues the NDP has worked with the Conservatives.  After forcing the Conservatives to agree to certain revisions, the NDP helped pass the [[Federal Accountability Act|Accountability Act]]. After the NDP fiercely criticized the initial Conservative attempt at a [[Air quality law|Clean Air Act]], the Conservatives agreed to work with the NDP and other parties to revise the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/11/01/layton-green.html Harper agrees to send Clean Air Act to committee]&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Ed Broadbent and Jack Layton at Toronto Rally.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ed Broadbent]] and [[Jack Layton]] at a [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 election]] rally in [[Toronto]]]] The NDP also supported the government in introducing regulations on [[Income trust#The Conservatives propose new rules for income trusts|income trust]]s, fearing that trends toward mass trust conversions by large corporations to avoid Canadian income taxes would cause the loss of billions of dollars in budget revenue to support health care, pensions and other federal programs. At the same time, the NDP was also weary of the threat of investor losses from income trusts’ exaggerated performance expectations.

Since that election, the NDP caucus rose to 30 members following the victory of NDP candidate [[Thomas Mulcair]] in a [[Outremont by-election, 2007|by-election in Outremont]]. This marked the second time ever (and first time in seventeen years) that the NDP won a riding in Quebec.  The party won 37 seats in the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 federal election]], the second most seats won, since the [[1988 Canadian election|1988 federal election]] record of 43.

===Historic Breakthrough and Official Opposition===

In the May 2011 election, the [[Jack Layton]]-led NDP suddenly experienced a surge in the polls, catapulting them from third-party status to the role of [[Official Opposition]] for the first time in history. The historic results began as a surge in poll numbers in [[Quebec]] for the NDP, putting the party in first place in that province and in second place nationally (just a few points behind the Tories). This NDP surge (dubbed the "Orange Crush" by the media, after the [[Crush (beverage)|soft drink]]) was mirrored by a collapse in support for the [[Bloc Québécois]] in Quebec, and a collapse of support for the Liberals nationally as the progressive non-Conservative vote coalesced around the NDP. 
This resulted in the worst electoral result ever received by the federal Liberal party (being reduced to just 34 seats), the worst results for the Bloc Québécois (being reduced to 4 seats), and a shift and realignment of the Canadian political landscape as the NDP (previously a third party) was returned to Parliament with an unprecedented 103 seats (59 of which came from Quebec), allowing them replace the Liberal Party as Official Opposition and become the main [[centre-left]] non-Conservative party.

Just a few months later, in August 2011, Jack Layton died. The subsequent leadership contest elected [[Thomas Mulcair]] (from the Quebec riding of [[Outremont]]) as the new and current leader of the New Democratic Party. After the election of Thomas Mulcair, multiple polls put the NDP in first place nationally (and in Quebec), ahead of the governing Conservatives. This marked the first time that the NDP was not only in first place statistically, but by such a significant margin. In Quebec, the NDP climbed to over 50% support. As the governing Conservatives became less and less popular, the NDP surged and held on to first place{{when|date=October 2015}} (while the Liberals' support continued to wane{{when|date=October 2015}}). The NDP is in first place nationally, and provincially in [[Quebec]], [[Ontario]], [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Yukon]] and, as of recently{{when|date=October 2015}} [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. At the start of the [[Canadian federal election, 2015|2015 campaign]], the NDP led in the polls, but their support declined as the campaign went on. In the end, they were reduced to 44 seats, with the majority of their losses being to the Liberals in Quebec, Ontario, and Atlantic Canada.

The '''Hukbalahap''' ({{lang-fil|'''Huk'''bong '''Ba'''yan '''La'''ban sa '''Hap'''on}}, ''The Nation's Army Against the Japanese Soldiers''), or ''Hukbong Laban sa Hapon'' (Anti-Japanese Army), was a [[Communism|communist]] [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla movement]] formed by the peasant farmers of Central [[Luzon]].  They are popularly known as "Huks". They were originally formed to fight the Japanese, but extended their fight into a rebellion against the Philippine Government, known as the [[Hukbalahap Rebellion]], in 1946. It was put down through a series of reforms and military victories by Filipino President [[Ramon Magsaysay]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Goodwin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VdIFfPqP29IC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=huk+rebellion&amp;source=web&amp;ots=a7ZAHcg3tM&amp;sig=RrfKkc2qerafo44P-DFvk72YGlc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result#PPA119,M1  No Other Way Out], Cambridge University Press, 2001, p.119, {{ISBN|0-521-62948-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-62948-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
As originally constituted in 1942, the Hukbalahap was to be part of a broad [[united front]] resistance to the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name="Saulo" /&gt;{{rp|31}} This original intent is reflected in its name:  ''"Hukbong Bayan Laban sa mga Hapon"'', which means "People's Army Against the Japanese."

By 1950, the [[Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930|Communist Party of the Philippines]] (PKP) had resolved to reconstitute the organization as the armed wing of a revolutionary party, prompting a change in the official name to ''Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan,'' &lt;ref name="Saulo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saulo|first1=Alfredo|title=Communism in the Philippines: An Introduction|date=1990|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|location=Quezon City|isbn=971-550-403-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}} (HMB) or "Peoples' Liberation Army," likely in emulation of the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]].

Notwithstanding this name change, the HMB continued to be popularly known as the ''Hukbalahap,'' and the English-speaking press continued to refer to it and its members, interchangeably, as "The Huks" during the whole period between 1945 and 1952.

==Background==
The Hukbalahap movement has deep roots in the Spanish ''[[encomienda]]'', a system of grants to reward soldiers who had conquered [[New Spain]], established in 1570. This developed into a system of exploitation. In the 19th century, Filipino landlordism, under the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish colonization]], arose and, with it, further abuses.&lt;ref name=Taruc&gt;Taruc, L., 1967, He Who Rides the Tiger, London: Geoffrey Chapman Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|57}} After the opening of ports in Manila, the Luzon economy was transformed to meet the demands for exports of rice, sugar, and tobacco. Landowners increased demands on farmers, who rented parcels of land. These demands included increased rents, demands for proceeds from the sale of crops, and predatory lending agreements to fund farm improvements.&lt;ref name="Lanzona"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lanzona|first1=Vina A.|title=Amazons of the Huk rebellion gender, sex, and revolution in the Philippines|date=2009|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wis.|isbn=9780299230937|edition=[Online-Ausg.].|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/8683|accessdate=10 September 2016}}{{subscription required|via=[https://muse.jhu.edu/ Project MUSE]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24, 26}} Only after the coming of the Americans were reforms initiated to lessen tensions between tenants and landlords. The reforms, however, did not solve the problems and, with growing political consciousness produced by education, peasants began to unite under educated but poor leaders. The most potent of these organizations was the Hukbalahap, which began as a resistance organization against the Japanese but ended as an anti-government resistance movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Agoncillo1990|p=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inception during the Second World War==
The idea of a guerrilla organization was conceived as early as October 1941, months before the Philippines' entry to World War II.&lt;ref name="Saulo"/&gt;{{rp|30}} As early as 1941, [[Juan Feleo]], a well-known peasant leader and member of the [[Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas]], had begun to mobilize peasants in his home province of [[Nueva Ecija]] for the conflict. [[Pedro Abad Santos]], founding member of the Socialist Party of the Philippines, had also ordered [[Luis Taruc]] to mobilize forces in Pampanga.&lt;ref name="Saulo"/&gt;{{rp|31–32}}

At the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in the Philippines and the capture of Manila, top-ranking leaders of the PKP were captured by the Japanese military. [[Crisanto Evangelista]], its founder, was among those who were captured and was executed in 1942. Abad Santos was similarly captured, but was released in 1943.&lt;ref name="Lanzona"/&gt;{{rp|37}} Dr. [[Vicente Lava]] took the reins of the PKP and tried to re-organize the party.

In February 1942 a "struggle conference" was held in [[Cabiao, Nueva Ecija|Cabiao]], [[Nueva Ecija]] to discuss organization, strategy, and tactics.&lt;ref name="Saulo"/&gt;{{rp|31}} Members of the PKP, the Popular Front Party, the League for the Defense of Democracy, KPMP, AMT, and KAP convened to create a structure for unified resistance against the Japanese.&lt;ref name="Lanzona"/&gt;{{rp|38}}

A united front tactic was agreed upon as a means of attracting the broadest sections of population, not necessarily communists. A three-front resistance was agreed upon: military, political, and economic. The military aim was to harass the Japanese continuously and keep it off-balance so as to prevent it from focusing on activities aimed at winning the goodwill of the people. The political aim was to discredit the [[Second Philippine Republic|Japanese-sponsored republic]] and build the concept of a functioning democracy as a grass roots level, while the economic objective was to prevent the enemy's looting.&lt;ref name="Saulo"/&gt;{{rp|31}} The result was the creation of the Central Luzon Bureau, an organization meant to lead resistance against the Japanese. Key positions were filled out as follows:&lt;ref name="Lanzona"/&gt;{{rp|38}}

At the advent of this conference, several armed groups were immediately organized and began operating in Central Luzon. A significant event was on March 13, 1942, when a squadron headed by Felipa Culala (alias Dayang-Dayang) encountered and defeated Japanese forces in Mandili, [[Candaba, Pampanga]].&lt;ref name="Saulo"/&gt;{{rp|32}} News of Culala's successful raid raised morale for resistance fighters.&lt;ref name="Kerkvliet"/&gt;{{rp|63}}

On March 29, 1942, peasant leaders met in a forest clearing located in Sitio Bawit, Barrio San Julian,  at the junction of [[Tarlac]], [[Pampanga]], and [[Nueva Ecija]] to form a united organization. ''Hukbong Bayan Laban sa mga Hapon'' was chosen as the name of the organization. After the meeting, a military committee was formed with Taruc (''Supremo''), Castro Alejandrino (Vice Commander), Bernardo Poblete (''Tandang Banal''), and Culala as members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|p=448}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hukbalahap high command was also joined by the military commissariat; a party apparatus that provided guidance to the Huks.&lt;ref name="Saulo"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

The CLB was regarded as the "wartime version of the PKP".&lt;ref name="Saulo"/&gt;{{rp|31}} While PKP officials did assume important positions in the Huk structure, the movement encompassed more that simply members of the PKP and its affiliated organizations.&lt;ref name="Kerkvliet"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Huk Rebellion: A Study of Peasant Revolt in the Philippines| publisher=University of California Press | author=Kerkvliet, Benjamin | year=1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Lapham]] reports either Luis Taruc or Casto Alejandrino met with Col. Thorpe at his Camp Sanchez in the spring of 1942, and the conferees agreed to cooperate, share equipment and supplies, with the Americans providing trainers.&lt;ref name=Lapham&gt;Lapham, R., and Norling, B., 1996, Lapham's Raiders, Lexington: The University Press of Kentucky, {{ISBN|0813119499}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21,128–129}}  However, though the Huks fought the Japanese, they also "tried to thwart [[United States Army Forces in the Far East]] guerrillas", "therefore, they were considered disloyal and were not accorded U.S. recognition or benefits at the end of the war."&lt;ref name=Lapham/&gt;{{rp|233}}

After its inception, the group grew quickly and by late summer 1943 claimed to have 15,000 to 20,000 active men and women military fighters and 50,000 more in reserve. These fighters' weaponry was obtained primarily by stealing it from battlefields and downed planes left behind by the Japanese, Filipinos and Americans.&lt;ref name="Lanzona" /&gt;{{rp|37}} They fought Japanese troops, worked to subvert the Japanese tax-collection service, intercepted food and supplies to the Japanese troops, and created a training school where they taught political theory and military tactics based on Marxist ideas. In areas that the group controlled, they set up local governments (''Sandatahang Tanod ng Bayan'', Barrio United Defense Corps) and instituted land reforms, dividing up the largest estates equally among the peasants and often killing the landlords. In some cases, however, landlords were welcomed as participants in Huk resistance, swayed by anti-Japanese sympathies.&lt;ref name="Lanzona" /&gt;{{rp|38}} PKP organizers quickly went to work to set up BUDCs in Huk controlled barrios, which contributed to its success as a resistance army,&lt;ref name="Saulo"/&gt; although in reality there was an overlap between independently formed barrio governments, "neighborhood committees" set up by the Japanese, and BUDCs.&lt;ref name="Kerkvliet"/&gt;

The Huk movement was notable for its inclusion of women peasants, who advocated for inclusion in the movement in resistance to word of Japanese war atrocities against women, including rape and mutilation. Many of these women fought, but the majority of the resistance remained in villages, collecting supplies and intelligence.&lt;ref name="Lanzona" /&gt;{{rp|41}} Women in the forest camps were forbidden from entering combat,&lt;ref name="Lanzona" /&gt;{{rp|52}} but often trained in first aid, communication/propaganda, and recruitment tactics.&lt;ref name="Lanzona" /&gt;{{rp|50}}

The Huks enjoyed early successes with their continuous attacks, aimed at raising morale through quick successes as well as to acquire weapons for the severely unarmed group. The Japanese conducted two counterattacks against the Huks, on September 6 and December 5, 1942. Both attacks did nothing to dampen the frequency of Huk raids, and only served to intensify Huk operations. On March 5, 1943, the Japanese struck the Huk headquarters in Cabiao, Nueva Ecija in a surprise attack. A large number of CPP cadres and Huk soldiers were captured during the raid. By the end of the war, the Huks had 1,200 engagements, and inflicted some 25,000 enemy casualties. The Huks' strength consisted of 20,000 fully armed regulars and some 50,000 [[reservist]]s.&lt;ref name="Saulo"/&gt;

===Relationship with other guerrillas===
The Hukhbalahap's methods were often portrayed by other guerrilla leaders as terrorist; for example, [[Ray C. Hunt]], an American who led his own band of 3000 guerrillas, said of the Hukbalahap that&lt;ref&gt;Breuer, William B. ''The Great Raid: Rescuing the Doomed Ghosts of Bataan and Corregidor''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My experiences with the Huks were always unpleasant. Those I knew were much better assassins than soldiers. Tightly disciplined and led by fanatics, they murdered some Filipino landlords and drove others off to the comparative safety of Manila. They were not above plundering and torturing ordinary Filipinos, and they were treacherous enemies of all other guerrillas (on Luzon).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the Hukbalahap claimed that it extended its [[guerrilla warfare]] campaign for over a decade merely in search of recognition as World War II freedom fighters and former American and Filipino allies who deserved a share of war reparations.

==Post-War and Rebellion==
{{main|Hukbalahap Rebellion}}
[[File:Hukbalahap Veterans Card.jpg|thumb|right|Hukbalahap Veteran's Card]]
The end of the war saw the return of American forces in the Philippines. The Americans, with the help of [[United States Army Forces in the Far East|USAFFE]] guerillas and former [[Philippine Constabulary|PC]] members, forcibly disarmed Huk squadrons while charging other guerrillas of treason, sedition, and subversive activity, leading to the arrests of Luis Taruc and Casto Alejandrino in 1945, as well as incidents such as the massacre of 109 Huk guerrillas in [[Malolos, Bulacan]].&lt;ref name="Kerkvliet"/&gt;

On September 1945, President [[Sergio Osmeña]] released Taruc, Alejandrino, and other Huk leaders from prison. The PKP, through Huk leaders, then formally disbanded the movement and formed the Hukbalahap Veterans' League in an effort to get the Hukbalahap recognized as a legitimate guerrilla movement. Alejandrino was its nominal chairman.&lt;ref name="Saulo"/&gt;

In 1946, peasants in Central Luzon backed members of the [[Democratic Alliance (Philippines)|Democratic Alliance]] in that year's election, with six candidates eventually winning seats in the Senate. Among these candidates was Luis Taruc. However, they were blocked from sitting in Congress by the government, which only exacerbated negative sentiment among the peasants in Central Luzon. The new Roxas administration attempted a pacification program, with help from Taruc, Alejandrino, [[Juan Feleo]], and other representatives. They would be accompanied by MP guards and government officials to try and pacify peasant groups, however this did not result in any sort of success. Within days of the so-called "truce", violence once again erupted in Central Luzon. Taruc and others claimed that civilian guards and government officials were "sabotaging the peace process".&lt;ref name="Kerkvliet"/&gt;

On August 24, 1946, Feleo was stopped by a large band of "armed men in fatigue uniforms" in [[Gapan, Nueva Ecija]]. He had planned present the peasant's concerns to the Secretary of the Interior [[Jose Zulueta]], before he was taken and killed. Thousands of Huk veterans and PKM members were sure that Feleo was murdered by landlords, or possibly the Roxas administration itself.&lt;ref name="Kerkvliet"/&gt; The incident led to Taruc joining the peasants and re-igniting the insurrection. The Roxas administration then outlawed the Hukbalahap on March 6, 1948.&lt;ref name="Saulo"/&gt;

In 1949, Hukbalahap members ambushed and murdered [[Aurora Quezon]], Chairman of the [[Philippine Red Cross]] and widow of the Philippines' second president, [[Manuel L. Quezon]], as she was en route to her hometown for the dedication of the Quezon Memorial Hospital.&lt;ref name=mm0&gt;Martinez, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  Several others were also killed, including her eldest daughter and son-in-law.  This attack brought worldwide condemnation of the Hukbalahaps, who claimed that the attack was done by "renegade" members.&lt;ref name=mm0&gt;Martinez, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; The continuing condemnation and new post-war causes of the movement prompted the Huk leaders to adopt a new name, the 'Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan' or the 'People's Liberation Army' in 1950.

Public sympathies for the movement had been waning due to their postwar attacks. The Huks carried out a campaign of raids, holdups, robbery, ambushes, murder, rape, massacre of small villages, kidnapping and intimidation. The Huks confiscated funds and property to sustain their movement and relied on small village organizers for political and material support. The Huk movement was mainly spread in the central provinces of Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac, Bulacan, and in Nueva Vizcaya, Pangasinan, Laguna, Bataan and Quezon.

An important movement in the campaign against the Huks was the deployment of hunter-killer counter guerrilla special units. The "Nenita" unit (1946&amp;ndash;1949) was the first of such special forces whose main mission was to eliminate the Huks. The Nenita Force was commanded by Major Napoleon Valeriano. The Nenita terror tactics which were not only committed against dissidents but also towards law-abiding people sometimes helped the Huks gain supporters as a consequence.

In July 1950, Major Valeriano assumed command of the elite 7th Battalion Combat Team (BCT) in [[Bulacan]]. The 7th BCT would develop a reputation toward employing a more comprehensive, more unconventional counterinsurgency strategy and reduced the random brutality against the civilian population.

In June 1950, American alarm over the Huk rebellion during the Cold War prompted [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] to approve special military assistance that included military advice, sale at cost of military equipment to the Philippines and financial aid under the Joint United States Military Advisory Group (JUSMAG).  On 26 Aug. 1950, in an "anniversary celebration" of the [[Cry of Pugad Lawin]], the Huks temporarily seized [[Santa Cruz, Laguna]] and Camp Makabulos, Tarlac, confiscating money, food, weapons, ammunition, clothing, medicine, and office supplies.&lt;ref name=Taruc/&gt;{{rp|85–86}}  In September 1950, former [[USAFFE]] guerrilla, [[Ramon Magsaysay]] was appointed as Minister of National Defense on American advice. With the Huk Rebellion growing in strength and the security situation in the Philippines becoming seriously threatened, Magsaysay urged President [[Elpidio Quirino]] to suspend the writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' for the duration of the Huk campaign.  On 18 Oct. 1950, Magsaysay captured the Secretariat, including the general secretary Jose Lava, following the earlier capture of the Politburo in Manila.&lt;ref name=Taruc/&gt;{{rp|90}} 
 
American assistance allowed Magsaysay to create more BCTs, bringing the total to twenty-six. By 1951, army strength had increased by 60 percent over the previous year with 1,047-man BCTs. Major military offensive campaigns against the Huks were carried out by the 7th, 16th, 17th, and 22nd BCTs.

Another major effort against the Huks was Operation "Knockout" of the Panay Task Force (composed of the 15th BCT, some elements of the 9th BCT and the [[Philippine Constabulary]] commands of Iloilo, Capiz and Antique) under the command of Colonel [[Alfredo M. Santos]]. The  Operation conducted a surprise attack on Guillermo Capadocia, commander of the Huk Regional Command in the Visayas, erstwhile Secretary General and one of the founders of the PKP. Santos' masterstroke was the enlistment of Pedro Valentin, a local mountain leader who knew the people and the terrain like the back of his hand. Capadocia died on [[Panay]],&lt;ref name=Taruc/&gt;{{rp|98}} of battle wounds, on September 20, 1952.

In 1954, Lt. Col. Laureño Maraña, the former head of Force X of the 16th PC Company, assumed command of the 7th BCT, which had become one of the most mobile striking forces of the Philippine ground forces against the Huks, from Valeriano who was now a colonel. Force X employed psychological warfare through combat intelligence and infiltration that relied on secrecy in planning, training, and execution of attack. The lessons learned from Force X and Nenita were combined in the 7th BCT.

With the all out anti-dissidence campaigns against the Huks, they numbered less than 2,000 by 1954 and without the protection and support of local supporters, active Huk resistance no longer presented a serious threat to Philippine security. From February to mid-September 1954, the largest anti-Huk operation, "Operation Thunder-Lightning" was conducted and resulted in the surrender of Luis Taruc on May 17. Further cleanup operations of guerillas remaining lasted throughout 1955, diminishing its number to less than 1,000 by year's end.

==Organization==
The Hukbalahap was regarded by the PKP as its "citizen's army" against the Japanese.&lt;ref name="Saulo"/&gt;{{rp|31}} It was headed by the Central Luzon Bureau, with [[Vicente Lava]] as its secretary, and a secretariat, ostensibly a party apparatus meant to keep the Huks in line with PKP ideology. There were five committees which composed the Huk structure:&lt;ref name="Lanzona"/&gt;{{rp|38}}
#'''Finance and Provisions''' – responsible for supplying provisions and other necessities to the guerrillas.
#'''Organization and Communication''' – responsible for coordinating the relationship between the leadership and its support base.
#'''Military Committee''' – responsible for the guerrilla's army regiments.
#'''Intelligence and Education''' – responsible for political education and information on enemy activity, and
#'''United Front''' – responsible for propaganda and mobilizing support.

The Huk military structured was modeled after the [[Chinese Red Army]]. It was composed of squads and platoons, consisting of 100 officers and men, which formed a squadron. Two squadrons formed one battalion, and two battalions formed a regiment.&lt;ref name="Saulo"/&gt;{{rp|32}} These numbers were not always followed though: For example, Squadron 8, based in [[Talavera, Nueva Ecija]], had twelve squads, each with a dozen men.&lt;ref name="Kerkvliet"/&gt;{{rp|70}}

The initial force of 500 armed Huks which was organized into five squadrons had increased to a fully armed guerrilla force of 20,000 men.&lt;ref name="Lanzona" /&gt;{{rp|40}} By 1944, Huk strength numbers at 76 squadrons.&lt;ref name="Kerkvliet"/&gt;{{rp|87}} After the Cabiao raid by the Japanese, the PKP adopted a "retreat for defense" policy, which broke up squads to smaller groups of three to five men.&lt;ref name="Saulo"/&gt;{{rp|34}}

In areas controlled by Huk guerrillas, the Huks organized an ad-hoc police force to keep the peace and stop looters and thieves.&lt;ref name="Kerkvliet"/&gt;{{rp|70}} Huks also formed ''Sandatahang Tanod ng Bayan'' (Barrio United Defense Corps), which acted as neighborhood governments in support of the Huk forces in the field. These BUDC's were composed of KPMP and AMT members, which organized popular support for Huks, shielded harvest from the Japanese, and attacked Filipino collaborators; in effect, setting up protected zones and safe havens for the Huks.&lt;ref name="Lanzona"/&gt;{{rp|40}} The Hukbalahap also set-up a government, composed of a President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, and five policemen.

"'''I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)'''" is a pop song that originated as the [[jingle]] "Buy the World a Coke"&lt;ref&gt;{{discogs release|2150178|The New Seekers: Buy The World a Coke (single release)}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the groundbreaking 1971 "Hilltop" television commercial for [[Coca-Cola]]. "Buy the World a Coke" was produced by [[Billy Davis (songwriter)|Billy Davis]] and portrayed a positive message of hope and love, featuring a multicultural collection of teenagers on top of a hill appearing to sing the song.

The popularity of the jingle led to it being re-recorded by [[The New Seekers]] and by [[The Hillside Singers]] as a full-length song, dropping references to Coca-Cola. The song became a hit record in the US and the UK.

==Origins==
The idea originally came to [[Bill Backer]], an advertising executive working for [[McCann Erickson]], the agency responsible for [[Coca-Cola]]. Backer, [[Roger Cook (songwriter)|Roger Cook]] and [[Billy Davis (songwriter)|Billy Davis]] were delayed at [[Shannon Airport]] in Ireland. After a forced layover with many hot tempers, they noticed their fellow travelers the next morning were talking and joking while drinking Coca-Cola. Backer wrote the line "I'd like to buy the world a Coke" on a napkin and shared it with British hit songwriters Cook and [[Roger Greenaway]]. 

The melody was derived from a previous jingle by [[Roger Cook (songwriter)|Cook]] and [[Roger Greenaway|Greenaway]], originally called "True Love and Apple Pie"&lt;ref name="coke_hilltop"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan |first=Ted |url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coke-lore-hilltop-story#TCCC |title=The Making of Coca-Cola's "I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke" Ad |publisher=The Coca-Cola Company |date=2012-01-01 |accessdate=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was recorded in 1971 by Susan Shirley.

The commercial ended with the statement:

{{blockindent|1=
&lt;poem&gt;
On a hilltop in Italy,
We assembled young people
From all over the world...
To bring you this message
From Coca-Cola Bottlers
All over the world.
It's the real thing.  Coke.
&lt;/poem&gt;
}}

The song became so popular that it was recorded by [[The New Seekers]] and by [[The Hillside Singers]] as a full-length song—without the mention of Coke—and both versions became huge hits. A version of the song was rerecorded by Susan Shirley and released in 1971. Cook, Greenaway, Backer, and Billy Davis reworked the song and recorded it as a Coca-Cola radio commercial.

==TV commercial==

===Lyrics===
"Buy the World a Coke" contains the line "I'd like to buy the world a Coke" and
repeats "It's the real thing", which was Coca-Cola's marketing slogan at the time.  Coca
Cola introduced that slogan in October 1969.

===Versions as an ad===
Several versions of the ad have been made.

*The song first aired on American radio on February 12, 1971, but failed.{{clarify|date=July 2016}}&lt;ref name="coke_hilltop"/&gt; When the feedback was favorable, Backer persuaded [[McCann-Erickson]] to film a commercial using the song.&lt;ref name="coke_hilltop"/&gt; The TV commercial, titled "Hilltop", was directed by Roberto Malenotti.&lt;ref name="Coca Cola Hilltop"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.coloribus.com/adsarchive/tv-commercials/coca-cola-hilltop-2236655/ |website=Coloribus|title=Coca Cola "Hilltop"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ad cost $250,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.25|1971|r=1|fmt=c}} million today), the most expensive commercial in history at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/18/mad-men-s-series-finale-don-draper-s-moment-of-zen-and-the-betrayal-of-peggy.html |title= Mad Men’s Series Finale: Don Draper’s Moment of Zen and the Betrayal of Peggy |publisher= The Daily Beast |author= Marlow Stern |date= 18 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The first attempt at shooting was ruined by rain and other location problems.&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/ccmphtml/colaadv.html |title=Moving Image Research Center (Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division, Library of Congress) |website=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date=2016-07-14 |accessdate=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The finished product, first aired in July 1971, featured a multicultural group of young people [[lip sync]]ing the song on a hill in [[Manziana]], outside Rome, Italy. The global unity of the singers is emphasized by showing that the bottles of Coke they are holding are labelled in a variety of languages.  The [[South Africa]]n government asked for a version of the commercial without the black actors. Coca Cola refused their request. The company later reduced its investment in that country with the (then) CEO saying "We have been reducing our investment in South Africa since 1976, and we have now decided to sell our remaining holdings in that country".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1986-09-18/news/mn-11241_1_south-africa|title=Coca-Cola Acts to Cut All Ties With S. Africa|last=Sing|first=Bill|date=18 September 1986|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In the mid-1970s, another version of the commercial was filmed for the holiday season. This reworking featured the same song but showed the group at night, with each person holding a lit white candle. In the final zoom-out [[crane shot]], only the candle flames remain visible, forming a triangle reminiscent of a [[Christmas tree]]; this impression is cemented by a Coke bottle logo superimposed at the top of the "tree", and the words "Happy Holidays from your Coca-Cola bottler" below. This version was reused for many years during the holiday season.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
*Starting in 1983, for several years, the Christmas version, translated into Italian, was broadcast in Italy.
*Yet another variation had a different ending, with [[Mickey Mouse]] and other Disney characters decorating a giant Christmas tree in front of the [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]] before the establishing crane shot captures an animated [[Tinker Bell#Disney|Tinker Bell]] lighting it up with her wand.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
*In 1990, a follow-up to this commercial, called "Hilltop Reunion" and directed by Jeff Lovinger, aired during coverage of [[Super Bowl XXIV]]. It featured the original singers (now adults) and their children, and culminated in a medley of this song and the then-current "Can't Beat the Real Thing" jingle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dale, Arden |date=December 22, 1989|title='Hilltop Reunion' has McCann and Coke Humming|work=[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1996 the hilltop commercial was referenced in the rap lyrics of the "Get Real" Coca-Cola campaign. 
*[[G. Love]] remade the song for the [[Coca-Cola Zero]] commercial "Everybody Chill", which aired in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.philly.com/2005-06-16/entertainment/25437447_1_coke-zero-coca-cola-zero-katie-bayne |title=G.

*In 2006, the song was used again in a Coca-Cola commercial in the Netherlands, performed by Dutch singer Berget Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berget Lewis, Biografie|url=http://bergetlewismusic.nl/en/about/biografie/|website=Berget Lewis Music|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2010, Coca-Cola once again used the song in a television commercial featuring the entire line of its sponsored [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series|Sprint Cup]] drivers.  The commercial included the drivers singing the song while driving in a race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coke Nascar Harmony Ad|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcnyX73iTY0|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2011, information on how many dollars it would take "to buy the world a Coke" was given in a commercial featuring the red silhouette of a Coke bottle and the melody of the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coca-Cola – I’d Like to Buy the World a Coke (the story of Hilltop)|url=https://thisisnotadvertising.wordpress.com/|website=This is Not Advertising|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2012, As part of the Google Project Rebrief campaign, the Hilltop ad was reimagined for the digital age. Via the web, people were able to "send" a Coke to special vending machines located around the globe. Recipients of the Coke could then record a thank you message to send back to the sender. Machines were located in Buenos Aires; Cape Town; Mountain View, California; and New York City. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google’s ‘Project Re:Brief’: Rethinking web advertising|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/arts-post/post/googles-project-rebrief-rethinking-web-advertising/2012/03/15/gIQAZKpgES_blog.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significance and reception===
In 2007, ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]'' magazine called it "one of the best-loved and most influential ads in TV history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Hamilton, James  |author2=Tylee, John |date=May 18, 2007|title=Ten ads that changed advertising|work=Campaign|page= 20|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/ten-ads-changed-advertising/658586#}}&lt;/ref&gt; It served as a milestone—the first instance of the recording industry's involvement with advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All about ... Advertiser-funded music|work=Campaign|date=February 8, 2008|page= 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketing analysts have noted Coca-Cola's strategy of marrying the idea of happiness and universal love of the product illustrated by the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gieryn, Thomas F. |date=Spring 1987|title=Science and Coca-Cola|work=Science &amp; Technology Studies|volume=5|number=1|pages= 12–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Holbrook, Morris |date=July 1987|title=Mirror, Mirror, on the Wall, What's Unfair in the Reflections on Advertising?|work=[[The Journal of Marketing]]|volume=51|number=3|pages= 95–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commercial has continued receiving accolades in more recent times. In 2000, [[Channel 4 (UK)|Channel 4]] and ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' ranked the song 16th in the [[100 Greatest (UK TV series)|100 Greatest TV Ads]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uktvadverts.com/facts/?list=ch4|website=UK TV Adverts|title=100 Greatest TV Ads|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] ranked the advertisement 10th in their list of the greatest advertisements of all time by in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=thinkbox.TV |url=http://www.thinkbox.tv/server/show/nav.943 |title=Greatest advertisements of all time |date=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305130459/http://thinkbox.tv/server/show/nav.943 |archivedate=2009-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Singles==

===The Hillside Singers===
After the TV commercial aired, radio stations began to get calls from people who liked it. Billy Davis' friends in radio suggested he record the song, but not as an advertising jingle.&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt; It became so popular that the song was rewritten without brand name references and expanded to three verses. Davis recruited a group of studio singers to take it on because The New Seekers did not have time to record it. The studio group named themselves [[The Hillside Singers]] to identify with the ad, and within two weeks the song was on the national charts.  The Hillside Singers' version reached #13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and #5 on Billboard's [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Easy Listening]] chart.  ''Billboard'' ranked this version as the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1972|No. 97 song for 1972]].

===The New Seekers===
The New Seekers later recorded the song&lt;ref name="coke_hilltop"/&gt; and sold 96,000 copies of their record in one day, eventually selling 12 million total. "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)" climbed to UK #1 and US #7 in 1971 and 1972.  The song became a gold record in the U.S., and has also sold over a million copies in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-uks-biggest-selling-singles-of-all-time__21298/|title=The UK's biggest selling singles of all time|last=Myers|first=Justin|date=14 June 2018|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coca-Cola Company waived royalties to the song and instead donated $80,000 in payments to [[UNICEF]].&lt;ref name="coke_hilltop"/&gt; ''Billboard'' ranked this version as the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1972|No. 93 song for 1972]].

'''Juice Rap News''' is an internet based satirical news show, created in [[Melbourne, Australia]] by [[The Juice Media]]. The show was the creation of a duo, Hugo Farrant and Giordano Nanni, based in Australia and consists of a rapped "news report" with [[social commentary]] using comical rap lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hickman |first=Leo |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/nov/26/al-gore-lord-monckton-rap-battle |title=Al Gore and Lord Monckton go head-to-head over climate in spoof video rap battle &amp;#124; Environment |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is known for using [[satire]] and [[rap]] rhyming to analyse important topics of the day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ludlam|first=Scott|title=Senator Ludlam on whistleblowers, democracy, Bradley Manning, Wikileaks, PRISM and Edward Snowden|url=http://scott-ludlam.greensmps.org.au/content/speeches-parliament/senator-ludlam-whistleblowers-democracy-bradley-manning-wikileaks-prism-}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a humorous, yet philosophical fashion. Juice Rap News is distributed via YouTube. Some episodes were licensed to the international television news channel [[RT (TV Network)|RT]] for rebroadcast.&lt;ref name="thejuicemedia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thejuicemedia.com/the-big-news-for-rap-news-in-2014/ |title=The big news for Rap News in 2014 &amp;#124; Juice Rap News |publisher=Thejuicemedia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience of Juice Rap News is international and episodes have been translated into more than 20 languages. 35 episodes were produced in total, plus a video announcing that the 35th episode was the final they would produce. However in September 2016, due to audience demand, Giordano Nanni produced a special episode for that year's [[United States presidential election, 2016|United States presidential election]], and announced that the series would continue to produce content from time to time, with a new crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thejuicemedia.com/hillary-clinton-vs-donald-trump-juice-rap-news-special-edition/|title=Hillary Clinton vs Donald Trump - JUICE RAP NEWS (Special Edition) - The Juice Media|date=2016-09-19|work=The Juice Media|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanni and Farrant co-wrote and produced the series together in their home studio in Melbourne, Australia. Nanni focused on content (crafting the arguments, narrative and perspectives depicted and explored in the show); while Farrant focused on form (giving the dialogue the "rhyme and flow" of rap and performing the vocals of most of the characters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaroots.org/the-minds-behind-rap-news/ |title=MR Original – The Minds Behind Rap News &amp;#124; MEDIA ROOTS – Reporting From Outside Party Lines |publisher=Mediaroots.org |date=2010-11-30 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farrant portrayed the [[News anchor|anchor]] Robert Foster and a host of other characters, including the regulars General Baxter and Terrence Moonseed. Nanni also appeared in the show, portraying many characters, such as Aussie correspondent Ken Oathcarn, "MSMBS" host Brian Washington, PR host Ivan Sakamunev, Bill de Berg and George Torwell, all using vox by Hugo Farrant. The goal was to provide an alternative view on world events, one that they felt was lacking in popular media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xT7Eo_2n0xY |title=Rap News: The juice is loose |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-08-06 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/juice-news-termination-economy-301/ |title=Juice News on RT: Termination of economy — RT News |publisher=Rt.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

Rap News 20 caused controversy when it was released during the [[2013 Australian Federal Election]]. Most of the controversy surrounded Julian Assange's appearance in the episode. The character Ken Oathcarn (played by Nanni) convinces Assange that if he is to be successful in his election bid for a Senate seat, he is in need of a make-over. Assange dons a flannel shirt, a blonde mullet wig and a fake Australian flag tattoo, and proceeds to sing a parody of John Farnham’s "You’re The Voice." The video went viral soon after being posted online. It also featured on [[The Chaser]]'s 2013 Federal Election coverage&lt;ref&gt;The Hamster Decides: Episode 3. 2013. TV broadcast. Australian Broadcasting Commission, 28 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ten's [[The Project (Australian TV program)|The Project]].&lt;ref&gt;The Project. TV broadcast. Ten Network, 26 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The offending scene was filmed in London's Ecuadorian Embassy where Assange has remained since seeking political asylum on 19 June 2012, which he was granted in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Irene Caselli in Quito |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/14/julian-assange-asylum-ecuador-wikileaks |title=Julian Assange will be granted asylum, says official &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Rap News went viral, Assange was publicly chastised for his appearance in the video by Ecuadorian President [[Rafael Correa]], who said,

:"We have sent him a letter: he can campaign politically, but without making fun of Australian politicians. We are not going to allow that. The rules of asylum in principle forbid meddling in the politics of the country that grants asylum. But as a matter of courtesy we are not going to bar Julian Assange from exercising his right to be a candidate. Just so long as he doesn't make fun of Australian politicians or people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-31/ecuador-leader-rebukes-assange-for-mocking-australian-politicia/4926586 |title=Ecuador president Rafael Correa rebukes Julian Assange for mocking Australian politicians - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2013-08-31 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the first public indication of any friction between Assange and his Ecuadorian hosts.

Furthermore, many major media outlets failed to recognise Rap News 20 as satire, calling it a "campaign video," in what Farrant and Nanni described as "true to form."&lt;ref name="blogs.abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/queensland/2013/08/making-over-julian-assange-and-the-media-making-up-the-facts.html?site=goldcoast |title=Making over Julian Assange and the media making up the facts - ABC Queensland - Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) |publisher=Blogs.abc.net.au |date=2013-08-28 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ABC Radio, the duo addressed the controversy and confusion, saying,

:"In the world of the internet parody culture, what we’re doing is accepted and most people and most of the comments on the video and on Twitter and Facebook are overwhelmingly positive. It’s no surprise that once things are taken out of context and brought into the world, of, you know, the considerably more sober world of the mainstream media, these out of context quotes can be portrayed as offensive…We don’t really engage with that audience. Our audience is on the internet. We really pride ourselves on making an internet show and we’re trying to get people away from the more conventional, centralised, one-way media model, such as, basically, the traditional media. We love the fact that people can watch the video, post comments, we reply to comments, it’s a two way dialogue, it’s a totally different culture".&lt;ref name="blogs.abc.net.au"/&gt;

On 14 September 2013, Farrant and Nanni notified viewers that a copyright claim had been filled against the video for the parodic use of Farnham's "You're the Voice", despite protection for parody and satire under Part III: 41A and Part IV: 103AA of the Australian Copyright Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013C00145 |title=Copyright Act 1968 |publisher=Comlaw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October 2013, the duo uploaded a version without the parody, as an agreement with copyright holders had not been reached.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20131120144223/https://www.facebook.com/rapnews/posts/10152314205263452 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with RT network ==

Five episodes from the first season of Rap News were licensed to be distributed by [[RT (TV Network)|RT]] via their website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/shows/juice-news-robert-foster/ |title=Juice News — RT Shows |publisher=Rt.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325100618/http://rt.com/shows/juice-news-robert-foster/ |archivedate=25 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and YouTube channel.

In January 2014 the producers of Rap News confirmed ten episodes from Season 2 would be licensed to RT for broadcast on both RT's television and YouTube channels.&lt;ref name="thejuicemedia1"/&gt;

A brief excerpt about [[Bitcoin]] from Rap News 21 (The News) featured in episode 555 of The Keiser Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q684UxfDSU |title=Keiser Report: MaxCoin (E555) |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-01-28 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; a financial program presented by [[Max Keiser]] and [[Stacy Herbert]] which is broadcast on [[RT America]].

=== Rap News 5 (The War on Journalism) ===
Rap News 5 was 'video of the week' on an edition of Al-Jazeera's ''[[The Listening Post]]'', which aired on 27 November 2010. A heavily edited version of RN5 (lasting just over 60 seconds) played out the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onFUapLAJNI |title=The Midterms Media Players - The Listening Post (Full) |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-11-06 |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rap News 15 (Big Brother is WWWatching You) ===
In a very brief article, Michael Kelly of ''[[Business Insider]]'' wrote about Rap News, saying "This Australian website calls out the immense rise in US domestic surveillance" and went on to describe the Rap News 15 segment as "informative and entertaining".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/this-juice-rap-news-segment-nails-the-terrifying-rise-of-the-us-surveillance-state-2012-9 |title=This Juice Rap News Segment Nails The Terrifying Rise Of The US Surveillance State |publisher=Business Insider |date=2012-09-10 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rap News 15 also came to the attention of American cryptographer and security expert [[Bruce Schneier]], who posted a link to the video on his website, accompanied with text simply stating: "wow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/10/rap_news_on_int.html |title=Schneier on Security: Rap News on Internet Surveillance |publisher=Schneier.com |date=2012-10-30 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rap News 19 (Whistleblower) ===

Australian Senator [[Scott Ludlam]] quoted verbatim a small excerpt from Rap News 19 to conclude a speech he was making in the Australian Senate regarding whistle-blowers. The exact portion he quoted was "Whistleblowers; they leak in the public interest. Now what remains to be known is - is the public interested? If so, this might be a good day to exhibit it! Ignorance is a choice, in the age of the internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn8MIGHR__0 |title=Senator Ludlam on whistleblowers, democracy, Bradley Manning and Edward Snowdon |publisher=YouTube |date=2013-06-19 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rap News 20 (A Game of Polls) ===

See controversies.

=== Rap News 22 (The Energy Crisis) ===

[[Zachary Shahan]] of ''[[TreeHugger]]'' and [[CleanTechnica]] wrote two brief reviews of Rap News 22 in which he claimed to have "really enjoyed it and thought it was quite well done" but went on to say "while they are satirizing conspiracy theorists and global warming deniers, they probably reinforce the myths more than dispel them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Badore |first=Margaret |url=http://www.treehugger.com/fossil-fuels/rap-news-video-presents-our-energy-crises-global-warming-denial-and-our-1-energy-solution.html |title=Rap News video presents our energy crises, global warming denial, Elon Musk on Mars, and our #1 energy solution |publisher=TreeHugger |date=2014-03-13 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Zachary Shahan |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2014/03/13/rap-news-satirizes-conspiracy-theorists-elon-musk-ichard-branson-tony-abbot-peak-oil-proponents |title=Juice Media Satirizes Conspiracy Theorists, Elon Musk, Richard Branson, Tony Abbot, Peak Oil Proponents, &amp; More In "Rap News" Episode 22 |publisher=CleanTechnica |date=2014-03-13 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rap News 23 (Crimea Media Wars) ===

Rap News once again made The Listening Post's 'video of the week', with RN23. A two-minute extract from the Crimea Media Wars video was aired on 5 April edition of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQibkhXXTBA&amp;t=22m29s |title=Listening Post - The state of Egypt's news media |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-04-05 |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karin Knorr Cetina''' (also '''Karin Knorr-Cetina''') (born 19 July 1944 in [[Graz]], [[Austria]]) is an [[Austria]]n [[sociology|sociologist]] well known for her work on [[epistemology]] and [[social constructionism]], summarized in the books ''The Manufacture of Knowledge: An Essay on the Constructivist and Contextual Nature of Science'' (1981) and ''Epistemic Cultures: How the Sciences Make Knowledge'' (1999). Currently, she focuses on the study of [[global microstructures]] and [[Social studies of finance]]. Knorr Cetina is the
Otto Borchert Distinguished Service Professor (Jointly Appointed in Anthropology) and Chair of the Department of Sociology at the [[University of Chicago]].

A ''knowledge object'' is a theoretical concept introduced by Knorr Cetina to describe the emergence of post-social relations in [[epistemic cultures]]. Knowledge objects are different from everyday things and are defined as unfolding structures that are non-identical with themselves; [[Jyri Engeström]] based the concept of [[social objects]] on this concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Engeström|first=Jyri|title=Why some social network services work and others don’t — Or: the case for object-centered sociality|url=http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2005/04/why-some-social-network-services-work-and-others-dont-or-the-case-for-object-centered-sociality.html|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Knorr-Cetina studied at the [[University of Vienna]], receiving a Ph.D. in Cultural Anthropology (with a minor in sociology) in 1971. Her dissertation research focused on the structural analysis of oral literature. She shifted her focus toward sociology as she found that cultural anthropology at the time was too focused on historical concerns, while she was more interested in contemporary social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uvhVALUQbG4C|title=Taking the Naturalistic Turn, Or How Real Philosophy of Science Is Done|last=Bechtel|first=William|last2=Callebaut|first2=Werner|date=1993-12-01|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226091860|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the completion of her doctorate, Knorr-Cetina went to the Institute for Advanced Studies in Vienna, where many influential sociologists were invited to give presentations. This resulted in a Post-doctoral diploma in sociology, and an appointment as an instructor in anthropology at the University of Vienna from 1972–73, and then in sociology from 1973-76. During this time, Knorr-Cetina engaged in her first empirical investigations of science leading the 1975 publication (with Hermann Strasser and Hans Georg Zilian) ''Determinants and Controls of Scientific Development''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gfi_iPJPKnkC|title=Determinants and Controls of Scientific Development|last=Knorr|first=K. D.|last2=Strasser|first2=H.|last3=Zilian|first3=H. G.|date=1975-12-31|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9789027706003|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during these years that she first encountered the work of the ethnomethodologically-inclined sociologist [[Aaron Cicourel]], specifically "Method and measurement in sociology."

From 1976-77, Knorr-Cetina received a [[Ford Foundation]] Fellowship to study at the Institute for the Study of Social Change at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Shortly before her arrival in California, the French philosopher-turned-sociologist [[Bruno Latour]] and British sociologist [[Steve Woolgar|Steven Woolgar]] began their well known "laboratory studies" at the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies|Salk Institute]] in southern California. Korr-Cetina's work at Berkeley ultimately contributed to this network of laboratory studies in the late 1970s, which would eventually become the field of the [[Social Studies of Science and Technology]]. The empirical research conducted while at Berkeley also became her widely-cited 1981 publication ''The Manufacture of Knowledge: An Essay on the Constructivist and Contextual Nature of Science''. Knorr-Cetina also received her Habilitation in sociology at the [[University of Bielefeld]] in 1981, and served as Professor of Sociology at Bielefeld from 1983 to 2001. Her work in the social studies of science during these years culminated in her widely-cited book ''Epistemic Cultures: How the Sciences Make Knowledge,'' published in 1999.

Knorr-Cetina's progression to understanding how technology mediates sociality led her to select global financial markets as a new "laboratory" to study knowledge in society. The first suggestion of this new field site was in the article "Sociality with objects: Social relations in postsocial knowledge societies" (1997), followed later by a conference on "The Status of the Object in Social Science" at Brunel University in September 1999. The paper she presented at this conference, entitled "The Market as an Object of Attachment: Exploring Postsocial Relations in Financial Markets", was later published in 2000. Her co-author was Urs Bruegger, a former foreign exchange dealer. The two collaborated on over a dozen articles on global financial markets.

==Sociology of Global Financial Systems==
With the turn of the century, Knorr Cetina became interested in global financial markets as an object of study. From early work with Urs Bruegger,[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3341821?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents][http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0011392102050003006] we see this developing into a strong research interest.[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1600910X.2003.9672857][https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Xv1pgZA4xH8C&amp;dq=knorr+cetina+financial&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s] This work is enhanced by the application of tools from science studies and the sociology of knowledge, for example, imagining "the market" as an object of attachment for traders or using market infrastructure (e.g. Bloomberg terminals) to see the microconstruction of the global market in the space of the local. The financial market infrastructure also comprises a "global scopic system" that integrates news and information across the world.[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1600910X.2003.9672857]

Knorr Cetina’s lecture “The Synthetic Situation: Interactionism for a Global World” from 2008 is vital in rethinking past assumptions about communication and interaction order previously published by sociologists, namely [[Erving Goffman]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Knorr Cetina, Karin. "[http://ereserves.bowdoin.edu/f12/soc214/knorr_synthetic_soc214.pdf The Synthetic Situation: Interactionism for a Global World]." Lecture. Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction. Boston. 1 Aug. 2008. CBBcat.&lt;/ref&gt; In the lecture, which was eventually published in 2009, Knorr Cetina introduces and explains new concepts regarding global interaction. Although Goffman is widely published and read in these areas, much has changed since his day and Knorr Cetina conceptualized such changes.

The introduction of the “synthetic situation” is arguably one of her most important new concepts. It is defined as a situation that “…invariably includes, and may in fact be entirely constituted by, on-screen projections…”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; A synthetic situation, therefore, can manifest in many ways, both informal and formal. Examples include an online video chat, playing [[video games]] against others on the Internet or even a business deal done via [[Videoconferencing|videoconference]]. This idea can be seen as a result of the advancement in technology in recent years, and adds a new dimension to Goffman’s social situation where [[face-to-face interaction]] is required. Knorr Cetina explains the difference of the two situations by the use of surgery.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; A Goffmanian situation occurs when there is just the surgeon and the patient. A synthetic situation arises, however, when the surgeon uses technology like a scope and a screen in order to accomplish the task at hand. Without looking at the patient through the screen, the job would not be able to be done and would remain a face-to-face, social situation.

Although treasurers were initially responsible for collecting and administering royal revenues, they adopted more and more judiciary functions and turned into the highest judges of the realm. From the 14th&amp;nbsp;century, treasurers presided over the court of appeals for a group of the free royal cities, including [[Buda]], Bártfa, Eperjes, Kassa, Nagyszombat and Pressburg (Pozsony) (today [[Bardejov]], [[Prešov]], [[Košice]], [[Trnava]] and [[Bratislava]] in [[Slovakia]]).

The name is derived from the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] word ''tovor'' ("casket", "strong-box").{{dubious|date=August 2012}}

==Middle Ages==
Initially, the treasurer (taverník) was the administrator of the royal [[treasury]] (i.e. the financial manager of the [[Curia Regia|royal Court]] (''curia regis'')) in the [[History of Hungary|early Hungarian state]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In the 12th and 13th century, besides the curia regis, he became also responsible for the remaining properties of the king. When the royal properties were considerably reduced under King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] (1205-1235; see [[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)]] for details), the treasurer also became responsible for all royal income from royal [[régale]]s ([[Currency|coinage]], exchange of coins, [[precious metals]] management, mining [[monopoly]], salt monopoly, [[customs duty]]), from the taxes of royal towns etc.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Under King [[Charles Robert]] (1308–1342) he became a kind of combined finance minister and minister of economy.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In 1385, the actual treasurer function, i.e. administrator of the royal treasury, became the responsibility of a separate person, who was the treasurer (magister tavernicorum)'s deputy first, and later a [[Royal treasurer (Kingdom of Hungary)|separate royal officer]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The observance of rights and duties of royal towns was also the responsibility of the treasurer. Since the importance of these towns increased in the 14th and 15th century, the treasurer's importance increased as well. He became also the judge charged with appeals from major [[free royal town]]s (tavernical courts). Around 1400, the list of these towns was not stabilized yet, but from the first half of the 15th century, these towns stabilised  ([[Buda]], Kassa ([[Košice]]), [[Pressburg]] (Pozsony, [[Bratislava]]), Nagyszombat ([[Trnava]]), Eperjes ([[Prešov]]), [[Sopron]] and Bártfa ([[Bardejov]])) and were called "tavernical towns". In the course of the 15th century, these tavernical courts became the only courts of the tavernical towns. By the late 15th century, the associate judges of these courts were representatives of the tavernical towns only (and no additional nobles as was the case earlier). The law applied in these courts was a special "tavernical law" (''ius tavernicale''), the first collection of which arose in 1412-18 (''Vetusta iura civitatum sive iura civilia''). It was used as special law system until the 18th century.

The treasurer was also a member of the [[Royal Chamber]] and later also of the [[Vice-regency council]] (see [[palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|palatine]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Modern times==
After the creation of the [[Hungarian Chamber]] (the supreme financial and economic authority of the Kingdom of Hungary between 1528 and 1848), the influence of the treasurer further decreased, because this authority took over many of his tasks.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The function (including the tavernical courts) was abolished ''[[de facto]]'' in 1848; the treasurer's function, however, continued to exist formally till 1918 as the fourth highest royal dignitary, who was member of the Upper Chamber of the [[Diet of Hungary|parliament of the Kingdom of Hungary]] and played a certain role in the [[coronation]] of the king.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The '''Ministry of National Defense''' of Ethiopia is a cabinet-level office in charge of defense related matters of the [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]]. It oversees the [[Ethiopian National Defense Force]] and [[Defense Industry Sector (Ethiopia)|Ethiopian Defense Industry]]. The current minister is Aisha Mohammed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=House approves new cabinet |url=https://fanabc.com/english/2018/10/house-to-approve-draft-law-new-cabinet/ |website=Fanabc |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This institution can trace its origins back to the Ministry of War, which Emperor [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik II]] established in 1907, and made ''[[Fitawrari]]'' [[Habte Giyorgis]] Minister over it.&lt;ref&gt;Bahru Zewde, ''A History of Modern Ethiopia'', second edition (London: James Currey, 2001), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] re-established the Ministry of War in 1942, making ''[[Ras (title)|Ras]]'' [[Abebe Aregai]] its Minister.&lt;ref&gt;Margary Perham, ''The Government of Ethiopia'', second edition (London: Faber and Faber, 1969), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry is headed by a civilian minister which is a requirement of Article 87 of the [[1995 Constitution of Ethiopia|current constitution of Ethiopia]]. It was established 23 August 1995 with the passing of Proclamation 4/1995, which also established the other 14 Ministries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethiopar.net/type/English/hopre/bills/2004_2005/Proc%20No.%204-1995%20Definition%20of%20Powers%20and%20Duties%20of%20the%20Exec.pdf Text of the proclamation]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (accessed 13 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Health Service Lottery''' was a failed [[lottery]] scheme designed to provide funding for the [[National Health Service]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Currie&gt;[[Edwina Currie]] speaking on the National Health Service Lottery, HC Deb 28 July 1988 vol 138 cc744-56 744 745 5.28 am, [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1988/jul/28/national-health-service-lottery#S6CV0138P0_19880728_HOC_684 Hansard]&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme progressed as far as a trial in May 1988, but the draw was cancelled at the last minute on legal grounds, and the 43,000 people who took part had their money refunded.&lt;ref name=ITN/&gt;

==Background==
The lottery, which was a national equivalent of earlier localised lotteries in support of hospital services, had a jackpot of £200,000, and even progressed as far as the issuing of tickets and a prize draw in May 1988.&lt;ref name=ITN/&gt; The scheme was approved by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] in April 1988, and it was estimated that a single draw could have raised up to £500,000 for the NHS.&lt;ref name=ITN&gt;Peter Sharp (journalist), report on [[ITN]] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA1S3NS5VhY&amp;feature=related News at Ten], May 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation==
Although the National Health Lottery scheme was based upon earlier localised lotteries designed to generate funds for health services, by becoming national in scope, the scheme contravened the [[Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976]].&lt;ref name=Currie/&gt; The scheme was referred to the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] by the [[Gaming Control Board|Gaming Board of Great Britain]] on 16 May 1988, halting the lottery before the first winner could be announced.&lt;ref name=ATTGEN&gt;Written Answers (Commons) HC Debate 7 June 1988 vol 134 c447W, [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1988/jun/07/nhs-lottery#S6CV0134P0_19880607_CWA_109 Hansard]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]], Sir [[Patrick Mayhew]] reported in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in July 1988 that letters were written on 23 and 24 May to the company responsible for running the lottery indicating that the director would request police inquiries if the lottery draw took place.&lt;ref name=ATTGEN/&gt;

The issue later appeared at [[Prime Minister's Questions]] on 27 October 1988:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Greville Janner, Baron Janner of Braunstone|Mr. Janner]]: "Does the Prime Minister recall recently endorsing a lottery intended to benefit the grossly under-resourced National Health Service and then having to remove her endorsement when the lottery turned out to be illegal? Is she proposing to endorse a further lottery launched today for the same purpose, which appears to be illegal under both current and intended legislation?"
&lt;br&gt;
[[Margaret Thatcher]]: If something is illegal, one cannot possibly endorse it...On that particular private sector lottery, the advice was that as far as could be seen it was legal. When the advice came that it was illegal, of course one did not endorse it. I have not the slightest intention of having a national lottery organised by the Government. I disapprove of them.&lt;ref&gt;Prime Minister's Questions, HC Deb 27 October 1988 vol 139 cc450-4, [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1988/oct/27/engagements#S6CV0139P0_19881027_HOC_165 Hansard]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Repercussions==
Despite the failure of the scheme, the idea for a national lottery in aid of the health service was not dropped and was extensively debated during Parliamentary Questions on 28 July 1988, and on later occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary questions, HC Deb 28 July 1988 vol 138 cc744-56 [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1988/jul/28/national-health-service-lottery#1988-07-28T05:28:00Z Hansard]&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted in a 1989 issue of ''[[Health Affairs]]'' that surveys showed the most popular approach to raising funds for the NHS was "not an increase in progressive income taxes, but rather the launching of a new national lottery (65 percent)".&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Blendon and Karen Donelan, "[http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/reprint/8/4/52.pdf British Public Opinion on National Health Service Reform]" in ''[[Health Affairs]]'', Vol. 56, Winter 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a "national lottery" in aid of good causes eventually materialised in the form of the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]], first launched in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.co.uk/pdf/lotterysupp2004.pdf "Ten years of the Lottery"], ''[[New Statesman]]'' special supplement, 8 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Languages Committee''' was established in 1928 by the [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|Ministry of Education]] of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]] with the purpose of standardizing and popularizing the usage of [[Standard Chinese]] (also called Mandarin) in the Republic of China. The Committee was known in English as the '''Mandarin Promotion Council''' or the '''National Languages Promotion Committee''' until 2003, but the Chinese name has not changed. The phrase ''Guoyu'' (國語 "National language") typically refers to Standard Chinese, but could also be interpreted as referring to "national languages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tsao |first=Feng-fu |year=2008 |chapter=Chapter 6: The Language Planning Situation in Taiwan: An Update |editor1-last=Kaplan |editor1-first=Robert B. |editor2-last=Baldauf |editor2-first=Richard B. |location=Bristol, UK |title=Language Planning and Policy in Asia: Japan, Nepal, Taiwan and Chinese Characters |volume=1 |publisher=Multilingual Matters |page=286 |isbn=9781847690951 |oclc=214322775}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reorganization of the Executive Yuan  made the duties of the National Languages Committee be transferred to the Department of Lifelong Education's fourth sector (Reading and Language Education) from 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=李婉慈|title=國語推行委員會承辦的本國語文業務，改由業務換由「終身教育司」的「第四科閱讀及語文教育科」承辦|url=http://laes.ntcu.edu.tw/LastNews/NewMore.aspx?sid=3&amp;bid=1045|website=教育部國民小學師資培用聯盟學習領域平台|publisher=National Taichung University of Education|accessdate=28 November 2014|language=Chinese|date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was created as the Preparatory Commission for the Unification of the National Language by the Republic (then still based in [[Nanjing]]) on 21 April 1919. On 12 December 1928, the Commission was renamed to the Preparatory Committee for the Unification of the National Language, headed by [[Woo Tsin-hang]] and had 31 members. The Committee was revived in 1983 as the Mandarin Promotion Council based on [[Taiwan]].

The decisions reached by the Council include:
* Changing the first- and second-grade textbook titles from ''Guowen'' (國文 "National Script") to ''Guoyu'' (國語 "National language"), on 24 January 1920
* Publishing the ''Guoyin Zidian'' (國音字典 "National Pronunciation Dictionary") edited by [[Woo Tsin-hang]], on 24 December 1920. The ''Guoyin Zidian'' later became the ''Mandarin Chinese Dictionary'' ({{zh|t=國語辭典|p=Guóyǔ Cídiǎn|labels=no}}), a comprehensive online&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dict.revised.moe.edu.tw/ |title=教育部重編國語辭典修訂本 |year=1994 |publisher=中華民國教育部 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and CD-ROM [[Traditional Chinese]] Mandarin dictionary.

The Committee for National Language Romanization (羅馬字母拼音研究委員會) under the Council selects and modifies [[Romanization]] Systems. The official Mandarin romanization systems in the [[Republic of China]] have been:
* [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]] (1928–1984)
* [[Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II]] (1984–2002)
* [[Tongyong Pinyin]] (2002–2008)
* [[Hanyu Pinyin]] (starting on 1 January 2009)

Since the [[Taiwanization]] movement took hold in government, the Committee also handles:
* Researching [[mainland China]] Mandarin
* Researching the [[Formosan languages]]
* Researching other varieties of Chinese or languages like [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Taiwanese Hokkien]]

The fonts and all of their subsequently developed versions are released by the [[Software Industry Promotion Agency (Public Organisation)]], or SIPA, together with the [[Department of Intellectual Property]] through [[f0nt.com]], and can be downloaded freely on the website.&lt;ref name = "f0nt-01"/&gt;

The competition was organised by [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]]'s [[Abhisit cabinet|Council of Ministers]], with a view to replacing all existing fonts the Thai Government bought from private sector, including [[Microsoft]]'s "Angsana New", "Browallia New", "Cordia New" and "EucrosiaUPC" which were extensively used at that time, with the fonts created by Thai nationals. The competition was part of the project proposed by the [[Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (Thailand)|Ministry of Information and Communication Technology]], called the "Standard Fonts for Thai Public Sectors" Project (โครงการฟอนต์มาตรฐานราชการไทย). The Ministry was quoted as saying: "...Various fonts are now used among the public agencies, that's why the state papers have never become standard. The fonts are also from the private companies which monopolise the rights over them, so we cannot use them as much as we should...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f0nt.com/news/hooray-for-thai-fonts/ |title=สั่งราชการโละฟอนต์ต่างชาติ ใช้ฟอนต์ไทยแลนด์ |accessdate=2011-05-02 |author=ฟ๐นต์.คอม |date=2010-09-08 |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 September 2010, the Council of Ministers officially announced the thirteen fonts as the public fonts, naming them the "national fonts". The public agencies were ordered to use these fonts, especially "TH Sarabun PSK", in their state papers. They were required to cease to use the private sector's fonts by 5 December 2010, [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]]'s 83rd birthday anniversary. The legislative branch and the judicial branch were also asked for cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thainews.prd.go.th/previewnews.php?tb=NEWS&amp;m_newsid=255309070180 |title=ครม.เห็นชอบให้ทุกหน่วยงานภาครัฐ ดำเนินการติดตั้งฟอนต์สารบรรณเพิ่ม|accessdate=2011-05-02 |author=กรมประชาสัมพันธ์ |date=2010-09-07 |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The font "TH Sarabun PSK" is used in the [[Royal Thai Government Gazette|Government Gazette of Thailand]] on and from January, 2011, replacing "Angsana New". The Gazette's first volume using such font is volume 128, part 1 A, dated January 7, 2011, in which the "Ministerial Regulation Determining the Criteria and Procedure for Acknowledging the Aircraft Type Certificates or Supplementary Type Certificates issues by the State Parties to the Conventions governing the Application for Certificates of Airworthiness or by the States with which Thailand has adopted the similar Agreements, BE 2553 (2010)" ("กฎกระทรวงกำหนดหลักเกณฑ์และวิธีการรับรองใบรับรองแบบอากาศยานหรือใบรับรองแบบส่วนเพิ่มเติมที่ออกโดยรัฐภาคีแห่งอนุสัญญาหรือประเทศที่ได้ทำความตกลงกับประเทศไทย เพื่อขอใบสำคัญสมควรเดินอากาศ พ.ศ. 2553") was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2554/A/001/1.PDF |title=กฎกระทรวงกำหนดหลักเกณฑ์และวิธีการรับรองใบรับรองแบบอากาศยานหรือใบรับรองแบบส่วนเพิ่มเติมที่ออกโดยรัฐภาคีแห่งอนุสัญญาหรือประเทศที่ได้ทำความตกลงกับประเทศไทย เพื่อขอใบสำคัญสมควรเดินอากาศ พ.ศ. 2553|accessdate=2011-05-02 |author=ราชกิจจานุเบกษา |date=2011-01-07 |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The font "TH Sarabun PSK" is also used on the current logo of [[Thai Wikipedia]]. This version of the logo was designed by Pratya Singto (ปรัชญา สิงห์โต), a [[graphic designer]] who runs f0nt.com, and was adopted by the Community as it won a [[:th:วิกิพีเดีย:โครงการออกแบบโลโก้วิกิพีเดียไทย|competition in 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f0nt.com/forum/index.php/topic,13186.0.html |title=กระจู๋: อันว่าด้วยโลโก้วิกิพีเดียไทย |accessdate=2011-05-02 |author=ฟ๐นต์.คอม |date=2008-06-05 |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{More references|date=October 2015}}

The term "'''need to know'''", when used by [[government]] and other organizations (particularly those related to the [[military]] or [[espionage]]), describes the restriction of data which is considered very sensitive. Under need-to-know restrictions, even if one has all the necessary official approvals (such as a [[security clearance]]) to access certain information, one would not be given access to such information, or [[read into]] a [[clandestine operation]], unless one has a specific ''need to know''; that is, access to the information must be necessary for one to conduct one's official duties. This term also includes anyone that the people with the knowledge deem necessary to share it with.

As with most security mechanisms, the aim is to make it difficult for unauthorized access to occur, without inconveniencing legitimate access. Need-to-know also aims to discourage "[[browsing]]" of sensitive material by limiting access to the smallest possible number of people.

==Examples==
The [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]] in 1944 is an example of a need-to-know restriction. Though thousands of military personnel were involved in planning the invasion, only a small number of them knew the entire scope of the operation; the rest were only informed of data needed to complete a small part of the plan.  The same is true of the [[Trinity (nuclear_test)|Trinity project]], the first test of a nuclear weapon in 1945.

==Problems and criticism==
Like other security measures, need to know can be misused by persons who wish to refuse others access to information they hold in an attempt to increase their personal power, prevent unwelcome review of their work, prevent embarrassment resulting from actions or thoughts. 

Need to know can also be invoked to hide extra-legal activities. This may be considered a necessary use, or a detrimental abuse of such a policy when considered from different perspectives.

Need to know can be detrimental to workers' efficiency. The speed of computations with IBM [[mechanical calculator|mechanical calculators]] at [[Project Y|Los Alamos]] dramatically increased after the calculators' operators were told what the numbers meant:

What they had to do was work on IBM machines - punching holes, numbers that they didn't understand. Nobody told them what it was. The thing was going very slowly. I said that the first thing there has to be is that these technical guys know what we're doing. [[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] went and talked to the security and got special permission so I could give a nice lecture about what we were doing, and they were all excited: "We're fighting a war! We see what it is!" They knew what the numbers meant. If the pressure came out higher, that meant there was more energy released, and so on and so on. They knew what they were doing.

Complete transformation! They began to invent ways of doing it better. They improved the scheme. They worked at night. They didn't need supervising in the night; they didn't need anything. They understood everything; they invented several of the programs that we used.|sign=[[Richard Feynman]]|source=''[[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!]]''}}

==In computer technology==
The [[discretionary access control]] mechanisms of some [[operating system]]s can be used to enforce need to know. In this case, the owner of a file determines whether another person should have access. Need to know is often concurrently applied with [[mandatory access control]] schemes, in which the lack of an official approval (such as a clearance) may absolutely prohibit a person from accessing the information. This is because need to know can be a subjective assessment. Mandatory access control schemes can also audit accesses, in order to determine if need to know has been violated.

The term is also used in the concept of [[graphical user interface]] design where computers are controlling complex equipment such as airplanes. In this usage, when many different pieces of data are dynamically competing for finite [[user interface]] space, safety-related messages are given priority.

[[Image:OODA.Boyd.svg|thumb|500px|Diagram of the OODA loop]]

The '''OODA loop''' is the cycle, ''observe, orient, decide, and act'', developed by [[military strategy|military strategist]] and [[United States Air Force]] Colonel [[John Boyd (military strategist)|John Boyd]]. Boyd applied the concept to the [[combat operations process]], often at the operational level during military campaigns.  It is now also often applied to understand commercial operations and learning processes.  The approach explains how agility can overcome raw power in dealing with human opponents.

==Overview==
The OODA loop has become an important concept in [[litigation strategy|litigation]],&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. Dreier pp. 20–85&lt;/ref&gt; business,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. Richards pp. 162–171&lt;/ref&gt; [[law enforcement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Papenfuhs|first1=Steve (Pappy)|title=The OODA loop, reaction time, and decision making|url=http://www.policeone.com/use-of-force/articles/5097938-The-OODA-loop-reaction-time-and-decision-making/|publisher=PoliceOne.com|accessdate=3 November 2016|archivedate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[military strategy]]. According to Boyd, [[decision-making]] occurs in a recurring cycle of observe-orient-decide-act. An entity (whether an individual or an organization) that can process this cycle quickly, observing and reacting to unfolding events more rapidly than an opponent can thereby "get inside" the opponent's decision cycle and gain the advantage. Frans Osinga has argued that Boyd's own views on the OODA loop are much deeper, richer, and more comprehensive than the common interpretation of the "rapid OODA loop" idea.&lt;ref name="Osinga1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Osinga |first=Frans |url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL8101451W/Science_Strategy_and_War |title=Science Strategy and War, The Strategic Theory of John Boyd |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, UK |isbn=0-415-37103-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyd developed the concept to explain how to direct one's energies to defeat an adversary and survive. Boyd emphasized that "the loop" is actually a set of interacting loops that are to be kept in continuous operation during combat. He also indicated that the phase of the battle has an important bearing on the ideal allocation of one's energies.

Boyd's diagram shows that all decisions are based on observations of the evolving situation tempered with implicit filtering of the problem being addressed. The observations are the raw information on which decisions and actions are based. The observed information must be processed to orient it for decision making. In notes from his talk "Organic Design for Command and Control", Boyd said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The second O, orientation—as the repository of our [[genetic heritage]], cultural tradition, and previous experiences—is the most important part of the O-O-D-A loop since it shapes the way we observe, the way we decide, the way we act.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As stated by Boyd and shown in the "Orient" box, there is much filtering of the information through our culture, genetics, ability to analyze and synthesize, and previous experience. Since the OODA Loop was designed to describe a single decision maker, the situation is usually much more complex than shown, as most business and technical decisions have a team of people observing and orienting, each bringing their own cultural traditions, genetics, experience and other information. It is here that decisions often get stuck, which does not lead to winning, because:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to win, we should operate at a faster tempo or rhythm than our adversaries—or, better yet, get inside [the] adversary's Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action time cycle or loop&amp;nbsp;... Such activity will make us appear ambiguous (unpredictable) thereby generate confusion and disorder among our adversaries—since our adversaries will be unable to generate mental images or pictures that agree with the menacing, as well as faster transient rhythm or patterns, they are competing against.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The OODA loop, which focuses on strategic military requirements, was adapted for business and public sector operational continuity planning. Compare it to the [[PDCA|Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) cycle]] or [[Walter A. Shewhart|Shewhart cycle]].

As one of Boyd's colleagues, Harry Hillaker, put it in "John Boyd, [[United States Air Force|USAF]] Retired, Father of the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F16]]":
&lt;blockquote&gt;The key is to obscure your intentions and make them unpredictable to your opponent while you simultaneously clarify his intentions. That is, operate at a faster tempo to generate rapidly changing conditions that inhibit your opponent from adapting or reacting to those changes and that suppress or destroy his awareness. Thus, a hodgepodge of confusion and disorder occur to cause him to over- or under-react to conditions or activities that appear to be uncertain, ambiguous, or incomprehensible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The OODA Loop also serves to explain the nature of surprise and shaping operations in a way that unifies [[Gestalt psychology]], [[cognitive science]] and [[game theory]] in a comprehensive theory of strategy. [[Utility|Utility theory]] (the basis of game theory) describes how decisions are made based on the perceived value of taking an action. The OODA Loop shows that prior to making a decision (the Decide phase), the person will first have to get information (Observe) and determine what it means to him and what he can do about it (Orient). In this way, the utility sought at the Decide phase can be altered by affecting the information the opponent receives and the [[cognitive model]] he applies when orienting upon it.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. Dreier pp. 79–85&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Robert Greene (American author)|Robert Greene]] wrote in an article called ''OODA and You'' that &lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;the proper mindset is to let go a little, to allow some of the chaos to become part of his mental system, and to use it to his advantage by simply creating more chaos and confusion for the opponent. He funnels the inevitable chaos of the battlefield in the direction of the enemy.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Applicability==
{{unsourced section|date=March 2018}}
{{original research section|date=March 2018}}
Consider a [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] pilot being scrambled to shoot down an enemy aircraft.

Before the enemy airplane is even within visual range, the pilot will consider any available information about the likely identity of the enemy pilot—the nationality, level of training, and cultural traditions that may come into play.

When the enemy aircraft comes into radar contact, more direct information about the speed, size, and maneuverability of the enemy plane becomes available; unfolding circumstances take priority over radio chatter. A first decision is made based on the available information so far: The pilot '''decides''' to "get into the sun" above his opponent, and '''acts''' by applying control inputs to climb. Back to '''observation'''—is the attacker reacting to the change of altitude? Then comes '''orient''': Is the enemy reacting characteristically, or perhaps acting like a noncombatant? Is his plane exhibiting better-than-expected performance?

As the [[dogfight]] begins, little time is devoted to orienting unless some new information pertaining to the actual identity or intent of the attacker comes into play. Information cascades in real time, and the pilot does not have time to process it consciously; the pilot reacts as he is trained to, and conscious thought is directed to supervising the flow of action and reaction, continuously repeating the OODA cycle. Simultaneously, the opponent is going through the same cycle.

One of John Boyd's primary insights in fighter combat was that it is vital to change speed and direction faster than the opponent. This may interfere with an opponent's OODA cycle. It is not necessarily a function of the plane's ability to maneuver, but the pilot must think and act faster than the opponent can think and act. Getting "inside" the cycle, short-circuiting the opponent's thinking processes, produces opportunities for the opponent to react inappropriately.

Another tactical-level example can be found on the basketball court, where a player takes possession of the ball and must get past an opponent who is taller or faster. A straight [[dribbling|dribble]] or pass is unlikely to succeed. Instead, the player may engage in a rapid and elaborate series of body movements designed to befuddle the opponent and deny him the ability to take advantage of his superior size or speed. At a basic level of play, this may be merely a series of fakes, with the hope that the opponent will make a mistake or an opening will occur, but practice and mental focus may allow one to accelerate tempo, get inside the opponent's OODA loop, and take control of the situation, causing the opponent to move in a particular way and generating an advantage rather than merely reacting to an accident. Taking control of the situation is key. It is not enough to speed through OODA faster, which results in flailing.

The same cycle operates over a longer timescale in a competitive business landscape, and the same [[logic]] applies. Decision makers gather information (observe), form hypotheses about customer activity and the intentions of competitors (orient), make decisions, and act on them. The cycle is repeated continuously. The aggressive and conscious application of the process gives a business advantage over a competitor who is merely reacting to conditions as they occur or has poor awareness of the situation. Especially in business, in which teams of people are working the OODA Loop, it often gets stuck at the "D" (see Ullman) and no action is taken allowing the competition to gain the upper hand or resources to be wasted.

The approach favors agility over raw power in dealing with human opponents in any endeavor. Boyd put the ethos into practice with his work for the United States Air Force. He was an advocate of maneuverable fighter aircraft, in contrast to the heavy, powerful jet fighters (such as the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]]) that were prevalent in the 1960s. Boyd inspired the [[Lightweight Fighter program]] (LWF) that produced the successful [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]] and [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]], which are still in use by the United States and several other military powers into the 21st century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2224">'''One Jerusalem''' is an organisation with the stated mission of "maintaining a united [[Jerusalem]] as the undivided capital of [[Israel]]". It was founded as a response to the [[Oslo accords|Oslo Peace Process]], specifically, out of a concern that the settlement might lead to Palestinian [[sovereignty]] over Jerusalem's [[Temple Mount]] or [[Noble Sanctuary]].

Chaired by former Deputy Prime Minister [[Natan Sharansky]], the organisation is entirely publicly funded. One Jerusalem's website describes its activities as follows: ''"One Jerusalem organizes, educates and rallies supporters in Israel and all democratic countries, so that we can educate elected government officials ..."''. 

An inaugural rally organised by One Jerusalem in January 2001 to protest the proposal of Palestinian sovereignty over the Temple Mount attracted a crowd variously described as thousands ([http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/meast/01/08/mideast.04/ CNN Report 2001-01-08]), 100,000 (Israeli TV reports via [http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/meast/01/08/mideast.04/ CNN]) and 400,000 ([http://www.onejerusalem.org/ One Jerusalem]).

One Jerusalem has over 100,000 members from across the globe.

== Origins ==

The philosophical roots of participatory rural appraisal techniques can be traced to activist adult education methods such as those of [[Paulo Freire]] and the study clubs of the [[Antigonish Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Flower |first1=Charlotte |last2=Mincher |first2=Paul |last3=Rimkus |first3=Susan |date=2000 |title=Overview—participatory processes in the North |journal=PLA Notes |volume=38 |pages=14–18 |url=http://pubs.iied.org/G01883/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, an actively involved and empowered local population is essential to successful rural community development. [[Robert Chambers (development scholar)|Robert Chambers]], a key exponent of PRA, argued that the approach owes much to "the Freirian theme, that poor and exploited people can and should be enabled to analyze their own reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chambers |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Chambers (development scholar) |date=1997 |title=Whose reality counts?: putting the first last |location=London |publisher=[[Intermediate Technology Development Group|Intermediate Technology Publications]] |isbn=185339386X |oclc=36589868 |page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1980s, there was growing dissatisfaction among development experts with both the reductionism of formal surveys, and the biases of typical field visits. In 1983, Robert Chambers, a Fellow at the [[Institute of Development Studies]] (UK), used the term ''rapid rural appraisal'' (RRA) to describe techniques that could bring about a "reversal of learning", to learn from rural people directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chambers |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Chambers (development scholar) |date=April 1981 |title=Rapid rural appraisal: rationale and repertoire |journal=Public Administration and Development |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=95–106 |doi=10.1002/pad.4230010202 |url=http://www.parkdatabase.org/documents/download/1981_chambers_rapid_rural_appraisal_rationale_and_repertoire_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chambers |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Chambers (development scholar) |date=1984 |origyear=1983 |title=Rural development: putting the last first |location=London; New York |publisher=[[Longman]] |isbn=0582644437 |oclc=9196254 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLeOAwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the first international conference to share experiences relating to RRA was held in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Proceedings of the 1985 International Conference on Rapid Rural Appraisal: Khon Kaen University |date=1987 |location=Khon Kaen, Thailand |publisher=Published by Rural Systems Research Project and Farming Systems Research Project for [[Khon Kaen University]] |isbn=9789745552517 |oclc=19025969}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a rapid acceptance of usage of methods that involved rural people in examining their own problems, setting their own goals, and monitoring their own achievements. By the mid 1990s, the term RRA had been replaced by a number of other terms including ''participatory rural appraisal'' (PRA) and ''participatory learning and action'' (PLA).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=participatory+rural+appraisal%2Cparticipatory+learning+and+action&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1980&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3 Search results for 'participatory rural appraisal' and 'participatory learning and action'] on [[Google Ngram Viewer]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Chambers acknowledged that the significant breakthroughs and innovations that informed the methodology came from community development practitioners in Africa, India and elsewhere. Chambers helped PRA gain acceptance among practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singh |first=Kamal |date=2001 |chapter=Handing over the stick: the global spread of participatory approaches to development |editor1-last=Edwards |editor1-first=Michael |editor2-last=Gaventa |editor2-first=John |title=Global citizen action |location=Boulder, Colorado |publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] |pages=175–187 |isbn=1555879683 |oclc=45879585 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=bshQAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chambers explained the function of participatory research in PRA as follows:

{{quote |text=The central thrusts of the [new] paradigm … are decentralization and empowerment. Decentralization means that resources and discretion are devolved, turning back the inward and upward flows of resources and people. Empowerment means that people, especially poorer people, are enabled to take more control over their lives, and secure a better livelihood with ownership and control of productive assets as one key element. Decentralization and empowerment enable local people to exploit the diverse complexities of their own conditions, and to adapt to rapid change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chambers |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Chambers (development scholar) |date=1993 |title=Challenging the professions: frontiers for rural development |location=London |publisher=[[Intermediate Technology Development Group|Intermediate Technology Publications]] |isbn=1853391948 |oclc=28470414}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Overview of techniques ==
Over the years techniques and tools have been described in a variety of books and newsletters, or taught at training courses.&lt;ref name="Chambers origins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pretty Vodouhe"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pretty |first1=Jules N. |last2=Vodouhê |first2=Simplice D. |date=1997 |origyear=1984 |chapter=Using rapid or participatory rural appraisal |editor1-last=Swanson |editor1-first=Burton E. |editor2-last=Bentz |editor2-first=Robert P. |editor3-last=Sofranko |editor3-first=Andrew J. |title=Improving agricultural extension: a reference manual |edition=2nd |location=Rome |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] |isbn=9251040079 |oclc=456586976 |chapterurl=http://www.fao.org/docrep/W5830E/w5830e08.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sontheimer et al"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sontheimer |first1=Sally |last2=Callens |first2=Karel |last3=Seiffert |first3=Bernd |date=1999 |chapter=PRA tool box |title=Conducting a PRA training and modifying PRA tools to your needs: an example from a participatory household food security and nutrition project in Ethiopia |location=Rome |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] |chapterurl=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/X5996E/x5996e06.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the field has been criticized for lacking a systematic evidence-based methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leurs |first=Robert |date=August 1997 |title=Critical reflections on rapid and participatory rural appraisal |journal=Development in Practice |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=290–293 |jstor=4029070 |url=http://www.developmentinpractice.org/journals/critical-reflections-rapid-and-participatory-rural-appraisal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic techniques used include:&lt;ref name="Chambers origins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Castelloe Gamble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Narayanasamy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pretty Vodouhe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sontheimer et al"/&gt;
* Understanding [[group dynamics]], e.g. through learning contracts, [[role reversal]]s, feedback sessions
* Surveying and [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]], e.g. transect walks, wealth ranking, social mapping
* [[Interview (research)|Interviewing]], e.g. [[focus group]] discussions, [[semi-structured interview]]s, [[Triangulation (social science)|triangulation]]
* [[Information visualization|Community mapping]], e.g. [[Venn diagram]]s, [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] scoring, [[Eco-map|ecogram]]s, [[timeline]]s

To ensure that people are not excluded from participation, these techniques avoid [[writing]] wherever possible, relying instead on the tools of [[orality|oral communication]] and [[visual communication]] such as pictures, symbols, physical objects and group memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robinson-Pant |first=Anna |date=1995 |title=PRA: a new literacy? |journal=PLA Notes |volume=24 |pages=78–82 |url=http://pubs.iied.org/G01605/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts are made in many projects, however, to build a bridge to formal [[literacy]]; for example by teaching people how to sign their names or recognize their signatures. Often developing communities are reluctant to permit invasive audio-visual recording.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Developmental changes in PRA ==
Since the early 21st century, some practitioners have replaced PRA with the standardized model of [[community-based participatory research]] (CBPR) or with [[participatory action research]] (PAR).{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} Social survey techniques have also changed during this period, including greater use of [[information technology]] such as [[fuzzy cognitive map]]s, [[e-participation]], [[telepresence]], [[social network analysis]], [[topic model]]s, [[geographic information system]]s (GIS), and [[interactive multimedia]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1470">The '''Periprava labor camp''' was a [[labor camp]] operated by the [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]]. It was located near the village of [[Periprava]] in the [[Danube Delta]].

Periprava was one of the places of detention of Romanian writer [[Florin Pavlovici]], described by him in his memoirs. It first housed political prisoners in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/m-rturii-infernul-periprava Mărturii din infernul de la Periprava ] ("Testimony from the Hell of Periprava")&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Piazza della Loggia bombing''' was a bombing that took place on the morning of 28 May 1974, in [[Brescia]], [[Italy]] during an [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] protest. The terrorist attack killed eight people and wounded 102. The bomb was placed inside a [[rubbish bin]] at the east end of the square. In 2015, a Court of appeal in [[Milan]] issued a final life sentence to ''[[Ordine Nuovo]]'' members Carlo Maria Maggi and Maurizio Tramonte for ordering the bombing, closing one of the longest-running cases on terrorism during Italy's [[Years of Lead (Italy)|years of lead]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Overview ==
The first judicial investigation led to the condemnation in 1979 of a member of the Brescian [[far-right]] movement, [[Ermanno Buzzi]]. However, this first sentence was cancelled in 1982, but in 1983 the Court of Cassation declared the appeal process must be redone at the Court of appeal in [[Venice]]. The suspects were acquitted in 1985 by the Court of Venice, and in 1987 by the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Supreme Court of Cassation]]. Buzzi, killed in [[Novara]]'s prison by neo-fascists [[Pierluigi Concutelli]] and [[Mario Tuti]] in 1981, was judged "a corpse to be carried out".&lt;br/&gt;
A second investigation led to the accusation of another far-right activists; [[Cesare Ferri]], [[Sergio Latini]] and [[Alessandro Stepanoff]]. They were acquitted for lack of evidence in 1987; in 1989 Ferri and Latini were acquitted for not having committed the crime, Stepanoff for lack of evidence.&lt;br/&gt;
A third investigation led to a trial for [[Francesco Delfino]] (a Carabiniere), [[Carlo Maria Maggi (politician)|Carlo Maria Maggi]], [[Pino Rauti]], [[Maurizio Tramonte]] and [[Delfo Zorzi]] (members of the ''[[Ordine Nuovo]]'' [[neo-fascist]] group). The presence of Tramonte in the place at the time of the blast was confirmed in 2008 by the results of an anthropological forensic test on a picture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/popup/servizi/2008/tramonte/1.html Photo from Repubblica.it from a 2008 publication]&lt;/ref&gt; taken that day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/2008/08/sezioni/cronaca/strage-loggia-foto/strage-loggia-foto/strage-loggia-foto.html "Strage di piazza della Loggia, spunta la foto choc della strage"] ''[[la Repubblica]]''. 30 August 2008 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
On 16 November 2010, the Court of Brescia acquitted the defendants (the prosecutor had requested life imprisonment for Delfino, Maggi, Tramonte and Zorzi, and the acquittal for lack of evidence for Pino Rauti). The four defendants were acquitted also in 2012, but in 2014 the supreme Court of Cassation declared the appeal process must be redone at the Court of appeal in [[Milan]] for Maggi and Tramonte. Delfino and Zorzi are finally acquitted. On 22 July 2015, the Court of appeal sentenced Maggi and Tramonte to life imprisonment for ordering and coordinating the massacre.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Strage di piazza Loggia, ergastolo ai neofascisti Maggi e Tramonte|url = http://brescia.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/15_luglio_22/strage-piazza-loggia-giorno-sentenza-21d95ef0-3062-11e5-8ebc-a14255a4c77f.shtml|accessdate = 2015-07-23|website = Corriere della Sera|language = Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

==2000 report alleging US intelligence involvement==
A 2000 parliamentary report by the [[The Olive Tree (political coalition)|Olive Tree coalition]] claimed "that US intelligence agents were informed in advance about several right-wing terrorist bombings, including the December 1969 [[Piazza Fontana bombing]] in Milan and the Piazza della Loggia bombing in Brescia five years later, but did nothing to alert the Italian authorities or to prevent the attacks from taking place. It also [alleged] that Pino Rauti [current leader of the [[Social Idea Movement]] ], a journalist and founder of the far-right Ordine Nuovo subversive organisation, received regular funding from a press officer at the US embassy in Rome. 'So even before the 'stabilising' plans that Atlantic circles had prepared for Italy became operational through the bombings, one of the leading members of the subversive right was literally in the pay of the American embassy in Rome,' the report says.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/us.terrorism_graun_24jun2000.html US 'supported anti-left terror in Italy'], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 24 June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: the reference fails to cite the name of the press officer in the US embassy.&lt;/ref&gt;

In UK local authority politics, the term '''prejudicial interest''' is used to describe a particular type of [[conflict of interest]] involving councillors. When a councillor has an interest in a topic under debate that may affect their ability to fairly and objectively consider the subject, he or she is said to have a prejudicial interest. An example would be a councillor discussing a planning application for a company in which he or she has an interest. The councillor has an interest in the plans being approved and is therefore considered to have a "prejudicial interest".

The [[Standards Board for England]] is the body responsible for investigating allegations of undeclared prejudicial interests. It is the responsibility of the councillor to declare their interest prior to discussions or votes and, once declared, they must leave the room for the duration of the discussion or vote.

Anyone can make an allegation of an undeclared prejudicial interest although the [[Standards Board for England]] can only investigate reactively rather than proactively - i.e. they cannot intervene to stop an offence from taking place, only investigate the offence once it has taken place.

Councillors and members of other local authorities in England are governed by a Code of Practice which is enforced by the [[Standards Board for England]].  In Scotland, the Standards Commission for Scotland carries out a similar function but also regulates members of devolved bodies.  In Wales, it is the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales that carries out the equivalent function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1751">The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill is a piece of Irish legislation.  

It was first published in 2015 and agreed on by the [[Dáil]] in October 2018.  It is intended to reduce alcohol consumption and the harms caused by the misuse of alcohol. It provides for [[Statutory law|statutory]] [[minimum price]]s on alcohol, restrictions on advertising, stark warning labels on alcohol products, and the separation and reduced visibility of alcohol products in mixed trading outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=After 1,000 days of debate, the government's landmark alcohol legislation has been passed |url=https://www.thejournal.ie/government-alcohol-bill-4267371-Oct2018/ |accessdate=8 November 2018 |publisher=The Journal |date=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minister for Health [[Simon Harris (politician)|Simon Harris]] brought 23 sections of the Bill into operation in November 2018.  Alcohol advertising is to be banned within 200 metres of a school, [[Child care|crèche]], or local authority playground and in or on public service vehicles, at public transport stops or stations from 2019.  From 12 November 2020 alcohol products must be separated by a {{convert|1.2|metre}} high barrier from other goods. From 2021 various measures come into force to ensure that children are protected from alcohol advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alcohol ads to be banned near schools, creches and playgrounds from next year |url=https://www.thejournal.ie/public-health-alcohol-bill-2-4320448-Nov2018/ |accessdate=8 November 2018 |publisher=The Journal |date=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quamina Gladstone''', most often referred to simply as '''Quamina''', was a [[British Guiana|Guianese]] slave, a [[Coromantee]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} who was father of [[Jack Gladstone]]. He and his son were involved in the [[Demerara rebellion of 1823]], one of the largest [[slave revolts]] in the [[Crown colony|British colonies]] before slavery was abolished.

He was a carpenter by trade, and worked on an estate owned by [[Sir John Gladstone, 1st Baronet|Sir John Gladstone]]. Quamina was implicated in the revolt by the colonial authorities, apprehended and executed on 16 September 1823. He is considered a national hero in Guyana, and there are streets in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] and the village of Beterverwagting on the East Coast Demerara, named after him.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;

== Biography ==
Quamina&lt;ref&gt;"Quamina" corresponds to Kwamena, a name of Ghanaian origin denoting a male born on Saturday. See [[Akan names]].&lt;/ref&gt; was a carpenter who lived and worked on the "Success" plantation in [[Demerara]].&lt;ref name=abolproject&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abolition.e2bn.org/resistance_53.html |title=Case Study 3: Demerara (1823) – Quamina and John Smith |accessdate=21 November 2009 |publisher=The Abolition Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stabroek&gt;McGowan, Winston (30 August 2007).

His mother died on a plantation in 1817.&lt;ref name=stabroek/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;da Costa (1994), p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; In some source material, he is surnamed Gladstone, as the enslaved adopted surnames of their masters by convention. [[Sir John Gladstone, 1st Baronet|Sir John Gladstone]], who had never set foot on his plantation, had acquired half share in the plantation in 1812 through mortgage default; he acquired the remaining half four years later.&lt;ref name=Sheridan&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/index.php/nwig/article/view/3455/4216 |format=pdf |first=Richard B. |last=Sheridan |title=The Condition of slaves on the sugar plantations of Sir John Gladstone in the colony of Demerara 1812 to 1849 |journal=[[New West Indian Guide]] |volume=76 |year=2002 |number= 3/4 |pages= 243–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended services at the Bethel Chapel of the [[London Missionary Society]] on neighbouring Le Resouvenir plantation when the chapel opened in 1808.&lt;ref name=stabroek/&gt; Under the guidance of Reverend John Wray,&lt;ref name=guyana/&gt; he learned to read and write.&lt;ref name=dacosta181&gt;da Costa (1994), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guyanacaribbeannetwork.com/ourfeature.08.04.08.htm |title=PART II Blood, sweat, tears and the struggle for basic human rights |publisher=Guyana Caribbean Network |accessdate=21 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; As was witnessed in a letter he wrote to the LMS, he was persuaded to attend the recently opened church by the person who he served as apprentice.&lt;ref name=stabroek/&gt; Wray noticed positive changes after he became Christian.&lt;ref name=dacosta181/&gt; Quamina was proud and hardworking, and was baptised on 26 December 1808.&lt;ref name=stabroek/&gt; On being assessed for fitness to become a member, Quamina declared that when he was young, he had been a houseboy and had to "fetch" girls to entertain the estate's managers.&lt;ref name=dacosta181/&gt; When Wray was sent to nearby [[Berbice]] in 1816,&lt;ref name=guyana&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guyana.org/features/guyanastory/chapter41.html |title=The Anti-Slavery Movement in British Guiana |publisher=Guyana News and Information |accessdate=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; his replacement [[John Smith (missionary)|John Smith]] was equally impressed by Quamina's qualities.&lt;ref name=abolproject/&gt; He took an interest in others, and had become widely respected by slaves and free blacks throughout the colony.&lt;ref name=dacosta181/&gt;&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt; One of five slaves elected [[deacon]] by the congregation in 1817,&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 145"&gt;da Costa (1994), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Quamina became Smith's personal favourite, and was highly trusted by John Smith and his wife, Jane.&lt;ref name=stabroek3&gt;McGowan, Winston (13 September 2007). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2492&amp;dat=20070913&amp;id=IUZaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oSYMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1813,2049664 "The 1823 Demerara slave rebellion (Part 3)"] ''Stabroek News''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 145"/&gt; According to da Costa, he was a "loyal, well-behaved, trustworthy and pious deacon." He brought news of the congregation members on a day-to-day basis, and was always consulted about the affairs of any member.&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt;&lt;ref name="da Costa 1994, pg. 145"/&gt;

Quamina had many wives, but he cohabited for twenty years with Peggy, a [[freedman|free woman]]. As was common with other slaves, he had been harshly treated and humiliated by his masters and once was beaten badly and incapacitated for six weeks. He was frequently forced to work, thus missing religious services.&lt;ref name=dacosta181/&gt; In 1822,&lt;ref name=dacosta181/&gt; when Peggy was taken seriously ill, he was forced to work all day, every day, and was not allowed any time off to look after her. One evening, he returned to find her dead.&lt;ref name="abolproject"/&gt;

== The revolt ==
{{Main|Demerara rebellion of 1823}}
Being very close to Jack, Quamina supported his son's aspirations to be free, by supporting the fight for the rights of slaves. But he was at the same time a rational man.&lt;ref&gt;da Costa (1994), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; He had been troubled for some time by rumours he had heard about an emancipation ordered by Britain that was being withheld by the colonists. Rev. John Smith noted in a private journal entry on 25 July that Quamina had spoken of the matter. Smith assured him that any announcement would be of measures to improve the slaves' condition, and that the rumours of anticipation were not to be believed.&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt; He urged him to tell the other slaves, particularly the Christians, not to rebel&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt; and sent Manuel and Seaton on this mission. When he knew the rebellion was imminent, he urged restraint, and made the fellow slaves promise a peaceful strike.&lt;ref name=guyana43&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guyana.org/features/guyanastory/chapter43.html |title=The Demerara Slave Uprising |publisher=Guyana News and Information |accessdate=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; News of the planned rebellion had leaked out, and Quamina was arrested by John Stewart, the manager at his plantation, shortly before it was due to start. And although he was set loose by fellow slaves as the rebellion was unfolding, Quamina never took up arms, and even actively prevented from Stewart from coming to any harm.&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt; After the slaves' defeat in a major battle at "Bachelor's Adventure", Jack fled into the woods. A "handsome reward"&lt;ref&gt;Bryant (1824), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; of one thousand guilder was offered for the capture of Jack, Quamina and about twenty other "fugitives".&lt;ref&gt;da Costa (1994), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Jack led thousands of slaves in rebellion, most of the colonists thought the reverse – that Quamina was the ultimate leader, and Jack was merely aiding and abetting it.&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt; Jack and his wife were captured by Capt. McTurk at Chateau Margo on 6 September after a three-hour standoff.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant (1824), pp. 83–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Quamina remained at large until he was captured on 16 September in the fields of Chateau Margo. He was executed, and his body was hung up in chains by the side of a public road in front of "Success".&lt;ref name=stabroek3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryant (1824), pp. 87–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The very low number of white deaths is proof that the uprising was largely peaceful – plantation owners, managers and their families were locked up and not harmed.&lt;ref name=GCN/&gt; Hundreds of slaves died during the various battles and skirmishes during the revolt, or were executed as "ringleaders". Jack Gladstone was sold and deported to [[Saint Lucia]]. The rebellion helped bring attention to the plight of sugar plantation slaves, accelerating the full [[abolition of slavery]].&lt;ref name="Sheridan"/&gt;

== Legacy ==

Quamina is considered a national hero in Guyana. In 1985 the post-independence Guyana renamed Murray Street in Georgetown – named for former [[Demerara]] Lieutenant Governor [[John Murray (colonial administrator)|John Murray]] (1813–1824) who was in charge of the colony during the unrest and rebellion – Quamina Street in his honour.&lt;ref name=trust&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.gov.gy/historiccummings.html |title=Historic Cummingsburg |publisher=National Trust of Guyana |accessdate=25 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930064245/http://www.nationaltrust.gov.gy/historiccummings.html |archivedate=30 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A monument to him was erected at the junction of Quamina and Carmichael Streets.&lt;ref name=stabroek/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guyanaobservernews.org/content/view/1447/1/

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1605">The '''Rostock Peace Treaty''' ({{lang-de|Rostocker Landfrieden}}) was a treaty, or ''[[Landfriede]]'', agreed on 13 June 1283 in [[Rostock]] to secure the peace on land and at sea, as well as the protection of taxes and other freedoms. The parties to the treaty agreed that, for ten years, they would avoid the use of force in exercising their rights. This treaty was the foundation for the economic growth of [[Wismar]] and other medieval seaports on the [[Baltic Sea]].

The signatories to the treaty were the [[Hanseatic town]]s of [[Lübeck]], [[Rostock]], [[Wismar]], [[Stralsund]], [[Greifswald]], [[Stettin]], [[Demmin]] and [[Anklam]] as well as the dukes of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Pomerania|Pomerania]], the Prince of [[Principality of Rügen|Rügen]], the lords of [[County of Schwerin|Schwerin]] and [[County of Dannenberg|Dannenberg]] as well as the lesser nobility of Rostock.

The '''Salt Reservations''' (also known as the '''Salt Lands''') were a collection of land tracts surrounding [[salt spring]]s in [[Ohio]] and some other states that were donated to the states by the federal government early in the 19th century.

The [[United States]] had acquired the lands northwest of the [[Ohio River]] at the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] after the [[American Revolutionary War]], and these lands were finally open to settlement.  Leaders knew that in frontier lands such as the [[Ohio Country]], [[salt]] was a precious and scarce commodity, especially for preserving meat in an era before refrigeration.&lt;ref name=officialohio&gt;{{cite book|title=The Official Ohio Lands Book|last=Knepper |first=George W. |year=2002 |publisher= The Auditor of the State of Ohio |page=65 |url=https://ohioauditor.gov/publications/OhioLandsBook.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Americans knew from explorers and Indians of the presence of springs of water containing salt.  So that no one would buy the land upon which salt springs sat, and thus acquire a monopoly of a rare necessity of life, the national government reserved land from public sale on which salt springs were found.&lt;ref name=ohiosub&gt;{{cite book |title=Ohio Lands and Their Subdivision |last=Peters|first=William E.|year=1918 |publisher=W.E. Peters|pages=303–311|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HiApAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA303&amp;lpg=PA303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1796, Congress passed two pieces of legislation to regulate the surveying and sale, or other dispersal, of public lands northwest of the Ohio river, that had not yet been sold or surveyed.  The first of these was the Land Act of May 18, 1796&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|1|464}} - Text of Act of May 18, 1796 [[Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This act called for the land to be surveyed into townships {{convert|6|mi|km}} on a side, arranged in a checkerboard pattern, and further divided into sections of {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} square that will be sold to the public.  Section 3 of this act states "That a salt spring lying upon a creek which empties into the [[Scioto River|Sciota]] river, on the east side, and as many contiguous sections as shall be equal to one township, and every other salt spring which may be discovered, together with the section of one mile square which includes it…shall be reserved, for the future disposal of the United States."  Subsequent surveys identified two additional salt springs near the [[Muskingum River]].

The second relevant congressional action in 1796 was the creation of the [[United States Military District]] in eastern Ohio.  The government did not have adequate funds to pay soldiers during the Revolutionary War.  Instead, they were promised land grants, called bounties, dependent on rank, after the conclusion of the war.  The Act of June 1, 1796&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|1|490}} - Text of Act of June 1, 1796 [[Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt; set aside a district, described how to survey it, and how to distribute the bounties.  Section 1 of this act also reserved tracts, in this act, (squares 2 ½ miles on a side), around any salt springs that might be found.  Subsequent surveys revealed one salt spring in what is now [[Delaware County, Ohio|Delaware county]].

Around the turn of the century, the population of the territory increased to the point that statehood became the next logical step.  On April 30, 1802, the [[Enabling Act of 1802|Ohio Enabling Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|2|173}} - Text of Act of April 30, 1802 (section 7) [[Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt; set forth the boundaries of the new state and arranged for election of delegates to a state constitutional convention to meet later that year.  The Second proposition of Section 7 of the act states "That the six mile reservation, including the salt springs, commonly called the Scioto salt springs, the salt springs near the Muskingum river, and in the military tract, with the sections of land which include the same, shall be granted to the said state for the use of the people thereof, the same to be used under such terms and conditions and regulations as the legislature of the said state shall direct: Provided, the said legislature shall never sell nor lease the same for a longer period than ten years."

==State Action==
The state legislature provided for leasing these lands for salt production.  They were cared for by agents, and rental was charged for the right to make salt.  In 1803 the rental was three cents per year for each gallon of kettle capacity used in boiling the water.  The rental rate declined periodically, until by 1810, the rental rate was just five mills (½ cent).&lt;ref name=ohiosub/&gt;

The Scioto salt springs were extensively developed.  The salt was carried by pack horse to settlements, and sold for up to eight dollars per hundred pounds in 1801.  The salt springs on the Muskingum were also worked, but the Delaware county springs invited little attention.&lt;ref name=ohiosub/&gt;

==Tract Location==
===Scioto Salt Reservation===
The reservation was in the survey called the [[Congress Lands East of Scioto River]] in present-day [[Jackson County, Ohio]].  It consisted of eight sections of township 6, range 18, four sections of township 6, range 19, sixteen sections of township 7, range 18, and eight sections of township 7, range 19. {{coord|39|02|53|N|82|38|02|W|name= Scioto Salt Reservation}}

By 1816, a settlement had grown around the spring, and Ohio wished to form [[Jackson County, Ohio|Jackson county]].  They petitioned Congress to allow sale of a section of salt land to pay for a county courthouse.  The Act of April 16, 1816&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|6|161}} - Text of Act of April 16, 1816 [[Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt; allowed this action, and section 29 of township 7 of range 18 was sold for $7,169.00 and the town of [[Jackson, Ohio|Jackson]] was erected there.&lt;ref name=ohiosub/&gt;  The remainder of the reserve was surveyed into {{convert|80|acre|m2|adj=on}} tracts, numbered in each township in a like manner as the sections.

===Muskingum Salt Reservations===

The reservations were two {{convert|640|acre|km2|adj=on}} sections of land in [[Muskingum County, Ohio]], section 13 of township 13 of range 12 {{coord|39|53|59|N|81|49|14|W|name= Muskingum Salt Reservation (east)}}, and section 9 of township 11 of range 13 {{coord|39|52|41|N|81|56|48|W|name= Muskingum Salt Reservation (west)}} of the [[Congress Lands East of Scioto River]]&lt;ref name=ohiosub/&gt;

===Delaware Salt Reservation===

The reservation was a four thousand acre (16&amp;nbsp;km²) tract of land in [[Delaware County, Ohio]] consisting of quarter 1 of township 5 of range 18 of the [[United States Military District]] {{coord|40|20|39|N|82|56|54|W|name= Delaware Salt Reservation}}&lt;ref name=ohiosub/&gt;

==Sale of Salt Lands==

By 1824, salt springs had been found to be not so rare as previously thought, and worries over monopolization diminished.  Ohio petitioned Congress to sell the rest of the salt lands.  The Act of December 28, 1824 allowed this sale, with "the proceeds thereof to be applied to such literary purposes as the legislature may hereafter direct; and to no other use, intent, or purpose whatsoever."&lt;ref name=officialohio/&gt;&lt;ref name=ohiosub/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|4|79}} - Text of Act of December 28, 1824 [[Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other States==

Some other states were granted six sections around each salt spring as in the table, which may be incomplete.&lt;ref name=pubdomain&gt;{{cite book |title=The Public Domain.

==Saline Lands Act==

In 1877, Congress changed the treatment of saline lands.  The Act of January 12, 1877&lt;ref name=act1877&gt;{{USStat|19|221}} - Text of Act of January 12, 1877 [[Google books]]&lt;/ref&gt; was called '''An act providing for the sale of Saline lands'''.  It provided that any lands determined by the officers of a land office to be saline in character 

{{quote|…shall be offered for sale by public auction at the local land office of the district in which the same shall be situated, under such regulations as shall be prescribed by the Commissioner of the [[General Land Office]], and sold to the highest bidder for cash, at a price of not less than one dollar and twenty five cents per acre… …Provided, That the foregoing enactments shall not apply to any State or Territory which has not had a grant of salines by act of Congress, nor to any State which may have had such a grant, until either the grant has been fully satisfied, or the right of selection thereunder has expired by efflux of time.|Act of January 12, 1877&lt;ref name=act1877/&gt;}}

The '''Sanvitale conspiracy''' ({{lang-it|congiura dei Sanvitale}}) was a plot to assassinate [[Ranuccio I Farnese]], Duke of [[Duchy of Parma|Parma]] and [[Piacenza]], and members of his family at the baptism of his new-born son Alessandro in 1611. The conspiracy may also be referred to in Italian as the {{lang|it|congiura dei feudatari}}, "conspiracy of the feudal lords", or as the {{lang|it|congiura del 1611}}, "conspiracy of 1611".&lt;ref name=pado/&gt;

The plot was exposed and the conspirators were arrested and tortured.&lt;ref name=arch/&gt; They were found guilty of ''[[lèse-majesté]]'' and ten of them were publicly executed in Parma on 19 May 1612; the event was called the {{lang|it|gran giustizia}}, or "great justice", and attracted attention throughout Italy and abroad. The ''gran giustizia'' brought immediate advantages to the Farnese, who were at the same time rid of troublesome rivals and enriched by the appropriation of their money and lands. However many, including some in powerful foreign courts, believed that the plot had been entirely fabricated by Ranuccio for exactly these purposes. Ranuccio's reputation was seriously and permanently damaged. The question of whether the plot was real or a fabrication is still open.&lt;ref name=mup/&gt;

==Background==

[[File:Barbara Sanseverino.jpg|thumb|250px|Barbara Sanseverino, portrait by an unknown painter, now in the Palazzo Ducale of [[Colorno]]]]
The Sanvitale conspiracy was the third plot against the Farnese family in the space of seventy years. The first was the successful conspiracy, supported or instigated by [[Ferrante Gonzaga]], of Giovanni Francesco Anguissola, Gianluigi Confalonieri, Agostino Landi and Alessandro, Camillo and Gerolamo Pallavicino to assassinate [[Pier Luigi Farnese]], who was stabbed to death by Anguissola and two hired killers in [[Piacenza]] on 10 September 1547. The second was the failed conspiracy of Claudio Landi, Prince of [[Val di Taro]], with Giambattista Anguissola and Giammaria and Cammillo Scotti to assassinate [[Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma]] in 1582, following which Landi lost the Val di Taro to the Farnese, and the other conspirators lost their heads.&lt;ref name=arch/&gt;

Barbara Sanseverino was heiress to the [[fief]] of [[Colorno]], which her ancestor [[Roberto Sanseverino, Conte di Caiazzo]] had received from [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco Sforza]] in 1458. She had married on 6 September 1564, in her  fifteenth year, [[Giberto IV Sanvitale]], Duca di Sala, and following his death in 1585 had obtained from [[Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma|Ottavio Farnese]] a decree that allowed her to pass Colorno to their only son Girolamo Sanvitale. In  the early 1600s this was contested by Ranuccio Farnese on the grounds that the fief could not pass by maternal succession. He claimed Colorno, and sent troops to occupy it.&lt;ref name=pado/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9203">The '''Sri Lanka National Pharmaceuticals Policy''' was established in the 1970s following the submission of a report by Dr [[S.A. Wickremasinghe]] and Prof. [[Seneka Bibile]]. It aimed at ensuring that people get good quality [[Medication|drugs]] at the lowest possible price and that doctors would prescribe the minimum required drugs to treat the patient's illness. It was a pioneer in the field of rational [[National pharmaceuticals policy]].

== Background ==
At the time, [[pharmaceutical companies]] were making considerable money by selling drugs under their [[trade name]]s, giving out biased information about the [[brand]]ed drugs as against those named generically. Doctors often prescribed branded drugs, which were far more expensive than [[generic drugs]], which have the same efficacy.

The [[United Front (Sri Lanka)|United Front]] Government of 1970 appointed the Wickremasinghe-Bibile commission of inquiry into this issue and it recommended the establishment a national policy and of a state body to regularise the trade.

In the 1970s [[Sri Lanka]] demonstrated that a state buying agency linked to a national formulary was a viable and powerful instrument for reducing drug costs without compromising quality, for saving foreign exchange, for rationalising drug usage and for supplying [[essential drugs]] at reasonable prices to the whole community. This was made possible by the  formulation and implementation of an integrated [[national pharmaceutical policy]].

A unique phenomenon about Sri Lanka's pharmaceuticals policy was that the entire programme was conceived, formulated, developed and implemented by Sri Lankan nationals without any form of external aid or assistance.

== National formulary ==
A careful selection of drugs is an essential prerequisite of a national pharmaceutical policy. In Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Health requested Prof. Seneka Bibile to look into his matter and he prepared the [[Ceylon Hospital Formulary]] (CHF) of about 630 drugs under their [[International Nonproprietary Name|generic name]]s. Subsequently the Ministry of Health established a [[National Formulary Committee]] (NFC), consisting of representatives from the public and private health sectors and the University Medical Schools, led by Bibile. It published ''Formulary Notes'' for doctors, keeping them updated on developments.

== State buying agency ==
Accordingly, in 1971 the [[State Pharmaceuticals Corporation of Sri Lanka]] (SPC) was established with Bibile as Chairman. The SPC channelled all imports and production of pharmaceuticals, calling for worldwide bulk [[Request for tender|tenders]] which were limited to the approved drugs listed in the CHF. The public and private health sectors had to obtain all their requirements from the SPC.

Hence the stranglehold of the [[Multinational corporation]]s on the drug trade was successfully broken and they were made to compete with each other and with generic drug producers, enabling the country to obtain drugs much cheaper. Branded drugs were replaced by generic drugs in the prescription and sale of medicines.

In 1972 it imported 52 drugs at a third of their previous prices. In 1973, the SPC itself bought the raw material necessary for 14 private processing laboratories established in the island. Some drug prices dropped by half or two-thirds. The SPC bought from an Indian company the raw material necessary for a widely used tranquilliser at a much lower price than that charged by a Swiss multinational.

== Drug information ==
It is essential that correct information on drugs and therapeutics be given to all medical personnel. The promotional material provided by the drugs manufacturers tends to be distorted in favour of their own products and adds to the costs of supplying drugs.

In Sri Lanka, drug information was provided from official sources. ''[[The Prescriber]]'', a quarterly publication edited by the NFC, was published by the SPC and distributed to all medical personnel. The extravagant promotional practices of drugs manufacturers were stopped to remove the dangers and costs inherent in process.

== International experience ==
The Sri Lanka experience became a model for the rest of the world. The policy was supported by the [[World Health Organization]] and other [[United Nations]] agencies with enormous benefit to Third World countries. The [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] Secretariat examined the Sri Lankan experience, concluding that an analysis of the Sri Lankan model could give other developing countries an insight into ways of formulating, developing and implementing integrated national pharmaceutical policies. With Bibile’s assistance, it  published "Case Studies in the Transfer of Technology: Pharmaceutical Policies in Sri Lanka". [https://web.archive.org/web/20041223192702/http://r0.unctad.org/en/pressref/stdissue.htm] This document has proved to be a very valuable guideline for developing countries intending to initiate pharmaceutical reforms. Translated into other languages, it may be found with health planners of almost every Third World country.

== Reaction of pharmaceutical companies==
The first response from the multi-national corporations came in May 1973. Executives of the major [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] in the United States met Sri Lanka's ambassador in [[Washington, D.C.]] and handed him a letter addressed to the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka from the President of the [[Pharmaceutical Manufacturer's Association]] (PMA) of the US. The letter concluded with a statement that the PMA believed that the proposed actions would have most serious effects not only on the pharmaceutical industry and on all private industry in Sri Lanka but potentially for the health of its citizens.

The [[International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations]] (IFPMA) issued a statement to UNCTAD strongly criticising the UNCTAD report on the Sri Lankan pharmaceutical policies.

== Post-1977 policy ==
This policy was watered down by the multi-national-friendly [[United National Party]] Government of 1977. There was continued government control of the types of drugs imported, but permission was given to the private sector to import multiple brands. The SPC was never dissolved and continued to supply affordable drugs, continuing to be responsible for centralised procurement for the government health sector.

In 1987 the Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation was established to import raw materials and manufacture generic drugs. This has effectively withstood very strong pressures for privatisation.

The earlier centrally controlled system enabled effective monitoring. However, at present, because of decentralisation of drug supply, while standard treatment guidelines are available, there is no effective monitoring system for prescription practices is in place; there is little quality assessment and no incentive for rational use.

In 2005 the [[United People's Freedom Alliance]] Government promised to establish a [[National Medicinal Drugs Policy]] (NMPD) that would enable Sri Lankans significantly to cut down on drug expenses and get quality drugs at affordable prices while saving billions of [[Sri Lankan rupee|rupee]]s in foreign exchange for the country. Implementation of the NMDP could reduce the number of drugs imported, prescribed and sold in Sri Lanka to about 350 varieties.
