'''{{mp|2018 GE|3}}''' is a sub-kilometer [[asteroid]] on a highly eccentric orbit, classified as a [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]], approximately {{convert|48|-|110|m|ft|abbr=off|sigfig=2|sp=us}} in diameter. It was first observed on 14 April 2018, by astronomers with the [[Catalina Sky Survey]] one day prior to its sub-lunar close encounter with [[Earth]] at 0.5 [[lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]].&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt; It is one of the largest known asteroids (possibly the largest) in observational history to ever pass that close to Earth ''(also see [[#CAD-history|list]])''.

== Orbit and classification ==

{{mp|2018 GE|3}} is a member of the near-Earth population of asteroids known as [[Apollo asteroid|Apollos]].&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; Apollo asteroids [[List of Earth-crossing minor planets|cross the orbit of Earth]] and are the largest group of near-Earth objects with nearly 10 thousand known members. Based on an [[observation arc]] of 4 days, it orbits the [[Sun]] at a distance of 0.3–3.4&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 2 years and 6 months (918 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 1.85&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an unusually high [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.83 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 9[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; It is also a [[Mercury-crosser|Mercury-]], [[Venus-crosser|Venus-]] and [[Mars-crosser]], reaching its furthest point from the Sun in the [[Kirkwood gap|outer]] [[asteroid belt]]. The body's observation arc begins at Steward Observatory's Catalina Station with its first observation in April 2018.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

=== Close encounters ===

In observational history, and other than possibly [[2002 MN]] and {{mpl|2017 VW|13}}, this asteroid is the largest known object to ever pass that close to Earth, as well as the [[Moon]] ''(also see [[#CAD-history|History of closest approaches of large near-Earth objects]])''.{{efn|name=clarification}} [[99942&amp;nbsp;Apophis]] will break both of these records when it approaches only {{convert|0.000252|AU|LD|abbr=on|lk=on|sigfig=2|order=flip}} from Earth on 13 April 2029.

{{mp|2018 GE|3}} was first observed on 14 April 2018, at 09:23 [[Universal Time|UT]] by astronomers at [[Steward Observatory]]'s [[Catalina Station]], Arizona, the day prior to its close encounter with Earth.

It had been more than 120 degrees from the Sun since March 2018, but was simply too far and too faint to be detected by automated surveys. Despite coming from directly away from the Sun, it was not discovered until 14 April 2018, only one day prior to its closest approach. If the most advanced survey telescopes had been looking at its location, it could have been discovered as early as 30 March. On 15 April 2018, at 06:41 UT, this object passed Earth at a nominal distance of {{convert|0.001289|AU|LD|abbr=on|lk=in|sigfig=2|order=flip}} which corresponds to a distance of {{convert|193000|km|mi|abbr=off|lk=off}}, at a speed of {{convert|29.5|km/s|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EarthSky" /&gt; The object also approached the Moon at an even closer distance of {{convert|0.00087|AU|LD|abbr=on|lk=off|sigfig=2|order=flip}} a few hours later, at 09:59 UT.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

It was the 32nd known [[List of asteroid close approaches to Earth in 2018#Timeline of close approaches less than one lunar distance from Earth|asteroid to flyby Earth within 1&amp;nbsp;lunar distance]] ([[Lunar distance (astronomy)|LD]]) since the start of 2018 and 16th closest, although it was the largest known asteroid to pass within half a lunar distance. After closest approach its [[apparent magnitude]] dropped from 12 to 35 in less than 12 hours, heading towards the Sun. Coming from the opposite direction, it would have been impossible to observe before its approach. A preliminary analysis of the orbit of {{mp|2018 GE|3}} shows that this is the closest this particular asteroid has come to Earth since at least 1930.&lt;ref name="EarthSky" /&gt;

{{Large near earth asteroid flybys 1LD}}

Asteroid [[2002 MN]] passed closer to Earth than {{mp|2018 GE|3}} in 2002, and had a brighter [[absolute magnitude (H)]] of 23.6, and could be either larger or smaller than {{mp|2018 GE|3}}, depending on their [[Astronomical albedo|albedo]]s and thus exact sizes. {{mpl|2017 VW|13}} (H=20.7) may have also passed closer in 2001, although the distance of its approach is very uncertain and it was not discovered until 2017.&lt;ref name="jpl-2017vw13"/&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Diameter and albedo ===

The diameter can only be estimated based on the brightness and distance. The albedo is currently unknown. Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, {{mp|2018 GE|3}} measures between {{convert|48|-|100|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter, for an [[Absolute magnitude#Solar System bodies (H)|absolute magnitude]] of 23.8,&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; and an assumed [[Astronomical albedo|albedo]] between 0.05 and 0.24, which represent typical values for [[C-type asteroid|carbonaceous]] and [[S-type asteroid|stony]] asteroids, respectively.&lt;ref name="h" /&gt;

This asteroid is about three to six times the diameter of the [[Chelyabinsk_meteor|meteor that exploded]] in the skies above [[Chelyabinsk]], Russia in February 2013, which damaged over 7,200 buildings and injured 1,500 people, mostly from flying glass. If an asteroid of this size were to enter Earth's [[atmosphere]], a good portion of it would likely [[Vaporization|disintegrate]] due to friction with the air. The remnants could survive entry however and impact the [[Planetary surface|surface]], thus causing regional damage dependent on various factors such as composition, speed, entry angle, and location of [[Impact event|impact]].&lt;ref name="EarthSky" /&gt;

=== Rotation period ===

As of 2018, no rotational [[lightcurve]] of {{mp|2018 GE|3}} has been obtained from [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] observations. The body's [[rotation period]], [[Poles of astronomical bodies|pole]] and shape remain unknown.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== Numbering and naming ==

This [[minor planet]] has neither been numbered nor [[List of named minor planets (alphabetical)|named]].&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

== See also ==
* [[List of asteroid close approaches to Earth]]
* [[List of asteroid close approaches to Earth in 2018]]
* [[2018 AH]], a slightly larger asteroid that also passed unusually close to Earth in 2018.

== Notes ==
{{notelist|refs=

{{efn|name=clarification|1=[[2002 MN]] has a brighter [[Absolute_magnitude#Solar System bodies (H)|absolute magnitude]] than this asteroid (23.6 vs. 23.8) and may therefor be larger. Note that the term "observational history" excludes objects such as {{mpl|2017 VW|13}} not yet discovered at the time of close approach. Furthermore, {{mp|2017 VW|13}}'s orbit is uncertain enough that it may not have passed closer than {{mp|2018 GE|3}} at all.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10665">{{Technical|date=September 2018}}In [[political theory|political]] and [[social theory]], '''accelerationism''' is the idea that either the prevailing system of [[capitalism]], or certain technosocial processes that have historically characterised it, should be expanded, repurposed, or accelerated in order to generate radical social change. Some contemporary accelerationist philosophy takes as its starting point the [[Deleuze and Guattari|Deleuzo-Guattarian]] theory of [[deterritorialisation]], aiming to identify, deepen, and radicalise the forces of deterritorialisation with a view to overcoming the [[reterritorialization|countervailing tendencies]] that suppress the possibility of far-reaching social transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wolfendale |first=Peter |url=http://deontologistics.tumblr.com/post/91953882443/so-accelerationism-whats-all-that-about| title=So, Accelerationism, what's all that about? |website=Dialectical Insurgency&lt;!--Peter Wolfendale's personal blog --&gt; |year= 2014|access-date= 5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=November 2015}} Accelerationism may also refer more broadly, and usually pejoratively, to support for the deepening of capitalism in the belief that this will hasten its self-destructive tendencies and ultimately lead to its collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shaviro |first=Steven |year=2010 |title=Post Cinematic Affect |url= |location=Ropley |publisher=O Books |page= 136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Jason |year=2013 |title=Occupy Time: Technoculture, Immediacy, and Resistance After Occupy Wall Street |url= |location=New York |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page= 96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accelerationist theory has been divided into mutually contradictory [[left-wing]] and [[right-wing]] variants.  "Left-accelerationism" attempts to press "the process of technological evolution" beyond the constrictive horizon of capitalism, for example by repurposing modern technology for socially beneficial and emancipatory ends; "right-accelerationism" supports the indefinite intensification of capitalism itself, possibly in order to bring about a [[technological singularity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cccb.org/lab/en/article_el-vertigen-acceleracionista-ii-entrevista-a-robin-mackay/|title=The Accelerationist Vertigo (II): Interview with Robin Mackay|first=Roc|last=Jiménez de Cisneros|publisher=[[Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona]]|date=5 November 2014|access-date=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/05/14/accelerate-manifesto-for-an-accelerationist-politics/|title=#ACCELERATE MANIFESTO for an Accelerationist Politics|publisher=Critical Legal Thinking|first1=Alex|last1=Williams|first2=Nick|last2=Srnicek|date=14 May 2013|access-date=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufblog.net/accelerate/|title=#Accelerate|date=13 February 2014|access-date=5 February 2015|first1=Nick|last1=Land|website=Urban Future (2.1)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

A number of philosophers have expressed apparently accelerationist attitudes, including [[Karl Marx]] in his 1848 speech "On the Question of Free Trade":
:But, in general, the protective system of our day is conservative, while the free trade system is destructive. It breaks up old nationalities and pushes the antagonism of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to the extreme point. In a word, the free trade system hastens the social revolution. It is in this revolutionary sense alone, gentlemen, that I vote in favor of free trade.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/free-trade/ On the question of free trade], Speech to the Democratic Association of Brussels, 9 January 1848.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a similar vein, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] argued that "the leveling process of European man is the great process which should not be checked: one should even accelerate it...",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book |last=Strong |first=Tracy |year=1988 |title=Friedrich Nietzsche and the Politics of Transfiguration |url= |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |page= 211}} Original in ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'' §898.&lt;/ref&gt; a statement often simplified, following Deleuze and Guattari, to a command to "accelerate the process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Deleuze |first1=Gilles |last2=Guattari |first2=Félix |year=2004 |title=Anti-Oedipus |url= |location=London |publisher=Continuum |page= 260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary accelerationism==

Along accelerationist lines, [[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]], in works such as ''[[PostCapitalism: A Guide to our Future]]'', has tried to speculate about futures after capitalism. He declares that "[a]s with the end of feudalism 500 years ago, capitalism’s replacement by postcapitalism will be accelerated by external shocks and shaped by the emergence of a new kind of human being. And it has started." He considers that the rise of collaborative production will eventually help capitalism to kill itself.

Focusing on how information technology infrastructures undermine modern political geographies, and proposing an open-ended "design brief",  [[Benjamin H. Bratton]]'s book ''The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty'' is associated with accelerationism. [[Tiziana Terranova]]'s "Red Stack Attack!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euronomade.info/?p=2268|title=Red Stack Attack!

In a [[computer]], the '''Advanced Configuration and Power Interface''' ('''ACPI''') provides an [[open standard]] that [[operating system]]s can use to discover and configure [[computer hardware]] components, to perform [[power management]] by (for example) putting unused components to sleep, and to perform status monitoring. First released in December 1996, ACPI aims to replace [[Advanced Power Management]] (APM), the [[MultiProcessor Specification]], and the [[Plug and Play BIOS]] (PnP) Specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acpi.info/presentations/ACPI_Overview.pdf |website=www.acpi.info |title=ACPI Overview |format=[[slide show]] in PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACPI brings the power management under the control of the operating system, as opposed to the previous BIOS-centric system that relied on platform-specific firmware to determine power management and configuration policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | format=RTF
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specification is central to the '''Operating System-directed configuration and Power Management''' ('''OSPM''') system, an implementation for ACPI which removes device management responsibilities from legacy firmware interfaces via a UI.

Internally, ACPI advertises the available components and their functions to the [[operating system kernel]] using instruction lists ("methods") provided through the system [[firmware]] ([[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface]] (UEFI) or [[BIOS]]), which the kernel parses. ACPI then executes the desired operations (such as the initialization of hardware components) using an embedded minimal [[virtual machine]].

[[Intel]], [[Microsoft]] and [[Toshiba]] originally developed the standard, while [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Huawei]] and [[Phoenix Technologies|Phoenix]] also participated later. In October 2013 the original developers of the ACPI standard agreed to transfer all assets to the [[Unified EFI Forum|UEFI Forum]], in which all future development will take place.&lt;ref name="acpi-october-2013"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{Anchor|AML|ASL}}Architecture ==
The firmware-level ACPI has three main components: the ACPI tables, the ACPI BIOS, and the ACPI registers.  Unlike its predecessors, such as the APM or PnP BIOS, the ACPI implements little of its functionality in the ACPI BIOS code, whose main role is to load the ACPI tables in system memory. Instead, most of the firmware ACPI functionality is provided in ''ACPI Machine Language'' (AML) [[bytecode]] stored in the ACPI tables. To make use of these tables, the operating system must have an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] for the AML bytecode. A reference AML interpreter implementation is provided by the ACPI Component Architecture (ACPICA). At the BIOS development time, AML bytecode is compiled from the ASL (ACPI Source Language) code.&lt;ref name="freebsd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ols2005" /&gt;

As ACPI also replaces PnP BIOS, it also provides a hardware enumerator, mostly implemented in the Differentiated System Description Table (DSDT) ACPI table. The advantage of a bytecode approach is that unlike PnP BIOS code (which was 16-bit), the ACPI bytecode may be used in any operating system, even in 64-bit [[long mode]].&lt;ref name="ols2005"&gt;[https://www.kernel.org/doc/ols/2005/ols2005v1-pages-59-76.pdf ACPI in Linux], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall design decision was not without criticism. In November 2003, [[Linus Torvalds]]—author of the [[Linux kernel]]—described ACPI as "a complete design disaster in every way".&lt;ref name="linux-mag-162"&gt;Linux Magazine issue 162, May 2014, page 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, other senior Linux software developers like [[Alan Cox]] expressed concerns about the requirements that [[bytecode]] from an external source must be run by the kernel with full privileges, as well as the overall complexity of the ACPI specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== {{Anchor|ACPICA}}ACPI Component Architecture (ACPICA) ===
&lt;!-- [[ACPI Component Architecture]] and [[ACPICA]] redirect here. --&gt;
The '''ACPI Component Architecture''' ('''ACPICA'''), mainly written by Intel's engineers, provides an [[Open-source software|open-source]] platform-independent reference implementation of the operating system&amp;ndash;related ACPI code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acpica.org/ ACPICA: ACPI Component Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ACPICA code is used by Linux, [[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]] and FreeBSD,&lt;ref name="freebsd"&gt;[http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix02/tech/freenix/full_papers/watanabe/watanabe.ps ACPI implementation on FreeBSD - Usenix]&lt;/ref&gt; which supplement it with their operating-system specific code.

== History ==
The first revision of the ACPI specification was released in December 1996, supporting 16 and [[32-bit]] addressing spaces.  It was not until August 2000 that ACPI received [[64-bit]] address support as well as support for multiprocessor workstations and servers with revision 2.0.

In September 2004, revision 3.0 was released, bringing to the ACPI specification support for [[SATA]] controllers, [[PCI Express]] bus, [[multiprocessor]] support for more than 256 processors, [[ambient light sensors]] and user-presence devices, as well as extending the thermal model beyond the previous processor-centric support.

Released in June 2009, revision 4.0 of the ACPI specification added various new features to the design; most notable are the [[USB&amp;nbsp;3.0]] support, logical processor idling support, and [[x2APIC]] support.

Revision 5.0 of the ACPI specification was released in December 2011,&lt;ref name="spec-5.0" &gt;{{cite web

== Operating systems ==
Microsoft's [[Windows 98]] was the first operating system to implement ACPI,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.physik.hu-berlin.de/pub/driver/grafik/armada1120/RMF98/DISK1/WINDOW~1.PDF |title=Limitations When Using Microsoft Windows 98 on Compaq Armada Portables |page=3 |date=October 1998 |accessdate=2014-01-27 |publisher=physik.hu-berlin.de |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/guides-and-manuals/detail.page?&amp;LegacyDocID=LWIK-3VJLL8 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203005405/http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/guides-and-manuals/detail.page?&amp;LegacyDocID=LWIK-3VJLL8 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-02-03 |title=Windows 98 on ThinkPad systems - ThinkPad General |publisher=Support.lenovo.com |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its implementation was somewhat buggy or incomplete,&lt;ref name="CowartKnittel2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Cowart|author2=Brian Knittel|title=Using Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XCGv2VgjJk4C&amp;pg=PA30|date=2000|publisher=Que Publishing|isbn=978-0-7897-2125-9|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/189091 Windows 98 Does Not Support ACPI Passive Cooling Mode]&lt;/ref&gt; although some of the problems associated with it were caused by the first-generation ACPI hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991013055230/http://winmag.com/library/1998/1201/cov0066.htm |archivedate=October 13, 1999 |website=winmag.com |url=http://winmag.com/library/1998/1201/cov0066.htm |title=Cover Story: Win98 Bugs &amp; Fixes - December 1998 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows 98 first edition disabled ACPI by default except on a whitelist of systems.  Other operating systems, including later versions of [[Windows]], [[eComStation]], [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], [[HP-UX]], [[OpenVMS]], [[Linux kernel|Linux]], and [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] versions of [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], have at least some support for ACPI.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Windows Vista sometimes will not work with a motherboards ACPI.

The 2.4 series of the Linux kernel had only minimal support for ACPI, with better support implemented (and enabled by default) from kernel version 2.6.0 onwards.&lt;ref name="ols2004"&gt;[https://www.kernel.org/doc/ols/2004/ols2004v1-pages-121-132.pdf The State of ACPI in the Linux Kernel]&lt;/ref&gt; Old ACPI BIOS implementations tend to be quite buggy, and consequently are not supported by later operating systems. For example, [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP]], and [[Windows Server 2003]] only use ACPI if the BIOS date is after January 1, 1999, and for Windows 98 Second Edition this date is December 1, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff540487(v=vs.85).aspx ACPI BIOS]. ''msdn.microsoft.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Linux kernel 2.6 blacklisted any ACPI BIOS from before January 1, 2001.&lt;ref name="ols2004"/&gt;

== OSPM responsibilities ==
Once an OSPM-compatible operating system activates ACPI, it takes exclusive control of all aspects of power management and device configuration. The OSPM implementation must expose an ACPI-compatible environment to device drivers, which exposes certain system, device and processor states.

==== {{Anchor|GSTATES}}Global states ====
&lt;!-- [[G state]] and [[S state]] redirect here. --&gt;
The ACPI specification defines the following four global "Gx" states and six sleep "Sx" states for an ACPI-compliant computer system:&lt;ref&gt;ACPI Spec Rev 5.0 - dated December 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''G0'' (''S0''), ''Working'': The computer is running and the CPU executes instructions. "Awaymode" is a subset of S0, where monitor is off but background tasks are running.
* ''G1'', ''Sleeping'':  Divided into four states, S1 through S4:
** ''S1'', ''Power on Suspend (POS)'': Processor caches are flushed, and the CPU(s) stops executing instructions. The power to the CPU(s) and RAM is maintained. Devices that do not indicate they must remain on may be powered off.
** ''S2'': CPU powered off. [[Dirty cache]] is flushed to RAM.
** ''S3'', commonly referred to as  ''Standby'', ''[[Sleep mode|Sleep]]'', or ''Suspend to RAM (STR)'': [[RAM]] remains powered.
** ''S4'', ''[[Hibernation (computing)|Hibernation]]'' or ''Suspend to Disk'': All content of the [[RAM|main memory]] is saved to [[non-volatile memory]] such as a [[hard drive]], and the system is powered down.
* ''G2'' (''S5''), ''Soft Off'': G2/S5 is almost the same as G3 ''Mechanical Off'', except that the [[Power supply unit (computer)|power supply unit]] (PSU) still supplies power, at a minimum, to the power button to allow return to S0. A full reboot is required.  No previous content is retained. Other components may remain powered so the computer can "wake" on input from the keyboard, clock, [[Wake-on-Ring|modem]], [[Wake on LAN|LAN]], or [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] device.
* ''G3'', ''Mechanical Off'': The computer's power has been totally removed via a mechanical switch (as on the rear of a PSU). The power cord can be removed and the system is safe for disassembly (typically, only the [[real-time clock]] continues to run using its own small battery).

The specification also defines a ''Legacy'' state: the state on an operating system which does not support ACPI. In this state, the hardware and power are not managed via ACPI, effectively disabling ACPI.

==== Device states ====
&lt;!-- [[D state]] redirects here. --&gt;

The device states ''D0''–''D3'' are device dependent:
* ''D0'' or ''Fully On'' is the operating state.
* ''D1'' and ''D2'' are intermediate power-states whose definition varies by device.
* ''D3'': The D3 state is further divided into ''D3 Hot'' (has aux power), and ''D3 Cold'' (no power provided):
** ''Hot'': A device can assert power management requests to transition to higher power states.
** ''Cold'' or ''Off'' has the device powered off and unresponsive to its bus.

=== {{Anchor|CPU-states|CPU-STATES|POWER-STATES}}Processor states ===
&lt;!-- [[C state]] redirects here. --&gt;
The CPU power states ''C0''–''C3'' are defined as follows:

* ''C0'' is the operating state.
* ''C1'' (often known as ''Halt'') is a state where the processor is not executing instructions, but can return to an executing state essentially instantaneously. All ACPI-conformant processors must support this power state. Some processors, such as the [[Pentium 4]], also support an Enhanced C1 state (''C1E'' or Enhanced Halt State) for lower power consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''C2'' (often known as ''Stop-Clock'') is a state where the processor maintains all software-visible state, but may take longer to wake up. This processor state is optional.
* ''C3'' (often known as ''Sleep'') is a state where the processor does not need to keep its [[Cache coherence|cache coherent]], but maintains other state. Some processors have variations on the C3 state (Deep Sleep, Deeper Sleep, etc.) that differ in how long it takes to wake the processor. This processor state is optional.
* ''Additional states'' are defined by manufacturers for some processors. For example, [[Intel]]'s [[Haswell (microarchitecture)|Haswell]] platform has states up to ''C10'', where it distinguishes ''core'' states and ''package'' states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance states ===
&lt;!-- [[P state]] redirects here. --&gt;

While a device or processor operates (D0 and C0, respectively), it can be in one of several [[Dynamic voltage scaling|power-performance states]]. These states are implementation-dependent. Though, P0 is always the highest-performance state; with P1 to P''n'' being successively lower-performance states, up to an implementation-specific limit of ''n'' no greater than 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Hardware interface ==
ACPI-compliant systems interact with hardware through either a "Function Fixed Hardware (FFH) Interface", or a platform-independent hardware programming model which relies on platform-specific ACPI Machine Language (AML) provided by the [[original equipment manufacturer]] (OEM).

Function Fixed Hardware interfaces are platform-specific features, provided by platform manufacturers for the purposes of performance and failure recovery. Standard [[Intel]]-based [[IBM PC Compatible|PCs]] have a fixed function interface defined by Intel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides a set of core functionality that reduces an ACPI-compliant system's need for full driver stacks for providing basic functionality during boot time or in the case of major system failure.

ACPI Platform Error Interface (APEI) is a specification for reporting of hardware errors, e.g. from the chipset, to the operating system.

== {{Anchor|DSDT|SSDT|SRAT}}Firmware interface ==
ACPI defines many tables that provide the interface between an ACPI-compliant operating system, and system firmware. This includes Differentiated System Description Table (DSDT), Secondary System Description Table (SSDT), and Static Resource Affinity Table (SRAT), for example.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
| citeseerx          = 10.1.1.173.2206

| date        = 2005-07-20
| work        = Ottawa Linux Symposium
| page        = 3
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The tables allow description of system hardware in a platform-independent manner, and are presented as either fixed-formatted data structures or in AML. The main AML table is the DSDT (differentiated system description table).

The Root System Description Pointer is located in a platform-dependent manner, and describes the rest of the tables.

== Security risks ==

[[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] Linux founder [[Mark Shuttleworth]] has likened ACPI to [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Shuttleworth blog (2014-03-17), [http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1332 ACPI, firmware and your security]&lt;/ref&gt; He has described [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] firmware (ACPI-related or any other firmware) as a security risk, saying that "firmware on your device is the [[NSA]]'s best friend" and calling firmware (ACPI or non-ACPI) "a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]] of monumental proportions". He has pointed out that low quality, [[closed source]] firmware is a major threat to system security:&lt;ref name="linux-mag-162"/&gt; "Your biggest mistake is to assume that the [[NSA]] is the only institution abusing this position of trust — in fact, it's reasonable to assume that all firmware is a cesspool of insecurity, courtesy of incompetence of the highest degree from manufacturers, and competence of the highest degree from a very wide range of such agencies".

As a solution to this problem, he has called for [[declarative programming|declarative]] firmware (ACPI or non-ACPI).&lt;ref name="linux-mag-162"/&gt; Firmware should be [[Open-source software|open-source]] so that the code can be checked and verified. Firmware should be declarative, meaning that it should describe "hardware linkage and dependencies" and should not include [[executable code]].

'''Atmospheric optics''' deals with how the unique [[optics|optical]] properties of [[Earth's atmosphere]] cause a wide range of spectacular [[optical phenomenon|optical phenomena]]. The [[diffuse sky radiation|blue color]] of the [[sky]] is a direct result of [[Rayleigh scattering]], which redirects higher [[frequency]] ([[blue]]) [[sunlight]] back into the field of view of the [[observation|observer]]. Because blue light is [[light scattering|scattered]] more easily than red light, the [[Sun]] takes on a reddish hue when it is observed through a [[air mass (astronomy)|thick atmosphere]], as during a [[sunrise]] or [[sunset]].
[[File:Pink purple sky clouds.jpg|thumb|Pink/purple sky in [[Nieuw-Vennep]]]]
Additional [[particulates|particulate matter]] in the sky can scatter different colors at different angles, creating colorful, [[alpenglow|glowing]] skies at [[dusk]] and [[dawn]]. Scattering off of [[ice crystal]]s and other particles in the atmosphere are responsible for [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halos]], [[afterglow]]s, [[corona (meteorology)|coronas]], [[crepuscular rays]], and [[sun dog]]s. The variation in these kinds of phenomena is due to different particle sizes and geometries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C. D. Ahrens|year=1994|title=Meteorology Today: an introduction to weather, climate, and the environment|edition = 5th|pages=88–89|publisher=West Publishing Company|isbn=0-314-02779-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mirage]]s are optical phenomena in which light rays are bent due to thermal variations in the refraction index of air, producing displaced or heavily distorted images of distant objects. Other optical phenomena associated with this include the [[Novaya Zemlya effect]], where the Sun appears to rise earlier or set later than predicted with a distorted shape. A spectacular form of refraction, called the [[Fata Morgana (mirage)|Fata Morgana]], occurs with a [[inversion (meteorology)|temperature inversion]], in which objects on the horizon or even beyond the horizon (e.g. islands, cliffs, ships, and icebergs) appear elongated and elevated, like "fairy tale castles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/mirages/mirintro.html|title=An Introduction to Mirages|author=A. Young}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rainbow]]s are the result of a combination of internal reflection and dispersive refraction of light in raindrops.  Because rainbows are seen on the opposite side of the sky as the sun, rainbows are more prominent the closer the sun is to the horizon due to their greater distance apart.&lt;ref name=light&gt;{{cite book|title=University Physics 8e|author=H.

==Sun and Moon size==
[[File:Moon size illusion.png|right|250px|thumb|Comparison between the relative sizes of the Moon and a cloud at different points in the sky]]
{{Main|Moon illusion}}

In the [[Book of Optics]] (1011–22 AD), [[Ibn al-Haytham]] argued that vision occurs in the brain, and that personal experience has an effect on what people see and how they see, and that vision and perception are subjective. Arguing against [[Ptolemy]]'s refraction theory for why people perceive the Sun and [[Moon]] larger at the [[horizon]] than when they are higher in the sky, he redefined the problem in terms of perceived, rather than real, enlargement. He said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer. With the Moon, however, there are no intervening objects. Therefore, since the size of an object depends on its observed distance, which is in this case inaccurate, the Moon appears larger on the horizon. Through works by [[Roger Bacon]], [[John Pecham]] and [[Witelo]] based on Ibn al-Haytham's explanation, the Moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon, with Ptolemy's theory being rejected in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Hershenson&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x1qcL4CTwlIC|title=The Moon illusion|author=Maurice Hershenson|year=1989|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-8058-0121-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For over 100 years, research on the Moon illusion has been conducted by vision scientists who invariably have been psychologists specializing in human [[perception]]. After reviewing the many different explanations in their 2002 book ''The Mystery of the Moon Illusion'', Ross and Plug conclude "No single theory has emerged victorious".&lt;ref&gt;Helen Ross, Cornelis Plug (2002).

==Sky coloration==
{{Main|Diffuse sky radiation}}
[[File:Skyshot.jpg|thumb|200px|right|When seen from a high [[altitude]], as here from an [[airplane]], the sky's color varies from pale to dark at elevations toward the [[zenith]].]]

[[diffuse sky radiation|Light from the sky]] is a result of the [[Rayleigh scattering]] of [[sunlight]], which results in a blue [[color]] perceived by the human eye. On a sunny day, Rayleigh scattering gives the sky a blue [[image gradient|gradient]], where it is darkest around the [[zenith]] and bright near the horizon. Light rays incoming from overhead encounters {{frac|1|38}} of the [[air mass (astronomy)|air mass]] that those coming along a horizontal path encounter. Hence, fewer particles scatter the zenithal sunbeam, and thus the light remains a darker blue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weatherquesting.com/bluer-on-top.htm Why is the sky bluer on top than at the horizon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422225321/http://weatherquesting.com/bluer-on-top.htm |date=April 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The blueness is at the horizon because the blue light coming from great distances is also preferentially scattered. This results in a red shift of the distant light sources that is compensated by the blue hue of the scattered light in the line of sight. In other words, the red light scatters also; if it does so at a point a great distance from the observer it has a much higher chance of reaching the observer than blue light. At distances nearing infinity, the scattered light is therefore white. Distant clouds or snowy mountaintops will seem yellow for that reason;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Abp5FdhskAC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=distant+clouds+snow+covered+mountains+appear+yellow+book#v=onepage&amp;q=distant%20clouds%20snow%20covered%20mountains%20appear%20yellow%20book&amp;f=false|title=Color and light in nature|author=David K.

The scattering due to [[molecule]] sized particles (as in air) is greater in the forward and backward directions than it is in the lateral direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2x4CAQMEKigC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=molecular+scattering+aerosol+in+atmosphere#v=onepage&amp;q=molecular%20scattering%20aerosol%20in%20atmosphere&amp;f=false|title=Theoretical Fundamentals of Atmospheric Optics|author=Yu Timofeev and A.

If a cloud is thick enough, scattering from multiple water droplets will wash out the set of colored rings and create a washed out white color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Yi8r4qgMV4C&amp;pg=PA427&amp;dq=water+droplet+scattering+light+atmosphere#v=onepage&amp;q=water%20droplet%20scattering%20light%20atmosphere&amp;f=false|title=Fundamentals of atmospheric radiation: an introduction with 400 problems|author=Craig F.

Its presence negatively impacts [[air quality]] during the summer since it adds to the count of airborne particulates.&lt;ref name="pooraq"&gt;Science Daily.

The sky can turn a multitude of colors such as red, orange, pink and yellow (especially near sunset or sunrise) and black at [[night]].  Scattering effects also partially [[Polarization (waves)|polarize]] light from the sky, most pronounced at an angle 90° from the sun.

Sky [[luminance]] distribution models have been recommended by the [[International Commission on Illumination]] (CIE) for the design of [[daylighting]] schemes. Recent developments relate to “all sky models” for modelling sky [[luminance]] under [[weather]] conditions ranging from clear sky to [[overcast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esim.ca/2002/documents/Proceedings/other2.pdf eSim 2008 (May 20th – 22nd, 2008) General Sky Standard Defining Luminance Distributions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422222513/http://www.esim.ca/2002/documents/Proceedings/other2.pdf |date=April 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cloud coloration ==
{{See also|Cloud}}

[[File:Red Color in Gray Clouds.JPG|thumb|250px|Sunset reflecting shades of pink onto grey stratocumulus clouds.]]
The color of a cloud, as seen from the Earth, tells much about what is going on inside the cloud.  Dense deep tropospheric clouds exhibit a high reflectance (70% to 95%) throughout the [[visible spectrum]]. Tiny particles of water are densely packed and sunlight cannot penetrate far into the cloud before it is reflected out, giving a cloud its characteristic white color, especially when viewed from the top.&lt;ref name="Steven Salter and John Latham"&gt;[http://www.21stcenturychallenges.org/60-seconds/increasing-cloud-reflectivity "Increasing Cloud Reflectivity"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402113744/http://www.21stcenturychallenges.org/60-seconds/increasing-cloud-reflectivity |date=April 2, 2015 }}, Royal Geographical Society, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Cloud droplets tend to scatter light efficiently, so that the intensity of the [[solar radiation]] decreases with depth into the gases.  As a result, the [[cloud base]] can vary from a very light to very dark grey depending on the cloud's thickness and how much [[light]] is being reflected or transmitted back to the observer.  Thin clouds may look white or appear to have acquired the color of their [[Natural environment|environment]] or background.  High tropospheric and non-tropospheric clouds appear mostly white if composed entirely of ice crystals and/or supercooled water droplets.

As a tropospheric cloud matures, the dense water droplets may combine to produce larger droplets, which may combine to form droplets large enough to fall as [[rain]]. By this process of accumulation, the space between droplets becomes increasingly larger, permitting light to penetrate farther into the cloud. If the cloud is sufficiently large and the droplets within are spaced far enough apart, it may be that a percentage of the light which enters the cloud is not reflected back out before it is absorbed. A simple example of this is being able to see farther in heavy rain than in heavy fog. This process of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]]/[[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] is what causes the range of cloud color from white to black.&lt;ref name="Bette Hileman"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Clouds absorb more solar radiation than previously thought |journal= Chem. Eng. News|year= 1995|page= 33|doi=10.1021/cen-v073n007.p033|author=Bette Hileman|volume= 73 |issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other colors occur naturally in clouds. Bluish-grey is the result of light scattering within the cloud. In the visible spectrum, blue and green are at the short end of light's visible wavelengths, while red and yellow are at the long end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science-edu.larc.nasa.gov/EDDOCS/Wavelengths_for_Colors.html|title=What Wavelength Goes With a Color?|author=Atmospheric Science Data Center|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|date=2007-09-28|accessdate=2011-03-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720105431/http://science-edu.larc.nasa.gov/EDDOCS/Wavelengths_for_Colors.html|archive-date=2011-07-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The short rays are more easily scattered by water droplets, and the long rays are more likely to be absorbed.  The bluish color is evidence that such scattering is being produced by rain-sized droplets in the cloud. A cumulonimbus cloud emitting green is a sign that it is a [[Thunderstorm#Severe thunderstorms|severe thunderstorm]],&lt;ref name="frank"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology|doi=10.1175/1520-0450-39.10.1754|pages=1754–1757|author=Frank W. Gallagher, III.|issue=10|title=Distant Green Thunderstorms – Frazer's Theory Revisited|volume=39|date=October 2000|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|bibcode = 2000JApMe..39.1754G }}&lt;/ref&gt; capable of heavy rain, [[hail]], strong [[wind]]s and possible [[tornado]]es. The exact cause of green thunderstorms is still unknown, but it could be due to the combination of reddened sunlight passing through very optically thick clouds. Yellowish clouds may occur in the late spring through early fall months during [[Wildfire|forest fire]] season. The yellow color is due to the presence of pollutants in the smoke.  Yellowish clouds caused by the presence of nitrogen dioxide are sometimes seen in urban areas with high air pollution levels.&lt;ref name="Garrett Nagle"&gt;{{cite book|author=Garrett Nagle|title=Hazards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qC1l1RdWpIwC&amp;pg=PA101|year=1998|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-17-490022-1|pages=101–|chapter=10. Cities and Air Pollution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red, orange and pink clouds occur almost entirely at sunrise and sunset and are the result of the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere.  When the angle between the sun and the horizon is less than 10&amp;nbsp;percent, as it is just after sunrise or just prior to sunset, sunlight becomes too red due to refraction for any colors other than those with a reddish hue to be seen.&lt;ref name="frank"/&gt;  The clouds do not become that color; they are reflecting long and unscattered rays of sunlight, which are predominant at those hours. The effect is much like if one were to shine a red spotlight on a white sheet. In combination with large, mature thunderheads this can produce blood-red clouds.  Clouds look darker in the near-[[infrared]] because water absorbs solar radiation at those [[wavelengths]].

==Halos==
{{Main|Halo (optical phenomenon)}}
[[File:Sun halo optical phenomenon edit.jpg|thumb|A man in front of a complex halo display at the [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]].]]
A halo (ἅλως; also known as a nimbus, icebow or gloriole) is an [[optical phenomenon]] produced by the interaction of light from the sun or moon with ice crystals in the atmosphere, resulting in colored or white arcs, rings or spots in the sky.&lt;ref name="1842diction"/&gt; Many halos are positioned near the sun or moon, but others are elsewhere and even in the opposite part of the sky. They can also form around artificial lights in very cold weather when ice crystals called [[diamond dust]] are floating in the nearby air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BR2ft4G5TgQC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=halo+caused+by+diamond+dust+book#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The weather identification handbook|author=Storm Dunlop|page=118|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=978-1-58574-857-0|year=2003|accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many types of ice halos.

===Sun dogs===
[[File:Fargo Sundogs 2 18 09.jpg|thumb|Very bright sundogs in [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]], [[North Dakota]]. Note the halo arcs passing through each sun dog.]]
{{Main|Sun dogs}}
Sun dogs are a common type of halo, with the appearance of two subtly-colored bright spots to the left and right of the sun, at a distance of about 22° and at the same elevation above the horizon. They are commonly caused by plate-shaped [[hexagonal]] [[ice crystal]]s.&lt;ref name="Grenci"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FunOpt"/&gt;  These crystals tend to become horizontally aligned as they sink through the air, causing them to refract the sunlight to the left and right, resulting in the two sun dogs.&lt;ref name="FunOpt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grenci"/&gt;

As the sun rises higher, the rays passing through the crystals are increasingly skewed from the horizontal plane. Their angle of deviation increases and the sundogs move further from the sun.&lt;ref name="atoptics-sunalt"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/dogalt.htm | title = Effect of solar altitude | publisher = Atmospheric Optics | accessdate = 2011-04-02 | author = Les Cowley|date=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, they always stay at the same elevation as the sun.  Sun dogs are red-colored at the side nearest the sun.  Farther out the colors grade to blue or violet.&lt;ref name="Grenci"/&gt;  However, the colors overlap considerably and so are muted, rarely pure or saturated.  The colors of the sun dog finally merge into the white of the [[parhelic circle]] (if the latter is visible).

It is theoretically possible to predict the forms of sun dogs as would be seen on other planets and moons. [[Mars]] might have sundogs formed by both water-ice and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ice.  On the giant gas planets — [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]] — other crystals form the clouds of [[ammonia]], [[methane]], and other substances that can produce halos with four or more sundogs.&lt;ref name="atoptics-other-worlds"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/oworld.htm | title = Other Worlds | publisher = Atmospheric Optics | accessdate = 2011-04-01|date=2009-08-02 | author = Les Cowley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glory==
[[File:Solar glory at the steam from hot spring.jpg|Solar glory at the steam from a [[hot spring]]|thumb|right]]

{{Main|Glory (optical phenomenon)}}
A common optical phenomenon involving water droplets is the glory.&lt;ref name="1842diction"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5To-AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA540&amp;lpg=PA540&amp;dq=halo+formation+ice+atmosphere+book#v=onepage&amp;q=halo%20formation%20ice%20atmosphere%20book&amp;f=false|title=A dictionary of science, literature, &amp; art: comprising the history, description, and all the terms in general use|page=540|author=William Thomas Brande and Joseph Cauvin|year=1842|accessdate=2011-04-02|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A glory is an optical phenomenon, appearing much like an iconic [[Saint]]'s [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] about the head of the observer, produced by light [[backscatter]]ed (a combination of [[diffraction]], [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]]) towards its source by a cloud of uniformly sized water droplets. A glory has multiple colored rings, with red colors on the outermost ring and blue/violet colors on the innermost ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=g|title=Glossary: G|author=[[National Weather Service]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=2009-06-25|accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The angular distance is much smaller than a rainbow, ranging between 5° and 20°, depending on the size of the droplets. The glory can only be seen when the observer is directly between the sun and cloud of refracting water droplets. Hence, it is commonly observed while airborne, with the glory surrounding the airplane's shadow on clouds (this is often called ''The Glory of the Pilot'').  Glories can also be seen from mountains and tall buildings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S96s2HD0FJgC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=angle+size+glory+book#v=onepage&amp;q=angle%20size%20glory%20book&amp;f=false|page=70|title=Science From Your Airplane Window|author=Elizabeth A. Wood|year=1975|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-23205-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; when there are clouds or fog below the level of the observer, or on days with ground fog.  The glory is related to the optical phenomenon [[anthelion]].

==Rainbow==
{{Main|Rainbow}}
[[File:Double-alaskan-rainbow.jpg|thumb|right|Double rainbow and supernumerary rainbows on the inside of the primary arc. The shadow of the photographer's head marks the centre of the rainbow circle ([[antisolar point]]).]]
A rainbow is an [[optics|optical]] and [[meteorology|meteorological]] phenomenon that causes a [[optical spectrum|spectrum]] of light to appear in the sky when the Sun shines on to droplets of moisture in the Earth's atmosphere. It takes the form of a multicolored [[arc (geometry)|arc]].  Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the sun, but originate no further than 42&amp;nbsp;degrees above the horizon for observers on the ground.  To see them at higher angles, an observer would need to be in an airplane or near a mountaintop since the rainbow would otherwise be below the horizon.  The bigger the droplets which formed the rainbow, the brighter it will be.  Rainbows are most common near afternoon [[thunderstorm]]s during the [[summer]].&lt;ref name="mac"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M6MJAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA489&amp;dq=rainbow+formation+colors+book#v=onepage&amp;q=rainbow%20formation%20colors%20book&amp;f=false|pages=449–450|title=Meteorology: a text-book on the weather, the causes of its changes, and weather forecasting, for the student and general reader|author=Willis Isbister Milham|year=1912|accessdate=2011-04-02|publisher=The Macmillan Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single reflection off the backs of an array of raindrops produces a rainbow with an angular size on the sky that ranges from 40° to 42° with red on the outside. Double rainbows are produced by two internal reflections with angular size of 50.5° to 54° with violet on the outside.  Within the "primary rainbow" (the lowest, and also normally the brightest rainbow) the arc of a rainbow shows red on the outer (or upper) part of the arc, and violet on the inner section. This rainbow is caused by light being reflected once in droplets of water.  In a double rainbow, a second arc may be seen above and outside the primary arc, and has the order of its colors reversed (red faces inward toward the other rainbow, in both rainbows). This second rainbow is caused by light reflecting twice inside water droplets.&lt;ref name="mac"/&gt; The region between a double rainbow is dark. The reason for this dark band is that, while light ''below'' the primary rainbow comes from droplet reflection, and light ''above'' the upper (secondary) rainbow also comes from droplet reflection, there is no mechanism for the region ''between'' a double rainbow to show any light reflected from water drops, at all.

A rainbow spans a continuous spectrum of colors; the distinct bands (including the number of bands) are an artifact of human [[color vision]], and no banding of any type is seen in a [[black-and-white]] [[photograph]] of a rainbow (only a smooth gradation of intensity to a maxima, then fading to a minima at the other side of the arc).  For colors seen by a normal human eye, the most commonly cited and remembered sequence, in English, is [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] sevenfold red, orange, yellow, green, blue, [[indigo]] and violet (popularly memorized by [[Roy G. Biv|mnemonics like Roy G. Biv]]).&lt;ref name="back"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Sky|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=494DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA58&amp;dq=rainbow+colors+roy+g.+biv+book#v=onepage&amp;q=rainbow%20colors%20roy%20g.%20biv%20book&amp;f=false|journal=Backpacker|date=October 1995|pages=55–59|author=Jeff Rennicke|volume=23|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[color blindness|color-blind]] persons will see fewer colors.

Rainbows can be caused by many forms of airborne water. These include not only rain, but also mist, spray, and airborne [[dew]].

==Mirage==
{{Main|Green flash|Mirage}}
[[File:Farallon Islands at inferior mirage no mirage and superior mirage.jpg|thumb|350px|Various kinds of mirages in one location taken over the course of six minutes. The uppermost inset frame shows an inferior mirage of the [[Farallon Islands]]. The second inset frame shows a [[green flash]] on the left-hand side. The two lower frames and the main frame all show [[superior mirage]]s of the Farallon Islands. In these three frames, the superior mirage evolves from a 3-image mirage to a 5-image mirage, and back to a 2-image mirage. Such a display is consistent with a [[Fata Morgana (mirage)|Fata Morgana]].]] 
A [[mirage]] is a naturally occurring optical phenomenon in which light rays are bent to produce a displaced image of distant objects or the sky. The word comes to English via the [[French language|French]] ''mirage'', from the [[Latin]] ''mirare'', meaning "to look at, to wonder at". This is the same root as for "mirror" and "to admire". Also, it has its roots in the [[Arabic]] ''mirage''.

In contrast to a [[hallucination]], a mirage is a real optical phenomenon which can be captured on camera, since light rays actually are refracted to form the false image at the observer's location. What the image appears to represent, however, is determined by the interpretive faculties of the human mind. For example, inferior images on land are very easily mistaken for the reflections from a small body of water.

Mirages can be categorized as "inferior" (meaning lower), "superior" (meaning higher) and "[[Fata Morgana (mirage)|Fata Morgana]]", one kind of superior mirage consisting of a series of unusually elaborate, vertically stacked images, which form one rapidly changing mirage.

[[Green flash]]es and green rays are optical phenomena that occur shortly after sunset or before sunrise, when a [[green]] spot is visible, usually for no more than a second or two, above the sun, or a green ray shoots up from the sunset point. Green flashes are actually a group of phenomena stemming from different causes, and some are more common than others.&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite news | author=Andrew T. Young | url=http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/papers/Zenit/glance.html | title=Green flashes at a glance | year=2006 | publisher=[[San Diego State University]] | accessdate=2009-03-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090205040740/http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/papers/Zenit/glance.html| archivedate= 5 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Green flashes can be observed from any [[altitude]] (even from an aircraft). They are usually seen at an unobstructed [[horizon]], such as over the [[ocean]], but are possible over cloud tops and mountain tops as well.

A green flash from the moon and bright planets at the horizon, including [[Venus]] and [[Jupiter]], can also be observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=C. R.

===Fata Morgana===
[[File:Fata morgana of a boat 2.jpg|thumb|right|A Fata Morgana of a boat]]
{{Main|Fata Morgana (mirage)}}
This optical phenomenon occurs because rays of light are strongly bent when they pass through air layers of different temperatures in a steep [[temperature inversion|thermal inversion]] where an [[atmospheric duct]] has formed.&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Mirages"/&gt;  A thermal inversion is an atmospheric condition where warmer air exists in a well-defined layer above a layer of significantly cooler air.  This temperature inversion is the opposite of what is normally the case; air is usually warmer close to the surface, and cooler higher up.  In calm weather, a layer of significantly warmer air can rest over colder dense air, forming an atmospheric duct which acts like a refracting [[lens (optics)|lens]], producing a series of both inverted and erect images.

A Fata Morgana is an unusual and very complex form of mirage, a form of [[Mirage#Superior mirage|superior mirage]], which, like many other kinds of superior mirages, is seen in a narrow band right above the horizon. It is an [[Italian language|Italian]] phrase derived from the vulgar Latin for "fairy" and the Arthurian sorcerer [[Morgan le Fay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KJtQptBcZloC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Fata+Morgana+mirage+naming#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A Dictionary of Hallucinations|author=Jan Dirk Blom|page=189|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-1222-0|accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; from a belief that the mirage, often seen in the [[Strait of Messina]], were fairy castles in the air,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTlOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA372&amp;dq=Fata+Morgana+mirage+naming#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|journal=Monthly Weather Review|volume=24|issue=10|page=372|date=October 1896|accessdate=2011-04-02|title=Atmospheric Refractions at the Surface of Water|author=[[Cleveland Abbe]]|publisher=[[United States Weather Bureau]]|bibcode=  1896MWRv...24R.371.|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1896)24[371b:ARATSO]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or false land designed to lure sailors to their death created by her witchcraft. Although the term Fata Morgana is sometimes incorrectly applied to other, more common kinds of mirages, the true Fata Morgana is not the same as an ordinary superior mirage, and is certainly not the same as an [[Mirage#Inferior mirage|inferior mirage]].

Fata Morgana mirages tremendously distort the object or objects which they are based on, such that the object often appears to be very unusual, and may even be transformed in such a way that it is completely unrecognizable. A Fata Morgana can be seen on land or at sea, in polar regions or in deserts. This kind of mirage can involve almost any kind of distant object, including such things as boats, islands, and coastline.

A Fata Morgana is not only complex, but also rapidly changing. The mirage comprises several inverted (upside down) and erect (right side up) images that are stacked on top of one another. Fata Morgana mirages also show alternating compressed and stretched zones.&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Mirages"&gt;[http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/mirages/mirintro.html An Introduction to Mirages] by Andy Young&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novaya Zemlya effect===
{{Main|Novaya Zemlya effect}}
The [[Novaya Zemlya effect]] is a [[Polar climate|polar]] mirage caused by high refraction of sunlight between atmospheric [[thermocline]]s. The Novaya Zemlya effect will give the impression that the sun is rising earlier or setting later than it actually should (astronomically speaking).&lt;ref name="nov"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZrzmGHinaZQC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=Novaya+Zemlya+effect+sun#v=onepage&amp;q=Novaya%20Zemlya%20effect%20sun&amp;f=false|page=149|title=Climate and glacial history of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, Russian Arctic: with notes on the region's history of exploration|author=JaapJan Zeeberg|publisher=JaapJan Zeeberg|year=2001|accessdate=2011-04-02|isbn=978-90-5170-563-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Depending on the [[meteorology|meteorological]] situation the effect will present the sun as a line or a square (which is sometimes referred to as the "rectangular sun"), made up of flattened hourglass shapes. The mirage requires rays of sunlight to have an [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion layer]] for hundreds of kilometres, and depends on the inversion layer's [[temperature gradient]]. The sunlight must bend to the Earth's curvature at least {{convert|400|km|mi}} to allow an elevation rise of 5&amp;nbsp;degrees for sight of the sun disk.

The first person to record the phenomenon was [[Gerrit de Veer]], a member of [[Willem Barentsz]]' ill-fated third expedition into the polar region. [[Novaya Zemlya]], the archipelago where de Veer first observed the phenomenon, lends its name to the effect.&lt;ref name="nov"/&gt;

==Crepuscular rays==
[[File:Crepuscular rays at Sunset near Waterberg Plateau edit.jpg|thumb|300px|Crepuscular rays, taken near Waterberg Plateau, Namibia]]
{{Main|Crepuscular rays}}
[[Crepuscular ray]]s are near-parallel rays of sunlight moving through the Earth's atmosphere, but appear to diverge because of [[linear perspective]].&lt;ref name="cresp"&gt;{{cite book|pages=124–127|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0cpQGHqxQBUC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=crepuscular+rays+book#v=onepage&amp;q=crepuscular%20rays%20book&amp;f=false|author=John A. Day|title=The Book of Clouds|year=2005|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4027-2813-6|accessdate=2010-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They often occur when objects such as mountain peaks or clouds partially shadow the sun's rays like a [[cloud cover]].  Various airborne compounds scatter the sunlight and make these rays visible, due to [[diffraction]], reflection, and scattering.

Crepuscular rays can also occasionally be viewed underwater, particularly in arctic areas, appearing from ice shelves or cracks in the ice. Also they are also viewed in days when the sun hits the clouds in a perfect angle shining upon the area.

There are three primary forms of crepuscular rays{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}:

*Rays of light penetrating holes in low clouds (also called "[[Jacob's Ladder (disambiguation)|Jacob's Ladder]]").
*Beams of light diverging from behind a cloud.
*Pale, pinkish or reddish rays that radiate from below the horizon.  These are often mistaken for [[light pillar]]s.
They are commonly seen near sunrise and sunset, when tall clouds such as [[cumulonimbus]] and mountains can be most effective at creating these rays.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Anticrepuscular rays===
{{Main|Anticrepuscular rays}}

Anticrepuscular rays while parallel in reality are sometimes visible in the sky in the direction opposite the sun. They appear to converge again at the distant horizon.

==Atmospheric refraction==
[[Image:Refracción.png|thumb|Diagram showing displacement of the [[Sun]]'s image at sunrise and sunset]]
{{Main|Atmospheric refraction}}

[[Atmospheric refraction]] influences the apparent position of astronomical and terrestrial objects, usually causing them to appear higher than they actually are. For this reason navigators, astronomers, and surveyors observe positions when these effects are minimal.  Sailors will only shoot a star when 20° or more above the horizon, astronomers try to schedule observations when an object is highest in the sky, and surveyors try to observe in the afternoon when refraction is minimum.

'''''BRAC Onnesha''''' is the first [[nanosatellite]] built in Bangladesh to be launched into space. The satellite was designed and built in conjunction with [[Kyushu Institute of Technology]]{{'s}} [[Birds-1]] program, which has the goal of helping countries build their first satellite. It was designed and built over a two year period.

The satellite has imaging capabilities and can transmit songs to Earth that are uploaded to its memory. It was launched on a [[Falcon 9]] rocket to the [[International Space Station]] on 3 June 2017, after which it was released from the [[Kibo (ISS module)|''Kibō'' module]]. The satellite completes an orbit once every 90 minutes.

==Background==
Japan supports non-spacefaring countries to build their first satellite through a program called The Joint Global Multi-Nation Birds Satellite project (BIRDS). Besides Japan, four countries participated in the [[Birds-1]] program: Ghana, Mongolia, Nigeria, and Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="gunter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/bird.htm |title=Bird B, BTN, G, J, M, MYS, N, PHL (BRAC Onnesha, GhanaSat 1, Toki, Mazaalai, Nigeria EduSat 1) |publisher=Gunter's Space Page |access-date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five satellites were identical in their design.&lt;ref name="News Ghana"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newsghana.com.gh/mongolia-to-send-first-satellite-off-to-space-on-june-4/ |title=Mongolia to send first satellite off to space on June 4 |work=News Ghana |date=5 June 2017 |accessdate=8 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629044626/https://www.newsghana.com.gh/mongolia-to-send-first-satellite-off-to-space-on-june-4/ |archivedate=29 June 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The idea to develop a satellite was conceived in 2013. On 15 June 2016, Syed Saad Andaleeb, Vice Chancellor at [[BRAC University]], signed a contract with the [[Kyushu Institute of Technology]] (Kyutech), Japan, on behalf of BRAC University. This led to the collaborative building of the first experimental university-made nano-satellite of [[Bangladesh]], designed, developed and assembled by three Bangladeshi students at the Kyushu Institute of Technology. On 8 February 2017, Andaleeb received ''BRAC Onnesha'' from Kyutech's President Yuji Oie and Mengu Cho, Kyutech's Director of the Laboratory of Spacecraft Environment Interaction Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/country/brac-university-says-hi-first-nano-satellite-1357831 |title=Brac University says 'hi' to first nano-satellite |work=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |date=8 February 2017 |accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BRAC University took up an initiative to start space and remote sensing research in collaboration with Kyutech and the Space Research and Remote Sensing Organization (SPARRSO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.newagebd.net/235830/bangladeshi-nano-satellite-orbit-mid-2017/ |title=Bangladeshi nano satellite to be in orbit mid 2017 |work=[[New Age (Bangladesh)|New Age]] |date=16 June 2017 |accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; BRAC University has built a ground station at its Mohakhali campus to analyse data and photographs sent from space for further research purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bracu.ac.bd/news/ground-station-nation%E2%80%99s-first-nano-satellite-inaugurated-brac-university |title=Ground station for nation's first nano-satellite inaugurated at BRAC University |publisher=BRAC University |date=26 May 2017 |access-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Mengu Cho of Kyutech said, "''BRAC ONNESHA'' was easy to build and affordable and their prime objective was to educate the students so that they could go back to build one completely by themselves, presumably in October 2017."&lt;ref name="tds" /&gt;

The two-year period spanning the development, construction, launch and operation of the satellites engaged three university students from each of the five participating countries. All five satellites had to be identical to each other in the class of a 1U CubeSat.&lt;ref name="Indian Express"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/mongolia-launches-its-first-satellite-to-space-4687089/ |title=Mongolia to send its first satellite to space on June 4 |work=The Indian Express |agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service]] |date=3 June 2017 |accessdate=13 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622071936/http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/mongolia-launches-its-first-satellite-to-space-4687089/ |archivedate=22 June 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite cost about {{US$|500,000}} to manufacture and launch.&lt;ref name="face2face" /&gt;

==Mission==
===Launch===
[[File:Launch of CRS-11 mission.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A white Falcon 9 rocket cuts through the blue sky, with its nine engines producing a bright yellow flame|SpaceX launch of CRS-11 with ''BRAC Onnesha'' onboard]]
[[SpaceX]] launched the satellite on its [[SpaceX CRS-11|CRS-11]] mission to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) on 3 June 2017. The satellite was carried in a [[Dragon (spacecraft)|Dragon spacecraft]] on a [[Falcon 9]] rocket, launched from NASA's [[Kennedy Space Center]] [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Pad 39A]]. This was the 100th launch from Pad 39A and the first time SpaceX reused one of its Dragon capsules.&lt;ref name="sfn20170603" /&gt; Once on the ISS, the satellite was deployed from the Japanese [[Kibo (ISS module)|''Kibō'' module]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iss.jaxa.jp/en/kiboexp/news/170707_cubesat_birds.html |title=Successful deployment of five "BIRDS project" CubeSats from the "Kibo" |date=7 July 2017 |publisher=JAXA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The satellite orbits the Earth at an altitude of approximately {{convert|400|km|miles}} and at an inclination of 51.6 degrees. The satellite travels around the Earth every 92 minutes at a velocity of {{convert|7.67|km/s|mph}}&lt;ref name="gna"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghananewsagency.org/science/president-akufo-addo-congratulates-all-nations-university-for-ghanasat-1-satellite-119346 |title=President Akufo-Addo congratulates All Nations University for Ghanasat-1 Satellite |agency=Ghana News Agency |date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="face2face"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://face2faceafrica.com/article/ghanasat-1 |title=Ghanaian Engineers Launch Ghanasat-1, Join Space Race |access-date=24 July 2017 |publisher=Face2Face Africa |last1=Babatunde |first1=Mark |date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operations===
The satellite communicates with seven ground stations: one in each of the countries participating in the Birds-1 program, and one each in Thailand and Taiwan.&lt;ref name="gunter" /&gt; Bangladesh's ground station, inaugurated 25 May 2017, is on the top of a building at BRAC University.&lt;ref name="tds"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/country/bangladesh-first-nano-satellite-brac-university-brac-onnesha-launched-space-1415347 |access-date=28 July 2017 |publisher=The Daily Star |title=Bangladesh's first nano-satellite Brac Onnesha launched into space |date=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''BRAC Onnesha'' is a nanosatellite shaped as a {{convert|10|cm|in}} cube capable of completing one orbit {{convert|400|km|mi}} above the ground in 90 minutes and passing over Bangladesh four to six times a day. The primary objective of the satellite is to image vegetation, urbanization, flood, water resources, and forestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/first-nanosatellite-ready-launch-1358035 |title=First nanosatellite ready for launch |work=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |date=9 February 2017 |accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bessang Pass Monument.jpg|thumb|Bessang Pass Monument]]
==Description==
Bessang Pass lies along Route 4, which is now known as the [[Tagudin–Cervantes–Sabangan Road]] (N205) in the [[barangay]] of Malaya.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, R.R., 2005, Triumph in the Philippines, Honolulu: University Press of the Pacific, {{ISBN|1410224953}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|549}} The pass lies on the southeast side of Langiatan Hill, which reaches a height of {{convert|4000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;{{rp|550}}  South of the pass, Mount Namogoian rises to {{convert|6830|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;{{rp|550}}  East of Langiatan Hill is Magun Hill at {{convert|4500|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;{{rp|550}}

The park contains pine forests as well as mossy type forests. It is crossed by the Bessang Creek and Matukbo River which provides the water supply for Cervantes and other surrounding communities.&lt;ref name="senate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/lisdata/97418275!.pdf |title=Senate Bill No. 2143 |publisher=[[Senate of the Philippines]] |accessdate=8 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924100618/http://www.senate.gov.ph/lisdata/97418275%21.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The park is also the habitat of 29 bird species, 5 mammals, and reptiles such as the [[monitor lizard]] and different species of snakes.&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt;

'''Charles Wilkes''' (April 3, 1798 &amp;ndash; February 8, 1877) was an [[United States|American]] naval officer, ship's captain, and [[List of explorers|explorer]]. He led the [[United States Exploring Expedition, 1838-1842]] and commanded the ship in the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]] during the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), where he attacked a [[Royal Mail Ship]], almost leading to war between the US and the UK. His behavior led to two convictions by court-martial, one stemming from the massacre of almost 80 [[Fiji]]ans on [[Malolo]] in 1840.

==Early life and career==
Wilkes was born in [[New York City]], on April 3, 1798, as the great nephew of the former [[Lord Mayor of London]] [[John Wilkes]]. His mother was Mary Seton, who died in 1802 when Charles was just three years old. As a result, Charles was raised by his aunt, [[Elizabeth Ann Seton]], who would later convert to Roman Catholicism and become the first American-born woman canonized a saint by the Catholic Church. When Elizabeth was left widowed with five children, Charles was sent to a [[boarding school]], and later attended [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]], which is the present-day [[Columbia University]]. He entered the [[United States Navy]] as a [[midshipman]] in 1818, and became a [[lieutenant]] in 1826.

In 1833, for his survey of [[Narragansett Bay]], he was placed in charge of the Navy's Department of Charts and Instruments, out of which developed the [[United States Naval Observatory|Naval Observatory]] and Hydrographic Office. Wilkes' interdisciplinary expedition (1838–1842) set a [[physical oceanography]] benchmark for the office's first superintendent [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]].

==Columbian Institute==

During the 1820s, Wilkes was a member of the prestigious [[Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences]], which counted among its members presidents [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[John Quincy Adams]] and many prominent men of the day, including well-known representatives of the military, government service, medical and other professions.&lt;ref name="rathbun"&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MY-5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=%22columbian+institute%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22columbian%20institute%22&amp;f=false |title=The Columbian institute for the promotion of arts and sciences: A Washington Society of 1816–1838. |first=Richard |last=Rathbun |accessdate=2010-06-20 |work= |publisher=Bulletin of the United States National Museum |date=October 18, 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Seas expedition==
[[File:Vincennes (color).jpg|thumb|{{USS|Vincennes|1826-1867|6}} in Disappointment Bay, Antarctica, during the Wilkes expedition.]]
[[File:Commodore Charles Wilkes, commander of the United States Exploring Expedition 1838 - 1842.jpg|thumb|left|Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, commander of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] 1838 - 1842]]

In 1838, although not yet a seasoned naval line officer, Wilkes was experienced in nautical survey work, and was working with civilian scientists. Upon this background, he was given command of the government exploring expedition "... for the purpose of exploring and surveying the Southern Ocean,... as well to determine the existence of all doubtful islands and shoals, as to discover, and accurately fix, the position of those which [lay] in or near the track of our vessels in that quarter, and [might] have escaped the observation of scientific navigators." The US Exploring Squadron was authorized by act of the [[United States Congress|Congress]] on May 18, 1836.

The Exploring Expedition, commonly known as the "Wilkes Expedition," included [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[botanist]]s, a [[mineralogist]], [[taxidermist]]s, [[artist]]s and a [[philologist]], and it was carried by {{USS|Vincennes|1826-1867|6}} (780 tons) and {{USS|Peacock|1828|6}} (650 tons), the [[brig]] {{USS|Porpoise|1836|6}} (230 tons), the store-ship {{USS|Relief|1836|6}}, and two [[schooner]]s, {{USS|Sea Gull|1838|6}} (110 tons) and {{USS|Flying Fish|1838|6}} (96 tons).&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, David B (1968) ''The Wilkes Expedition. The First United States Exploring Expedition'' (1838–42). Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

Departing from [[Hampton Roads]] on August 18, 1838, the expedition stopped at the [[Madeira Islands]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]; visited [[Tierra del Fuego]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]], the [[Tuamotu]] Archipelago, [[Samoa]], and [[New South Wales]]; from [[Sydney]], Australia sailed into the [[Antarctic Ocean]] in December 1839 and reported the discovery "of an Antarctic continent west of the [[Balleny Islands]]" of which it sighted the coast on January 25, 1840. Next the expedition visited [[Fiji]] and the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. In Fiji, the expedition kidnapped the chief Ro Veidovi, charging him with the murder of a crew of American whalers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Antony|date=2014-07-03|title=The Capture and Curation of the Cannibal 'Vendovi': Reality and Representation of a Pacific Frontier|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00223344.2014.914623|journal=The Journal of Pacific History|volume=49|issue=3|pages=255–282|doi=10.1080/00223344.2014.914623|issn=0022-3344}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, in July 1840, two sailors, one of whom was Wilkes' nephew, Midshipman Wilkes Henry, were killed while bartering for food on [[Fiji]]'s [[Malolo|Malolo Island]]. Wilkes' retribution was swift and severe. According to an old man of Malolo Island, nearly 80 Fijians were killed in the incident.

From December 1840 to March 1841, he employed hundreds of [[native Hawaiian]] porters and many of his men to haul a [[pendulum]] to the summit of [[Mauna Loa]] to measure gravity. Instead of using the existing trail, he blazed his own way, taking much longer than he anticipated. The conditions on the mountain reminded him of Antarctica. Many of his crew suffered snow blindness, altitude sickness and foot injuries from wearing out their shoes.&lt;ref name="focus"&gt;{{cite web |first=Russell A. |last=Apple |url= {{NRHP url|id=74000295}} |title=Wilkes Campsite Nomination form |work=National Register of Historic Places |publisher=National Park Service |year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He explored the west coast of [[North America]], including the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], [[Puget Sound]], the [[Columbia River]], [[San Francisco Bay]] and the [[Sacramento River]], in 1841.

He held the first [[American Independence Day]] celebration west of the Mississippi River in [[Dupont, Washington]] on July 5, 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Wilkes Expedition and Southern Puget Sound: An 1841 Encounter With Lasting Effects |work= History Homework Helpers |publisher= Dupont Museum |author= Drew W.

P. Putnam|volume=Volume 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Exploring Expedition passed through the [[Tuvalu|Ellice Islands]] and visited [[Funafuti]], [[Nukufetau]] and [[Vaitupu]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;The visit to the Ellice Islands (now known as [[Tuvalu]]) is described in Chapter 2 in volume 5, pp. 35-75, 'Ellice's and Kingsmill's Group' [http://www.sil.si.edu/DigitalCollections/usexex/ sil.si.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition returned by way of the [[Philippines]], the [[Sulu Archipelago]], [[Borneo]], [[Singapore]], [[Polynesia]] and the [[Cape of Good Hope]], reaching New York on June 10, 1842.

After having completely encircled the globe (his was the last all-sail naval mission to do so), Wilkes had logged some 87,000 miles and lost two ships and 28 men. Wilkes was [[court-martial]]led upon his return for the loss of one of his ships on the Columbia River bar, for the regular mistreatment of his subordinate officers, and for excessive punishment of his sailors. A major witness against him was ship doctor [[Charles Guillou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Charles Wilkes |author2= Charles Fleury Guilloû |author3=United States Navy Court-martial |title=The following defense of Lieut. Charles Wilkes: to the charge which he has been tried |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXIjHQAACAAJ |year=1843}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was acquitted on all charges except illegally punishing men in his squadron. For a short time, he was attached to the Coast Survey, but from 1844 to 1861, he was chiefly engaged in preparing the report of the expedition.

His ''Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition'' (5 volumes and an atlas) was published in 1844. He edited the scientific reports of the expedition (19 volumes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hartwell, Mary Ann|title=Checklist of United States public documents 1789–1909|year=1911|page=661|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9OtH6LR6A-oC&amp;pg=PA661}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/usexex/learn/Overstreet-02.pdf The Publications of the U.S. Exploring Expedition, 1844–1874, Smithsonian Institution Libraries Digital Collection — Volumes were numbered I through XXIV. Volumes XVIII, XIX, XXI, &amp; XXII were not published. Only 2 chapters of Volume XXIV were published.]&lt;/ref&gt; and 11 atlases, 1844–1874) and was the author of Vol. XI ([[Meteorology]]) and Vol. XXIII ([[Hydrography]]).
[[Alfred Thomas Agate]], engraver and illustrator, was the designated portrait and botanical artist of the expedition. His work was used to illustrate the ''Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition''.&lt;ref&gt;The extensive report of the expedition has been digitized by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The visit to the Ellice Islands (now known as [[Tuvalu]]) is described in Chapter 2 in volume 5, pp. 35-75, 'Ellice's and Kingsmill's Group', [http://www.sil.si.edu/DigitalCollections/usexex/ sil.si.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Narrative'' contains much interesting material concerning the manners, customs, political and economic conditions in many places then little known. Wilkes' 1841 Map of the [[Oregon Territory]] pre-dated [[John Charles Fremont]]'s first [[Oregon Trail]] pathfinder expedition guided by [[Kit Carson]] during 1842.

Other valuable contributions were the three reports of [[James Dwight Dana]] on ''[[Zoophyte]]s'' (1846), ''[[Geology]]'' (1849) and ''[[Crustacean|Crustacea]]'' (1852–1854). Moreover, the specimens and artifacts brought back by expedition [[scientists]] ultimately formed the foundation for the [[Smithsonian Institution]] collection. In addition to many shorter articles and reports, Wilkes published the major scientific works ''Western America, including California and Oregon'' in 1849, and ''Theory of the Winds'' in 1856.

==Civil War==
[[File:Currier &amp; Ives - The champions of the Union 1861.jpg|thumb|right|Capt. Charles Wilkes in ''The champions of the Union'', lithograph by Currier &amp; Ives, 1861]]
Wilkes was promoted to the rank of commander in 1843 and that of captain in 1855. At the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], he was assigned to the command of {{USS|San Jacinto|1850|6}} to search for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] commerce destroyer {{ship|CSS|Sumter}}.

===''Trent'' Affair===
{{main |Trent Affair}}
As part of these duties he visited the British colony of [[Bermuda]]. Acting on orders, Wilkes remained in port for nearly a week aboard his flagship, {{USS|Wachusett|1861|6}}, violating the British rule that allowed American naval vessels (of either side) to remain in port for only a single day. While Wilkes remained in port, his gunboats {{USS|Tioga|1862|6}} and {{USS|Sonoma|1862|6}} blockaded [[St. George's, Bermuda|Saint George's]] harbor, a key Confederate [[blockade runner]] base. The gunboats opened fire at the [[Royal Mail Ship]] ''Merlin''.

When Wilkes learned that [[James Murray Mason]] and [[John Slidell]], two Confederate commissioners to England, were bound for England on a British [[packet boat]], {{ship|RMS|Trent}}, he ordered the steam frigate ''San Jacinto'' to stop them. On November 8, 1861, ''San Jacinto'' met ''Trent'' and fired two shots across its bow, forcing the ship to stop. A boarding party from ''San Jacinto'' led by its captain then boarded ''Trent'' and arrested Mason and Slidell. The diplomats were taken to [[Fort Warren (Massachusetts)|Fort Warren]] in Boston Harbor.

The actions of "The Notorious Wilkes," as Bermuda media branded him, convinced many that full-scale war between the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] was inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rogues &amp; runners: Bermuda and the American Civil War |page=25 |first=Catherine Lynch |last=Deichmann |publisher=Bermuda National Trust |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-9693939-9-3 |url= https://books.google.com/books?ct=result&amp;id=sjhNAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Notorious+Wilkes%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was officially thanked by Congress "for his brave, adroit and patriotic conduct".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1862|year=1863|publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Company|location=New York|page=276|url=https://archive.org/stream/1862appletonsan02newyuoft#page/n283/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his action was later disavowed by [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] due to diplomatic pressure by the British Government. (Mason and Slidell were released.) His next service was in the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] flotilla and he was placed on the retired list on December 21, 1861. Subsequently, after reaching the rank of commodore on July 16, 1862, he was assigned to duty against blockade runners in the [[West Indies]].

===Promotion controversy===
Wilkes acquired a reputation for sometimes acting arrogant and capriciously, perhaps partly because of his open conflict with [[Gideon Welles]], who was the [[Secretary of the Navy]].
Welles recommended that Wilkes had been too old to receive the rank of commodore under the act then governing promotions. Wilkes wrote a scathing letter to Welles in response. The controversy ended in his court-martial in 1864. He was found guilty of disobedience of orders, insubordination, and other specifications. He was sentenced to public reprimand and suspension for three years. However, Lincoln reduced the suspension to one year, and the balance of charges were dropped. On July 25, 1866, he was promoted to the rank of rear admiral on the retired list.

==Later life==
[[File:Rear Admiral Charles Wilkes.jpg|thumb|Admiral Charles Wilkes when retired]]
Some historians speculate that Wilkes' obsessive behavior and harsh code of shipboard discipline shaped [[Herman Melville]]'s characterization of Captain Ahab in ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Stormy Petrel and the Whale, by David Jaffe, Port City Press, c1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Such speculation is not mentioned in the U.S. Naval historical archives.

In addition to his contribution to U.S. Naval history and scientific study in his official ''Narrative of the Exploration Squadron'' (6 volumes), Wilkes wrote his autobiography.

Wilkes died in [[Washington, DC]], with the rank of Rear Admiral.

In August 1909, the United States moved his remains to [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. His gravestone says that "he discovered the Ant-arctic continent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Charles Wilkes Rear Admiral, United States Navy |work= Arlington Cemetery Biography |url= http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/cwilkes.htm |accessdate= March 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Admiral Charles Wilkes plaque at United States National Arboretum.jpg|thumb|left|Admiral Charles Wilkes plaque at United States National Arboretum]]
The US Navy named four ships for Wilkes: torpedo boat {{USS|Wilkes|TB-35}} served around the turn of the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DANFS |title= USS Wilkes (TB-35) |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/w8/wilkes-i.htm |accessdate= March 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; destroyer {{USS|Wilkes|DD-67}} served during [[World War I]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DANFS |title= USS Wilkes (DD-67) |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/w8/wilkes-ii.htm |accessdate= March 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and destroyer {{USS|Wilkes|DD-441}} served during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DANFS |title= USS Wilkes (DD-441) |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/w8/wilkes-iii.htm |accessdate= March 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
An oceanographic survey vessel, USS ''Wilkes'' (T-AGS-33), was launched in 1969, sponsored by Mrs. Hollis Lyons Joy (Deborah Wilkes Joy), Wilkes' great granddaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DANFS |title= USS Wilkes (T-AGS-33) |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/w8/wilkes-iv.htm |accessdate= March 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Wilkes Island, one of the three islands surrounding the lagoon at [[Wake Island|Wake Atoll]] was named for Wilkes by [[Alexander Wetmore]], lead scientist of the [[Tanager Expedition]].

Captain Charles Wilkes Elementary in [[Bainbridge Island|Bainbridge Island, Washington]] is his namesake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bainbridge Island School District|url=http://www.bisd303.org/Domain/12|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilkes Boulevard in [[Columbia, Missouri]] is named in his honor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1542">The '''CHondritic Uniform Reservoir''' or '''CHUR''' is a scientific model in [[astrophysics]] and [[geochemistry]] for the mean chemical composition of the part of the [[Solar Nebula]] from which, during the formation of the Solar System, [[chondrite]]s formed. This hypothetical chemical reservoir is thought to have been similar in composition to the current [[photosphere]] of the [[Sun]].

When the Sun formed from its [[protostar]], around 4.56 billion years ago, the [[solar wind]] blew all [[gas]] [[wiktionary:Particle|particle]]s from the central part of the Solar Nebula. In this way most lighter [[volatiles]] (e.g. [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], [[oxygen]], [[carbon]] dioxide), that had not yet condensed in the inner, warmer regions of the nebula, were lost. This fractionation process is the reason why the [[terrestrial planet]]s and [[asteroid belt]] are relatively enriched in heavy elements in respect to the Sun or the [[gas planet]]s.

A certain type of meteorites, [[carbonaceous chondrite|CI-chondrites]], have a chemical composition that is almost identical to the solar [[photosphere]], except for the abundances of volatiles. Because the Sun contains 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System, they are considered to have the same composition as the solar nebula with the exception of volatile loss and are therefore representative of the material from which the terrestrial planets, including the Earth, were formed.

It was decreed as a Natural Monument on December 12, 1978 with Decree No. 2989 published in Official Gazette No. 2,417 of March 7, 1979. The monument was named in honor of [[Alfredo Jahn]], pioneer of various scientific disciplines in Venezuela as Geography, geography, topography, astronomy, anthropology, linguistics and botany, and who was also founder of the Venezuelan Society of Natural Sciences.

It is a moist cave, still active, which has been formed by the action of the Cambural Gorge. Its calcite walls are covered with spectacular stalagmites, stalactites and columns, which reach its maximum development in the Hall of the Chaguaramo or Hall of the Rain.

The temperature inside the cave ranges between 22&amp;nbsp;°C and 26&amp;nbsp;°C. The cave is surrounded by a pre-montane seasonal semideciduous forest and presents three dense tree layers.

'''Edwin Way Teale''' (June 2, 1899 &amp;ndash; October 18, 1980) was an [[United States|American]] naturalist, [[photography|photographer]] and writer. Teale's works serve as primary source material documenting environmental conditions across North America from 1930 - 1980. He is perhaps best known for his series ''The American Seasons'', four books documenting over {{convert|75000|mi|km}} of automobile travel across North America following the changing seasons.

== Early years and education ==
Born Edwin Alfred Teale in [[Joliet, Illinois]], to Oliver Cromwell and Clara Louise (Way) Teale, his interest in the natural world was fostered by childhood summers spent at his grandparents' "Lone Oak" farm in [[Indiana]]'s dune country&amp;mdash;experiences recalled in his book ''Dune Boy'' (1943).&lt;ref&gt;Joan Gibb Engel,[http://chicagowildernessmag.org/issues/summer2001/duneboy.html "Dune Boy: Edwin Way Teale, best-selling author of nature books, had roots in the sandy soil of northwest Indiana"], ''Chicago Wilderness Magazine'', Summer 2001, accessed 3/2/2008.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of nine, Teale declared himself a naturalist and at 12 changed his name to Edwin Way Teale.&lt;ref name=dodd&gt;Edward H. Dodd Jr., ''Of Nature, Time and Teale: a biographical sketch of Edwin Way Teale'', 1960, Dodd, Mead, &amp; Company, New York&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p8-9}}

He received a B.A. from [[Earlham College]] in English literature in 1922, then took a job at [[Friends University]] in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[Kansas]]. Teale taught at Friends from 1922–1924 and served as men's and women's debate coach, yearbook adviser and chairman of the campus Peace Contest.&lt;ref&gt;Friends University, "The 1924 Talisman Yearbook", Wichita, Kansas, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 he married Nellie Imogene Donovan, also on the Friends faculty, whom he had met while at Earlham College.&lt;ref name=dodd/&gt;{{rp|p9}}

In 1924, Edwin and Nellie moved to [[New York, New York|New York]] so Edwin could pursue his education at [[Columbia University]]. Teale chose Columbia in part

&lt;blockquote&gt;... because it was in New York and it wouldn't take two months to get a manuscript back from a magazine.&lt;ref name=dodd/&gt;{{rp|p10}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1926 he received his [[Master of Arts]] degree from [[Columbia University]].

== Career ==
[[File:Trail Wood home and lane.jpg|Trail Wood, Teale's home near Hampton, Connecticut, 2004|thumb|225px|right]]
[[File:Trail Wood writing cabin.jpg|Teale's writing cabin at Trail Wood near Hampton, Connecticut, 2004|thumb|225px|right]]
In [[New York (state)|New York]], Teale spent 13 years in his first full-time writing job, as a staff writer for ''[[Popular Science]]'', working on a wide variety of assignments.&lt;ref name=dodd/&gt;{{rp|p11}}
In 1937, Teale's first photographic nature study, ''Grassroots Jungle'', was published from among 200 of Teale's insect photographs, many of which were taken on a {{convert|4|acre|ha|adj=on}} plot of land near his home on Park Avenue in Baldwin, [[Long Island]] &lt;ref name=dodd/&gt;{{rp|p12-17,50}} This was followed, in 1941, by ''The Golden Throng'', a combination of text and photographs on bees.

At the age of 42, Teale left ''Popular Science'' to become a freelance photographer and nature writer.&lt;ref name=dodd/&gt;{{rp|p15}}

In 1942 he wrote ''Byways to Adventure: A Guide to Nature Hobbies'' as well as ''Near Horizons,'' which received the 1943 [[John Burroughs Medal]] for distinguished natural history writing.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Burroughs Association]], [http://research.amnh.org/burroughs/medal_award_list.html, [[John Burroughs Medal]] Award List], accessed 3/2/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1945 Edwin's son David was killed in action in Germany.&lt;ref name=dodd/&gt;{{rp|p19}} The Teales began a series of trips across the country, in part to deal with their grief. That same year, ''Lost Woods'' was published and received positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Babcock, ''Chicago Daily Tribune''. Chicago, Ill.: Nov 25, 1945. p. D11&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 1947,  the Teales set off in their black [[Buick]] for a {{convert|17000|mi|km|adj=on}} roadtrip. They headed first to the Florida [[Everglades]], then zigzagged northward following the advance of spring. Teale wrote about the adventure in ''[[North with the Spring]]''. The book was followed by three others on the North American seasons: ''[[Journey Into Summer]]'', ''[[Autumn Across America]]'', and ''[[Wandering Through Winter]]'', which won the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;The Pulitzer Board, [http://www.pulitzer.org The Pulitzer Prize Winners 1966], accessed 3/2/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Teale served as president of the [[New York Entomological Society]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyentsoc.org/  Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; from 1944-1949 and the [[Brooklyn Entomological Society]] (later incorporated into the New York Entomological Society&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyentsoc.org/nyes1page.htm  Official Website of the New York Entomological Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125025331/http://www.nyentsoc.org/nyes1page.htm |date=2010-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) from 1949-1953.

Teale worked as a co-writer for a segment titled "Vernal Equinox" on the March 20, 1955 episode of ''Omnibus'', a TV-Radio Workshop of the [[Ford Foundation]] produced by [[Robert Saudek]] and hosted by [[Alistair Cooke]] on the [[CBS Television Network]].&lt;ref name="Author Search for Edwin Way Teale"&gt;United States Library of Congress Online Catalog, [https://www.loc.gov, Author Search for Edwin Way Teale], accessed 3/2/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Teale became president of the [[Thoreau Society]] in 1958, the same year that ''Autumn Across America'' was presented to the White House Library. He received an Indiana Author's Day award in 1960 and the Doctor of Humane Letters (LHD) honorary degree from [[Indiana University]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Indiana University, Office of University Ceremonies, [http://www.indiana.edu/~ceremony/honors/honorarydegrees.shtml IU Honorary Degree Recipients], accessed 3/2/2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Earlham College]] honored Teale with an Honorary Doctor of Letters degree.&lt;ref name=dodd/&gt;{{rp|p51}}

In 1959, the Teales left the increasing suburbanization of their [[Long Island]] home for a {{convert|130|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm in [[Hampton, Connecticut]], which they named "Trail Wood," and which Teale chronicled in ''A Naturalist Buys an Old Farm'' (1974). The property was further described in ''A Walk through the Year'' (1978). Situated next to the [[Natchaug State Forest]], Trail Wood is now managed as a nature preserve by the Connecticut [[Audubon Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Connecticut Audubon Society, [http://www.ctaudubon.org/visit/trailwood.htm Center At Trail Wood] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313155122/http://www.ctaudubon.org/visit/trailwood.htm |date=2008-03-13 }}, accessed 3/2/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Teale received the Ecology Award from the [[Massachusetts Horticultural Society]]&lt;ref&gt;The Concord Free Public Library [http://www.concordlibrary.org/scollect/Fin_Aids/TEALE.htm Special Collections], Concord, Massachusetts. 1999, accessed 3/3/2008&lt;/ref&gt; and the Conservation Medal from the [http://www.newfs.org/ New England Wildflower Society].&lt;ref&gt;New England Wildflower Society, [http://www.newfs.org/about/awards/award-winners.html Award Winners 1964-Present], accessed 3/3/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Teale was an elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the New York Academy of Sciences, and an associate of the Royal Photographic Society.

== Death ==
In 1980 while working with author [[Ann Zwinger]] on the book ''A Conscious Stillness: Two Naturalists on Thoreau's Rivers'', Teale died.  Teale's portion of the book was nearly complete at the time of his death, and he was included as co-author when the book was published in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Zwinger and Edwin Way Teale. ''A Conscious Stillness: Two Naturalists on Thoreau's Rivers'', 1982, Harper &amp; Row, jacket text.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teale's body was buried at North Cemetery, [[Hampton, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7320359 Find-A-Grave biography], accessed 3/2/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Gaia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|eɪ|.|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|aɪ|.|ə}}; from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|Γαῖα}}, a poetical form of Γῆ ''Gē'', "land" or "earth"),&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell; Robert Scott. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dgai%3Da "γαῖα"], ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]''&lt;/ref&gt; also spelled '''Gaea''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|iː|ə}}), is the personification of the [[Earth]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DG%3Aentry+group%3D1%3Aentry%3Dgaea-bio-1 "Gaea"].&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the [[Greek primordial deities]]. Gaia is the ancestral mother of all life: the primal [[Mother Goddess|Mother Earth]] goddess. She is the immediate parent of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] (the sky), from whose sexual union she bore the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] (themselves parents of many of the [[Greek pantheon|Olympian gods]]) and the [[Giants (Greek mythology)|Giants]], and of [[Pontus (mythology)|Pontus]] (the sea), from whose union she bore the [[Greek sea gods|primordial sea gods]]. Her equivalent in the Roman pantheon was [[Terra (mythology)|Terra]].&lt;ref name=Lar&gt;''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Greek language|Greek]] name Γαῖα (''Gaĩa'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dgai%3Da Entry "γαῖα"], in: [[Liddell–Scott]], ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', in the ''Perseus Digital Library''.&lt;/ref&gt; is a mostly epic, collateral form of Attic Γῆ&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dgh%3D Entry "γῆ"], in: Liddell–Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', in the ''Perseus Digital Library''.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Gê''), [[Doric Greek|Doric]] Γᾶ (''Gã'', perhaps identical to Δᾶ ''Dã'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dda%3D2 Entry "δᾶ"], in: Liddell–Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', in the ''Perseus Digital Library''.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "[[Earth]]", a word of uncertain origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Gaia Entry "Gaia"], in the ''Online Etymology Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert S. P. Beekes]] has suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] origin.&lt;ref name=Beekes&gt;Robert S. P. Beekes, ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, pp. 269–270 (''s.v.'' "γῆ").&lt;/ref&gt; It, however, could be related to the [[Avestan]] word ''gaiia'' "life" (cf. ''gaēθā'' "[material] world, totality of creatures" and ''gaēθiia'' "belonging to, residing in the worldly or material sphere, material") or perhaps to Avestan ''gairi'' "mountain".{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In [[Mycenean Greek]] ''Ma-ka'' (transliterated as ''Ma-ga'', "Mother Gaia") also contains the root ''ga-''.&lt;ref name=Beekes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=346416 |title=Paleolexicon |accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==

===Hesiod===
[[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' tells how, after [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]], "wide-bosomed" Gaia (Earth) arose to be the everlasting seat of the [[Twelve Olympians|immortals who possess Olympus]] above,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]]. ''[[Theogony]],'' ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+116 116–118]''&lt;/ref&gt; and the depths of Tartarus below (as some scholars interpret it).&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod. ''Theogony'', ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+119&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130 119]''. Translated by [[Glenn W. Most]] in [[Loeb Classical Library]]&lt;/ref&gt; He then tells that Gaia brought forth her equal [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] (Heaven, Sky) to "cover her on every side" and to be the abode of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod. ''Theogony, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+126 126–128]''&lt;/ref&gt; Gaia also bore the hills ([[ourea]]), and [[Pontus (mythology)|Pontus]] (Sea), "without sweet union of love" (i.e., with no father).&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod. ''Theogony, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+129 129–132].''&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards with Uranus she gave birth to the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]s, as Hesiod tells it:&lt;blockquote&gt;''She lay with [[Uranus (mythology)|Heaven]] and bore deep-swirling [[Oceanus]], [[Coeus]] and [[Crius]] and [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]] and [[Iapetus (mythology)|Iapetus]], [[Theia]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], [[Themis]] and [[Mnemosyne]] and gold-crowned [[Phoebe (mythology)|Phoebe]] and lovely [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]]. After them was born Cronos ([[Cronus]]) the wily, youngest and most terrible of her children, and he hated his lusty sire.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod. ''Theogony, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+119&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130 132–138]''&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Hesiod, Gaia conceived further offspring with Uranus, first the giant one-eyed [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]]: Brontes ("Thunder"), Steropes ("Lightning") and [[Arges (cyclops)|Arges]] ("Bright");&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod. ''Theogony,'' ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+139 139–146]''&lt;/ref&gt; then the [[Hecatonchires]]: Cottus, Briareos and Gyges, each with a hundred arms and fifty heads.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod. ''Theogony, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+147 147–153]''&lt;/ref&gt; As each of the Cyclopes and Hecatonchires were born, Uranus hid them in a secret place within Gaia, causing her great pain. So Gaia devised a plan. She created a grey flint (or [[adamant]]ine) sickle. And Cronus used the sickle to castrate his father Uranus as he approached Gaia to have sex with her. From Uranus' spilled blood, Gaia produced the [[Erinyes]], the [[Gigantes|Giants]] and the [[Meliae]] (ash-tree nymphs). From the testicles of Uranus in the sea came forth [[Aphrodite]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod. ''Theogony,'' ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+154 154–200]''&lt;/ref&gt;

By her son Pontus, Gaia bore the sea-deities [[Nereus]], [[Thaumas]], [[Phorcys]], [[Ceto]], and [[Eurybia (mythology)|Eurybia]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod. ''Theogony, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+233 233–239]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Cronus had learned from Gaia and Uranus that he was destined to be overthrown by one of his children, he swallowed each of the children born to him by his Titan sister Rhea. But when Rhea was pregnant with her youngest child, [[Zeus]], she sought help from Gaia and Uranus. When [[Zeus]] was born, Rhea gave Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling-clothes in his place, which Cronus swallowed, and Gaia took the child into her care.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod. ''Theogony, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+453 453–491]''&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of Gaia's advice,&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod. ''Theogony, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+626 626].''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeus]] defeated the Titans. But afterwards, Gaia, in union with Tartarus, bore the youngest of her sons [[Typhon]], who would be the last challenge to the authority of Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod. ''Theogony, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+820 820–880]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Birth Erikhthonios Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2413.jpg|thumb|right|Gaia hands her newborn, Erichthonius, to [[Athena]] as Hephaestus watches - an Attic [[red-figure]] [[stamnos]], 470–460 BC]]

===Other sources===
According to [[Hyginus]], Earth (Gaia), along with Heaven and Sea were the children of [[Aether (mythology)|Aether]] and Day ([[Hemera]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]]. ''Fabulae, [https://topostext.org/work/206#Preface Preface]''&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pseudo-Apollodorus|Apollodorus]], Gaia and Tartarus were the parents of [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]].&lt;ref name="Apollo 2.1.2"&gt;[[Pseudo-|Pseudo]]-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]]. ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.%202.1.2&amp;lang=original 2.1.2]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeus hid [[Elara (mythology)|Elara]], one of his lovers, from [[Hera]] by stowing her under the earth. His son by Elara, the giant [[Tityos]], is therefore sometimes said to be a son of Gaia, the earth goddess.

Gaia also made [[Aristaeus]] immortal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Floyd |first1=Edwin |title=Transactions and Proceedings of the American … |date=1968 |publisher=The john hopkins university press |pages=22 |edition=1st |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2935839 |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depiction==

In classical art Gaia was represented in one of two ways. In Athenian vase painting she was shown as a matronly woman only half risen from the earth, often in the act of handing the baby [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]],a future king of Athens, to Athena to foster). In mosaic representations, she appears as a woman reclining upon the earth surrounded by a host of Carpi, infant gods of the fruits of the earth.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Cult==

[[Oath]]s sworn in the name of Gaia, in ancient Greece, were considered the most binding of all.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

She was also worshipped under the epithet "Anesidora", which means "giver of gifts".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+1.31.4&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160:book=1:chapter=31&amp;highlight=Anesidora ''Description of Greece,'' ''1.31.4'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesychius of Alexandria]] ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]], ''On [[Theocritus]]'' ii. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Other epithets was Calligeneia&lt;ref&gt;(Aristoph. Thesm. 300, with the Schol.; Hesych. s. v.; Phot. Lex. s. v.)&lt;/ref&gt;, Eurusternos&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+7.25.13&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160:book=7:chapter=25&amp;highlight=Broad 7.25.13]''&lt;/ref&gt;, and Pandôros.&lt;ref&gt;Homeros. Epigr. 7. 1; Stob. Eclog. i. p. 165, ed. Heeren.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient times, Gaia was mainly worshipped alongside Demeter and as a part of the cult of Demeter, and does not seem to have had a separate cult. Being a chthonic deity, black animals were sacrificed to her:  
:''"[Sacrifices to the gods as witnesses of an oath :] Bring two lambs : let one be white and the other black for Gaia (Earth) and Helios (Sun)." [N.B. Chthonic Gaia receives a black animal, heavenly Helios a white one.]&lt;ref&gt;Homer, Iliad 3. 104 ff (trans. Lattimore) (Greek epic C8th B.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;''

===Temples===

Gaia is believed by some sources&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fontenrose 1959&lt;/ref&gt; to be the original deity behind the [[Pythia|Oracle]] at [[Delphi]]. It was thus said: "That word spoken from tree-clad mother Gaia's (Earth's) navel-stone [Delphoi]."&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, Pythian Ode 4 str 4 (trans. Conway) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.)&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the source, Gaia passed her powers on to [[Poseidon]], [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]], or [[Themis]]. Pausanias wrote:
:''"Many and different are the stories told about Delphoi, and even more son about the oracle of Apollon. For they say that in earliest times the oracular seat belonged to Ge (Earth), who appointed as prophetess at it Daphnis, one of the [[Nymphai]] (Nymphs) of the mountains. There is extant among the Greeks an hexameter poem, the name of which is Eumolpia, and it is assigned to Musaios (Musaeus), son of Antiophemos. In it the poet states that the oracle belonged to Poseidon and Ge (Earth) in common; that Ge (Earth) gave her oracles herself, but Poseidon used Pyrkon (Pyrcon) as his mouthpiece in giving responses. The verses are these:--‘Forthwith the voice of Khthonie (Chthonia) uttered a wise word, And with her Pyrkon, servant of the renown Earthshaker.’ They say that afterwards Ge (Earth) gave her share to Themis, who gave it to Apollon as a gift. It is said that he to Poseidon Kalaureia (Calaurea), that lies off Troizenos (Troezen), in exchange for his oracle."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+10.5.5&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160:book=10:chapter=5&amp;highlight=Earth 10.5.5 ff]''&lt;/ref&gt;''

Apollo is the best-known as the oracle power behind Delphi, long established by the time of Homer, having killed Gaia's child [[Python (mythology)|Python]] there and usurped the [[chthonic]] power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Classical Mythology|last=Hansen|first=William F.|last2=Hansen|first2=Randall|publisher=ABC-CLIO, LLC|year=2004|isbn=9781851096343|edition=1|pages=109-112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hera punished Apollo for this by sending him to King [[Admetus]] as a shepherd for nine years.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Gaia or Ge had at least three sanctuaries in Greece, which where mentioned by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]. There was a temple of Ge Eurusternos on the Crathis near Aegae in Achaia, with "a very ancient statue":&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+7.25.13&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160:book=7:chapter=25&amp;highlight=Broad 7.25.13 ff]''&lt;/ref&gt;

:''"It is a journey of about thirty stades [from the stream of Krathis (Crathis) near the ruins of Aigai (Aegae) in Akhaia] to what is called the Gaion (Gaeum), a sanctuary of Ge (Earth) surnamed Eurysternos (Broad-bossomed), whose wooden image is one of the very oldest. The woman who from time to time is priestess henceforth remains chaste, and before her election must not have had intercourse with more than one man. The test applied is drinking bull's blood. Any woman who may chance not to speak the truth is immediately punished as a result of this test. If several women compete for the priesthood, lots are cast for the honour."''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Pausanias also mention the sanctuary of Ge Gasepton in [[Sparta]],&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+3.12.8&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160:book=3:chapter=12&amp;highlight=Gasepton 3.12.8 ff]''&lt;/ref&gt; and a sanctuary of Ge Kourotrophe (Nurse of the Young) at Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+1.22.3&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160:book=1:chapter=22&amp;highlight=Nurse 1.22.3 ff]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from her temples, Gaia also had altars as well as sacred spaces in the sanctuaries of other gods. Close to the sanctuary of Eileithyia in  Tegea was an altar of Ge;&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+8.48.8&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160:book=8:chapter=48&amp;highlight=Earth 8.48.8 ff]''&lt;/ref&gt; Phlya and Myrrhinos had an altar to Ge under the name Thea Megale (Great goddess);&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+1.31.4&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160:book=1:chapter=318&amp;highlight=Earth 1.31.4]''&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as Olympia which additionally, similar to Delphi, also said to have had an oracle to Gaia: 
:''"On what is called the Gaion (Gaeum, Sanctuary of Ge) [at Olympia] is an altar of Ge (Earth); it too is of ashes. In more ancient days they say that there was an oracle also of Ge (Earth) in this place. On what is called the Stomion (Mouth) the altar to Themis has been built."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+5.14.10&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160:book=5:chapter=14&amp;highlight=Gaeum 5.14.10]''&lt;/ref&gt;''

Her statue where naturally to be found in the temples of Demeter, such as the Temple of Demeter in Achaia: "They [the Patraians of Akhaia (Achaea)] have also a grove by the sea, affording in summer weather very agreeable walks and a pleasant means generally of passing the time. In this grove are also two temples of divinities, one of Apollon, the other of Aphrodite . . . Next to the grove is a sanctuary of Demeter; she and her daughter [Persephone] are standing, but the image of Ge (Earth) is seated."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+7.21.11&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160:book=7:chapter=21&amp;highlight=Earth 7.21.11]''&lt;/ref&gt; The Temple of Zeus Olympios in Athens reportedly had an enclosure of Ge Olympia: 
:''"[Within the sanctuary of Zeus Olympios in the lower town of Athens :] Within the precincts are antiquities : a bronze Zeus, a temple of Kronos (Cronus) and Rhea and an enclosure of Ge (Earth) surnamed Olympia. Here the floor opens to the width of a cubit, and they say that along this bed flowed off the water after the deluge that occurred in the time of Deukalion, and into it they cast every year wheat mixed with honey . . . The ancient sanctuary of Zeus Olympios the Athenians say was built by Deukalion (Deucalion), and they cite as evidence that Deukalion lived at Athens a grave which is not far from the present temple."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+1.18.7&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160:book=1:chapter=18&amp;highlight=Earth 1.18.7 ff.]''&lt;/ref&gt;''

In Athens, there was a statue of Gaia on the Acropolis decpicting her besieging Zeus for rain,&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+1.24.3&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160:book=1:chapter=24&amp;highlight=Earth 1.24.3 ff.]''&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as an image of her close to the court of the Areopagos in Athens, alongside the statues of Plouton and Hermes, "by which sacrifice those who have received an acquittal on the Areopagos".&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+1.28.6&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160:book=1:chapter=28&amp;highlight=Earth 1.28.6 ff.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
Some modern sources, such as [[James Mellaart]], [[Marija Gimbutas]] and [[Barbara G. Walker (author)|Barbara Walker]], claim that Gaia as Mother Earth is a later form of a [[Neolithic Europe|pre-Indo-European]] [[Mother goddess|Great Mother]], venerated in [[Neolithic]] times. Her existence is a speculation, and controversial in the academic community. Some modern mythographers, including [[Karl Kerenyi]], [[Carl A. P. Ruck]] and [[Danny Staples]] interpret the goddesses [[Demeter]] the "mother," [[Persephone]] the "daughter" and [[Hecate]] the "crone," as aspects of a former Great goddess identified by some{{who|date=April 2012}} as [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] or as Gaia herself. In [[Crete]], a goddess was worshiped as ''[[Potnia Theron]]'' (the "Mistress of the Animals") or simply [[Potnia]] ("Mistress"), speculated{{by whom|date=April 2012}} as Rhea or Gaia; the title was later applied in Greek texts to [[Demeter]], [[Artemis]] or [[Athena]]. The mother-goddess [[Cybele]] from [[Anatolia]] (modern [[Turkey]]) was partly identified by the Greeks with Gaia, but more so with Rhea and Demeter.[[File:Aion mosaic Glyptothek Munich W504.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aion (deity)|Aion]] and Gaia with four children, perhaps the personified seasons, mosaic from a Roman villa in [[Sentinum]], first half of the third century BC, ([[Munich]] Glyptothek, Inv. W504)]]

== Neopaganism ==
Many [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]] worship Gaia. Beliefs regarding Gaia vary, ranging from the belief that Gaia is the Earth to the belief that she is the spiritual embodiment of the earth, or the Goddess of the Earth.&lt;ref name="Pike2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarah M. Pike|title=New Age and Neopagan Religions in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K9SdBhs8SfoC|date=13 August 2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-50838-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern ecological theory==
{{Main|Gaia hypothesis}}

The mythological name was revived in 1979 by [[James Lovelock]], in ''Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth''; his [[Gaia hypothesis]] was supported by [[Lynn Margulis]]. The hypothesis proposes that living organisms and inorganic material are part of a [[dynamical systems|dynamical system]] that shapes the [[Earth]]'s [[biosphere]], and maintains the Earth as a fit environment for life. In some Gaia theory approaches, the Earth itself is viewed as an organism with self-regulatory functions. Further books by Lovelock and others popularized the [[Gaia Hypothesis]], which was embraced to some extent by [[New Age]] environmentalists as part of the heightened [[Environmentalism|awareness of environmental concerns]] of the 1990s.

{{Sustainable energy}}

'''Geothermal power''' is [[electricity generation|power generated]] by [[geothermal energy]]. Technologies in use include dry steam power stations, flash steam power stations and binary cycle power stations. Geothermal electricity generation is currently used in 24 countries,&lt;ref name=gea2010/&gt; while [[geothermal heating]] is in use in 70 countries.&lt;ref name="IPCC"/&gt;

As of 2015, worldwide geothermal power capacity amounts to 12.8 [[gigawatt]]s (GW), of which 28 percent or 3,548 megawatts are installed in the [[Geothermal energy in the United States|United States]]. International markets grew at an average annual rate of 5 percent over the three years to 2015, and global geothermal power capacity is expected to reach 14.5–17.6&amp;nbsp;GW by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geo-energy.org/reports/2015/Int'lMarketataGlanceMay2015Final5_14_15.pdf |title=The International Geothermal Market At a Glance – May 2015 |publisher=GEA—Geothermal Energy Association |date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on current geologic knowledge and technology the GEA publicly discloses, the [[Geothermal Energy Association]] (GEA) estimates that only 6.9 percent of total global potential has been tapped so far, while the [[IPCC]] reported geothermal power potential to be in the range of 35&amp;nbsp;GW to 2&amp;nbsp;[[terawatt|TW]].&lt;ref name="IPCC" /&gt; Countries generating more than 15 percent of their electricity from geothermal sources include [[Geothermal power in El Salvador|El Salvador]], [[Geothermal power in Kenya|Kenya]], the [[Geothermal power in the Philippines|Philippines]], [[Geothermal power in Iceland|Iceland]], [[New Zealand]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.icebookshop.com/Products/Geothermal-Energy,-Heat-Exchange-Systems-and-Energ.aspx|title=Geothermal Energy, Heat Exchange Systems and Energy Piles|last=Craig|first=William|last2=Gavin|first2=Kenneth|publisher=ICE Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9780727763983|location=London|pages=41-42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Costa Rica]].

Geothermal power is considered to be a [[sustainability|sustainable]], [[renewable energy|renewable]] source of energy because the heat extraction is small compared with the [[Earth's internal heat budget|Earth's heat content]].&lt;ref name="sustainability" /&gt; The [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|greenhouse gas emissions]] of geothermal electric stations are on average 45&amp;nbsp;grams of [[carbon dioxide]] per kilowatt-hour of electricity, or less than 5 percent of that of conventional coal-fired plants.&lt;ref name="IPCC Annex II"&gt;Moomaw, W., P. Burgherr, G. Heath, M. Lenzen, J. Nyboer, A. Verbruggen, [http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_Annex_II.pdf 2011: Annex II: Methodology. In IPCC: Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (ref. page 10)]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a source of renewable energy for both power and heating, geothermal has the potential to meet 3-5% of global demand by 2050. With economic incentives, it is estimated that by 2100 it will be possible to meet 10% of global demand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History and development ==
In the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, demand for electricity led to the consideration of geothermal power as a generating source. [[Piero Ginori Conti|Prince Piero Ginori Conti]] tested the first geothermal power generator on 4 July 1904 in [[Larderello]], Italy. It successfully lit four light bulbs.&lt;ref&gt;Tiwari, G. N.; Ghosal, M. K. ''Renewable Energy Resources: Basic Principles and Applications.'' Alpha Science Int'l Ltd., 2005 {{ISBN|1-84265-125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1911, the world's first commercial geothermal power station was built there. Experimental generators were built in [[Beppu]], Japan and [[the Geysers]], California, in the 1920s, but Italy was the world's only industrial producer of geothermal electricity until 1958.

[[File:geothermal capacity.svg|thumb|left|Global geothermal electric capacity. Upper red line is installed capacity;&lt;ref name="Bertani"/&gt; lower green line is realized production.&lt;ref name="IPCC" /&gt;]]

In 1958, New Zealand became the second major industrial producer of geothermal electricity when its [[Wairakei Power Station|Wairakei station]] was commissioned. Wairakei was the first station to use flash steam technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipenz.org.nz/heritage/itemdetail.cfm?itemid=84 IPENZ Engineering Heritage]. Ipenz.org.nz. Retrieved 13 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past 60 years, net fluid production has been in excess of 2.5 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Subsidence|Subsidience]] at Wairakei-Tauhara has been an issue in a number of formal hearings related to environmental consents for expanded development of the system as a source of renewable energy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1960, [[Pacific Gas and Electric]] began operation of the first successful geothermal electric power station in the United States at The Geysers in California.&lt;ref name="100years" /&gt; The original turbine lasted for more than 30&amp;nbsp;years and produced 11&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] net power.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the [[1970s energy crisis]] and significant changes in regulatory policies. This technology allows the use of much lower temperature resources than were previously recoverable. In 2006, a binary cycle station in [[Chena Hot Springs, Alaska]], came on-line, producing electricity from a record low fluid temperature of 57&amp;nbsp;°C (135&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name="Chena"/&gt;

Geothermal electric stations have until recently been built exclusively where high temperature geothermal resources are available near the surface. The development of [[binary cycle power plant]]s and improvements in drilling and extraction technology may enable [[enhanced geothermal systems]] over a much greater geographical range.&lt;ref name="INEL" /&gt; Demonstration projects are operational in [[Landau-Pfalz]], Germany, and [[Soultz-sous-Forêts]], France, while an earlier effort in [[Basel]], Switzerland was shut down after it triggered earthquakes.

The [[thermal efficiency]] of geothermal electric stations is low, around 7–10%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schavemaker|first1=Pieter|last2=van der Sluis|first2=Lou|title=Electrical Power Systems Essentials|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=978-0470-51027-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; because geothermal fluids are at a low temperature compared with steam from boilers. By the laws of [[thermodynamics]] this low temperature limits the efficiency of [[Cycle efficiency|heat engines]] in extracting useful energy during the generation of electricity. Exhaust heat is wasted, unless it can be used directly and locally, for example in greenhouses, timber mills, and district heating. The efficiency of the system does not affect operational costs as it would for a coal or other fossil fuel plant, but it does factor into the viability of the station. In order to produce more energy than the pumps consume, electricity generation requires high temperature geothermal fields and specialized heat cycles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy, unlike, for example, wind or solar, its [[capacity factor]] can be quite large – up to 96% has been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These power rates are more than double humanity’s current energy consumption from primary sources, but most of this power is too diffuse (approximately 0.1 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on average) to be recoverable. The [[Earth's crust]] effectively acts as a thick insulating blanket which must be pierced by fluid conduits (of [[magma]], water or other) to release the heat underneath.

Electricity generation requires high-temperature resources that can only come from deep underground. The heat must be carried to the surface by fluid circulation, either through [[magma conduit]]s, [[hot springs]], [[hydrothermal circulation]], [[oil well]]s, drilled water wells, or a combination of these. This circulation sometimes exists naturally where the crust is thin: magma conduits bring heat close to the surface, and hot springs bring the heat to the surface. If no hot spring is available, a well must be drilled into a hot [[aquifer]]. Away from tectonic plate boundaries the [[geothermal gradient]] is 25–30&amp;nbsp;°C per kilometre (km) of depth in most of the world, so wells would have to be several kilometres deep to permit electricity generation.&lt;ref name="IPCC" /&gt; The quantity and quality of recoverable resources improves with drilling depth and proximity to tectonic plate boundaries.

In ground that is hot but dry, or where water pressure is inadequate, injected fluid can stimulate production. Developers bore two holes into a candidate site, and fracture the rock between them with explosives or high-pressure water. Then they pump water or liquefied carbon dioxide down one borehole, and it comes up the other borehole as a gas.&lt;ref name="INEL" /&gt; This approach is called [[hot dry rock geothermal energy]] in Europe, or [[enhanced geothermal systems]] in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.&lt;ref name="INEL" /&gt;

Estimates of the electricity generating potential of geothermal energy vary from 35 to 2000&amp;nbsp;GW depending on the scale of investments.&lt;ref name="IPCC"/&gt; This does not include non-electric heat recovered by co-generation, geothermal heat pumps and other direct use. A 2006 report by [[MIT|the Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) that included the potential of enhanced geothermal systems estimated that investing 1&amp;nbsp;billion US&amp;nbsp;dollars in research and development over 15&amp;nbsp;years would allow the creation of 100&amp;nbsp;GW of electrical generating capacity by 2050 in the United States alone.&lt;ref name="INEL"/&gt; The MIT report estimated that over {{Convert|200E9|TJ|ZJ TWh|abbr=on}} would be extractable, with the potential to increase this to over 2,000&amp;nbsp;ZJ with technology improvements – sufficient to provide all the world's present energy needs for several [[Millennium|millennia]].&lt;ref name="INEL" /&gt;

At present, geothermal wells are rarely more than {{convert|3|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} deep.&lt;ref name="IPCC" /&gt; Upper estimates of geothermal resources assume wells as deep as {{convert|10|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}. Drilling near this depth is now possible in the petroleum industry, although it is an expensive process. The deepest research well in the world, the [[Kola superdeep borehole]] (KSDB-3), is {{Convert|12.261|km|mi|abbr=on}} deep.&lt;ref name="ICDP_KSDB3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kola|url=https://www.icdp-online.org/projects/world/europe/kola-russia/|website=www.icdp-online.org|publisher=ICDP|accessdate=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This record has recently been imitated by commercial oil wells, such as [[Exxon]]'s Z-12 well in the Chayvo field, [[Sakhalin-I|Sakhalin]].&lt;ref&gt;

Wells drilled to depths greater than {{convert|4|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} generally incur drilling costs in the tens of millions of dollars.&lt;ref name="econ101" /&gt; The technological challenges are to drill wide bores at low cost and to break larger volumes of rock.

Geothermal power is considered to be sustainable because the heat extraction is small compared to the Earth's heat content, but extraction must still be monitored to avoid local depletion.&lt;ref name="sustainability" /&gt; Although geothermal sites are capable of providing heat for many decades, individual wells may cool down or run out of water. The three oldest sites, at Larderello, [[Wairakei#Geothermal field|Wairakei]], and the Geysers have all reduced production from their peaks. It is not clear whether these stations extracted energy faster than it was replenished from greater depths, or whether the aquifers supplying them are being depleted. If production is reduced, and water is reinjected, these wells could theoretically recover their full potential. Such mitigation strategies have already been implemented at some sites. The long-term sustainability of geothermal energy has been demonstrated at the Lardarello field in Italy since 1913, at the Wairakei field in New Zealand since 1958,&lt;ref name="Wairakei"&gt;

Geothermal power stations are similar to other steam turbine [[thermal power station]]s in that heat from a fuel source (in geothermal's case, the Earth's core) is used to heat water or another [[Working fluids|working fluid]]. The working fluid is then used to turn a turbine of a generator, thereby producing electricity. The fluid is then cooled and returned to the heat source.

=== Dry steam power stations ===
Dry steam stations are the simplest and oldest design. This type of power station is not found very often, because it requires a resource that produces dry steam, but is the most efficient, with the simplest facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tabak|first1=John|title=Solar and Geothermal Energy|date=2009|publisher=Facts On File, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8160-7086-2|pages=97-183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these sites, there may be liquid water present in the reservoir, but no water is produced to the surface, only steam. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tabak|first1=John|title=Solar and Geothermal Energy|date=2009|publisher=Facts On File, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8160-7086-2|pages=97-183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dry Steam Power directly uses geothermal steam of 150&amp;nbsp;°C or greater to turn turbines.&lt;ref name="IPCC"&gt;{{Citation|first1=Ingvar B. |last1=Fridleifsson, |first2=Ruggero |last2=Bertani |first3=Ernst |last3=Huenges |first4=John W. |last4=Lund |first5=Arni |last5=Ragnarsson |first6=Ladislaus |last6=Rybach |date=11 February 2008 |title=The possible role and contribution of geothermal energy to the mitigation of climate change |conference=IPCC Scoping Meeting on Renewable Energy Sources |editor=O.

Here the steam turns back into a liquid which then cools the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gawell|first1=Karl|title=Economic Costs and Benefits of Geothermal Power|url=http://geo-energy.org/reports/Economic%20Cost%20and%20Benfits_Publication_6_16.pdf|accessdate=9 March 2018|agency=Geothermal Energy Assosiation|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the water is cooled it flows down a pipe that conducts the condensate back into deep wells, where it can be reheated and produced again. At [[The Geysers]] in California, after the first thirty years of power production, the steam supply had depleted and generation was substantially reduced. To restore some of the former capacity, supplemental water injection was developed during the 1990s and 2000s, including utilization of effluent from nearby municipal sewage treatment facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Scientific American Editors|title=The Future of Energy: Earth, Wind and Fire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pGfQmBtXYx0C&amp;pg=PT160|date=8 April 2013|publisher=Scientific American|isbn=978-1-4668-3386-9|pages=160–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flash steam power stations ===
Flash steam stations pull deep, high-pressure hot water into lower-pressure tanks and use the resulting flashed steam to drive turbines. They require fluid temperatures of at least 180&amp;nbsp;°C, usually more. This is the most common type of station in operation today. Flash steam plants use geothermal reservoirs of water with temperatures greater than 360&amp;nbsp;°F (182&amp;nbsp;°C). The hot water flows up through wells in the ground under its own pressure. As it flows upward, the pressure decreases and some of the hot water boils into steam. The steam is then separated from the water and used to power a turbine/generator. Any leftover water and condensed steam may be injected back into the reservoir, making this a potentially sustainable resource.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/powerplants.html US DOE EERE Hydrothermal Power Systems]. eere.energy.gov (22 February 2012).

Binary cycle power stations are the most recent development, and can accept fluid temperatures as low as 57&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Chena"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moderately hot geothermal water is passed by a secondary fluid with a much lower boiling point than water. This causes the secondary fluid to flash vaporize, which then drives the turbines. This is the most common type of geothermal electricity station being constructed today.&lt;ref name="EERE1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/geothermal_basics.html|title=Geothermal Basics Overview|publisher=Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|accessdate=1 October 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004020606/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/geothermal_basics.html|archivedate=4 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Organic Rankine]] and [[Kalina cycle]]s are used.

The International Geothermal Association (IGA) has reported that 10,715 [[megawatts]] (MW) of geothermal power in 24 countries is online, which is expected to generate 67,246 [[GWh]] of electricity in 2010.&lt;ref name=gea2010/&gt; This represents a 20% increase in geothermal power online capacity since 2005. IGA projected this would grow to 18,500 MW by 2015, due to the large number of projects that were under consideration, often in areas previously assumed to have little exploitable resource.&lt;ref name=gea2010&gt;Geothermal Energy Association.

Fluids drawn from the deep earth carry a mixture of gases, notably [[carbon dioxide]] ({{chem|CO|2|}}), [[hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem|H|2|S|}}), [[methane]] ({{chem|CH|4|}}), [[ammonia]] ({{chem|NH|3|}}) and [[radon]] ({{chem|Rn|}}). These pollutants contribute to [[global warming]], [[acid rain]], radiation and noxious smells if released.{{not in citation given|date=January 2018}}

Existing geothermal electric stations, that fall within the [[Percentile|50th percentile]] of all total life cycle emissions studies reviewed by the [[IPCC]], produce on average 45&amp;nbsp;kg of {{chem|CO|2|}} equivalent emissions per megawatt-hour of generated electricity (kg {{chem|CO|2|}}eq/[[megawatt-hour|MW·h]]). For comparison, a coal-fired power plant emits 1,001&amp;nbsp;kg of {{chem|CO|2|}} per megawatt-hour when not coupled with [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS).&lt;ref name="IPCC Annex II" /&gt;

Stations that experience high levels of acids and volatile chemicals are usually equipped with emission-control systems to reduce the exhaust. Geothermal stations could theoretically inject these gases back into the earth, as a form of carbon capture and storage.

In addition to dissolved gases, hot water from geothermal sources may hold in solution trace amounts of toxic chemicals, such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[arsenic]], [[boron]], [[antimony]], and salt.&lt;ref name="toxic"&gt;

The project in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] was suspended because more than 10,000 seismic events measuring up to 3.4 on the [[Richter Scale]] occurred over the first 6 days of water injection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=Deichmann, N. |author2=Mai, M. |author3=Bethmann, F. |author4=Ernst, J. |author5=Evans, K. |author6=Fäh, D. |author7=Giardini, D. |author8=Häring, M. |author9=Husen, S. |author10=Kästli, P. |author11=Bachmann, C. |author12=Ripperger, J. |author13=Schanz, U. |author14=Wiemer, S. |title=Seismicity Induced by Water Injection for Geothermal Reservoir Stimulation 5&amp;nbsp;km Below the City of Basel, Switzerland |year=2007 |journal=American Geophysical Union |publisher=American Geophysical Union |bibcode=2007AGUFM.V53F..08D |volume=53 |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of geothermal drilling leading to [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]] has been experienced in [[Staufen im Breisgau]].

Geothermal has minimal land and freshwater requirements. Geothermal stations use 404&amp;nbsp;square&amp;nbsp;meters per&amp;nbsp;[[gigawatt-hour|GW·h]] versus 3,632 and 1,335&amp;nbsp;square&amp;nbsp;meters for coal facilities and wind farms respectively.&lt;ref name="utilization" /&gt; They use 20&amp;nbsp;litres of freshwater per MW·h versus over 1000&amp;nbsp;litres per&amp;nbsp;MW·h for nuclear, coal, or oil.&lt;ref name="utilization" /&gt;

Geothermal power stations can also disrupt the natural cycles of geysers. For example, the [[Beowawe, Nevada]] geysers, which were uncapped geothermal wells, stopped erupting due to the development of the dual-flash station.

== Economics ==
:''See also: [[Cost of electricity by source]].''
Geothermal power requires no fuel; it is therefore immune to fuel cost fluctuations. However, [[capital costs]] tend to be high. Drilling accounts for over half the costs, and exploration of deep resources entails significant risks. A typical well doublet in Nevada can support 4.5 [[megawatts]] (MW) of electricity generation and costs about $10 million to drill, with a 20% failure rate.&lt;ref name="econ101"&gt;

The '''[[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] Red List of Threatened Species''' (also known as the '''IUCN Red List''' or '''Red Data List'''), founded in 1965, has evolved to become the world's most comprehensive inventory of the global [[Conservation movement|conservation]] status of [[species|biological species]]. It uses a set of criteria to evaluate the extinction risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. With its strong scientific base, the IUCN Red List is recognized as the most authoritative guide to the status of biological diversity. A series of [[Regional Red List]] are produced by countries or organizations, which assess the risk of extinction to species within a political management unit.

The IUCN Red List is set upon precise criteria to evaluate the [[extinction]] risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. The aim is to convey the urgency of conservation issues to the public and policy makers, as well as help the international community to try to reduce species extinction.  According to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) (1996), the formally stated goals of the Red List are (1) to provide scientifically based information on the status of species and subspecies at a global level, (2) to draw attention to the magnitude and importance of threatened  biodiversity, (3) to influence national and international policy and decision-making, and (4) to provide information to guide actions to conserve biological diversity.&lt;ref&gt;CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), Joint Meeting of the Animals and Plants Committees, Shepherdstown (United States of America), 7–9 December 2000, retrieved Nov 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Major species assessors include [[BirdLife International]], the [[Institute of Zoology]] (the research division of the [[Zoological Society of London]]), the [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]], and many Specialist Groups within the [[IUCN Species Survival Commission]] (SSC). Collectively, assessments by these organizations and groups account for nearly half the species on the Red List.

The IUCN aims to have the category of every species re-evaluated every five years if possible, or at least every ten years. This is done in a [[peer review]]ed manner through IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Specialist Groups, which are Red List Authorities responsible for a species, group of species or specific geographic area, or in the case of [[BirdLife International]], an entire class ([[Bird|Aves]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org//about/overview#redlist_authorities |title=Red List Overview |work=IUCN Red List |publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] |accessdate=20 June 2012 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630010436/http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/overview#redlist_authorities |archivedate=30 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964 Red List of Threatened Plants===

The 1964 IUCN Red List of Threatened Plants used the older pre-criteria Red List assessment system. Plants listed may not, therefore, appear in the current Red List. IUCN advise that it is best to check both the online Red List and the 1997 plants Red List publication.&lt;ref name="IUCN-FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org//info/faq#Why_not_all_species_on_RL_ |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=IUCN |accessdate=11 October 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627094911/http://www.iucnredlist.org//info/faq#Why_not_all_species_on_RL_ |archivedate=27 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 release===
The 2006 Red List, released on 4 May 2006 evaluated 40,168 species as a whole, plus an additional 2,160 [[subspecies]], [[Variety (botany)|varieties]], aquatic [[Fish stock|stocks]], and [[Statistical population|subpopulation]]s.

===2007 release===
On 12 September 2007, the [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) released the '''2007 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species'''. In this release, they have raised their classification of both the [[western lowland gorilla]] (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'') and the [[Cross River gorilla]] (''Gorilla gorilla diehli'') from [[endangered]] to [[critically endangered]], which is the last category before [[extinct in the wild]], due to [[Ebola virus]] and [[poaching]], along with other factors. [[Russ Mittermeier]], chief of [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-based IUCN's Primate Specialist Group, stated that 16,306 species are endangered with extinction, 188 more than in 2006 (total of 41,415 species on the Red List). The Red List includes the [[Sumatran orangutan]] (''Pongo abelii'') in the Critically Endangered category and the [[Bornean orangutan]] (''Pongo pygmaeus'') in the Endangered category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucn.org/media/materials/releases/?81/Extinction-crisis-escalates-Red-List-shows-apes-corals-vultures-dolphins-all-in-danger IUCN.org news release, Extinction crisis escalates: Red List shows apes, corals, vultures, dolphins all in danger]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 release===
The 2008 Red List was released on 6 October 2008, at the IUCN World Conservation Congress in [[Barcelona]], and "has confirmed an extinction crisis, with almost one in four [mammals] at risk of disappearing forever". The study shows at least 1,141 of the 5,487 mammals on Earth are known to be threatened with extinction, and 836 are listed as [[Data Deficient]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/red_list/index.cfm?uNewsID=1695 IUCN Red List reveals world’s mammals in crisis]&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{Anchor|Categories}}IUCN Red List Categories==
&lt;!--Linked from [[IUCN category]] and [[Template:Conservation status]]--&gt;
{{Conservation status}}

Species are classified by the IUCN Red List into nine groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authorlink= |title=Guidelines for Using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria |publisher=[[IUCN]] |date=March 2017 |version=Version 13 |url=http://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/RedListGuidelines.pdf |accessdate=2018-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; specified through criteria such as rate of decline, population size, area of geographic distribution, and degree of population and distribution fragmentation.

*[[Extinction|Extinct]] (EX) – beyond reasonable doubt that the species is no longer extant.
*[[Extinct in the wild]] (EW) – survives only in captivity, cultivation and/or outside native range, as presumed after exhaustive surveys.
*[[Critically endangered species|Critically endangered]] (CR) – in a particularly and extremely critical state.
*[[Endangered species|Endangered]] (EN) – very high risk of extinction in the wild, meets any of criteria A to E for Endangered.
*[[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] (VU) – meets one of the 5 red list criteria and thus considered to be at high risk of unnatural (human-caused) extinction without further human intervention.
*[[Near threatened]] (NT) – close to being at high risk of extinction in the near future.
*[[Least concern]] (LC) – unlikely to become extinct in the near future.
*[[Data deficient]] (DD) 
*[[Not evaluated]] (NE) 

In the IUCN Red List, "[[Threatened species|threatened]]" embraces the categories of Critically Endangered, Endangered, and Vulnerable.

===1994 categories and criteria===
The older 1994 has only a single "Lower Risk" category which contained three subcategories:

*[[Conservation Dependent]] (LR/cd)
*[[Near Threatened]] (LR/nt)
*[[Least Concern]] (LR/lc)

In the 2001 system Near Threatened and Least Concern have now become their own categories, while Conservation Dependent is no longer used and has been merged into Near Threatened.

===Possibly extinct===
The tag of "possibly extinct" (PE)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2752424/Going_or_gone_defining_Possibly_Extinct_species_to_give_a_truer_picture_of_recent_extinctions|title=Going or gone: defining 'Possibly Extinct' species to give a truer picture of recent extinctions|author=S. H. M. Butchart|format=pdf|work=Bull.

For plants, the 1997 Red List is the most important  source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Which IUCN list should I choose?|url=http://www.bgci.org/worldwide/which_iucn_list/|publisher=Botanic Gardens Conservation International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Image:Status iucn2.3.svg|thumb|alt=Icons for Red List categories|1994 IUCN Red List categories (version 2.3), used for species which have not been reassessed since 2001.]]
In 1997, the IUCN Red List came under criticism on the grounds of [[secrecy]] (or at least poor documentation) surrounding the sources of its data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = N. Mrosovsky| title = IUCN's credibility critically endangered| journal = Nature| volume = 389| issue = 6650| pages = 436| year = 1997| url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v389/n6650/abs/389436a0.html| doi = 10.1038/38873| bibcode = 1997Natur.389..436M}}&lt;/ref&gt; These allegations have led to efforts by the IUCN to improve its documentation and data quality, and to include peer reviews of taxa on the Red List. The list is also open to petitions against its classifications, on the basis of documentation or criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org//info/info_sources_quality |title=Information sources and quality |accessdate=19 September 2008 |work=IUCN Red List website |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917154041/http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/info_sources_quality |archivedate=17 September 2008 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' editorial defended the Red List's relevance in October 2008.&lt;ref name="Editors of Nature"&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7214 |pages=707–708 |date=9 October 2008 |title=The Red List still matters |doi=10.1038/455707b |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v455/n7214/full/455707b.html |pmid=18843306|bibcode=2008Natur.455R.707. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the IUCN Red List and similar works are prone to misuse by governments and other groups that draw possibly inappropriate conclusions on the state of the environment or to effect exploitation of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Hugh P. Possingham| title = Limits to the use of threatened species lists| journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution| volume = 17|issue=11| pages = 503–507|date=November 2002| doi = 10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02614-9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jack-frost.jpg|thumb|325px|19th-century cartoon depicting Jack Frost as a [[Major general (United States)|United States major-general]] during the [[American Civil War]]]]
'''Jack Frost''' is a [[personification]] of [[frost]], [[ice]], [[snow]], [[Rain and snow mixed|sleet]], [[winter]], and [[freezing]] [[cold]]. He is a variant of [[Deities and personifications of seasons#Winter|Old Man Winter]] who is held responsible for frosty weather, nipping the fingers and toes in such weather, coloring the foliage in autumn, and leaving fern-like patterns on cold windows in winter.

Starting in late 19th century literature, more developed characterizations of Jack Frost depict him as a [[sprite (entity)|sprite]]-like character, sometimes appearing as a sinister mischief-maker or as a hero.

==Background==
Jack Frost is traditionally said to leave the frosty, fern-like patterns on windows on cold winter mornings (window [[frost]] or fern frost) and nipping the extremities in cold weather. Over time, window frost has become far less prevalent in the modern world due to the advance of [[Insulated glazing|double-glazing]], but Jack Frost remains a well-known figure in popular culture.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2012|reason=I can find no solid sources for this claim; OED does not say anything about Jokul Frosti}}
He may originate from Anglo-Saxon and Norse winter customs and has an entire chapter named after him in Kalevala, the Finnish national epic compiled from their ancient oral tradition.

In Russia however, he has taken on a different form as Grandfather Frost, and in Germany there is instead a different entity altogether known as [[Frau Holle|Mrs. Holle]]. There are various other mythological beings who take on a similar role yet have different folklore to them.

Jack Frost has appeared as a character in television and movies. He was mentioned in the wintertime song "[[The Christmas Song]]" (aka "Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire"). He has been presented as a villain in some media and a hero in others.

His letters, essays, and books describing his adventures in nature, especially in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], have been read by millions. His activism has helped to preserve the [[Yosemite Valley]], [[Sequoia National Park]] and many other wilderness areas. The [[Sierra Club]], which he co-founded, is a prominent American [[conservation organization]]. The {{convert|211|mi|km|adj=on}} [[John Muir Trail]], a hiking trail in the Sierra Nevada, was named in his honor.&lt;ref name=Trail&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wenk|first1=Elizabeth|first2=Kathy|last2=Morey|title=John Muir Trail: The Essential Guide to Hiking America's Most Famous Trail|location=Berkeley, CA|publisher=[[Wilderness Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0899974361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other such places include [[Muir Woods National Monument]], [[Muir Beach]], [[John Muir College]], [[John Muir Charter School]], [[Mount Muir]], [[Camp Muir]], [[Muir Grove]], and [[Muir Glacier]]. In Scotland, the [[John Muir Way]], a 130-mile-long route, was named in honor of him.

In his later life, Muir devoted most of his time to the preservation of the Western forests. As part of the campaign to make Yosemite a national park, Muir published two landmark articles on wilderness preservation in ''[[The Century Magazine]]'', "The Treasures of the Yosemite" and "Features of the Proposed Yosemite National Park"; this helped support the push for [[U.S. Congress]] to pass a bill in 1890 establishing [[Yosemite National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress. [http://www.memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/cnchron3.html Documentary Chronology of Selected Events in the Development of the American Conservation Movement, 1847-1920].&lt;/ref&gt; The spiritual quality and enthusiasm toward nature expressed in his writings has inspired readers, including presidents and congressmen, to take action to help preserve large nature areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/john_muir_exhibit/life/|title=The Life and Contributions of John Muir |publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Muir has been considered "an inspiration to both Scots and Americans".&lt;ref name=MuirScotland&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scotland.org/features/john-muir-the-life-and-times|title=John Muir: The Life and Times |publisher=Scotland.org|date=27 April 2015 |access-date=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muir's biographer, Steven J. Holmes, believes that Muir has become "one of the patron saints of twentieth-century American environmental activity," both political and recreational. As a result, his writings are commonly discussed in books and journals, and he is often quoted by nature photographers such as [[Ansel Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ansel|title=America's Wilderness: the Photographs of Ansel Adams, with the Writings of John Muir|location=Philadelphia, PA|publisher=Courage Books|year=2002|isbn=978-0762413904}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Muir has profoundly shaped the very categories through which Americans understand and envision their relationships with the natural world," writes Holmes.&lt;ref name=Holmes/&gt;

Muir was noted for being an ecological thinker, political spokesman, and religious prophet, whose writings became a personal guide into nature for countless individuals, making his name "almost ubiquitous" in the modern environmental consciousness. According to author William Anderson, Muir exemplified "the archetype of our oneness with the earth",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=Anderson|title=Green Man: The Archetype of Our Oneness with the Earth|year=1998|isbn=978-0951703816}}&lt;/ref&gt; while biographer [[Donald Worster]] says he believed his mission was "saving the American soul from total surrender to materialism."&lt;ref name=Worster&gt;{{cite book|first=Donald|last=Worster| authorlink = Donald Worster|title=Passion for Nature|year=2008|isbn=978-0195166828}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|403}} On April 21, 2013, the first ever John Muir Day was celebrated in Scotland, which marked the 175th anniversary of his birth, paying homage to the conservationist.

==Early life==

===Boyhood in Scotland===

[[File:John Muir birthplace.jpg|thumb|alt=photo of John Muir's birthplace in Dunbar, Scotland|Muir was born in the small house at left. His father bought the adjacent building in 1842, and made it the family home.]]
[[John Muir's Birthplace]] is a four-story stone house in [[Dunbar]], East Lothian, Scotland. His parents were Daniel Muir and Ann Gilrye. He was the third of eight children: Margaret, Sarah, David, Daniel, Ann and Mary (twins), and the American-born Joanna. His earliest recollections were of taking short walks with his grandfather when he was three.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vault.sierraclub.org/john_muir_exhibit/writings/the_story_of_my_boyhood_and_youth/chapter_1.aspx A Boyhood in Scotland, Chapter 1, 'The Story of My Boyhood and Youth by John Muir' by John Muir (1913) - John Muir Exhibit (John Muir Education Project, Sierra Club California...&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, he described his boyhood pursuits, which included fighting, either by re-enacting romantic battles from the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] or just scrapping on the playground, and hunting for birds' nests (ostensibly to one-up his fellows as they compared notes on who knew where the most were located).&lt;ref name=Boyhood&gt;{{cite book|last=Muir|first=John|title=The Story of My Boyhood and Youth|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co.|year=1916|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FDsOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA25|isbn=978-1-883011-24-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25,37}} Author Amy Marquis notes that he began his "love affair" with nature while young, and implies that it may have been in reaction to his strict religious upbringing. "His father believed that anything that distracted from Bible studies was frivolous and punishable." But the young Muir was a "restless spirit" and especially "prone to lashings."&lt;ref name=Marquis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marquis|first=Amy Leinbach|date=Fall 2007|url=http://www.npca.org/magazine/2007/fall/a-mountain-calling.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yV7qVp6y?url=http://www.npca.org/magazine/2007/fall/a-mountain-calling.html|archivedate=May 7, 2011|title=A Mountain Calling|journal=National Parks Magazine|accessdate=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young boy, Muir became fascinated with the East Lothian landscape, and spent a lot of time wandering the local coastline and countryside. It was during this time that he became interested in natural history and the works of Scottish naturalist [[Alexander Wilson (ornithologist)|Alexander Wilson]].

Although he spent the majority of his life in America, Muir never forgot his roots in [[Scotland]]. He held a strong connection with his birthplace and Scottish identity throughout his life and was frequently heard talking about his childhood spent amid the East Lothian countryside. He greatly admired the works of [[Thomas Carlyle]] and poetry of [[Robert Burns]]; he was known to carry a collection of poems by Burns during his travels through the American wilderness. He returned to Scotland on a trip in 1893, where he met one of his Dunbar schoolmates and visited the places of his youth that were etched in his memory.&lt;ref name=MuirScotland/&gt; He also never lost his strong Scottish accent despite having lived in America for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Hutchings and John Miller (eds.). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9RiHDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22scottish%20accent%22&amp;f=false Transatlantic Literary Ecologies: Nature and Culture in the Nineteenth-Century Anglophone Atlantic World]''. New York: Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration to America===

In 1849, Muir's family immigrated to the United States, starting a farm near [[Portage, Wisconsin]], called [[Fountain Lake Farm]]. It has been designated a [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nhl/find/statelists/wi/WI.pdf |title=Listing of National Historic Landmarks by State |publisher=National Historic Landmarks Program |accessdate=April 13, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Fox (author/educator)|Stephen Fox]] recounts that Muir's father found the [[Church of Scotland]] insufficiently strict in faith and practice, leading to their immigration and joining a congregation of the [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Campbellite]] [[Restoration Movement]], called the [[Disciples of Christ (Campbell Movement)|Disciples of Christ]].&lt;ref name=GW&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Graham|chapter=Introduction|title=Journeys in the Wilderness, A John Muir Reader|publisher=Birlinn|year=2009|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-1841586977}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} By the age of 11, the young Muir had learned to recite "by heart and by sore flesh" all of the [[New Testament]] and most of the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Stephen R.|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|year=1985|isbn=978-0-299-10634-8|title=The American conservation movement : John Muir and his legacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}} In maturity, while remaining a deeply spiritual man, Muir may have changed his orthodox beliefs. He wrote, "I never tried to abandon creeds or code of civilization; they went away of their own accord ... without leaving any consciousness of loss." Elsewhere in his writings, he described the conventional image of a [[Creator deity|Creator]], "as purely a manufactured article as any puppet of a half-penny theater."&lt;ref name="Wolfe"&gt;{{cite book | title=Son of the Wilderness: The Life of John Muir | publisher=Alfred A. Knopf | last=Wolfe | first=Linnie Marsh | authorlink=Linnie Marsh Wolfe | year=1945|isbn=978-0299186340}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|95, 115}}
[[Image:JohnMuirFountianLakeFarm.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to [[Fountain Lake Farm]] near [[Portage, Wisconsin]]]]

When he was 22 years old, Muir enrolled at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], paying his own way for several years. There, under a towering [[Robinia pseudoacacia|black locust tree]] beside [[North Hall, University of Wisconsin|North Hall]], Muir took his first botany lesson. A fellow student plucked a flower from the tree and used it to explain how the grand locust is a member of the pea family, related to the straggling pea plant. Fifty years later, the naturalist Muir described the day in his autobiography. "This fine lesson charmed me and sent me flying to the woods and meadows in wild enthusiasm."&lt;ref name=Boyhood/&gt;{{rp|225}} As a freshman, Muir studied chemistry with [[Ezra S.

Records showed his class status as "irregular gent" and, even though he never graduated, he learned enough geology and botany to inform his later wanderings.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Rod|title=John Muir: Magnificent Tramp|location=New York|publisher=Forge|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7653-1071-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36}}

In 1863, his brother Daniel left Wisconsin and moved to [[Southern Ontario]] (then known as ''Canada West'' in the [[Province of Canada|United Canadas]]), to avoid the [[Conscription#American Civil War|draft]] during the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]]. Muir left school and travelled to the same region in 1864, and spent the spring, summer, and fall exploring the woods and swamps, and collecting plants around the southern reaches of [[Lake Huron]]'s [[Georgian Bay]].&lt;ref name=Worster/&gt;{{rp|85,92}} Muir hiked along the [[Niagara Escarpment]], including much of today's [[Bruce Trail]]. With his money running low and winter coming, he reunited with his brother Daniel near [[Meaford, Ontario]], who persuaded him to work with him at the sawmill and rake factory of William Trout and Charles Jay. Muir lived with the Trout family in an area called Trout Hollow, south of Meaford, on the [[Bighead River]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Paul|title=John Muir's Wild Years|url=https://www.mountainlifemedia.ca/2015/07/john-muirs-wild-years|accessdate=6 April 2018|work=Mountain Life|date=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he continued "botanizing", exploring the escarpment and bogs, collecting and cataloging plants.

In March 1866, Muir returned to the United States, settling in [[Indianapolis]] to work in a wagon wheel factory. He proved valuable to his employers because of his inventiveness in improving the machines and processes; he was promoted to supervisor, being paid $25 per week.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;{{rp|48}} In early-March 1867, an accident changed the course of his life: a tool he was using slipped and struck him in the eye.

When he did, "he saw the world—and his purpose—in a new light". Muir later wrote, "This affliction has driven me to the sweet fields. God has to nearly kill us sometimes, to teach us lessons."&lt;ref name=Marquis/&gt; From that point on, he determined to "be true to [himself]" and follow his dream of exploration and study of plants.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;{{rp|97}}

In September 1867, Muir undertook a walk of about {{convert|1000|mi|km}} from [[Kentucky]] to [[Florida]], which he recounted in his book ''A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf''. He had no specific route chosen, except to go by the "wildest, leafiest, and least trodden way I could find."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muir|first1=John|editor1-last=Badè|editor1-first=William Frederic|title=A Thousand-mile Walk to the Gulf|date=1916|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston and New York|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Hh4SAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=17 February 2017|page=xxxii}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Muir arrived at [[Cedar Key, Florida|Cedar Keys]], he began working for Richard Hodgson at Hodgson's sawmill. However, three days after accepting the job at Hodgson's, Muir almost died of a malarial sickness.

One evening in early January 1868, Muir climbed onto the Hodgson house roof to watch the sunset. He saw a ship, the Island Belle, and learned it would soon be sailing for [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Frederick W.|title=John Muir: Rediscovering America|location=Madison|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2000|isbn=9780738203751}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|150, 154}} Muir boarded the ship, and while in [[Havana]], he spent his hours studying shells and flowers and visiting the botanical garden in the city.&lt;ref name=Wilkins/&gt;{{rp|56}} Afterwards, he sailed to [[New York City]] and booked passage to [[California]].&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;{{rp|40–41}} Muir served as an officer in the [[United States Coast Survey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/staff/hist.html|title=History of Coast Survey|publisher=NOAA|work=Office of Coast Survey|language=en|access-date=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a uniformed government service agency.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==== Experiencing Yosemite ====
Finally settling in [[San Francisco]], Muir immediately left for a week-long visit to Yosemite, a place he had only read about. Seeing it for the first time, Muir notes that "He was overwhelmed by the landscape, scrambling down steep cliff faces to get a closer look at the waterfalls, whooping and howling at the vistas, jumping tirelessly from flower to flower."&lt;ref name=Marquis/&gt; He later returned to Yosemite and worked as a shepherd for a season. He climbed a number of mountains, including [[Cathedral Peak (California)|Cathedral Peak]] and [[Mount Dana]], and hiked an old trail down Bloody Canyon to [[Mono Lake]].

Muir built a small cabin along [[Yosemite Creek]],&lt;ref name=NationalParks/&gt;{{rp|207}} designing it so that a section of the stream flowed through a corner of the room so he could enjoy the sound of running water. He lived in the cabin for two years&lt;ref name=Teale&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muir|first1=John|last2=Teale|first2=Edwin Way|title=The Wilderness World of John Muir|publisher=Mariner Books|year=1954|isbn=978-0618127511}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|143}} and wrote about this period in his book ''First Summer in the Sierra'' (1911). Muir's biographer, Frederick Turner, notes Muir's journal entry upon first visiting the valley and writes that his description "blazes from the page with the authentic force of a conversion experience."&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt;{{rp|172}}

==== Friendships ====
During these years in Yosemite, Muir was unmarried, often unemployed, with no prospects for a career, and had "periods of anguish," writes naturalist author [[John Tallmadge]]. He did marry in 1880 to Louisa Strentzel.  He went into business for 10 years with his father-in-law managing the orchards on the family 2600 acre farm near Oakland. John and Louisa had two daughters. He was sustained by the natural environment and by reading the essays of naturalist author [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], who wrote about the very life that Muir was then living. On excursions into the back country of Yosemite, he traveled alone, carrying "only a tin cup, a handful of tea, a loaf of bread, and a copy of Emerson."&lt;ref name=Tallmadge&gt;{{cite book|last=Tallmadge|first=John|title=Meeting the Tree of Life: A Teacher's Path|publisher=Univ. of Utah Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0874805314}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52–53}} He usually spent his evenings sitting by a campfire in his overcoat, reading Emerson under the stars. As the years passed, he became a "fixture in the valley," respected for his knowledge of natural history, his skill as a guide, and his vivid storytelling.&lt;ref name=Tallmadge/&gt;{{rp|53}} Visitors to the valley often included scientists, artists, and celebrities, many of whom made a point of meeting with Muir.

In 1871, after Muir had lived in Yosemite for three years, Emerson, with a number of academic friends from [[Boston]], arrived in Yosemite during a tour of the [[Western United States]]. The two men met, and according to Tallmadge, "Emerson was delighted to find at the end of his career the prophet-naturalist he had called for so long ago ... And for Muir, Emerson's visit came like a laying on of hands."&lt;ref name=Tallmadge/&gt;{{rp|53}} Emerson spent one day with Muir, and he offered him a teaching position at Harvard, which Muir declined. Muir later wrote, "I never for a moment thought of giving up God's big show for a mere profship!"&lt;ref name=Tallmadge/&gt;{{rp|53}}

Muir also spent time with photographer [[Carleton Watkins]] and studied his photographs of Yosemite.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/dec/30/carleton-watkins-photographs-saved-yosemite Carleton Watkins photographs saved Yosemite] December 20, 2011 Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Geological studies and theories ====
[[Image:John Muir Cane.JPG|thumb|left|upright|John Muir in 1907]]
Pursuit of his love of science, especially geology, often occupied his free time. Muir soon became convinced that [[glacier]]s had sculpted many of the features of the Yosemite Valley and surrounding area. This notion was in stark contradiction to the accepted contemporary theory, promulgated by [[Josiah Whitney]] (head of the [[California Geological Survey]]), which attributed the formation of the valley to a catastrophic [[earthquake]]. As Muir's ideas spread, Whitney tried to discredit Muir by branding him as an amateur. But [[Louis Agassiz]], the premier geologist of the day, saw merit in Muir's ideas and lauded him as "the first man I have ever found who has any adequate conception of glacial action."&lt;ref name="glacial-action"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry Gifford (re.)|title=The life and letters of John Muir|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=v5gBcjZkQ5IC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA322#v=onepage&amp;q=|year=1996|publisher=The Mountaineers Books|page=322|chapter=Trees and Travel|quote=Letter to Robert Underwood Johnson; Martinez, 3 March 1895|isbn=9780898864632}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1871, Muir discovered an active alpine glacier below [[Merced Peak]], which helped his theories gain acceptance.

A large [[1872 Lone Pine earthquake|earthquake centered near Lone Pine]] in [[Owens Valley]] strongly shook occupants of Yosemite Valley in March 1872. The quake woke Muir in the early morning, and he ran out of his cabin "both glad and frightened," exclaiming, "A noble earthquake!" Other valley settlers, who believed Whitney's ideas, feared that the quake was a prelude to a cataclysmic deepening of the valley. Muir had no such fear and promptly made a moonlit survey of new [[scree|talus]] piles created by earthquake-triggered rockslides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://vault.sierraclub.org/john_muir_exhibit/writings/our_national_parks/ |chapterurl=http://vault.sierraclub.org/john_muir_exhibit/writings/the_earthquake.aspx|title=Our National Parks |chapter=The Earthquake|publisher=[[Sierra Club]]|author=Muir, John|year=1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event led more people to believe in Muir's ideas about the formation of the valley.

==== Botanical studies ====
In addition to his geologic studies, Muir also investigated the plant life of the Yosemite area. In 1873 and 1874, he made field studies along the western flank of the Sierra on the distribution and ecology of isolated groves of [[Giant Sequoia]]. In 1876, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] published Muir's paper on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science|title=On the Post-glacial History of Sequoia Gigantea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BbEZAAAAYAAJ|volume=25|date=August 1876|pages=242–252|last1=Muir|first1=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific Northwest===
Muir made four trips to [[Alaska]], as far as [[Unalaska, Alaska|Unalaska]] and [[Barrow, Alaska|Barrow]].&lt;ref&gt;Muir, John, (1915) ''Travels in Alaska''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin..&lt;/ref&gt; Muir, Mr Young (Fort Wrangell missionary) and a group of Native American Guides first traveled to Alaska in 1879 and were the first Euro-Americans&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=John Muir |title=Travels in Alaska |chapter=Chapter X: The Discovery of Glacier Bay |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |year=1915 |chapter-url=http://vault.sierraclub.org/john_muir_exhibit/writings/travels_in_alaska/chapter_10.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt; to explore [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve|Glacier Bay]]. Muir Glacier was later named after him. He traveled into [[British Columbia]] a third of the way up the [[Stikine River]], likening its [[Grand Canyon of the Stikine|Grand Canyon]] to "a Yosemite that was a hundred miles long".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://infoaboutalaska.com/WordPress/natural-history/john-muir-comes-to-alaska/ |title=John Muir Comes to Alaska | publisher=Information About Alaska (IAA) |author=Sorum, Alan |date=September 30, 2007 |accessdate=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muir recorded over 300 glaciers along the river's course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0403/feature5/fulltext.html |title=Deep North | work=National Geographic Magazine |publisher=National Geographic Society |author=Davis, Wade |date=March 2004 |accessdate=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned for further explorations in southeast Alaska in 1880 and in 1881 was with the party that landed on [[Wrangel Island]] on the [[USRC Thomas Corwin (1876)|USS ''Corwin'']] and claimed that island for the United States. He documented this experience in journal entries and newspaper articles—later compiled and edited into his book ''The Cruise of the Corwin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/john_muir_writings/the_cruise_of_the_corwin/introduction.html| title=The Cruise of the Corwin| author=John Muir|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company| location=Boston and New York| year=1917| accessdate=September 5, 2008|isbn=978-1140210405}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888 after seven years of managing the Strentzel fruit ranch in [[Alhambra Valley, California]], his health began to suffer. He returned to the hills to recover, climbing [[Mount Rainier]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and writing ''Ascent of Mount Rainier''.

==Activism and controversies==

===Preservation efforts===
[[File:Valley View Yosemite August 2013 002.jpg|thumb|Yosemite Valley and the [[Merced River]]]]

====Establishing Yosemite National Park====
Muir threw himself into the preservationist role with great vigor. He envisioned the Yosemite area and the Sierra as pristine lands.&lt;ref name="proposed"&gt;{{cite journal|first=John|last=Muir| title=Features of the Proposed Yosemite National Park| url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/john_muir_writings/features_of_the_proposed_yosemite_national_park/| journal=The Century Magazine| issue= 5|date=September 1890| accessdate=April 8, 2007| volume=XL}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought the greatest threat to the Yosemite area and the Sierra was domesticated livestock—especially domestic sheep, which he referred to as "hoofed locusts". In June 1889, the influential associate editor of ''The Century'' magazine, [[Robert Underwood Johnson]], camped with Muir in [[Tuolumne Meadows]] and saw firsthand the damage a large flock of sheep had done to the grassland. Johnson agreed to publish any article Muir wrote on the subject of excluding livestock from the Sierra high country. He also agreed to use his influence to introduce a bill to Congress to make the Yosemite area into a national park, modeled after [[Yellowstone National Park]].

On September 30, 1890, the U.S. Congress passed a bill that essentially followed recommendations that Muir had suggested in two ''Century'' articles, "The Treasures of the Yosemite" and "Features of the Proposed National Park", both published in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;John Muir. "[http://www.yosemite.ca.us/john_muir_writings/the_treasures_of_the_yosemite/ The Treasures of the Yosemite]". ''The Century Magazine'', vol. 40, no. 4 (August, 1890).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="proposed"/&gt; But to Muir's dismay, the bill left Yosemite Valley under state control, as it had been since the 1860s.

===Co-founding the Sierra Club===
{{Main|Sierra Club}}
In early 1892, Professor Henry Senger, a philologist at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], contacted Muir with the idea of forming a local 'alpine club' for mountain lovers. Senger and San Francisco attorney Warren Olney sent out invitations "for the purpose of forming a 'Sierra Club.' Mr. John Muir will preside." On May 28, 1892, the first meeting of the [[Sierra Club]] was held to write articles of incorporation. One week later Muir was elected president, Warren Olney was elected vice-president, and a board of directors was chosen that included [[David Starr Jordan]], president of the new [[Stanford University]]. Muir remained president until his death 22 years later.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;{{rp|107–108}}&lt;ref name="Colby"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.owensvalleyhistory.com/stories1/story_of_sierra_club.pdf|title=The Story of the Sierra Club|last=Colby|first=William|date=December 1967|work=Sierra Club Bulletin|publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=February 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sierra Club immediately opposed efforts to reduce [[Yosemite National Park]] by half, and began holding educational and scientific meetings. At one meeting in the fall of 1895 that included Muir, [[Joseph LeConte]], and William R. Dudley, the Sierra Club discussed the idea of establishing 'national forest reservations', which were later called [[United States National Forest|National Forests]]. The Sierra Club was active in the successful campaign to transfer Yosemite National Park from state to federal control in 1906. The fight to preserve Hetch Hetchy Valley was also taken up by the Sierra Club, with some prominent San Francisco members opposing the fight. Eventually a vote was held that overwhelmingly put the Sierra Club behind the opposition to Hetch Hetchy Dam.&lt;ref name="Colby"/&gt;

===Preservation vs conservation===
In July 1896, Muir became associated with [[Gifford Pinchot]], a national leader in the [[Conservation in the United States|conservation]] movement. Pinchot was the first head of the [[United States Forest Service]] and a leading spokesman for the sustainable use of natural resources for the benefit of the people. His views eventually clashed with Muir's and highlighted two diverging views of the use of the country's natural resources. Pinchot saw conservation as a means of managing the nation's natural resources for long-term sustainable commercial use. As a professional forester, his view was that "forestry is tree farming," without destroying the long-term viability of the forests.&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=John M.|date=Winter 1997|title=Gifford Pinchot, John Muir, and the Boundaries of Politics in American Thought|journal=Polity|volume=30|issue=2|pages=267–284|doi=10.2307/3235219|jstor=3235219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muir valued nature for its spiritual and transcendental qualities. In one essay about the National Parks, he referred to them as "places for rest, inspiration, and prayers." He often encouraged city dwellers to experience nature for its spiritual nourishment. Both men opposed reckless exploitation of natural resources, including clear-cutting of forests. Even Muir acknowledged the need for timber and the forests to provide it, but Pinchot's view of wilderness management was more resource-oriented.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt;

Their friendship ended late in the summer of 1897 when Pinchot released a statement to a [[Seattle]] newspaper supporting sheep grazing in forest reserves. Muir confronted Pinchot and demanded an explanation. When Pinchot reiterated his position, Muir told him: "I don't want any thing more to do with you." This philosophical divide soon expanded and split the conservation movement into two camps: the preservationists, led by Muir; and Pinchot's camp, who co-opted the term "conservation." The two men debated their positions in popular magazines, such as ''Outlook'', ''Harper's Weekly'', ''Atlantic Monthly'', ''World's Work'', and ''Century''. Their contrasting views were highlighted again when the United States was deciding whether to dam [[Hetch Hetchy Valley]]. Pinchot favored damming the valley as "the highest possible use which could be made of it." In contrast, Muir proclaimed, "Dam Hetch Hetchy! As well dam for water-tanks the people's cathedrals and churches, for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the hearts of man."&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt;

[[Image:Muir and Roosevelt restored.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Theodore Roosevelt]] and Muir, 1906]]
In 1899, Muir accompanied railroad executive [[E. H. Harriman]] and esteemed scientists on the famous [[Harriman Alaska Expedition|exploratory voyage]] along the Alaska coast aboard the luxuriously refitted {{convert|250|ft|m|0|adj=on}} steamer, the ''George W. Elder.'' He later relied on his friendship with Harriman to pressure Congress to pass conservation legislation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In 1903, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] accompanied Muir on a visit to Yosemite. Muir joined Roosevelt in [[Oakland, California]], for the train trip to [[Raymond, California|Raymond]]. The presidential entourage then traveled by [[stagecoach]] into the park. While traveling to the park, Muir told the president about state mismanagement of the valley and rampant exploitation of the valley's resources. Even before they entered the park, he was able to convince Roosevelt that the best way to protect the valley was through federal control and management.

After entering the park and seeing the magnificent splendor of the valley, the president asked Muir to show him the real Yosemite. Muir and Roosevelt set off largely by themselves and camped in the back country. The duo talked late into the night, slept in the brisk open air of Glacier Point, and were dusted by a fresh snowfall in the morning. It was a night Roosevelt never forgot.&lt;ref name = "Nash"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Roderick|title=Wilderness &amp; The American Mind|year=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|location=Yale University|isbn=978-0-300-09122-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rinde|first1=Meir|title=Richard Nixon and the Rise of American Environmentalism |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1|pages=16–29|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/richard-nixon-and-the-rise-of-american-environmentalism|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later told a crowd, "Lying out at night under those giant Sequoias was like lying in a temple built by no hand of man, a temple grander than any human architect could by any possibility build."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Camping With John and Teddy|url= https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2018/8/23/camping-with-john-and-teddy |website=The Attic|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muir, too, cherished the camping trip. "Camping with the President was a remarkable experience," he wrote. "I fairly fell in love with him."&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muir then increased efforts by the [[Sierra Club]] to consolidate park management. In 1906 Congress transferred the [[Mariposa Grove]] and Yosemite Valley to the park.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Native Americans===
Muir's attitude toward [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] evolved over his life. His earliest encounters, during his childhood in Wisconsin, were with [[Winnebago Indians]], who begged for food and stole his favorite horse. In spite of that, he had a great deal of sympathy for their "being robbed of their lands and pushed ruthlessly back into narrower and narrower limits by alien races who were cutting off their means of livelihood." His early encounters with the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] in California left him feeling ambivalent after seeing their lifestyle, which he described as "lazy" and "superstitious".&lt;ref name="Fleck"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fleck|first=Richard F. |date=February 1978|title=John Muir's Evolving Attitudes toward Native American Cultures|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=4|issue=1|pages=19–31|doi=10.2307/1183963|jstor=1183963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecofeminist philosopher [[Carolyn Merchant]] has criticized Muir, believing that he wrote disparagingly of the Native Americans he encountered in his early explorations.&lt;ref name=Merchant&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&amp;url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/eh/8.3/merchant.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yV7qrYMe?url=http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&amp;url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/eh/8.3/merchant.html |archivedate=May 7, 2011 |title=Shades of Darkness: Race and Environmental History |author=[[Carolyn Merchant]] |accessdate=June 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, after living with Indians, he praised and grew more respectful of their low impact on the wilderness, compared to the heavy impact by European-Americans.&lt;ref name=Summer/&gt;

Muir was given the Stickeen (Muir's spelling, coastal tribe) name "Ancoutahan" meaning "adopted chief".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Muir|title=Travels in Alaska|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ssd5AAAAMAAJ|year=1915|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hetch Hetchy dam controversy===
[[File:Hetch Hetchy Valley.jpg|thumb|right|Hetch Hetchy Valley]]
With population growth continuing in San Francisco, political pressure increased to dam the [[Tuolumne River]] for use as a water [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]]. Muir passionately opposed the damming of [[Hetch Hetchy Valley]] because he found Hetch Hetchy as stunning as Yosemite Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muir|first=John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vl4AAAAAYAAJ|title=The Yosemite|location=New York|publisher=The Century Company|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|249–62}} Muir, the Sierra Club and Robert Underwood Johnson fought against inundating the valley. Muir wrote to President Roosevelt pleading for him to scuttle the project. Roosevelt's successor, [[William Howard Taft]], suspended the [[Interior Department]]'s approval for the Hetch Hetchy right-of-way. After years of national debate, Taft's successor [[Woodrow Wilson]] signed the bill authorizing the dam into law on December 19, 1913. Muir felt a great loss from the destruction of the valley, his last major battle. He wrote to his friend [[Vernon Kellogg]], "As to the loss of the Sierra Park Valley [Hetch Hetchy] it's hard to bear. The destruction of the charming groves and gardens, the finest in all California, goes to my heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Holway R|year=1965|title=John Muir and the Sierra Club: the Battle for Yosemite|location=San Francisco|publisher=Sierra Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature writer==
[[Image:Lake Tenaka.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;[[Lake Tenaya]], Yosemite&lt;/center&gt;]]
In his life, Muir published six volumes of writings, all describing explorations of natural settings. Four additional books were published posthumously. Several books were subsequently published that collected essays and articles from various sources. Miller writes that what was most important about his writings was not their quantity, but their "quality". He notes that they have had a "lasting effect on American culture in helping to create the desire and will to protect and preserve wild and natural environments."&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;{{rp|173}}

His first appearance in print was by accident, writes Miller; a person he did not know submitted, without his permission or awareness, a personal letter to his friend Jeanne Carr, describing [[Calypso (orchid)|''Calypso borealis'']], a rare flower he had encountered. The piece was published anonymously, identified as having been written by an "inspired pilgrim".&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;{{rp|174}} Throughout his many years as a nature writer, Muir frequently rewrote and expanded on earlier writings from his journals, as well as articles published in magazines. He often compiled and organized such earlier writings as collections of essays or included them as part of narrative books.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;{{rp|173}}

===Jeanne Carr: friend and mentor===
Muir's friendship with Jeanne Carr had a lifelong influence on his career as a naturalist and writer. They first met in the fall of 1860, when, at age 22, he entered a number of his homemade inventions in the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society Fair. Carr, a fair assistant, was asked by fair officials to review Muir's exhibits to see if they had merit. She thought they did and "saw in his entries evidence of genius worthy of special recognition," notes Miller.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;{{rp|33}} As a result, Muir received a diploma and a monetary award for his handmade clocks and [[thermometer]].&lt;ref name=Gisel/&gt;{{rp|1}} During the next three years while a student at the University of Wisconsin, he was befriended by Carr and her husband, [[Ezra S. Carr|Ezra]], a professor at the same university. According to Muir biographer Bonnie Johanna Gisel, the Carrs recognized his "pure mind, unsophisticated nature, inherent curiosity, scholarly acumen, and independent thought." Jeanne Carr, 35 years of age, especially appreciated his youthful individuality, along with his acceptance of "religious truths" that were much like her own.&lt;ref name=Gisel&gt;{{cite book|last=Gisel|first=Bonnie Johanna|title=Kindred &amp; Related Spirits: The Letters of John Muir and Jeanne C. Carr|publisher=Univ. of Utah Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0874806823}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

[[Image:John Muir NHS.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[John Muir National Historic Site|Muirs' home]] in [[Martinez, California]], is a National Historic Site.]]
Muir was often invited to the Carrs' home; he shared Jeanne's love of plants. In 1864, he left Wisconsin to begin exploring the Canadian wilderness and, while there, began corresponding with her about his activities. Carr wrote Muir in return and encouraged him in his explorations and writings, eventually having an important influence over his personal goals. At one point she asked Muir to read a book she felt would influence his thinking, [[Lamartine]]'s ''The Stonemason of Saint Point''. It was the story of a man whose life she hoped would "metabolize in Muir," writes Gisel, and "was a projection of the life she envisioned for him." According to Gisel, the story was about a "poor man with a pure heart," who found in nature "divine lessons and saw all of God's creatures interconnected."&lt;ref name=Gisel/&gt;{{rp|3}}

After Muir returned to the United States, he spent the next four years exploring Yosemite, while at the same time writing articles for publication. During those years, Muir and Carr continued corresponding. She sent many of her friends to Yosemite to meet Muir and "to hear him preach the gospel of the mountains," writes Gisel. The most notable was naturalist and author [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. The importance of Carr, who continually gave Muir reassurance and inspiration, "cannot be overestimated," adds Gisel. It was "through his letters to her that he developed a voice and purpose." She also tried to promote Muir's writings by submitting his letters to a monthly magazine for publication. Muir came to trust Carr as his "spiritual mother," and they remained friends for 30 years.&lt;ref name=Gisel/&gt;{{rp|6}} In one letter she wrote to Muir while he was living in Yosemite, she tried to keep him from despairing as to his purpose in life.&lt;ref name=Gisel/&gt;{{rp|43}}

The value of their friendship was first disclosed by a friend of Carr's, clergyman and writer G. Wharton James. After obtaining copies of their private letters from Carr, and despite pleadings from Muir to return them, he instead published articles about their friendship, using those letters as a primary source. In one such article, his focus was Muir's debt to Carr, stating that she was his "guiding star" who "led him into the noble paths of life, and then kept him there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Sally M|last2=Morrison|first2=Daryl|title=John Muir: Family, Friends, and Adventures|publisher=Univ. of New Mexico Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0826335302}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87–88}}

===Writing becomes his work===
Muir's friend, zoologist [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], writes that Muir's style of writing did not come to him easily, but only with intense effort. "Daily he rose at 4:30 o'clock, and after a simple cup of coffee labored incessantly. ... he groans over his labors, he writes and rewrites and interpolates." Osborn notes that he preferred using the simplest English language, and therefore admired above all the writings of [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] and [[Thoreau]]. "He is a very firm believer in Thoreau and starts by reading deeply of this author."&lt;ref name=Bulletin&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/john_muir_exhibit/life/scb_jm_memorial_1916.aspx|title=John Muir Memorial|journal=Sierra Club Bulletin|volume=10|date=January 1916|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} His secretary, Marion Randall Parsons, also noted that "composition was always slow and laborious for him. ... Each sentence, each phrase, each word, underwent his critical scrutiny, not once but twenty times before he was satisfied to let it stand." Muir often told her, "This business of writing books is a long, tiresome, endless job."&lt;ref name=Bulletin/&gt;{{rp|33}}

Miller speculates that Muir recycled his earlier writings partly due to his "dislike of the writing process." He adds that Muir "did not enjoy the work, finding it difficult and tedious." He was generally unsatisfied with the finished result, finding prose "a weak instrument for the reality he wished to convey."&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;{{rp|173}} However, he was prodded by friends and his wife to keep writing and as a result of their influence he kept at it, although never satisfied. Muir wrote in 1872, "No amount of word-making will ever make a single soul to 'know' these mountains. One day's exposure to mountains is better than a cartload of books."&lt;ref name=Alaska&gt;{{cite book|last=Muir|first=John|title=Travels in Alaska|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xviii}} In one of his essays, he gave an example of the deficiencies of writing versus experiencing nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muir|first=John|title=The Writings of John Muir: Steep Trails|editor-first=Marion|editor-last=Parsons|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1918|isbn=978-1605977164}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|321}}

==Philosophical beliefs==

===Of Nature and Theology===
Muir believed that to discover truth, he must turn to what he believed were the most accurate sources. Muir had a strict, Scottish [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] upbringing. In his book, ''The Story of My Boyhood and Youth'' (1913), he writes that during his childhood, his father made him read the Bible every day. Muir eventually memorized three-quarters of the [[Old Testament]] and all of the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref name=Boyhood/&gt;{{rp|20}} Muir's father read [[Josephus]]'s ''War of the Jews'' to understand the culture of first-century [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], as it was written by an eyewitness, and illuminated the culture during the period of the New Testament.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Denis C|title=God's Wilds: John Muir's Vision of Nature|location=College Station|publisher=Texas A&amp;M Univ. Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1585441433}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}} But as Muir became attached to the American natural landscapes he explored, Williams notes that he began to see another "primary source for understanding God: the Book of Nature." According to Williams, in nature, especially in the wilderness, Muir was able to study the plants and animals in an environment that he believed "came straight from the hand of God, uncorrupted by civilization and domestication."&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;{{rp|43}} As Tallmadge notes, Muir's belief in this "Book of Nature" compelled him to tell the story of "this creation in words any reader could understand." As a result, his writings were to become "prophecy, for [they] sought to change our angle of vision."&lt;ref name=Tallmadge/&gt;{{rp|53}}

Williams notes that Muir's philosophy and world view rotated around his perceived dichotomy between civilization and nature. From this developed his core belief that "wild is superior".&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;{{rp|41}} His nature writings became a "synthesis of natural theology" with scripture that helped him understand the origins of the natural world. According to Williams, philosophers and theologians such as [[Thomas Dick (scientist)|Thomas Dick]] suggested that the "best place to discover the true attributes of deity was in Nature." He came to believe that God was always active in the creation of life and thereby kept the natural order of the world.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;{{rp|41}} As a result, Muir "styled himself as a [[John the Baptist]]," adds Williams, "whose duty was to immerse in 'mountain baptism' everyone he could."&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;{{rp|46}} Williams concludes that Muir saw nature as a great teacher, "revealing the mind of God," and this belief became the central theme of his later journeys and the "subtext" of his nature writing.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;{{rp|50}}

During his career as writer and while living in the mountains, Muir continued to experience the "presence of the divine in nature," writes Holmes&lt;ref name=Holmes/&gt;{{rp|5}}&lt;ref name=Mountains/&gt;{{rp|317}} His personal letters also conveyed these feelings of ecstasy. Historian Catherine Albanese stated that in one of his letters, "Muir's [[eucharist]] made [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau's]] feast on wood-chuck and huckleberry seem almost anemic." Muir was extremely fond of Thoreau and was probably influenced more by him than even [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]. Muir often referred to himself as a "disciple" of Thoreau.&lt;ref name=Albanese&gt;{{cite book|last=Albanese|first=Catherine L|title=Nature Religion in America: From the Algonkian Indians to the New Age|location=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|100}}

===Of sensory perceptions and light===
[[File:Yosemite rocks.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Yosemite scene&lt;/center&gt;]]
During his first summer in the Sierra as a shepherd, Muir wrote field notes that emphasized the role that the senses play in human perceptions of the environment. According to Williams, he speculated that the world was an unchanging entity that was interpreted by the brain through the senses, and, writes Muir, "If the creator were to bestow a new set of senses upon us ... we would never doubt that we were in another world ..."&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;{{rp|43}} While doing his studies of nature, he would try to remember everything he observed as if his senses were recording the impressions, until he could write them in his journal. As a result of his intense desire to remember facts, he filled his field journals with notes on precipitation, temperature, and even cloud formations.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;{{rp|45}}

However, Muir took his journal entries further than recording factual observations. Williams notes that the observations he recorded amounted to a description of "the sublimity of Nature," and what amounted to "an aesthetic and spiritual notebook." Muir felt that his task was more than just recording "phenomena," but also to "illuminate the spiritual implications of those phenomena," writes Williams. For Muir, mountain skies, for example, seemed painted with light, and came to "... symbolize divinity."&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;{{rp|45}} He often described his observations in terms of light.&lt;ref name=Summer/&gt;

Muir biographer Steven Holmes notes that Muir used words like "glory" and "glorious" to suggest that light was taking on a religious dimension: "It is impossible to overestimate the importance of the notion of glory in Muir's published writings, where no other single image carries more emotional or religious weight,"&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Steven|title=The Young John Muir: An Environmental Biography|location=Madison|publisher=Univ. of Wisconsin Press|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|178}} adding that his words "exactly parallels its [[Hebraic]] origins," in which biblical writings often indicate a divine presence with light, as in the [[burning bush]] or [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]], and described as "the glory of God."&lt;ref name=Holmes/&gt;{{rp|179}}&lt;ref name=Summer&gt;{{cite book|last=Muir|first=John|title=My First Summer in the Sierra|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1911|isbn=978-0618988518}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|115}}&lt;ref name=Mountains&gt;{{cite book|last=Muir|first=John|title=John of the Mountains: the Unpublished Journals of John Muir|editor1-last=Wolfe|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1938|editor-first=Linnie Marsh|isbn=978-0299078843}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}}

===Seeing nature as home===
[[Image:John Muir at National Portrait Gallery IMG 4581.JPG|right|thumb|Posthumous portrait by Orlando Rouland (1917)&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, Antonette (2012) [http://npg.si.edu/blog/portrait-prophet-orlando-rouland%E2%80%99s-john-muir-1917 Portrait of a Prophet: Orlando Rouland’s John Muir, 1917]. National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Muir often used the term "home" as a metaphor for both nature and his general attitude toward the "natural world itself," notes Holmes. He often used domestic language to describe his scientific observations, as when he saw nature as providing a home for even the smallest plant life: "the little purple plant, tended by its Maker, closed its petals, crouched low in its crevice of a home, and enjoyed the storm in safety."&lt;ref name=Mountains/&gt;{{rp|57}} Muir also saw nature as his own home, as when he wrote friends and described the Sierra as "God's mountain mansion." He considered not only the mountains as home, however, as he also felt a closeness even to the smallest objects: "The very stones seem talkative, sympathetic, brotherly. No wonder when we consider that we all have the same Father and Mother."&lt;ref name=Summer/&gt;{{rp|319}}

In his later years, he used the metaphor of nature as home in his writings to promote wilderness preservation.&lt;ref name=NationalParks&gt;{{cite book|last=Muir|first=John|title=Our National Parks|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1901|isbn=978-1177228756}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}

Not surprisingly, Muir's deep-seated feeling about nature as being his true home led to tension with his family at his home in Martinez, California. He once told a visitor to his ranch there, "This is a good place to be housed in during stormy weather, ... to write in, and to raise children in, but it is not my home. Up there," pointing towards the Sierra Nevada, "is my home."&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;{{rp|74}}

==Personal life==
[[File:Muir &amp; family c1888.jpg|thumb|Muir and family circa 1888.]]
In 1878, when he was nearing the age of 40, Muir's friends "pressured him to return to society."&lt;ref name=Marquis/&gt; Soon after he returned to the Oakland area, he was introduced by Jeanne Carr to Louisa Strentzel, daughter of a prominent physician and [[horticulture|horticulturist]] with a {{convert|2600|acre|km2|adj=on}} fruit orchard in [[Martinez, California]], northeast of Oakland. In 1880, after he returned from a trip to Alaska, Muir and Strentzel married. John Muir went into partnership with his father-in-law, Dr. [[John Strentzel]], and for ten years directed most of his energy into managing this large fruit ranch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/john_muir_exhibit/john_muir_national_historic_site/most_often_asked_questions.aspx|title=Most Often Asked Questions at the John Muir National Historic Site|publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Muir was a loyal, dedicated husband, and father of two daughters,"his heart remained wild," writes Marquis. His wife understood his needs, and after seeing his restlessness at the ranch would sometimes "shoo him back up" to the mountains. He sometimes took his daughters with him.&lt;ref name=Marquis/&gt;

The house and part of the ranch are now the [[John Muir National Historic Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/jomu/index.htm John Muir National Historic Site]
"The park's museum collection includes historic documents and artifacts that relate to the writing, travels, political activities and daily life of John Muir and his family in Martinez ... The collections are displayed in the home, carriage house and through exhibitions in the Visitor Center."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[W.H.C. Folsom House]], where Muir worked as a printer, is also listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==Legacy==
[[Image:Muir LOC1.jpg|thumb|upright|A portrait of Muir, circa 1910]]
During his lifetime John Muir published over 300 articles and 12 books. He co-founded the [[Sierra Club]], which helped establish a number of national parks after he died. Today the club has over 2.4&amp;nbsp;million members.

Muir has been called the "patron saint of the American wilderness" and its "archetypal free spirit." As a dreamer and activist, his eloquent words changed the way Americans saw their mountains, forests, seashores, and deserts, said nature writer [[Gretel Ehrlich]].&lt;ref name=Ehrlich&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrlich|first=Gretel|title=John Muir: Nature's Visionary|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=National Geographic Society|year=2000|oclc=248316300}}&lt;/ref&gt; He not only led the efforts to protect forest areas and have some designated as national parks, but his writings presented "human culture and wild nature as one of humility and respect for all life."&lt;ref name=Wilkins/&gt;

[[Robert Underwood Johnson]], editor of ''Century Magazine'', which published many of Muir's articles, states that he influenced people's appreciation of nature and national parks, which became a lasting legacy:

{{quote|The world will look back to the time we live in and remember the voice of one crying in the wilderness and bless the name of John Muir. ... He sung the glory of nature like another Psalmist, and, as a true artist, was unashamed of his emotions. His countrymen owe him gratitude as the pioneer of our system of national parks. ... Muir's writings and enthusiasm were the chief forces that inspired the movement. All the other torches were lighted from his.&lt;ref name=Bulletin/&gt;}}

Muir exalted wild nature over human culture and civilization, believing that all life was sacred. Turner describes him as "a man who in his singular way rediscovered America. ... an American pioneer, an American hero."&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt; The primary aim of Muir's nature philosophy, writes Wilkins, was to challenge mankind's "enormous conceit," and in so doing, he moved beyond the [[Transcendentalism]] of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] to a "biocentric perspective on the world". He did so by describing the natural world as "a conductor of divinity," and his writings often made nature synonymous with God.&lt;ref name=Wilkins&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkins|first=Thurman|title=John Muir: Apostle of Nature|location=Norman|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0806127972}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|265}} His friend, [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], observed that as a result of his religious upbringing, Muir retained "this belief, which is so strongly expressed in the [[Old Testament]], that all the works of nature are directly the work of God."&lt;ref name=Bulletin/&gt; In the opinion of [[Enos Mills]], a contemporary who established [[Rocky Mountain National Park]], Muir's writings would "likely to be the most influential force in this century."&lt;ref name=Bulletin/&gt;

== Background ==
''Kangaroo'' began as an interest to delve deeper into the spilt opinion concerning the animal, with Kate McIntyre Clere saying that they were surprised to learn just how many kangaroos are shot and sold for profit each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://screen-space.squarespace.com/features/2018/3/20/kangaroo-a-lovehate-story-the-kate-mcintyre-clere-interview.html|title=screen-space - Features - KANGAROO A LOVE/HATE STORY: THE KATE MCINTYRE-CLERE&amp;nbsp;INTERVIEW|website=screen-space.squarespace.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film opens in the middle of the action, with home video that was shot and provided by one of the interviewees in the film, showing the violent and brutal shooting of kangaroos on the edge of the individual’s property. Kangaroos are seen as the icon of Australia, and the marsupial is featured in everything from tourism advertisements, sports teams, and [[Qantas]], the national airline of Australia. The crux of the documentary is to shed light on the dark and violent truth that lies within the commercial kangaroo industry, and highlights the [[culling]] of the icon. The film does not shy away from the graphic, and gets up close and personal with the aftermath of kangaroo harvesting, explaining that while there are regulations put in place to ensure that the kangaroos are killed in a humane way (a bullet to the head), it is revealed that a sizeable percentage of culled kangaroos were shot in the neck or the jaw, rather than the head, causing prolonged suffering. Another important point that is made in the film is that the systemic algorithm currently in place to track and monitor kangaroo populations, is complicated and flawed as it does include factors such as drought, illegal shooting, climate change, or slow reproduction rates. ''Kangaroo'' includes voices from all sides of the issue, including those from a political and economic perspective, as well as from a humanitarian and scientific perspective, interviewing members of Australian parliament and environmental experts. 

== Cast ==
Due to the documentary nature of the film, the cast does not feature a list of characters, but rather a list of credible sources who lent their time and expertise to appear in the film. Listed here are some of the featured Australians that were interviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Kangaroo (2017)|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6674514/fullcredits|access-date=2018-08-29}} {{better source|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The film received a mix of critical reviews when it first premiered. Many have been in positive support of the film, with the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' saying that Kate and Mick "sound a wake-up siren" and that the film "isn't always pretty, but it is necessary."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/movies/kangaroo-a-love-hate-story-review.html|title=Review: ‘Kangaroo: A Love-Hate Story’ Exposes a Wildlife Massacre|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' as well had positive comments, praising the documentary, exclaiming that it "has the potential to help bring kangaroo welfare and management into much sharper focus in Australia and internationally," if a solution to the slaughter was to ever be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/kangaroo-a-love-hate-story-review-1202664360/|title=Film Review: ‘Kangaroo — A Love-Hate Story’|last=Kuipers|first=Richard|date=2018-01-18|work=Variety|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, did not receive the film positively, especially farmers and those working in the commercial kangaroo industry, saying that the documentary was a "beat up" and expressed fears that it could ruin the industry. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-07/creator-defends-controversial-kangaroo-cull-documentary/9519180|title=Controversial kangaroo cull documentary defended by creator|date=2018-03-07|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kangaroo'' currently holds a 78% total film score on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Kangaroo|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kangaroo_2018/|language=en|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a score of 66 on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Kangaroo|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/kangaroo?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1c|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Due to the main content of the film, ''Kangaroo'' has caused its fair share of controversy since its release. The topic of the film in itself, the dark reality behind the kangaroo culling industry, was already controversial even before the documentary was made, with Mick and Kate stating that they were shocked at how polarising the documentary was, saying that they "knew it would be polarising, but not this polarising."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/16/kangaroo-film-is-shocking-and-gruesome-but-is-the-analysis-sound|title=Kangaroo film is shocking and gruesome – but is the analysis sound?|last=Buckmaster|first=Luke|date=2018-03-15|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those in government positions, as well as those who make a living in the commercial kangaroo industry, openly criticised the film. When [[NSW Greens]] senator [[Lee Rhiannon]], one of the politicians featured in the documentary, spoke at one of the premieres with several other animal activists, her support and promotion of the film were labeled as "disgusting" by the minister of Federal Agriculture, [[David Littleproud]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A negative reaction was also received from the [[National Farmers' Federation]] (NFF) and its president, Fiona Simson, who slammed  the documentary for "misrepresenting the situation," and "ignoring basic facts," claiming that the film was "very damaging to Australia."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-06/kangaroo-film-beat-up-industry-says/9517506|title=Controversial kangaroo culling film slammed as 'beat-up' by industry and minister|date=2018-03-06|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many other farmers and meat processors have come forward, declaring that Kangaroo uses "shock tactics" and that the film was a complete joke, questioning the motives of the filmmakers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Kay Cottee''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO}} (born 25 January 1954) is an Australian sailor, who was the first woman to perform a [[single-handed sailing|single-handed]], non-stop and unassisted [[circumnavigation]] of the world. She performed this feat in 1988 in her {{convert|37|ft}} yacht  ''Blackmores First Lady'', taking 189 days.

==Personal life==
Born Kay McLaren—the youngest of four daughters—in Sydney on 25 January 1954, Cottee grew up in the southern Sydney suburb of [[Sans Souci, New South Wales|Sans Souci]]. She was born into a yachting family and was taken sailing for the first time when only a few weeks old. For secondary schooling, she attended Moorefield Girls High School in [[Kogarah, New South Wales]].

Cottee now lives in [[Yamba, New South Wales|Yamba]] on the far NSW north coast with television producer husband Peter Sutton. She is an international motivational speaker, skilled boat builder, writer, painter and sculptor.

==Solo circumnavigation==
[[File:"Blackmore's First Lady" (7854122622).jpg|thumb|the yacht ''Blackmores First Lady'']]
On 5 June 1988 at age 34, Kay Cottee became the first woman to sail round the world alone non-stop and unassisted when she sailed through Sydney heads.  She was greeted by tens of thousands of well-wishers. Cottee had left the harbour 189 days earlier, on 29 November 1987.&lt;ref name=Eugene&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia hails woman-sailor for non-stop, solo world trip|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=v-hVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=q-EDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6855,1415290&amp;dq=kay+cottee&amp;hl=en|accessdate=22 February 2013|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|date=6 June 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Southern Ocean]], Cottee's boat was knocked down continuously and she was washed overboard.&lt;ref name=btcycle&gt;{{cite web|title=Fearless Femmes|url=http://www.btcycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/Outer-Edge-280710.pdf|publisher=btcycle.com|accessdate=22 February 2013|page=71|date=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dinkum Aussies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sporting Oz Sailing- Kay Cottee|url=http://www.dinkumaussies.com/ARMY/..%2FSPORTING%20Oz%20Sailing%2FKay%20Cottee.htm|publisher=Dinkum Aussies|accessdate=22 February 2013|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;   When Cottee rounded Cape Horn, the southernmost tip of South America, she celebrated with a lunch of crab, mayonnaise and self baked bread, and a bottle of [[Penfolds Grange|Grange]], a prestigious Australian wine.&lt;ref name="Dinkum Aussies" /&gt;

Cottee and her major sponsor Blackmores Limited used the voyage to raise over $1M for the Rev. [[Ted Noffs]]' Life Education Program. Cottee also undertook an 18-month national schools tour, speaking to over 40,000 senior high school students, imparting the message you can achieve your dreams if you work steadily towards them.

[[File:Landfalling New York hurricanes.png|400px|thumb|Track map of all storms known to have made landfall in the state of New York]]
84&amp;nbsp;tropical or subtropical [[cyclone]]s have affected the state of [[New York State|New York]] since the 17th century. The state of New York is located along the [[East Coast of the United States]], in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] portion of the country. The strongest of these storms was the [[1938 New England hurricane]], which struck [[Long Island]] as a Category&amp;nbsp;3 storm on the [[Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale]]. Killing more than 600&amp;nbsp;people, it was also the deadliest. Tropical cyclones have affected the state primarily in September but have also hit during every month of the hurricane season, June through November. Tropical cyclones rarely make landfall on the state, although it is common for remnants of tropical cyclones to produce heavy rainfall and flooding.

The largest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Basin, wind gusts topped {{convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in some parts of the New York Metropolitan area. Sandy caused a record {{convert|14.41|ft}} storm surge at Battery Park, New York City, flooding various parts of Lower Manhattan including various tunnels and subway systems, making them inoperable for weeks. As of late 2018 some are still damaged. The immediate aftermath included widespread flooding, massive power outages and a system-wide disruption of mass transit service. Sandy had a significant effect on the digital world: 1/4 of cable, Internet, and wireless providers were unable to properly operate following the storm.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Over nine million customers were without power, including 90 percent of Long Island and most of Manhattan below 49th Street, some for several months. Many low-lying neighborhoods in NJ and NY were completely destroyed.  Thousands of homes and businesses were demolished by the record storm surge.
* June 7–8, 2013 - Remnants of [[Tropical Storm Andrea (2013)|Tropical Storm Andrea]] impact New York with 4+ inches of rain and wind gusts of {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.
* July 4, 2014 - [[Hurricane Arthur]] passes to the southeast of New York, producing light to moderate rainfall along the coast; however, winds remain generally below tropical storm force. Some holiday celebrations in the New York metropolitan area were canceled or postponed.

'''Mabel Osgood Wright''' (January 26, 1859 – July 16, 1934) was an American author. She was an early leader in the [[Audubon movement]] who wrote extensively about nature and birds.

==Early years and education==
Mabel Osgood was the daughter of Samuel and Ellen Haswell (Murdock) Osgood. She was born in [[New York City]] on January 26, 1859, and was educated at home and in private schools.{{sfnp|Welker|1971}}

==Career==
On September 25, 1884, she was married to James Osborne Wright, an [[English people|Englishman]]; after an extended visit to England, the couple moved to [[Fairfield, Connecticut]].{{sfnp|Welker|1971}}

Wright's first printed work (apart from a few verses), was the essay "A New England May Day", which appeared in the New York ''Evening Post'' in 1893.{{sfnp|Welker|1971}} This work was collected with other pieces into her first book, ''The Friendship of Nature'', published by Macmillan in 1894.{{sfnp|Welker|1971}} The following year, Wright released ''Birdcraft: A Field Book of Two Hundred Song, Game, and Water Birds''.{{sfnp|Welker|1971}}  A prototype of the modern [[field guide]] to birds for a popular audience, ''Birdcraft'' featured color reproductions from [[John James Audubon]] and other artists to illustrate species commonly encountered at home or in a neighboring park.{{sfnp|Dunlap|2011|pp=15,46}} A later edition credits [[Louis Agassiz Fuertes]] as a contributing artist.  [[Frank M. Chapman]] described it as "one of the first and most successful bird manuals."{{sfnp|Welker|1971}}  Two years later, Wright's ''Citizen Bird: Scenes from Bird-life in Plain English for Beginners,'' a collaboration with [[Elliott Coues]], appeared.

From its inception in 1899, Wright contributed to Chapman's ''[[Bird-Lore]]'', co-editing its Audubon department with [[William Dutcher]].{{sfnp|Dunlap|2011|p=56}}  She served as a contributing editor until her death.{{sfnp|Welker|1971}}  She helped organize the [[Connecticut Audubon Society]], became its first president in 1898, and served for many years.{{sfnp|Welker|1971}} From 1905 to 1928, Wright was a director of the National Association of Audubon Societies (now the [[National Audubon Society]]).{{sfnp|Welker|1971}}  Wright became an associate member of the [[American Ornithologists' Union]] in 1895,{{sfnp|Welker|1971}} and was one of the first three women raised to elective membership in 1901.{{sfnp|Barrow, Jr.|1998|p=266}} Joining her were [[Florence Merriam Bailey]] and [[Olive Thorne Miller]].&lt;ref name=aou-19&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sage|first=John H.|title=Nineteenth Congress of the American Ornithologists' Union|journal=The Auk|date=January 1902|volume=19|issue=1|pages=64–69|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v019n01/p0064-p0069.pdf|accessdate=10 July 2013|doi=10.2307/4069208}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wright pioneered bird protection by establishing [[Birdcraft Sanctuary]] in 1914, near her home in Fairfield.{{sfnp|Welker|1971}}  The refuge is the oldest private songbird sanctuary in the United States.

From her beginnings as a writer about children, nature, and outdoor life, Wright's reception from the public was cordial. However, when she began to publish works of fiction, she concealed her identity as their author until they had won recognition independently, taking the [[pen name|pseudonym]] of "Barbara". Much of the material to which she gave attractive literary expression she found in the large garden at her home in Fairfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor1-last=Gilman|editor1-first=D.C.|editor2-last=Thurston|editor2-first=H.T.|editor3-last=Moore|editor3-first=F.|encyclopedia=New International Encyclop&amp;aelig;dia|edition=2nd|title=Wright, Mabel Osgood|year=1916|publisher=Dodd, Mead|location=New York, NY|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jAcoAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA822&amp;ots=7LQjzEOnip&amp;dq=new%20international%20encyclopedia%20mabel%20osgood%20wright&amp;pg=PA822#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20international%20encyclopedia%20mabel%20osgood%20wright&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Wright is remembered more for her nature writing, some aspects of her fiction are notable.  Some of these romances were unconventional in form, combining passages of fictional narrative with letters, diary entries, and nonfictional pieces of autobiography, social criticism, and gardening lore.  It is true that her fictional range was narrow, limited demographically to the upper classes of Manhattan and New England and emotionally to scenes of domestic piety and sentimentality. But her observations of changing social patterns (the "new magnates" of the new century and increased suburbanization) and of the growth of feminism are worthwhile. Her ambivalence toward the changing role of women is interesting, with sympathy on the one hand and shrill attacks on careerism on the other.{{sfnp|Welker|1971}}

On July 16, 1934, she succumbed to hypertensive myocardial disease with angina, and died in Fairfield. She is buried in Oaklawn Cemetery in that town.{{sfnp|Welker|1971}}

==Biography==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
Djilali was born and raised in Algeria and educated in the UK and Canada. After completing a BSc (Hon.) in Aeronautical Engineering at the [[University of Hertfordshire]] and a MSc in Aeronautics at [[Imperial College]], London he served with the Air Force (compulsory military service) and then worked as an airworthiness engineer and as a lecturer at the Ecole Nationale des Techniques de l'Aviation Civile, Algeria. He moved to Canada in 1982, earned a PhD in experimental and [[computational fluid dynamics]] from the [[University of British Columbia]] in 1987, and joined the Advanced Aerodynamics Department of [[Bombardier Aerospace]], Montreal in 1989, where he worked on the design of the [[Canadair Regional Jet]] and on the development of advanced [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] methods. He was appointed at the [[University of Victoria]] in 1991.  

==Work== 
Prof. Djilali’s earliest work focused on computational and experimental [[fluid mechanics]] and [[heat transfer]], including fundamental aspects of complex [[turbulence]], thermosolutal transport in [[epitaxial crystal growth]] of semiconductors, and [[membrane separation]] processes for [[desalination]] and [[water purification]]. He is particularly known for his contributions to [[fuel cell]] science and technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=Fall 2016|title=Ned Djilali: A Fuel Cell Guru|url=http://csme-scgm.ca/sites/default/files/BULLETIN-FALL-2016.pdf|journal=The Canadian Society for Mechanical Engineering Bulletin|volume=|pages=19-20|via=csme-scgm.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and for his  work on sustainable [[energy modeling]]. His seminal work includes pioneering computational modeling of [[transport phenomena]] in fuel cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Djilali|first=N.|date=2007-04-01|title=Computational modelling of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells: Challenges and opportunities|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0360544206002246|journal=Energy|volume=32|issue=4|pages=269–280|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2006.08.007|issn=0360-5442|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and novel fuel cell architectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008|title=Research Highlights|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=b805061a|journal=Lab on a Chip|language=en|volume=8|issue=5|pages=645|doi=10.1039/b805061a|issn=1473-0197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/4d/91/5f/eb8e61b9b71afe/US8551637.pdf|title=United States Patent No. US 8,551,637 B2|last=|first=|date=2013-10-08|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His energy systems analysis work has focused on [[demand response]] methods to achieve high penetration of [[renewable energy]] in electric power systems, and the [[water-energy nexus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theclimateexaminer.ca/2016/04/21/when-the-glaciers-go-hydroelectric-vulnerability-and-climate-change/|title=When the glaciers go: Hydroelectric vulnerability and climate change|last=|first=|date=2016-04-21|work=The Climate Examiner|access-date=2018-03-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Djilali has served as Director of UVic’s Institute for Integrated Energy Systems and of the Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions, leading and facilitating the development and implementation of low carbon energy systems, and forming collaborative partnerships with automotive and clean energy technology companies and organizations around the world including [[Ballard Power Systems|Ballard]], [[Toyota]], [[AECL]], and CFD Research Corporation. Djilali was a member of the task force that developed the “BC Hydrogen &amp; Fuel Cell Industry Strategy” reporting to the Premier’s Technology Council. He was a High Level Visiting Researcher with the CNRS [[Institut de Mécanique des Fluides de Toulouse]] (France) in 1997-1998,  an ERCOFTAC  visiting Fellow with ETH in 2003, a Visiting Professor with the [[National Research Council (Canada)|NRC]] Institute for Fuel Cell Innovation in 2004, a  Professor in Residence with Angstrom Power Inc. in 2005, and a Visiting Professor with NEXT Energy, [[University of Oldenburg]] in 2016. Djilali was also appointed Guest Professor at [[Chongqing University]] and [[Shanghai University]], and Honorary Professor at [[Tianjin University]].  He was a member of the founding editorial board of the [[ASME]] &lt;em&gt;Journal of Fuel Cell Science &amp; Technology&lt;/em&gt; (now &lt;em&gt;Journal of Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage&lt;/em&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://electrochemical.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/journal.aspx?journalid=123|title=Journal of Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage {{!}} ASME DC|last=|first=|date=|website=electrochemical.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2018}}  and served on the board of several other journals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Prof. Djilali was President of the CFD Society of Canada from 2000-2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfdcanada.ca/about-us/past-presidents/|title=Past Presidents {{!}} CFD Society of Canada|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cfdcanada.ca|language=en-CA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and chaired the CFD97 Conference and ISTP-20 (Int.

{{The Works of Aristotle}}
'''''Parts of Animals''''' (or '''''On the Parts of Animals'''''; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] Περὶ ζῴων μορίων; [[Latin]] ''De Partibus Animalium'') is one of [[Aristotle]]'s major [[Aristotle's biology|texts on biology]]. It was written around 350 BC. The whole work is roughly a study in animal [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]; it aims to provide a scientific understanding of the parts (organs, tissues, fluids, etc.) of animals.

'''Per Fugelli''' (7 December 1943 – 13 September 2017) was a Norwegian physician and professor of [[General Practice]] at the [[University of Bergen]] from 1984 to 1992, and [[social medicine]] at the [[University of Oslo]] from 1992 until his death in 2017.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Per Fugelli |first= |last= |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor-last=Godal | editor-first=Anne Marit | editor-link=Anne Marit Godal |publisher=Norsk nettleksikon |location=Oslo |url=http://snl.no/Per_Fugelli|language=Norwegian|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Fugelli was born in [[Stavanger]], Norway, on December 7, 1943. He studied medicine at [[University of Oslo]].&lt;ref name=lancet&gt;Barbara Casassus. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32737-X Obituary Per Fugelli.] The Lancet, Volume 390, No. 10107, p2032, 4 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
From 1971–73 Fugelli was a general practitioner in [[Værøy]] and [[Røst]], and from 1977 to 1980 in [[Porsanger]]. During this time he earned his PhD and graduated in 1978. In 1984, he became a Professor of [[General Practice]] at the [[University of Bergen]], where he stayed until 1992. He became a Professor of [[social medicine]] at University of Oslo´s Institute of Health and Society. In 2013, he became Emeritus.&lt;ref name=lancet/&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1993 Fugelli wrote: "The patient Earth is sick. Global environmental disruptions can have serious consequences for human health. It's time for doctors to give a world diagnosis and advise on treatment," &lt;ref name=lancet/&gt; predating the founding of [[planetary health]]. He is the subject of the documentary ''I die'' by filmmaker [[Erik Poppe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nfi.no/eng/film?name=per-fugelli--i-die&amp;id=1859|title=Per Fugelli - I die|last=|first=|date=|work=Norwegian Film Institute|access-date=2018-08-29|language=nb-NO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
He was a frequent contributor to the public debate on health and medical questions. Among his early books are ''Tilbake til huslegen'' from 1975, ''Doktor på Værøy og Røst'' from 1977, and ''Helsetilstand og helsetjeneste på Værøy og Røst'' from 1978.

He published the essay collections ''Med sordin og kanon'' and ''Helse og rettferdighet'' in 1990, ''0-visjonen'' in 2003, and ''Nokpunktet'' in 2008. He has been editor or co-editor of several works, including ''Huslegen'' from 1985, ''Medisinsk leksikon'' from 1990, ''Medisin og helse'' from 1993, and ''Verdier og penger i helsetjenesten'' from 2009.&lt;ref name=uio-booklist&gt;{{cite web|title=Liste over Per Fugellis bøker |url=http://folk.uio.no/pfugelli/ref_boker.htm |publisher=University of Oslo |language=Norwegian|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fugelli | first1 = P | year = 2006 | title = The Zero-vision: potential side effects of communicating health perfection and zero risk | url = | journal = Patient Educ Couns | volume = 60 | issue = 3| pages = 267–271 | doi = 10.1016/j.pec.2005.11.002 | pmid = 16469471 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Fugelli was married, had two children, and three grandchildren by the time he died.&lt;ref name=lancet/&gt;

In 2009, he was diagnosed with colorectal cancer. It metastasized into his lungs and by 2012, the cancer was declared terminal. Nevertheless, Fugelli continued to write and work as long as he was able, with his final published article written six weeks before his death. He died at [[Jæren]] on 13 September 2017, aged 73.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/per-fugelli/per-fugelli-er-doed/a/24115227/ |title= Per Fugelli er død |date =13 September 2017 |first1=Mona |last1=Langset |first2=Maiken |last2=Svendsen |newspaper =VG |accessdate=13 September 2017|language =no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earth-cutaway-schematic-english.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Diagram of the internal layering of the Earth showing the lithosphere above the asthenosphere (not to scale)]]
'''Plate tectonics''' (from the [[Late Latin]] ''tectonicus'', from the {{lang-el|τεκτονικός}} "pertaining to building"){{sfn|Little|Fowler|Coulson|1990}} is a [[scientific theory]] describing the large-scale motion of seven large plates and the movements of a larger number of smaller plates of the [[Earth]]'s [[lithosphere]], since tectonic processes began on Earth between 3 and 3.5 billion years ago. The model builds on the concept of [[continental drift]], an idea developed during the first decades of the 20th century. The [[Earth science|geoscientific]] community accepted plate-tectonic theory after [[seafloor spreading]] was validated in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

The lithosphere, which is the rigid outermost shell of a planet (the crust and upper mantle), is broken into [[list of tectonic plates|tectonic plates]]. The Earth's lithosphere is composed of seven or eight major plates (depending on how they are defined) and many minor plates. Where the plates meet, their relative motion determines the type of boundary: [[convergent boundary|convergent]], [[divergent boundary|divergent]], or [[transform fault|transform]]. [[Earthquake]]s, [[volcano|volcanic activity]], [[mountain]]-building, and [[oceanic trench]] formation occur along these plate boundaries (or [[fault (geology)|faults]]). The relative movement of the plates typically ranges from zero to 100&amp;nbsp;mm annually.{{sfn|Read|Watson|1975}}

Tectonic plates are composed of oceanic lithosphere and thicker continental lithosphere, each topped by its own kind of [[crust (geology)|crust]]. Along convergent boundaries, [[subduction]], or one plate moving under another, carries the lower one down into the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]]; the material lost is roughly balanced by the formation of new (oceanic) crust along divergent margins by seafloor spreading. In this way, the total surface of the lithosphere remains the same. This prediction of plate tectonics is also referred to as the conveyor belt principle. Earlier theories, since disproven, proposed gradual shrinking (contraction) or gradual [[expanding Earth|expansion of the globe]].{{sfn|Scalera|Lavecchia|2006}}

Tectonic plates are able to move because the Earth's lithosphere has greater [[mechanical properties|mechanical strength]] than the underlying [[asthenosphere]]. Lateral density variations in the mantle result in [[mantle convection|convection]]; that is, the slow creeping motion of Earth's solid mantle. Plate movement is thought to be driven by a combination of the motion of the seafloor away from [[spreading ridge]]s due to variations in [[topography]] (the ridge is a topographic high) and [[density]] changes in the crust (density increases as newly formed crust cools and moves away from the ridge). At subduction zones the relatively cold, dense crust is "pulled" or sinks down into the mantle over the downward convecting limb of a [[mantle cell]]. Another explanation lies in the different forces generated by tidal forces of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]]. The relative importance of each of these factors and their relationship to each other is unclear, and still the subject of much debate.

==Key principles==
The [[structure of the Earth|outer layers of the Earth]] are divided into the [[lithosphere]] and [[asthenosphere]]. The division is based on differences in [[mechanical properties]] and in the method for [[heat transfer|the transfer of heat]]. The lithosphere is cooler and more rigid, while the asthenosphere is hotter and flows more easily. In terms of heat transfer, the lithosphere loses heat by [[heat conduction|conduction]], whereas the asthenosphere also transfers heat by [[convection]] and has a nearly [[adiabatic]] temperature gradient. This division should not be confused with the ''chemical'' subdivision of these same layers into the mantle (comprising both the asthenosphere and the mantle portion of the lithosphere) and the crust: a given piece of mantle may be part of the lithosphere or the asthenosphere at different times depending on its temperature and pressure.

The key principle of plate tectonics is that the lithosphere exists as separate and distinct ''[[list of tectonic plates|tectonic plates]]'', which ride on the fluid-like ([[visco-elastic]] solid) asthenosphere. Plate motions range up to a typical 10–40&amp;nbsp;mm/year ([[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]]; about as fast as [[fingernail]]s grow), to about 160&amp;nbsp;mm/year ([[Nazca Plate]]; about as fast as [[hair]] grows).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zhen Shao|1997}}, {{harvnb|Hancock|Skinner|Dineley|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The driving mechanism behind this movement is described below.

Tectonic lithosphere plates consist of lithospheric mantle overlain by one or two types of crustal material: [[oceanic crust]] (in older texts called ''[[sima (geology)|sima]]'' from [[silicon]] and [[magnesium]]) and [[continental crust]] (''[[sial]]'' from silicon and [[aluminium]]). Average oceanic lithosphere is typically {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} thick;{{sfn|Turcotte|Schubert|2002|p=5}} its thickness is a function of its age: as time passes, it conductively cools and subjacent cooling mantle is added to its base. Because it is formed at mid-ocean ridges and spreads outwards, its thickness is therefore a function of its distance from the mid-ocean ridge where it was formed. For a typical distance that oceanic lithosphere must travel before being subducted, the thickness varies from about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} thick at mid-ocean ridges to greater than {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} at [[subduction]] zones; for shorter or longer distances, the subduction zone (and therefore also the mean) thickness becomes smaller or larger, respectively.{{sfn|Turcotte|Schubert|2002}} Continental lithosphere is typically about 200&amp;nbsp;km thick, though this varies considerably between basins, mountain ranges, and stable [[craton]]ic interiors of continents.

The location where two plates meet is called a ''plate boundary''. Plate boundaries are commonly associated with geological events such as [[earthquake]]s and the creation of topographic features such as [[mountain]]s, [[volcano]]es, [[mid-ocean ridge]]s, and [[oceanic trench]]es. The majority of the world's active volcanoes occur along plate boundaries, with the Pacific Plate's [[Pacific Ring of Fire|Ring of Fire]] being the most active and widely known today. These boundaries are discussed in further detail below. Some volcanoes occur in the interiors of plates, and these have been variously attributed to internal plate deformation{{sfn|Foulger|2010}} and to mantle plumes.

As explained above, tectonic plates may include continental crust or oceanic crust, and most plates contain both. For example, the [[African Plate]] includes the continent and parts of the floor of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] Oceans. The distinction between oceanic crust and continental crust is based on their modes of formation. Oceanic crust is formed at sea-floor spreading centers, and continental crust is formed through [[volcanic arc|arc volcanism]] and [[accretion (geology)|accretion]] of [[terrane]]s through tectonic processes, though some of these terranes may contain [[ophiolite]] sequences, which are pieces of oceanic crust considered to be part of the continent when they exit the standard cycle of formation and spreading centers and subduction beneath continents. Oceanic crust is also denser than continental crust owing to their different compositions. Oceanic crust is denser because it has less silicon and more heavier elements ("[[mafic]]") than continental crust ("[[felsic]]").{{sfn|Schmidt|Harbert|1998}} As a result of this density stratification, oceanic crust generally lies below [[sea level]] (for example most of the [[Pacific Plate]]), while continental crust buoyantly projects above sea level (see the page [[isostasy]] for explanation of this principle).

==Types of plate boundaries==
{{Main|List of tectonic plate interactions}}

Three types of plate boundaries exist,{{sfn|Meissner|2002|p=100}} with a fourth, mixed type, characterized by the way the plates move relative to each other. They are associated with different types of surface phenomena. The different types of plate boundaries are:&lt;ref name='platetectonics.com'&gt;{{cite web |title=Plate Tectonics: Plate Boundaries |url=http://www.platetectonics.com/book/page_5.asp |publisher=platetectonics.com |accessdate=12 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616062513/http://www.platetectonics.com/book/page_5.asp |archivedate=16 June 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= 'usgs.understanding.com'&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding plate motions |url= http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/understanding.html|publisher=USGS|accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Continental-continental conservative plate boundary opposite directions.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Transform boundary]]
[[File:Continental-continental constructive plate boundary.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Divergent boundary]]
[[File:Continental-continental destructive plate boundary.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Convergent boundary]]
# ''[[transform faults|Transform boundaries]] (Conservative)'' occur where two lithospheric plates slide, or perhaps more accurately, grind past each other along [[transform fault]]s, where plates are neither created nor destroyed. The relative motion of the two plates is either [[sinistral]] (left side toward the observer) or [[dextral]] (right side toward the observer). Transform faults occur across a spreading center. Strong earthquakes can occur along a fault. The [[San Andreas Fault]] in California is an example of a transform boundary exhibiting dextral motion.
# ''[[Divergent boundary|Divergent boundaries]] (Constructive)'' occur where two plates slide apart from each other. At zones of ocean-to-ocean rifting, divergent boundaries form by seafloor spreading, allowing for the formation of new [[oceanic basin|ocean basin]]. As the ocean plate splits, the ridge forms at the spreading center, the ocean basin expands, and finally, the plate area increases causing many small volcanoes and/or shallow earthquakes. At zones of continent-to-continent rifting, divergent boundaries may cause new ocean basin to form as the continent splits, spreads, the central rift collapses, and ocean fills the basin. Active zones of mid-ocean ridges (e.g., the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] and [[East Pacific Rise]]), and continent-to-continent rifting (such as Africa's [[East African Rift]] and Valley and the Red Sea), are examples of divergent boundaries.
# ''[[Convergent boundary|Convergent boundaries]] (Destructive)'' (or ''active margins'') occur where two plates slide toward each other to form either a [[subduction]] zone (one plate moving underneath the other) or a [[continental collision]]. At zones of ocean-to-continent subduction (e.g. the [[Andes]] mountain range in South America, and the Cascade Mountains in Western United States), the dense oceanic lithosphere plunges beneath the less dense continent. Earthquakes trace the path of the downward-moving plate as it descends into asthenosphere, a trench forms, and as the subducted plate is heated it releases volatiles, mostly water from [[serpentinite|hydrous minerals]], into the surrounding mantle. The addition of water lowers the melting point of the mantle material above the subducting slab, causing it to melt. The magma that results typically leads to volcanism.&lt;ref name=H2O&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grove|first1=Timothy L.|last2=Till|first2=Christy B.|last3=Krawczynski|first3=Michael J.|title=The Role of H2O in Subduction Zone Magmatism|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|volume=40|date=8 March 2012|issue=40|pages=413–39|doi=10.1146/annurev-earth-042711-105310|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235935490|accessdate=14 January 2016|bibcode= 2012AREPS..40..413G}}&lt;/ref&gt; At zones of ocean-to-ocean subduction (e.g. [[Aleutian islands]], [[Mariana Islands]], and the [[Japan]]ese [[island arc]]), older, cooler, denser crust slips beneath less dense crust. This motion causes earthquakes and a deep trench to form in an arc shape. The upper mantle of the subducted plate then heats and magma rises to form curving chains of volcanic islands. Deep marine trenches are typically associated with subduction zones, and the basins that develop along the active boundary are often called "foreland basins". Closure of ocean basins can occur at continent-to-continent boundaries (e.g., Himalayas and Alps): collision between masses of granitic continental lithosphere; neither mass is subducted; plate edges are compressed, folded, uplifted.
# ''Plate boundary zones'' occur where the effects of the interactions are unclear, and the boundaries, usually occurring along a broad belt, are not well defined and may show various types of movements in different episodes.

==Driving forces of plate motion==
[[File:Global plate motion 2008-04-17.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Plate motion based on Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite data from NASA [http://sideshow.jpl.nasa.gov/mbh/series.html JPL]. The vectors show direction and magnitude of motion.]]

It has generally been accepted that tectonic plates are able to move because of the relative density of oceanic lithosphere and the relative weakness of the asthenosphere. [[Earth's internal heat budget|Dissipation of heat from the mantle]] is acknowledged to be the original source of the energy required to drive plate tectonics through convection or large scale upwelling and doming. The current view, though still a matter of some debate, asserts that as a consequence, a powerful source of plate motion is generated due to the excess density of the oceanic lithosphere sinking in subduction zones. When the new crust forms at mid-ocean ridges, this oceanic lithosphere is initially less dense than the underlying asthenosphere, but it becomes denser with age as it conductively cools and thickens. The greater [[density]] of old lithosphere relative to the underlying asthenosphere allows it to sink into the deep mantle at subduction zones, providing most of the driving force for plate movement. The weakness of the asthenosphere allows the tectonic plates to move easily towards a subduction zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Pedro |last=Mendia-Landa |url=http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/2007/4/07.04.13.x.html |title=Myths and Legends on Natural Disasters: Making Sense of Our World |accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although subduction is thought to be the strongest force driving plate motions, it cannot be the only force since there are plates such as the North American Plate which are moving, yet are nowhere being subducted. The same is true for the enormous [[Eurasian Plate]]. The sources of plate motion are a matter of intensive research and discussion among scientists. One of the main points is that the [[kinematic|kinematic pattern]] of the movement itself should be separated clearly from the possible geodynamic mechanism that is invoked as the driving force of the observed movement, as some patterns may be explained by more than one mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Dijk|1992}}, {{harvnb|van Dijk|Okkes|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the driving forces advocated at the moment can be divided into three categories based on the relationship to the movement: mantle dynamics related, gravity related (mostly secondary forces), and earth rotation related.

===Driving forces related to mantle dynamics===
{{Main|Mantle convection}}
For much of the last quarter century, the leading theory of the driving force behind tectonic plate motions envisaged large scale convection currents in the upper mantle, which can be transmitted through the asthenosphere. This theory was launched by [[Arthur Holmes]] and some forerunners in the 1930s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Radioactivity and Earth Movements|first=Arthur|last=Holmes|authorlink= Arthur Holmes|journal=Transactions of the Geological Society of Glasgow|year=1931|pages=559–606|url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebDocuments/Holmes1931.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was immediately recognized as the solution for the acceptance of the theory as originally discussed in the papers of [[Alfred Wegener]] in the early years of the century. However, despite its acceptance, it was long debated in the scientific community because the leading theory still envisaged a static Earth without moving continents up until the major breakthroughs of the early sixties.

Two- and three-dimensional imaging of Earth's interior ([[seismic tomography]]) shows a varying lateral density distribution throughout the mantle. Such density variations can be material (from rock chemistry), mineral (from variations in mineral structures), or thermal (through thermal expansion and contraction from heat energy). The manifestation of this varying lateral density is [[mantle convection]] from buoyancy forces.{{sfn|Tanimoto|Lay|2000}}

How mantle convection directly and indirectly relates to plate motion is a matter of ongoing study and discussion in geodynamics. Somehow, this [[energy]] must be transferred to the lithosphere for tectonic plates to move. There are essentially two main types of forces that are thought to influence plate motion: [[friction]] and [[gravity]].
*Basal drag (friction): Plate motion driven by friction between the convection currents in the asthenosphere and the more rigid overlying lithosphere.
*Slab suction (gravity): Plate motion driven by local convection currents that exert a downward pull on plates in subduction zones at ocean trenches. [[Slab pull|Slab suction]] may occur in a geodynamic setting where basal tractions continue to act on the plate as it dives into the mantle (although perhaps to a greater extent acting on both the under and upper side of the slab).

Lately, the convection theory has been much debated, as modern techniques based on 3D seismic tomography still fail to recognize these predicted large scale convection cells.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Alternative views have been proposed.

====Plume tectonics====
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2018}}
In the theory of [[plume tectonics]] developed during the 1990s, a modified concept of mantle convection currents is used. It asserts that super plumes rise from the deeper mantle and are the drivers or substitutes of the major convection cells. These ideas, which find their roots in the early 1930s, find resonance in the modern theories which envisage [[hotspot (geology)|hot spots]] or [[mantle plumes]] which remain fixed and are overridden by oceanic and continental lithosphere plates over time and leave their traces in the geological record (though these phenomena are not invoked as real driving mechanisms, but rather as modulators).

====Surge tectonics====
Another theory is that the mantle flows neither in cells nor large plumes but rather as a series of channels just below the Earth's crust, which then provide basal friction to the lithosphere. This theory, called "surge tectonics", became quite popular in geophysics and geodynamics during the 1980s and 1990s.{{sfn|Meyerhoff|Taner|Morris|Agocs|1996}} Recent research, based on three-dimensional computer modeling, suggests that plate geometry is governed by a feedback between mantle convection patterns and the strength of the lithosphere.&lt;ref name="MallardColtice2016"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Claire |last1=Mallard |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01355818/document |title=Subduction controls the distribution and fragmentation of Earth's tectonic plates |last2=Coltice |first2=Nicolas |last3=Seton |first3=Maria |last4=Müller |first4=R.

===Driving forces related to gravity===
Forces related to gravity are usually invoked as secondary phenomena within the framework of a more general driving mechanism such as the various forms of mantle dynamics described above.

Gravitational sliding away from a spreading ridge: According to many authors, plate motion is driven by the higher elevation of plates at ocean ridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spence|1987}}, {{harvnb|White|McKenzie|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As oceanic lithosphere is formed at spreading ridges from hot mantle material, it gradually cools and thickens with age (and thus adds distance from the ridge). Cool oceanic lithosphere is significantly denser than the hot mantle material from which it is derived and so with increasing thickness it gradually subsides into the mantle to compensate the greater load. The result is a slight lateral incline with increased distance from the ridge axis.

This force is regarded as a secondary force and is often referred to as "[[ridge push force|ridge push]]". This is a misnomer as nothing is "pushing" horizontally and tensional features are dominant along ridges. It is more accurate to refer to this mechanism as gravitational sliding as variable topography across the totality of the plate can vary considerably and the topography of spreading ridges is only the most prominent feature. Other mechanisms generating this gravitational secondary force include flexural bulging of the lithosphere before it dives underneath an adjacent plate which produces a clear topographical feature that can offset, or at least affect, the influence of topographical ocean ridges, and [[mantle plume]]s and hot spots, which are postulated to impinge on the underside of tectonic plates.

Slab-pull: Current scientific opinion is that the asthenosphere is insufficiently competent or rigid to directly cause motion by friction along the base of the lithosphere. [[Slab pull]] is therefore most widely thought to be the greatest force acting on the plates. In this current understanding, plate motion is mostly driven by the weight of cold, dense plates sinking into the mantle at trenches.{{sfn|Conrad|Lithgow-Bertelloni|2002}} Recent models indicate that [[back-arc basin|trench suction]] plays an important role as well. However, the fact that the [[North American Plate]] is nowhere being subducted, although it is in motion, presents a problem. The same holds for the African, [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]], and [[Antarctic Plate|Antarctic]] plates.

Gravitational sliding away from mantle doming: According to older theories, one of the driving mechanisms of the plates is the existence of large scale asthenosphere/mantle domes which cause the gravitational sliding of lithosphere plates away from them. This gravitational sliding represents a secondary phenomenon of this basically vertically oriented mechanism. This can act on various scales, from the small scale of one island arc up to the larger scale of an entire ocean basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spence|1987}}, {{Harvnb|White|Mckenzie|1989}}, {{Harvnb|Segev|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Driving forces related to Earth rotation===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
[[Alfred Wegener]], being a [[meteorology|meteorologist]], had proposed [[tidal force]]s and [[centrifugal force]]s as the main driving mechanisms behind [[continental drift]]; however, these forces were considered far too small to cause continental motion as the concept was of continents plowing through oceanic crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/wegener.html |title=Alfred Wegener (1880–1930) |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Wegener later changed his position and asserted that convection currents are the main driving force of plate tectonics in the last edition of his book in 1929.

However, in the plate tectonics context (accepted since the [[seafloor spreading]] proposals of Heezen, Hess, Dietz, Morley, Vine, and Matthews (see below) during the early 1960s), the oceanic crust is suggested to be in motion ''with'' the continents which caused the proposals related to Earth rotation to be reconsidered. In more recent literature, these driving forces are:
# Tidal drag due to the gravitational force the [[Moon]] (and the [[Sun]]) exerts on the crust of the [[Earth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.caltech.edu/press_releases/13411 |title=Caltech Researchers Use GPS Data to Model Effects of Tidal Loads on Earth's Surface |publisher=Caltech |date=April 15, 2011 |accessdate=August 15, 2012 |author=Neith, Katie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019023322/http://media.caltech.edu/press_releases/13411 |archivedate=October 19, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Global deformation of the [[geoid]] due to small displacements of the rotational pole with respect to the Earth's crust;

# The [[centrifugal force]], which is treated as a slight modification of gravity&lt;ref name=Ricard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Glatzmaier2013/&gt;{{rp|249}}

For these mechanisms to be overall valid, systematic relationships should exist all over the globe between the orientation and kinematics of deformation and the geographical [[latitude|latitudinal]] and [[longitude|longitudinal]] grid of the Earth itself. Ironically, these systematic relations studies in the second half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century underline exactly the opposite: that the plates had not moved in time, that the deformation grid was fixed with respect to the Earth [[equator]] and axis, and that gravitational driving forces were generally acting vertically and caused only local horizontal movements (the so-called pre-plate tectonic, "fixist theories"). Later studies (discussed below on this page), therefore, invoked many of the relationships recognized during this pre-plate tectonics period to support their theories (see the anticipations and reviews in the work of van Dijk and collaborators).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Dijk|1992}}, {{harvnb|van Dijk|Okkes|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the many forces discussed in this paragraph, tidal force is still highly debated and defended as a possible principal driving force of plate tectonics. The other forces are only used in global geodynamic models not using plate tectonics concepts (therefore beyond the discussions treated in this section) or proposed as minor modulations within the overall plate tectonics model.

In 1973, George W. Moore{{sfn|Moore|1973}} of the [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] and R. C. Bostrom{{sfn|Bostrom|1971}} presented evidence for a general westward drift of the Earth's lithosphere with respect to the mantle. He concluded that tidal forces (the tidal lag or "friction") caused by the Earth's rotation and the forces acting upon it by the Moon are a driving force for plate tectonics. As the Earth spins eastward beneath the moon, the moon's gravity ever so slightly pulls the Earth's surface layer back westward, just as proposed by Alfred Wegener (see above). In a more recent 2006 study,{{sfn|Scoppola|Boccaletti|Bevis|Carminati|2006}} scientists reviewed and advocated these earlier proposed ideas. It has also been suggested recently in {{Harvtxt|Lovett|2006}} that this observation may also explain why [[Venus]] and [[Mars]] have no plate tectonics, as Venus has no moon and Mars' moons are too small to have significant tidal effects on the planet. In a recent paper,{{sfn|Torsvik|Steinberger|Gurnie s|Gaina|2010}} it was suggested that, on the other hand, it can easily be observed that many plates are moving north and eastward, and that the dominantly westward motion of the Pacific Ocean basins derives simply from the eastward bias of the Pacific spreading center (which is not a predicted manifestation of such lunar forces). In the same paper the authors admit, however, that relative to the lower mantle, there is a slight westward component in the motions of all the plates. They demonstrated though that the westward drift, seen only for the past 30&amp;nbsp;Ma, is attributed to the increased dominance of the steadily growing and accelerating Pacific plate. The debate is still open.

===Relative significance of each driving force mechanism===
The [[Euclidean vector|vector]] of a plate's motion is a function of all the forces acting on the plate; however, therein lies the problem regarding the degree to which each process contributes to the overall motion of each tectonic plate.

The diversity of geodynamic settings and the properties of each plate result from the impact of the various processes actively driving each individual plate. One method of dealing with this problem is to consider the relative rate at which each plate is moving as well as the evidence related to the significance of each process to the overall driving force on the plate.

One of the most significant correlations discovered to date is that lithospheric plates attached to downgoing (subducting) plates move much faster than plates not attached to subducting plates. The Pacific plate, for instance, is essentially surrounded by zones of subduction (the so-called Ring of Fire) and moves much faster than the plates of the Atlantic basin, which are attached (perhaps one could say 'welded') to adjacent continents instead of subducting plates. It is thus thought that forces associated with the downgoing plate (slab pull and slab suction) are the driving forces which determine the motion of plates, except for those plates which are not being subducted.{{sfn|Conrad|Lithgow-Bertelloni|2002}} This view however has been contradicted by a recent study which found that the actual motions of the Pacific Plate and other plates associated with the East Pacific Rise do not correlate mainly with either slab pull or slab push, but rather with a mantle convection upwelling whose horizontal spreading along the bases of the various plates drives them along via viscosity-related traction forces.&lt;ref&gt;["Kinematics and dynamics of the East Pacific Rise linked to a stable, deep-mantle upwelling", Rowley et al, Science Advances 23 Dec 2016:Vol. 2, no. 12, e1601107, {{doi|10.1126/sciadv.1601107}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The driving forces of plate motion continue to be active subjects of on-going research within [[geophysics]] and [[tectonophysics]].

===Summary===
[[File:Tectonic_plates_boundaries_physical_World_map_Wt_180degE_centered-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|right|Detailed map showing the tectonic plates with their movement vectors.]]
In line with other previous and contemporaneous proposals, in 1912 the meteorologist [[Alfred Wegener]] amply described what he called continental drift, expanded in his 1915 book ''The Origin of Continents and Oceans''{{sfn|Wegener|1929}} and the scientific debate started that would end up fifty years later in the theory of plate tectonics.{{sfn|Hughes|2001a}} Starting from the idea (also expressed by his forerunners) that the present continents once formed a single land mass (which was called [[Pangea]] later on) that drifted apart, thus releasing the continents from the Earth's mantle and likening them to "icebergs" of low density [[granite]] floating on a sea of denser [[basalt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wegener|1966}}, {{Harvnb|Hughes|2001b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting evidence for the idea came from the dove-tailing outlines of South America's east coast and Africa's west coast, and from the matching of the rock formations along these edges. Confirmation of their previous contiguous nature also came from the fossil plants ''[[Glossopteris]]'' and ''[[Gangamopteris]]'', and the [[therapsid]] or [[mammal-like reptile]] ''[[Lystrosaurus]]'', all widely distributed over South America, Africa, Antarctica, India, and Australia. The evidence for such an erstwhile joining of these continents was patent to field geologists working in the southern hemisphere. The South African [[Alex du Toit]] put together a mass of such information in his 1937 publication ''Our Wandering Continents'', and went further than Wegener in recognising the strong links between the [[Gondwana]] fragments.

But without detailed evidence and a force sufficient to drive the movement, the theory was not generally accepted: the Earth might have a solid crust and mantle and a liquid core, but there seemed to be no way that portions of the crust could move around. Distinguished scientists, such as [[Harold Jeffreys]] and [[Charles Schuchert]], were outspoken critics of continental drift.

Despite much opposition, the view of continental drift gained support and a lively debate started between "drifters" or "mobilists" (proponents of the theory) and "fixists" (opponents). During the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, the former reached important milestones proposing that [[convection current]]s might have driven the plate movements, and that spreading may have occurred below the sea within the oceanic crust. Concepts close to the elements now incorporated in plate tectonics were proposed by geophysicists and geologists (both fixists and mobilists) like Vening-Meinesz, Holmes, and Umbgrove.

One of the first pieces of geophysical evidence that was used to support the movement of lithospheric plates came from [[paleomagnetism]]. This is based on the fact that rocks of different ages show a variable [[magnetic field]] direction, evidenced by studies since the mid–nineteenth century. The magnetic north and south poles reverse through time, and, especially important in paleotectonic studies, the relative position of the magnetic north pole varies through time. Initially, during the first half of the twentieth century, the latter phenomenon was explained by introducing what was called "polar wander" (see [[apparent polar wander]]), i.e., it was assumed that the north pole location had been shifting through time. An alternative explanation, though, was that the continents had moved (shifted and rotated) relative to the north pole, and each continent, in fact, shows its own "polar wander path". During the late 1950s it was successfully shown on two occasions that these data could show the validity of continental drift: by Keith Runcorn in a paper in 1956,{{sfn|Runcorn|1956}} and by Warren Carey in a symposium held in March 1956.{{sfn|Carey|1956}}

The second piece of evidence in support of continental drift came during the late 1950s and early 60s from data on the bathymetry of the deep [[ocean floor]]s and the nature of the oceanic crust such as magnetic properties and, more generally, with the development of [[marine geology]]&lt;ref&gt;see for example the milestone paper of {{Harvnb|Lyman|Fleming|1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which gave evidence for the association of seafloor spreading along the [[mid-oceanic ridge]]s and [[Geomagnetic reversal|magnetic field reversals]], published between 1959 and 1963 by Heezen, Dietz, Hess, Mason, Vine &amp; Matthews, and Morley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Korgen|1995}}, {{Harvnb|Spiess|Kuperman|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneous advances in early [[seismic]] imaging techniques in and around [[Wadati–Benioff zone]]s along the trenches bounding many continental margins, together with many other geophysical (e.g. gravimetric) and geological observations, showed how the oceanic crust could disappear into the mantle, providing the mechanism to balance the extension of the ocean basins with shortening along its margins.

All this evidence, both from the ocean floor and from the continental margins, made it clear around 1965 that continental drift was feasible and the theory of plate tectonics, which was defined in a series of papers between 1965 and 1967, was born, with all its extraordinary explanatory and predictive power. The theory revolutionized the Earth sciences, explaining a diverse range of geological phenomena and their implications in other studies such as [[paleogeography]] and [[paleobiology]].

===Continental drift===
{{Details|Continental drift}}
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, geologists assumed that the Earth's major features were fixed, and that most geologic features such as basin development and mountain ranges could be explained by vertical crustal movement, described in what is called the [[geosyncline|geosynclinal theory]]. Generally, this was placed in the context of a contracting planet Earth due to heat loss in the course of a relatively short geological time.
[[File:Wegener Expedition-1930 008.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Alfred Wegener in Greenland in the winter of 1912–13.]]
It was observed as early as 1596 that the opposite [[coasts]] of the Atlantic Ocean—or, more precisely, the edges of the [[continental shelves]]—have similar shapes and seem to have once fitted together.{{sfn|Kious|Tilling|1996}}

Since that time many theories were proposed to explain this apparent complementarity, but the assumption of a solid Earth made these various proposals difficult to accept.{{sfn|Frankel|1987}}

The discovery of [[radioactivity]] and its associated [[exothermic|heating]] properties in 1895 prompted a re-examination of the apparent [[age of the Earth]].{{sfn|Joly|1909}} This had previously been estimated by its cooling rate under the assumption that the Earth's surface radiated like a [[black body]].{{sfn|Thomson|1863}} Those calculations had implied that, even if it started at [[thermal radiation|red heat]], the Earth would have dropped to its present temperature in a few tens of millions of years. Armed with the knowledge of a new heat source, scientists realized that the Earth would be much older, and that its core was still sufficiently hot to be liquid.

By 1915, after having published a first article in 1912,{{sfn|Wegener|1912}} Alfred Wegener was making serious arguments for the idea of continental drift in the first edition of ''The Origin of Continents and Oceans''.{{sfn|Wegener|1929}} In that book (re-issued in four successive editions up to the final one in 1936), he noted how the east coast of [[South America]] and the west coast of [[Africa]] looked as if they were once attached. Wegener was not the first to note this ([[Abraham Ortelius]], [[Antonio Snider-Pellegrini]], [[Eduard Suess]], [[Roberto Mantovani]] and [[Frank Bursley Taylor]] preceded him just to mention a few), but he was the first to marshal significant [[fossil]] and paleo-topographical and climatological evidence to support this simple observation (and was supported in this by researchers such as [[Alex du Toit]]). Furthermore, when the rock [[stratum|strata]] of the margins of separate continents are very similar it suggests that these rocks were formed in the same way, implying that they were joined initially. For instance, parts of [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]] contain rocks very similar to those found in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and [[New Brunswick]]. Furthermore, the [[Caledonian Mountains]] of Europe and parts of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of North America are very similar in [[Structural geology|structure]] and [[lithology]].

However, his ideas were not taken seriously by many geologists, who pointed out that there was no apparent mechanism for continental drift. Specifically, they did not see how continental rock could plow through the much denser rock that makes up oceanic crust. Wegener could not explain the force that drove continental drift, and his vindication did not come until after his death in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pioneers of Plate Tectonics|url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Plate-Tectonics/Chap1-Pioneers-of-Plate-Tectonics/Alfred-Wegener|website=The Geological Society|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floating continents, paleomagnetism, and seismicity zones===
[[File:Quake epicenters 1963-98.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Global earthquake [[epicenter]]s, 1963–1998. Most earthquakes occur in narrow belts that correspond to the locations of lithospheric plate boundaries.]]
[[File:Map of earthquakes in 2016.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|right|Map of earthquakes in 2016]]

As it was observed early that although [[granite]] existed on continents, seafloor seemed to be composed of denser [[basalt]], the prevailing concept during the first half of the twentieth century was that there were two types of crust, named "sial" (continental type crust) and "sima" (oceanic type crust). Furthermore, it was supposed that a static shell of strata was present under the continents. It therefore looked apparent that a layer of basalt (sial) underlies the continental rocks.

However, based on abnormalities in [[plumb line deflection]] by the [[Andes]] in Peru, [[Pierre Bouguer]] had deduced that less-dense mountains must have a downward projection into the denser layer underneath. The concept that mountains had "roots" was confirmed by [[George B. Airy]] a hundred years later, during study of [[Himalaya]]n gravitation, and seismic studies detected corresponding density variations. Therefore, by the mid-1950s, the question remained unresolved as to whether mountain roots were clenched in surrounding basalt or were floating on it like an iceberg.

During the 20th century, improvements in and greater use of seismic instruments such as [[seismograph]]s enabled scientists to learn that earthquakes tend to be concentrated in specific areas, most notably along the [[oceanic trenches]] and spreading ridges. By the late 1920s, seismologists were beginning to identify several prominent earthquake zones parallel to the trenches that typically were inclined 40–60° from the horizontal and extended several hundred kilometers into the Earth. These zones later became known as Wadati–Benioff zones, or simply Benioff zones, in honor of the seismologists who first recognized them, [[Kiyoo Wadati]] of Japan and [[Hugo Benioff]] of the United States. The study of global seismicity greatly advanced in the 1960s with the establishment of the Worldwide Standardized Seismograph Network (WWSSN)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|Wysession|2009|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; to monitor the compliance of the 1963 treaty banning above-ground testing of nuclear weapons. The much improved data from the WWSSN instruments allowed seismologists to map precisely the zones of earthquake concentration worldwide.

Meanwhile, debates developed around the phenomena of polar wander. Since the early debates of continental drift, scientists had discussed and used evidence that polar drift had occurred because continents seemed to have moved through different climatic zones during the past. Furthermore, paleomagnetic data had shown that the magnetic pole had also shifted during time. Reasoning in an opposite way, the continents might have shifted and rotated, while the pole remained relatively fixed. The first time the evidence of magnetic polar wander was used to support the movements of continents was in a paper by [[Keith Runcorn]] in 1956,{{sfn|Runcorn|1956}} and successive papers by him and his students [[Ted Irving]] (who was actually the first to be convinced of the fact that paleomagnetism supported continental drift) and Ken Creer.

This was immediately followed by a symposium in [[Tasmania]] in March 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carey|1956}}; see also {{Harvnb|Quilty|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this symposium, the evidence was used in the theory of an [[expanding Earth|expansion of the global crust]]. In this hypothesis the shifting of the continents can be simply explained by a large increase in size of the Earth since its formation. However, this was unsatisfactory because its supporters could offer no convincing mechanism to produce a significant expansion of the Earth. Certainly there is no evidence that the moon has expanded in the past 3 billion years; other work would soon show that the evidence was equally in support of continental drift on a globe with a stable radius.

During the thirties up to the late fifties, works by [[Felix Andries Vening Meinesz|Vening-Meinesz]], Holmes, [[Johannes Herman Frederik Umbgrove|Umbgrove]], and numerous others outlined concepts that were close or nearly identical to modern plate tectonics theory. In particular, the English geologist Arthur Holmes proposed in 1920 that plate junctions might lie beneath the [[sea]], and in 1928 that convection currents within the mantle might be the driving force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmes|1928}}; see also {{Harvnb|Holmes|1978}}, {{Harvnb|Frankel|1978}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Often, these contributions are forgotten because:
*At the time, continental drift was not accepted.
*Some of these ideas were discussed in the context of abandoned fixistic ideas of a deforming globe without continental drift or an expanding Earth.
*They were published during an episode of extreme political and economic instability that hampered scientific communication.
*Many were published by European scientists and at first not mentioned or given little credit in the papers on sea floor spreading published by the American researchers in the 1960s.

===Mid-oceanic ridge spreading and convection===
{{Details|topic=Mid-ocean ridge|Seafloor spreading}}

In 1947, a team of scientists led by [[Maurice Ewing]] utilizing the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]]'s research vessel ''Atlantis'' and an array of instruments, confirmed the existence of a rise in the central Atlantic Ocean, and found that the floor of the seabed beneath the layer of sediments consisted of basalt, not the granite which is the main constituent of continents. They also found that the oceanic crust was much thinner than continental crust. All these new findings raised important and intriguing questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lippsett|2001}}, {{Harvnb|Lippsett|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new data that had been collected on the ocean basins also showed particular characteristics regarding the bathymetry. One of the major outcomes of these datasets was that all along the globe, a system of mid-oceanic ridges was detected. An important conclusion was that along this system, new ocean floor was being created, which led to the concept of the "[[Great Global Rift]]". This was described in the crucial paper of [[Bruce C. Heezen|Bruce Heezen]] (1960),{{sfn|Heezen|1960}} which would trigger a real revolution in thinking. A profound consequence of seafloor spreading is that new crust was, and still is, being continually created along the oceanic ridges. Therefore, Heezen advocated the so-called "[[expanding Earth]]" hypothesis of S. Warren Carey (see above). So, still the question remained: how can new crust be continuously added along the oceanic ridges without increasing the size of the Earth? In reality, this question had been solved already by numerous scientists during the forties and the fifties, like Arthur Holmes, Vening-Meinesz, Coates and many others: The crust in excess disappeared along what were called the oceanic trenches, where so-called "subduction" occurred. Therefore, when various scientists during the early sixties started to reason on the data at their disposal regarding the ocean floor, the pieces of the theory quickly fell into place.

The question particularly intrigued [[Harry Hammond Hess]], a [[Princeton University]] geologist and a Naval Reserve Rear Admiral, and [[Robert S. Dietz]], a scientist with the [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]] who first coined the term ''seafloor spreading''. Dietz and Hess (the former published the same idea one year earlier in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'',{{sfn|Dietz|1961}} but priority belongs to Hess who had already distributed an unpublished manuscript of his 1962 article by 1960){{sfn|Hess|1962}} were among the small handful who really understood the broad implications of sea floor spreading and how it would eventually agree with the, at that time, unconventional and unaccepted ideas of continental drift and the elegant and mobilistic models proposed by previous workers like Holmes.

In the same year, [[Robert R. Coats]] of the U.S. Geological Survey described the main features of [[island arc]] subduction in the [[Aleutian Islands]]. His paper, though little noted (and even ridiculed) at the time, has since been called "seminal" and "prescient". In reality, it actually shows that the work by the European scientists on island arcs and mountain belts performed and published during the 1930s up until the 1950s was applied and appreciated also in the United States.

If the Earth's crust was expanding along the oceanic ridges, Hess and Dietz reasoned like Holmes and others before them, it must be shrinking elsewhere. Hess followed Heezen, suggesting that new oceanic crust continuously spreads away from the ridges in a conveyor belt–like motion. And, using the mobilistic concepts developed before, he correctly concluded that many millions of years later, the oceanic crust eventually descends along the continental margins where oceanic trenches – very deep, narrow canyons – are formed, e.g. along [[Pacific Ring of Fire|the rim of the Pacific Ocean basin]]. The important step Hess made was that convection currents would be the driving force in this process, arriving at the same conclusions as Holmes had decades before with the only difference that the thinning of the ocean crust was performed using Heezen's mechanism of spreading along the ridges. Hess therefore concluded that the Atlantic Ocean was expanding while the [[Pacific Ocean]] was shrinking. As old oceanic crust is "consumed" in the trenches (like Holmes and others, he thought this was done by thickening of the continental lithosphere, not, as now understood, by underthrusting at a larger scale of the oceanic crust itself into the mantle), new magma rises and erupts along the spreading ridges to form new crust. In effect, the ocean basins are perpetually being "recycled," with the creation of new crust and the destruction of old oceanic lithosphere occurring simultaneously. Thus, the new mobilistic concepts neatly explained why the Earth does not get bigger with sea floor spreading, why there is so little sediment accumulation on the ocean floor, and why oceanic rocks are much younger than continental rocks.

===Magnetic striping===
[[File:Oceanic.Stripe.Magnetic.Anomalies.Scheme.svg|thumb|Seafloor magnetic striping.]]
[[File:Polarityshift.gif|thumb|A demonstration of magnetic striping. (The darker the color is, the closer it is to normal polarity)]]
{{Details|Vine–Matthews–Morley hypothesis}}

Beginning in the 1950s, scientists like [[Victor Vacquier]], using magnetic instruments ([[magnetometer]]s) adapted from airborne devices developed during [[World War II]] to detect [[submarine]]s, began recognizing odd magnetic variations across the ocean floor. This finding, though unexpected, was not entirely surprising because it was known that basalt—the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor—contains a strongly magnetic mineral ([[magnetite]]) and can locally distort compass readings. This distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners as early as the late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these newly discovered magnetic variations provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials recorded the [[Earth's magnetic field]] at the time.

As more and more of the seafloor was mapped during the 1950s, the magnetic variations turned out not to be random or isolated occurrences, but instead revealed recognizable patterns. When these magnetic patterns were mapped over a wide region, the ocean floor showed a [[zebra]]-like pattern: one stripe with normal polarity and the adjoining stripe with reversed polarity. The overall pattern, defined by these alternating bands of normally and reversely polarized rock, became known as magnetic striping, and was published by [[Ron G. Mason]] and co-workers in 1961, who did not find, though, an explanation for these data in terms of sea floor spreading, like Vine, Matthews and Morley a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|Raff|1961}}, {{Harvnb|Raff|Mason|1961}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of magnetic striping called for an explanation. In the early 1960s scientists such as Heezen, Hess and Dietz had begun to theorise that mid-ocean ridges mark structurally weak zones where the ocean floor was being ripped in two lengthwise along the ridge crest (see the previous paragraph). New [[magma]] from deep within the Earth rises easily through these weak zones and eventually erupts along the crest of the ridges to create new oceanic crust. This process, at first denominated the "conveyer belt hypothesis" and later called seafloor spreading, operating over many millions of years continues to form new ocean floor all across the 50,000&amp;nbsp;km-long system of mid-ocean ridges.

Only four years after the maps with the "zebra pattern" of magnetic stripes were published, the link between sea floor spreading and these patterns was correctly placed, independently by [[Lawrence Morley]], and by [[Fred Vine]] and [[Drummond Matthews]], in 1963,{{sfn|Vine|Matthews|1963}} now called the [[Vine-Matthews-Morley hypothesis]]. This hypothesis linked these patterns to geomagnetic reversals and was supported by several lines of evidence:&lt;ref&gt;See summary in {{Harvnb|Heirzler|Le Pichon|Baron|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# the stripes are symmetrical around the crests of the mid-ocean ridges; at or near the crest of the ridge, the rocks are very young, and they become progressively older away from the ridge crest;
# the youngest rocks at the ridge crest always have present-day (normal) polarity;
# stripes of rock parallel to the ridge crest alternate in magnetic polarity (normal-reversed-normal, etc.), suggesting that they were formed during different epochs documenting the (already known from independent studies) normal and reversal episodes of the Earth's magnetic field.

By explaining both the zebra-like magnetic striping and the construction of the mid-ocean ridge system, the seafloor spreading hypothesis (SFS) quickly gained converts and represented another major advance in the development of the plate-tectonics theory. Furthermore, the oceanic crust now came to be appreciated as a natural "tape recording" of the history of the geomagnetic field reversals (GMFR) of the Earth's magnetic field. Today, extensive studies are dedicated to the calibration of the normal-reversal patterns in the oceanic crust on one hand and known timescales derived from the dating of basalt layers in sedimentary sequences ([[magnetostratigraphy]]) on the other, to arrive at estimates of past spreading rates and plate reconstructions.

===Definition and refining of the theory===
After all these considerations, Plate Tectonics (or, as it was initially called "New Global Tectonics") became quickly accepted in the scientific world, and numerous papers followed that defined the concepts:
*In 1965, [[Tuzo Wilson]] who had been a promotor of the sea floor spreading hypothesis and continental drift from the very beginning{{sfn|Wilson|1963}} added the concept of [[transform fault]]s to the model, completing the classes of fault types necessary to make the mobility of the plates on the globe work out.{{sfn|Wilson|1965}}
*A symposium on continental drift was held at the Royal Society of London in 1965 which must be regarded as the official start of the acceptance of plate tectonics by the scientific community, and which abstracts are issued as {{Harvtxt|Blackett|Bullard|Runcorn|1965}}. In this symposium, [[Edward Bullard]] and co-workers showed with a computer calculation how the continents along both sides of the Atlantic would best fit to close the ocean, which became known as the famous "Bullard's Fit".
*In 1966 Wilson published the paper that referred to previous plate tectonic reconstructions, introducing the concept of what is now known as the "[[Wilson Cycle]]".{{sfn|Wilson|1966}}
*In 1967, at the [[American Geophysical Union]]'s meeting, [[W. Jason Morgan]] proposed that the Earth's surface consists of 12 rigid plates that move relative to each other.{{sfn|Morgan|1968}}
*Two months later, [[Xavier Le Pichon]] published a complete model based on 6 major plates with their relative motions, which marked the final acceptance by the scientific community of plate tectonics.{{sfn|Le Pichon|1967}}
*In the same year, [[Dan McKenzie (geophysicist)|McKenzie]] and Parker independently presented a model similar to Morgan's using translations and rotations on a sphere to define the plate motions.{{sfn|McKenzie|Parker|1967}}

===Plate Tectonics Revolution===
{{main|Plate Tectonics Revolution}}
The Plate Tectonics Revolution was the scientific and cultural change which developed from the acceptance of the [[plate tectonics]] theory. The event was a [[paradigm shift]] and scientific revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casadevall|first1=Arturo|last2=Fang|first2=Ferric C.|title=Revolutionary Science|journal=mBio  |date=1 March 2016|volume=7|issue=2|pages=e00158–16|doi=10.1128/mBio.00158-16|pmid=26933052|pmc=4810483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for biogeography==
Continental drift theory helps biogeographers to explain the disjunct [[biogeography|biogeographic]] distribution of present-day life found on different continents but having [[Common descent|similar ancestors]].{{sfn|Moss|Wilson|1998}} In particular, it explains the Gondwanan distribution of [[ratite]]s and the [[Antarctic flora]].

==Plate reconstruction==
{{Main|Plate reconstruction}}
Reconstruction is used to establish past (and future) plate configurations, helping determine the shape and make-up of ancient supercontinents and providing a basis for paleogeography.

===Defining plate boundaries===
Current plate boundaries are defined by their seismicity.{{sfn|Condie|1997}} Past plate boundaries within existing plates are identified from a variety of evidence, such as the presence of [[ophiolites]] that are indicative of vanished oceans.{{sfn|Lliboutry|2000}}

===Past plate motions===
Tectonic motion is believed to have begun around 3 to 3.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Kranendonk2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kranendonk |first1= V. |last2= Martin |first2= J. |title= Onset of Plate Tectonics |doi= 10.1126/science.1208766 |journal= Science |volume= 333 |issue= 6041 |pages= 413–14 |year= 2011 |pmid= 21778389 |pmc= |bibcode= 2011Sci...333..413V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.livescience.com/60478-plate-tectonics-gets-new-age.html Plate Tectonics May Have Begun a Billion Years After Earth's Birth Pappas, S LiveScience report of PNAS research 21 Sept 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;{{why|date=December 2014}}

Various types of quantitative and semi-quantitative information are available to constrain past plate motions. The geometric fit between continents, such as between west Africa and South America is still an important part of plate reconstruction. Magnetic stripe patterns provide a reliable guide to relative plate motions going back into the [[Jurassic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geodynamics.no/GMAP/Methods/Introduction_to_Methods.htm |title=Reconstruction Methods |last=Torsvik |first=Trond Helge |accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tracks of hotspots give absolute reconstructions, but these are only available back to the [[Cretaceous]].{{sfn|Torsvik|2008}} Older reconstructions rely mainly on paleomagnetic pole data, although these only constrain the latitude and rotation, but not the longitude. Combining poles of different ages in a particular plate to produce apparent polar wander paths provides a method for comparing the motions of different plates through time.{{sfn|Butler|1992}} Additional evidence comes from the distribution of certain [[sedimentary rock]] types,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotese.com/climate.htm |title=Climate History |last=Scotese |first=C.R. |date=2002-04-20 |website=Paleomap Project |accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; faunal provinces shown by particular fossil groups, and the position of [[orogeny|orogenic belts]].{{sfn|Torsvik|2008}}

===Formation and break-up of continents===
The movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a [[supercontinent]] that contains most or all of the continents. The supercontinent [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]] or Nuna formed during a period of {{Ma|2000|1800}} and broke up about {{Ma|1500|1300}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|last=Zhao|year=2002|year2=2004|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supercontinent [[Rodinia]] is thought to have formed about 1 billion years ago and to have embodied most or all of Earth's continents, and broken up into eight continents around {{Ma|600}}. The eight continents later re-assembled into another supercontinent called [[Pangaea]]; Pangaea broke up into [[Laurasia]] (which became North America and Eurasia) and [[Gondwana]] (which became the remaining continents).

The [[Himalayas]], the world's tallest mountain range, are assumed to have been formed by the collision of two major plates. Before uplift, they were covered by the [[Tethys Ocean]].

==Current plates==
{{Main|List of tectonic plates}}
[[File:Plate tectonics map.gif|frameless|upright=2.25|right|Plate tectonics map]]

Depending on how they are defined, there are usually seven or eight "major" plates: [[African Plate|African]], [[Antarctic Plate|Antarctic]], [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]], [[North American Plate|North American]], [[South American Plate|South American]], [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]], and [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian]]. The latter is sometimes subdivided into the [[Indian Plate|Indian]] and [[Australian Plate|Australian]] plates.

There are dozens of smaller plates, the seven largest of which are the [[Arabian Plate|Arabian]], [[Caribbean Plate|Caribbean]], [[Juan de Fuca Plate|Juan de Fuca]], [[Cocos Plate|Cocos]], [[Nazca Plate|Nazca]], [[Philippine Sea Plate|Philippine Sea]], and [[Scotia Plate|Scotia]].

The current motion of the tectonic plates is today determined by remote sensing satellite data sets, calibrated with ground station measurements.

==Other celestial bodies (planets, moons)==
The appearance of plate tectonics on [[terrestrial planet]]s is related to planetary mass, with [[super-Earth|more massive planets than Earth]] expected to exhibit plate tectonics. Earth may be a borderline case, owing its tectonic activity to abundant water {{sfn|Valencia|O'Connell|Sasselov|2007}} (silica and water form a deep [[eutectic]]).

===Venus===
{{See also|Geology of Venus}}
Venus shows no evidence of active plate tectonics. There is debatable evidence of active tectonics in the planet's distant past; however, events taking place since then (such as the plausible and generally accepted hypothesis that the Venusian lithosphere has thickened greatly over the course of several hundred million years) has made constraining the course of its geologic record difficult. However, the numerous well-preserved [[impact crater]]s have been utilized as a [[dating methods|dating method]] to approximately date the Venusian surface (since there are thus far no known samples of Venusian rock to be dated by more reliable methods). Dates derived are dominantly in the range {{Ma|500|750}}, although ages of up to {{Ma|1200}} have been calculated. This research has led to the fairly well accepted hypothesis that Venus has undergone an essentially complete volcanic resurfacing at least once in its distant past, with the last event taking place approximately within the range of estimated surface ages. While the mechanism of such an impressive thermal event remains a debated issue in Venusian geosciences, some scientists are advocates of processes involving plate motion to some extent.

One explanation for Venus's lack of plate tectonics is that on Venus temperatures are too high for significant water to be present.{{sfn|Kasting|1988}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/venus_life_040826.html |title=Was Venus alive? "The Signs are Probably There" |last=Bortman |first=Henry |date=2004-08-26 |accessdate=2008-01-08 |publisher=Astrobiology Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth's crust is soaked with water, and water plays an important role in the development of [[shear zone]]s. Plate tectonics requires weak surfaces in the crust along which crustal slices can move, and it may well be that such weakening never took place on Venus because of the absence of water. However, some researchers{{Who|date=January 2016}} remain convinced that plate tectonics is or was once active on this planet.

===Mars===
{{See also|Geology of Mars}}
Mars is considerably smaller than Earth and Venus, and there is evidence for ice on its surface and in its crust.

In the 1990s, it was proposed that [[Martian dichotomy|Martian Crustal Dichotomy]] was created by plate tectonic processes.{{sfn|Sleep|1994}} Scientists today disagree, and think that it was created either by upwelling within the Martian [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] that thickened the crust of the Southern Highlands and formed [[Tharsis]]{{sfn|Zhong|Zuber|2001}} or by a giant impact that excavated the [[Vastitas Borealis|Northern Lowlands]].{{sfn|Andrews-Hanna|Zuber|Banerdt|2008}}

[[Valles Marineris]] may be a tectonic boundary.&lt;ref name="tectonic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/ucla-scientist-discovers-plate-237303.aspx?link_page_rss=237303 |title=UCLA scientist discovers plate tectonics on Mars |publisher=UCLA |website=Yin, An |date=August 9, 2012 |accessdate=August 13, 2012 |author=Wolpert, Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observations made of the magnetic field of Mars by the ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]'' spacecraft in 1999 showed patterns of magnetic striping discovered on this planet. Some scientists interpreted these as requiring plate tectonic processes, such as seafloor spreading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Connerney|Acuña|Wasilewski|Ness|1999}}, {{Harvnb|Connerney|Acuña|Ness|Kletetschka|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their data fail a "magnetic reversal test", which is used to see if they were formed by flipping polarities of a global magnetic field.{{sfn|Harrison|2000}}

===Icy satellites===
Some of the [[Galilean satellites|satellites]] of [[Jupiter]] have features that may be related to plate-tectonic style deformation, although the materials and specific mechanisms may be different from plate-tectonic activity on Earth. On 8 September 2014, NASA reported finding evidence of plate tectonics on [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], a satellite of Jupiter—the first sign of subduction activity on another world other than Earth.&lt;ref name="NASA-20140908"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dyches |first=Preston |last2=Brown |first2=Dwayne |last3=Buckley |first3=Michael |title=Scientists Find Evidence of 'Diving' Tectonic Plates on Europa |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-300 |date=8 September 2014 |website=[[NASA]] |accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the largest moon of [[Saturn]], was reported to show tectonic activity in images taken by the [[Huygens (spacecraft)|''Huygens'' probe]], which landed on Titan on January 14, 2005.{{sfn|Soderblom|Tomasko|Archinal|Becker|2007}}

===Exoplanets===
On Earth-sized planets, plate tectonics is more likely if there are oceans of water. However, in 2007, two independent teams of researchers came to opposing conclusions about the likelihood of plate tectonics on larger [[super-Earth]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Valencia |first1= Diana |last2= O'Connell |first2= Richard J. |title= Convection scaling and subduction on Earth and super-Earths |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X09004178 |journal= Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume= 286 |issue= 3–4 |pages= 492–502 |doi= 10.1016/j.epsl.2009.07.015 |bibcode=2009E&amp;PSL.286..492V |year= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= van Heck |first1= H.

Lenardic [http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2007/2007GL030598.shtml Geological consequences of super-sized Earths] ''Geophysical Research Letters'' 34: L19204 {{DOI|10.1029/2007GL030598}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other team saying that plate tectonics is very likely on super-earths even if the planet is dry.{{sfn|Valencia|O'Connell|Sasselov|2007}}

Consideration of plate tectonics is a part of the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] and [[extraterrestrial life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=Robert J.|title=Is plate tectonics needed to evolve technological species on exoplanets?|journal=Geoscience Frontiers|date=July 2016|volume=7|issue=4|pages=573–580|doi=10.1016/j.gsf.2015.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geology]], '''plating''' is a hypothesized process whereby [[asthenosphere|asthenospheric]] [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] hardens beneath [[Crust (geology)|crustal]] material, thereby becoming attached to it and thereafter moving together with the crustal material as part of the [[lithosphere]].&lt;ref name=PLB1&gt;{{cite book|title=Allgemeine Geologie|page=23 f.|isbn=978 3 662 48341 1|language=de| author=Frank Press,  Raymond Siever, John Grotzinger, Thomas Jordan, Volker Schweizer|location=Berlin, Heidelberg |publisher= Springer Spektrum|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A complementary process, although it does not necessarily always involve the upper mantle, is called [[delamination (geology)|delamination]].

'''''Power Hungry: The Myths of "Green" Energy and the Real Fuels of the Future'''''  is a book by [[Robert Bryce (writer)|Robert Bryce]] about energy, mainly from a United States perspective.&lt;ref name="A Few Thoughts on Power Hungry by Robert Bryce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerpielkejr.blogspot.com/2010/05/few-thoughts-on-power-hungry-by-robert.html|title=A Few Thoughts on "Power Hungry" by Robert Bryce|last=[[Roger Pielke, Jr.|Pielke Jr, Roger]]|date=13 May 2010|publisher=Roger Pielke Jr's Blog|accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was published in 2010 by [[PublicAffairs]]. A short essay based on the book was released as an [[op-ed]] by the author in ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name="Five myths about green energy"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/23/AR2010042302220.html|title=Five myths about green energy|last=Bryce|first=Robert|date=April 25, 2010|work=Washington Post|publisher=Washington Post|page=1|accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
As in his earlier book ''[[Gusher of Lies]]'' (which was about the idea of [[North American energy independence|energy independence]]), Bryce argues that the United States needs to continue to use large amounts of [[fossil fuels]] including imported oil.
However he does contemplate ways in which reliance on fossil fuels might be reduced:
* Energy efficiency: Bryce claims that the United States' record in improving energy efficiency puts it in the top three of the developed countries,&lt;ref name="Five myths about green energy"/&gt; and he explains the relatively high ''per capita'' energy consumption by arguing that the country is not "addicted to oil", as stated by [[George W. Bush]],&lt;ref&gt;The State of the Union: A Look Between the Lines, NPR https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5181934&lt;/ref&gt; but addicted to prosperity.
* The use of [[nuclear power]]

Bryce argues that some renewable sources, such as [[wind farms]], are not truly green and that [[carbon capture and storage]] will not work and will prove to be an expensive mistake.

==Reception==
Trevor Butterworth writing in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' praised ''Power Hungry'' as a "brutal, brilliant exploration" of the quest for green energy.&lt;ref name="Trevor Butterworth"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703465204575208132724528718|title=The Wrong Way To Get to Green|last=Butterworth|first=Trevor|date=April 30, 2010|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Tucker writing for ''[[The American Spectator]]'' said that ''Power Hungry'' is filled with little tidbits that "make endlessly fascinating reading. For instance, In 1971 we consumed twice as much energy from natural gas as from coal, but coal made a comeback under Carter and overtook natural gas in 1986".&lt;ref name="William Tucker"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://spectator.org/archives/2010/04/26/november-energy-futures|title=November Energy Futures|last=Tucker|first=William |date=April 26, 2010|publisher=[[The American Spectator]]|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger A. Pielke, Jr.]] wrote on his blog, "Bryce's book is generally well-written and well-argued, if sprawling and at times more pastiche than systematic argument. His book has three parts. The first surveys our demand for energy and why it is inevitably going to increase. The second seeks to dispel a slew of "myths" about green energy—13 myths in all".&lt;ref name="A Few Thoughts on Power Hungry by Robert Bryce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerpielkejr.blogspot.com/2010/05/few-thoughts-on-power-hungry-by-robert.html|title=A Few Thoughts on "Power Hungry" by Robert Bryce|last=Pielke, Jr|first=Roger|date=13 May 2010|publisher=Roger Pielke Jr|accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proserpina''' ({{IPAc-en|p|r|oʊ|ˈ|s|ɜr|p|ɪ|n|ə}}; {{Lang-la|Prōserpina}} {{IPA-la|proː.ˈsɛr.pɪ.na|}})&lt;ref name="collins_american"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/proserpina |title=American English Dictionary: Definition of Proserpina |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Proserpine''' ({{IPAc-en|p|r|oʊ|ˈ|s|ɜr|p|ɪ|ˌ|n|i|,_|ˈ|p|r|ɒ|s|ər|ˌ|p|aɪ|n}})&lt;ref name="collins_american" /&gt; is an ancient Roman [[goddess]] whose cult, myths and mysteries were combined from those of '''Libera''', and early Roman goddess of wine, and the Greek [[Persephone]] and [[Demeter]], goddesses of grain and agriculture. The originally Roman goddess Libera was daughter of the agricultural goddess [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and wife to [[Liber]], god of wine and freedom. In 204 BC, a new [[Ritus graecus|"greek-style" cult]] to Ceres and Proserpina as "Mother and Maiden" was imported from southern Italy, along with Greek priestesses to serve it, and was installed in Libera and Ceres' temple on Rome's Aventine Hill. The new cult and its priesthood were actively promoted by Rome's religious authorities as [[Mos maiorum|morally desirable]] for respectable Roman women, and may have partly subsumed the temple's older, native cult to [[Aventine Triad|Ceres, Liber and Libera]]; but the new rites seem to have functioned alongside the old, rather than replaced them.

Just as Persephone was thought to be a daughter of [[Demeter]], Romans made Proserpina a daughter of Demeter's Roman equivalent, [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]]. Like Persephone, Proserpina is associated with the underworld realm and its ruler; and along with her mother Ceres, with the springtime growth of crops and the cycle of life, death and rebirth or renewal. Her name is a Latinisation of "Persephone", perhaps influenced by the Latin ''proserpere'' ("to emerge, to creep forth"), with respect to the growing of grain. Her core myths – her [[Persephone#Abduction myth|forcible abduction]] by the [[Pluto (mythology)|god of the Underworld]], her mother's search for her and her eventual but temporary restoration to the world above – are the subject of works in [[Roman art|Roman]] and later art and literature. In particular, Proserpina's seizure by the god of the Underworld – usually described as the Rape of Proserpina, or of Persephone – has offered dramatic subject matter for [[Renaissance]] and later sculptors and painters.

== Cult and myths ==
===Origin as Libera===
In early Roman religion, Libera was the female equivalent of [[Liber]] (freedom). She was originally an [[Italic peoples|Italic]] goddess; at some time during Rome's Regal or very early Republican eras, she was paired with [[Liber]], also known as Liber Pater (The Free Father), Roman god of wine, male fertility, and a guardian of [[plebeian]] freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;Barbette Stanley Spaeth, ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, p. 8: the pairing of Libera and Liber identifies both as aspects of an "etymological duality" &amp;ndash; cf Roman [[Faunus]] and [[Fauna (goddess)|Fauna]].&lt;/ref&gt; She enters Roman history as part of a [[Aventine Triad|Triadic cult]] alongside [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and Liber, in a temple established on the [[Aventine Hill]] around 493 BCE. The location and context of this early cult mark her association with Rome's commoner-citizens, or [[plebs]]; she might have been offered cult on March 17 as part of Liber's festival, [[Liberalia]], or at some time during the seven days of [[Cerealia]] (mid- to late April); in the latter festival, she would have been subordinate to Ceres. Otherwise, her relationship to her Aventine cult partners is uncertain; she has no known native mythology.

Libera was officially identified with Proserpina in 205 BCE, when she acquired a Romanised form of the Greek mystery rites and their attendant mythology. In the late Republican era, [[Cicero]] described Liber and Libera as Ceres' children. At around the same time, possibly in the context of popular or religious drama, [[Hyginus]] equated her with Greek [[Ariadne]], as bride to Liber's Greek equivalent, [[Dionysus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[T. P. Wiseman]], "Satyrs in Rome? The Background to Horace's Ars Poetica", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 78 (1988), p 7, note 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The older and newer forms of her cult and rites, and their diverse associations, persisted well into the late Imperial era. [[St. Augustine]] (AD 354 – 430) observed that Libera is concerned with female fertility, as Liber is with male fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Barbette Stanley Spaeth, ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, p. 131, citing Cicero, ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'', 2.62, and Saint Augustine, ''[[De Civitate Dei]]'', 4.11, who most likely use the Late Republican polymath [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] as their source.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cult ===
Proserpina was officially introduced to Rome around 205 BCE, along with the ''[[Ceres (mythology)#Middle Republic|ritus graecia cereris]]'' (a Greek form of cult dedicated to her mother Ceres), as part of Rome's general religious recruitment of deities as allies against Carthage, towards the end of the [[Second Punic War]]. The cult originated in southern Italy (part of [[Magna Graecia]]) and was probably based on the women-only Greek [[Thesmophoria]], a mystery cult to [[Demeter]] and Persephone as "Mother and Maiden". It arrived along with its Greek priestesses, who were granted [[Roman citizenship]] so that they could pray to the gods "with a foreign and external knowledge, but with a domestic and civil intention".&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, Barbette Stanley, ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, pp. 4, 6–13, citing [[Arnobius]], who mistakes this as the first Roman cult to Ceres. His belief may reflect its high profile and ubiquity during the later Imperial period, and possibly the fading of older, distinctively Aventine forms of her cult.&lt;/ref&gt; The new cult was installed in the already ancient Temple of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], [[Liber]] and [[Libera (mythology)|Libera]], Rome's [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] patrons of the [[plebs]]; from the end of the 3rd century BC, Demeter's temple at [[Enna]], in [[Sicily]], was acknowledged as Ceres' oldest, most authoritative cult centre, and Libera was recognised as Proserpina, Roman equivalent to Demeter's daughter [[Persephone]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Scheid|Scheid, John]], "Graeco Ritu: A Typically Roman Way of Honoring the Gods," ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'', 97, Greece in Rome: Influence, Integration, Resistance, 1995, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; Their joint cult recalls Demeter's search for Persephone, after the latter's rape and abduction into the underworld by [[Hades]] (or [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]). At the Aventine, the new cult took its place alongside the old. It made no reference to Liber, whose open and gender-mixed cult continued to play a central role in plebeian culture, as a patron and protector of plebeian rights, freedoms and values. The exclusively female initiates and priestesses of the new "[[Ritus graecus|greek style]]" mysteries of Ceres and Proserpina were expected to uphold Rome's traditional, [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]-dominated social hierarchy and [[mos maiorum|traditional morality]]. Unmarried girls should emulate the chastity of Proserpina, the maiden; married women should seek to emulate Ceres, the devoted and fruitful Mother. Their rites were intended to secure a good harvest, and increase the fertility of those who partook in the mysteries.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, Barbette Stanley, ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, pp. 13, 15, 60, 94–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Temple of Proserpina]] was located in a suburb of [[Melite (ancient city)|Melite]], in modern [[Mtarfa]], [[Malta]]. The temple's ruins were quarried between the 17th and 18th centuries, and only a few fragments survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cardona|first1=David|title=The known unknown: identification, provenancing, and relocation of pieces of decorative architecture from Roman public buildings and other private structures in Malta|journal=Malta Archaeological Review|date=2008–2009|issue=9|url=https://www.academia.edu/8342123/The_known_unknown_identification_provenancing_and_relocation_of_pieces_of_decorative_architecture_from_Roman_public_buildings_and_other_private_structures_in_Malta|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Myths===

[[File:Aachen Raub von Proserpina.jpg|thumb|288px|The rape of Proserpina by [[Hans von Aachen]]]] 
[[Image:Cliveden-proserpina.jpg|thumb|Copy of ''The Rape of Proserpina'' by {{Interlanguage link multi|Vincenzo de' Rossi|it}}, on view near [[Cliveden House]]]]
The best-known myth surrounding Proserpina is of her abduction by the god of the Underworld, her mother Ceres' frantic search for her, and her eventual but temporary restitution to the world above. In Latin literature, several versions are known, all similar in most respects to the myths of Greek Persephone's abduction by the King of the underworld, named variously in Greek sources as Hades or Pluto. "Hades" can mean both the hidden Underworld and its king ("The hidden one"), who in early Greek versions of the myth is a dark, unsympathetic figure; Persephone is "Kore" ("The Maiden"), taken against her will;&lt;ref&gt;As in Hesiod's ''Theogony'' and the "[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Demeter]]; see Diane Rayor, ''The Homeric Hymns'', University of California Press, 2004, pp. 107–109.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Greek [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], her captor is known as Pluto; they form a divine couple who rule the underworld together, and receive Eleusinian initiates into some form of better afterlife. Renamed thus, the king of the underworld is distanced from his consort's violent abduction.&lt;ref&gt;As in the Greek [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)]] and, in Latin, [[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 146&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1st century [[Ovid]] gives two poetic versions of the myth in Latin; one in Book 5 of his ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' (Book 5) and another in Book 4 of his ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]''.&lt;ref&gt;For treatment of Ovid's two versions, and comparison with his probable Greek sources, see Stephen Hinds, ''The Metamorphosis of Persephone: Ovid and the Self-Conscious Muse'', Cambridge University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; An early 5th century Latin version of the same myth is [[Claudian]]'s ''De raptu Proserpinae''; in most cases, these Latin works identify Proserpina's underworld abductor and later consort by the Roman god of the underworld's traditional Latin name, [[Dis Pater|Dis]].

[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], in order to bring love to [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], sent her son [[Cupid|Amor]] (also known as [[Cupid]]) to hit Pluto with one of his arrows.  Proserpina was in [[Sicily]], at the [[Pergusa Lake]] near [[Enna]], where she was playing with some [[nymph]]s and collecting flowers, when Pluto came out from the [[volcano]] [[Mount Etna|Etna]] with four black horses named Orphnaeus, Aethon, Nycteus and Alastor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Claudian/De_Raptu_Proserpinae/1*.html |title=LacusCurtius • Claudian — The Rape of Proserpine: Book I |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He abducted her in order to marry her and live with her in the underworld of which he was the ruler.

Her mother [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], also known as [[Demeter]], the [[goddess]] of agriculture or of the [[Earth]], went looking for her across all of the world, and all in vain. She was unable to find anything but a small belt floating upon a little lake made from the tears of the nymphs. In her desperation, Ceres angrily stopped the growth of [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s, bestowing a [[curse|malediction]] on [[Sicily]]. Ceres refused to return to [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Mount Olympus]] and started walking the Earth, creating a [[desert]] with each step.

Worried, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] sent [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] to order Pluto (Jupiter's brother) to free Proserpina. Pluto obeyed, but before letting her go he made her eat six [[pomegranate]] seeds, because those who have eaten the food of the dead could not return to the world of the living.  This meant that she would have to live six months of each year with him, and stay the rest with her mother. This story was undoubtedly meant to illustrate the changing of the seasons: when Ceres welcomes her daughter back in the spring the earth blossoms, and when Proserpina must be returned to her husband it withers.

In another version of the story, Proserpina ate only four pomegranate seeds, and she did so of her own accord. When Jupiter ordered her return, Pluto struck a deal with Jupiter, saying that since she had stolen his pomegranate seeds, she must stay with him four months of the year in return. For this reason, in spring when Ceres receives her daughter back, the crops blossom, and in summer they flourish.

In the autumn Ceres changes the leaves to shades of brown and orange (her favorite colors) as a gift to Proserpina before she has to return to the underworld. During the time that Proserpina resides with Pluto, the world goes through winter, a time when the earth is barren.

=== Orpheus and Eurydice ===
The most extensive myth of Proserpina in Latin is [[Claudian]]'s (4th century AD). It is closely connected with that of [[Orpheus]] and [[Eurydice]]. In Virgil's Georgics, Orpheus' beloved wife, Eurydice, died from a snake-bite; Proserpina allowed Orpheus into Hades without losing his life; charmed by his music, she allowed him to lead his wife back to the land of the living, as long as he did not look back during the journey. But Orpheus could not resist a backward glance, so Eurydice was forever lost to him.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Georgics'', Book 4, 453–527, [http://poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/VirgilGeorgicsIV.htm#_Toc534524384 English translation online, by AS Kline, 2002] accessed 15 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Claudianus]] ''De Raptu Proserpinae'', on [http://www.divusangelus.it/claudianus/rapt1.htm Divus Angelus].&lt;/ref&gt;

Different grades exist (e.g. thick or viscous, soft). The viscous one is used for standard stopcocks and ground joins. The soft grade is for large stopcocks and ground joints, [[desiccator]]s, and for lower temperature use. Ramsay grease consists of [[paraffin wax]], [[vaseline]], and crude [[natural rubber]], in ratio 1:3:7 to 1:8:16. Due to the rubber content it has less tendency to flow.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry|author=Brauer, G.|date=2012|issue=sv. 1|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=9780323161275|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kaa2qeFRXmUC&amp;pg=PA29|page=29|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[dropping point]] of Leybold-brand Ramsay grease is 56&amp;nbsp;°C; its maximum service temperature is 25-30&amp;nbsp;°C. Its vapor pressure at 25&amp;nbsp;°C is 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; torr (0.013 mPa), at 38&amp;nbsp;°C it is 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; torr (13 mPa).&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vacuum Technology|author=Roth, A.|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=9780444598745|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oBqs3sr9r48C&amp;pg=PA391|page=391|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karte Ravennat.jpg|thumb|right|Map based on ''Ravenna Cosmography'']]
The '''''Ravenna Cosmography''''' ({{lang-la|Ravennatis Anonymi Cosmographia}}, {{abbr|lit.|Literally}}&amp;nbsp;"The [[Cosmography]] of the Unknown [[Ravennese]]") is a list of place-names covering the world from [[India]] to [[Ireland]], compiled by an anonymous cleric in [[Ravenna]] around {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;700. Textual evidence indicates that the author frequently used maps as his source.

==The Text==
There are three known copies of the Cosmography in existence. The Vatican Library holds a 14th-century copy, there is a 13th-century copy in Paris at the Bibliothèque Nationale, and the library at Basle University has another 14th-century copy.{{sfn |Fitzpatrick-Matthews |2013 |p=4}} The Vatican copy was used as the source for the first publication of the manuscript in 1688 by Porcheron.{{sfn |Fitzpatrick-Matthews |2013 |p=1}} The German scholar Joseph Schnetz published the text in 1940,{{sfn |Fitzpatrick-Matthews |2013 |p=123}} basing it on the Vatican and Paris editions, which he believed to be more reliable than the Basle edition. Parts of the text, notably that covering Britain, have been published by others, including Richmond and Crawford in 1949, but their document showed little regard for which of the manuscripts provided the information. However, it contained photographs of the relevant sections from all three manuscripts, which enabled Keith Fitzpatrick-Matthews to reconstruct the text from scratch in 2013 for his reassessment of its importance for British geography.{{sfn |Fitzpatrick-Matthews |2013 |p=4}} The work by Schnetz covered the whole document, and was republished in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schnetz |first1=Joseph |title=Itineraria Romana. Volumen Alterum, Ravennatis Anonymi cosmographia et Guidonis geographica |year=1940 |origyear=1990 |publisher=Teubner |location=Stuttgart |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/itineraria-romana/oclc/1560510&amp;referer=brief_results}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the three main manuscripts, the Vatican Library also holds a document containing excerpts from the Cosmography made by Riccobaldus Ferrariensis, and there is a copy of the Paris manuscript held in Leiden.{{sfn |Staab |1976 |p=27}}

The surviving texts are quite challenging. They consist of commentary and lists of names. The Vatican manuscript presents the text in two columns, with placenames being capitalised and terminated by a stop. A small number of the words have been abbreviated. The Paris manuscript also uses two columns, capitalisation and stops, but has many more abbreviations than either of the other two. The text is divided into sections by paragraph marks. The Basle manuscript only has a single column, and is more difficult to read than the others. It has more abbrebiations than the Vatican copy, but fewer than the Paris copy. There is some evidence that the author has tried to correct or clarify words which were not clear in the original, and there are no stops to separate the place names in the lists, but there are underlined headings to divide up the sections.{{sfn |Fitzpatrick-Matthews |2013 |p=4}} As an indication of the problems of dealing with the text, there are a total of 315 names in the section covering Britain. All three manuscripts agree on the spelling of 200 of these. The Basle and Vatican documents agree on the spelling of a further 50, there are 33 more common to the Basle and Paris documents, and 17 more which appear in the Paris and Vatican documents. There are 8 names for which there is no agreement between the three sources, and 7 names missing from the Paris copy where the other two agree.{{sfn |Fitzpatrick-Matthews |2013 |pp=4-5}} 

In a paper by Franz Staab, published in 1976, he noted that the original author claimed to have used works by three others, Athanarid, Heldebald and Marcomir, in the compilation of his own work. Stolte, writing in 1956, argued that the cosmography was finished around 732.{{sfn |Staab |1976 |pp=28-30}}

===British section===
The naming of places in Roman Britain has traditionally relied on Ptolemy’s [[Geography (Ptolemy)|''Geography'']], the [[Antonine Itinerary]] and the [[Tabula Peutingeriana|Peutinger Table]], as the Cosmography was seen as full of corruptions, with the ordering of the lists of placenames being haphazard. However, there are more entries in the Cosmography than in the other documents, and so it has been studied more recently.{{sfn |Fitzpatrick-Matthews |2013 |p=1}} The antiquary Gale, writing in 1709, was the first to attempt to use it as a source for Romano-British place names, but early attempts relied on the similarity between ancient and modern names, and this method was seen to be suspect by the mid-19th century. Archaeological investigations were uncovering sites that had evidence of occupation in the Roman period, and this correlation became important. The Antonine Itinerary and Richard of Cirencester's ''de Sitû Britanniae'' were increasingly used to corroborate entries, until Richard's work was found to be an 18th century hoax. The Cosmography remained relatively impenetrable until the mid-20th century.{{sfn |Fitzpatrick-Matthews |2013 |p=1}}

In 1949, Sir Ian Richmond and O G S Crawford published a paper they had originally submitted to ''Archaeologia'', which suggested that the sources for the document had included maps or road books, and that many place names described geographical features. The book was seen as a significant advance in the study both of the document and of Romano-British placenames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://doi.org/10.1017/S0009840X00174852 |first=A R |last=Burn |title=Review of The British Section of the Ravenna Cosmography |work=The Classical Review |volume=Vol 1 |issue=2 |date=June 1951 |p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis Dillemann's work, which was translated by Professor Colin Smith and published in ''Archaeologia'' in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.abebooks.co.uk/book-search/title/observations-on-chapter-v-31-britannia-in-the-ravenna-cosmography/author/dillemann-louis/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023141633/https://www.abebooks.co.uk/book-search/title/observations-on-chapter-v-31-britannia-in-the-ravenna-cosmography/author/dillemann-louis/ |archivedate=23 October 2018 |dead-url=no |title=Observations on Chapter V 31 Britannia in the Ravenna Cosmography |publisher=Abe Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first time that the theories of J Schnetz had been summarised for an English-speaking audience, while A L F Rivet and Colin Smith used their study of the document to publish '' The Place-Names of Roman Britain'' in the same year.{{sfn |Fitzpatrick-Matthews |2013 |p=1}}

Part of the diffiuclty with the text is its corruption, which probably results from the author failing to understand his sources, or not appreciating the purpose for which they were written. His original sources may have been of poor quality, resulting in many curious-looking names appearing in the lists. Equally, there are some obvious omissions, although the author was not attempting to produce a complete list of places, as his introduction states: "''In that Britain we read that there were many civitates and forts, of which we wish to name a few.''" The suggestion that he was using maps is bolstered by phrases such as "next to" which occur frequently, and at one point he states: "''where that same Britain is seen to be narrowest from Ocean to Ocean.''" Richmond and Crawford were the first to  argue that rather than being random, the named places are often clustered around a central point, or spread out along a single road. For most of England, the order seems to follow a series of zig-zags, but this arrangement is less obvious for the south-west and for Scotland.{{sfn |Fitzpatrick-Matthews |2013 |pp=2-3}}

The [[developing nations]] of [[Africa]] are popular locations for the application of [[renewable energy]] technology. Currently, many nations already have small-scale solar, wind, and geothermal devices in operation providing energy to urban and rural populations. These types of energy production are especially useful in remote locations because of the excessive cost of transporting electricity from large-scale power plants. The applications of renewable energy technology has the potential to alleviate many of the problems that face Africans every day, especially if done in a [[sustainability|sustainable]] manner that prioritizes human rights.

Access to energy is essential for the reduction of poverty and promotion of [[economic growth]]. Communication technologies, education, industrialization, agricultural improvement and expansion of municipal water systems all require abundant, reliable, and cost-effective energy access.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/reports/global/2001/en/ The Human Development Report 2001], United Nations Development Programme&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avoiding fossil fuels==
{{See also|Global warming|Peak oil|Energy security}}
By investing in the long-term energy solutions that [[alternative energy]] sources afford, most African nations would benefit significantly in the longer term by avoiding the pending economic problems developed countries are currently facing.

Although in many ways [[fossil fuels]] provide a simple, easy to use energy source that powered the industrialization of most modern nations, the issues associated with the widespread use of fossil fuels are now numerous, consisting of some of the world's most difficult and large-scale global political, economic, health and environmental problems. The looming [[energy crisis]] results from consuming these fossil fuels at a rate which is unsustainable, with the global demand for fossil fuels expected to increase every year for the next several decades, compounding existing problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233843/http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |date=27 May 2008 }}, M.K. Hubbert.&lt;/ref&gt;

While a great number of projects are currently underway to expand and connect the existing grid networks,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eskom.co.za/annreport06/directorrep1.htm Annual Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007020839/http://www.eskom.co.za/annreport06/directorrep1.htm |date=7 October 2007 }}, Page 2, Eskom (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; too many problems exist to make this a realistic option for the vast majority of people in Africa, especially those who live in rural locations. [[Distributed generation]] using renewable energy systems is the only practical solution to meet [[rural electrification]]&lt;!--presumably rural, not urban as per the original text--&gt; needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irn.org/programs/bujagali/index.php?id=010404.ifcbujagali.html Letter to International Finance Corporation], Woicke P.

(2000)&lt;/ref&gt; There is a move towards energy decentralisation in African nations, with many looking towards variants of energy decentralisation frameworks, such as District Energy Officers, for example as described in a recommendations paper for District Energy Officers for the country of Malawi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pure.strath.ac.uk/portal/files/67933569/Buckland_etal_2017_Malawi_district_energy_officer_blueprint_recommendations_paper.pdf Malawi District Energy Officer Blueprint: Recommendations Paper], Buckland et al. (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewable energy resources==
{{See also|Renewable energy}}
Hydro-electric, wind and solar power all derive their energy from the Sun. The Sun emits more energy in one second (3.827 × 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; J) than is available in all of the fossil fuels present on earth (3.9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; J),&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia article on [[orders of magnitude (energy)]]&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore has the potential to provide all of our current and future global energy requirements. Since the solar source for renewable energy is clean and free, African nations can protect their people, their environment, and their future economic development by using renewable energy sources&lt;ref&gt;[http://srb.stanford.edu/nur/GP200A%20Papers/zane_jobe_paper.pdf Alternative energy sources for electricity generation: Their 'energy effectiveness' and their viability for undeveloped and developing countries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613203925/http://srb.stanford.edu/nur/GP200A%20Papers/zane_jobe_paper.pdf |date=13 June 2007 }}, Jobe Z. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; to this end they have a number of possible options.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.civilg8.ru/1226.php 8th Pan African Power Congress Hearing Summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar resources===
{{see also|Solar power in Africa}}

[[File:SolarGIS-Solar-map-World-map-en.png|thumbnail|left|World map of global solar horizontal irradiation]]

Africa is the sunniest continent on Earth, especially as there are many perpetually sunny areas like the huge [[Sahara Desert]]. It has much greater solar resources than any other continent. Desert regions stand up as the most sunshiny while rainforests are considerably cloudier but still get a good global solar irradiation because of the proximity with the equator. 

The distribution of solar resources across Africa is fairly uniform, with more than 85% of the continent's landscape receiving at least 2,000 kWh/(m² year). A recent study indicates that a solar generating facility covering just 0.3% of the area comprising North Africa could supply all of the energy required by the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trecers.net/downloads/med-csp_en.pdf Report on Solar Power Potential] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023047/http://www.trecers.net/downloads/med-csp_en.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }}, German Aerospace Center&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the same land area as the state of [[Maine]].

===Wave and wind resources===
Africa has a large coastline, where [[wind power]] and [[wave power]] resources are abundant and underutilized in the north and south. [[Geothermal power]] has potential to provide considerable amounts of energy in many eastern African nations.&lt;ref name="GeoPotEA"&gt;[http://www.esi-africa.com/last/esi_2_2003/032_38.htm Geothermal Potential in East Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind is far less uniformly distributed than solar resources, with optimal locations positioned near special topographical funneling features close to coastal locations, mountain ranges, and other natural channels in the north and south. The availability of wind on the western coast of Africa is substantial, exceeding 3,750&amp;nbsp;kW·h, and will accommodate the future prospect for energy demands&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saharawind.com/ Background Information], Sahara Wind.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassedy, Edward S. Prospects for Sustainable Energy: A Critical Assessment. New York Cambridge UP, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Central Africa has lower than average wind resources to work with.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afriwea.org/en/summary.htm African Wind Energy Association Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522021227/http://www.afriwea.org/en/summary.htm |date=22 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geothermal resources===
[[Image:Africa6 006.jpg|thumb|The Rift Valley near Eldoret, Kenya]]
Geothermal power is mostly concentrated in eastern Africa, but there are many fragmented spots of high intensity geothermal potential spread across the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Malin P.E (2001) Establishment of Geothermal Resource Center to Accelerate the Development of Eastern Africa&lt;/ref&gt; There is enormous potential for geothermal energy in the [[East African Rift]] which is roughly 5,900 kilometers in length and spans several countries in East Africa including [[Eritrea]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Djibouti]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], and [[Zambia]].&lt;ref name="GeoPotEA" /&gt;

===Biomass===
{{See also|Indoor air pollution in developing nations}}
The use of [[biomass]] fuels endangers [[biodiversity]] and risks further damaged or destruction to the landscape. 86% of Africa’s biomass energy is used in the sub-Saharan region, excluding South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Energy in Africa, Chapter 7, United States Energy Information Administration {{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Archives/africa/africa.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616162053/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Archives/africa/africa.html |archivedate=16 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even where other forms of energy are available, it is not harnessed and utilized efficiently, underscoring the need to promote energy efficiency where energy access is available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:A-DQcygwXJ8J:www.nepadst.org/platforms/susenergy.shtml Building a Sustainable Energy Base (NEPAD Platform)]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is, however, an urgent need to address the current levels of respiratory illness from burning biomass in the home. Taking into respect the cost differential between the biomass and fossil fuels, it is far more cost-effective to improve the technology used to burn the biomass than to use fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2005/04.07/11-charcoal.html Benefits of clean fuel in Africa would be enormous], Kevin Myron, Harvard Gazette Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horizontal integration potential===
Solar and wind power are extremely scalable, as there are systems available from less than 1 watt to several megawatts. This makes it possible to initialize the electrification of a home or village with minimal initial capital. It also allows for dynamic and incremental scaling as load demands increases.  The component configuration of a wind or solar installation also provides a level of functional redundancy, improving the reliability of the system. If a single panel in a multi-panel solar array is damaged, the rest of the system continues functioning unimpeded. In a similar way, the failure of a single wind tower in a multi-tower configuration does not cause a system-level failure.

Because solar and wind projects produce power where it is used, they provide a safe, reliable and cost-effective solution. Because transmission equipment is avoided, these systems are more secure, and less vulnerable to attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/45xx/doc4552/09-16-Electricity.pdf Prospects for Distributed Electricity Generation], Congressional Budget Office (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; This can be an important feature in regions prone to conflict. Wind and solar power systems are simple to set up, easy to operate, easy to repair, and durable. Wind resources and solar resource are abundant enough to provide all of the electrical energy requirements of rural populations, and this can be done in remote and otherwise fragmented low-density areas that are impractical to address using conventional grid-based systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etsap.org/worksh_6_2003/2003P_howells.pdf AN ENERGY MODEL FOR A LOW INCOME RURAL AFRICAN VILLAGE], Howells M.I, et al. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finance==
Photo-voltaic panels, wind turbines deep cycle batteries, meters, sockets cables, and connectors are all expensive. Even when the relative difference in buying power, materials cost, opportunity cost, labor cost and overhead is factored in, renewable energy will remain expensive for people who are living on less than US$1 per day. Many rural electrification projects in the past use government subsidies to finance the implementation of rural development programs. It is difficult for rural electrification projects to be accomplished by for-profit companies; in economically impoverished areas these programs must be run at a loss for reasons of practicality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbank.org/afr/findings/english/find177.htm Africa Regional Findings (2001) Rural Electrification: Lessons Learned], ''[[World Bank]]''&lt;/ref&gt; There are several theorized ways in which specific African nations can rally the resources for such projects.

===Potential funding sources===
[[Europe]]an countries that consume oil refined from African countries have the opportunity to subsidize the costs of individual level, village level, or community level alternative energy systems through [[emissions trading]] credits. It has been proposed that for every unit of African origin carbon consumed by the European market, a predetermined amount green credits or carbon credits would be yielded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terradaily.com/reports/Britain_Urges_Global_Carbon_Trading_To_Spur_Eco_Healthy_Growth.html Britain Urges Global Carbon Trading To Spur Eco-Healthy Growth], Aziakou G. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The European partners could then either supply parts, components, or systems directly, an equivalent amount of investment capital, or lend credits to finance the distribution of renewable energy services, knowledge or equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uneptie.org/energy/act/fin/docs/SEF%20Programme%20Update-Jan2006%20_web.pdf Sustainable Energy Finance Activity Overview], UNEP (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

International relief targeted at poverty reduction could also be redirected towards subsidizing renewable energy projects. Because of the integral role that electrification plays in supporting economic and social development, funding of rural electrification can be seen as the core method for addressing poverty. Radios, televisions, telephones, computer networks, and computers all rely on an access to electricity. Because information services allow for the proliferation of education resources, funding the electric backbone to such systems has a derivative effect on their development. In this way, access to communications and education plays a major role in reducing poverty. Additionally, international efforts that supply equipment and services rather than money, are more resistant to resource misappropriation issue that pose problems in less stable governments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-18864338.html Good intentions: the mismanagement of foreign aid], Heckt J.L (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United Nations Environment Programme|UNEP]] has developed a loan programme to stimulate renewable [[energy market]] forces with attractive return rates, buffer initial deployment costs and entice consumers to consider and purchase renewable technology. After a successful [[Indian Solar Loan Programme|solar loan program]] sponsored by UNEP that helped 100,000 people finance solar power systems in developing countries like [[Solar power in India|India]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=504&amp;ArticleID=5562&amp;l=en Solar loan program in India]&lt;/ref&gt;  UNEP started similar schemes in other parts of the developing world like [[Africa]] - [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]], and Kenya projects are already functional and many projects in other African nations are in the pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photon-magazine.com/news/news_02-01_af_kenia_pv_loans.htm Solar loan programme, kenya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715163839/http://www.photon-magazine.com/news/news_02-01_af_kenia_pv_loans.htm |date=15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa, UNEP assistance to Ghana, Kenya, and Namibia has resulted in the adoption of draft National Climate Awareness Plans, publications in local languages, radio programmes and seminars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/themes/climatechange/About/index.asp UNEP on climate change]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rural Energy Enterprise Development (REED) initiative is another flagship UNEP effort focused on enterprise development and seed financing for clean energy entrepreneurs in developing countries of West and Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sefi.unep.org/english/activities/partnerships.html UNEP REED fund] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807054644/http://sefi.unep.org/english/activities/partnerships.html |date=7 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of South Africa]] has set up the South African Renewables Initiative (SARi)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sari.org.za South African Renewables Initiative] www.sari.org.za&lt;/ref&gt; to develop a financing arrangement that would enable a critical mass of renewables to be developed in South Africa, through a combination of international loans and grants, as well as domestic funding. This has been a highly successful programme now known as the REIPPP (Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Programme) with four rounds of allocations already completed. In Round 1, 19 projects were allocated, in Round 2, 28 projects were allocated, in Round 3, 17 projects were allocated and in Round 4, 26 projects were allocated. Over 6100MW has been allocated with a total of R194 billion (US$16 billion) being invested in this programme. It is important to note that this investment figure represents full funding from private entities and banks - there are no government subsidies for this programme.

===Energy sector regulators as facilitators===
The funding of renewable energy (RE) projects is dependent on the credibility of the institutions developing and implementing RE policy. This places a particular burden on the energy regulators in Africa, whose professional staff may be few in number and who have track records of only a decade or so. Rules (micro policies) made by regulators are subsidiary to overall government RE policy and depend on some delegation of authority from the state. Nevertheless, there are instances when the sector regulator can pro-active on behalf of customer and utility concerns—providing facts, reports, and public statements that build a case for care in the design of public policy towards RE. Clean and renewable energy is likely to be of concern to a number of organizations. Interaction between multiple authorities requires coordination to align policies, incentives, and administrative processes (including licensing and permitting). Of course, the making of policy by regulators is incidental to and inherent in their duty to decide specific cases or disputes. This micro policy-making role is derived from the fact that macro RE policy cannot reasonably be expected to anticipate all aspects of policy that will have to evolve for the regulatory process to be fully functional. This point is particularly important in the area of renewable energy, with its rapidly changing technologies and ever-changing public (and political) attitudes. Gaps will have to be filled and it is the regulators, with their functional responsibilities, technical expertise, and hands-on experience that are best positioned to accomplish that task in developing countries. Thus, for designing auctions for purchasing power, for establishing feed-in tariffs, or other instruments promoting RE, the energy sector regulator has a significant impact on the penetration of RE in Africa and other regions.&lt;ref name=PURC&gt;Frequently Asked Questions on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure Regulation, [http://regulationbodyofknowledge.org/renewable-energy-and-energy-efficiency/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewable energy use==

===Solar power===
[[File:SolarGIS-Solar-map-Africa-and-Middle-East-en.png|thumb|Solar radiation map of Africa]]
{{See also|Solar power in Africa}}
Several large-scale solar power facilities are under development in Africa including projects in [[South Africa]] and [[Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;Nji, Renatus. 2006. What alternatives to oil in Africa? ''Africa Renewal.'' Vol.20. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Although solar power technology has the potential to supply energy to large numbers of people, and has been used to generate power on a large scale in developed nations, its greatest potential in Africa may be to provide power on a smaller scale and to use this energy to help with day-to-day needs such as small-scale electrification, [[desalination]], [[water pumping]], and [[water purification]].

The first utility-scale solar farm in Sub-Saharan Africa is the 8.5MW plant at Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village, in the [[Rwamagana District]], Eastern Province of [[Rwanda]]. It leased {{convert|20|hectare|acre}} of land from the village which is a charity to house and educate [[Rwandan genocide]] victims. The plant uses 28,360 [[photovoltaic panel]]s and produces 6% of total electrical supply of the country. The project was built with U.S., Israeli, Dutch, Norwegian, Finnish and UK funding and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/New-Tech/In-Rwanda-Israelis-and-Americans-launch-East-Africas-first-commercial-solar-field-390197 In Rwanda, Israelis and Americans launch East Africa’s first commercial solar field], ''Jeruslaem Post'', February 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Some plans exist to build solar farms in the deserts of North Africa to supply power for Europe. The [[Desertec]] project, backed by several European energy companies and banks, planned to generate renewable electricity in the [[Sahara]] desert and distribute it through a high-voltage grid for export to Europe and local consumption in North-Africa. Ambitions seek to provide continental Europe with up to 15% of its electricity. The [[TuNur project]] would supply 2GW of solar generated electricity from [[Tunisia]] to the UK.

===Solar water pumping===
One of the most immediate and lethal problems facing many third world countries is the availability of clean [[drinking water]]. Solar powered technologies can help alleviate this problem with minimal cost using a combination of solar powered well pumping, a [[water tower]] or other holding tank, and a solar powered water purifier. These technologies require minimal maintenance, have low operational costs, and once set up, will help provide clean water for drinking and agriculture. With large enough [[reservoirs]] for the water that has been pumped and purified with solar powered technology, a community will be better able to withstand drought or famine. This reservoir water could be consumed by humans, livestock, or used to irrigate community gardens and fields, thus improving crop yields and community health. A solar powered water purification system can be used to clean many pathogens and germs from groundwater and [[Surface runoff|runoff]]. A group of these devices, filtering the water from wells or runoff could help with poor sanitation and controlling the spread of [[waterborne illnesses]].

Kenya may be a good candidate for testing out these systems because of its progressive and relatively well-funded department of agriculture, including the Kenya Agricultural Research Center, which provides funding and oversight to many projects investigating experimental methods and technologies.

Even though this solar technology may have a higher starting cost than that of conventional fossil fuel, the low maintenance and operation cost and the ability to operate without fuel makes the solar powered systems cheaper to keep running. A small rural community could use a system like this indefinitely, and it would provide clean drinking water at a negligible cost after the initial equipment purchase and setup. In a larger community, it could at least contribute to the water supply and reduce pressures of daily survival. This technology is capable of pumping hundreds of gallons of water per day, and is limited only by the amount of water available in the water table.

With a minimum of training in operation and maintenance, solar powered water pumping and purification systems have the potential to help rural Africans fulfill one of their most basic needs for survival. Further field test are in progress by organizations like KARI and the many corporations that manufacture the products needed, and these small-scale applications of solar technology are promising. Combined with sustainable agricultural practices and conservation of natural resources, solar power is a prime candidate to bring the benefits of technology to the parched lands of Africa.

Supplementing the well water would be collection of runoff rainwater during the rainy season for later use in drought. Southern Africa has its own network of information sharing called SEARNET, which informs farmers of techniques to [[rainwater harvesting|catch and store rainwater]], with some seeing increased yields and additional harvests.&lt;ref&gt;Moyo, S. and Nyimo, T. 2006. Regional Annex Rainwater Harvesting in Southern Africa. ''The WELL resource centre for water, sanitation and environmental health.''&lt;/ref&gt; This new network of farmers sharing their ideas with each other has led to a spread of both new and old ideas, and this has led to greater sustainability of water resources in the countries of [[Botswana]], Ethiopia, Kenya, [[Malawi]], Rwanda, [[Tanzania]], Uganda, Zambia and [[Zimbabwe]]. This water could be used for agriculture or livestock, or could be fed through a purifier to yield water suitable for human consumption.

====Examples====
A solar powered water pump and holding system was installed in [[Kayrati]], [[Chad]], in 2004 as compensation for land lost to oil development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=51637 CHAD: Trying to make oil wealth work for the people], UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; This system utilizes a standard well pump powered by a photovoltaic panel array. The pumped water is stored in a water tower, providing the pressure needed to deliver water to homes in the area. This use of oil revenue to build infrastructure is an example of using profits to advance the standard of living in rural areas.

Hundreds of solar water pumping stations in Sudan fulfil a similar role, involving various applications of different systems for pumping and storage. Over the past 10 years approximately. 250 [[photovoltaic]] water pumps have been installed in Sudan. Considerable progress has been made and the present generation of systems appear to be reliable and cost–effective under certain conditions. A photovoltaic pumping system to pump 25 cubic metres per day requires a solar array of approx. 800 Wp. Such a pump would cost US$6000, since the total system comprises the cost of modules, pump, motor, pipework, wiring, control system and array support structure. PV water pumping has been promoted successfully in Kordofan state in Sudan. It shows favorable economics as compared to diesel pumps, and is free from the need to maintain a regular supply of fuel. The only maintenance problems with PV pumping [are] due to the breakdown of pumps and not the failure of the PV devices.&lt;ref&gt;Omer, Abdeen Mustafa. 2000. Solar water pumping clean water for Sudan rural areas. ''Renewable Energy'' Vol. 24. (pp.245–258)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Solar Water Purifier, developed and manufactured by an Australian company, is a low-maintenance, low operational cost solution that is able to purify large amounts of water, even seawater, to levels better than human consumption standards set by the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarwaterpurifier.com/html/howworks.htm How SWP Works], Solar Water Purifier website, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This device works through the processes of [[evaporation]] and [[UV radiation]]. Light passes through the top layer of glass to the black plastic layer underneath. Heat from the solar radiation is trapped by the water and by the black plastic. This plastic layer is a series of connected troughs that separate the water as it evaporates and trickles down through the levels. The water is also subjected to UV radiation for an extended period of time as it moves through the device, which kills many bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. In a sunny, equatorial area like much of Africa, this device is capable of purifying up to 45 litres per day from a single array. Additional arrays may be chained together for more capacity.

The Water School uses SODIS solar disinfection currently in target areas of Kenya and Uganda to help people drink water free of pathogens and disease causing bacteria. SODIS is a UV process that kills microorganisms in the water to prevent water borne disease. The science of the SODIS system is proven with over 20 years of research.

===Wind power===
[[File:Darling Wind Farm.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Darling Wind Farm]] in South Africa]]
{{See also|Wind power in Kenya|Wind power in Morocco}}
The [[Koudia Al Baida Farm]] in Morocco, is the largest wind farm in the continent. Two other large wind farms are under construction in [[Tangier]] and [[Tarfaya]]. 

Kenya is building a wind farm, the [[Lake Turkana Wind Power (LTWP)]], in [[Marsabit County]]. As Africa’s largest wind farm, the project will increase the national electricity supply while creating jobs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. LTWP is planned to produce 310 MW of wind power at full capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-benefits-leds/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in practice: Massive wind power project to benefit Kenya|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="LTWPKenya"&gt;[http://laketurkanawindpower.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2009, the first [[wind turbine]] in West Africa was erected in [[Batokunku]], a village in [[The Gambia]]. The 150 kilowatt turbine provides electrical power for the 2,000-person village.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| author =Dierk Jensen | title =A Second Life in Africa | publisher =New Energy Magazine |date = March 2009| url = http://indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/content/333498/a-second-life-in-africa/| accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South African REIPPP has resulted in several wind farms already in commercial operation in the country. These wind farms are currently in operation in the provinces of the Eastern, Northern and Western Cape. It is estimated that 10 farms are already under construction or in operation, with 12 more being approved with the 4th Round of the REIPPP.

===Geothermal power===
{{See also|Geothermal power|Geothermal power in Kenya}}
So far, only Kenya has exploited the geothermal potential of the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]].&lt;ref name="GeoPotEA" /&gt; Kenya has been estimated to contain 10,000 MWe of potential geothermal energy,&lt;ref&gt;http://en.ccchina.gov.cn/Detail.aspx?newsId=38323&amp;TId=97&lt;/ref&gt; and has twenty potential drilling sites marked for survey in addition to three operational geothermal plants.&lt;ref name="IGA1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iga.igg.cnr.it/geoworld/geoworld.php?sub=map&amp;country=kenya |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210032039/http://iga.igg.cnr.it/geoworld/geoworld.php?sub=map&amp;country=kenya |archivedate=10 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}, International Geothermal Association&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya was the first country in Africa to adopt geothermal energy, in 1956, and houses the largest geothermal power plant on the continent, [[Olkaria_II_Geothermal_Power_Station|Olkaria II]], operated by Kengen, who also operate [[Olkaria_I_Geothermal_Power_Station|Olkaria I]]. A further plant, [[Olkaria_III_Geothermal_Power_Station|Olkaria III]], is privately owned and operated.&lt;ref name="IGA1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GeoPotKenya"&gt;[http://ttclear.unfccc.int/ttclear/presentations/Kenya/geo.pdf Geothermal Potential in Kenya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612100636/http://ttclear.unfccc.int/ttclear/presentations/Kenya/geo.pdf |date=12 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethiopia is home to a single binary-cycle plant but does not utilize its full potential energy output for lack of experience in its operation.&lt;ref name="GeoPotEA" /&gt; Zambia has several sites planned for construction but their projects have stalled due to lack of funds.&lt;ref name="GeoPotEA" /&gt; Eritrea, Djibouti and Uganda have undertaken preliminary exploration for potential geothermal sources but have not constructed any type of power plant.&lt;ref name="GeoPotEA" /&gt;

Geothermal power has been used in agricultural projects in Africa. The [[Oserian]] flower farm in Kenya utilizes several steam wells abandoned by Kengen to power its greenhouse.  In addition, the heat involved in the geothermal process is used to maintain stable greenhouse temperatures.  The heat can also be utilized in cooking, which would help eliminate the dependence on wood burning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4473111.stm Kenya Looks Underground for Power], ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finance====
Exploration and construction of future geothermal plants present a high cost for poor countries.&lt;ref name="Geothermal Energy"&gt;[http://www.solarnavigator.net/geothermal_energy.htm Geothermal Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;  Drilling potential sites alone costs millions of dollars and can result in zero energy return if the consistency of the heat and steam is unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4473111.stm Kenya Looks Underground for Power]&lt;/ref&gt;  Return on investments into geothermal power are not as quick as those into fossil fuels and may take years to pay off; however, low-maintenance cost and the renewable nature of geothermal energy mean more benefits in the long term.&lt;ref name="Geothermal Energy"/&gt;

As an early and successful adopter of geothermal power, Kenya now has significant financial backing from the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name="GeoPotKenya" /&gt; The country hosts development conferences between representatives of the UN Environment Program and various African governments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2287">In [[particle physics]], a '''resonance''' is the peak located around a certain energy found in [[differential cross section]]s of [[scattering|scattering experiments]]. These peaks are associated with [[subatomic particle]]s, which include a variety of [[boson]]s, [[quark]]s and [[hadron]]s (such as [[nucleon]]s, [[delta baryon]]s or [[upsilon meson]]s) and their [[excited state|excitations]]. In common usage, "resonance" only describes particles with very short [[mean lifetime|lifetime]]s, mostly high-energy hadrons existing for {{val||e=-23|u=[[second]]s}} or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phy.duke.edu/~kolena/modern/dudley.html|title=What is a Resonance Particle?|last1=Dudley|first1=Chris|access-date=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[resonance width|width of the resonance]] (''&amp;Gamma;'') is related to the [[mean lifetime]] (''&amp;tau;'') of the particle (or its excited state) by the relation

:&lt;Math&gt;\Gamma=\frac{\hbar}{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]] and &lt;Math&gt;{\hbar}=\frac{h}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, the lifetime of a particle is the direct [[multiplicative inverse|inverse]] of the particle's resonance width. For example, the charged [[pion]] has the second-longest lifetime of any meson, at {{val|2.6033|e=-8|u=[[second|s]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;K.A. Olive ''et al''. (Particle Data Group) (2016): [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2016/listings/rpp2016-list-pi-plus-minus.pdf Particle listings – {{Subatomic particle|Pion+-}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, its resonance width is very small, about {{val|2.528|e=-8|u=[[electronvolt|eV]]}} or about 6.11 [[megahertz|MHz]]. Pions are generally not considered as "resonances". The charged [[rho meson]] has a very short lifetime, about {{val|4.41|e=-24|u=s}}. Correspondingly, its resonance width is very large, at 149.1 [[megaelectronvolt|MeV]] or about 36 [[zettahertz|ZHz]]. This amounts to nearly one-fifth of the particle's [[rest mass]].&lt;ref&gt;K.A. Olive ''et al''. (Particle Data Group) (2016): [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2016/listings/rpp2016-list-rho-770.pdf Particle listings – {{Subatomic particle|rho}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Revillagigedo Islands''' ({{lang-es|Islas Revillagigedo}}, {{IPA-es|reˈβiʝa xiˈxeðo|IPA}}) or '''Revillagigedo Archipelago''' are a group of four [[volcanic]] [[island]]s in the [[Pacific Ocean]], known for their unique ecosystem. They lie approximately {{convert|240|mi|km|order=flip}} southwest of [[Cabo San Lucas]], the southern tip of the [[Baja California Peninsula]], and {{convert|720|to|970|km|mi}} west of [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]]. They are located around {{coord|18|49|N|112|46|W}}{{coord|18|49|N|112|46|W|display=title}}. Technically part of the Mexican state of [[Colima]], the islands are under Mexican federal jurisdiction.

In July 2016, the Revillagigedo Archipelago were inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archipiélago de Revillagigedo|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1510/|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|accessdate=19 July 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in November 2017 they were declared to be a [[marine reserve]] and a [[List of national parks of Mexico|national park of Mexico]].&lt;ref name="MPA"/&gt;

The total area is 157.81&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (60.93&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), spread over an east-to-west extent of about 420&amp;nbsp;km (261&amp;nbsp;mi). A naval station in the south of [[Socorro Island]] has a population of 45 (staff). On [[Clarion Island|Clarión]] is a small naval garrison with 9 men. The islands are otherwise uninhabited. The islands are named after [[Don (honorific)|Don]] [[Juan Vicente de Güemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo]], the 53rd viceroy of [[New Spain]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The three eastern islands are called the inner islands. They fall in the [[time zone]] [[UTC-7]] ([[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain Time]]), while the major part of [[Colima]] is [[UTC-6]] ([[Central Time Zone]]). Clarión is comparatively far to the west, by more than 200&amp;nbsp;km in comparison with the inner islands, and in [[UTC-8]] ([[Pacific Time Zone]]). The Revillagigedo Islands are one of three Mexican island groups in the Pacific Ocean that are not on the [[continental shelf]]; the others are [[Guadalupe Island]] and [[Rocas Alijos]].

==History==

===Sixteenth to nineteenth century===
[[File:Localisation de l'ile de Clipperton.png|thumbnail|Location of [[Socorro Island]] and the rest of the Revillagigedo Archipelago, and extent of Mexico's western [[EEZ]] in the Pacific]]
No evidence of human habitation on Socorro exists before its discovery by Spanish explorers. [[Hernando de Grijalva]] and his crew discovered an uninhabited island on 19 December 1533, and named it ''Santo Tomás'' ([[Socorro Island]]) and on 28 December they discovered ''Isla de los Inocentes'' ([[San Benedicto Island|San Benedicto]]) which owed its name to having been found on the day of the [[Massacre of the Innocents|Holy Innocents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brand|first1=Donald D.|editor1-last=Friis|editor1-first=Herman R.|title=The Pacific Basin. A History of its Geographical Exploration|date=1967|publisher=American Geographical Society|location=New York|page=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Geographical Society of New York (1967), [https://books.google.com/books?id=eUcsAAAAMAAJ Special publication], issue 38, p. 370, [[American Geographical Society]], ISSN 0065-843X&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1542, [[Ruy López de Villalobos]], while exploring new routes across the Pacific, rediscovered ''Inocentes'' and ''Santo Tomás'' and charted the latter as ''Anublada'' ("Cloudy"). Villalobos was the first to report sighting of [[Roca Partida|Roca Partida Island]] giving it its present-day name. In 1608, Martín Yánez de Armida, in charge of another expedition, visited ''Anublada'' and changed its name to [[Our Lady of Perpetual Help|Socorro]]. In 1779 José Camacho was the first to report sighting of the island remaining, that he charted as ''Santa Rosa'' ("Saint Rose"). ''Santa Rosa'' was later renamed ''Clarion'' after the vessel commanded by Henry Gyzelaar at that time.

The Revillagigedo Islands have been visited by a number of other explorers: [[Domingo del Castillo]] (1541), [[Miguel Pinto (explorer)|Miguel Pinto]] (1772), [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1811), [[Benjamin Morrell]] (1825), Sir [[Edward Belcher]] (1839) who made the first botanical collections and Reeve, who witnessed the eruption of Mount Evermann in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Geological Survey (U.S.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=DE_wAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA281 ''U.S. Geological Survey professional paper''], issue 492–493, p. 281, ISSN 1044-9620&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 July 1861, [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Benito Juárez]] signed a decree awarding territorial control over the four islands to the state of [[Colima]]. His plan was to build an offshore penitentiary on Isla Socorro; although this never happened, the decree whereby they were attached to Colima has never been repealed. In 1865, the island was explored by ornithologist [[Andrew Jackson Grayson]], who discovered the [[Socorro dove]], [[Socorro mockingbird]] and the [[Socorro elf owl]] which were later given [[scientific name]]s in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.abcbirds.org/birdconservationalliance/join/mag_sample.pdf| title=ABC Report| work=Socorro Island:Fire and Brimstone in the Mexican Pacific| author=Mike Parr| accessdate=20 March 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719014851/http://www.abcbirds.org/birdconservationalliance/join/mag_sample.pdf| archivedate=19 July 2011| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century===
[[File:Map mexico volcanoes.gif|thumb|right|220px|Socorro and Bárcena on San Benedicto are indicated on this map of Mexican volcanoes]]
At the beginning of the twentieth century, Dr. [[Barton Warren Evermann]], director of the [[California Academy of Sciences]] in [[San Francisco, California]], promoted the scientific exploration of the islands. The most comprehensive biological collections were obtained at this time. The volcano on Isla Socorro was renamed in his honor. In 1957 the Mexican Navy established a naval base on Socorro and has had a permanent presence on the island since then.  A tiny outpost also exists on Clarión, as noted above. On  21 March 1972, [[Pablo Silva García]] became the first [[Governor of Colima]] to visit his state's island territories. A plaque was unveiled to mark the event and cement Colima's claim.

The seas surrounding the larger islands are popular with [[Scuba diving|scuba divers]]; a variety of marine life such as [[cetacean]]s, [[shark]]s and [[manta ray]]s can be observed. Visitors usually stay aboard expedition vessels during their visit to the islands, which is desirable from an ecological standpoint to prevent introduction of further [[invasive species]].

The islands are occasionally visited by [[amateur radio]] operators, who usually use the [[ITU prefix]] XF4.  Because of their distance from the mainland, for award credit they are considered to be an "entity" separate from Mexico. Expeditions from organizations engaged in [[conservation biology|biological conservation]] of the islands visit the islands for fieldwork on a regular basis. No [[tourism]] facilities exist; the islands have no reliable sources of fresh water of their own.&lt;ref name = b&amp;h1953/&gt;

===Twenty-first century===
On 24 November 2017, [[President of Mexico]] [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] created North America's largest marine protected area around the Revillagigedo Islands. This protected area covers 57,000 square miles or 150,000 square kilometers around the islands, and bans fishing, mining, and tourism development in the protected area and on the islands.&lt;ref name="MPA"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Busby|first1=Mattha|title=Mexico creates vast new ocean reserve to protect 'Galapagos of North America'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/25/mexico-creates-vast-new-ocean-reserve-to-protect-galapagos-of-north-america?CMP=fb_gu|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=The Guardian|date=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
The Revillagigedo Islands are home to many [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] plant and animal species, and are sometimes called Mexico's "little [[Galápagos Islands|Galápagos]]". They are recognized as a distinct [[terrestrial ecoregion]], part of the [[Neotropic]] [[ecozone]]. Socorro is the most diverse in flora, fauna, and topography. The Mexican Government established the islands as a [[Biosphere Reserve]] on June 4, 1994.

According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF),&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=nt0216|name=Islas Revillagigedo dry forests}}&lt;/ref&gt; 14 of the islands' 16 generally accepted resident [[taxa]] of landbirds&lt;ref&gt;Including one waterbird, the local [[yellow-crowned night heron]] [[subspecies]].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as one [[seabird]] are endemic, as are all of the islands' native terrestrial vertebrates. The latter, however, consist only of a whip snake (''[[Masticophis]] anthonyi''), a night snake (''[[Hypsiglena unaocularis]]'') and two ''[[Urosaurus]]'' [[iguanid]]s (''U. auriculatus'' and ''U. clarionensis''). Numerous [[seabird]] taxa breed no further north(east)wards than San Benedicto; [[storm-petrel]]s are notably absent as breeders though they breed in the region and visit the islands to forage. [[Albatross]]es are also not normally found here. Among landbirds, the absence of the [[house finch]], widespread on northeastern Pacific offshore islands, is the most conspicuous one.&lt;ref name = b&amp;h1953 /&gt;&lt;!-- this should be made into a "B&amp;H (1953), WWF (???)" ref - it sources everything but the 2 nonnnative landbirds --&gt;

Apart from the native birds, [[bird migration|migrant]] [[shorebird]]s and others are often found on the islands. ''Bahia Azufre'' (Sulfur Bay) on Clarión seems to be a favorite stopover location, as it is one of the few longer stretches of beach in the islands; mostly, the shoreline is steep cliffs.&lt;ref name = b&amp;h1953 /&gt; The archipelago is also a part of wintering grounds for [[humpback whale]]s in north pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Urban J., Jaramillo A.L., Aguayo A., Baker S.C., 2000, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284931167_Migratory_destinations_of_humpback_whales_wintering_in_the_Mexican_Pacific Migratory destinations of humpback whales wintering in the Mexican Pacific], Journal of Cetacean Research and Management 2(2), pp.101–110, Retrieved on January 29, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Socorro has numerous endemic plant taxa, whereas Clarión which is farthest from land has but a few. The San Benedicto ecosystem was nearly wiped out in the devastating eruption of Bárcena volcano on August 1, 1952, but has since recovered; apparently just the [[San Benedicto rock wren]] became entirely extinct.&lt;ref name = b&amp;h1953 /&gt; Most if not all native plants found on San Benedicto today are shared with Clarión, not with the closer Socorro to the south, due to the prevailing winds and [[ocean current]]s. The native flora of Clarión is about equally shared with both other large islands.&lt;ref name=CMICD/&gt;

As opposed to the interchange between the islands, the animals and plants that colonized them initially are apparently all from mainland populations generally to the northeastward of the Revillagigedos. Plants are most often derived from [[Baja California]] founder populations, whereas the endemic nonavian [[reptile]]s seem to be rather derived directly from mainland populations of the [[Sonora]]-[[Sinaloa]] area. The ancestors of the islands' terrestrial birds probably came from the general area of southern [[North America|North]] and northern [[Central America]]. As illustrated by the fact that no endemic landbird taxon occurs on more than one island and the cases of the [[Socorro wren|Socorro]] and [[Clarión wren]]s as well as the [[Socorro dove]] and Clarión [[mourning dove]], each bird population seems to have arisen independently.&lt;ref name = b&amp;h1953 /&gt;

===Threats and conservation===
[[File:Zenaida graysoni.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Socorro dove]] (''Zenaida graysoni'') survives only in captivity at present]]
As late as 1956 it was said that
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The future of the avifauna of the islands appears to be secure at present. There are no human inhabitants, and no mammals of any kind except the moderate and apparently stable population of sheep on Socorro."&lt;ref name = b&amp;h1953 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The unique ecology of the islands has since then come under threat from these and other exotic species. Sheep were introduced to Socorro in 1869, and cats have become established after 1953, probably in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name = b&amp;h1953/&gt;&lt;ref name = BLI/&gt; Pigs were introduced to Clarión in 1979, and rabbits became [[feral]] at some earlier date.&lt;ref name=iucn2007/&gt;

Several endemic species of Socorro are now threatened with extinction. The [[Socorro mockingbird]] (''Mimodes graysoni'') numbers less than 400 individuals altogether. The endemic [[Socorro parakeet]] (''Aratinga brevipes'') and [[Townsend's shearwater]] (''Puffinus auricularis''), are also endangered. The [[Socorro dove]] (''Zenaida graysoni'') is now extinct in the wild, but is being bred in captivity. The [[elf owl]]'s Socorro [[subspecies]] ''Micrathene whitneyi graysoni'' appears to be [[extinct]].&lt;ref&gt;Weick, Friedhelm (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PLhOcUhUR20C&amp;pg=PA187 ''Owls (Strigiformes): annotated and illustrated checklist''], Springer, p. 187, {{ISBN|3-540-35234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other plant and animal taxa in the archipelago are also considered threatened or nearly so.&lt;ref name=iucn2007 /&gt;

A number of [[habitat conservation|conservation]] initiatives are dedicated to halting the destruction of the native ecosystems of the islands. Dr. Harmunt Walter of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) and Dr. [[Luis Baptista|Luis F. Baptista]] of the [[California Academy of Sciences]] have coordinated breeding and reintroduction efforts for the Socorro dove since 1988, through the Island Endemics Institute. The ''Comité Científico para la Conservación y Restauración del Archipiélago Revillagigedo'' ("Scientific Committee for the Conservation and Restoration of the Revillagigedo Islands") was founded in 1996, and is a committee representing several organizations, including the Island Conservation &amp; Ecology Group, Island Endemics Institute, the [[University of Missouri–St. Louis]] (UMSL), the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM) and others. It is chaired by Dr. Walter and Dr. Luis Medrano of UNAM is its secretary. The committee has been advocating removal of the exotic species from the islands, especially the estimated 2000 sheep on Socorro, to allow the islands' ecology to recover, and adoption of a management plan to promote the recovery of the islands' native species, including reintroduction of the Socorro dove.

Brattstrom and Howell who gave the optimistic outlook in 1956 went on to caution that
&lt;blockquote&gt;"it may be hoped that the Mexican government will guard against the introduction of mammals such as rabbits, cats, goats and others that have invariably brought disaster to the flora and fauna of insular regions."&lt;ref name = b&amp;h1953 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 25 November 2017, [[President of Mexico]] [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] acted to protect the biodiversity of the region by creating North America's largest marine protected area around the islands, and prohibiting mining, fishing, and tourism development on or near the islands.&lt;ref name="MPA"/&gt;

Later the concept was expanded greatly to include any interaction with radiative energy as a function of its wavelength or [[frequency]]. Spectroscopic data are often represented by an [[emission spectrum]], a plot of the response of interest as a function of wavelength or frequency.

== Introduction ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Spectroscopy and spectrography are terms used to refer to the measurement of radiation intensity as a function of wavelength and are often used to describe [[experimental]] spectroscopic methods. Spectral measurement devices are referred to as [[spectrometers]], [[spectrophotometers]], [[spectrograph]]s or [[spectral analyzer]]s.

Daily observations of [[color]] can be related to spectroscopy. [[Neon lighting]] is a direct application of [[atomic spectroscopy]]. Neon and other [[noble gases]] have characteristic emission frequencies (colors). Neon lamps use collision of electrons with the gas to excite these emissions. [[Inks]], [[dyes]] and [[paints]] include chemical compounds selected for their spectral characteristics in order to generate specific colors and hues. A commonly encountered [[Emission spectrum|molecular spectrum]] is that of [[nitrogen dioxide]]. Gaseous nitrogen dioxide has a characteristic red absorption feature, and this gives air polluted with nitrogen dioxide a reddish-brown color. [[Rayleigh scattering]] is a spectroscopic scattering phenomenon that accounts for the color of the sky.

Spectroscopic studies were central to the development of [[quantum mechanics]] and included [[Max Planck]]'s explanation of [[blackbody radiation]], [[Albert Einstein]]'s explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] and [[Niels Bohr]]'s explanation of [[atomic structure]] and spectra. Spectroscopy is used in [[physical chemistry|physical]] and [[analytical chemistry]] because [[atoms]] and [[molecules]] have unique spectra. As a result, these spectra can be used to detect, identify and quantify information about the atoms and molecules. Spectroscopy is also used in [[astronomical spectroscopy|astronomy]] and [[remote sensing]] on Earth. Most research [[telescopes]] have spectrographs. The measured spectra are used to determine the chemical composition and [[physical property|physical properties]] of [[astronomical objects]] (such as their [[temperature]] and [[velocity]]).

== Theory ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
One of the central concepts in spectroscopy is a [[resonance]] and its corresponding resonant frequency. Resonances were first characterized in mechanical systems such as [[pendulums]]. Mechanical systems that vibrate or oscillate will experience large amplitude oscillations when they are driven at their resonant frequency. A plot of amplitude vs. excitation frequency will have a peak centered at the resonance frequency. This plot is one type of spectrum, with the peak often referred to as a [[spectral line]], and most spectral lines have a similar appearance.

In quantum mechanical systems, the analogous resonance is a coupling of two quantum mechanical [[stationary state]]s of one system, such as an [[atom]], via an oscillatory source of energy such as a [[photon]]. The coupling of the two states is strongest when the energy of the source matches the energy difference between the two states. The energy &lt;math&gt;(E)&lt;/math&gt; of a photon is related to its frequency &lt;math&gt;(\nu)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;E = h\nu&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]], and so a spectrum of the system response vs. photon frequency will peak at the resonant frequency or energy. Particles such as [[electron]]s and [[neutron]]s have a comparable relationship, the [[de Broglie relations]], between their kinetic energy and their wavelength and frequency and therefore can also excite resonant interactions.

Spectra of atoms and molecules often consist of a series of spectral lines, each one representing a resonance between two different quantum states. The explanation of these series, and the spectral patterns associated with them, were one of the experimental enigmas that drove the development and acceptance of quantum mechanics. The [[hydrogen spectral series]] in particular was first successfully explained by the [[Bohr model|Rutherford-Bohr quantum model]] of the hydrogen atom. In some cases spectral lines are well separated and distinguishable, but spectral lines can also overlap and appear to be a single transition if the [[density of states|density of energy states]] is high enough. Named series of lines include the [[principal series|principal]], [[sharp series|sharp]], [[diffuse series|diffuse]] and [[fundamental series]].

== Classification of methods ==
[[File:A Taste of ESPRESSO.jpg|thumb|A huge diffraction grating at the heart of the ultra-precise [[ESPRESSO]] spectrograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Taste of ESPRESSO|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1537a/|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Spectroscopy is a sufficiently broad field that many sub-disciplines exist, each with numerous implementations of specific spectroscopic techniques. The various implementations and techniques can be classified in several ways.

===Type of radiative energy===
{{unsourced|section|date=June 2018}}
The types of spectroscopy are distinguished by the type of radiative energy involved in the interaction. In many applications, the spectrum is determined by measuring changes in the intensity or frequency of this energy. The types of radiative energy studied include:
* [[Electromagnetic radiation]] was the first source of energy used for spectroscopic studies. Techniques that employ electromagnetic radiation are typically classified by the wavelength region of the spectrum and include [[microwave spectroscopy|microwave]], [[terahertz spectroscopy and technology|terahertz]], [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared]], [[near-infrared spectroscopy|near-infrared]], [[Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy|ultraviolet-visible]], [[x-ray spectroscopy|x-ray]], and [[gamma spectroscopy|gamma]] spectroscopy.
* Particles, because of their [[Matter wave|de Broglie waves]], can also be a source of radiative energy. Both [[electron spectroscopy|electron]] and [[neutron spectroscopy|neutron]] spectroscopy are commonly used. For a particle, its [[kinetic energy]] determines its wavelength.
* [[Spectrogram|Acoustic spectroscopy]] involves radiated pressure waves.
* [[Dynamic mechanical analysis]] can be employed to impart radiating energy, similar to acoustic waves, to solid materials.

===Nature of the interaction===
The types of spectroscopy also can be distinguished by the nature of the interaction between the energy and the material. These interactions include:&lt;ref name="em-spec"&gt;{{cite book | author=Crouch, Stanley | author2=Skoog, Douglas A. | title=Principles of instrumental analysis | publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole | location=Australia | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-495-01201-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Absorption spectroscopy]]: Absorption occurs when energy from the radiative source is absorbed by the material. Absorption is often determined by measuring the fraction of energy transmitted through the material, with absorption decreasing the transmitted portion.
* [[Emission spectroscopy]]: Emission indicates that radiative energy is released by the material. A material's [[blackbody spectrum]] is a spontaneous emission spectrum determined by its temperature. This feature can be measured in the infrared by instruments such as the atmospheric emitted radiance interferometer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mariani | first1=Z. | last2=Strong | first2=K. | last3=Wolff | first3=M. | last4=Rowe | first4=P. | year=2012 | title=Infrared measurements in the Arctic using two Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometers | journal=Atmos.

A. | bibcode=2012AMT.....5..329M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emission can also be induced by other sources of energy such as [[flame spectroscopy|flames]] or sparks or electromagnetic radiation in the case of [[fluorescence spectroscopy|fluorescence]].
* [[Elastic scattering]] and [[reflectivity|reflection]] spectroscopy determine how incident radiation is reflected or scattered by a material. [[Crystallography]] employs the scattering of high energy radiation, such as x-rays and electrons, to examine the arrangement of atoms in proteins and solid crystals.
* [[Impedance spectroscopy]]: Impedance is the ability of a medium to impede or slow the transmittance of energy. For [[optics|optical]] applications, this is characterized by the [[index of refraction]].
* [[Inelastic scattering]] phenomena involve an exchange of energy between the radiation and the matter that shifts the wavelength of the scattered radiation. These include [[Raman scattering|Raman]] and [[Compton scattering|Compton]] scattering.
* [[Coherent spectroscopy|Coherent]] or resonance spectroscopy are techniques where the radiative energy couples two quantum states of the material in a [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] interaction that is sustained by the radiating field. The coherence can be disrupted by other interactions, such as particle collisions and energy transfer, and so often require high intensity radiation to be sustained. [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy]] is a widely used resonance method, and [[ultrafast laser spectroscopy]] is also possible in the infrared and visible spectral regions.

===Type of material===
{{unsourced|section|date=June 2018}}
Spectroscopic studies are designed so that the radiant energy interacts with specific types of matter.

====Atoms====
[[Atomic spectroscopy]] was the first application of spectroscopy developed. [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy]] and [[atomic emission spectroscopy]] involve visible and ultraviolet light. These absorptions and emissions, often referred to as atomic spectral lines, are due to [[Atomic structure#Energy levels|electronic transitions]] of outer shell electrons as they rise and fall from one electron orbit to another. Atoms also have distinct x-ray spectra that are attributable to the excitation of inner shell electrons to excited states.

Atoms of different elements have distinct spectra and therefore atomic spectroscopy allows for the identification and quantitation of a sample's elemental composition. [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] discovered new elements by observing their emission spectra. Atomic absorption lines are observed in the solar spectrum and referred to as [[Fraunhofer lines]] after their discoverer. A comprehensive explanation of the [[Hydrogen spectral series|hydrogen spectrum]] was an early success of quantum mechanics and explained the [[Lamb shift]] observed in the hydrogen spectrum, which further led to the development of [[quantum electrodynamics]].

Modern implementations of atomic spectroscopy for studying visible and ultraviolet transitions include [[flame emission spectroscopy]], [[inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy]], [[Glow discharge#Use in analytical chemistry|glow discharge spectroscopy]], [[microwave induced plasma]] spectroscopy, and spark or arc emission spectroscopy. Techniques for studying x-ray spectra include [[X-ray spectroscopy]] and [[X-ray fluorescence]].

====Molecules====
The combination of atoms into molecules leads to the creation of unique types of energetic states and therefore unique spectra of the transitions between these states. Molecular spectra can be obtained due to electron spin states ([[electron paramagnetic resonance]]), [[rotational spectroscopy|molecular rotations]], [[molecular vibration]], and electronic states. Rotations are collective motions of the atomic nuclei and typically lead to spectra in the microwave and millimeter-wave spectral regions. Rotational spectroscopy and microwave spectroscopy are synonymous. Vibrations are relative motions of the atomic nuclei and are studied by both infrared and [[Raman spectroscopy]]. Electronic excitations are studied using visible and ultraviolet spectroscopy as well as [[fluorescence spectroscopy]].

Studies in molecular spectroscopy led to the development of the first [[maser]] and contributed to the subsequent development of the [[laser]].

====Crystals and extended materials====
The combination of atoms or molecules into crystals or other extended forms leads to the creation of additional energetic states. These states are numerous and therefore have a high density of states. This high density often makes the spectra weaker and less distinct, i.e., broader. For instance, blackbody radiation is due to the thermal motions of atoms and molecules within a material. Acoustic and mechanical responses are due to collective motions as well.
Pure crystals, though, can have distinct spectral transitions, and the crystal arrangement also has an effect on the observed molecular spectra. The regular [[lattice structure]] of crystals also scatters x-rays, electrons or neutrons allowing for crystallographic studies.

====Nuclei====
Nuclei also have distinct energy states that are widely separated and lead to [[gamma ray]] spectra. Distinct nuclear spin states can have their energy separated by a magnetic field, and this allows for [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]].

==Other types==

==History==
{{Main|History of spectroscopy}}

The history of spectroscopy began with [[Isaac Newton]]'s optics experiments (1666–1672). Newton applied the word "spectrum" to describe the rainbow of colors that combine to form white light and that are revealed when the white light is passed through a prism. During the early 1800s, [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] made experimental advances with dispersive spectrometers that enabled spectroscopy to become a more precise and quantitative scientific technique. Since then, spectroscopy has played and continues to play a significant role in chemistry, physics, and astronomy.

* "In 1672, in the first paper that he submitted to the [[Royal Society]], Isaac Newton described an experiment in which he permitted sunlight to pass through a small hole and then through a prism. Newton found that sunlight, which looks white to us, is actually made up of a mixture of all the colors of the rainbow."&lt;ref name="open-astro"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cnx.org/content/col11992/latest/ | title=OpenStax Astronomy | author1=[[Andrew Fraknoi]] | author2=[[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] | date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "In 1802, [[William Hyde Wollaston]] built an improved spectrometer that included a lens to focus the Sun’s spectrum on a screen. Upon use, Wollaston realized that the colors were not spread uniformly, but instead had missing patches of colors, which appeared as dark bands in the [[spectrum]].  Later, in 1815, German physicist [[Joseph Fraunhofer]] also examined the solar spectrum, and found about 600 such dark lines (missing colors), which are now known as [[Fraunhofer lines]], or [[Absorption lines]]."&lt;ref name="open-astro"/&gt;

'''''Tianxia'''''  ({{zh|c=[[wikt:天下|天下]]}}) or '''''All under Heaven''''' is a [[Chinese language|Chinese]] term for an ancient [[Culture of China|Chinese cultural]] concept that denoted either the entire geographical world or the metaphysical realm of mortals, and later became associated with political sovereignty. In [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], ''tianxia'' denoted the lands, space, and area divinely appointed to the Emperor by universal and well-defined principles of order.  The center of this land was directly apportioned to the Imperial court, forming the center of a world view that centered on the Imperial court and went concentrically outward to major and minor officials and then the common citizens, [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|tributary states]], and finally ending with the fringe "[[barbarians]]".  

The center of this world view was not exclusionary in nature, and outer groups, such as ethnic minorities and foreign people, who accepted the mandate of the Chinese Emperor were themselves received and included into the Chinese ''tianxia''. However, as the concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] in this context was a narrative device facilitating transitions between various ethnic Chinese political dynasties (with notable exceptions) this essentially made such people second-class citizens subservient to an ethno-Chinese polity. In classical Chinese political thought, the "Son of Heaven" ([[Emperor of China]]) ({{zh|c=天子|p=tiānzǐ|w = t'ien&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-tzu&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}), having received the [[Mandate of Heaven]] ({{zh|c={{linktext|天|命}}|p=tiānmìng|l=heaven decree}}), would nominally be the ruler of the entire world.  Although in practice there would be areas of the known world which were not under the control of the Emperor, in Chinese political theory the rulers of those areas derived their power from the Emperor.

The larger concept of ''tianxia'' is closely associated with [[civilization]] and order in classical Chinese philosophy, and has formed the basis for the [[world view]] of the Chinese people and nations influenced by them since at least the first millennium BC. ''Tianxia'' has been independently applied by other countries in the [[East Asian cultural sphere]], including Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.

==Historical and political development==
The ''tianxia'' [[world view]] was not fully developed during the [[Shang dynasty]].  Only during the [[Zhou dynasty]] when Heaven took on human deity traits (or at least when references to Heaven as such enter recorded history) did the concept of ''tianxia'' become common.  Terms like "Four Quarters" and "Ten Thousand States" appear in texts of the time; the term "Four Quarters" ({{zh|c=四方|p=sìfāng}}) means territory established by the royal court and governed by the Zhou kings from the capital, but with peripheral non-Han tribes on the outer borders and Han Chinese in the center.  The term "Ten Thousand States" ({{zh|t=萬邦|s=万邦|p=wànbāng}}) refers to both territory and the subjects who reside therein, both Han and "barbarian".  The Zhou kings received and empowered these "Ten Thousand States" by virtue of the [[Mandate of Heaven]].  This is some of the earliest evidence of the [[Hua-Yi distinction]].

During the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] and [[Warring States period]]s in the latter half of the Zhou dynasty, the power of the feudal lords developed rapidly, and several non-Han regions became powerful [[State (Ancient China)|states]] themselves.  As many of these feudal states had shared cultural and economic interests, the concept of a great nation centered on the [[Yellow River Plain]] gradually expanded.  The term ''tianxia'' began to appear in classical texts such as the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' and ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]''.

The territory and governments of the Zhou dynasty and the [[Qin dynasty]] were unified after [[Qin's wars of unification|the conquests]] of [[Qin Shi Huang]], and the concept of ''tianxia'' was adapted to act as an actual geographic entity.  Qin Shi Huang's goal to "unify all under Heaven" was, in fact, representative of his desire to control and expand Chinese territory. At the founding of the [[Han dynasty]], the equivalence of ''tianxia'' with the Chinese nation evolved due to the feudal practice of conferring land and autonomy upon the aristocracy to avoid having to expend military expense in their subjugation.  Although many areas enjoyed great autonomy, the practice established and spread Chinese language and culture throughout an even wider territory.

Unification theme applied to ''tianxia'' can be seen in [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'' where the supreme goal of offensive strategy was to conquer without destroying that which you sought to conquer:&lt;ref name="TheArtofWar" /&gt;

{{Quote|text=Your aim must be to take All-under-Heaven intact. Thus your troops are not worn out and your gains will be complete. This is the art of offensive strategy. |sign=[[Sun Tzu]]|source=''[[The Art of War]]'', Chapter III, Line 11}}

Unified China fractured into many different nations during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], and with it went the practical use of the term ''tianxia''.  When [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Emperor Gaozu]] reunited China under the [[Tang dynasty]] in the 7th century, some northern tribes, after being made vassal, referred to him as the "Khan of Heaven".

By the time of the [[Song dynasty]], China's northern borders were met by the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]-led [[Liao dynasty]], the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-led [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin dynasty]], and the [[Tangut people|Tangut]]-led [[Western Xia]] kingdom.  After being threatened by these northern states and realizing the possible effects of a war to the country and people, the Song rulers invented a false concept of kinship with the Jurchens in an attempt to improve relations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} The Mongols divided Chinese citizens into two types during the [[Yuan dynasty]]: those of the south, and those of the north.  When the [[Ming dynasty]] expelled the Mongols and reunited China under Han rule, the concept of ''tianxia'' returned largely as it was during the Han dynasty.

At the end of the Ming dynasty, criticisms of [[Neo-Confucianism]] and its mantras of "cultivation of moral character, establishment of family, ordering the state, and harmonizing ''tianxia''" (a quote from the [[Great Learning]]) became widespread, producing large shifts in [[Confucianism]].  Contemporary philosopher [[Wang Fuzhi]] believed that tianxia was of a fixed, unchangeable dimension, notwithstanding the fact that the Great Learning's mentioning of "harmonizing ''tianxia''" was actually in reference to government. Using these arguments, Wang was highly critical of Neo-Confucianism.  On the other hand, the collapse of the Ming dynasty and the establishment of the [[Qing dynasty]] by the [[Manchu people|Manchus]], people previously considered "fringe barbarians", heavily influenced people's views of ''tianxia''.  [[Gu Yanwu]], a contemporary of Wang Fuzhi, wrote that the destruction of the State was not equivalent to the destruction of ''tianxia''.  He argued that the Manchus simply filled the role of Emperor, and that the ''tianxia'' of traditional Chinese culture was thus carried on.

The idea of the absolute authority of the Chinese emperor and the extension of ''tianxia'' by the assimilation of vassal states began to fade for good with [[Earl Macartney]]'s embassy to China in 1793.  Earl Macartney hoped to deal with China as equal sovereign nations, as [[Great Britain]] would with other European nations of the time, and to persuade the Emperor to sign a trade agreement.  The [[Qianlong Emperor]] rejected his request, and stated that China was the foremost and most divine nation on Earth and had no interest in foreign goods, and rejected the idea that Great Britain could negotiate with China as an equal nation.  In the early 19th century, Britain's victory over Qing China in the [[First Opium War]] forced China to sign an [[unequal treaty]]. This marked the beginning of the end for the ''tianxia'' concept.

Following their defeat in the [[Second Opium War]], China was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Tianjin]], in which China was made to refer to Great Britain as a "sovereign nation", equal to itself.  This made it impossible for China to continue dealing with other nations under the traditional ''tianxia'' system, and forced it to establish a foreign affairs bureau.

Because Western nations' system of international affairs was based on the idea that the sovereign nations dealt with each other as equals, China's traditional ''tianxia'' [[world view]] slowly collapsed.  After China's defeat in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the Japanese terminated Korea's traditional status as a protectorate of China, and the system of feudal [[enfeoffment]] and vassalage that had been practiced since the Han dynasty came to an end, a move that greatly changed attitudes toward the ''tianxia'' concept.  At the end of the 19th century, Chinese Ambassador to Great Britain [[Xue Fucheng]] took the traditional [[Hua-Yi distinction]] in the ''tianxia'' world view and replaced it with a Chinese-foreigner distinction.

==Non-Chinese uses of the term==

===Japan===
References to ''tianxia'' first appear in Japanese history during the [[Kofun period]], approximately 250 to 538 AD.  At the time, Japanese rulers were respectful and submissive to the Chinese court, and Chinese immigrants (then called ''toraijin'' 渡來人) were received happily and sought after for their knowledge of the [[Chinese language]] and [[Chinese culture|culture]].  The excavated Eda Funayama grave mound in [[Kumamoto]] contained an iron sword with engraved [[Chinese characters|characters]] that dates to the late 5th century.  The characters on the sword refer to the king of the time as the "Grand King who rules all under ''Tianxia''" ({{zh|c=治天下大王}}).  This discovery demonstrates that the Kofun-era Japanese (at least of that area) had begun viewing their realm to be a complete and divinely-appointed ''tianxia'' in its own right, separate from the ''tianxia'' of the older and larger Chinese empire.

According to the ''[[Book of Sui]]'', the [[Yamato period|Yamato]] king in 607 sent a hand-written epistle to [[Emperor Yang of Sui|Emperor Yang]] of the [[Sui dynasty]] in which he called himself the "[[Son of Heaven]] in the Land of the Rising Sun" ({{zh|c=日出處天子}}), showing that the Japanese notion of their independent ''tianxia'' had continued to that time.

With the development of ''[[Ritsuryō]]'' in 7th-century Japan, a Sino-centric concept of ''tianxia'' was introduced and replaced older concepts.  The hallmark of ''Ritsuryō'' – the concept of [[citizenship]] – necessarily accompanied its introduction into Japan, since Neo-Confucianism said that all were "Equal Citizens Under Heaven" ({{zh|c=天下公民}}).

In the journals of  [[Fujiwara no Kanezane]] (藤原兼実、九條兼実), an official of the [[Kamakura shogunate]] whose journals became the ''Gyokuyō'' (玉葉), he describes the founding of the Shogunate by [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] as "beginning ''tianxia''".  His usage of ''tianxia'' is entirely ''Ritsuryō'' in nature, and his phrase "beginning ''tianxia''" refers to the establishment of a new nation, [[jurisprudence]], and system of order.  However, even if Yoritomo had the intention to become a monarch-level ruler, Japan's ''tianxia'' concept had not achieved the Chinese level of an Emperor who governed feudal kingdoms and was entrusted with the ordering of the world by Heaven.  In the journals of Gidō Shūshin (義堂周信), Gidō records a discussion he had with [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]] where the Shōgun repeatedly referred to his dominion as "''tianxia''".  In the [[Muromachi period]], people gradually began regarding the Shōgun as the representative of Heaven.

As the Muromachi shogunate weakened, regional warlords began fighting with each other for control of the nation.  More powerful nobles, such as [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], controlled large areas and viewed their domains as ''tianxia''.  The term was used with increasing frequency as generals sought to reunify Japan, and came to be equivalent with the land of Japan itself.

By the [[Edo period]], the ''[[shōgun]]'' was referred to as "Man of ''Tianxia''" and the Shogunate as "Court of ''Tianxia''".  The widespread adoption of the ''tianxia'' concept helped influence Japan's long period of isolation before the [[Meiji Restoration]].

===Korea===
Based on epitaphs dating to the 4th and 5th centuries, [[Goguryeo]] had concepts of [[Son of Heaven]] (天帝之子) and independent ''tianxia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yeongkwang |first1=Jo |title=Status and Tasks for Study of the Foreign Relations and World View of Koguryo in the Gwanggaeto Stele |journal=Dongbuga Yeoksa Nonchong |date=2015 |issue=49 |pages=70–76 |url=http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE06520451 |accessdate=3 November 2018 |language=ko |issn=1975-7840}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=고구려의 천하관 |url=http://contents.history.go.kr/front/hm/view.do?treeId=010201&amp;tabId=01&amp;levelId=hm_013_0010 |website=우리역사넷 |publisher=National Institute of Korean History |accessdate=3 November 2018 |language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of [[Goryeo]] used the titles of [[emperor]] and Son of Heaven and positioned Goryeo at the center of the ''Haedong'' "East of the Sea" ''tianxia'', which encompassed the historical domain of the "''Samhan''", another name for the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Em |first1=Henry |title=The Great Enterprise: Sovereignty and Historiography in Modern Korea |date=2013 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0822353725 |pages=24–26 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxAd2Aw_jP0C&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=3 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, with the fall of the Ming dynasty in China, a concept of Korea as the cultural center of Confucianism, or the "[[Sojunghwa|Little China]]" ({{Korean|소중화|小中華|labels=no}}), emerged among the Confucian literati of the Joseon dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Stefan |title=Writing the Nation: A Global Perspective |date=2007 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9780230223059 |page=126 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qIODDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=4 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
The [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] concept of ''tianxia'' as well as [[cultural identity]] originate in the [[Yuan dynasty]]'s invasion in the 13th century.  The [[Trần dynasty]]'s defeat of the Mongol-Chinese armies gave them the confidence to adopt their own ''tianxia'' view and become the official sustainers of the Kingdom of Vietnam.  From that time forward, the area from the [[Lingnan]] region of China to northern [[Vietnam]] was considered an independent ''tianxia''.  However, near the end of the [[Lê dynasty]] in the late 18th century, the orthodox idea of Vietnam as the Vietnamese king's dynasty fell out of favor, and Vietnam was referred to as "Great South" until the European conquests of [[Southeast Asia]].

==Western calques==
The "all under the heaven" expression became the origin for the literary expressions denoting China in a number of Western languages, such as the Russian ''Podnebesnaya'' (Поднебесная, i.e. "Under the heaven"). The English term "Celestial Empire" is said to have been based on the title of Chinese emperors, ''tian zi'' (Son of Heaven).&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Weekley, ''An etymological dictionary of modern English'', 1967. Page 270. (The ''tian zi'' etymology for the "Celestial Empire")&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trinitite''', also known as '''atomsite''' or '''Alamogordo glass''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/trinitite-trinity-test-mineral-cultural-jewelry|title=The Long, Weird Half-Life of Trinitite|last=Giaimo|first=Cara|date=2017-06-30|work=Atlas Obscura|access-date=2017-07-08|language=en|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[glass]]y residue left on the desert floor after the [[plutonium]]-based [[Trinity test|Trinity]] [[nuclear testing|nuclear bomb test]] on July 16, 1945, near [[Alamogordo]], [[New Mexico]].

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, samples were gathered and sold to [[mineral collector]]s as a [[novelty]]. Traces of the material may be found at the Trinity Site today,{{when|date=April 2018}} although most of it was bulldozed and buried by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll L. Tyler, AEC letter to the Governor of New Mexico, July 16, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now illegal to take the remaining material from the site; however, material that was taken prior to this prohibition is still in the hands of collectors.

==Formation==
In 2005 it was theorized by [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] scientist Robert Hermes and independent investigator William Strickfaden that much of the mineral was formed by sand which was drawn up inside the fireball itself and then rained down in a liquid form.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hermes and William Strickfaden, 2005, ''New Theory on the Formation of Trinitite'', Nuclear Weapons Journal {{cite web |url=http://www.wsmr.army.mil/pao/TrinitySite/NewTrinititeTheory.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726072410/http://www.wsmr.army.mil/pao/TrinitySite/NewTrinititeTheory.htm |archivedate=2008-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 article in ''Geology Today'', Nelson Eby of University of Massachusetts at Lowell and Robert Hermes described Trinitite: {{quote|text=Contained within the glass are melted bits of the first atomic bomb and the support structures and various radionuclides formed during the detonation. The glass itself is marvelously complex at the tens to hundreds of micrometre scale, and besides glasses of varying composition also contains unmelted quartz grains. Air transport of the melted material led to the formation of spheres and dumbbell shaped glass particles. Similar glasses are formed during all ground level nuclear detonations and contain forensic information that can be used to identify the atomic device.&lt;ref name="Trinitite the atomic rock"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Trinitite—the atomic rock  | date=24 September 2010 | author=Eby, N,  Hermes, R, Charnley N, Smoliga J | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2451.2010.00767.x | volume=26 |issue = 5| pages=180–185 | journal=Geology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The glass has been described as "a layer 1 to 2 centimeters thick, with the upper surface marked by a very thin sprinkling of dust which fell upon it while it was still molten. At the bottom is a thicker film of partially fused material, which grades into the soil from which it was derived. The color of the glass is a pale bottle green, and the material is extremely vesicular with the size of the bubbles ranging to nearly the full thickness of the specimen."&lt;ref name="optprop" /&gt;

An estimated 4.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; [[erg]]s or 4.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; [[joules]] of [[heat]] energy went into forming the glass and as the temperature required to melt the sand into the glass form observed was about 1470 Celsius, this was the estimated minimum temperature the sand was exposed to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lahdra.org/reports/LAHDRA%20Report%20v5%202007_App%20N_Trinity%20Test.pdf |title=INTERIM REPORT OF CDC'S LAHDRA PROJECT – Appendix N. pg 38 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317164653/http://www.lahdra.org/reports/LAHDRA%20Report%20v5%202007_App%20N_Trinity%20Test.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more unusual isotopes found in trinitite, although by no means unique as it may also have formed during the [[Joe-1]] test, which was a partial to complete [[Soviet]] replica of the Trinity/[[Fat Man]] design, is a barium [[neutron activation]] product, the [[barium]] in the Trinity device coming from the [[velocity of detonation|slow explosive]] lens employed in the device, known as [[Baratol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265931X05002316?np=y |title= Radioactivity in trinitite six decades later| doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2005.01.017 | pmid=16102878 |volume=85 |year=2006 |journal=J Environ Radioact |pages=103–20 | last1 = Parekh | first1 = PP | last2 = Semkow | first2 = TM | last3 = Torres | first3 = MA | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al|citeseerx= 10.1.1.494.5179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fake trinitite==
There are many known fakes in circulation among collectors.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  These fakes use a variety of means to achieve the glassy green silica look as well as mild radioactivity; however, only trinitite from a nuclear explosion will contain certain neutron activation products that are not found in naturally radioactive ores and minerals. [[Gamma spectroscopy]] can narrow down the potential nuclear explosions from which the material formed.

==Trinitite-type minerals==
Occasionally, the name ''trinitite'' is broadly applied to all glassy residues of nuclear bomb testing, not just the Trinity test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Lost Oasis: In Search Of Paradise |author= Robert Twigger |date= 2010 |publisher= Hachette |isbn= 9780297863878 |chapter= Eight |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJkGSF8SW_kC&amp;pg=PT85&amp;lpg=PT85&amp;focus=viewport&amp;dq=trinitite+asteroid |accessdate= 2014-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black vitreous fragments of fused sand that had been solidified by the heat of the explosion were described from French test site in [[Algeria]] ([[Reggane]] site).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1215_web_new.pdf Radiological Conditions at the Former French Nuclear Test Sites in Algeria: Preliminary Assessment and Recommendations] International Atomic Energy Agency, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kharitonchik===
Kharitonchiki (singular: kharitonchik, {{Lang-ru|харитончик}}) is an analog of trinitite found in [[Semipalatinsk Test Site]] in [[Kazakhstan]] at ground zeroes of Soviet atmospheric nuclear tests. Also generically called Kharitonchik. They are pieces of molten rock left at ground zeroes after Soviet atmospheric nuclear tests. This porous black material is named after one of the leading Russian nuclear weapons scientists, [[Yulii Borisovich Khariton]].&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2144264/entry/2144273/ "A Nuclear Family Vacation in Russia."] ''Slate.'' July 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trinitite-like minerals==
Trinitite has several similar naturally occurring minerals as it is itself a [[melt glass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Evidence for deposition of 10 million tonnes of impact spherules across four continents 12,800 y ago. |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |doi= 10.1073/pnas.1301760110 |pmid= 23690611 |vauthors=Wittke JH, Weaver JC, Bunch TE, Kennett JP, Kennett DJ, Moore AM, Hillman GC, Tankersley KB, Goodyear AC, Moore CR, Daniel IR Jr, Ray JH, Lopinot NH, Ferraro D, Israde-Alcántara I, Bischoff JL, DeCarli PS, Hermes RE, Kloosterman JB, Revay Z, Howard GA, Kimbel DR, Kletetschka G, Nabelek L, Lipo CP, Sakai S, West A, Firestone RB |date= 2013 |pmc=3677428 |volume=110 |issue=23 |pages=E2088–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fulgurites===
{{main|Fulgurite}}
While trinitite and similar materials are anthropogenic, [[fulgurites]], found in many [[thunderstorm]]-prone regions and in [[deserts]], are naturally-formed, hollow or solid [[glass]]y tubes, masses, droplets, clumps, or crusts composed of [[quartz]]ose [[sand]], [[silica]], rock, [[caliche]], biomass, [[clay]] or other [[soil]] and sediment types, and are generated by [[lightning]] strikes.

===Impact glasses===
{{further|Impactite}}
A material similar to trinitite can be formed by meteor impacts, these are [[impact glass]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.musilica.com/fused-silica/wine-bottle-art-ingenious-methods-to-recycle-wine-bottles/ |title= Wine Bottle Art – Ingenious Methods to Recycle Wine Bottles |publisher= Colloidal silicon dioxide |date= 16 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewelry and radiation hazard==
For a time it was believed that the desert sand had simply melted from the direct radiant thermal energy of the fireball and was not particularly dangerous.  Thus it was marketed as suitable for use in [[jewelry]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiochemistry.org/documents/pdf/trinitite_nuclearon_061608.pdf Steven L. Kay - Nuclearon - Trinitite varieties]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lahdra.org/reports/LAHDRA%20Report%20v5%202007_App%20N_Trinity%20Test.pdf |title=INTERIM REPORT OF CDC'S LAHDRA PROJECT – Appendix N. pg 39, 40 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317164653/http://www.lahdra.org/reports/LAHDRA%20Report%20v5%202007_App%20N_Trinity%20Test.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}

In [[physics]], a [[force]] is said to do '''work''' if, when acting, there is a [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] of the point of application in the direction of the force.  For example, when a ball is held above the ground and then dropped, the work done on the ball as it falls is equal to the weight of the ball (a force) multiplied by the distance to the ground (a displacement).

Work transfers energy from one place to another, or one form to another.

According to Jammer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jammer | first = Max  | title = Concepts of Force | publisher = Dover Publications, Inc. | year = 1957 | isbn = 0-486-40689-X |page=167; footnote 14 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CZtEBcmOe6gC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA167,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the term ''work'' was introduced in 1826 by the French mathematician [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]]&lt;ref&gt;Coriolis, Gustave. (1829). ''Calculation of the Effect of Machines, or Considerations on the Use of Engines and their Evaluation'' (''Du Calcul de l'effet des Machines, ou Considérations sur l'emploi des Moteurs et sur Leur Evaluation''). Paris: Carilian-Goeury, Libraire.&lt;/ref&gt; as "weight ''lifted'' through a height", which is based on the use of early [[steam engine]]s to lift buckets of water out of flooded ore mines. According to Dugas, it is to [[Salomon de Caus | Solomon of Caux]] "that we owe the term ''work'' in the sense that it is used in mechanics now".&lt;ref&gt;R. Dugas: *A History of Mechanics* (Éditions du Griffon, 1955) https://archive.org/details/historyofmachani000518mbp&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[SI unit]] of work is the [[joule]] (J).

==Units==
The SI unit of work is the [[joule]] (J), which is defined as the work expended by a force of one [[newton (unit)|newton]] through a displacement of one [[metre]].

The dimensionally equivalent [[newton-metre]] (N⋅m) is sometimes used as the measuring unit for work, but this can be confused with the unit newton-metre, which is the measurement unit of [[torque]]. Usage of N⋅m is discouraged by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|SI authority]], since it can lead to confusion as to whether the quantity expressed in newton metres is a torque measurement, or a measurement of work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-2/2-2-2.html ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-SI units of work include the newton-metre, [[erg]], the [[foot-pound (energy)|foot-pound]], the [[foot-poundal]], the [[kilowatt hour]], the [[litre-atmosphere]], and the [[horsepower|horsepower-hour]].  Due to work having the same [[Dimensional analysis|physical dimension]] as [[heat]], occasionally measurement units typically reserved for heat or energy content, such as [[therm]], [[BTU]] and [[Calorie]], are utilized as a measuring unit.

==Work and energy==
The work &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; done by a constant force of magnitude &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; on a point that moves a displacement &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; in a straight line in the direction of the force is the product
:&lt;math&gt;W = F s&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, if a force of 10 newtons (&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; = 10 N) acts along a point that travels 2 metres (&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; = 2 m), then &lt;math&gt;W = F s = (10\ N)(2\ m) = 20\ J.&lt;/math&gt; This is approximately the work done lifting a 1&amp;nbsp;kg object from ground level to over a person's head against the force of gravity.

The work is doubled either by lifting twice the weight the same distance or by lifting the same weight twice the distance.

Work is closely related to [[energy]]. The work-energy principle states that an increase in the kinetic energy of a rigid body is caused by an equal amount of positive work done on the body by the resultant force acting on that body. Conversely, a decrease in kinetic energy is caused by an equal amount of negative work done by the resultant force.

From [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]], it can be shown that work on a free (no fields), rigid (no internal degrees of freedom) body, is equal to the change in kinetic energy &lt;math&gt;KE&lt;/math&gt; of the linear velocity and angular velocity of that body,
:&lt;math&gt;W = \Delta KE.&lt;/math&gt;
The work of forces generated by a potential function is known as [[potential energy]] and the forces are said to be [[Conservative force|conservative]]. Therefore, work on an object that is merely displaced in a conservative force [[Field (physics)|field]], without change in velocity or rotation, is equal to ''minus'' the change of potential energy &lt;math&gt;PE&lt;/math&gt; of the object,
:&lt;math&gt;W = -\Delta PE.&lt;/math&gt;
These formulas show that work is the energy associated with the action of a force, so work subsequently possesses the [[Dimensional analysis|physical dimensions]], and units, of energy.
The work/energy principles discussed here are identical to Electric work/energy principles.

==Constraint forces==
Constraint forces limit the movement of components in a system, such as constraining an object to a surface (in the case of a slope plus gravity, the object is ''stuck to'' the slope, when attached to a taut string it cannot move in an outwards direction to make the string any 'tauter').  Constraint forces restrict the velocity in the direction of the constraint to zero, which means the constraint forces do not perform work on the system.

For a [[Virtual work|mechanical system]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Goldstein, Classical Mechanics, third edition. P.19&lt;/ref&gt; constraint forces eliminate movement in directions that characterize the constraint. Thus constraint forces do not perform work on the system, because the component of velocity along the constraint force at each point of application is zero. For example, in a pulley system like the [[Atwood machine]], the internal forces on the rope and at the supporting pulley do no work on the system. Therefore work need only be computed for the gravity forces acting on the bodies. 

For example, the [[centripetal force]] exerted ''inwards'' by a string on a ball in uniform [[circular motion]] ''sideways'' constrains the ball to circular motion restricting its movement away from the center of the circle.  This force does zero work because it is perpendicular to the velocity of the ball.

Another example is a book on a table.   If external forces are applied to the book so that it slides on the table, then the force exerted by the table constrains the book from moving downwards.  The force exerted by the table supports the book and is perpendicular to its movement which means that this constraint force does not perform work.

The [[magnetic force]] on a charged particle is {{nowrap|1='''F''' = ''q'''''v''' × '''B'''}}, where ''q'' is the charge, '''v''' is the velocity of the particle, and '''B''' is the [[magnetic field]]. The result of a [[cross product]] is always perpendicular to both of the original vectors, so {{nowrap|'''F''' ⊥ '''v'''}}. The [[dot product]] of two perpendicular vectors is always zero, so the work {{nowrap|1=''W'' = '''F''' ⋅ '''v''' = 0}}, and the magnetic force does not do work. It can change the direction of motion but never change the speed.

==Mathematical calculation==
For moving objects, the quantity of work/time (power) is integrated along the trajectory of the point of application of the force. Thus, at any instant, the rate of the work done by a force (measured in joules/second, or '''watts''') is the [[scalar product]] of the force (a vector), and the velocity vector of the point of application. This scalar product of force and velocity is known as instantaneous [[power (physics)|power]]. Just as velocities may be integrated over time to obtain a total distance, by the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], the total work along a path is similarly the time-integral of instantaneous power applied along the trajectory of the point of application.&lt;ref name="Resnick"&gt;Resnick, Robert and Halliday, David (1966), ''Physics'', Section 1–3 (Vol I and II, Combined edition), Wiley International Edition, Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 66-11527&lt;/ref&gt;

Work is the result of a force on a point that follows a curve '''X''', with a velocity '''v''', at each instant.  The small amount of work ''δW'' that occurs over an instant of time ''dt'' is calculated as
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W = \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{s} = \mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v}dt &lt;/math&gt;
where the {{nowrap|'''F''' ⋅ '''v'''}} is the power over the instant ''dt''.  The sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the point yields the work,
:&lt;math&gt;W =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{v}dt =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\mathbf{F} \cdot {\tfrac{d\mathbf{s}}{dt}}dt =\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{s},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''C'' is the trajectory from '''x'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to '''x'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  This integral is computed along the trajectory of the particle, and is therefore said to be ''path dependent''.

If the force is always directed along this line, and the magnitude of the force is ''F'', then this integral simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_C F\,ds&lt;/math&gt;
where ''s'' is displacement along the line. If '''F''' is constant, in addition to being directed along the line, then the integral simplifies further to
:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_C F\,ds = F\int_C ds = Fs&lt;/math&gt;
where ''s'' is the displacement of the point along the line.

This calculation can be generalized for a constant force that is not directed along the line, followed by the particle.  In this case the [[dot product]] {{nowrap|1='''F''' ⋅ ''d'''''s''' = ''F'' cos ''θ'' ''ds''}}, where ''θ'' is the angle between the force vector and the direction of movement,&lt;ref name="Resnick"/&gt; that is
:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{s} = Fs\cos\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

In the notable case of a force applied to a body always at an angle of 90° from the velocity vector (as when a body moves in a circle under a central force), no work is done at all, since the cosine of 90 degrees is zero. Thus, no work can be performed by gravity on a planet with a circular orbit (this is ideal, as all orbits are slightly elliptical). Also, no work is done on a body moving circularly at a constant speed while constrained by mechanical force, such as moving at constant speed in a frictionless ideal centrifuge.

=== Work done by a variable force ===

Calculating the work as "force times straight path segment" would only apply in the most simple of circumstances, as noted above. If force is changing, or if the body is moving along a curved path, possibly rotating and not necessarily rigid, then only the path of the application point of the force is relevant for the work done, and only the component of the force parallel to the application point [[velocity]] is doing work (positive work when in the same direction, and negative when in the opposite direction of the velocity). This component of force can be described by the scalar quantity called ''scalar tangential component'' (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle F\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the force and the velocity). And then the most general definition of work can be formulated as follows:
:''Work of a force is the line integral of its scalar tangential component along the path of its application point.''
:If the force varies (e.g. compressing a spring) we need to use calculus to find the work done.  If the force is given by F(x) (a function of x) then the work done by the force along the x-axis from a to b is:

&lt;math&gt;W = \int\limits_{a}^{b} \mathbf{F(s)} \cdot d\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;

===Torque and rotation===
A [[Couple (mechanics)|force couple]] results from equal and opposite forces, acting on two different points of a rigid body.  The sum (resultant) of these forces may cancel, but their effect on the body is the couple or torque '''T'''.  The work of the torque is calculated as
:&lt;math&gt; dW = \mathbf{T}\cdot\vec{\omega}dt,&lt;/math&gt;
where the {{nowrap|'''T''' ⋅ '''ω'''}} is the power over the instant ''δt''.  The sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the rigid body yields the work,
:&lt;math&gt;W =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\mathbf{T}\cdot\vec{\omega}dt.&lt;/math&gt;
This integral is computed along the trajectory of the rigid body with an angular velocity ω that varies with time, and is therefore said to be ''path dependent''.

If the angular velocity vector maintains a constant direction, then it takes the form,
:&lt;math&gt; \vec{\omega}= \dot{\phi}\mathbf{S},&lt;/math&gt;
where φ is the angle of rotation about the constant unit vector '''S'''.  In this case, the work of the torque becomes,
:&lt;math&gt;W =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\mathbf{T}\cdot\vec{\omega}dt = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\mathbf{T}\cdot \mathbf{S}\frac{d\phi}{dt}dt = \int_C\mathbf{T}\cdot \mathbf{S} d\phi,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''C'' is the trajectory from ''φ''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to ''φ''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  This integral depends on the rotational trajectory ''φ''(''t''), and is therefore path-dependent.

If the torque '''T''' is aligned with the angular velocity vector so that,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T}=\tau\mathbf{S},&lt;/math&gt;
and both the torque and angular velocity are constant, then the work takes the form,&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;W =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\tau \dot{\phi}dt = \tau(\phi_2-\phi_1).&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Work on the lever arm.svg|right|thumb|A force of constant magnitude and perpendicular to the lever arm]]

This result can be understood more simply by considering the torque as arising from a force of constant magnitude ''F'', being applied perpendicularly to a lever arm at a distance ''r'', as shown in the figure.  This force will act through the distance along the circular arc {{nowrap|1=''s'' = ''rφ''}}, so the work done is
:&lt;math&gt;W=Fs = Fr\phi .&lt;/math&gt;
Introduce the torque {{nowrap|1=''τ'' = ''Fr''}}, to obtain
:&lt;math&gt; W=Fr\phi=\tau\phi,&lt;/math&gt;
as presented above.

Notice that only the component of torque in the direction of the angular velocity vector contributes to the work.

==Work and potential energy==
The scalar product of a force '''F''' and the velocity '''v''' of its point of application defines the [[power (physics)|power]] input to a system at an instant of time.  Integration of this power over the trajectory of the point of application, {{nowrap|1=''C'' = '''x'''(''t'')}}, defines the work input to the system by the force.

===Path dependence===
Therefore, the [[mechanical work|work]] done by a force '''F''' on an object that travels along a curve ''C'' is given by the [[line integral]]:
:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{x} =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{v}dt,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''dx''(''t'') defines the trajectory ''C'' and '''v''' is the velocity along this trajectory.  In general this integral requires the path along which the velocity is defined, so the evaluation of work is said to be path dependent.

The time derivative of the integral for work yields the instantaneous power,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dW}{dt} = P(t) = \mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{v} .&lt;/math&gt;

===Path independence===
If the work for an applied force is independent of the path, then the work done by the force, by the [[gradient theorem]], defines a potential function which is evaluated at the start and end of the trajectory of the point of application. This means that there is a potential function ''U''('''x'''), that can be evaluated at the two points '''x'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''x'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to obtain the work over any trajectory between these two points. It is tradition to define this function with a negative sign so that positive work is a reduction in the potential, that is
:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{x} =  \int_{\mathbf{x}(t_1)}^{\mathbf{x}(t_2)} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{x} =  U(\mathbf{x}(t_1))-U(\mathbf{x}(t_2)).
&lt;/math&gt;

The function ''U''('''x''') is called the [[potential energy]] associated with the applied force.  The force derived from such a potential function is said to be [[Conservative force|conservative]]. Examples of forces that have potential energies are gravity and spring forces.  

In this case, the [[gradient]] of work yields
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla W =  -\nabla U= -\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial U}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial U}{\partial z}\right) = \mathbf{F},&lt;/math&gt;
and the force '''F''' is said to be "derivable from a potential."&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Taylor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=P1kCtNr-pJsC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Classical Mechanics,''] University Science Books, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the potential ''U'' defines a force '''F''' at every point '''x''' in space, the set of forces is called  a [[force field (physics)|force field]].  The power applied to a body by a force field is obtained from the gradient of the work, or potential, in the direction of the velocity '''V''' of the body, that is
:&lt;math&gt;P(t) = -\nabla U \cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Work by gravity===
[[File:Work of gravity F dot d equals mgh.JPG|right|thumb|Gravity {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''mg''}} does work {{nowrap|1=''W'' = ''mgh''}} along any descending path]]
In the absence of other forces, gravity results in a constant downward acceleration of every freely moving object. Near Earth's surface the acceleration due to gravity is {{nowrap|1=''g'' = 9.8&amp;nbsp;m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and the gravitational force on an object of mass ''m'' is {{nowrap|1='''F'''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = ''mg''}}. It is convenient to imagine this gravitational force concentrated at the center of mass of the object.

If an object is displaced upwards or downwards a vertical distance {{nowrap|''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the work ''W'' done on the object by its weight mg is:
:&lt;math&gt;W = F_g (y_2 - y_1) = F_g\Delta y = - mg\Delta y&lt;/math&gt;
where ''F&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' is weight (pounds in imperial units, and newtons in SI units), and Δ''y'' is the change in height ''y''. Notice that the work done by gravity depends only on the vertical movement of the object. The presence of friction does not affect the work done on the object by its weight.

===Work by gravity in space===
The force of gravity exerted by a mass ''M'' on another mass ''m'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}=-\frac{GMm}{r^3}\mathbf{r},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''r''' is the position vector from ''M'' to ''m''.

Let the mass ''m'' move at the velocity '''v''' then the work of gravity on this mass as it moves from position '''r'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to  '''r'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is given by
:&lt;math&gt; W=-\int^{\mathbf{r}(t_2)}_{\mathbf{r}(t_1)}\frac{GMm}{r^3}\mathbf{r}\cdot d\mathbf{r}=-\int^{t_2}_{t_1}\frac{GMm}{r^3}\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{v}dt.&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that the position and velocity of the mass ''m'' are given by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r} = r\mathbf{e}_r, \qquad\mathbf{v}=\dot{r}\mathbf{e}_r + r\dot{\theta}\mathbf{e}_t,&lt;/math&gt;
where '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; are the radial and tangential unit vectors directed relative to the vector from ''M'' to ''m''.  Use this to simplify the formula for work of gravity to,
:&lt;math&gt; W=-\int^{t_2}_{t_1}\frac{GmM}{r^3}(r\mathbf{e}_r)\cdot(\dot{r}\mathbf{e}_r + r\dot{\theta}\mathbf{e}_t)dt = -\int^{t_2}_{t_1}\frac{GmM}{r^3}r\dot{r}dt = \frac{GMm}{r(t_2)}-\frac{GMm}{r(t_1)}.&lt;/math&gt;
This calculation uses the fact that
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt}r^{-1}=-r^{-2}\dot{r}=-\frac{\dot{r}}{r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
The function
:&lt;math&gt; U=-\frac{GMm}{r}, &lt;/math&gt;
is the gravitational potential function, also known as [[gravitational potential energy]].  The negative sign follows the convention that work is gained from a loss of potential energy.

===Work by a spring===
[[File:Analogie ressorts contrainte.svg|upright|right|thumb|Forces in springs assembled in parallel]]

Consider a spring that exerts a horizontal force {{nowrap|1='''F''' = (−''kx'', 0, 0)}} that is proportional to its deflection in the ''x'' direction independent of how a body moves.  The work of this spring on a body moving along the space with the curve {{nowrap|1='''X'''(''t'') = (''x''(''t''), ''y''(''t''), ''z''(''t''))}}, is calculated using its velocity, {{nowrap|1='''v''' = (''v''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;W=\int_0^t\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v}dt =-\int_0^tkx v_x dt = -\frac{1}{2}kx^2. &lt;/math&gt;
For convenience, consider contact with the spring occurs at {{nowrap|1=''t'' = 0}}, then the integral of the product of the distance ''x'' and the x-velocity, ''xv''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, is (1/2)''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
The velocity is not a factor here. The work is the product of the distance times the spring force, which is also dependent on distance; hence the ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; result.

===Work by a gas===
:&lt;math&gt;W=\int_a^b{P}dV  &lt;/math&gt;
Where ''P'' is pressure, ''V'' is volume, and ''a'' and ''b'' are initial and final volumes.

==Work–energy principle==
The principle of work and [[kinetic energy]] (also known as the '''work–energy principle''') states that ''the work done by all forces acting on a particle (the work of the resultant force) equals the change in the kinetic energy of the particle.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| page = 654}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, the work ''W'' done by the [[resultant force]] on a [[particle]] equals the change in the particle's kinetic energy &lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;W=\Delta E_k=\tfrac12mv_2^2-\tfrac12mv_1^2&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; are the [[speed]]s of the particle before and after the work is done, and ''m'' is its [[mass]].

The derivation of the ''work–energy principle'' begins with [[Newton’s second law of motion]] and the resultant force on a particle.  Computation of the scalar product of the forces with the velocity of the particle evaluates the instantaneous power added to the system.&lt;ref&gt;B. Paul, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=JGMfULH-KK2r2AWIzICYAw&amp;id=3UdSAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=kinematics+and+dynamics+of+planar+machinery&amp;q=instantaneous+power#search_anchor ''Kinematics and Dynamics of Planar Machinery,''] Prentice-Hall, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constraints define the direction of movement of the particle by ensuring there is no component of velocity in the direction of the constraint force.   This also means the constraint forces do not add to the instantaneous power.   The time integral of this scalar equation yields work from the instantaneous power, and kinetic energy from the scalar product of velocity and acceleration.  The fact the work–energy principle eliminates the constraint forces underlies [[Lagrangian mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[E. T. Whittaker]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=OSckAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=analytical+dynamics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AGqvlTnrw7&amp;sig=x7DfbqV97-G73bWcuEFC-rU3h2s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9lobUPz8KofU2AW9sIGIDw&amp;ved=0CGcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  ''A treatise on the analytical dynamics of particles and rigid bodies,''] Cambridge University Press, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;

This section focuses on the work–energy principle as it applies to particle dynamics.  In more general systems work can change the [[potential energy]] of a mechanical device, the thermal energy in a thermal system, or the [[electrical energy]] in an electrical device.  Work transfers energy from one place to another or one form to another.

===Derivation for a particle moving along a straight line===
In the case the [[resultant force]] '''F''' is constant in both magnitude and direction, and parallel to the velocity of the particle, the particle is moving with constant acceleration ''a'' along a straight line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.wwu.edu/vawter/PhysicsNet/Topics/Work/WorkEngergyTheorem.html|title=Work–energy principle|author=|date=|website=wwu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The relation between the net force and the acceleration is given by the equation ''F'' = ''ma'' ([[Newton's second law]]), and the particle [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] ''s'' can be expressed by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;s = \frac{v_2^2 - v_1^2}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

which follows from &lt;math&gt;v_2^2 = v_1^2 + 2as&lt;/math&gt; (see [[SUVAT|Equations of motion]]).

The work of the net force is calculated as the product of its magnitude and the particle displacement. Substituting the above equations, one obtains:

:&lt;math&gt;W = Fs = mas = ma \left(\frac{v_2^2 - v_1^2}{2a}\right) = \frac{mv_2^2}{2} - \frac{mv_1^2}{2} = \Delta {E_k}&lt;/math&gt;

Other derivation:

:&lt;math&gt;W = Fs = mas = m \left(\frac{v_2^2 - v_1^2}{2s}\right) s&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;W = m \left(\frac{0_2^2 - v_1^2}{2s}\right) s&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;W = - \frac{1}{2} mv^2&lt;/math&gt;

Vertical displacement derivation

''W = F × S = mg × h''

In the general case of rectilinear motion, when the net force '''F''' is not constant in magnitude, but is constant in direction, and parallel to the velocity of the particle, the work must be integrated along the path of the particle:

:&lt;math&gt;W =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{v}dt =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2} F \,v dt =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2} ma \,v dt = m \int_{t_1}^{t_2} v \,{dv \over dt}\,dt = m \int_{v_1}^{v_2} v\,dv = \tfrac12 m (v_2^2 - v_1^2) .&lt;/math&gt;

===General derivation of the work–energy theorem for a particle===
For any net force acting on a particle moving along any curvilinear path, it can be demonstrated that its work equals the change in the kinetic energy of the particle by a simple derivation analogous to the equation above. Some authors call this result ''work–energy principle'', but it is more widely known as '''the work–energy theorem''':

:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{v}dt = m \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{v}dt = \frac{m}{2} \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{d v^2}{dt}\,dt = \frac{m}{2} \int_{v^2_1}^{v^2_2} d v^2 = \frac{mv_2^2}{2} - \frac{mv_1^2}{2} = \Delta {E_k} &lt;/math&gt;

The identity &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{d v^2}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; requires some algebra.
From the identity &lt;math&gt;\textstyle v^2 = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; and definition &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbf{a} = \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;
it follows
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d v^2}{dt} = \frac{d (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v})}{dt} = \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{dt} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{dt} = 2 \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{dt} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;.

The remaining part of the above derivation is just simple calculus, same as in the preceding rectilinear case.

===Derivation for a particle in constrained movement===
In particle dynamics, a formula equating work applied to a system to its change in kinetic energy is obtained as a first integral of [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]].  It is useful to notice that the resultant force used in Newton's laws can be separated into forces that are applied to the particle and forces imposed by constraints on the movement of the particle.  Remarkably, the work of a constraint force is zero, therefore only the work of the applied forces need be considered in the work–energy principle.

To see this, consider a particle P that follows the trajectory '''X'''(''t'') with a force '''F''' acting on it.  Isolate the particle from its environment to expose constraint forces '''R''', then Newton's Law takes the form
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} + \mathbf{R} =m\ddot{\mathbf{X}}, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the mass of the particle.

====Vector formulation====
Note that n dots above a vector indicates its nth [[time derivative]].
The [[scalar product]] of each side of Newton's law with the velocity vector yields
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{X}} = m\ddot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{X}},&lt;/math&gt;
because the constraint forces are perpendicular to the particle velocity.  Integrate this equation along its trajectory from the point '''X'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to the point '''X'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)  to obtain
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathbf{F}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{X}} dt = m\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\ddot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{X}}dt. &lt;/math&gt;

The left side of this equation is the work of the applied force as it acts on the particle along the trajectory from time ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to time ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  This can also be written as
:&lt;math&gt; W = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathbf{F}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{X}} dt =    \int_{\mathbf{X}(t_1)}^{\mathbf{X}(t_2)} \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{X}.  &lt;/math&gt;
This integral is computed along the trajectory '''X'''(''t'') of the particle and is therefore path dependent.

The right side of the first integral of Newton's equations can be simplified using the following identity
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2}\frac{d}{dt}(\dot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot \dot{\mathbf{X}}) = \ddot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{X}}, &lt;/math&gt;
(see [[product rule]] for derivation). Now it is integrated explicitly to obtain the change in kinetic energy,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta K = m\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\ddot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{X}}dt = \frac{m}{2}\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\frac{d}{dt}(\dot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot \dot{\mathbf{X}}) dt = \frac{m}{2}\dot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot \dot{\mathbf{X}}(t_2) - \frac{m}{2}\dot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot \dot{\mathbf{X}} (t_1) = \frac{1}{2}m \Delta \mathbf{v^{2}} , &lt;/math&gt;
where the kinetic energy of the particle is defined by the scalar quantity,
:&lt;math&gt; K = \frac{m}{2}\dot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot \dot{\mathbf{X}} =\frac{1}{2}m{\mathbf{v^{2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

====Tangential and normal components====
It is useful to resolve the velocity and acceleration vectors into tangential and normal components along the trajectory '''X'''(''t''), such that
:&lt;math&gt; \dot{\mathbf{X}}=v \mathbf{T},\quad\mbox{and}\quad \ddot{\mathbf{X}}=\dot{v}\mathbf{T} + v^2\kappa \mathbf{N}. &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; v=|\dot{\mathbf{X}}|=\sqrt{\dot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{X}}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Then, the [[scalar product]] of velocity with acceleration in Newton's second law takes the form
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta K = m\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\dot{v}vdt = \frac{m}{2}\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\frac{d}{dt}v^2  dt = \frac{m}{2}v^2(t_2) - \frac{m}{2}v^2(t_1), &lt;/math&gt;.
where the kinetic energy of the particle is defined by the scalar quantity,
:&lt;math&gt; K = \frac{m}{2} v^2 = \frac{m}{2} \dot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{X}}. &lt;/math&gt;

The result is the work–energy principle for particle dynamics,
:&lt;math&gt; W = \Delta K. \!&lt;/math&gt;
This derivation can be generalized to arbitrary rigid body systems.

===Moving in a straight line (skid to a stop)===
Consider the case of a vehicle moving along a straight horizontal trajectory under the action of a driving force and gravity that sum to '''F'''.  The constraint forces between the vehicle and the road define '''R''', and we have
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} + \mathbf{R} =m\ddot{\mathbf{X}}. &lt;/math&gt;
For convenience let the trajectory be along the X-axis, so {{nowrap|1='''X''' = (''d'', 0)}} and the velocity is {{nowrap|1='''V''' = (''v'', 0)}}, then {{nowrap|1='''R''' ⋅ '''V''' = 0}}, and {{nowrap|1='''F''' ⋅ '''V''' = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''v''}}, where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is the component of '''F''' along the X-axis, so
:&lt;math&gt; F_x v = m\dot{v}v.&lt;/math&gt;
Integration of both sides yields
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{t_1}^{t_2}F_x v dt =  \frac{m}{2}v^2(t_2) - \frac{m}{2}v^2(t_1). &lt;/math&gt;
If F&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is constant along the trajectory, then the integral of velocity is distance, so
:&lt;math&gt; F_x (d(t_2)-d(t_1)) =  \frac{m}{2}v^2(t_2) - \frac{m}{2}v^2(t_1). &lt;/math&gt;

As an example consider a car skidding to a stop, where ''k'' is the coefficient of friction and ''W'' is the weight of the car.  Then the force along the trajectory is {{nowrap|1=''F''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = −''kW''}}.  The velocity ''v'' of the car can be determined from the length ''s'' of the skid using the work–energy principle,
:&lt;math&gt;kWs = \frac{W}{2g} v^2,\quad\mbox{or}\quad v = \sqrt{2ksg}.&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that this formula uses the fact that the mass of the vehicle is {{nowrap|1=''m'' = ''W''/''g''}}.

===Coasting down a mountain road (gravity racing)===
Consider the case of a vehicle that starts at rest and coasts down a mountain road, the work-energy principle helps compute the minimum distance that the vehicle travels to reach a velocity ''V'', of say 60&amp;nbsp;mph (88 fps).  Rolling resistance and air drag will slow the vehicle down so the actual distance will be greater than if these forces are neglected.

Let the trajectory of the vehicle following the road be '''X'''(''t'') which is a curve in three-dimensional space.  The force acting on the vehicle that pushes it down the road is the constant force of gravity {{nowrap|1='''F''' = (0, 0, ''W'')}}, while the force of the road on the vehicle is the constraint force '''R'''.  Newton's second law yields,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} + \mathbf{R} =m\ddot{\mathbf{X}}. &lt;/math&gt;
The [[scalar product]] of this equation with the velocity, {{nowrap|1='''V''' = (''v''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, yields
:&lt;math&gt; W v_z = m\dot{V}V,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V'' is the magnitude of '''V'''.  The constraint forces between the vehicle and the road cancel from this equation because {{nowrap|1='''R''' ⋅ '''V''' = 0}}, which means they do no work.
Integrate both sides to obtain
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{t_1}^{t_2}W v_z dt =  \frac{m}{2}V^2(t_2) - \frac{m}{2}V^2(t_1). &lt;/math&gt;
The weight force ''W'' is constant along the trajectory and the integral of the vertical velocity is the vertical distance, therefore,
:&lt;math&gt; W \Delta z =  \frac{m}{2}V^2. &lt;/math&gt;
Recall that V(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)=0. Notice that this result does not depend on the shape of the road followed by the vehicle.

In order to determine the distance along the road assume the downgrade is 6%, which is a steep road.  This means the altitude decreases 6 feet for every 100 feet traveled—for angles this small the sin and tan functions are approximately equal.  Therefore, the distance ''s'' in feet down a 6% grade to reach the velocity ''V'' is at least
:&lt;math&gt; s=\frac{\Delta z}{0.06}= 8.3\frac{V^2}{g},\quad\mbox{or}\quad s=8.3\frac{88^2}{32.2}\approx 2000\mbox{ft}.&lt;/math&gt;
This formula uses the fact that the weight of the vehicle is {{nowrap|1=''W'' = ''mg''}}.

==Work of forces acting on a rigid body==
The work of forces acting at various points on a single rigid body can be calculated from the work of a [[resultant force|resultant force and torque]].  To see this, let the forces '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; act on the points '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in a rigid body.

The trajectories of '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''  are defined by the movement of the rigid body.  This movement is given by the set of rotations [''A''(''t'')] and the trajectory '''d'''(''t'') of a reference point in the body.  Let the coordinates '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''  define these points in the moving rigid body's  [[Cartesian coordinate system|reference frame]] ''M'', so that the trajectories traced in the fixed frame ''F'' are given by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X}_i(t)= [A(t)]\mathbf{x}_i + \mathbf{d}(t)\quad i=1,\ldots, n. &lt;/math&gt;

The velocity of the points '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; along their trajectories  are
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i = \vec{\omega}\times(\mathbf{X}_i-\mathbf{d}) + \dot{\mathbf{d}},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''ω''' is the angular velocity vector obtained from the skew symmetric matrix
:&lt;math&gt; [\Omega] = \dot{A}A^\mathrm{T},&lt;/math&gt;
known as the angular velocity matrix.

The small amount of work by the forces over the small displacements ''δ'''''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be determined by approximating the displacement by {{nowrap|1=''δ'''''r''' = '''v'''''δt''}} so
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W = \mathbf{F}_1\cdot\mathbf{V}_1\delta t+\mathbf{F}_2\cdot\mathbf{V}_2\delta t + \ldots + \mathbf{F}_n\cdot\mathbf{V}_n\delta t&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W =  \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{F}_i\cdot (\vec{\omega}\times(\mathbf{X}_i-\mathbf{d}) + \dot{\mathbf{d}})\delta t. &lt;/math&gt;

This formula can be rewritten to obtain
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W =  \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{F}_i\right)\cdot\dot{\mathbf{d}}\delta t + \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \left(\mathbf{X}_i-\mathbf{d}\right)\times\mathbf{F}_i\right) \cdot \vec{\omega}\delta t = \left(\mathbf{F}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{d}}+ \mathbf{T}\cdot \vec{\omega}\right)\delta t, &lt;/math&gt;
where '''F''' and '''T''' are the [[resultant force|resultant force and torque]] applied at the reference point '''d''' of the moving frame ''M'' in the rigid body.
