Anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at [[Research stations in Antarctica|research stations]] scattered across the continent. Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of [[algae]], [[bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]], [[plant]]s, [[protist]]a, and certain [[animal]]s, such as [[mite]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[penguin]]s, [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[tardigrade]]s. Vegetation, where it occurs, is [[tundra]].

Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' ("Southern Land") date back to antiquity, Antarctica is noted as the last region on Earth in recorded history to be discovered, unseen until 1820 when the [[List of Russian explorers|Russian expedition]] of [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]] and [[Mikhail Lazarev]] on ''[[Vostok (sloop-of-war)|Vostok]]'' and ''[[Mirny (sloop-of-war)|Mirny]]'' sighted the [[Fimbul ice shelf]]. The continent, however, remained largely neglected for the rest of the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of easily accessible resources, and isolation. In 1895, the first confirmed landing was conducted by a team of Norwegians.

Antarctica is a ''de facto'' [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]], governed by parties to the [[Antarctic Treaty System]] that have consulting status. Twelve countries signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1959, and thirty-eight have signed it since then. The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining, prohibits nuclear explosions and nuclear waste disposal, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's [[ecozone]]. Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 scientists from many nations.

==Etymology==
[[File:Adelie Penguins on iceberg.jpg|thumb|[[Adelie penguins]] in Antarctica]]
The name ''Antarctica'' is the [[Romanization of Greek|romanised]] version of the [[Greek language|Greek]] compound word ἀνταρκτική (''antarktiké''), feminine of [[wikt:ἀνταρκτικός|ἀνταρκτικός]] (''antarktikós''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liddell |first1=Henry George |last2=Scott |first2=Robert |editor-last=Crane |editor-first=Gregory R. |contribution=Antarktikos |title=A Greek–English Lexicon |series=Perseus Digital Library |publisher=Tufts University |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%239514 |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "opposite to the [[Arctic]]", "opposite to the north".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hince |first=Bernadette |date=2000 |title=The Antarctic Dictionary |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |isbn=978-0-9577471-1-1 |page=6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lJd8_owUxFEC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=antarctica+opposite+of+north+greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] wrote in his book ''Meteorology'' about an ''Antarctic region'' in c.&amp;nbsp;350 BC&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.2.ii.html Meteorologica.] Book II, Part 5. 350 BCE. Translated by E. Webster. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1923. 140 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Marinus of Tyre]] reportedly used the name in his unpreserved world map from the 2nd century CE.  The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] authors [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] and [[Apuleius]] (1–2 centuries CE) used for the South Pole the romanised Greek name ''polus antarcticus,''&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GlWM1eMefB8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage De astronomia.] Ed. G. Viré. Stuttgart: Teubner, 1992. 176 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apuleii. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MJ8MAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage Opera omnia.] Volumen tertium. London: Valpy, 1825. 544 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; from which derived the [[Old French]] ''pole antartike'' (modern ''pôle antarctique'') attested in 1270, and from there the [[Middle English]] ''pol antartik'' in a 1391 technical treatise by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (modern ''Antarctic Pole'').&lt;ref&gt;G. Chaucer. [http://art-bin.com/art/oastro.html A Treatise on the Astrolabe.] Approx. 1391. Ed. W. Skeat. London: N. Trübner, 1872. 188 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before acquiring its present geographical connotations, the term was used for other locations that could be defined as "opposite to the north". For example, the short-lived French colony established in [[Brazil]] in the 16th century was called "[[France Antarctique]]".

The first formal use of the name "Antarctica" as a continental name in the 1890s is attributed to the Scottish [[Cartography|cartographer]] [[John George Bartholomew]].&lt;ref&gt;John George Bartholomew and the naming of Antarctica, CAIRT Issue 13, National Library of Scotland, July 2008, ISSN 1477-4186, and also {{cite web |title=The Bartholomew Archive |url=http://digital.nls.uk/bartholomew/highlights/antarctica.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change of name==
The long-imagined (but undiscovered) south polar continent was originally called ''[[Terra Australis]]'', sometimes shortened to 'Australia' as seen in a woodcut illustration titled ''Sphere of the winds'', contained in an astrological textbook published in Frankfurt in 1545.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barth |first1=Cyriaco Jacob zum |title=Astronomia: Teutsch Astronomei |date=1545 |location=Frankfurt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the longer Latin phrase was better known, the shortened name ''Australia'' was used in Europe's scholarly circles.

Then in the nineteenth century, the colonial authorities in [[Sydney]] removed the Dutch name from [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. Instead of inventing a new name to replace it, they took the name ''Australia'' from the south polar continent, leaving it nameless for some eighty years. During that period, geographers had to make do with clumsy phrases such as "the Antarctic Continent". They searched for a more poetic replacement, suggesting various names such as Ultima and Antipodea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty: Captain Cook's Endeavour Voyage |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |location=Sydney |isbn=9780648043966 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually ''Antarctica'' was adopted in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Woodburn |first1=Susan |title=John George Bartholomew and the naming of Antarctica |journal=Cairt |date=July 2008 |issue=13 |pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica has no indigenous population, and there is no evidence that it was seen by humans until the 19th century. However, in February 1775, during his [[Second voyage of James Cook|second voyage]], [[James Cook|Captain Cook]] called the existence of such a polar continent "probable" and in another copy of his journal he wrote:"[I] '''firmly believe''' it and its '''more than''' probable that we have seen a part of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beaglehole |first1=J.C. |title=Cook, Journals, vol.2 |date=1968 |publisher=Hakluyt Society |location=Cambridge |isbn=9781472453242 |page=643, n.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, belief in the existence of a ''[[Terra Australis]]''—a vast continent in the far south of the globe to "balance" the northern lands of [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North Africa]]—had prevailed since the times of [[Ptolemy]] in the 1st century AD. Even in the late 17th century, after explorers had found that [[South America]] and [[Australia]] were not part of the fabled "Antarctica", geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual size.
[[File:James Weddell Expedition.jpg|thumb|Painting of [[James Weddell]]'s second expedition in 1823, depicting the brig ''Jane'' and the cutter ''Beaufroy'']]

Integral to the story of the origin of Antarctica's name is that it was not named ''Terra Australis''—this name was [[Australia#Etymology|given to Australia instead]], because of the misconception that no significant landmass could exist further south. Explorer [[Matthew Flinders]], in particular, has been credited with popularising the transfer of the name ''Terra Australis'' to Australia. He justified the titling of his book ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]'' (1814) by writing in the introduction:

{{quote|There is no probability, that any other detached body of land, of nearly equal extent, will ever be found in a more southern latitude; the name Terra Australis will, therefore, remain descriptive of the geographical importance of this country and of its situation on the globe: it has antiquity to recommend it; and, having no reference to either of the two claiming nations, appears to be less objectionable than any other which could have been selected.&lt;ref&gt;Flinders, Matthew.

European maps continued to show this hypothesised land until Captain [[James Cook]]'s ships, {{HMS|Resolution|1771|6}} and {{HMS|Adventure|1771|2}}, crossed the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773, in December 1773 and again in January 1774.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Age of Exploration: John Cook |publisher=The Mariners' Museum |url=http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php |accessdate=12 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207175624/http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php&lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=7 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook came within about {{convert|75|mi|km|order=flip|-1|abbr=on}} of the Antarctic coast before retreating in the face of field ice in January 1773.&lt;ref&gt;James Cook, ''The Journals'', edited by Philip Edwards.

On 22 January 1840, two days after the discovery of the coast west of the [[Balleny Islands]], some members of the crew of the 1837–40 expedition of [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] disembarked on the highest islet&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ats.aq/documents/ATCM29/wp/ATCM29_wp019_f.doc "''Proposition de classement du rocher du débarquement dans le cadre des sites et monuments historiques''"] {{fr icon}}.

In December 1839, as part of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] of 1838–42 conducted by the [[United States Navy]] (sometimes called the "Ex. Ex.", or "the Wilkes Expedition"), an expedition sailed from [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], into the Antarctic Ocean, as it was then known, and reported the discovery "of an Antarctic continent west of the Balleny Islands" on 25 January 1840. That part of Antarctica was named "[[Wilkes Land]]", a name it retains to this day.

Explorer [[James Clark Ross]] passed through what is now known as the [[Ross Sea]] and discovered [[Ross Island]] (both of which were named after him) in 1841. He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the [[Ross Ice Shelf]]. [[Mount Erebus]] and [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]] are named after two ships from his expedition: {{HMS|Erebus|1826|6}} and {{HMS|Terror|1813|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=South-Pole – Exploring Antarctica |work=South-Pole.com |url=http://www.south-pole.com/p0000081.htm |accessdate=12 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214042438/http://www.south-pole.com/p0000081.htm |archivedate=14 February 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mercator Cooper]] landed in [[East Antarctica]] on 26 January 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=9 February 2005 |title=Antarctic Circle – Antarctic First |url=http://www.antarctic-circle.org/firsts.htm |accessdate=12 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208102813/http://www.antarctic-circle.org/firsts.htm |archivedate=8 February 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Nimrod Expedition]] led by [[Ernest Shackleton]] in 1907, parties led by [[Edgeworth David]] became the first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the [[South Magnetic Pole]].

Positioned asymmetrically around the [[South Pole]] and largely south of the Antarctic Circle, Antarctica is the southernmost continent and is surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]; alternatively, it may be considered to be surrounded by the southern [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and [[Indian Ocean]]s, or by the southern waters of the [[World Ocean]]. There are a number of rivers and lakes in Antarctica, the longest river being the [[Onyx River|Onyx]]. The largest lake, [[Lake Vostok|Vostok]], is one of the largest sub-glacial lakes in the world. Antarctica covers more than {{convert|14|e6km2|sqmi|abbr=unit}},&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People"/&gt; making it the fifth-largest continent, about 1.3 times as large as Europe. The coastline measures {{convert|17968|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People"/&gt; and is mostly characterised by ice formations, as the following table shows:

Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the Ross Sea and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called West Antarctica and the remainder East Antarctica, because they roughly correspond to the Western and Eastern Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]].

[[File:Antarctica surface.jpg|thumb|left|Elevation coloured by relief height]]

About 98% of Antarctica is covered by the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], a [[ice sheet|sheet of ice]] averaging at least {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} thick. The continent has about 90% of the world's ice (and thereby about 70% of the world's [[fresh water]]). If all of this ice were melted, sea levels would rise about {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/question473.htm|title=How Stuff Works: polar ice caps|publisher=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=12 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204205054/http://science.howstuffworks.com/question473.htm|archivedate=4 February 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most of the interior of the continent, [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is very low, down to {{convert|20|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year; in a few "[[Blue ice (glacial)|blue ice]]" areas precipitation is lower than mass loss by [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]], and so the local mass balance is negative. In the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys|dry valleys]], the same effect occurs over a rock base, leading to a desiccated landscape.

[[West Antarctica]] is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. The sheet has been of recent concern because of the small possibility of its collapse. If the sheet were to break down, [[Sea level change|ocean levels]] would rise by several metres in a relatively [[geologic time scale|geologically short]] period of time, perhaps a matter of centuries. Several Antarctic [[ice stream]]s, which account for about 10% of the ice sheet, flow to one of the many [[Ice shelf#Antarctic ice shelves|Antarctic ice shelves]]: see [[ice-sheet dynamics]].

East Antarctica lies on the Indian Ocean side of the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] and comprises [[Coats Land]], [[Queen Maud Land]], [[Enderby Land]], [[Mac. Robertson Land|&lt;abbr title="Macpherson"&gt;Mac&lt;/abbr&gt;. Robertson Land]], [[Wilkes Land]], and [[Victoria Land]]. All but a small portion of this region lies within the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]. East Antarctica is largely covered by the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]].

[[File:Mount Erebus Aerial 2.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Erebus]], an active volcano on [[Ross Island]]]]

[[Vinson Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at {{convert|4892|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. Antarctica contains [[List of mountains in Antarctica|many other mountains]], on both the main continent and the surrounding islands. Mount Erebus on [[Ross Island]] is the world's southernmost active volcano. Another well-known volcano is found on [[Deception Island]], which is famous for a giant eruption in 1970. Minor eruptions are frequent, and lava flow has been observed in recent years. Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk//about_antarctica/geography/rock/volcanoes.php|title=Volcanoes|author=British Antarctic Survey|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|accessdate=13 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711081129/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/geography/rock/volcanoes.php|archivedate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a potentially active underwater volcano was found in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] by American and Canadian researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100385|title=Scientists Discover Undersea Volcano Off Antarctica|publisher=United States National Science Foundation|accessdate=13 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica is home to more than 70 lakes that lie at the base of the continental ice sheet. [[Lake Vostok]], discovered beneath Russia's [[Vostok Station]] in 1996, is the largest of these [[subglacial lake]]s. It was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for 500,000 to one million years, but a recent survey suggests that, every so often, there are large flows of water from one lake to another.&lt;ref name="Briggs2006"&gt;{{cite news|last=Briggs|first=Helen|date=19 April 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4908292.stm|title=Secret rivers found in Antarctic|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence, in the form of [[ice core]]s drilled to about {{convert|400|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} above the water line, that Lake Vostok's waters may contain [[microorganism|microbial life]].

===Geological history and palaeontology===
More than 170&amp;nbsp;million years ago, Antarctica was part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. Over time, Gondwana gradually broke apart, and Antarctica as we know it today was formed around 25&amp;nbsp;million years ago. Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.

====Palaeozoic era (540–250 Ma)====
During the [[Cambrian|Cambrian period]], Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was partially in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and during this period large amounts of [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor [[invertebrate]]s and [[trilobite]]s flourished in the tropical seas. By the start of the [[Devonian|Devonian period]] (416&amp;nbsp;[[annum|Ma]]), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. [[Sand]] and [[silt]]s were laid down in what is now the [[Ellsworth Mountains|Ellsworth]], [[Horlick Mountains|Horlick]] and [[Pensacola Mountains]]. [[Glaciation]] began at the end of the Devonian period (360&amp;nbsp;Ma), as Gondwana became centred on the South Pole and the climate cooled, though [[Antarctic flora|flora]] remained. During the [[Permian]] period, the land became dominated by seed plants such as ''[[Glossopteris]]'', a pteridosperm which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. Towards the end of the Permian period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.&lt;ref name="Stonehouse"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Stonehouse|editor-first=B.|title=Encyclopedia of Antarctica and the Southern Oceans|date=June 2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-98665-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mesozoic era (250–66 Ma)====
As a result of continued warming, the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert. In Eastern Antarctica, [[seed fern]]s or pteridosperms became abundant and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time. [[Synapsid]]s, commonly known as "mammal-like reptiles", were common in Antarctica during the [[Early Triassic]] and included forms such as ''[[Lystrosaurus]]''. The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the [[Jurassic]] period (206–146&amp;nbsp;Ma), and islands gradually rose out of the ocean. [[Ginkgo]] trees, conifers, bennettites, horsetails, ferns and [[cycad]]s were plentiful during this period. In West Antarctica, [[conifer]]ous [[forest]]s dominated through the entire [[Cretaceous]] period (146–66&amp;nbsp;Ma), though [[Nothofagus|southern beech]] became more prominent towards the end of this period. [[Ammonite]]s were common in the seas around Antarctica, and dinosaurs were also present, though only three Antarctic dinosaur [[genera]] (''[[Cryolophosaurus]]'' and ''[[Glacialisaurus]]'', from the [[Hanson Formation]],&lt;ref name="SmithPol2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Nathan D.|last2=Pol|first2=Diego|date=2007|title=Anatomy of a basal sauropodomorph dinosaur from the Early Jurassic Hanson Formation of Antarctica|journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica|volume=52|issue=4|pages=657–674|url=http://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app52/app52-657.pdf|format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Antarctopelta]]'') have been described to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leslie, Mitch |title=The Strange Lives of Polar Dinosaurs |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/polar-dinosaurs-200712.html |publisher=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]] |date=December 2007 |accessdate=24 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080130062646/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/polar-dinosaurs-200712.html |archivedate=30 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this era that Gondwana began to break up.

However, there is some evidence of antarctic marine glaciation during the [[Cretaceous]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Bornemann, Norris RD, Friedrich O, Beckmann B, Schouten S, Damsté JS, Vogel J, Hofmann P, Wagner T., Isotopic evidence for glaciation during the Cretaceous supergreenhouse.

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gondwana breakup (160–23 Ma)====
The cooling of Antarctica occurred stepwise, as the continental spread changed the oceanic currents from longitudinal equator-to-pole temperature-equalising currents to latitudinal currents that preserved and accentuated latitude temperature differences.

Africa separated from Antarctica in the Jurassic, around 160&amp;nbsp;Ma, followed by the [[Indian subcontinent]] in the early Cretaceous (about 125&amp;nbsp;Ma). By the end of the Cretaceous, about 66&amp;nbsp;Ma, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a subtropical climate and flora, complete with a [[marsupial]] [[fauna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reinhold, Robert|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/21/us/antarctica-yields-first-land-mammal-fossil.html|title=Antarctica yields first land mammal fossil|journal=New York Times|date=21 March 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Eocene]] epoch, about 40&amp;nbsp;Ma Australia-[[New Guinea]] separated from Antarctica, so that latitudinal currents could isolate Antarctica from Australia, and the first ice began to appear.  During the [[Eocene–Oligocene extinction event]] about 34&amp;nbsp;million years ago, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels have been found to be about 760 ppm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news172072921.html|title=New CO2 data helps unlock the secrets of Antarctic formation|publisher=Physorg.com|accessdate=26 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715082838/http://www.physorg.com/news172072921.html|archivedate=15 July 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm.

Around 23 Ma, the [[Drake Passage]] opened between Antarctica and South America, resulting in the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] that completely isolated the continent. Models of the changes suggest that declining CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels became more important.&lt;ref name="DeContoPollard2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeConto|first1=Robert M.|last2=Pollard|first2=David|title=Rapid Cenozoic glaciation of Antarctica induced by declining atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Nature|volume=421|pages=245–9|date=16 January 2003|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6920/abs/nature01290.html|doi=10.1038/nature01290|accessdate=19 October 2009|issue=6920|pmid=12529638 |bibcode = 2003Natur.421..245D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ice began to spread, replacing the forests that then covered the continent.

====Neogene Period (23–0.05 Ma)====
Since about 15 Ma, the continent has been mostly covered with ice.&lt;ref name="Trewby2002"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Trewby|editor-first=Mary|date=September 2002|title=Antarctica: An Encyclopedia from Abbott Ice Shelf to Zooplankton|publisher=Firefly Books|isbn=1-55297-590-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meyer Desert Formation biota====
{{main|Meyer Desert Formation biota}}
Fossil ''[[Nothofagus]]'' leaves in the Meyer Desert Formation of the [[Sirius Group]] show that intermittent warm periods allowed ''Nothofagus'' shrubs to cling to the [[Dominion Range]] as late as 3–4 Ma (mid-late [[Pliocene]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=New grounds for reassessing palaeoclimate of the Sirius Group |date=2001 |journal=Journal of the Geological Society, London |volume=158|pages=925–35 | doi=10.1144/0016-764901-030 | last1=Retallack | first1=G.J. | last2=Krull | first2=E.S. | last3=Bockheim | first3=J.G. | issue=6|bibcode=2001JGSoc.158..925R }}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the [[Pleistocene]] ice age covered the whole continent and destroyed all major plant life on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-4164401.html |author= Stefi Weisburd |title=A forest grows in Antarctica.

The geological study of Antarctica has been greatly hindered by nearly all of the continent being permanently covered with a thick layer of ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoveringantarctica.org.uk/alevel_1_3.html|title=Antarctica's geology|publisher=Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) in partnership with the British Antarctic Survey and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office|accessdate=31 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141122142909/http://www.discoveringantarctica.org.uk/alevel_1_3.html|archivedate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, new techniques such as [[remote sensing]], [[ground-penetrating radar]] and [[satellite imagery]] have begun to reveal the structures beneath the ice.

Geologically, West Antarctica closely resembles the [[Andes]] mountain range of South America.&lt;ref name="Stonehouse" /&gt; The [[Antarctic Peninsula]] was formed by uplift and [[metamorphism]] of sea bed sediments during the late [[Paleozoic]] and the early [[Mesozoic]] eras. This sediment uplift was accompanied by [[igneous]] intrusions and [[volcanism]]. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are [[andesite]] and [[rhyolite]] volcanics formed during the Jurassic period. There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in [[Marie Byrd Land]] and [[Alexander Island]]. The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the [[Ellsworth Mountains]] region, where the [[stratigraphy]] is more similar to East Antarctica.

East Antarctica is geologically varied, dating from the [[Precambrian]] era, with some rocks formed more than 3&amp;nbsp;billion years ago. It is composed of a [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous]] platform which is the basis of the [[Shield (geology)|continental shield]]. On top of this base are coal and various modern rocks, such as [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. In coastal areas such as [[Shackleton Range]] and [[Victoria Land]] some [[fault (geology)|faulting]] has occurred.

The main mineral resource known on the continent is coal.&lt;ref name="Trewby2002" /&gt; It was first recorded near the [[Beardmore Glacier]] by [[Frank Wild]] on the [[Nimrod Expedition]], and now low-grade coal is known across many parts of the Transantarctic Mountains. The [[Prince Charles Mountains]] contain significant deposits of iron ore. The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore, namely the [[oil field|oil]] and [[natural gas field]]s found in the Ross Sea in 1973. Exploitation of all mineral resources is [[Ban (law)|banned]] until 2048 by the [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]].

Antarctica is the coldest of [[Earth]]'s continents. It used to be ice-free until about 34 million years ago, when it became covered with ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2016/03/09/science.aad6284|title=How Antarctica got its ice|first1=Caroline H.|last1=Lear|first2=Dan J.|last2=Lunt|date=10 March 2016|publisher=|journal=Science|pages=aad6284|via=science.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/science.aad6284|pmid=26966192|bibcode=2016Sci...352...34L}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coldest natural air temperature ever recorded on Earth was {{convert|−89.2|C|F|1|abbr=on}} at the Soviet (now [[Russia]]n) [[Vostok Station]] in Antarctica on 21 July 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecolocalizer.com/2008/12/14/the-coldest-inhabited-places-on-earth/|title=The Coldest Inhabited Places on Earth|work=Eco Localizer|date=14 December 2008|author=Hudson, Gavin|accessdate=8 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327115134/http://ecolocalizer.com/2008/12/14/the-coldest-inhabited-places-on-earth/ |archivedate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, this is 10.7&amp;nbsp;°C (20&amp;nbsp;°F) colder than [[sublimation (chemistry)|subliming]] [[dry ice]] at one atmosphere of partial pressure, but since CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; only makes up 0.039% of air, temperatures of less than {{convert|−140|C|F|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="AgeeOrton2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agee|first1=Ernest|last2=Orton|first2=Andrea|last3=Rogers|first3=John|title=CO2Snow Deposition in Antarctica to Curtail Anthropogenic Global Warming|journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology|volume=52|issue=2|year=2013|pages=281–288|issn=1558-8424|doi=10.1175/JAMC-D-12-0110.1|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JAMC-D-12-0110.1|accessdate=8 January 2018|bibcode=2013JApMC..52..281A}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be needed to produce dry ice snow in Antarctica.

Temperatures reach a minimum of between {{convert|−80|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|−89.2|C|F|abbr=on}} in the interior in winter and reach a maximum of between {{convert|5|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|15|C|F|0|abbr=on}} near the coast in summer. [[Sunburn]] is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects almost all of the ultraviolet light falling on it.  Given the latitude, long periods of constant darkness or constant sunlight create climates unfamiliar to human beings in much of the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="BAS-weather"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/weather/weather.htm|title=Weather in the Antarctic|author=British Antarctic Survey|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|accessdate=9 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AntarcticaDomeCSnow.jpg|thumb|left|The snow surface at [[Dome C]] [[Concordia Station|Station]] is typical of most of the continent's surface.]]
East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. [[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the centre cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended periods. Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to {{convert|1.22|m|in|0}} in 48 hours have been recorded.

At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the [[polar plateau]] often blow at storm force. In the interior, wind speeds are typically moderate. During clear days in summer, more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface at the South Pole than at the [[equator]] because of the 24 hours of sunlight each day at the Pole.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People" /&gt;

Antarctica is colder than the [[Arctic]] for three reasons. First, much of the continent is more than {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation in the [[troposphere]]. Second, the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the Earth is at [[aphelion]] in July (i.e., the Earth is farthest from the Sun in the Antarctic winter), and the Earth is at [[perihelion]] in January (i.e., the Earth is closest to the Sun in the Antarctic summer). The orbital distance contributes to a colder Antarctic winter (and a warmer Antarctic summer) but the first two effects have more impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geography.about.com/od/physicalgeography/a/orbitsun.htm The Earth's Elliptical Orbit Around the Sun&amp;nbsp;– Aphelion and Perihelion]. Geography.about.com. Retrieved on 21 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[aurora australis]], commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the South Pole created by the plasma-full [[solar wind]]s that pass by the Earth. Another unique spectacle is [[diamond dust]], a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. It generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation. A [[sun dog]], a frequent atmospheric [[optical phenomenon]], is a bright "spot" beside the true [[sun]].&lt;ref name="BAS-weather" /&gt;

Several governments maintain permanent manned [[research station]]s on the continent. The number of people conducting and supporting scientific research and other work on the continent and its nearby islands varies from about 1,000 in winter to about 5,000 in the summer, giving it a [[population density]] between 70 and 350 inhabitants per million square kilometres (180 and 900 per million square miles) at these times. Many of the stations are staffed year-round, the winter-over personnel typically arriving from their home countries for a one-year assignment. An [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox church]]—[[Trinity Church (Antarctica)|Trinity Church]], opened in 2004 at the Russian [[Bellingshausen Station]]—is manned year-round by one or two priests, who are similarly rotated every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.rs/eng/flock_antarcticas_orthodox_temple_celebrates_holy_trinity_day|title=Flock of Antarctica's Orthodox temple celebrates Holy Trinity Day|publisher=Serbian Orthodox Church|date=24 May 2004|accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pravoslavye.org.ua/index.php?action=fullinfo&amp;r_type=&amp;id=22495|script-title=ru:Владимир Петраков: 'Антарктика – это особая атмосфера, где живут очень интересные люди'|language=ru}} (Vladimir Petrakov: "Antarctic is a special world, full of very interesting people").

The first semi-permanent inhabitants of regions near Antarctica (areas situated south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]]) were British and American [[Seal hunting|sealers]] who used to spend a year or more on [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]], from 1786 onward. During the [[whaling]] era, which lasted until 1966, the population of that island varied from over 1,000 in the summer (over 2,000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter. Most of the whalers were Norwegian, with an increasing proportion of Britons. The settlements included [[Grytviken]], [[Leith Harbour]], [[King Edward Point]], [[Stromness, South Georgia|Stromness]], [[Husvik]], [[Prince Olav Harbour]], [[Ocean Harbour]] and [[Godthul]]. Managers and other senior officers of the whaling stations often lived together with their families. Among them was the founder of Grytviken, Captain [[Carl Anton Larsen]], a prominent Norwegian whaler and explorer who, along with his family, adopted British citizenship in 1910.

The first child born in the [[Antarctic Convergence|southern polar region]] was Norwegian girl [[Solveig Gunbjørg Jacobsen]], born in Grytviken on 8 October 1913, and her birth was registered by the resident British Magistrate of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]. She was a daughter of Fridthjof Jacobsen, the assistant manager of the whaling station, and Klara Olette Jacobsen. Jacobsen arrived on the island in 1904 and became the manager of Grytviken, serving from 1914 to 1921; two of his children were born on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Headland, Robert K.|title=The Island of South Georgia|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1984|isbn=978-0-521-25274-4|oclc=473919719|pages=12, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species of marine animals exist and rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue whale]]s, [[orca]]s, [[colossal squid]]s and [[fur seal]]s. The [[emperor penguin]] is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the [[Adélie penguin]] breeds farther south than any other penguin. The [[southern rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s, [[chinstrap penguin]]s, and [[gentoo penguin]]s also breed in the Antarctic.

The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. The [[Weddell seal]], a "[[true seal]]", is named after [[James Weddell|Sir James Weddell]], commander of British sealing expeditions in the [[Weddell Sea]]. [[Antarctic krill]], which congregate in large [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]], is the [[keystone species]] of the [[ecosystem]] of the [[Southern Ocean]], and is an important food organism for whales, seals, [[leopard seal]]s, fur seals, [[squid]], [[Notothenioidei|icefish]], penguins, [[albatross]]es and many other birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm|title=Creatures of Antarctica|accessdate=6 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214015049/http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm|archivedate=14 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A census of sea life carried out during the [[International Polar Year]] and which involved some 500 researchers was released in 2010. The research is part of the global [[Census of Marine Life]] and has disclosed some remarkable findings. More than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions, having bridged the gap of {{convert|12000|km|0|abbr=on}}. Large animals such as some cetaceans and birds make the round trip annually. More surprising are small forms of life such as [[sea cucumbers]] and free-swimming snails found in both polar oceans. Various factors may aid in their distribution&amp;nbsp;– fairly uniform temperatures of the deep ocean at the poles and the equator which differ by no more than 5&amp;nbsp;°C, and the major current systems or marine [[Thermohaline circulation|conveyor belt]] which transport eggs and larval stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kinver|first=Mark|date=15 February 2009|title=Ice oceans 'are not poles apart'|newspaper=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7888558.stm|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fungi===
[[File:Lichen squamulose.jpg|thumb|About 400 species of [[lichen]]-forming fungi are known to exist in Antarctica.]]
About 1,150 species of fungi have been recorded from Antarctica, of which about 750 are non-lichen-forming and 400 are lichen-forming.&lt;ref name="basplants"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bridge, Paul D.|author2=Spooner, Brian M.|author3=Roberts, Peter J.|date=2008|title=Non-lichenized fungi from the Antarctic region|journal=Mycotaxon|volume=106|pages=485–490|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0106/0485.htm|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these species are [[endolith|cryptoendoliths]] as a result of evolution under extreme conditions, and have significantly contributed to shaping the impressive rock formations of the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] and surrounding mountain ridges. The apparently simple morphology, scarcely differentiated structures, metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to harsh environments such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. In particular, their thick-walled and strongly melanised cells make them resistant to [[UV light]]. Those features can also be observed in algae and [[cyanobacteria]], suggesting that these are adaptations to the conditions prevailing in Antarctica. This has led to speculation that, if life ever occurred on Mars, it might have looked similar to Antarctic fungi such as ''[[Cryomyces antarcticus]]'', and ''[[Cryomyces minteri]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackyeast2010.bf.uni-lj.si/fileadmin/userfiles/Lectures/Onofri.pdf|title=Survival of Black Fungi in Space, Preliminary Results|author=Onofri, S.|author2=Selbmann, L.|author3=Zucconi, L.|author4=Scalzi, G.|author5=Venkateswaran, K.J.|author6=de la Torre, R.|author7=de Vera, J.-P.|author8=Ott, S.|author9=Rabbow, E.|author10=Horneck, G.|last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these fungi are also apparently endemic to Antarctica. Endemic Antarctic fungi also include certain dung-inhabiting species which have had to evolve in response to the double challenge of extreme cold while growing on dung, and the need to survive passage through the gut of warm-blooded animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=de Hoog, G.S.|date=2005|title=Fungi of the Antarctic: evolution under extreme conditions|journal=Studies in Mycology|volume=51|pages=1–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plants===
About 298 million years ago [[Permian]] forests started to cover the continent, and [[tundra]] vegetation survived as late as 15 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://telanganatoday.news/antarctica-green-scientists|title=Antarctica was once green: Scientists|date=15 April 2017|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423062932/https://telanganatoday.news/antarctica-green-scientists|archivedate=23 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the climate of present-day Antarctica does not allow extensive vegetation to form. A combination of freezing temperatures, poor [[soil]] quality, lack of moisture, and lack of sunlight inhibit plant growth. As a result, the diversity of plant life is very low and limited in distribution. The [[flora]] of the continent largely consists of [[bryophyte]]s. There are about 100 species of [[moss]]es and 25 species of [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]], but only three species of [[flowering plant]]s, all of which are found in the Antarctic Peninsula: ''[[Deschampsia antarctica]]'' (Antarctic hair grass), ''[[Colobanthus quitensis]]'' (Antarctic pearlwort) and the non-native ''[[Poa annua]]'' (annual bluegrass).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0032247414000916|title=''Poa annua'' L. in the maritime Antarctic: an overview|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Katarzyna_Chwedorzewska/publication/270217066_Poa_annua_L._in_the_maritime_Antarctic_an_overview/links/54a30c080cf267bdb9042e47.pdf|journal=Polar Record |volume =51|issue =6 |date=2015|pages=637–643|author=Chwedorzewska, K.J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth is restricted to a few weeks in the summer.&lt;ref name="basplants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/wildlife/plants/index.php|title=Plants of Antarctica|author=British Antarctic Survey|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|accessdate=12 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607115623/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk//about_antarctica/wildlife/plants/index.php|archivedate=7 June 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aadplants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/fact-files/plants|title=Antarctic Wildlife|author=Australian Antarctic Division|publisher=Government of Australia|accessdate=27 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828190048/http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/fact-files/plants|archivedate=28 August 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other organisms===

===Conservation===
[[File:Antarctica, pollution, environment, Russia, Bellingshausen 1.JPG|thumb|left|Dumping of waste, including old vehicles, such as here at the Russian Bellingshausen Station in 1992, is prohibited since the entry into force of the Protocol on Environmental Protection in 1998.]]
The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (also known as the Environmental Protocol or Madrid Protocol) came into force in 1998, and is the main instrument concerned with conservation and management of [[biodiversity]] in Antarctica. The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting is advised on environmental and conservation issues in Antarctica by the Committee for Environmental Protection. A major concern within this committee is the risk to Antarctica from unintentional introduction of non-native species from outside the region.&lt;ref name="BridgeHughes73"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bridge|first1=Paul D.|first2=Kevin. A.|last2=Hughes|date=2010|title=Conservation issues for Antarctic fungi|journal=Mycologia Balcanica|volume=7|issue=1|pages=73–76|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59687/0007/001/0073.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passing of the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]] (1978) in the U.S. brought several restrictions to U.S. activity on Antarctica. The introduction of [[introduced species|alien]] plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The [[overfishing]] of [[krill]], which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People" /&gt; Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of [[Patagonian toothfish]] (marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S.), remains a serious problem. The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing, with estimates of 32,000&amp;nbsp;[[tonne]]s (35,300&amp;nbsp;short tons) in 2000.&lt;ref name="KirbyBBC-2001"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirby|first=Alex|date=15 August 2001|title=Toothfish at risk from illegal catches|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1492380.stm|accessdate=22 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AUgovAntartica-toothfish"&gt;{{cite web|title=Toothfish|publisher=Australian Antarctic Division|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/fact-files/animals/fish/toothfish|accessdate=22 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of 60° S for the purposes of the Treaty System. The treaty was signed by twelve countries including the [[Soviet Union]] (and later Russia), the United Kingdom, [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Australia]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.aq/devAS/ats_parties.aspx?lang=e|title=Antarctic Treaty System – Parties|publisher=Antarctic Treaty and the Secretariat|accessdate=20 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation and environmental protection, and banned military activity on Antarctica.

The Argentine, British and Chilean claims all overlap, and have caused friction. On 18 December 2012, the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] named a previously unnamed area [[Queen Elizabeth Land]] in tribute to [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]].&lt;ref name="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Foreign Secretary has announced that the southern part of British Antarctic Territory has been named Queen Elizabeth Land|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/queen-elizabeth-land|work=Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 2012, the UK ambassador to Argentina, [[John Freeman (diplomat)|John Freeman]], was summoned to the Argentine government as protest against the claim.&lt;ref name="BBC News: Argentine Protest Against Queen Elizabeth Land"&gt;{{cite web|title=Argentina angry after Antarctic territory named after Queen|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20822582|work=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentine–UK relations had previously been damaged throughout 2012 due to disputes over the sovereignty of the nearby [[Falkland Islands]], and the 30th anniversary of the [[Falklands War]].

The areas shown as [[Australian Antarctic Territory|Australia's]] and [[Ross Dependency|New Zealand's]] claims were British territory until they were handed over following the countries' independence. Australia currently claims the largest area. The claims of Britain, Australia, New Zealand, France and Norway are all recognised by each other.

Other countries participating as members of the Antarctic Treaty have a territorial interest in Antarctica, but the provisions of the Treaty do not allow them to make their claims while it is in force.&lt;ref name="peecug1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.jid.org/en/mono38/nieto.htm |title=La Antartica |publisher=Library.jid.org |accessdate=4 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007084832/http://library.jid.org/en/mono38/nieto.htm |archivedate=7 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peecug2"&gt;[http://www.afese.com/img/revistas/revista40/laantartida.pdf Afese.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707092226/http://www.afese.com/img/revistas/revista40/laantartida.pdf |date=7 July 2011 }}.

==Economy==

There is no economic activity in Antarctica at present, except for fishing off the coast and small-scale [[Tourism in Antarctica|tourism]], both based outside Antarctica.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People"/&gt;

Although coal, [[hydrocarbon]]s, iron ore, [[platinum]], [[copper]], [[chromium]], [[nickel]], gold and other minerals have been found, they have not been in large enough quantities to exploit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Natural Resources|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/print_2111.html|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1991 [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] also restricts a struggle for resources. In 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000–01 reported landing 112,934&amp;nbsp;tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fisheries News|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2003/11/30/fisheries-news|publisher=mecropress|date=30 November 2003|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small-scale "expedition tourism" has existed since 1957 and is currently subject to Antarctic Treaty and Environmental Protocol provisions, but in effect self-regulated by the [[International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators]] (IAATO). Not all vessels associated with Antarctic tourism are members of IAATO, but IAATO members account for 95% of the tourist activity. Travel is largely by small or medium ship, focusing on specific scenic locations with accessible concentrations of iconic wildlife. A total of 37,506 tourists visited during the 2006–07 [[Southern Hemisphere|Austral summer]] with nearly all of them coming from commercial ships; 38,478 were recorded in 2015–16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://30atcm.ats.aq/30atcm/Documents/Docs/fr/Atcm30_fr001_e.doc |title=Final Report, 30th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting |publisher=[[Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]] |accessdate=2 August 2007 |format=DOC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808034540/http://30atcm.ats.aq/30atcm/Documents/Docs/fr/Atcm30_fr001_e.doc |archivedate=8 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/political.htm|title=Politics of Antarctica|accessdate=5 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214014631/http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/political.htm|archivedate=14 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iaato.org/documents/10157/1444539/2015-2016+Tourists+by+Nationality+(Total)/9a4fe29b-1c44-45cc-96b2-246e93137b2f|title=2015–2016 Tourists by Nationality Total|publisher=IAATO|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some concern over the potential adverse environmental and ecosystem effects caused by the influx of visitors. Some environmentalists and scientists have made a call for stricter regulations for ships and a tourism quota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/734551/Tourism-%27threatens-Antarctic%27.html|title=''Tourism threatens Antarctic''|publisher=Telegraph UK|accessdate=5 February 2006|location=London|first=Mark|last=Rowe|date=11 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary response by Antarctic Treaty Parties has been to develop, through their Committee for Environmental Protection and in partnership with IAATO, "site use guidelines" setting landing limits and closed or restricted zones on the more frequently visited sites. Antarctic sightseeing flights (which did not land) operated out of Australia and New Zealand until the fatal crash of [[Air New Zealand Flight 901]] in 1979 on Mount Erebus, which killed all 257 aboard. [[Qantas]] resumed commercial overflights to Antarctica from Australia in the mid-1990s.

Antarctic fisheries in 1998–99 (1 July&amp;nbsp;– 30 June) reported landing 119,898 tonnes legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Antarctica-Year-In-Review-1999|title=Antarctica in 1999|work=Britannica Book of the Year|author=Guthridge, Guy|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About thirty countries maintain about seventy [[Research stations in Antarctica|research stations]] (40 year-round or permanent, and 30 summer-only) in Antarctica, with an approximate population of 4000 in summer and 1000 in winter.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People"/&gt;

The station can be seen at far left, the [[power plant]] in the centre and the mechanic's garage in the lower right. The green light in the background is the [[Aurora Australis|aurora.]]]]

Each year, scientists from 28 different nations conduct [[experiment]]s not reproducible in any other place in the world. In the summer more than 4,000 scientists operate [[research station]]s; this number decreases to just over 1,000 in the winter.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People" /&gt; [[McMurdo Station]], which is the largest research station in Antarctica, is capable of housing more than 1,000 scientists, visitors, and tourists.

Researchers include [[biologist]]s, [[geologist]]s, [[Oceanography|oceanographers]], [[physicist]]s, [[astronomer]]s, [[Glaciology|glaciologists]], and [[Meteorology|meteorologists]]. Geologists tend to study [[plate tectonics]], meteorites from [[outer space]], and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]]. Glaciologists in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and [[Ice-sheet dynamics|dynamics]] of floating ice, [[snow|seasonal snow]], [[glacier]]s, and [[ice sheet]]s. Biologists, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures. Astrophysicists at [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]] study the celestial dome and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. Many astronomical observations are better made from the interior of Antarctica than from most surface locations because of the high elevation, which results in a thin atmosphere; low temperature, which minimises the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere; and absence of [[light pollution]], thus allowing for a view of space clearer than anywhere else on Earth. Antarctic ice serves as both the shield and the detection medium for the largest [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory|neutrino telescope]] in the world, built {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} below Amundsen–Scott station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/science/index.shtml |title=Science in Antarctica |publisher=Antarctic Connection |accessdate=4 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207003148/http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/science/index.shtml |archivedate=7 February 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s an important focus of study has been the [[ozone layer]] in the [[atmosphere]] above Antarctica. In 1985, three British scientists working on data they had gathered at [[Halley Station]] on the [[Brunt Ice Shelf]] discovered the existence of a hole in this layer. It was eventually determined that the destruction of the ozone was caused by [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs) emitted by human products. With the ban of CFCs in the [[Montreal Protocol]] of 1989, climate projections indicate that the ozone layer will return to 1980 levels between 2050 and 2070.&lt;ref name=adelie&gt;{{cite web|url=https://birdsnews.com/2014/adelie-penguins-thriving-amid-antarcticas-melting-ice/|title=Adelie Penguins thriving amid Antarctica's melting ice|author=Graham, Rex|date=15 July 2014|accessdate=24 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605053724/https://birdsnews.com/2014/adelie-penguins-thriving-amid-antarcticas-melting-ice/|archivedate=5 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006 [[NASA]] satellite data revealed that the Antarctic [[ozone hole]] was larger than at any other time on record, at {{convert|2750000|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ozone record"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/ozone_record.html|title=NASA and NOAA Announce Ozone Hole is a Double Record Breaker|publisher=Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA|date=19 October 2006 |accessdate=6 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013021957/http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/ozone_record.html |archivedate=13 October 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impacts of the depleted ozone layer on climate changes occurring in Antarctica are not well understood.&lt;ref name=adelie/&gt;

In 2007 [[The Polar Geospatial Center]] was founded.  The Polar Geospatial Center uses [[Geospatial technology|geospatial]] and [[remote sensing]] technology to provide mapping services to American federally funded research teams.  Currently, the Polar Geospatial Center can image all of Antarctica at 50&amp;nbsp;cm resolution every 45 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directionsmag.com/articles/polar-geospatial-center-releases-new-application-with-high-res-satelli/370342|title=Polar Geospatial Center Releases New Application with High-Res Satellite Imagery|author=Rejcek, Peter|publisher=The Antarctic Sun|date=2 December 2013|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 2007 Belgian-based International Polar Foundation unveiled the [[Princess Elisabeth Antarctica|Princess Elisabeth station]], the world's first zero-emissions polar science station in Antarctica to [[research]] [[climate change]]. Costing $16.3&amp;nbsp;million, the [[prefabricated]] station, which is part of the [[International Polar Year]], was shipped to the South Pole from [[Belgium]] by the end of 2008 to monitor the [[health]] of the [[polar region]]s.

===Meteorites===
[[File:ALH84001.jpg|thumb|left|Antarctic meteorite, named [[ALH84001]], from [[Mars]]]]
[[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are an important area of study of material formed early in the [[solar system]]; most are thought to come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger [[planet]]s. The first meteorite was found in 1912, and named the [[Adelie Land meteorite]]. In 1969, a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved.&lt;ref name="meteorite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm|title=Meteorites from Antarctica|publisher=NASA|accessdate=9 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306122117/http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm|archivedate=6 March 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.&lt;ref name="meteorite"/&gt;

[[File:Flow of Ice Across Antarctica.ogv|thumb|upright=1.35|The motion of ice in Antarctica]]

Due to its location at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation except along the southern summer. This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. [[Precipitation]] is low (most of Antarctica is a [[desert]]) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as [[ice stream]]s, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many [[ice shelf|ice shelves]]. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from [[seawater]] through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.

Sea ice extent expands annually in the Antarctic winter and most of this ice melts in the summer. This ice is formed from the ocean water and floats in the same water and thus does not contribute to rise in sea level. The [[Measurement of sea ice#Sea ice extent|extent]] of [[sea ice]] around Antarctica has remained roughly constant in recent decades, although the thickness changes are unclear.&lt;ref name="United Nations Environment Programme"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |url=https://www.grida.no/resources/5268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="National Snow and Ice Data Center"&gt;{{cite web|title=All About Sea Ice: Characteristics: Arctic vs. Antarctic|publisher=National Snow and Ice Data Center|url=http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317034609/http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html|archivedate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melting of floating ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) does not in itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However, it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.&lt;ref name="RignotCasassa2004"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1029/2004GL020697| last1 = Rignot | first1 = E.| last2 = Casassa | first2 = G.| last3 = Gogineni | first3 = P.| last4 = Krabill | first4 = W.| last5 = Rivera | first5 = A.| last6 = Thomas | first6 = R.| date = 2004| title = Accelerated ice discharge from the Antarctic Peninsula following the collapse of Larsen B ice shelf| journal = [[Geophysical Research Letters]]| volume = 31| issue = 18| pages = L18401| url = http://www.glaciologia.cl/textos/RignotetalGRLPeninsulaAccel.pdf| accessdate = 22 October 2011| bibcode = 2004GeoRL..3118401R| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123070917/http://www.glaciologia.cl/textos/RignotetalGRLPeninsulaAccel.pdf| archivedate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the continent itself, the large volume of ice present stores around 70% of the world's fresh water.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks" /&gt; This ice sheet is constantly gaining ice from snowfall and losing ice through outflow to the sea.

Sheperd et al. 2012, found that different satellite methods for measuring ice mass and change were in good agreement and combining methods leads to more certainty with East Antarctica, West Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula changing in mass by +14 ± 43, –65 ± 26, and –20 ± 14 [[gigatonnes]] (Gt) per year.&lt;ref name="IMBIE2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Ivins | first2 = Erik | collaboration = [[Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise|IMBIE]] team | title = A Reconciled Estimate of Ice-Sheet Mass Balance | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 338 | issue=6111 | pages = 1183–1189 | date = 2012-11-30 | doi = 10.1126/science.1228102| bibcode = 2012Sci...338.1183S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same group's 2018 [[systematic review]] study estimated that ice loss across the entire continent was 43 gigatonnes per year on average during the period from 1992 to 2002 but has accelerated to an average of 220 gigatonnes per year during the five years from 2012 to 2017.&lt;ref name="IMBIE2018"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Ivins | first2 = Erik | collaboration = [[Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise|IMBIE]] team | title = Mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet from 1992 to 2017 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 558 | pages = 219–222 | date = 2018-06-13 | doi = 10.1038/s41586-018-0179-y | lay-url = https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/latest-estimate-shows-how-much-antarctic-ice-has-fallen-into-the-sea/ | lay-source = [[Ars Technica]] | lay-date = 2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA's Climate Change website indicates a compatible overall trend of greater than 100 gigatonnes of ice loss per year since 2002.&lt;ref name="landice"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/land-ice/ |title=Land Ice |publisher=NASA Global Climate Change |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single 2015 study by H. Jay Zwally et al. found instead that the net change in ice mass is slightly positive at approximately 82 gigatonnes per year (with significant regional variation) which would result in Antarctic activity reducing global sea-level rise by 0.23 mm per year.&lt;ref name="ZwallyEtAl2015"&gt;{{cite journal |first=H.

Eric Rignot, who has worked on similar Antarctic studies, has been fielding a lot of questions about this one and shared his comments with Ars. “I am afraid I have some rather harsh words about it,” he wrote. Rignot said the data just aren’t precise enough to support the paper's conclusions.¶ “Zwally's group is the only one pushing its interpretation beyond the realm of the inherent uncertainty of the data. Accumulation of snow in East Antarctica is 10 centimeters water equivalent per year. To detect changes in accumulation of 136 gigatons (with no error bar), or 10 percent, Zwally et al. needs to detect changes of the order of 1 centimeter. Current technology such as ICESat cannot detect any change smaller than 20 centimeters. Radar altimetry (used for the earlier period) is closer to 40-50 centimeter noise, but nobody really knows. There is no way to detect changes in East Antarctic accumulation at the 10 percent level, not even 50 percent level, with those kinds of error bars,” Rignot wrote.¶ He continued, “The Zwally group’s findings are at odds with all other independent methods: re-analysis, gravity measurements, mass budget method, and other groups using the same data.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East Antarctica is a cold region with a ground base [[Height above mean sea level|above sea level]] and occupies most of the continent. This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows. The mass balance of the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]] as a whole is thought to be slightly positive (lowering sea level) or near to balance.&lt;ref name="ShepherdWingham2007"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.1136776| last1 = Shepherd | first1 = A.| last2 = Wingham | first2 = D.| title = Recent Sea-Level Contributions of the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets| journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]| volume = 315| issue = 5818| pages = 1529–1532| date = 2007| pmid = 17363663|bibcode = 2007Sci...315.1529S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RignotBamber2008"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1038/ngeo102| last1 = Rignot | first1 = E.| last2 = Bamber | first2 = J.L.| last3 = Van Den Broeke | first3 = M R.| last4 = Davis | first4 = C.| last5 = Li | first5 = Y.| last6 = Van De Berg | first6 = W.J.| last7 = Van Meijgaard | first7 = E.| date = 2008| title = Recent Antarctic ice mass loss from radar interferometry and regional climate modelling| journal = [[Nature Geoscience]]| volume = 1| issue = 2| pages = 106| url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232802727_Recent_Antarctic_ice_mass_loss_from_radar_interferometry_and_regional_climate_modelling|bibcode = 2008NatGe...1..106R | pmc = 4032514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shepherdetal2012"&gt;Sheperd et al. 2012 [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/338/6111/1183 A Reconciled Estimate of Ice-Sheet Mass Balance]&lt;/ref&gt; However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.&lt;ref name="RignotBamber2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChenWilson2008"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2007.10.057| last1 = Chen | first1 = J.L.| last2 = Wilson | first2 = C.R.| last3 = Tapley | first3 = B.D.| last4 = Blankenship | first4 = D.| last5 = Young | first5 = D.| date = 2008| title = Antarctic regional ice loss rates from GRACE| journal = Earth and Planetary Science Letters| volume = 266| issue = 1–2| pages = 140–148|bibcode = 2008E&amp;PSL.266..140C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at &gt;0.05&amp;nbsp;°C (0.09&amp;nbsp;°F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1&amp;nbsp;°C (0.2&amp;nbsp;°F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring.

[[File:NASA and NOAA Announce Ozone Hole is a Double Record Breaker.png|thumb|Image of the largest Antarctic [[ozone hole]] ever recorded due to [[chlorofluorocarbon|CFCs]] accumulation (September 2006)]]
{{Main|Ozone depletion}}

There is a large area of low ozone concentration or "[[ozone hole]]" over Antarctica. This hole covers almost the whole continent and was at its largest in September 2008, when the longest lasting hole on record remained until the end of December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antarctic Ozone|authors=British Antarctic Survey, Meteorology and Ozone Monitoring Unit |publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/ozone/index.html|accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hole was detected by scientists in 1985&lt;ref name="schiermeier2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Atmospheric science: Fixing the sky|author=Schiermeier, Quirin|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090812/full/460792a.html|journal=Nature|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|doi=10.1038/460792a|date=12 August 2009|volume=460|pages=792–795|accessdate=7 October 2009|issue=7257|pmid=19675624}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has tended to increase over the years of observation. The ozone hole is attributed to the [[Atmospheric emissions|emission]] of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s or CFCs into the atmosphere, which decompose the [[ozone]] into other gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.nasa.gov/About/Education/Ozone/antarctic.html |title=The Antarctic Ozone hole |authors=National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Advanced Supercomputing Division (NAS) |publisher=Government of the United States |date=26 June 2001 |accessdate=7 February 2009 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090403024238/http://www.nas.nasa.gov/About/Education/Ozone/antarctic.html |archivedate= 3 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientific studies suggest that ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere).&lt;ref name="schiermeier2009"/&gt; Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the [[stratosphere]]. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6&amp;nbsp;°C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the [[polar vortex]]) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting.&lt;ref name="schiermeier2009"/&gt; Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Turner J.|author2=Comiso J.C.|author3=Marshall G.J.|author4=Lachlan-Cope T.A.|author5=Bracegirdle T.|author6=Maksym T.|author7=Meredith M.P., Wang Z.|author8= Orr A.|title=Non-annular atmospheric circulation change induced by stratospheric ozone depletion and its role in the recent increase of Antarctic sea ice extent|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|volume=36|pages=L08502|date=2009|doi=10.1029/2009GL037524|bibcode=2009GeoRL..36.8502T|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Brazil]] on 6 January 1963. Voters were asked whether they approved of a constitutional amendment made in 1961 that transferred many of the President's powers to the National Congress. The changes were rejected by over 80% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=br011963 Brazil, 6 January 1963: Parliamentary system] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Following the resignation of [[Jânio Quadros]] on 25 August 1961 and the resistance of the [[Brazilian Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] and the [[upper class]]es to allowing [[left-wing]] Vice-President [[João Goulart]] to take office, a serious crisis developed, which almost resulted in a civil war. Goulart, who had been on an official visit to the [[People's Republic of China]], was forbidden to return to the country.

Due to Goulart's massive popular support, rather than removing Goulart from office, the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] proposed an amendment to the 1946 Constitution, changing the form of government from [[presidentialism]] to [[Parliamentary system|parliamentarianism]], reducing the powers of the President and creating a new post of [[Prime Minister of Brazil|Prime Minister]]. The amendment was approved and the military suspended their veto over Goulart, who took office on [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|Independence Day]] in 1961.

However, the system of government, which had been based on the [[Germany|German]] model, did not work well, due to the hurry in which the amendment was approved. The ambitions of Goulart and his rivals [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] and [[Carlos Lacerda]], both of whom were seeking to become President in the forthcoming 1965 elections, also contributed to the failure of parliamentarianism.

In less than two years, there were three Prime Ministers; [[Tancredo Neves]] (1961–1962), [[Brochado da Rocha]] (July–September 1962) and [[Hermes Lima]] (1962–1963).

==Result==
Voters were asked "Do you approve the amendment that established parliamentarism?" ("Aprova o ato adicional que instituiu o parlamentarismo?").

Goulart, having achieved full presidential powers, started his [[João Goulart#Basic reforms|Basic Reforms]] plan (Reformas de Base), which led to a [[Brazilian military coup of 1964|military coup d'état]] in April 1964.

'''Carl Prinzler''' was the Manager of the Builders Hardware Department at the '''[[Vonnegut Hardware Company]]''' in 1903.  Prinzler, along with his architect and engineer neighbor [[Henry H. DuPont]], developed the first "[[panic bar]]" device for doors which can be opened from the inside despite being locked on the outside.  This idea and subsequently an invention came about as a result of the [[Iroquois Theater Fire]].  Prinzler devoted himself to the invention to ensure another tragedy such as this never happened again.

The panic bar was marketed under the [[Von Duprin]] name.  Von Duprin is a company which makes security related products and nowadays belongs to '''[[Allegion]]'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3028">The '''Central Liquidity Facility''' ('''CLF''') is a mixed-ownership United States (U.S.) government corporation created to improve the general financial stability of credit unions by serving as a [[liquidity]] lender to [[credit union]]s experiencing unusual or unexpected liquidity shortfalls. Member credit unions own the CLF which exists within the [[National Credit Union Administration]] (NCUA). The President of the CLF manages the facility under the oversight of the NCUA Board.&lt;ref name="urlNational Credit Union Administration - Central Liquidity Facility"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncua.gov/CLF/index.htm |title=National Credit Union Administration - Central Liquidity Facility |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514202022/http://www.ncua.gov/CLF/index.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2008 |quote= |accessdate=2008-09-05 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Central Liquidity Facility was created by the U.S. Congress in 1998 with the National Credit Union Central Liquidity Facility Act, Subchapter III of the [[Federal Credit Union Act]]. The primary purpose of the CLF is to provide loans to credit unions to meet short or long term liquidity needs. It performs the same general functions for credit unions that the [[Federal Reserve System]] performs for member banks.&lt;ref name="Title III—Central Liquidity Facility"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncua.gov/CLF/fcuact-clf.pdf |title=Title III—Central Liquidity Facility |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607011156/http://www.ncua.gov/CLF/fcuact-clf.pdf |archivedate=June 7, 2007 |quote= |accessdate=2008-09-05 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Central Liquidity Facility is backed by the credit of the U.S. government. The CLF may borrow up to 12 times its subscribed capital stock and surplus (12 USC 1795f(a)(4)(A)).

CLF is organized into five regional branches to serve different states. To become a member, credit unions purchase stock in the Central Liquidity Facility, at an amount equal to 1/2 of 1% of an average of six months of their unimpaired capital and surplus or $50 (whichever is greater).

The Central Liquidity Facility is a [[501(c)(1) organization]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/501 Section 501(l)]". ''Internal Revenue Code''. Legal Information Institute. Cornell University Law School. Retrieved June 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Colorado Mounted Rangers''' (CMR), also historically known as the '''Colorado Rangers''', are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and former statutory state law enforcement auxiliary that assisted law enforcement and other first responder agencies across Colorado. In July 2018, the Colorado Mounted Rangers ceased their operational activities, transitioning those roles to the newly formed [[Colorado Rangers|Colorado Rangers Law Enforcement Shared Reserve]], a government agency. CMR rangers annually provided more than 50,000 volunteer hours to the State of Colorado supporting local police and sheriffs departments by providing additional peace officer resources in times of need.  Rangers were unpaid and the Auxiliary was not funded by tax dollars.  The Colorado Rangers are the oldest statewide [[law enforcement]] organization in [[Colorado]], originally organized in 1861 by the [[Colorado Territory]].

==Law Enforcement Auxiliary per C.R.S § 24-33.5-822==
[[File:Rangers working alongside local Police Department.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.55|Rangers working alongside local Police Department]]
In 2012, thanks to a non-partisan effort by the Colorado General Assembly, Governor [[John Hickenlooper]] signed Senate Bill 12-072 [https://archive.is/20130624214225/http://www.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/olls/sl2012a/sl_57.htm (Link)]  into law, formally recognizing the Ranger's role as a Law Enforcement Auxiliary in the Colorado State Statutes.

"Therefore, the general assembly declares that the Colorado Mounted Rangers should be established as an all-volunteer, unpaid auxiliary unit for the purpose of lending assistance to...law enforcement agencies in the state." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/olls/sl2012a/sl_57.htm SB12-072] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130624214225/http://www.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/olls/sl2012a/sl_57.htm |date=2013-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 24-32-2222 in Senate Bill 12-072 was then harmonized with House Bill 12-1283 and relocated to section 24-33.5-822 placing the Rangers under the Department of Public Safety in 24-33.5 C.R.S.

While the Rangers had been operating under formal memoranda of understanding (MOU's) with agencies across the State, this legislation formalized the Colorado Mounted Rangers' role as the State Law Enforcement Auxiliary and clarified it in the Colorado Revised Statutes.

At their peak, the Colorado Mounted Rangers had a memorandum of understanding with the [[Colorado Department of Public Safety|Colorado Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhsem.state.co.us/emergency-management/operations/resource-mobilization/leave-job-protection-volunteer-workers Colorado Division Of Homeland Security and Emergency Management]&lt;/ref&gt; and partnered with dozens of law enforcement and other government agencies including State, County and local agencies.

==Recognition==
[[File:Ranger Honor Guard.jpg|thumb|left|Ranger Honor Guard standing watch at the Colorado Law Enforcement Memorial on the grounds of the Colorado State Patrol Academy]]

In 1999, fallen Ranger Edward P. Bell's name was enshrined on the Colorado Law Enforcement Memorial which is located on the grounds of the Colorado State Patrol Academy in Golden, Colorado.  Ranger Bell is the only Ranger in the over 150-year history of the Rangers to have been killed in the line of duty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite/StatePatrol-Main/CBON/1251593829577 Colorado Law Enforcement Memorial]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odmp.org/officer/20444-colorado-ranger-edward-bell Officer Down Memorial Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the Colorado General Assembly's [[Colorado House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] passed House Resolution 01-1009 to recognize and honor the Colorado Mounted Rangers service to the Citizens of Colorado since the days of the Colorado Territory.

In 2002, the [[Colorado Senate|Colorado State Senate]] passed Senate Resolution 02-008 that recognized the long-standing tradition of honorable service that the Colorado Mounted Rangers have provided since 1861.

In 2004, [[Bill Owens (Colorado politician)|Governor Bill Owens]] declared Feb. 21, 2004, "Colorado Mounted Ranger Day" honoring Rangers continuing contributions.  Governor Owens also acknowledged the Rangers one time role as the "Governor's Guard".

In 2011, fallen Ranger Edward P. Bell's name was enshrined at the [[National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] during [[National Police Week]].  Rangers made the journey to Washington D.C. to participate in the ceremonies honoring fallen officers from across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nleomf.org/officers/search/search-results/edward-p-bell.html National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, United States Senator [[Michael Bennet]] recognized the Rangers 150 years of service to the citizens of Colorado.  Senator Bennett thanked the Rangers for answering the call to public service.

[[Image:Cowardly lion2.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Cowardly Lion]], from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'']]
'''Cowardice''' is a trait wherein [[fear]] and excessive self-concern override doing or saying what is right, good, and of help to others or oneself in a time of need—it is the opposite of [[courage]]. As a label, "cowardice"  indicates a failure of character in the face of a challenge. One who succumbs to cowardice is known as a coward.&lt;ref&gt; Dictionary.com [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cowardice cowardice]:  "[the] lack of courage to face danger, difficulty, opposition, pain, etc."&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[military law|military codes of justice]] proscribe cowardice in [[combat]] as a crime punishable by [[death]] (note the phrase "[[Execution by firing squad|shot at dawn]]").

As the opposite of an action or trait that many existing and formerly extant cultures [[Cultural norm|demand]], cowardice rates as a character flaw that many societies and their representatives stigmatize and/or punish.

==Etymology==
According to the ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'', the word ''coward'' came into English from the [[Old French]] word ''coart'' (modern French [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/couard ''couard'']), which is a combination of the word for "tail" (Modern French ''queue'', [[Latin]] ''cauda'') and an [[agent (grammar)|agent]] [[noun]] [[suffix]]. It would therefore have meant "one with a tail", which may conjur an image of an animal displaying its tail in flight of fear ("turning tail"), or a [[dog]]'s habit of putting its tail between its legs when it is afraid. Like many other English words of French origin, this word was introduced in the English language by the French-speaking [[Normans]], after the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.uml.edu/jgarreau/FromFrenchtoEnglish.htm From French to English:]. Faculty.uml.edu. Retrieved on 16 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English language|English]] [[surname]] Coward (as in [[Noël Coward]]), however, has the same origin and meaning as the word "cowherd".

==Military law==
Acts of cowardice have long been punishable by military law, which defines a wide range of cowardly offenses, including [[desertion]] in face of the enemy and surrendering to the enemy against orders. The punishment for such acts is typically severe, ranging from [[corporal punishment]] to the [[Capital punishment|death sentence]]. Cowardly conduct is specifically mentioned within the [[United States]] [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], in Article 99.

Generally, cowardice was punishable by execution during [[World War I]], and those who were caught were often court-martialed and, in many cases, [[executed by firing squad]]. British men executed for cowardice were often not commemorated on war memorials, and their families often did not receive benefits and had to endure social stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Executed WW1 soldiers to be given pardons|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/aug/16/military.immigrationpolicy|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Call to rethink cases of French WWI 'coward' soldiers|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24356041|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many decades later, those soldiers all received posthumous pardons in the [[Armed Forces Act 2006#Pardon|Armed Forces Act 2006]] and have been commemorated with the [[Shot at Dawn Memorial]]. Unlike British, French, German, and Soviet/Russian forces, the United States forces tried soldiers for cowardice but never followed through with execution while German commanders were less inclined to use execution as a form of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=World War I Almanac|first=David R. |last=Woodward|page=28|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable controversy was generated by military historian [[S.L.A. Marshall]], who claimed that 75% of U.S. combat troops in World War II never fired at the enemy for the purpose of killing, even while under direct threat.  [[Dave Grossman (author)|Author Dave Grossman]] attempted to explain these findings in his book ''[[On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society ]]''. Marshall's findings were later challenged as mistaken or even fabricated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Robert Engen |url=http://www.journal.dnd.ca/vo9/no2/16-engen-eng.asp |title= Killing for Their Country: A New Look At "Killology" (Canadian Military Journal, Vol. 9, No. 2) |accessdate= 2011-05-08 |quote= As a military historian, I am instinctively skeptical of any work or theory that claims to overturn all existing scholarship – indeed, overturn an entire academic discipline – in one fell swoop...[however] Lieutenant Colonel Grossman’s appeals to biology and psychology are flawed, and that the bulwark of his historical evidence – S.L.A.

The '''dark''' (or '''hidden''') '''figure of crime''' is a term employed by [[Criminology|criminologists]] and [[Sociology|sociologists]] to describe the amount of unreported or undiscovered crime.&lt;ref name="walsh"&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to Criminology: A Text/Reader | publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. | last1=Walsh | first1=Anthony | last2=Hemmens | first2=Craig | year=2014 | location=Thousand Oaks, CA | isbn=978-1-4522-5820-1 | edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
This gap between reported and unreported crimes calls the [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of official [[crime statistics]] into question, but all measures of crime have a dark figure to some degree. The gap in official statistics is largest for less serious crimes.&lt;ref name="walsh" /&gt;

Comparisons between official statistics, such as the [[Uniform Crime Reports]] and the [[National Incident Based Reporting System]], and [[Victim study|victim studies]], such as the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] (NCVS), attempt to provide an insight into the amount of unreported crime.&lt;ref name="maxfield"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Comparing Self-Reports and Official Records of Arrests | journal=Journal of Quantitative Criminology | year=2000 | volume=16 | issue=1 | pages=87–110 | last1=Maxfield | first1=Michael G. | last2=Weiler | first2=Barbara Luntz | last3=Widom | first3=Cathy Spatz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biderman"&gt;{{cite book | title=Understanding Crime Incidence Statistics: Why the UCR Diverges from the NCS | publisher=Springer | year=1991 | location=New York, NY | last1=Biderman | first1=Albert D. | last2=Lynch | first2=James P. | last3=Peterson | first3=James L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Self-report study|Self-report studies]] are also used in comparison with official statistics to assess the dark figure of crime.&lt;ref name="walsh" /&gt;

To eSign a document, one has to have an Aadhaar card and a mobile number registered with Aadhaar. With these two things, an Indian citizen can sign a document remotely without being physically present.

==Procedure==
The notification&lt;ref name=Gazette/&gt; issued by [[Government of India]] in this regard stipulates the following procedure for the e-authentication using Aadhaar e-KYC services.

Authentication of an electronic record by [[e-authentication]]  technique  which shall be done by 
#the applicable use of e-authentication, [[hash function]], and [[asymmetric cryptosystem]] techniques, leading to issuance of [[digital signature]] certificate by Certifying Authority,  
#a [[trusted third party]]  service  by subscriber's key pair generation, storing of the key  pairs  on  hardware  security  module and creation  of  digital  signature provided  that  the  trusted  third  party  shall  be  offered  by  the  certifying authority (the  trusted  third  party  shall  send  application  form  and  certificate signing  request  to  the  Certifying  Authority  for  issuing  a digital  signature certificate to the subscriber),
#issuance  of  digital  signature  certificate  by  Certifying  Authority  shall  be based on e-authentication, particulars given in the prescribed format,  digitally signed  verified  information  from  Aadhaar  e-KYC  services  and  electronic consent of digital signature certificate applicant,
#the  manner  and  requirements  for  e-authentication  shall  be  as  issued  by  the Controller  from time to time,
#the  security  procedure  for  creating  the      subscriber’s  key  pair  shall  be  in accordance with the e-authentication guidelines issued by the Controller, 
#the   standards   referred   to   in   rule   6   of      the   Information   Technology (Certifying Authorities) Rules, 2000 shall be complied with, in so far as they relate   to   the   certification   function   of   public   key of   Digital   Signature Certificate applicant, and
#the  manner  in  which  information  is  authenticated  by  means  of  digital signature      shall  comply  with  the  standards  specified  in  rule  6  of  the Information  Technology  (Certifying  Authorities)  Rules,  2000  in  so  far  as they  relate  to  the  creation,  storage  and  transmission  of  Digital  Signature.
	
==eSign Service Providers==
Organisations and individuals seeking to obtain the eSigning Service can utilize the services of various service providers. There are empanelled service providers with whom organisations can register as an Application Service Prover after submitting the requisite documents, getting UAT access, building the application around the service and going through an IT Audit by an CERT-IN empanelled auditor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Empanelled eSign Service Providers|url=http://www.cca.gov.in/cca/?q=service-providers.html|publisher=Controller of Certifying Authorities, Govt. of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the process of registering as an Application Service Provider is cumbersome, and requires huge investments of time, money and resources in complying with the regulations and building a suitable application. Most organisations prefer using services of plug-n-play gateway providers who take the responsibility of complying with the regulations, hence simplifying the process for the market.

{{Property law}}
An '''estate''', in [[common law]], is the [[net worth]] of a person at any point in time alive or dead. It is the sum of a person's [[assets]] &amp;ndash; legal rights, interests and entitlements to [[property]] of any kind &amp;ndash; less all [[liability (accounting)|liabilities]] at that time. The issue is of special legal significance on a question of [[bankruptcy]] and death of the person. (See [[inheritance]].)

Depending on the particular context, the term is also used in reference to an [[estate in land]] or of a particular kind of property (such as [[real property|real estate]] or [[personal property|personal estate]]). The term is also used to refer to the sum of a person's assets only.

The equivalent in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal systems is [[Family patrimony|patrimony]].

==Bankruptcy==
Under [[bankruptcy in the United States|United States bankruptcy law]], a person's estate consists of all assets or property of any kind available for distribution to creditors.&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Code {{usc|11|541}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some assets are recognized as [[Exempt property|exempt]] to allow a person significant resources to restart his or her financial life. In the [[United States]], asset exemptions depend on various factors, including state and federal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fay|first1=Scott|last2=Hurst|first2=Erik|last3=White|first3=Michele J.|title=The Household Bankruptcy Decision|journal=The American Economic Review|date=June 2002|volume=92|issue=3|jstor=3083362}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 7 - Bankruptcy Basics|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-7-bankruptcy-basics|website=United States Courts|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code § 522 - Exemptions|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/522|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estate (or assets) of a bankrupt person is administered by a [[trustee in bankruptcy]].  The legal position in all [[common law]] countries is similar in this respect.

==Legal estate in land==
{{main|Estate in land}}
In [[land law]], the term "estate" is a remnant of the English [[feudal system]], which created a complex hierarchy of estates and interests in land. The [[allodial]] or [[fee simple]] interest is the most complete ownership that one can have of property in the common law system. An estate can be an estate for years, an estate at will, a [[life estate]] (extinguishing at the death of the holder), an estate ''pur auter vie'' (a life interest for the life of another person) or a [[fee tail]] estate (to the heirs of one's body) or some more limited kind of heir (e.g. to heirs male of one's body).

Fee simple estates may be either [[fee simple absolute]] or [[defeasible estate|defeasible]] (''i.e. subject to future conditions'') like fee simple determinable and fee simple subject to condition subsequent; this is the complex system of [[future interests]] (q.v.) which allows concepts of trusts and estates to elide into [[actuarial science]] through the use of life contingencies.

Estate in land can also be divided into estates of [[inheritance]] and other estates that are not of inheritance.  The fee simple estate and the fee tail estate are estates of inheritance; they pass to the owner's heirs [[Operation of law|by operation of law]], either without restrictions (in the case of fee simple), or with restrictions (in the case of fee tail).  The estate for years and the life estate are estates not of inheritance; the owner owns nothing after the term of years has passed, and cannot pass on anything to his or her heirs.

Legal estates and interests are called rights "in rem", and said to be "good against the world".

==Equitable estates==
Superimposed on the legal estate and interests in land, English courts also created "[[equitable interest]]s" over the same legal interests. These obligations are called [[Trust law|trust]]s which will be enforceable in a [[court]]. A [[trustee]] is the person who holds the [[legal title]] to property, while the [[beneficiary]] is said to have an equitable interest in the property.

The '''Eurasian Patent Organization''' ('''EAPO''') is a regional [[organization]] set up in 1995 by the [[Eurasian Patent Convention]] (EAPC). Its task is to grant Eurasian patents. The official language of the EAPO is [[Russian language|Russian]] and its current president is [[Alexander Grigoriev (patent)|Alexander Grigoriev]].

== Member states ==
There are 8 member states: [[Turkmenistan]], the [[Republic of Belarus]], the [[Republic of Tajikistan]], [[Russia]], the [[Azerbaijan Republic]], the [[Republic of Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Armenia]]. The [[Republic of Moldova]] is a former member state. On 26 October 2011, the Republic of Moldova [[Denunciation (international law)|denounced]] the Eurasian Patent Convention, meaning that, since 26 April 2012, it is no longer party to the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2012/pct_news_2012_01.pdf Denunciation of the Eurasian Patent Convention by the Republic of Moldova], [[PCT Newsletter]], No. 01/2012 (January 2012), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, in December 2011, negotiations on a "validation and co-operation agreement" between the [[European Patent Office]] (EPO) and the Republic of Moldova were authorized by the [[Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.epo.org/epo/pubs/oj012/01_12/01_0042.pdf Report on the 130th meeting of the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation (14 and 15 December 2011)], Official Journal EPO 1/2012, pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}
'''Extradition''' is an act where one jurisdiction delivers a person accused or convicted of committing a crime in another jurisdiction, over to their law enforcement. It is a cooperative law enforcement process between the two jurisdictions and depends on the arrangements made between them. Besides the legal aspects of the process, extradition also involves the physical transfer of custody of the person being extradited to the legal authority of the requesting jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Bringing_International_Fugitives_to_Just.html?id=iSvUjwEACAAJ|title=Bringing International Fugitives to Justice: Extradition and its Alternatives|last=Sadoff|first=David A.|date=2016-12-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107129283|location=|pages=43|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the extradition process, one sovereign jurisdiction typically makes a formal request to another sovereign jurisdiction ("the requested state"). If the fugitive is found within the territory of the requested state, then the requested state may arrest the fugitive and subject him or her to its extradition process.&lt;ref name = "Stigall" /&gt; The extradition procedures to which the fugitive will be subjected are dependent on the law and practice of the requested state.&lt;ref name = "Stigall" /&gt;

Between countries, extradition is normally regulated by [[Treaty|treaties]]. Where extradition is compelled by laws, such as among sub-national jurisdictions, the concept may be known more generally as [[Rendition (law)|rendition]]. It is an ancient mechanism, dating back to at least the 13th century BC, when an Egyptian [[Pharaoh]], [[Ramesses II]], negotiated an extradition treaty with [[Hittite King]], [[Hattusili III]].&lt;ref name="Stigall"&gt;Dan E. Stigall, {{cite web|title=Ungoverned Spaces, Transnational Crime, and the Prohibition on Extraterritorial Enforcement Jurisdiction in International Law|ssrn=2211219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extradition treaties or agreements==
The consensus in [[international law]] is that a [[Sovereign state|state]] does not have any obligation to surrender an alleged criminal to a foreign state, because one principle of [[sovereignty]] is that every state has legal authority over the people within its borders. Such absence of international obligation, and the desire for the right to demand such criminals from other countries, have caused a web of extradition [[treaty|treaties]] or agreements to evolve. When no applicable extradition agreement is in place, a sovereign may still request the expulsion or lawful return of an individual pursuant to the requested state’s domestic law.&lt;ref name = "Stigall" /&gt; This can be accomplished through the immigration laws of the requested state or other facets of the requested state’s domestic law. Similarly, the codes of penal procedure in many countries contain provisions allowing for extradition to take place in the absence of an extradition agreement.&lt;ref name = "Stigall" /&gt; Sovereigns may, therefore, still request the expulsion or lawful return of a fugitive from the territory of a requested state in the absence of an extradition treaty.&lt;ref name = "Stigall" /&gt;

No country in the world has an extradition treaty with all other countries; for example, the [[United States]] lacks extradition treaties with [[China]], the [[Russian Federation]], [[Namibia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[North Korea]], [[Bahrain]], and many other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/71600.pdf Extradition Treaties Interpretation Act of 1998] from the [[United States Department of State]], [https://www.state.gov/s/l/treaty/faqs/70138.htm Extradition Treaties]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RT: Russia Extraditon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Putin: Snowden still in Moscow airport, won't be extradited, free to go anywhere|url=http://rt.com/news/putin-snowden-moscow-extradition-220/|publisher=RT|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Extradition law in the United States]].)

==Bars to extradition==
By enacting laws or in concluding treaties or agreements, countries determine the conditions under which they may entertain or deny extradition requests. Observing fundamental human rights is also an important reason for denying some extradition requests. It is common for human rights exceptions to be specifically incorporated in bilateral treaties.&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AIAdminLawF/2014/3.html |author=Johnston, P |title=The Incorporation of Human Rights Fair Trial Standards into Australian Extradition Law}} (2014) 76 Australian Institute of Administrative Law Forum 20.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}} Such bars can be invoked in relation to the treatment of the individual in the receiving country, including their trial and sentence. These bars may also extend to take account of the effect on family of the individual if extradition proceeds. Therefore, human rights recognised by international and regional agreements may be the basis for denying extradition requests. However, cases where extradition is denied should be treated as  independent exceptions and will only occur in exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref name="Radu"&gt;Mariana (Mitra) Radu, Cătălina Mititelu (2013) “The Observance of Human Rights and Freedoms in the Extradition Proceedings at National and International Levels” JDSR 3, 100 at 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Common bars to extradition include:

===Failure to fulfill [[dual criminality]]===
Generally the act for which extradition is sought must constitute a crime punishable by some minimum penalty in both the requesting and the requested states.

===Political nature of the alleged crime===
Many countries refuse to extradite suspects of [[political prisoners|political crimes]]. See [[political offence exception]].

===Possibility of certain forms of punishment===
Some countries refuse extradition on grounds that the person, if extradited, may receive capital punishment or face torture. A few go as far as to cover all punishments that they themselves would not administer.
* '''Death penalty''': Many jurisdictions, such as [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ea1988149|Extradition Act 1988|15B}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macao]],&lt;ref&gt;Article 7 of Macau Law No. 6/2006 Law of judicial cooperation in criminal matters ({{pt icon}} [http://bo.io.gov.mo/bo/i/2006/30/lei06.asp Lei n.º 6/2006], {{zh|t=[http://bo.io.gov.mo/bo/i/2006/30/lei06_cn.asp 第6/2006號法律]}})&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref&gt;Section 30(3)(a) of the Extradition Act 1999. Also section 48(1)(b)(ii) of the Extradition Act 1999, although this section only applies to extraditions from New Zealand to Australia or the UK, neither of which have the death penalty.&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Africa]], and most [[Europe]]an nations except [[Belarus]], will not allow extradition if the [[death penalty]] may be imposed on the suspect unless they are assured that the death sentence will not be passed or carried out. The [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] considered the case of Joseph Kindler, following the Canadian Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Kindler v Canada (Minister of Justice)|Kindler v Canada]]'' to extradite ''Kindler'' who faced the death penalty in the United States. This decision was given despite the fact that it was expressly provided in the extradition treaty between these two states that extradition may be refused, unless assurances were given that the death penalty shall not be imposed or executed, as well as arguably being a violation of the individual's rights under the Canadian Charter of Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;''Kindler v. Canada'', CCPR/C/48/D/470/1991, UN Commission on Human Rights, 11 November 1993, at 2.2 [http://www.refworld.org/cases,UNCHR,51b6e4fc4.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The decision by the Committee considered Article 6 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], the “inherent right to life” and whether this right prohibited Canada from extraditing the individual to the United States where he faced the death penalty. The Committee decided that there was nothing contained in the terms of Article 6 which required Canada to seek assurance that the individual would not face the death penalty if extradited.&lt;ref&gt;Kindler v. Canada, CCPR/C/48/D/470/1991, UN Commission on Human Rights, 11 November 1993, at 14.6 [http://www.refworld.org/cases,UNCHR,51b6e4fc4.html]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Committee noted that if Canada had extradited without due process it would have breached its obligation under the Convention in this case.
* '''Torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment''': Many countries will not extradite if there is a risk that a requested person will be subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In regard to torture the [[European Court of Human Rights]] has in the past not accepted assurances that torture will not occur when given by a state where torture is systematic or endemic.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;Edward Fitzgerald (2013). Recent Human Rights Developments in Extradition Law &amp; Related Immigration Law, The Denning Law Journal 25 89 at 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Although in the more recent case before the same court ''[[Othman (Abu Qatada) v. United Kingdom]]'' the court retreated from this firm refusal and instead took a more subjective approach for assessing state assurances. Unlike capital punishment it is often more difficult to prove the existence of torture within a state and considerations often depend on the assessment of quality and validity of assurances given by the requesting state.  In the deportation case of ''Othman (Abu Qatada)'' the court provided 11 factors the court will assess in determining the validity of these assurances.&lt;ref&gt;Othman (Abu Qatada) v UK [2013] 55 EHRR 1. para 189&lt;/ref&gt; While torture is provided for as a bar to extradition by the European Convention on Human Rights and more universally by the [[Convention Against Torture]], it is also a [[jus cogens]] norm under international law and can therefore be invoked as a bar even if it is not provided for in an extradition agreement.&lt;ref name="Radu" /&gt; In the case of ''[[Soering v United Kingdom]]'', the [[European Court of Human Rights]] held that it would violate Article 3 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] to extradite a person to the United States from the United Kingdom in a capital punishment case. This was due to the harsh conditions on death row and the uncertain timescale within which the sentence would be executed, but not the death penalty sentence itself. The Court in Soering stressed however that the personal circumstances of the individual, including age and mental state (the individual in this case was 18 years old) were relevant in assessing whether their extradition would give rise to a real risk of treatment exceeding the threshold in Article 3.&lt;ref&gt;Soering v. The United Kingdom, 1/1989/161/217 , Council of Europe: European Court of Human Rights, 7 July 1989, [109]. [http://www.refworld.org/cases,ECHR,3ae6b6fec.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jurisdiction===
Jurisdiction over a crime can be invoked to refuse extradition.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=The prosecute/extradite dilemma: Concurrent criminal jurisdiction and global governance
|author=Adam Abelson|url=https://jilp.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/volume-16-1/Abelson.pdf |date=2010-05-19
|quote="The criminal laws of the United States, whether state or federal, ordinarily apply only to conduct within U.S. territory. Sometimes, however, they apply to conduct abroad, from antitrust conspiracies to torture. Where such extraterritorial criminal prescriptive jurisdiction exists under U.S. law, jurisdiction typically exists under the law of another country as well, such as the country where the conduct occurred."}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the fact that the person in question is a nation's own citizen causes that country to have jurisdiction (see next point).

===Own citizens===

These countries often have laws in place that give them jurisdiction over crimes committed abroad by or against citizens. By virtue of such jurisdiction, they prosecute and try citizens accused of crimes committed abroad as if the crime had occurred within the country's borders (see, e.g., [[trial of Xiao Zhen]]).

===Right to private and family life===
In a limited number of cases [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] has been invoked to stop extradition from proceeding. Article 8 states that everyone has the right to the respect of their private and family life. This is achieved by way of balancing the potential harm to private life against the public interest in upholding the extradition arrangement.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald" /&gt; While this article is useful as it provide for a prohibition to extradition, the threshold required to meet this prohibition is high.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald" /&gt; Article 8 does explicitly provide that this right is subject to limits in the interests of national security and public safety, so these limits must be weighed in a balancing of priority against this right. Cases where extradition is sought usually involve serious crimes so while these limits are often justified there have been cases where extradition could not be justified in light of the individual's family life. Cases to date have mostly involved dependant children where the extradition would be counter to the best interests of this child.&lt;ref name ="Fitzgerald" /&gt;  In the case of ''FK v. Polish Judicial Authority'' the court held that it would violate article 8 for a mother of five young children to be extradited amidst charges of minor fraud which were committed number of years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2012-0039-judgment.pdf F-K v Polish Judicial Authority 2012 UKSC 25]&lt;/ref&gt; This case is an example of how the gravity of the crime for which extradition was sought was not proportionate to protecting the interests of the individual's family. However the court in this case noted that even in circumstances where extradition is refused a custodial sentence will be given to comply with the principles of [[international comity]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2012-0039-judgment.pdf F-K v Polish Judicial Authority 2012 UKSC 25 para 132]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast the case of ''HH v Deputy Prosecutor of the Italian Republic, Genoa'' is an example of when the public interest for allowing extradition outweighed the best interests of the children. In this case both parents were being extradited to Italy for serious drug importation crimes.&lt;ref&gt;HH v Deputy Prosecutor of the Italian Republic, Genoa 2012 UKSC 25 para 132.[https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2012-0039-judgment.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Article 8 does not only address the needs of children, but all family members yet the high threshold required to satisfy Article 8 means that the vulnerability of children is the most likely circumstance to meet this threshold. In the case of ''Norris v US (No 2)'' a man sought to argue that if extradited his health would be undermined and it would cause his wife depression.&lt;ref&gt;Norris v US (No 2) [2010] UKSC 9 as discussed in J.R. Spencer Extradition (2013). The European Arrest Warrant and Human Rights, The Cambridge Law Journal 250 at 251.&lt;/ref&gt; This claim was rejected by the Court which stated that a successful claim under Article 8 would require “exceptional” circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Spencer Extradition (2013). The European Arrest Warrant and Human Rights, The Cambridge Law Journal 250 at 251&lt;/ref&gt;

Suicide Risk: Cases where there is risk of the individual committing suicide have also invoked article 8 as the public interest of extraditing must be considered in light of the risk of suicide by the individual if extradited. In the case of ''Jason's v Latvia'' extradition was refused on these grounds, as the crime for which the individual was sought was not enough of a threat to public interest to outweigh the high risk of suicide which had been assessed to exist for the individual if extradited.&lt;ref&gt;Jasons v Latvia  [2004] EWHC 1845.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fair trial standards===
Consideration of the [[right to a fair trial]] is particularly complex in extradition cases. Its complexity arises from the fact that while the court deciding whether to surrender the individual must uphold these rights this same court must also be satisfied that any trial undertaken by the requesting state after extradition is granted also respects these rights. Article 14 of the [[ICCPR]] provides a number of criteria for fair trial standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume%20999/volume-999-i-14668-english.pdf |title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights}} Adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 19 December 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; These standards have been reflected in courts who have shown that subjective considerations should be made in determining whether such trials would be ‘unjust’ or ‘oppressive’ by taking into account factors such as the duration of time since the alleged offences occurred, health of the individual, prison conditions in the requesting state and likelihood of conviction among other considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCAFC|14|2013|litigants=O'Connor v Adamas |parallelcite=(2013) 210 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 364 |pinpoint=[323]-[331] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet exactly how the standards provided for in ICCPR are incorporated or recognised by domestic courts and decision makers is still unclear although it seems that these standards can at a minimum be used to inform the notions of such decision makers.&lt;ref name="Johnston"/&gt;{{rp|35}} If it is found that fair trial standards will not be satisfied in the requesting country this may be a sufficient bar to extradition.

Article 6 of the ECHR also provides for fair trial standards, which must be observed by European countries when making an extradition request.&lt;ref name ="Johnston" /&gt; This court in the ''Othman'' case, whom if extradited would face trial where evidence against him had been obtained by way of torture.&lt;ref&gt;Othman (Abu Qatada) v UK [2013] 55 EHRR 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This was held to be a violation of Article 6 ECHR as it presented a real risk of a ‘flagrant denial of justice’.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald" /&gt; The court in Othman stressed that in order for a breach of Article 6 to occur the trial in the requesting country must constitute a flagrant denial of justice, going beyond merely an unfair trial.&lt;ref&gt;Othman (Abu Qatada) v UK [2013] 55 EHRR 1 para 258-262.&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence obtained by way of torture has been sufficient to satisfy the threshold of a flagrant denial of justice in a number of case. This is in part because torture evidence threatens the “integrity of the trial process and the rule of law itself.”&lt;ref&gt;Rwanda v Brown [2009] EWHC 770 para 264&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights and extradition==
Human rights as a bar to extradition can be invoked in relation to the treatment of the individual in the receiving country, including their trial and sentence as well as the effect on family of the individual if extradition is granted. The repressive nature and the limitations of freedoms imposed on an individual is part of the extradition process and is the reason for these exceptions and the importance that human rights are observed in the extradition process. Therefore, human rights protected by international and regional agreements may be the basis for denying extradition requests, but only as independent exceptions.&lt;ref name="Radu" /&gt; While human rights concerns can add to the complexity of extradition cases it is positive as it adds to the legitimacy and institutionalisation of the extradition system.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Boister, ''An Introduction to Transnational Criminal Law''(OUP, 2012) at 287&lt;/ref&gt;

Determining whether to allow extradition by the requested state is, among other considerations, a balancing exercise between the interests of the requesting state's pursuit of justice over the accused individuals, the requested state's interests in holding dominion over those presently in its territory, and the rights of the extraditable persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|35|1995|litigants=Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) and the Republic of Austria v Kainhofer |parallelcite=(1995) 185 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 528 at [48] per Gummow J |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Extradition raises human rights concerns in determining this balance in relation to the extraditable person. States make provision to recognise these rights both expressing in bilateral treaty agreements and also, potentially by way of state's obligations under the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], of which the  [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] is particularly relevant to extradition.&lt;ref name="Johnston" /&gt; Although regional, the [[European Convention of Human Rights]] has also been invoked as a bar to extradition in a number of cases falling within its jurisdiction and decisions from the [[European Court of Human Rights]] have been a useful source of development in this area.

==''Aut dedere aut judicare''==
{{Main article|Aut dedere aut judicare}}

A concept related to extradition that has significant implications in transnational criminal law is that of ''[[aut dedere aut judicare]]''.&lt;ref name = "Stigall" /&gt; This maxim represents the principle that states must either surrender a criminal within their jurisdiction to a state that wishes to prosecute the criminal or prosecute the offender in its own courts. Many international agreements contain provisions for ''aut dedere aut judicare''. These include all four [[1949 Geneva Conventions]], the [[U.N. Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings]], the [[U.N. Convention Against Corruption]], the [[Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft]], the [[Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]], the [[Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of an Armed Conflict]], and the [[International Convention for the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid]].&lt;ref name = "Stigall" /&gt;

Some contemporary scholars hold the opinion that ''aut dedere aut judicare'' is not an obligation under customary international law but rather “a specific conventional clause relating to specific crimes” and, accordingly, an obligation that only exists when a state has voluntarily assumed the obligation. [[M. Cherif Bassiouni|Cherif Bassiouni]], however, has posited that, at least with regard to international crimes, it is not only a rule of customary international law but a ''[[jus cogens]]'' principle. Professor Michael Kelly, citing Israeli and Austrian judicial decisions, has noted that “there is some supporting anecdotal evidence that judges within national systems are beginning to apply the doctrine on their own”.&lt;ref name = "Stigall" /&gt;

==Controversies==

===International tensions===
[[File:Baltic extration - 1946.jpg|thumb|Swedish extradition of German and Baltic soldiers to the [[Soviet Union]] in January 1946]]
[[File:Miguelrodriguez-extradition.png|thumb|[[Cali Cartel]] boss [[Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela]] extradited from [[Colombia]] to the [[United States]].]]
[[File:Juan Carlos Ramirez Abadia extradition.jpg|thumb|[[Juan Carlos Ramírez Abadía]] being extradited to face charges in the [[United States]].]]
[[File:Viktor Bout Extradited to US.jpg|thumb|[[Viktor Bout]] extradited to the [[United States]] aboard a [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] [[Airplane|plane]].]]

The refusal of a country to extradite suspects or criminals to another may lead to international relations being strained. Often, the country to which extradition is refused will accuse the other country of refusing extradition for political reasons (regardless of whether or not this is justified). A case in point is that of [[Ira Einhorn]], in which some US commentators pressured President [[Jacques Chirac]] of [[France]], who does not intervene in legal cases, to permit extradition when the case was held up due to differences between French and American human rights law. Another long-standing example is [[Roman Polanski]] whose extradition was pursued by [[California]] for over 20 years. For a brief period he was placed under arrest in Switzerland, however subsequent legal appeals there prevented extradition.

The questions involved are often complex when the country from which suspects are to be extradited is a democratic country with a [[rule of law]]. Typically, in such countries, the final decision to extradite lies with the national executive ([[prime minister]], [[president]] or equivalent). However, such countries typically allow extradition defendants recourse to the law, with multiple appeals. These may significantly slow down procedures. On the one hand, this may lead to unwarranted international difficulties, as the public, politicians and journalists from the requesting country will ask their executive to put pressure on the executive of the country from which extradition is to take place, while that executive may not in fact have the authority to deport the suspect or criminal on their own. On the other hand, certain delays, or the unwillingness of the local prosecution authorities to present a good extradition case before the court on behalf of the requesting state, may possibly result from the unwillingness of the country's executive to extradite.

Even though the United States has an extradition treaty with Japan, most extraditions are not successful due to Japan’s domestic laws. In order for the United States to be successful, they must present their case for extradition to the Japanese authorities. However, certain evidence is barred from being in these proceedings such as the use of confessions, searches or electronic surveillance. In most cases involving international drug trafficking, this kind of evidence constitutes the bulk of evidence gathered in the investigation on a suspect for a drug-related charge. Therefore, this usually hinders the United States from moving forward with the extradition of a criminal.&lt;ref&gt;Surena, André M. Grove, Margaret A. Perl, Raphael. Zagaris, Bruce. Blum, Jack A. International Drug Traffic. Proceedings of the Annual Meeting. American Society of International Law. Vol. 84. 28 March 1990. p. 1-12 &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/25658526&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There is at present controversy in the United Kingdom about the [[Extradition Act 2003]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/Files/kfile/USExtradition_210503.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715051153/http://www.fco.gov.uk/Files/kfile/USExtradition_210503.pdf |archivedate=2006-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which dispenses with the need for a ''[[prima facie]]'' case for extradition. This came to a head over the extradition of [[the Natwest Three]] from the UK to the U.S., for their alleged fraudulent conduct related to [[Enron]]. Several British political leaders were heavily critical of the British government's handling of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oliver King and agencies |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foreignaffairs/story/0,,1812471,00.html |title=Lib Dem leader joins bankers' extradition battle |publisher=Politics.guardian.co.uk |date=2006-07-04 |accessdate=2014-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the United States submitted extradition requests to many nations for former National Security Agency employee [[Edward Snowden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usdoj.com/7663/38803/a/usa-requests-provisional-arrest-warrants-from-various-countries-against-edward-s |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628142406/http://usdoj.com/7663/38803/a/usa-requests-provisional-arrest-warrants-from-various-countries-against-edward-s |archivedate=2017-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It criticized Hong Kong for allowing him to leave despite an extradition request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/11/world/nsa-snowden/index.html | work=CNN | title=U.S. criticizes China's handling of Snowden case - CNN.com | date=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abductions===

==="Extraordinary rendition"===
{{Main article|Extraordinary rendition}}
"Extraordinary rendition" is an [[extrajudicial]] procedure in which criminal suspects, generally suspected [[terrorist]]s or supporters of terrorist organisations, are transferred from one country to another.&lt;ref name=MJC-2009-09-08&gt;Michael John Garcia, Legislative Attorney American Law Division. [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL32890.pdf Renditions: Constraints Imposed by Laws on Torture] 8 September 2009; link from the United States [http://www.counterterrorismtraining.gov/leg/index.html Counter-Terrorism Training and Resources for Law Enforcement web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014042245/http://www.counterterrorismtraining.gov/leg/index.html |date=October 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure differs from extradition as the purpose of the rendition is to extract information from suspects, while extradition is used to return fugitives so that they can stand trial or fulfill their sentence. The United States' [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) allegedly operates a global extraordinary rendition programme, which from 2001 to 2005 captured an estimated 150 people and transported them around the world.&lt;ref name="NYT-17-Feb-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA-Background-Memo"&gt;"[https://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/082409/olcremand/2004olc97.pdf Background Paper on CIA's Combined Use of Interrogation Techniques]". 30 December 2004.

Retrieved 29 March 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alleged US programme prompted several official investigations in Europe into alleged [[black site|secret detentions]] and illegal international transfers involving [[Council of Europe]] member states. A [[#27 June 2006 Council of Europe resolution|June 2006 report]] from the Council of Europe estimated 100 people had been kidnapped by the CIA on EU territory (with the cooperation of Council of Europe members), and rendered to other countries, often after having transited through secret detention centres ("[[black site]]s") utillised by the CIA, some of which could be located in Europe. According to the separate [[#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|European Parliament report of February 2007]], the CIA has conducted 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where suspects could face torture, in violation of article 3 of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta06/ERES1507.htm Resolution 1507 (2006).]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612123848/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FAdoptedText%2Fta06%2FERES1507.htm |date=June 12, 2010 }} Alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers of detainees involving Council of Europe member states]&lt;/ref&gt; A large majority of the [[European Union Parliament]] endorsed the report's conclusion that many member states tolerated illegal actions by the CIA, and criticised such actions. Within days of his inauguration, President Obama signed an Executive Order opposing rendition torture and established a task force to provide recommendations about processes to prevent rendition torture.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations/ |title=Ensuring Lawful Interrogations &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=17 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126061153/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations/ |archivedate=26 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3944">'''FitzPatrick 1932''' is an early paper in the field of [[bankruptcy prediction]].  In a series of three articles in the monthly ''The Certified Public Accountant'' in 1932, Paul J. FitzPatrick presented data for 20 matched pairs of firms and discussed accounting ratios as indicators of bankruptcy.  It is historically significant as an early attempt in this field, and it is notable also for its publishing a data set, now in the public domain.  Beaver (1968), an important paper in accounting research which employs statistical analysis to a similar matched sample, cites the paper.

The dataset includes 13 accounting ratios calculated for 40 firms for each of three years.  However some fields are missing for some firm-year observations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4981">{{short description|A confession obtained from a person under duress}}
A '''forced confession''' is a confession obtained from a suspect or a [[prison]]er by means of [[torture]] (including [[enhanced interrogation technique]]s) or other forms of [[duress]]. Depending on the level of coercion used, a forced confession is not valid in revealing the truth. The person being interrogated may agree to the story presented to him or even make up falsehoods himself in order to satisfy the interrogator and discontinue his suffering.&lt;ref name="illum2016-07-08"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boffa|first1=Christa|title=Palazz Castellania|url=http://www.illum.com.mt/ahbarijiet/socjali/42432/palazz_castellania#.V5yZyPl961t|work=Illum|date=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730125955/http://www.illum.com.mt/ahbarijiet/socjali/42432/palazz_castellania|archivedate=30 July 2016|language=Maltese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For centuries the Latin phrase "''Confessio est regina probationum''" (In [[English language|English]]: Confession is the [[Queen of evidence]]) justified the use of forced confession in the European legal system. When especially during the [[Middle Ages]] acquiring a confession was the most important thing during preparations before a trial, than the method used to get the confession seemed irrelevant, [[de facto]] sanctioning the use of torture to extract forced confession. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

By the late 18th century, most scholars and lawyers thought of the forced confession not only as a relic of past times and morally wrong but also ineffective as the victim of torture may confess to anything just to ease their suffering.

Developments in the 20th century, notably the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], greatly reduced the legal acceptance of forced confessions.  However, for most of legal history they have been accepted in most of the world, and are still accepted in some jurisdictions.

==Modern day usage==
Since 2001, as part of its [[War on Terror]] the United States using the [[CIA]] operates a network of off shore prisons, called [[black site]]s, probably the most famous of which is [[Guantánamo Bay detention camp]].
State officials have admitted to the press and in court to be using various torture techniques (authorised by the District attorney) to interrogate suspects of terrorism, sometimes after [[forced disappearance]] or [[extraordinary rendition by the United States]]. 

When these systematic acts were made public by the international media, the [[European Union]], [[United Nations]], the international press and various human rights movements condemned their practice.
The US Supreme Court did not discontinue their usage and repeatedly ruled against hearing citizens that underwent forced confessions, even after they were found innocent, claiming that a trial would constitute a breach of national security.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/safefree/extraordinaryrendition/22201res20051206.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous case is that of [[Khalid El-Masri]]. He appealed several times aided by different international human rights movements and lawyers, yet the US Supreme Court retained its usage of forced confession techniques, and denied a hearing of the evidence.

===Forced televised confessions in China===

The [[People's Republic of China]] systematically employed forced televised confession against [[list of Chinese dissidents|Chinese dissidents]] and workers of various [[human rights group]] in an attempt to discredit, smear and suppress dissident voices and activism, as well as part of the state propaganda. These scripted confessions, obtained via systematic [[duress]] and [[torture]], are broadcast on the [[China Central Television|state television]]. Notable victims includes [[Wang Yu (lawyer)|Wang Yu]], a female [[human rights]] [[lawyer]], and [[Sweden|Swedish]] citizen [[Peter Dahlin]], an [[NGO]] worker and [[human rights activist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/world/asia/china-confession-cctv.html|title=China Uses Foreigners’ Televised Confessions to Serve Its Own Ends|last=Wong|first=Edward|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theinitium.com/article/20180709-opinion-luosiling-peter-dahlin-forced-confession/|title=瑞典人彼得·達林：我在中國上電視認罪，《1984》噩夢成為現實|website=theinitium.com|language=zh-Hant|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/world/asia/china-forced-confessions-propaganda.html|title=How China Uses Forced Confessions as Propaganda Tool|last=Myers|first=Steven Lee|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''generic trademark''', also known as a '''genericized trademark''' or '''proprietary eponym''', is a [[trademark]] or [[brand name]] that, due to its popularity or significance, has become the generic name for, or synonymous with, a general class of [[Good (economics and accounting)|product]] or [[service (economics)|service]], usually against the intentions of the trademark's holder. The process of a product's name becoming genericized is known as genericide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/15-15809/15-15809-2017-05-16.html|title=Elliott v.

A trademark is said to become ''genericized'' when it begins as a distinctive product identifier but changes in meaning to become generic.  This typically happens when the products or services with which the trademark is associated have acquired substantial [[market dominance strategies|market dominance]] or [[mind share]], such that the primary meaning of the genericized trademark becomes the product or service itself rather than an indication of source for the product or service. A trademark thus popularized has its legal protection at risk in some countries such as the United States and United Kingdom, as its [[intellectual property]] rights in the trademark may be lost and competitors enabled to use the genericized trademark to describe their similar products, unless the owner of an affected trademark works sufficiently to correct and prevent such broad use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NowSell.com | work = Marketing Guide |title=Genericized trademark|url=http://www.nowsell.com/marketing-guide/genericized-trademark.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201150056/http://www.nowsell.com/marketing-guide/genericized-trademark.html|archivedate= 1 February 2013 | df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Harvard Law School|title=Overview of Trademark Law | first = William | last = Fisher | date = n.d. |url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tm.htm}} "Under some circumstances, terms that are not originally generic can become generic over time (a process called "genericity"), and thus become unprotected."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Patents 101 |publisher= Hyra IP, PLC|title=How Long Does a Trademark Last? | first = Clifford D. | last = Hyra |url=http://patents101.com/2009/11/how-long-does-a-trademark-last/ | dead-url = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100125000246/http://patents101.com/2009/11/how-long-does-a-trademark-last/| archive-date = 25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In subpopulations ==
Genericization or "loss of secondary meaning" may be either among the general population or among just a subpopulation, for example, people who work in a particular industry. Some examples of the latter type from the vocabulary of physicians include the names [[Luer taper|Luer-Lok (Luer lock)]], [[phoropter|Phoroptor (phoropter)]], and [[Port (medical)|Port-a-Cath (portacath)]], which have genericized [[mind share]] (among physicians) because (1) the users may not realize that the term is a brand name rather than a [[medical eponym]] or generic-etymology term, and (2) no alternative generic name for the idea readily comes to mind. Most often, genericization occurs because of heavy advertising that fails to provide an alternative generic name or that uses the trademark in similar fashion to [[generic term]]s.  Thus, when the [[Otis Elevator Company]] advertised that it offered "the latest in elevator and escalator design," it was using the well-known generic term "elevator" and Otis's trademark "Escalator" for moving staircases in the same way.  The Trademark Office and the courts concluded that, if Otis used their trademark in that generic way, they could not stop Westinghouse from calling its moving staircases "escalators", and a valuable trademark was lost through ''genericization''.

== In pharmaceuticals ==
The pharmaceutical industry affords some protection from genericization of trade names due to the modern practice of assigning a nonproprietary name for a drug based upon chemical structure. Brand-name drugs have well-known [[drug nomenclature|nonproprietary names]] from the beginning of their commercial existence, even while still under patent, preventing the aforementioned problem of "no alternative generic name for the idea readily coming to mind". For example, even when Abilify was new, its nonproprietary name, [[Aripiprazole]], was well documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = NDA 21-436: Letter to Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. | first = Robert | last = Temple | date = November 15, 2002 | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration]], [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] | url = https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2002/21436ltr.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = U.S. Food and Drug Administration Approves ABILIFY® (aripiprazole) as the First Medication for Add-On Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) | date = November 20, 2007 | publisher = Bristol-Myers Squibb Company | url = https://news.bms.com/press-release/us-food-and-drug-administration-approves-abilify-aripiprazole-first-medication-add-tre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Focus on Aripiprazole: A Review of its use in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | first1 = Masa’il | last1 = Greenaway | first2 = Dean | last2 = Elbe | journal = Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | date = August 2009 | volume = 18 | number = 3 | pages = 250–260 | publisher = Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | language = English | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732733/ | pmid = 19718428}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example is [[Warfarin]], which was known as an ingredient in rat poison before it was approved for human use under the brand name of Coumadin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Milestone 2: Warfarin: from rat poison to clinical use | first = Gregory B. | last = Lim | date = 14 December 2017 | journal = Nature Reviews Cardiology | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/nrcardio.2017.172 | doi = 10.1038/nrcardio.2017.172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of genericization before the modern system of [[generic drug]]s include [[aspirin]], introduced to the market in 1897, and [[heroin]], introduced in 1898. Both were originally trademarks of [[Bayer AG]]. However, U.S. court rulings in 1918 and 1921 found the terms to be genericized, stating the company's failure to reinforce the brand's connection with their product as the reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Bayer Co. v. United Drug Co. |vol=272 |reporter=F. |opinion=505 |pinpoint=p.512 |court=S.D.N.Y |date=1921 |url=https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tmcases/bayer.htm |accessdate=2015-09-01 |quote=Disregarding this, however, it was too late in the autumn of 1915 to reclaim the word which had already passed into the public domain. If the consuming public had once learned to know ‘Aspirin’ as the accepted name for the drug, perhaps it is true that an extended course of education might have added to it some proprietary meaning, but it would be very difficult to prove that it had been done in 17 months, and in any case the plaintiff does not try to prove it. [...] Yet, had it not been indifferent to the results of selling to the consumer, it could have protected itself just as well at the time when consumers began to buy directly as in 1915. Nothing would have been easier than to insist that the tablet makers should market the drug in small tin boxes bearing the plaintiff's name, or to take over the sale just as it did later. Instead of this, they allowed the manufacturing chemists to build up this part of the demand without regard to the trade-mark. Having made that bed, they must be content to lie in it. Hence it appears to me that nothing happening between October, 1915, and March, 1917, will serve to turn the word into a trade-mark.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayer's involvement in the [[Great Phenol Plot]] during [[World War I]], and subsequently the U.S. declaration of war on Germany, were also involved in the case of aspirin and heroin.

A different [[word sense|sense]] of the word ''genericized'' in the pharmaceutical industry refers to products whose patent protection has expired. For example, [[Lipitor]] was genericized in the U.S. when the first competing generic version was approved by the FDA in November 2011. In this same context, the term ''genericization'' refers to the process of a brand drug losing market exclusivity to generics.

== Trademark erosion ==
{{Main|List of generic and genericized trademarks}}
'''Trademark erosion''', or '''genericization''', is a special case of [[antonomasia]] related to [[trademark]]s. It happens when a trademark becomes so common that it starts being used as a common name&lt;ref name=Marsden&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/genericide-when-brands-get-too-big-2295428.html | title = 'Genericide': When brands get too big | first = Rhodri | last = Marsden | date = 10 June 2011 | work = The Independent | access-date = 20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.consumerreports.org/consumerist/15-product-trademarks-that-have-become-victims-of-genericization/ | title = 15 Product Trademarks That Have Become Victims Of Genericization | date = 19 July 2014 | work = Consumer Reports | publisher = Consumer Reports | access-date = 20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schofield&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.thelawyersdaily.ca/articles/3444 | title = Sometimes a trademark is too 'successful' | date = 26 January 2017 | first = John | last = Schofield | work = The Lawyer's Daily | publisher = LexisNexis Canada | access-date = 20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''and'' the original company has failed to prevent such use.&lt;ref name=Marsden /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schofield /&gt; Once it has become an appellative, the word cannot be registered any more; this is why companies try hard not to let their trademark become too common, a phenomenon that could otherwise be considered a successful move since it would mean that the company gained an exceptional recognition.

[[Nintendo]] is an example of a brand that successfully fought trademark erosion, having managed to replace excessive use of its name by the then-neologism [[game console]].&lt;ref name=Marsden /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelinguafile.com/2012/11/generic-trademarks.html|title=Generic Trademarks | date = 29 November 2012 |website=The Lingua File|accessdate=29 August 2017 | dead-url = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170830061553/http://www.thelinguafile.com/2012/11/generic-trademarks.html | archive-date = 30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal concepts ==
Whether or not a mark is popularly identified as genericized, the owner of the mark may still be able to enforce the [[Property|proprietary]] rights that attach to the use or registration of the mark, as long as the mark continues to exclusively identify the owner as the commercial origin of the applicable products or services. If the mark does not perform this essential function and it is no longer possible to legally enforce rights in relation to the mark, the mark may have become generic. In many legal systems (e.g., in the [[United States]] but not in [[Germany]]) a generic mark forms part of the [[public domain]] and can be commercially exploited by anyone. Nevertheless, there exists the possibility of a trademark becoming a revocable generic term in German (and European) trademark law.

The process by which trademark rights are diminished or lost as a result of common use in the marketplace is known as ''genericization''. This process typically occurs over a period of time in which a mark is not used as a trademark (i.e., where it is not used to exclusively identify the products or services of a particular business), where a mark falls into disuse entirely, or where the trademark owner does not enforce its rights through [[lawsuit|actions]] for [[passing off (legal term)|passing off]] or [[trademark infringement]].

One risk factor that may lead to genericization is the use of a trademark as a [[verb]], [[plural]] or [[possessive pronoun|possessive]], unless the mark itself is possessive or plural (e.g., "Friendly's" restaurants).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3com.com/corpinfo/en_US/legal/trademark/prop_usage_tmb.html#1 |work=3Com Legal |title=Trademarks and Brands |publisher=3Com Corporation |date= |accessdate=28 March 2010 |dead-url = yes |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090210041955/http://www.3com.com/corpinfo/en_US/legal/trademark/prop_usage_tmb.html |archive-date = 10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in highly inflected languages, a tradename may have to carry case endings in usage. An example is [[Finnish language|Finnish]], where "''[[Microsoft]]in''" is the [[genitive case]] and "''[[Facebook]]ista''" is the [[elative case]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Microsoft Oy |url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/uutisia/archive/2011/11/10/nokia-lumia-800-ensiesittelyss-228-microsoftin-hello-helsinki-tapahtumassa.aspx |title=Nokia Lumia 800 ensiesittelyssä Microsoftin Hello Helsinki! -tapahtumassa | language = Finnish |work = Microsoft TechNet |publisher=Microsoft |date=10 November 2011 |accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Avoiding genericization ===
Generic use of a trademark presents an inherent risk to the effective enforcement of trademark rights and may ultimately lead to genericization.

The legal team of Velcro created a music video highlighting the tragedy of genericide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |author=VELCRO® Brand |title=Don't Say Velcro|date=25 September 2017 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRi8LptvFZY |accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trademark owners may take various steps to reduce the risk, including educating businesses and consumers on appropriate trademark use, avoiding use of their marks in a generic manner, and systematically and effectively enforcing their trademark rights. If a trademark is associated with a new [[invention]], the trademark owner may also consider developing a generic term for the product to be used in descriptive contexts, to avoid inappropriate use of the "house" mark. Such a term is called a ''generic descriptor'', and is frequently used immediately after the trademark to provide a description of the product or service. For example, "Kleenex tissues" ("facial tissues" being the generic descriptor) or "[[Velcro]] brand fasteners" for Velcro brand name hook-and-loop fasteners.

Another common practice among trademark owners is to follow their trademark with the word ''brand'' to help define the word as a trademark. [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] changed the lyrics of their [[Band-Aid]] television commercial jingle from, "I am stuck on Band-Aids, 'cause Band-Aid's stuck on me" to "I am stuck on Band-Aid ''brand'', 'cause Band-Aid's stuck on me."{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} [[Google]] has gone to lengths to prevent this process, discouraging publications from using the term '[[Google (verb)|googling]]' in reference to Web searches. In 2006, both the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;ref name="bbc-google"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3006486.stm |title = Google calls in the 'language police' |first = Jonathan |last = Duffy |work = BBC News |date = 20 June 2003 |publisher = [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |access-date = 20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Merriam Webster|Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary]]&lt;ref name="mw-google"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/google |title=Google |work = Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster, Incorporated]] |access-date = 20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; struck a balance between acknowledging widespread use of the verb coinage and preserving the particular search engine's association with the coinage, defining ''[[google (verb)|google]]'' (all lower case, with -''le'' ending) as a verb meaning "use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet".

Where a trademark is used generically, a trademark owner may need to take aggressive measures to retain [[exclusive right]]s to the trademark. [[Xerox|Xerox corporation]] attempted to prevent the genericization of its core trademark&lt;ref name="xerox-advert"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legalblogwatch.typepad.com/legal_blog_watch/2010/06/xerox-ad-pretends-we-care-about-its-trademark-rights-to-term-xerox.html |title=Xerox Ad Pretends We Care About Its Trademark Rights to Term Xerox |first = Bruce |last = Carton |date = 30 June 2010 |work = Legal Blog Watch |publisher=Law.com |access-date = 20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; through an extensive public relations campaign advising consumers to "[[photocopy]]" instead of "xerox" documents.

One example of an active effort to prevent the genericization of a trademark was that of the [[Lego|Lego Company]], which printed in manuals in the 1970s and 1980s a request to customers that they call the company's interlocking plastic building blocks "'Lego bricks', 'blocks' or 'toys', and not 'Legos'." While this went largely unheeded, and many children and adults in the U.S. referred to and continue to refer to the pieces as "Legos", use of the deprecated term remained largely confined to the Lego Company's own products – and not, for example, to [[Tyco Toys|Tyco]]'s competing and interchangeable product – so genericization of the Lego trademark did not occur.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[Adobe Systems]] is working to prevent the genericization of their trademarks, such as [[Photoshop]], but has had mixed success. This is shown via recurring use of the verb "photoshopped", or the shortened version "shopped", throughout the Internet and mass media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/misc/trade.html |title=General trademark guidelines |work = Adobe |publisher=Adobe Systems Incorporated |date= |accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protected designation of origin ==
Since 2003, the [[European Union]] has actively sought to restrict the use of [[geographical indication]]s by third parties outside the EU by enforcing laws regarding "[[protected designation of origin]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |url=http://ethesis.helsinki.fi/julkaisut/oik/julki/pg/rovamo/monopoli.pdf |format=PDF |title=Monopolising Names? The Protection of Geographical Indications in the European Community | first = Oskari | last = Rovamo | publisher = Faculty of Law, Helsinki University | type = Pro Gradu | date = August 2006 |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a geographical indication for specialty food or drink may be generic, it is not a trademark because it does not serve to identify exclusively a specific commercial enterprise and therefore cannot constitute a genericized trademark.

The extension of protection for geographical indications is somewhat controversial. A geographical indication may have been registered as a trademark elsewhere; for example, if "Parma Ham" was part of a trademark registered in [[Canada]] by a Canadian manufacturer, then ham manufacturers in [[Parma]], [[Italy]], might be unable to use this name in Canada. Wines (such as [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]], [[Port wine|Port]] and [[Champagne wine|Champagne]]), cheeses (such as [[Roquefort cheese|Roquefort]], [[Parmesan]], and [[Feta cheese|Feta]]), [[Pisco]] liquor, and [[Scotch whisky]] are examples of geographical indications. Compare Russian use of "Шампанское" (= Shampanskoye) for [[champagne]]-type wine made in Russia.

In the 1990s, the Parma consortium successfully sued the [[Asda]] [[supermarket]] chain to prevent it using the description "Parma ham" on [[prosciutto]] produced in Parma but sliced outside the Parma region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first1 = Richard | last1 = Owen | first2 = Valerie | last2 = Elliott | title='Barmy' ruling bans Asda from undercutting its Parma ham | date=21 May 2003 | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1134467.ece | work =The Times | pages = | accessdate = 5 October 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Court ruled that pre-packaged ham must be produced, sliced, and packaged in Parma in order to be labeled for sale as "Parma ham".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3043283.stm | title = Asda slams 'ham-fisted' Parma ruling | date = 20 May 2003 | work = BBC News | publisher = [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] | access-date = 20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scale of distinctiveness ==
{{main|Trademark distinctiveness}}
A trademark is said to fall somewhere along a scale from being "[[Trademark distinctiveness|distinctive]]" to "generic" (used primarily as a common name for the product or service rather than an indication of source).  Among distinctive trademarks the scale goes from strong to weak:{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
; "Arbitrary"
: having no meaning as to the nature of the product
; "Fanciful" or "coined"
: original and having little if any reference to the nature of the product or service
; "Suggestive"
: having primarily trademark significance but with suggestion as to the nature of the product
; "Descriptive"
: not just suggesting, but actually describing the product or service yet still understood as indicating source
; "Merely descriptive"
: having almost entirely reference to the product or service but capable of becoming "distinctive".

{{quote|[...] In rabbinic literature the ''ger toshab'' was a Gentile who observed the Noachian commandments but was not considered a convert to Judaism because he did not agree to circumcision.

Some scholars have claimed that the term "those who fear God" (''yir᾿ei Elohim''/''Shamayim'') was used in rabbinic literature to denote Gentiles who were on the fringe of the synagogue.

{{quote|In order to find a precedent the rabbis went so far as to assume that proselytes of this order were recognized in Biblical law, applying to them the term "toshab" ("sojourner," "aborigine," referring to the Canaanites; see Maimonides' explanation in "Yad," Issure Biah, xiv. 7; see Grätz, l.c. p. 15), in connection with "ger" (see Ex. xxv. 47, where the better reading would be "we-toshab"). Another name for one of this class was "proselyte of the gate" ("ger ha-sha'ar," that is, one under Jewish civil jurisdiction; comp. Deut. v. 14, xiv. 21, referring to the stranger who had legal claims upon the generosity and protection of his Jewish neighbors). In order to be recognized as one of these the neophyte had publicly to assume, before three "ḥaberim," or men of authority, the solemn obligation not to worship idols, an obligation which involved the recognition of the seven Noachian injunctions as binding ('Ab. Zarah 64b; "Yad," Issure Biah, xiv. 7).&lt;br&gt;[...] The more rigorous seem to have been inclined to insist upon such converts observing the entire Law, with the exception of the reservations and modifications explicitly made in their behalf. The more lenient were ready to accord them full equality with Jews as soon as they had solemnly forsworn idolatry. The "via media" was taken by those that regarded public adherence to the seven Noachian precepts as the indispensable prerequisite (Gerim iii.; 'Ab. Zarah 64b; Yer. Yeb. 8d; Grätz, l.c. pp. 19–20). The outward sign of this adherence to Judaism was the observance of the Sabbath (Grätz, l.c. pp. 20 et seq.; but comp. Ker. 8b).|last1=Jacobs|first1=Joseph|last2=Hirsch||first2=Emil G.|source="[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12391-proselyte#anchor4 Proselyte]", ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' (1906).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
a set of imperatives which, according to the [[Talmud]], were given by God&lt;ref&gt;According to Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, Entry ''Ben Noah'', page 349), most [[Rishonim|medieval authorities]] consider that all seven commandments were given to [[Adam]], although [[Maimonides]] ([[Mishneh Torah]], Hilkhot M'lakhim 9:1) considers the dietary law to have been given to Noah.&lt;/ref&gt; as a binding set of laws for the "children of [[Noah]]" – that is, all of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, entry ''Ben Noah'', introduction) states that after the giving of the [[Torah]], the Jewish people were no longer in the category of the sons of Noah; however, Maimonides (Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot M'lakhim 9:1) indicates that the seven laws are also part of the Torah, and the Talmud (Bavli, [[Sanhedrin]] 59a, see also Tosafot ad. loc.) states that Jews are obligated in all things that Gentiles are obligated in, albeit with some differences in the details.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare {{bibleverse||Genesis|9:4–6|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''ger toshav'' is therefore commonly deemed a ''righteous gentile'' ({{lang-he-n|חסיד אומות העולם}} ''chassid umot ha-olam'' "Pious People of the World").&lt;ref name="ET1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Talmudit|year=1979|publisher=Yad Harav Herzog (Emet)|location=Jerusalem, Israel|edition=Fourth Printing|editor=Rabbi Shlomo Yosef Zevin|language=Hebrew|chapter=Ger Toshav, Section 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A ''ger toshav'' is a gentile who accepts the authority of the [[Torah]] and the [[rabbi]]s upon himself, but specifically as applied to gentiles. The term ''ger toshav'' may be used in a formal or informal sense.

In the formal sense, a ''ger toshav'' is a gentile who officially accepts the seven [[Noahide Laws]] as binding upon himself in the presence of a ''[[beth din]]'' (Jewish rabbinical court). In the [[Talmud]]ic discussion regarding the ''ger toshav'', there are two other, differing minority opinions (''[[Avodah Zarah]]'', 64b) as to what the ''ger toshav'' accepts upon himself:&lt;ref name="ET1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Talmud b. Sanhedrin 56a, 56b''&lt;/ref&gt;
# To abstain from [[idolatry|idolatrous]] practices of any kind (detailed in {{bibleverse||Exodus|20:2–4|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Deut|5:6–8|HE}}).&lt;ref name="JE"/&gt;
# To uphold all the [[613 Mitzvot|613 commandments]] in rabbinical enumeration,&lt;ref name="JE"/&gt; except for the prohibition against eating kosher animals that died by means other than ritual slaughter, or possibly&lt;ref name="ET1"/&gt; (Meiri) any prohibition not involving ''[[kareth]]''.

The accepted legal definition is the majority opinion that the ''ger toshav'' must accept the seven Noahide Laws before a rabbinical court of three.&lt;ref name="JE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ET1"/&gt; Such a ''ger toshav'' receives certain legal protections and privileges from the community, the rules regarding Jewish-Gentile relations are modified, and there is a Biblical obligation to render him aid when in need. The restrictions on having a gentile do work for a Jew on the Sabbath are also stricter when the gentile is a ''ger toshav''.&lt;ref name="ET"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Talmudit|year=1979|publisher=Yad Harav Herzog (Emet)|location=Jerusalem, Israel|edition=Fourth Printing|editor=Rabbi Shlomo Yosef Zevin|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the informal sense, a ''ger toshav'' is one who accepts the Noahide Laws on his own, or alternatively, simply rejects idolatry.&lt;ref name="JE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ET1"/&gt; (the latter issue is in particular brought up regarding [[Muslim]]s.)&lt;ref name="ET1"/&gt; More formally, a gentile who accepts the Seven Mitzvot, although not before a ''beth din'', is known as ''chasid umot ha'olam'', which means "Pious People of the World."&lt;ref name="SSMH27" /&gt; There is discussion among the halakhic authorities as to which of the rules regarding a ''ger toshav'' would apply to the informal case.&lt;ref name="JE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ET"/&gt;

The procedure has been discontinued since the cessation of the year of [[Jubilee (biblical)|Jubilee]], and hence, there are no formal ''gerim toshvim'' (plural) extant today. However, it can be argued that a great deal are "informal" ones,&lt;ref name="ET1"/&gt; especially since it is possible to be a ''chasid umot ha'olam'' even when the Jubilee Year is not observed.&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer Sheva Mitzvot Hashem'', p. 28: {{Hebrew|ד חיוב בן נח ואפשרותו להיות חסיד אומ"ה הוא בכל זמן, ואינו תלוי בזמן שמקבלין גר תושב.}} The obligation of the gentile [lit. Descendant of Noah] and his ability to be a ''chasid umot ha'olam'' are at all times, and are not dependent on the time that we accept a ''ger toshav''."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern times and views ==
Judaism encourages non-Jews to adhere to the Noahide Laws.&lt;ref&gt;pp.27, 40 et al, ''Sefer Sheva Mitzvot Hashem''&lt;/ref&gt; Some groups, notably [[Chabad Lubavitch]], have set up classes and networks for Gentiles who commit themselves to this legal system (see [[Noahide Campaign]]). The [[Lubavitcher Rebbe]] himself encouraged his followers on many occasions to teach the [[Seven Laws of Noah]], devoting some of his addresses to the subtleties of this code.&lt;ref&gt;Likutei Sichot vol. 26, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Likutei Sichot vol. 35, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Likutei Sichot vol. 4, 1094&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a new code of law, written by Rabbi Moshe Weiner specifically for Noahides, was published under the auspices of Ask Noah International. The book's stated intention is to serve as the first ever "[[Shulchan Aruch]] for all the laws of the Children of Noah," and is entitled ''Sefer Sheva Mitzvot Hashem.''&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer Sheva Mitzvot Hashem'', title page&lt;/ref&gt; To grant it authority, it bears letters of endorsement from Rabbi [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]] of the Supreme Rabbinical Court of Israel, both the Chief Rabbis of Israel, and letters of blessing and approbation from various other notable rabbis around the world. In the code itself, it states that&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer Sheva Mitzvot Hashem'', p. 18. Square brackets in the original; round brackets are the translator's interpolations. Also see footnote 10 at length there, explaining the sources for the ruling. Original Hebrew: {{Hebrew|ולכן בזמן הזה, אע"פ שאין מקבלין ג"ת לענין זכויותיו [כגון לגור בארץ ישראל], מ"מ אם בא לקבל על עצמו מרצונו להיות גר תושב וחסיד אומ"ה בפני ג' לענין קבלת מצוותיו מקבלין אותו.}}&lt;/ref&gt; "at this time, while we do not accept ''geirim toshvim'' for the sake of (granting) the privileges of (the ''ger toshav'') [for example, to live in the Land of Israel], nevertheless, if he comes before (a rabbinical court of) three of his own free will to accept upon himself to be a ''ger toshav'' and one of the Pious People of the World, for the sake of accepting his mitzvot, we accept him." Later, it notes that one of the "Pious People of the World" (''chasid umot ha'olam'') is not necessarily also a ''ger toshav'', and it is possible to be a ''chasid umot ha'olam'' despite not being a ''ger toshav''. In fact, it lists four possibilities for Gentiles:&lt;ref name="SSMH27"&gt;''Sefer Sheva Mitzvot Hashem'', p. 27:
{{Hebrew|עוד מבאר בלקוטי שיחות ע"פ הצפנת פענח שחסיד אומות העולם אינו דוקא גר תושב, ואפשר לב"נ להיות חסיד אומות העולם, אע"פ שאינו גר תושב. ולכן לא הזכיר הרמב"ם כאן ש'אין מקבלין גר תושב אלא בזמן שהיובל נוהג' כדרכו בכל מקום (הארה: ראה הל' ע"ז פ"י, הל' מילה פ"א, הל' שבת פ"כ, הל' איסורי ביאה פי"ד.) שהזכיר דין ג"ת, כי אין כוונת הרמב"ם שכופין ב"נ להיות ג"ת, אלא לבאר האפשרויות העמודות לב"נ על פי התורה. א) גרות גמורה מרצונו, ב) קיום שבע מצוות – ועל זה צוה ה' את משה לכופם, ג) גר תושב, ד) למול עצמו.}}

"It is further explained in Likkutei Sichot according to the Tzafnat Pane'ach that a ''chasid umot ha'olam'' [lit. Pious People of the World] is not necessarily a ''ger toshav'', and it is possible for a Gentile [lit. Descendant of Noah] to be a ''chasid umot ha'olam'' despite him not being a ''ger toshav''. And therefore the Rambam did not mention here that "We only accept a ''ger toshav'' while the Jubilee Year is observed" as usual in all the places (footnote: See Hilchot Avodah Zarah ch. 10, Hilchot Milah ch. 1, Hilchot Shabbat ch. 20, Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah ch. 14) that he mentions the law of the ''ger toshav'', because the Rambam's intention was not that we force Gentiles [lit. Descendants of Noah] to be ''geirim toshvim'', but rather to explain the options that stand for the Gentile [lit. Descendant of Noah] according to the Torah: 1) Complete conversion by his own free will, 2) upholding the seven mitzvot – and regarding this, G‑d commanded Moses to compel them, 3) ''ger toshav'', 4) to circumcise himself."&lt;/ref&gt;
#Complete conversion to Judaism of his own free will
#Upholding the Seven Mitzvot of the Children of Noah, i.e. ''chasid umot ha'olam''
#''Ger toshav''
#Having himself circumcised
A Gentile is obligated to accept the Seven Mitzvot, but is not required to appear before a rabbinical court to become a ''ger toshav;'' that is a personal choice.&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer Sheva Mitzvot Hashem'', p. 28:
{{Hebrew|א. בן נח חייב לקבל על עצמו ולקיים שבע מצוות מפני שה' צוה לבני נח והודיע ע"י משה רבינו בתורה, והנזהר לקיימן משום כך הרי זה 'חסיד אומות העולם'....
ו. גר תושב וחסיד אומות העולם שתי תוערים הם. ואין ב"נ צריך לקבל על עצמו להיות גר תושב, וכן אינו צריך לקבל על עצמו עול ז' מצוות בפני בית דין ישראל.}}

"1. A Gentile [lit. Descendant of Noah] is required to accept upon himself and uphold the seven mitzvot because G‑d [so] commanded the children of Noah through our Teacher Moses in the Torah. One who is careful to uphold them because of this is a ''chasid umot ha'olam'' [lit. Pious People of the World]....
"6. ''Ger toshav'' and ''chasid umot ha'olam'' are two different terms. A Gentile is not required to accept upon himself to be a ''ger toshav'', and so too is not required to accept the yoke of the seven mitzvot before a Jewish ''beit din.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kellner (1991) on [[Maimonides]], a ''ger toshav'' could be a transitional stage on the way to becoming a ''ger tzedek'' ({{lang-he-n|גר צדק}}) or "righteous alien", a [[convert to Judaism]]. He conjectures that only a full ''ger tzedek'' would be found at the time of the Messiah.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides on Judaism and the Jewish people -Menachem Marc Kellner – 1991 (S U N Y Series in Jewish Philosophy) (9780791406915):  Page 44 "against my reading of Maimonides is strengthened by the fact that Maimonides himself says that the ger toshav is accepted only during the time that the Jubilee is practiced.43 The Jubilee year is no longer practiced in this dispensation ...... Second, it is entirely reasonable to assume that Maimonides thought that the messianic conversion of the Gentiles would be a process that occurred in stages and that some or all Gentiles would go through the status of ger toshav on ...But this question aside, there are substantial reasons why it is very unlikely that Maimonides foresaw a messianic era in which the Gentiles would become only semiconverts (''ger toshav'') and not full converts (''ger tzedek''). ...But the main thrust of all the Maimonidean texts we have been analyzing here is that in the days of the Messiah all human beings will stand before God equally and jointly. What is a semiconvert? Maimonides explains that the ger toshav "&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneersohn]] states that the status of ''ger toshav'' will continue to exist, even in the Messianic era. This is based on the statement in Hilchot Melachim 12:5 that "the entire world's (''kol ha'olam'') occupation will be nothing but to know G‑d." In its plain meaning, he asserts, ''kol ha'olam'' also includes Gentiles. As proof, he cites 11:4, also dealing with the Messianic era, where the similar term ''ha'olam kulo'', "the world in its entirety," clearly refers to Gentiles. Continuing the text in Hilchot Melachim 12:5, Maimonides explicitly changes the topic to Jews by using the term ''Yisra'el'', explaining that "Therefore, the Jews will be great sages and know the hidden matters, grasping the knowledge of their Creator according to the full extent of human potential," indicating that Jew and Gentile will co-exist in the time of the Messiah.&lt;ref&gt;Schneersohn, Menachem Mendel. ''Sha'arei Ge'ulah.'' pp. 267–8 (translated from Hebrew; emphasis and round brackets, but not the square brackets, in original text): There is a further detail in the wording of the Rambam in the completion and conclusion of his book &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Mishneh Torah]], Hilchot Melachim 12:5]: "And the occupation of the ''entire world'' will not be anything other than to know G‑d." Because in its plain meaning, it thereby includes the nations of the world as well (similar to what the Rambam wrote in the previous chapter, that the Messianic king will "improve ''the world in its entirety'' to serve G‑d... I will transform the ''nations'' etc."), especially since immediately afterwards the Rambam changes [terminology] and writes "And therefore ''Israel'' will be great sages etc." From this it is clear that the phrase ''entire world'' written above is intended to thereby include the children of Noah as well.&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, even when there is a Jewish king and a Sanhedrin, and all the twelve tribes live in the Land of Israel, Jewish law does not permit forcing someone to convert and become a ''ger tzedek'' against his will.&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188353/jewish/Chapter-8.htm Hilchot Melachim 8:10]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2633">A '''grant''', in [[law]], is a transfer of [[property]],&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary (1910), p. 547, ''citing'' 3 Washb. Real Prop. 181, 353.&lt;/ref&gt; generally from a person or other entity giving the property (the '''grantor''') to a person or entity receiving the property (the '''grantee''').&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary (1910), p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, a grant was a transfer by [[Deed (law)|deed]] of that which could not be passed by [[Livery#Sue one's livery|livery]],&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary (1910), p. 547, ''citing'' Williams, Real Prop. 147, 149; Jordan v. Indianapolis Water Co., 159 Ind. 337, (34 N. E. 680).&lt;/ref&gt; an act evidenced by [[letters patent]] under the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]], granting something from the king to a subject,&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary (1910), p. 547, ''citing'' Cruise, Dig. tit. 33, 34; Downs v. United States, 113 Fed. 147, 51 C. C. A. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; and a technical term made use of in deeds of conveyance of lands to import a transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary (1910), p. 547, ''citing'' 3 Washb. Real Prop. 378-380.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the word "grant" was originally made use of, in treating of conveyances of interests in lands, to denote a transfer by deed of that which could not be passed by livery, and was applied only to [[incorporeal hereditament]]s, it became a generic term, applicable to the transfer of all classes of [[real property]].&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary (1910), p. 547, ''citing'' 3 Washb. Real Prop. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

As distinguished from a mere [[license]], a grant passes some estate or interest, corporeal or incorporeal, in the lands which it embraces; can only he made by an instrument in writing, under seal; and is irrevocable, when made, unless an express power of revocation is reserved. A license is a mere authority; passes no estate or interest whatever; may be made by parol; is revocable at will; and, when revoked, the protection which it gave ceases to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary (1910), p. 547, ''citing'' Jameson v. Millemann, 3 Duer (N. Y.) 255, 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[conveyancing|legal conveyancing]], the grant is the means by which a party conveys title or encumbrance. In [[trust law]], the grant is the act by which the [[settlor]] creates the trust for the interests of the [[trustee]]. In an [[option contract]], the right of the optionee to exercise the option is considered a grant on the part of the optionor. In [[philanthropy]], a donor may provide a [[grant (money)|grant of money]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4409">The '''[[trademark|trade mark]] law of [[Hong Kong]]''' is based on the Trade Marks Ordinance Cap. 559, which came into force on 4 April 2003 and repealed the Trade Mark Ordinance Cap 43. The system established by this legislation is entirely separate to the system used in the [[People's Republic of China]], pursuant to the "[[One country two systems|one country-two systems]]" policy. The superseded law and the current law share many similarities with the relevant legislation in the [[United Kingdom]], a similarity which is also facilitated by [[TRIPs]].

The new law introduced various substantive and procedural changes, such as expanding the legal definition of a trademark; including or broadening protection for [[certification mark]]s, [[collective mark]]s, and [[well-known trade mark]]s; reducing the period of non-use for revocation purpose from five to three years; and simplifying and streamlining procedures for the registration of assignments, and "registrable transactions" such as licenses.

==Procedure==

===Filing to registration===

Registration of a trade mark in Hong Kong commences with the filing of an application at the  Trade Mark Registry of the Hong Kong Intellectual Property Department. An application may cover one or more classes of products and/or services. The standard total cost for using the services of a [[trademark attorney]] to handle the filing of an application in one class is HK $4,300 (the professional component of this fee is recommended by the Hong Kong Law Society). The official filing fees levied by the Intellectual Property Department of Hong Kong are HK$2000 for the first class and an additional HK$1000 per additional class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipd.gov.hk/eng/forms_fees/trademarks_559.htm|title=Trademarks Forms and Fees (Cap.559)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There will be additional fees for other stages in the registration process.

Firstly, the application is assessed by an examiner for deficiencies which go to formalities. The next stage is substantive examination, where the main grounds of objection could be raised: absolute grounds for refusal (e.g. where the mark is [[trademark#Registrability and distinctive character|inherently not registerable]]), and relative grounds for refusal (e.g. where the mark is identical or similar to mark covered by an application or registration filed earlier in time).

After the objections (if any) are overcome, the application will be accepted by the registry and published for opposition purposes for an extendable period of three months to allow third parties to object to registration of the mark on certain grounds.

Once any oppositions are resolved, a certificate of registration will be issued. The standard timeframe to registration for an application which encounters few if any problems or difficulties is 12 months.

Upon registration, and subject to the discussion on revocation below, a trade mark is valid for an extendible period of 10 years.

===Post-registration===

A registration for a trade mark may be subject to revocation by a third party if the trade mark has not been genuinely and continuously used for at least three years, and there are no valid reasons explaining the lack of use.

==The old law==

The old trade mark law (Cap. 43) divided the [[Registered trademark symbol|register]] of trade marks into two parts called "Part A" and "Part B", whereby the owners of [[trademark#Registrability and distinctive character|distinctive]] marks could seek registration under Part A, while the owners of marks with some distinctive character could pursue registration under Part B. Part B registration meant that certain rights were not available to the trade mark owner, which were otherwise available to the owner of a Part A registration.

Under the new law, the division of the register was abolished, and one standard of registrability was introduced.

[[Privacy]] concerns exist wherever [[personally identifiable information]] or other [[Information sensitivity|sensitive information]] is collected, stored, used, and finally destroyed or deleted – in [[Digital data|digital form]] or otherwise. Improper or non-existent disclosure control can be the root cause for privacy issues. Data privacy issues may arise in response to information from a wide range of sources, such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/464584332|title=Programme Management Managing Multiple Projects Successfully.|date=2009|publisher=Global India Pubns|others=Mittal, Prashant.|isbn=9380228201|oclc=464584332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information types ==
Various types of personal information often come under privacy concerns.

=== Internet ===
{{Main|Internet privacy}}

The ability to control the information one reveals about oneself over the internet, and who can access that information, has become a growing concern. These concerns include whether [[email]] can be stored or read by third parties without consent, or whether third parties can continue to track the websites that someone has visited. Another concern is if the websites that are visited can collect, store, and possibly share [[personally identifiable information]] about users.

The advent of various [[Web search engine|search engines]] and the use of [[data mining]] created a capability for data about individuals to be collected and combined from a wide variety of sources very easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2006-06-18-data-mining-privacy_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Research explores data mining, privacy | date=2006-06-18 | accessdate=2010-05-05 | first=Brian | last=Bergstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/154986_privacychallenge02.html | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first=Brian | last=Bergstein | title=In this data-mining society, privacy advocates shudder | date=2004-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/21472572/u-s-demands-google-web-data | work=Information Management Journal | title=U.S. Demands Google Web Data | year=2006 | first=Nikki | last=Swartz }} Vol. 40 Issue 3, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC has provided a set of guidelines that represent widely accepted concepts concerning fair information practices in an electronic marketplace called the [[Fair Information Practice Principles]].

In order not to give away too much personal information, emails should be encrypted. Browsing of web pages as well as other online activities should be done trace-less via "anonymizers", in case those are not trusted, by open-source distributed anonymizers, so called [[mix net]]s, such as [[I2P]] or [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor – The Onion Router]].

Email isn't the only internet content with privacy concerns. In an age where increasing amounts of information are going online, social networking sites pose additional privacy challenges. People may be tagged in photos or have valuable information exposed about themselves either by choice or unexpectedly by others. Caution should be exercised with what information is being posted, as social networks vary in what they allow users to make private and what remains publicly accessible.&lt;ref name="SchneiderTheInter08"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E1fQdrzxAPoC&amp;pg=PA17-IA137 |title=The Internet: Illustrated Series |author=Schneider, G.; Evans, J.; Pinard, K.T. |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=156 |year=2008 |isbn=9781423999386 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without strong security settings in place and careful attention to what remains public, a person can be profiled by searching for and collecting disparate pieces of information, worst case leading to cases of [[cyberstalking]]&lt;ref name="BocijCyber04"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cyberstalking: Harassment in the Internet Age and How to Protect Your Family |author=Bocij, P. |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |pages=268 |year=2004 |isbn=9780275981181}}&lt;/ref&gt; or reputational damage.&lt;ref name="CannataciPrivacy16"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGC_DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26 |title=Privacy, free expression and transparency: Redefining their new boundaries in the digital age |author=Cannataci, J.A.; Zhao, B.; Vives, G.T. et al. |publisher=UNESCO |page=26 |year=2016 |isbn=9789231001888 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cable television ===
This describes the ability to control what information one reveals about oneself over cable television, and who can access that information. For example, third parties can track IP TV programs someone has watched at any given time. "The addition of any information in a broadcasting stream is not required for an audience rating survey, additional devices are not requested to be installed in the houses of viewers or listeners, and without the necessity of their cooperations, audience ratings can be automatically performed in real-time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2010/0011389.html | work=FreePatentsOnline.com | title=System for Gathering TV Audience Rating in Real Time in Internet Protocol Television Network and Method Thereof| date=2010-01-14 | accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical ===
{{Main|Medical privacy}}

People may not wish for their medical records to be revealed to others. This may be because they have concern that it might affect their insurance coverages or employment. Or, it may be because they would not wish for others to know about any medical or psychological conditions or treatments that would bring embarrassment upon themselves. Revealing medical data could also reveal other details about one's personal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/amcis2011_submissions/341/|title=The Economic Effect of Privacy Breach Announcements on Stocks: A Comprehensive Empirical Investigation|first1=Nicholas-Donald,|last1=Aurelia|first2=Matus, Jesus|last2=Francisco|first3=Ryu,|last3=SeungEui|first4=Mahmood, Adam|last4=M|date=1 June 2017|website=aisnet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are three major categories of medical privacy: informational (the degree of control over personal information), physical (the degree of physical inaccessibility to others), and psychological (the extent to which the doctor respects patients’ cultural beliefs, inner thoughts, values, feelings, and religious practices and allows them to make personal decisions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Serenko|first=Natalia|author2=Lida Fan|title=Patients’ Perceptions of Privacy and Their Outcomes in Healthcare|journal=International Journal of Behavioural and Healthcare Research |year=2013|url=http://aserenko.com/IJBHR_Serenko_Fan.pdf|volume = 4|issue=2|pages= 101–122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Physicians and psychiatrists in many cultures and countries have standards for [[doctor-patient relationship]]s, which include maintaining confidentiality. In some cases, the [[physician-patient privilege]] is legally protected. These practices are in place to protect the dignity of patients, and to ensure that patients will feel free to reveal complete and accurate information required for them to receive the correct treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/everyday-law-encyclopedia/doctor-patient-confidentiality|title=If a patient is below the age of 18-years does confidentiality still works or should doctor breach and inform the parents?15years girl went for... - eNotes|website=eNotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To view the United States' laws on governing privacy of private health information, see [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and the [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act|HITECH Act]].

=== Financial ===
{{Main|Financial privacy}}
Information about a person's financial transactions, including the amount of assets, positions held in stocks or funds, outstanding debts, and purchases can be sensitive. If criminals gain access to information such as a person's accounts or credit card numbers, that person could become the victim of [[fraud]] or [[identity theft]].  Information about a person's purchases can reveal a great deal about that person's history, such as places he/she has visited, whom he/she has contacted with, products he/she has used, his/her activities and habits, or medications he/she has used. In some cases, corporations may use this information to target individuals with [[marketing]] customized towards those individual's personal preferences, which that person may or may not approve.

=== Locational ===
As location tracking capabilities of mobile devices are advancing ([[location-based service]]s), problems related to user privacy arise. Location data is among the most sensitive data currently being collected.&lt;ref name="AtaeiEphem16"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BdADQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA360 |title=Progress in Location-Based Services 2016 |chapter=Ephemerality Is the New Black: A Novel Perspective on Location Data Management and Location Privacy in LBS |author=Ataei, M.; Kray, C. |publisher=Springer |pages=357–374 |year=2016 |isbn=9783319472898 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A list of potentially sensitive professional and personal information that could be inferred about an individual knowing only his mobility trace was published recently by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blumberg, A. Eckersley, P.|title=On locational privacy and how to avoid losing it forever.|url=https://www.eff.org/wp/locational-privacy|publisher=EFF}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the movements of a competitor sales force, attendance of a particular church or an individual's presence in a motel, or at an abortion clinic. A recent MIT study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Montjoye|first=Yves-Alexandre|author2=César A. Hidalgo |author3=Michel Verleysen |author4=Vincent D. Blondel |title=Unique in the Crowd: The privacy bounds of human mobility|journal=Scientific Reports|date=March 25, 2013|doi=10.1038/srep01376|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130325/srep01376/full/srep01376.html|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Jason|title=Mobile location data 'present anonymity risk'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21923360|accessdate=12 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by de Montjoye et al. showed that four spatio-temporal points, approximate places and times, are enough to uniquely identify 95% of 1.5&amp;nbsp;million people in a mobility database. The study further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low. Therefore, even coarse or blurred datasets provide little anonymity.

=== Political ===
{{Main|Political privacy}}
[[Political privacy]] has been a concern since [[voting system]]s emerged in ancient times. The [[secret ballot]] is the simplest and most widespread measure to ensure that political views are not known to anyone other than the voters themselves—it is nearly universal in modern [[democracy]], and considered to be a basic right of [[citizenship]]. In fact, even where other rights of [[privacy]] do not exist, this type of privacy very often does.

=== Educational ===
In the United Kingdom in 2012, the Education Secretary [[Michael Gove]] described the [[National Pupil Database]] as a "rich dataset" whose value could be "maximised" by making it more openly accessible, including to private companies. Kelly Fiveash of ''[[The Register]]'' said that this could mean "a child's school life including exam results, attendance, teacher assessments and even characteristics" could be available, with third-party organizations being responsible for anonymizing any publications themselves, rather than the data being anonymized by the government before being handed over. An example of a data request that Gove indicated had been rejected in the past, but might be possible under an improved version of privacy regulations, was for "analysis on sexual exploitation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/08/national_pupil_database_regulation_overhaul_in_private_sector_data_grab/|title=Psst: Heard the one about the National Pupil Database? Thought not|date=2012-11-08|accessdate=2012-12-12|work=[[The Register]]|last=Fiveash|first=Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legality ==
{{Main|Information privacy law}}

The legal protection of the right to [[privacy]] in general – and of data privacy in particular – varies greatly around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brooklynworks.brooklaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1082&amp;context=bjil|title=Blurred Line: Zooming in on Google Street View and the Global Right to Privacy|last=Rakower|first=Lauren|date=2011|website=brooklynworks.brooklaw.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005101128/http://brooklynworks.brooklaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1082&amp;context=bjil|archive-date=2017-10-05|dead-url=no|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safe Harbor program and passenger name record issues ==
The [[United States Department of Commerce]] created the [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles]] certification program in response to the [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data|1995 Directive on Data Protection]] (Directive 95/46/EC) of the European Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/law/index_en.htm|title=Protection of personal data – European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directive 95/46/EC declares in Chapter IV Article 25 that personal data may only be transferred from the countries in the [[European Economic Area]] to countries which provide [[adequate]] privacy protection. Historically, establishing adequacy required the creation of national laws broadly equivalent to those implemented by Directive 95/46/EU. Although there are exceptions to this blanket prohibition – for example where the disclosure to a country outside the EEA is made with the consent of the relevant individual (Article 26(1)(a)) – they are limited in practical scope.  As a result, Article 25 created a legal risk to organisations which transfer personal data from Europe to the United States.

The program regulates the exchange of [[passenger name record]] information between the EU and the US. According to the EU directive, personal data may only be transferred to third countries if that country provides an adequate level of protection. Some exceptions to this rule are provided, for instance when the controller himself can guarantee that the recipient will comply with the data protection rules.

The [[European Commission]] has set up the "Working party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data," commonly known as the "Article 29 Working Party".  The Working Party gives advice about the level of protection in the European Union and third countries.

The Working Party negotiated with U.S. representatives about the protection of personal data, the [[Safe Harbor Principles]] were the result. Notwithstanding that approval, the self-assessment approach of the Safe Harbor remains controversial with a number of European privacy regulators and commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/docs/adequacy/sec-2004-1323_en.pdf|title=Protection of personal data – European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Safe Harbor program addresses this issue in the following way: rather than a blanket law imposed on all organisations in the [[United States]], a voluntary program is enforced by the FTC. U.S. organisations which register with this program, having self-assessed their compliance with a number of standards, are "deemed adequate" for the purposes of Article 25. Personal information can be sent to such organisations from the EEA without the sender being in breach of Article 25 or its EU national equivalents.  The Safe Harbor was approved as providing adequate protection for personal data, for the purposes of Article 25(6), by the European Commission on 26 July 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000D0520:EN:HTML|title=EUR-Lex – 32000D0520 – EN|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Safe Harbor, adoptee organisations need to carefully consider their compliance with the ''onward transfer obligations'', where personal data originating in the EU is transferred to the US Safe Harbor, and then onward to a third country. The alternative compliance approach of "[[binding corporate rules]]", recommended by many EU privacy regulators, resolves this issue.  In addition, any dispute arising in relation to the transfer of HR data to the US Safe Harbor must be heard by a panel of EU privacy regulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/docs/adequacy/information_safe_harbour_en.pdf|title=Protection of personal data – European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, a new, controversial,&lt;ref name=R89 /&gt; [[Passenger Name Record]] agreement between the US and the EU was made.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20120112021643/http://www.libertysecurity.org/article1591.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--NOTE: Archive-only. Domain usage has changed.--&gt; A short time afterwards, the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] gave exemption for the [[Department of Homeland Security]], for the [[Arrival and Departure Information System]] (ADIS) and for the [[Automated Target System]] from the [[1974 Privacy Act]].&lt;ref name=Exemption&gt;[[Statewatch]], [http://www.statewatch.org/news/2007/sep/04eu-usa-pnr-exemptions.htm  US changes the privacy rules to exemption access to personal data] September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, [[Jonathan Faull]], the head of the EU's Commission of Home Affairs, complained about the US bilateral policy concerning PNR.&lt;ref name=Faull&gt;[http://euobserver.com/9/25657 Brussels attacks new US security demands], European Observer. See also [http://www.statewatch.org/news/ Statewatch newsletter] February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The US had signed in February 2008 a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the [[Czech Republic]] in exchange of a visa waiver scheme, without concerting before with Brussels.&lt;ref name=R89&gt;[http://www.rue89.com/2008/03/04/a-divided-europe-wants-to-protect-its-personal-data-wanted-by-the-us A divided Europe wants to protect its personal data wanted by the US], ''[[Rue 89]]'', 4 March 2008 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tensions between Washington and Brussels are mainly caused by a lesser level of [[data protection]] in the US, especially since foreigners do not benefit from the US [[Privacy Act of 1974]]. Other countries approached for bilateral MOU included the United Kingdom, Estonia, Germany and Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[[Statewatch]], March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protecting privacy in information systems ==
As heterogeneous information systems with differing privacy rules are interconnected and information is shared, [[policy appliances]] will be required to reconcile, enforce, and monitor an increasing amount of privacy policy rules (and laws). There are two categories of technology to address privacy protection in [[Commerce|commercial]] IT systems: communication and enforcement.

;Policy communication
* [[P3P]] – The Platform for Privacy Preferences.  P3P is a standard for communicating privacy practices and comparing them to the preferences of individuals.

;Policy enforcement
* [[XACML]] – The Extensible Access Control Markup Language together with its Privacy Profile is a standard for expressing privacy policies in a machine-readable language which a software system can use to enforce the policy in enterprise IT systems.
* [[Enterprise Privacy Authorization Language|EPAL]] – The Enterprise Privacy Authorization Language is very similar to XACML, but is not yet a standard.
* WS-Privacy - "Web Service Privacy" will be a specification for communicating privacy policy in [[web service]]s.  For example, it may specify how privacy policy information can be embedded in the [[SOAP]] envelope of a web service message.

;Protecting privacy on the internet
On the internet many users give away a lot of information about themselves: unencrypted e-mails can be read by the administrators of an [[e-mail server]], if the connection is not encrypted (no [[HTTPS]]), and also the [[internet service provider]] and other parties [[packet analyzer|sniffing]] the network traffic of that connection are able to know the contents.
The same applies to any kind of traffic generated on the Internet, including [[web browsing]], [[instant messenger|instant messaging]], and others.
In order not to give away too much personal information, e-mails can be encrypted and browsing of webpages as well as other online activities can be done traceless via [[anonymizer]]s, or by open source distributed anonymizers, so-called [[mix network]]s.
Well known open-source mix nets include  [[I2P|I2P – The Anonymous Network]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].

=== Improving privacy through individualization ===

Computer privacy can be improved through [[forensic identification|individualization]]. Currently security messages are designed for the "average user", i.e. the same message for everyone.  Researchers have posited that individualized messages and security "nudges", crafted based on users' individual differences and personality traits, can be used for further improvements for each person's compliance with computer security and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://blues.cs.berkeley.edu/blog/2015/08/26/the-myth-of-the-average-user-improving-privacy-and-security-systems-through-individualization-nspw-15/|title = The Myth of the Average User: Improving Privacy and Security Systems through Individualization (NSPW ’15) {{!}} BLUES|website = blues.cs.berkeley.edu|access-date = 2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3550">'''Judicial discretion''' is the power of the [[judiciary]] to make some legal decisions according to their [[discretion]]. Under the doctrine of the [[separation of powers]], the ability of [[judge]]s to exercise discretion is an aspect of [[judicial independence]]. Where appropriate, judicial discretion allows  a judge to decide a legal case or matter within a range of possible decisions.

However, where the exercise of discretion goes beyond constraints set down by [[legislation]], by [[binding precedent]], or by a [[constitution]], the court may be abusing its discretion and undermining the [[rule of law]].  In that case, the decision of the court may be ''[[ultra vires]]'', and may sometimes be characterized as [[judicial activism]].

In 1824, US Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] wrote the following on this subject:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Judicial power, as contradistinguished from the power of the laws, has no existence. Courts are the mere instruments of the law, and can will nothing. When they are said to exercise a discretion, it is a mere legal discretion, a discretion to be exercised in discerning the course prescribed by law; and, when that is discerned, it is the duty of the court to follow it. Judicial power is never exercised for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the judge, always for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the legislature; or, in other words, to the will of the law.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/22/738/case.html Osborn V. Bank of the United States]'', 22 U. S. 738 (1824).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concerns with regard to [[recidivism]] and other [[law and order (politics)|law and order]] issues have led to the introduction of [[mandatory sentencing]]. E.g. [[three strikes law|three-strikes laws]] and most [[Sex offender registries in the United States|sex offender registry laws in US]] are examples of laws carrying severe consequences, and which does not leave room for sentencing judges to consider the actual gravity of the offense, thus significantly limiting judicial discretion in [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]]. Introduction of mandatory minimum in criminal sentencing is often viewed as a shift of judicial power from judges to [[prosecutor]]s, who are capable of affecting the length of potential sentence through their [[Prosecutorial discretion|charging decision]], e.g. filing [[Indictment|charges]] on [[lesser included offense]] and dropping the charges carrying mandatory minimum sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mandatory Minimum Penalties: Their Effects on Crime, Sentencing Disparities, and Justice System Expenditures|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/csj-sjc/ccs-ajc/rr02_1/p6.html|publisher=Department of Justice Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandatory sentencing laws have been particularly popular among legislators in the United States. This has provoked formation of non-profit organizations such as [[Families Against Mandatory Minimums]], [[Women Against Registry]] and [[RSOL]] to lobby for reinstatement of judicial discretion in criminal sentencing.

The '''LEED Professional Exams''' are administered by the [[Green Business Certification Inc.]] (GBCI) for professionals seeking to earn credentials and certificates.  The exams test knowledge based on the [[U.S. Green Building Council]]'s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Rating Systems.

==LEED Professional Credentials==
The LEED Professional Credentials were developed to encourage green building professionals to maintain and advance their knowledge and expertise. A LEED Professional Credential provides employers, policymakers, and other stakeholders with assurances of an individual’s current level of competence and is the mark of the most qualified, educated, and influential green building professionals in the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usgbc.org/leed/credentials&lt;/ref&gt; All LEED Professional Credentials require adherence to the LEED Professional Disciplinary and Exam Appeals Policy and require ongoing credential maintenance requirements either through continuing education and practical experience or through biennial retesting. Starting in 2009, newly credentialed individuals must maintain their credential on a two-year cycles; if not, they expire. There are three tiers in the LEED Professional Credentialing program:
* Tier 1: LEED Green Associate
* Tier 2: LEED AP with specialty
* Tier 3: LEED Fellow
 
Additionally, the LEED AP exam was offered from 2001 to June 30, 2009. This credential has been grandfathered in, does not require credential maintenance, and does not expire.

===LEED Green Associate===
For professionals who want to demonstrate green building expertise in non-technical fields of practice, GBCI has created the LEED Green Associate credential, which denotes basic knowledge of green design, construction, and operations.

The eligibility requirements for the LEED Green Associate exam no longer require candidates to have experience in the form of EITHER documented involvement on a LEED-registered project OR employment (or previous employment) in a sustainable field of work OR engagement in (or completion of) an education program that addresses green building principles. Candidates are still required to agree to the Disciplinary and Exam Appeals Policy and Credential Maintenance Program and submit to an application audit.

The LEED Green Associate exam consists of 100 randomly delivered questions which must be completed in 2 hours.  The content of the exam focuses on the LEED project process (including integrated design), core sustainability concepts, green building terminology, and various aspects of the LEED rating systems.

The fees associated with the LEED Green Associate are a $50 application fee, a $200 exam fee (per exam appointment) for USGBC national members and full-time students or $250 exam fee (per exam appointment) for all others, and a $85 biennial CMP renewal fee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usgbc.org/help/what-cost-credential-maintenance-renewal&lt;/ref&gt;

===LEED AP with Specialty===
The LEED AP (Accredited Professional) credential signifies an advanced depth of knowledge in green building practices; it also reflects the ability to specialize in a particular LEED Rating System. The LEED AP exam is divided into two parts. The first part is the LEED Green Associate exam, which demonstrates general knowledge of green building practices. The second part is a specialty exam based on one of the LEED Reference Guides.

The specialties are:
* LEED AP Building Design + Construction
* LEED AP Homes
* LEED AP Interior Design + Construction
* LEED AP Neighborhood Development
* LEED AP Operations + Maintenance

The eligibility requirements for the LEED AP exams are to have documented professional experience on a LEED project, within the last 3 years, with verification through LEED Online or employer attestation. Candidates are also required to agree to the Disciplinary and Exam Appeals Policy and Credential Maintenance Program and submit to an application audit.

The LEED AP exams consist of two parts, the LEED Green Associate exam and the applicable LEED AP specialty exam; each part contains 100 randomly delivered multiple choice questions and each part must be completed in 2 hours. Individuals must score at least 170 out of 200 in order to pass. While the LEED Green Associate focuses on concepts and terminology, the LEED AP with Specialty exam tests a candidate's in-depth understanding of one of the five main rating system categories. Candidates have to memorize performance thresholds (percentages of energy savings for example) and perform calculations during the exam.

The fees associated with the LEED AP exams are a $100 application fee and either a $300 exam fee (per exam appointment) for USGBC national members or a $450 exam fee (per exam appointment) for non-members.  For existing LEED Green Associates that wish to take the specialty exam only, there is either a $150 exam fee (per exam appointment) for USGBC national members or a $250 exam fee (per exam appointment) for non-members.  There is also a $85 biennial CMP renewal fee. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.usgbc.org/credentials/leed-ap/exam&lt;/ref&gt;

===LEED Fellow===
LEED Fellows are a highly accomplished class of individuals nominated by their peers and distinguished by a minimum of 10 or more years of professional green building experience. LEED Fellows must also have achieved a LEED AP with specialty credential. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.usgbc.org/credentials/leed-fellow&lt;/ref&gt;

==LEED Professional Certificates==
There are currently two LEED Professional Certificates:
* LEED for Homes Green Rater 
* Green Classroom Professional

Lawyers For Children has represented more than 40,000 foster, adopted, and abused children and young adults.  Lawyers For Children participated in the case ''Nicholson v.

{{Conflict of laws}}
'''''Lex loci solutionis''''' ([[Latin]]: "law of the place of performance"), in [[conflict of laws]], is the law applied in the place of an event.

If a case comes before a court and all the main features of the case are local, the court will then apply the ''[[lex fori]]'', the prevailing [[municipal law]], to decide the case. If there are foreign elements to the case, the forum court may then be obliged under the conflict of laws system to consider whether the forum court has [[jurisdiction]] to hear the case (see [[forum shopping]]).

It then [[characterisation (conflict)|characterises]] the issues and allocate the factual basis of the case to its relevant legal classes. It then applies [[choice of law]] rules to decide the law to be applied to each class.

''Lex loci solutionis'' is one of the possible choice of law rules applied to cases that test the validity of a [[contract (conflict)|contract]] or that deal with a [[tort (conflict)|tort]]. For example, if a person [[domicile (law)|domiciled]] in [[Bolivia]] and a person habitually resident in [[Germany]] make a contract by e-mail and agree to meet in [[Arizona]] to research a book, there would be several possibly-relevant choice of law rules:
* the ''[[lex domicilii]]'', ''[[lex patriae]]'' or the law of habitual residence to determine whether the parties had the [[capacity (law)|capacity]] to enter into the contract;
* ''[[lex loci contractus]]'', which could be difficult to establish since both parties never left their own [[jurisdiction (area)|state]] (reliance on postal rules for [[offer and acceptance]] in the several putative ''[[lex causae]]'' might produce different results)
* ''lex loci solutionis'' might be the most relevant since Arizona is the most closely connected to the substance of the obligations assumed
* the [[proper law]]
* ''lex fori'', which might have [[public policy (law)|public policy]] issues if one of the parties is a [[minor (law)|minor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29867">The '''Liberty City Seven''' were seven members of a small [[Miami]], [[Florida]]-based religious group who called themselves the Universal Divine Saviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2006/06/seas_of_david_or_seeds_of_davi.php|title=Seas of David?

[[Indictment|Indicted]] in [[United States federal courts|federal court]], three [[trial]]s of the Liberty City Seven [[defendant]]s took place. One defendant was [[Acquittal|acquitted]] in the first trial, but the jury [[Hung jury|deadlocked]] on the other six defendants and a mistrial occurred. The second trial also resulted in a deadlocked jury and a mistrial. On the third trial of the remaining six defendants, five were [[Conviction|convicted]] on some of the counts, including the group's leader, Narseal Batiste, the only defendant to be convicted on all four charges. One more defendant was acquitted of all charges in the third trial.

The charges centered on the group's belief that they were being offered money by someone in Yemen to help their mission in Liberty City, provided they supported the al-Qaeda jihad. The FBI agents represented themselves as representatives of [[al-Qaeda]], and persuaded Batiste to provide plans for a stated intention to destroy the [[Willis Tower|Sears Tower]] in [[Chicago]], the FBI field office in Miami, and other targets. [[Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation]] [[John S. Pistole]] described the group's plot as more "aspirational than operational"; the group did not have the means to carry out attacks on such targets.  The group had no weapons and did not seek weapons when they were offered.  The group had no communication with any actual al-Qaeda or other terrorist operatives.

And Batiste, the leader, called whites "devils" in the tradition of the original [[Nation of Islam]] and York's Moors. Now CNN is saying one member said they practiced witchcraft [likely meaning Haitian voodoo or perhaps Santería-like rituals]. One former member is called Levi-El, suggesting he might be associated with the [[Black Hebrew Israelites|Black Hebrew movement]] or an offshoot. Now a relative of one of the members, Phanor, said that they wore black uniforms with a star of David arm patch and considered themselves of the Order of Melchizadek ...

This Seas of David group primarily seems to have been studying the Bible. The mother of one insisted that he is a Catholic. Then there is all that Jewish symbology and terminology, even in their names. Islam was nothing more for them but a set of symbols they could pull into their syncretic local culture. The group drew on poor Haitian immigrants and local indigent African-American youth. If this were the 1960s, they'd have been Black Panthers or Communists.&lt;ref name="juancole.com"/&gt;}}

==Investigation and arrest==
Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales said in 2006 that the men had been taped promising to fight a "full ground war against the United States." The seven were arrested on June 23, 2006.

On June 22, 2006, a [[grand jury]] indicted the seven men. They were arrested during an FBI raid on the run-down warehouse in Liberty City, Miami in which the group met.&lt;ref name=LibertyCity2006-06-22&gt;

Five were U.S. citizens, one a legal immigrant from [[Haiti]], and the last an illegal alien originally from Haiti.  They were accused of planning to levy a "full ground war" against the United States.

Also involved was Charles James Stewart of the [[Moorish Science Temple]] in Chicago, a convicted rapist who was paid through the FBI informant to join the group in April.  He subsequently shot one of Batiste's followers and then became a witness against him and his supporters.&lt;ref name="wapocase" /&gt;

The two FBI informants, both Middle Eastern-born, were known as CW1, a Miami resident who had previous arrests for assault and marijuana possession, and CW2, who had worked for the FBI for six years and was awaiting approval of his petition for political asylum in the United States.&lt;ref name="wapocase"/&gt;

Narseal Batiste (also known by some as "Prinze Nas"), 32, is a father of four and a [[martial arts]] enthusiast, who had been a member of the [[Guardian Angels]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bizarre cult of Sears Tower 'plotter' |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-2242141,00.html |author=Paul Thompson |author2=Sarah Baxter |work=Sunday Times |date=2006-06-25 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908095707/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C2089-2242141%2C00.html |archivedate=September 8, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indictments accused the seven of being a domestic [[Clandestine cell system|terrorist cell]] who plotted to blow up the Sears Tower and the FBI building in Miami and had contact with [[al-Qaeda]] to attempt a bombing of Sears Tower. Although no links to outside terrorist groups were alleged, nor any weapons found,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5110342.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Seven charged over 'Chicago plot'|date=2006-06-23|accessdate=2006-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the arrests were the subject of a high level press briefing in [[Washington D.C.]] hosted by the Attorney-General&lt;ref name="pressconf"&gt;{{cite web|url=rtsp://video.c-span.org/project/ter/ter062306_gonzales.rm|format=RealAudio|title=DOJ Press Conference on a Terrorism Matter in Miami|publisher=C-Span.org|date=23 June 2006|accessdate=2006-10-16}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and made headline news in Europe the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/listenagain/zfriday_20060623.shtml|date=2006-06-23|publisher=BBC|title=Today program 'listen again'|accessdate=2006-10-16}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Director of the FBI [[Robert Mueller]] cited the incident in a "Major Executive Speech" in [[Cleveland]] that afternoon entitled "Protecting America from Terrorist Attack: The Threat of Homegrown Terrorism".&lt;ref name="fbiexec"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Remarks Prepared for Delivery by Director Robert S.

According to the indictments, the group had been infiltrated for nearly a year by two paid FBI informants posing as [[al-Qaeda]] members.  The warehouse they were in had been wired for surveillance and provided rent-free by the FBI since January, and members of the group discussed the terrorist plots with the undercover agents present while smoking [[marijuana]]. Differences had broken out in April between the leaders, causing one to be arrested for shooting a follower of the other.&lt;ref name="wapocase"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/01/AR2006090101764.html|title=FBI Role in Terror Probe Questioned - Lawyers Point to Fine Line Between Sting and Entrapment|date=2 September 2006|first=Walter|last=Pincus|author2=Julie Tate |author3=Madonna Lebling |publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2006-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presiding judge for all three trials was [[Joan A. Lenard]].

The first trial began on October 2, 2007 in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida]].  Prosecutors presented evidence drawn from 15,000 FBI recordings, including one in which Narseal Batiste said they would make sure no one survived destruction of the 110-story Sears Tower, and another which features ceremony in which each member of the group swears allegiance to al-Qaeda and [[Osama bin Laden]]. The defense claimed that the men played along with the talk by the FBI informants of terrorist plots in the hope of obtaining money, and that they never constituted a credible terrorist threat. In the second week of the trial two of the jurors were dismissed after a police [[counter-terrorism]] [[pamphlet]] was found in the jury room.

The defense rested its case on November 20, 2007. The prosecution alleging that although the defendants did not have the means to carry out a terrorist attack, they "were a ready-made [[terrorist cell]] here for al-Qaeda" who sought to use their attacks on the Sears Tower to spark an insurrection, topple the government, and bring about the destruction of the United States. [http://www.mail-archive.com/osint@yahoogroups.com/msg50073.html] The first trial ended on December 13, 2007.

A second trial ended on April 16, 2008, when Lenard declared a mistrial after the second jury reported they were deadlocked after 13 days of deliberations.

A third trial ended on May 12, 2009, when following two weeks of deliberation a jury acquitted Naudimar Herrera, but convicted the five remaining defendants. During the deliberations two of the jurors were replaced. Ringleader Batiste was convicted on all four charges brought against him. Abraham was convicted on three of the four counts against him. Phanor, Augustine, and Augustin were convicted two counts of [[providing material support for terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/13/us/13miami.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Damien | last1=Cave | first2=Carmen | last2=Gentile | title=Five Convicted in Plot to Blow Up Sears Tower | date=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five were sentenced on November 20, 2009 by Judge [[Joan Lenard]] after a three-day sentencing hearing:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ice.gov/pi/nr/0911/091120miami.htm|title=pi nr 0911 091120miami - Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Search Results|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Burson Augustin: 72 months in prison followed by 10 years of supervised release; and
*Rothschild Augustine: 84 months in prison followed by 10 years of supervised release.

==Members==
Batiste was the leader of the group. He is married and he and his wife Minerva have three boys and a girl
. Batiste's relatives described him as a "[[Moses]]-like" figure who roamed his neighborhood wearing a robe and carrying a crooked wooden cane as he recruited young men, based his teachings on those of the [[Moorish Science Temple of America]].&lt;ref name="Harnden"/&gt;

Batiste once drove a [[Federal Express|FedEx]] truck in [[Chicago]] and was a member of the volunteer [[Guardian Angels]], an anti-crime group. His father, Narcisse Batiste, sister and two of his brothers are [[Minister (Christianity)|Christian ministers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-sears24copy1.html | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother Audrey Batiste died in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2115811|title=U.S. News - National News|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the indictment, Batiste told an FBI informant posing as an [[al-Qaeda]] member around December 16, 2005 that he was organizing a mission to build an "Islamic Army" in order to wage [[jihad]] against the United States with his "soldiers" to destroy the [[Sears Tower]]. He requested a list of materials and equipment needed to wage jihad, including boots, uniforms, machine guns, radios, and vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.lp.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/terrorism/usbatiste62206ind.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527104310/http://news.lp.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/terrorism/usbatiste62206ind.html |archivedate=2011-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around December 22, 2005, he provided said "al-Qaeda representative" with shoe sizes of his "soldiers" and received military boots a week later.  Around that same time he requested radios, binoculars, bulletproof vests, vehicles and $50,000 cash.

On February 19, 2006, in a meeting with the "al-Qaeda representative," along with [[Patrick Abraham]], he expressed interest in attending al-Qaeda training during April and gave further details of the mission to wage "a full ground war" against the United States in order to "kill all the devils we can" in a mission that would "be just as good or greater than 9/11."  He requested a video camera for the trip to Chicago.

Around March 10, 2006 he along with Lyglenson Lemorin met with the FBI plant in Miami-Dade County, Florida and swore fealty to al-Qaeda.  Around March 16, 2006, along with Patrick Abraham, Stanley Phanor, Naudimar Herrera, Burson Augustin, Lyglenson Lemorin, and Rotschild Augustine, Batiste met with the "al-Qaeda representative," swore an oath of loyalty to al-Qaeda and discussed plans to bomb the FBI building in five cities.  At this meeting, Batiste took possession of a video camera and promised to obtain "good footage" of the North Miami Beach FBI building.

Around March 23, 2006, Batiste asked the FBI informant for a rental van for himself and his conspirators to take reconnaissance footage of the FBI building.  Around March 24, 2006, [[Patrick Abraham]] drove Batiste by car by the FBI and the National Guard Armory buildings in Miami-Dade, Florida.  Around the same date, they traveled with the "al-Qaeda representative" to purchase a digital camera.  Around March 26, 2006, Batiste and [[Burson Augustin]] provided the FBI informant with photographs and video footage of the FBI building and the James Lawrence King Federal Justice Building, federal courthouse, Federal Detention Center, and the Miami Police Department buildings.  They met again around April 6 to discuss the photographs and footage.

Around May 24, 2006, Batiste told the "al-Qaeda representative" that he was experiencing delays because of various problems within his organization but that he wanted to continue his mission and maintain his relationship with al-Qaeda.

==Press coverage of the arrests==
The arrests were announced on 23 June at a high level press briefing in [[Washington D.C.]] by the Attorney-General [[Alberto Gonzales]], the Deputy Director of the [[FBI]] John S. Pistole, and an Assistant Attorney-General Alice S. Fisher.&lt;ref name="pressconf"/&gt;

At the press conference, the Attorney-General and the Deputy Director took questions from reporters:
:'''Question:''' Did any of the men have any actual contact with any members of al-Qaeda that you know of?
:'''Attorney-General:''' The answer to that is "No".
:'''Question:''' Did they have any means to carry out this plot? I mean, did you find any explosives, weapons?
:'''Attorney-General:''' You raise a good point ... We took action when we had enough evidence.
:'''Question:''' Was there anything against the Sears Tower other than this one apparent, just, kind of mention of the Sears Tower? It doesn't look like they ever took pictures or ... 
:'''Deputy Director of the FBI:''' One of the individuals was familiar with the Sears Tower, had worked in Chicago, and was familiar with the tower.  But in terms of the plans, it was more aspirational than operational.&lt;ref name="pressconf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://149.101.1.32/ag/speeches/2006/ag_speech_0606231.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928034633/http://149.101.1.32/ag/speeches/2006/ag_speech_0606231.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 September 2007|title=Transcript of Press Conference Announcing Florida Terrorism Indictments|date=23 June 2006|accessdate=2006-10-16|publisher=Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He assured the public that the men posed no actual danger because their plot had been caught in "its earliest stages", and that the group's only source of money and weapons would have been the undercover FBI agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =  Seven charged over 'Chicago plot' | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5110342.stm | publisher = BBC Online | date = 2006-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following week the incident was featured on [[The Daily Show]], where [[Jon Stewart]] quipped: "Now, I am not a general.  I don't have any association with any military academy.  But I believe that if you are going to wage a full ground war against the United States, you need to field at least as many people as, say, a softball team."&lt;ref name="dailyshow"&gt;

[[Democracy Now]] interviewed two community activists in Miami on 26 June who summed up local reaction to the indictments:

{{quote|[A] lot of show has been made about the militaristic boots that they had ... [I]t turns out ... the FBI bought them the boots. If you look at the indictment, the biggest piece of evidence ... is that the group may have taken pictures of a bunch of targets in South Florida. But the guys couldn't afford their own cameras, so the federal government bought them the cameras ... The federal government rented them the cars that they needed to get downtown in order to take the pictures.

In addition ... the men provided the FBI informant with a list of things they needed in order to blow up these buildings, but in the list they didn't include any explosives or any materials which could be used to make explosives. So now everyone in Liberty City is joking that the guys were going to kick down the FBI building with their new boots, because they didn't have any devices which could have been used to explode ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/06/26/1349235|date=26 June 2006|accessdate=2006-10-16|title="Aspirational Rather than Operational" - 7 Arrested in Miami Terror Plot|publisher=Democracy Now|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018225348/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F06%2F26%2F1349235|archivedate=18 October 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his afternoon speech, the Director of the FBI, [[Robert Mueller]], cited the case to illustrate how his department's policies were working.  He also made reference to the case of [[Kevin James (alleged terrorist)|Kevin James]], the [[Toledo terror plot]], and the [[2006 Toronto terrorism case]].&lt;ref name="fbiexec"/&gt;

The '''miner's licence''' or '''sandstormer's licence''' was the colonial government's response to the need to provide infrastructure including policing during the [[Australian gold rushes]].  The first Australian mining laws were enacted in 1851. A proclamation by [[Charles La Trobe|Governor La Trobe]], of New South Wales, on 22 May 1851 asserted the Crown's right to all gold discovered in New South Wales. Governor Fitzroy invoked the "[[Case of Mines]]" (''R v Earl of Northumberland'') of 1567,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Case of Mines]]'' (1567) (''R v Earl of Northumberland'') 1 Plowd 310; 75 ER 472.&lt;/ref&gt; which confirmed the [[Royal prerogative|Crown's prerogative]] right to all gold and silver found in the Crown's realm. Victoria separated from New South Wales on 1 July 1851, and the [[Governors of Victoria|Victorian Lieutenant-Governor]] [[Charles La Trobe]] issued a similar proclamation on 16 August 1851.&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;Mining Law of Western Australia, by Michael W Hunt. {{ISBN|978-186287-729-0}}. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1852, Victoria enacted the Mining Act 1852 (repealed) supplemented by the Mining Act 1853 (repealed).&lt;ref name=Hunt /&gt; Before that, ownership of minerals and petroleum passed to those who were granted title to land by the colonial [[Governors of the Australian states|governors]] according to common law concepts, except the right to "Royal Mines" (the precious metals of [[gold]] and [[silver]]) which remained vested in [[the Crown]] by virtue of royal prerogative.&lt;ref name=Hunt /&gt;

Under the new regime, no man could dig for gold unless he had bought a licence. Initially, the fee for the licence was 30 shillings per month, an amount believed to be high enough to discourage unlucky diggers but not so high as to encourage rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Blainey | first = Geoffrey | authorlink = Geoffrey Blainey | title = The Rush That Never Ended | year = 1963  | publisher = Melbourne University Press | pages = 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fee was later reduced to 1 pound a month, or 8 pounds a year. The licence entitled the miner to 3.6 square metres (approx 38.75 sq feet, i.e., 6 feet square) of land, and the fee had to be paid regardless of whether or not gold had been found.

There had been protests against the miner's licence from its inception. The miners' grievance led to the formation of the [[Anti-Gold Licence Association]] in 1853, which resolved that miners pay no more than 10 shillings in licence fees and, if this reduction was refused, to pay no more fees.

On 30 August 1853, Lieutenant-Governor La Trobe announced the abolition of the licence system to be substituted by an export duty and a small registration fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | editor = Aplin, Graeme |editor2=S.G. Foster |editor3=Michael McKernan | title = Australians: Events and Places | date = 1987 | publisher = Fairfax, Syme &amp; Weldon Associates | location = Broadway, New South Wales, Australia | isbn = 0-949288-13-6 | chapter =| page = 65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[Victorian Legislative Council]] rejected La Trobe's proposal, so his promise was not enacted and the licence system continued.&lt;ref name="MarxistInterventions"&gt;{{cite web | last = McPherson | first = Hamish | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 2004 | url = http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/interventions/eureka.htm | title = "To stand truly by each other": The Eureka rebellion and the continuing struggle for democracy | work = Marxist Interventions: Articles from Australia in the social sciences | publisher = Australian National University | accessdate = 2006-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1853, only 400 of the 14,000 miners renewed their licences. The continued grievances led to outright rebellion known as the [[Eureka Stockade]] in [[Victoria, Australia]], in 1854. As a result of the Eureka Stockade, a [[Miner's Right]] was introduced in Victoria to replace the licence.

'''Otto Kirchheimer''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkɪɐ̯çˌhaɪmɐ|lang}}; 11 November 1905, [[Heilbronn]] – 22 November 1965, [[New York City]]) was a [[Germany|German]] jurist of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish ancestry]] and political scientist of the [[Frankfurt School]] whose work essentially covered the [[State (polity)|state]] and its [[constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arzt |first=Donna E. |chapter=Otto Kirchheimer: Critic of the Administration of Justice |title=Der Einfluß deutscher Emigranten auf die Rechtsentwicklung in den USA und in Deutschland |editor-last=Lutter |editor-first=Marcus |year=1993 |location=Tübingen |publisher=Mohr |isbn=3-16-146080-4 |pages=33–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirchheimer worked as a research analyst at the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), the forerunner of the [[CIA]], starting in [[World War II]] and continuing to 1952.&lt;ref name="oss"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9955.html |title=Secret Reports on Nazi Germany: The Frankfurt School Contribution to the War Effort |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
He is father of the concept of a "[[big tent|catch-all party]] (''Allerweltspartei'')". Otto Kirchheimer's conception of the catch-all party was part of his more comprehensive theory of party transformation, encompassing four interrelated political processes. By tracing the development of the catch-all thesis and placing it within the wider context of Kirchheimer's complete work, it is possible to reconstruct a more precise understanding of what Kirchheimer meant by the catch-all concept, which itself remains highly contested. Kirchheimer's anxiety about modern democracy originated with what he saw as the vanishing of principled opposition within parliament and society, and the reduction of politics to the mere management of the state. This leads to collusion of political parties and the state, severing of the societal links of party organisations, and erosion of the classic separation of powers. Vanishing opposition, cartelisation and professionalisation of politics pits citizens against a powerful state, which increases political cynicism and apathy. Kirchheimer's comprehensive approach remains relevant to much of the contemporary debate about the transformation of Western political systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krouwel|first=André|title=Otto Kirchheimer and the Catch-all Party|journal=West European Politics|year=2003|volume=26|issue=2|page=23|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402380512331341091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Research Fund (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) is funding the research and editorial work for an edition in five volumes of the ''Gesammelte Schriften'' (Collected Writings) of Otto Kirchheimer. The project began in late 2015 at [[Greifswald University]] and is scheduled to take about three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://buchstein.wordpress.com/forschung|title=Prof. Dr. Hubertus Buchstein|website=Greifswald University|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14863">The status of '''permanent normal trade relations''' ('''PNTR''') is a legal designation in the United States for free trade with a foreign nation. In the United States, the name was changed from [[most favored nation]] (MFN) to PNTR in 1998.

In [[international trade]], MFN status (or treatment) is awarded by one nation to another. It means that the receiving nation will be granted all trade advantages, such as low [[tariffs]], that any other nation also receives. Thus, a nation with MFN status will not be discriminated against and will not be treated worse than any other nation with MFN status.&lt;ref name="CRS MFN" /&gt;

==Applicability==

Granting of permanent normal trade relations status is automatic, except where specifically denied by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|19|2136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following countries are specifically denied NTR status, as of 2005:&lt;ref name="CRS"&gt;http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/crs/96-463.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cuba]] (see [[United States embargo against Cuba]])
* [[North Korea]] (see [[North Korea–United States relations]])

The following countries are temporarily afforded NTR treatment by presidential waiver in accordance with the [[Jackson–Vanik amendment]], as of 2005:&lt;ref name="CRS" /&gt;
* [[Belarus]]
* [[Turkmenistan]]

The following countries are temporarily afforded NTR treatment by a presidential compliance determination, in accordance with the [[Jackson–Vanik amendment]], as of 2005:&lt;ref name="CRS" /&gt;
* [[Azerbaijan]]
* [[Kazakhstan]]
* [[Tajikistan]]
* [[Uzbekistan]]

Embargoes also apply to additional parties; see [[United States embargoes]].

==History==
In 1948 the United States joined the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the predecessor organization of the [[World Trade Organization]]. In accordance with GATT provisions the United States agreed to extend what was then called Most Favored-Nation status (MFN) to all GATT member countries. This status was also applied to some countries that were not GATT members. However, a member may opt out of its obligations by invoking the non-application provision (Article XIII of the WTO or Article XXXV of the GATT) if it determines it cannot extend GATT/WTO principles to newly acceding members for political reasons.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt;  In 1951, the U.S. Congress directed President [[Harry Truman]] to revoke MFN status to the [[Soviet Union]] and other [[Communist]] countries except for [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name=CRS&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jackson-Vanik Amendment andCandidate Countries for WTO Accession:Issues for Congress|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3APCbRC1D72n0J%3Awww.hsdl.org%2F%3Fview%26did%3D729527+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=13 April 2013|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130626185623/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:PCbRC1D72n0J:www.hsdl.org/?view%26did%3D729527+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us|archivedate=26 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cold War]], most Communist countries were denied MFN status if they did not meet certain conditions.&lt;ref name="CRS MFN"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pregelj|first=Vladimir N.|title=Normal-Trade-Relations (Most-Favored-Nation) Policy of the United States|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poland was granted MFN status in December 1960 by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]].&lt;ref name="CRS MFN"/&gt; In 1962, Congress enacted a directive that jeopardized the MFN status of [[Poland]] and [[Yugoslavia]]; however, the directive was delayed until a new one was passed that allowed any countries with MFN to keep the status if the President determined it to be in the national interest of the United States.&lt;ref name="CRS MFN"/&gt;

Title IV of the [[Trade Act of 1974]] superseded these provision. Section 401 of Title IV requires the President to withhold MFN status from countries that had not acquired that status by the time of the law’s enactment on January 3, 1975. In effect, this meant all communist countries, except Poland and Yugoslavia. Section 402, the [[Jackson-Vanik amendment]], withholds MFN status from countries with strict restriction on freedom of emigration.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt; Countries that wish to have PNTR must fulfill two basic requirements:{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} (1) comply with the [[Jackson-Vanik amendment|Jackson-Vanik]] provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 that states that the President of the United States determines that a country neither denies or impedes the right or opportunity of its citizens to emigrate; and (2) reach a bilateral commercial agreement with the United States. Jackson-Vanik allows for the President to issue a yearly waiver to allow the granting of PNTR.

For many years, [[People's Republic of China]] was the most important country in this group which required an annual waiver to maintain [[free trade]] status. The waiver for the PRC had been in effect since 1980. Every year between 1989 and 1999, legislation was introduced in Congress to disapprove the President's waiver. The legislation had sought to tie free trade with China to meeting certain [[human rights]] conditions that go beyond freedom of emigration. All such attempted legislation failed to pass.  The requirement of an annual waiver was inconsistent with the rules of the [[World Trade Organization]], and for the PRC to join the WTO, Congressional action was needed to grant PNTR to the PRC.  This was accomplished in late 1999, allowing the PRC to join WTO in the following year.&lt;ref name="crs china MFN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/crs/rl30225.pdf|title=Most-Favored-Nation Status of the People’s Republic of China|last=Pregelj|first=Vladimir N.|date=2001-06-07|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By Act of Congress, the United States granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status to [[Czechoslovakia]] (later the Czech Republic and Slovakia), [[Hungary]], and [[Romania]] after the fall of the communist governments in those countries.The United States granted PNTR to [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Cambodia]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] before their countries acceded to the WTO.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt; Before it granted PNTR, the United States invoked the non-application provision against [[Mongolia]] for more than two years after it joined the WTO on January 29, 1997. It also invoked the provision against [[Armenia]] from its WTO accession on February 5, 2003, until it was granted PNTR on January 7, 2005, and with [[Kyrgyzstan]] from when it joined the WTO on December 20, 1998, until receiving PNTR on June 29, 2000.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt;

[[Vietnam]] was given temporary free trade status in 2001 on a year-to-year waiver basis. As a prerequisite for that country's accession to the WTO. Vietnam has had PNTR status since December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2008/jun/106220.htm The United States and Vietnam: Expanding Relations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016040507/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2008/jun/106220.htm |date=October 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ukraine]] was granted PNTR in 2006. In December 2012, President [[Barack Obama]] signed the Russia and Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 ([[Magnitsky Act]]) granting PNTR to [[Russia]] and [[Moldova]].&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt;

==U.S. and China==
In the last year of his presidency, [[Bill Clinton]] called on Congress to help him change China’s normal trade relations status with the U.S. to permanent. This would amend the [[Trade Act of 1974]] which had the trade status of China annually reviewed to determine the best course of action. The piece of legislation was introduced to the house as H.R. number 4444 on May 15, 2000 by [[William Reynolds Archer]], a Republican Representative from Texas (he had three cosponsors). Introduce to the house the legislation referred to the [[Ways and Means committee]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to be amended and written up.&lt;ref name="Dreier"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dreier|first=David|title=H. Res. 510: providing for further consideration of the (H.R. 4444) to authorize extension|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=hr106-510}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation was introduced by saying that the bill was a top priority for the rest of the year and it was vital to the U.S. agriculture market to have access to a market that accounts for one-fifth of the world’s population.&lt;ref name="Greenspan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenspan|first=Alan|title=Clinton and Greenspan on China PNTR, 2000|url=http://china.usc.edu/(S(jm1mk455bcqdur45atujzbaz)A(GGMQWGIkywEkAAAAYjUzYTIwODItZDE5Zi00YmJlLWJkMjEtZGZhMmE0ZDZiOWJmumf3j0Im8bow96ja5KHosctqj_o1))/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=537&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other crucial point made was the involvement the U.S. needed to help the workers of the People’s Republic of China to lead better lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Committee on Ways and Means|title=. "Rep. Rangel Announces decision to vote 'yes' on granting PNTR to China."|url=http://waysandmeans.house.gov/news.asp?FormMode=release&amp;id=755&amp;keywords=PNTr|publisher=Government|accessdate=16 Apr 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress added some important points into the legislation to make sure that when China entered the World Trade Organization it could be reprimanded for crimes against the workers of the country, and certain markets would be mutually exclusive between the two countries.  The People’s Republic of China’s businesses had to abide by human rights for their workers as stated in the internationally recognized worker rights.  To monitor the workers’ rights Congress established the Congressional–Executive Commission on the People’s Republic of China. The commission was to monitor acts of China which reflect compliance or violation, compile lists of persons believed to be imprisoned, detained, or tortured due to pursuit of their human rights, monitor the development of the rule of law in China, and encourage the development of programs and activities of the U.S. government and private organizations with a goal of increasing the interchange of people and ideas. The committee formed, along with the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]] (USTR), and the [[International Trade Commission]] (ITC) was to give an annual report to the President.&lt;ref name="Dreier"/&gt;

Congress believed that they needed to pass a bill that would help the [[economy]] stay stimulated if not have a higher growth than at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ways and Means committee|title=Archer Announces Hearing on Accession|url=http://waysandmeans.house.gov/legacy.asp?file=legacy/fullcomm/106cong/fc-21.htm&amp;keywords=Permanent+Normal+Trade+Act+|accessdate=25 Apr 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most productive and trouble-free way to keep the economy growing strong was to [[outsource]] and trade more with China. China was to help provide America with superior markets in industry, agriculture, and technology. Congress as whole thought that without these things America would fall behind economically and technologically to some enemies of America.{{citation needed|reason=This is a strong statement which needs a citation to back up its authenticity.|date=October 2015}} If China did not get support from America they could go to another country that would not be so strict on their treatment of people, and they could use that country to gain access to the WTO. The down side to this was that no markets could provide and receive China’s goods like the United States markets could.&lt;ref name="Greenspan"/&gt;

The International Trade Commission’s report was the determination of China’s impacts on United States market, and how those certain disruptions can be remedied or expanded. The ITC was to find what domestic industries were being hurt by the trade and to present how the repair could be made. This was the most important part of the bill for most of the country. The bill breaks down to depending on how the different markets in the U.S. economy are doing it can use China’s markets as a catalyst to help stabilize when need be.{{Clarify|date=March 2016}}

The bill created a stir among Congress and the American people when presented because people did not believe that America could actually do anything to help regulate China’s treatment of workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carpenter|first=Amanda|title=Q&amp;A with Congress: 'Bill Clinton, Sold Out America on His Trade Policy,' says rep. Defazio.|url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=14855|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from people’s rights activists many business men believed in the bill to help flourish the different areas of industry. The legislation was passed by the House of Representatives on May 24, 2000 and by the Senate on September 19, 2000. Members of the senate wanted to add in amendments on treating their workers even better than stated in previous legislation, and to make the punishment for breaking the rules greater. Congress was up for re-election that year so due to time constraints all twenty four amendments were rejected. The President signed on Oct 10, 2000 and that day it became Public Law No: 106-286.&lt;ref name="Dreier"/&gt;

US imports from China more than quadrupled between 2000 and 2015, increasing the decline of US manufacturing jobs.&lt;ref name="jtank"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tankersley|first1=Jim|title=What Republicans did 15 years ago to help create Donald Trump today|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/21/how-republicans-helped-create-donald-trump-more-than-15-years-ago/|accessdate=22 March 2016|publisher=Washington Post|date=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the passing of the bill there have been three attempts to repeal the PNTR with China. The strongest attempt was in 2005 when House Rep. [[Bernie Sanders]] and 61 co-sponsors introduced a legislation that would repeal the Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. Rep. Sanders said to the house, "anyone who takes an objective look at our trade policy with China must conclude that is an absolute failure and needs to be fundamentally overhauled". The Representative goes into numbers of the trade deficit increased and the number of American jobs being lost to our overseas competitors. One point that Sanders did not make due to time constraints and the legislation being passed so quickly was that nothing in the way China treats its workers has changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kusumi|first=John|title=Monster Versus Monster: the Democratic Race|year=2008|publisher=Nolanchart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2871">'''Political naturalism''' is a minor [[political ideology]] and [[legal system]] which believes that there is a [[natural law]], just and obvious to all, that crosses ideologies, faiths and personal thinking, that naturally guaranties justice. It is inspired by [[sociological naturalism]], and [[methodological naturalism|scientific naturalism]]'s belief that the precision of [[natural sciences]] can be applied to social sciences, and hence to practical social activities like politics and law.

It may be seen as a natural law-based version of [[Liberal legalism|legalism]]/[[constitutionalism]] (especially [[Constitutionalism#Prescriptive use|of prescriptive constitutionalism]], in the way it tries, idealistically, to make a constitution how it should justly be), and it bears relation with many [[constitutional monarchies]] (as in that system they too believe in [[rule of the law]] and in certain things who are naturally correct (like [[monarchy]], monarchic [[institutions]] and [[traditions]].

The roots of this legal political ideology may be found in positive visions of natural law (like [[John Locke]]'s and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s, and even in the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:United States Declaration of Independence|United States Declaration of Independence]], 1776, "We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic]] [[Germany|German]] [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] politician and diplomat Karl Friedrich von Savigny also thought so.&lt;ref&gt;He stated that "laws are not made ''but found''", implying the existence of already existing natural laws.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main modern thinker is [[Egypt]]ian legal scholar and creator of the [[Egyptian Civil Code]] [[Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri|Al-Razzak Al-Sanhuri]].&lt;ref&gt;Abd Al-Razzak Al-Sanhuri, Egyptian Civil Code, Article 1, 1949, ''«in the absence of any applicable legislation, the judge shall decide according to the custom and failing the custom, according to the principles of Islamic Law. In the absence of these principles,'' '''the judge shall have recourse to natural law''' ''and the rules of equity.»''&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Egyptian Code, many other Arab constitutions (in monarchist and pre-dictatorships [[Iraq]] and [[Libya]] and modern [[Qatar]]) ended up including political naturalist laws, and Al-Sanhuri himself wrote the [[Syrian]] and [[Jordan]]ian [[civil codes]] and the [[Kuwait]]i [[commercial code (law)|commercial code]].

The '''Praetor's Edict''' ''(Edictum praetoris)'' in ancient [[Roman law]] was an annual declaration of principles made by the new ''[[Praetor]] urbanus'' – the elected magistrate charged with administering justice within the city of Rome.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Such Edicts were also issued by the ''Praetor peregrinus'' and by the [[Aediles]].&lt;/ref&gt; During the early Empire the Praetor's Edict was revised to become the '''Edictum perpetuum'''.

==Legality==

The incoming Praetor by his [[Edict]] laid out legal principles he intended to follow when making judicial decisions during his year in office. To some degree the new Praetor had sufficient discretion to modify the existing Edict of the former Praetor. Many years the new Praetor would simply adopt and so continue the contents of Edict he "inherited" from his predecessor.

Praetors often did not possess any special expertise in law, but rather were successful politicians. So, in deciding whether or not to augment or otherwise modify the Edict, the new Praetor would usually consult with Roman jurists who were familiar with the applicable areas of the law, and who knew the emerging currents of legal change. Language from the [[responsa]] of these Roman scholars of [[jurisprudence]] often found its way into the Edict.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Schulz at 53.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Praetor's Edict had legal force only during the incumbency of the particular Praetor who issued it. Yet, as the pre-existing contents of the ongoing Edict were generally adopted by next Praetor, the Edict attained substantial continuity, subject to marginal changes. On the other hand, the yearly changes usually resulted in welcome legal innovations. With the accretion of annual modifications, the document grew in stature, as well as in size, scope, and reach; it became a primary source of legal growth and evolution. In 67 BCE, a ''lex Cornelia de edictis'' passed, which required the Praetor to abide by his own Edict.&lt;ref&gt;Adolph Berger at 549.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

The reconstructed Edict we have today is divided into five parts: I preliminary procedures, II ordinary remedies, III summary remedies, IV execution of judgment, V formulas, interdicts, exceptions, stipulations. Also the Edict has 45 titles, with some subdivisions, and 292 paragraphs. Many paragraph entries contain only the subject matter addressed, without any of its substance (which is unknown to us). While much is considered authentic, uncertainties and unresolved disputes remain for further study. Much is missing.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Coleman-Norton, Bourne at 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example quotations===

Several miscellaneous examples taken from the reconstructed Edict:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Persons under twenty-five years old. Whatever is said to have been transacted with a person less than twenty-five years old, I shall consider each case on the basis of its particulars." Paragraph 41, in the first part, from title X "Restorations to Original Status".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Coleman-Norton, Bourne at 185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whence anything is thrown out or is poured out onto that place where commonly is made a road or where persons assemble I shall grant an action, for twice as much damage as thereby is caused or done against the person who dwells there." From paragraph 61, in the second part, from title XV "Those Goods That Are in Anyone's Property".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Coleman-Norton, Bourne at 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The institorian action. Whatever is transacted with an agent in respect to that thing for which he is appointed, against the person who appoints him I shall grant an action." Paragraph 102, in the second part, from title XVIII "Whatever Business Is Transacted with a Shipmaster or an Agent Who Is in Another Person's Power".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Coleman-Norton, Bourne at 187&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|An ''institor'' was a type of business agent for buying and selling. &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Coleman-Norton, Bourne at 198 note 76&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whoever hides for the purpose of defrauding his creditors, if he is not defended according to the judgment of an honorable man, I shall order his property pursuant to the edict to be possessed, to be advertised for sale, and to be sold." Paragraph 205, in the fourth part, from title XXXVIII "Those Causes for Which a Person Enters into Possession".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Coleman-Norton, Bourne at 191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"As you now possess certain land about which there is the present action, which land the one party has procured from the other party neither by violence nor secretly nor by precarium, in such manner you shall possess it. Against these conditions, I forbid violence to be employed." Paragraph 247a, in the fifth part, from title XlIII "Interdicts", from subdivision vi "Interdict on as you possess".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Coleman-Norton, Bourne at 193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Reconstruction===

The Edict we have now has been reconstructed from various sources, mainly from juristic commentaries on it, such as that of [[Furius Anthianus]]. Because of its great importance, the Praetor's Edict, or portions of it, often became the subject of detailed examination and study, in the course of which the specific content of the Edict would be described or quotations would be made directly from it. Of course, much of the literature of the ancient world has been lost, the works of Roman jurist included. Those juristic works that do survive usually come from the latter, or classical, period of Roman Law. Accordingly, most of the Edict we have now is based on the content of the Edict revised in AD 129 by Hadrian (see below). How much and in what fashion and degree this Edict of Hadrian's reign differs from the earlier Praetor's Edict of the Roman Republic are questions that may only be addressed by informed speculation.

==Formulary procedure==

An important aspect of the Praetor's Edict concerned formulary procedure. During the late Republic, the trial at civil law increasingly employed formulary procedure. In this process, the Praetor first determines the legal issue in a pending case. Then the Praetor decides on a prescriptive formula which instructs what remedy will be appropriate depending on what facts are found. Then the Praetor assigns the case to a ''iudex'' for trial. After the facts are determined at trial, the ''iudex'' gives judgment according to the formula. 

The Praetor's Edict contained many different principle of law, often drawing on prior legal rulings. Besides the trial formulas, it also regulated procedural matters, such as the initiation of a legal suit. In time, such sample formulae became listed by the Praetor in his Edict issued at the beginning of his term of office.

==Influence==

As later summarized by the Roman jurist [[Papinian]] (c. 148–211), the law that was developed by the Praetors in their Edict became an instrument which could supplement, explain, and improve the [[Ius civile]]. He writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Praetorian law (''jus praetorium'') is that which in the public interest the praetors have introduced in aid or supplementation or correction of the ''jus civile''. This is also called honorary law (''jus honorarium''), being so named for the high office (''honos'') of the praetor."&lt;ref&gt;Aemilius Papinian from his ''Definitions'', as excerpted in the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] of Emperor Justinian: ''Digest'', 1.1.7.1, translated in [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Alan Watson]], editor, ''The Digest of Justinian'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania 1985, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Thus, the Praetor's Edict developed into an important vehicle for the evolution of Roman civil law. A great deal of commentary was written by jurists concerning this "praetorian law" or ''ius honorarium'', addressing the legal principles contained in this Edict.

==Edictum perpetuum==

Eventually, the above discretion allowed the ''Praetor urbanus'' regarding his Edict was no longer considered appropriate. Accordingly circa CE 129, action was taken that severely restricted its further modification. Under the emperor [[Hadrian]] (r. 117–138), the celebrated jurist [[Salvius Julianus]] made a formal revision to the ''Praetor's Edict'' as well as to similar edicts, e.g., that of the [[Aediles]]. This newly edited and consolidated version of the edict then became fixed, subject only to changes approved by the Emperor: hence, the ''Edictum perpetuum''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Coleman-Norton, Bourne at 182–204.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''protectory''' is a Roman Catholic institution for the shelter and training of the young, designed to afford neglected or abandoned children shelter, food, raiment and the rudiments of an education in religion, morals, science and manual training or industrial pursuits.
 
Institutions of this character are to be found in most of the dioceses of the United States. They are usually open to the reception of juvenile delinquents, who, under the better ideas now obtaining in criminal procedure, are committed by the courts, especially by [[Juvenile Court]]s, to educational rather than to penal institutions.
 
==History==
San Michéle, the first protectory for youth, was founded at Rome in 1704 by [[Pope Clement XI]]. When John Howard, the English prison reformer (1726–90), visited the institution, he read above the entrance this inscription: "Clement XI, Supreme Pontiff, for the reformation and education of criminal youths, to the end that those who when idle had been injurious to the State, might, when better instructed and trained, become useful to it. In the Year of Grace 1704; of the Pontiff, the fourth". On a marble slab inserted in one of the interior walls he read further: "It is of little use to restrain criminals by punishment, unless you reform them by education". This became the keynote of modern [[penology]]. The inmates worked together by day in a large hall where was hung up in large letters, visible to all, the Latin word ''silentium'', indicating that the work must go on in silence. At night they slept in separate cells. This system of associated or congregate labour in silence by day and cellular separation at night, for which, under the name of the [[Auburn System]], so much excellence has been claimed in American penology, was thus inaugurated at Rome in the beginning of the eighteenth century, more than a hundred years prior to the introduction of the method into use here. The same wise pontiff established in connexion with this foundation of San Michéle a special court for the trial of offenders under twenty years of age, a plan that has re-appeared in the last decade in the Juvenile Courts established in America and eelsewhere for the trial of delinquents under (seventeen years of) age. 

Secular protectories or [[reform school]]s, or euphemestically termed "training schools", were instituted in America during the initial quarter of the nineteenth century. On 1 January 1825, the House of Refuge was opened with appropriate exercises on what is now Madison Square, [[New York City]]. Nine children, just gathered from the streets, were present and formed the nucleus of the new establishment that later grew to vast proportions on [[Randalls and Wards Islands|Randalls Island]]. [[Boston]] followed with a similar institution in 1826; [[Philadelphia]] in 1828; and in 1855 a girls' reformatory was founded at [[Lancaster, Massachusetts]] on the family or cottage plan, dividing the institution into three separate houses of thirty girls each, with their three matrons, all under the general supervision of a superintendent.
 
In 1904, according to the [[U.S. Census]] Reports, there were thirty-nine states and territories with institutions for juvenile delinquents, and these had ninety-three institutions exclusively for such children, reporting a population; between seven and twenty-one years of age, of 23,034 as against 14,846 population in such institutions on 1 June 1890. These figures did not include children placed in these institutions by parents or guardians without the sanction or order of a magistrate or other lawful committing authority, nor persons under twenty-one years of age committed to institutions that are not exclusively for juveniles, e.g. [[jail]]s and [[workhouse]]s. Inquiry at the Census Office in Washington showed there were one hundred and three institutions for juvenile delinquents in 1910; eighty-seven of these institutions reported 22,096 inmates on 1 January 1910.

==Ownership==
In the great majority of cases the institutions are public. But the report of the Census entitled "Prisoners and Juvenile Delinquents in Institutions: 1904" observes that in several states the reformation and correction of delinquents are entrusted in whole or in part to private or religious agencies, and distinguishes as the most notable among these the Catholic Protectory in what is now the [[Parkchester]] section of the Bronx, the largest institution of the kind in the U.S., which in 1904 contained 2566 delinquents and dependents. The actual number present in this institution on 31 December 1909, was 2320, of whom 540 were girls accommodated in a department and buildings separate from the boys under the care of the Sisters of Charity. The boys were in charge of the [[Brothers of the Christian Schools]], of the Institute founded by St. John Baptiste de la Salle. Another large protectory, St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys in charge of the [[Xaverian Brothers]] at Baltimore, Md., had a juvenile population of 748 on 1 December 1909. Since 1866, St. Mary's has cared for 7593 boys. Similar institutions were: in the United States, at [[Chicago]], Illinois; [[Arlington, New Jersey]] (Diocese of Newark); Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and [[Utica, New York]] (Diocese of Syracuse). In Canada, 4 in the Archdiocese of Montreal. In England: for boys, at [[Walthamstow]], Essex; [[Farnworth]], Lancashire; [[Birkdale]], Lancashire and [[Market Weighton]], Yorkshire nad{{Clarification|date=December 2017}} for girls, at Bristol, Gloucestershire and Liverpool, Lancashire. In Scotland, at Parkhead, Glasgow. In Ireland: for boys, at Glencree, Co. Wicklow, and Philipstown, King's Co.; for girls, at Drumcondra, Co. Dublin.

==Protectories now==
Most of the juvenile delinquents sent to institutions in the United States are committed either during minority or for an indeterminate period. Statistics show that female delinquents are committed during minority more frequently than the males. On the other hand, commitment for an indeterminate period was more frequently imposed upon males than females. Most of these delinquents are literate. During 1904, of the male delinquents, 84.7 per cent could both read and write; the per cent of literate females was as high as 89.4. The length of stay in the institution is as a general rule not long. Under the system of [[parole]] and [[probation]], the actual restraint is much shortened. The average duration of residence of 1508 boys discharged from the New York Catholic Protectory had been fifteen and two-thirds months; of two hundred and fifty girls, thirty-two and one-half months. The management of the Protectory claim that the girls' department cannot be considered a reformatory or even a home for delinquent children, and express their satisfaction with the recent amendment of the law in New York to prohibit the conviction of children under sixteen years of age of crime as such, restricting the complaint to delinquency. 

At [[St-Yon]], in France, in the first quarter of the eighteenth century, [[St. John Baptiste de la Salle]] undertook the training and correction of wayward youth. The methods which are now employed at the New York Catholic Protectory, which is under the care of the order established by him, can be taken as indicative of the general plan of protectories or the ideals which they seek to attain. The Protectory aims to form the youth committed to its care by vigilance, good example and instruction: vigilance, to remove from the children the many occasions of offending; example, that the teachers be exemplars of the virtues they inculcate, for example is much better than precept; instruction, that they may become intelligent scholars, not only in the secular sciences but in religion, which is the warmth that gives life and light to all other learning, without which there is danger that knowledge may but minister to evil. Many of the boys received have been truant players with a strong disinclination to study. To overcome this and to train and develop the receptive faculties in the usual school studies entails much labour upon the Brothers. Moreover, it is felt that for these children especially vocational studies should not be postponed until mature years, but should be commenced early, so as to accustom the boy to what may afterwards prove to be the means of earning his own livelihood when he shall have left the Protectory. Accordingly, the effective faculties are instructed in different industries, in printing in all its branches, photography, tailoring, shoemaking, laundry work, industrial and ornamental drawing, sign-painting, painting, wheel-wrighting, blacksmithing, plumbing, carpentry, bricklaying, stone-work, baking in its different branches, and in practical knowledge of boilers, engines, dynamos and electric wiring. 

At the Lincoln Agricultural School, a subsidiary institution, the boys also receive a training in dairy-farming and other agriculture. It was felt that if these children should not acquire a taste for the farm and for husbandry, but should return later to the city, they will have passed the trying period of their lives under conditions that will help them to be good men and assist them in health and in many other ways in after-life. While the productivity of these protectories is sometimes considerable, this is not the aim, but simply incidental to their primary object, which is the development of an industrious boy of good character for the glory of God and the good of the country. Protectories are always desirous of allowing their inmates to go out into the world, if they are prepared for it. They are impressed with the truth in the statement of Archbishop Hughes in his letter of 19 June 1863, to Dr. Ives: "Let the children be in their house of protection just as short as possible. Their lot is, and is to be, in one sense, a sufficiently hard one under any circumstances, but the sooner they know what it is to be the better they will be prepared for encountering its trials and difficulties". These protectories have established working boys' homes, like St. Philip's of New York City, St. James' of Baltimore, the Working Boys' Home of Chicago, and other places, where the children may be safely housed and fed, taught manners, trained in the amenities of life, and somewhat accustomed to the use of money and economic conditions before they become incorporated in the great mass of citizenship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1713">A '''rough ASCII''', '''uncertified rough draft''', '''uncertified unedited rough draft''', '''realtime unedited rough draft''', '''uncertified copy''', or simply '''RASCII''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|s|k|i}} {{respell|RAS|kee}}) is the [[rough draft]] version of a [[transcript (law)|transcript]] created by a [[court reporter]], usually of a [[legal proceeding]].  It may have spelling errors as it has not yet been finalized.  Once the transcript has been finalized and certified by the [[court reporter]], the RASCII is then transformed into a so called "[[ASCII]]" ([[American Standard Code for Information Interchange]]).

A [[court reporter]] transcribes spoken or recorded speech into written form, using machine [[shorthand]] or [[voice writing]] equipment to produce official transcripts of court hearings, depositions and other official proceedings. If requested, the [[court reporter]] will go on to [[proofread]] and finalize the transcript before certifying it.  Frequently a "Rough" copy will be requested to review before the final copy is created.

The '''Royal Succession Act''' is an act of the [[Parliament of New Zealand|New Zealand parliament]] to alter the laws of succession to the New Zealand throne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/bills/00DBHOH_BILL11999_1/royal-succession-bill Royal Succession Act at the New Zealand Parliament's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to the Canadian [[Succession to the Throne Act, 2013]] which merely proposes to assent to the British [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]], this legislation effectively re-legislates the effects of the British act.

==Background==
{{main|Perth Agreement}}
On 28 October 2011, at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011|Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] held in [[Perth]], Western Australia, the heads of government of the 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s, which share [[Elizabeth II]] as head of state, announced that they would introduce legislation in all 16 countries to end the primacy of males over females and the disqualification of persons married to Catholic spouses in the succession to the Crown.&lt;ref name=bbcgirlsequal&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15492607| title=Girls equal in British throne succession| date=28 October 2011| publisher=BBC| accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to the other realms' heads of government, prior to the Perth Agreement, British Prime Minister David Cameron additionally proposed to limit the requirement to obtain the monarch's permission to marry to the first six people in line to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8822447/Royal-family-Cameron-begins-process-to-allow-first-born-daughters-to-accede-throne.html| title=Royal family: Cameron begins process to allow first born daughters to accede throne| date=12 October 2011| newspaper=The Telegraph| accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
[[Monarchy New Zealand]] welcomed the Bill, stating "The much-needed changes to the royal succession will remove gender discrimination by allowing women equal right to the throne."&lt;ref name=aap&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/breaking-news/nz-joins-line-of-succession-law-change/story-e6freoo6-1226580305415|title=Royal change could put a girl on top|date=18 February 2013|accessdate=26 February 2013|publisher=AAP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand]] described the changes as "too little, too late"&lt;ref name=aap /&gt; and was critical of the continuation of the rule preventing Catholics being monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.republic.org.nz/media/media-release-succession-changes-too-little-too-late-monarchy|title=Succession changes too little too late for monarchy|date=18 February 2013|accessdate=27 February 2013|publisher=[[Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clauses==

The bill's provisions are to implement in New Zealand law changes to the succession agreed to at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011|2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]]. Specifically it:
* provides for the succession of the Crown to be determined without regard to the sex of those born after 29 October 2011
* abolishes the exclusion from the throne of those who marry Roman Catholics
* repeals the [[Royal Marriages Act]] and substitutes a requirement that the first six individuals in line to the throne obtain the consent of the Sovereign to marry
* validates certain marriages that occurred in violation of the Royal Marriages Act.

To implement those provisions, the bill provides for amending the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and the [[Imperial Laws Application Act 1988]] in so far as they apply in New Zealand.

== Bill stages ==
The Bill was introduced into Parliament on 18 February 2013, by Minister of Justice [[Judith Collins]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2013/0099/latest/versions.aspx|title=Royal Succession Act 2013|publisher=Public Access to Legislation|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it passed its first reading on 2 July 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Debates/Debates/1/7/0/50HansD_20130702_00000040-Royal-Succession-Bill-First-Reading.htm|title=Hansard - Royal Succession Bill First Reading|publisher=[[Parliament of New Zealand]]|date=3 July 2013|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 104 votes in favour and 15 abstentions. It was then referred to the Justice and Electoral Committee, which reported on 31 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2013/0099/latest/versions.aspx|title=Bill stages|author=[[Parliament of New Zealand]]|accessdate=7 December 2013|date=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its second and third readings were on 10 December 2013. Royal assent was given on 17 December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/bills/00DBHOH_BILL11999_1/royal-succession-bill NZ Parliament]&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was brought into force on 26 March 2015, in concert with Her Majesty's other realms.&lt;ref name=NZorder&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2015/0054/latest/whole.html?search=y_regulation_2015__rc%40rinf%40rnif_an%40bn%40rn_25_y&amp;p=1#DLM6416907| author=Governor General of New Zealand=in-Council| title=Royal Succession Act Commencement Order 2015| date=25 March 2015| publisher=Queen's Printer| location=Wellington| accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SS ''Wairuna''''', originally called '''D/S ''Schneefels''''', then '''SS ''Gibraltar''''' and '''SS ''Polescar''''', was a cargo steamship that was launched in Germany in 1913. She had a varied career spanning three decades under successive German, British and New Zealand owners before being scuttled in the North Atlantic in 1945.

{{stack|[[File:DDG „Hansa“ house flag.svg|thumb|[[DDG Hansa]] [[Maritime flag#House flag|house flag]]]]}}

==Building==
The ship was built by [[Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft]]&lt;ref name=LR30/&gt; of [[Flensburg]], [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]]. She was launched on 13 November 1913 and completed on 1 January 1914.&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; She had nine corrugated furnaces with a combined grate area of {{convert|148|sqft|0}} that heated three 185 [[Pounds per square inch|lb&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] single-ended boilers with a combined heating surface of {{convert|6956|sqft|0}}.&lt;ref name=LR30/&gt;

The ship was launched as D/S ''Schneefels'' for the [[DDG Hansa|Deutsche Dampfschiffahrts-Gesellschaft Hansa]] (DDG Hansa). D/S stands for ''Dampfschiff'', just as "SS" stands for "Steamship" in English. DDG Hansa gave many of its ships names ending in ''-fels'' ("rock"), (''e.g.'' [[SS Freienfels|D/S ''Freienfels'']], [[SS Uhenfels|D/S ''Uhenfels'']], [[SMS Wolf (auxiliary cruiser)|D/S ''Wachtfels'']]), so that collectively they became known as the "Fels ships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Christian |editor1-last=Leysen |editor2-first=Olivier |editor2-last=Boehme |year=2009 |chapter=The DDG Hansa, 1881–1980—a missed centenary |title=100 Years Ahlers in Antwerp: A family business in a world port |location=Brussels |publisher=ASP/University Press Antwerp |isbn=978-90-5487-654-0 |page=24 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eJZUg4dCDhsC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=DDG+Hansa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mehbCts6TU&amp;sig=vi453akiFsqNI52vIHKf627IpLI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=crtGULSjFKrtigKp-YHgAw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=seventeen%20companies%20from%20Bremen&amp;f=false |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August 1914, a week after the outbreak of the First World War, ''Schneefels'' was in the Mediterranean a mile off [[Europa Point]] when the [[Royal Navy]] captured her and took her to [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; She was judged to be a [[Prize (law)|prize ship]] and was renamed ''Gibraltar''.&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; She was posted to [[Moudros]] in the [[Aegean Sea]] where she served as a [[Combat stores ship|store ship]] until 1915.&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; From then until 1916 she served as a water carrier in the eastern Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt;

In August 1916 the ship was returned to general cargo duties. She remained in UK Government ownership but was placed under the management of [[Houlder Line|Houlder, Middleton and Company]] and renamed ''Polescar''.&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; In 1917 her management was transferred to G Heyn and Sons of [[Belfast]].&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; On 14 March 1917 she was northwest of Ireland when an enemy submarine on the surface chased her, but she outran it.&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; On 25 September 1917 she was unloading at [[Dunkirk]], France when she was caught in an air raid. A German bomb hit her and killed two people.&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; On 5 August 1918 she was in the English Channel en route from [[Montreal]] to [[Le Havre]].&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; About {{convert|30|mi}} southwest of [[St Catherine's Point]] she was damaged by a torpedo fired by the [[German Type UC II submarine|German submarine]] [[SM UC-71|SM ''UC-71'']], but ''Polescar''{{'}}s crew managed to beach the ship to prevent her from sinking.&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt;

==Between the wars==
The [[British-India Steam Navigation Company]] bought her in January 1919 but sold her the next month for £146,000 to the [[Union Company|Union Steam Ship Company]] of New Zealand.&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt;
The Union Line renamed her ''Wairuna'',&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; which had been the name of a cargo ship sunk by the German [[auxiliary cruiser]] {{SMS|Wolf|auxiliary cruiser|6}} in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?172408 |title=SS Wairuna [+1917] |last=Lettens |first=Jan |date=6 February 2012 |work=The Wreck Site |publisher= |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 the Union Company had her converted to carry oil cargo in her [[double bottom]]s.&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; On 5 August 1925 ''en route'' from [[San Francisco]] to New Zealand ''Wairuna'' ran out of coal {{convert|550|mi}} north of [[Auckland]].&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; She had radioed distress messages and was rescued by another Union Company ship, the ''Waihemo''.&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt;

On 4 February 1933, a day after leaving [[Newcastle, New South Wales]], ''Wairuna'' lost a blade from her propeller.&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; She completed her voyage to Auckland on its remaining blades.&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; On 2 March 1936 she collided with Glasgow Wharf at [[Napier, New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; Wharf piles were damaged but the ship was unharmed.&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; On 8 February 1937 she was in San Francisco when fire broke out in her cargo of [[copra]].&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; The ship was extensively damaged, with some buckling of her plates.&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt;

==Second World War and after==
During the Second World War ''Wairuna'' continued in merchant service in the Pacific. In 1945 the Union Company sold her to the UK [[Ministry of War Transport|MoWT]].&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; The MoWT appointed [[Denholm Group|J&amp;J Denholm]] to manage her,&lt;ref name=LR45/&gt; and she served as a store ship on the [[River Clyde]].&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; On 5 August 1945 she was at [[Greenock]] when a fire destroyed much of her upperworks.&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt;

In October 1945 ''Wairuna''{{'}}s hulk was loaded with 8,432 tons of unused chemical ammunition&lt;ref name=Kiehlmann/&gt; and on 30 October she was [[Scuttling|scuttled]] in the North Atlantic beyond the [[continental shelf]], 120 [[nautical mile]]s (138 miles; 222&amp;nbsp;km) northwest of [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name=P&amp;O/&gt; Her wreck is at {{coord|55|30|N|11|00|W}} in {{convert|8200|ft|m}} of water.&lt;ref name=MoD&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowles |first=R |date= |title=British Isles Explosive Dumping Grounds |location=London |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Wairuna'' was one of four redundant cargo ships that the [[Admiralty]] used to dispose of chemical ammunition in the same area of the North Atlantic in 1945. The others were {{SS|Empire Simba}} on 11 September, {{SS|Empire Cormorant}} on 1 October, and {{SS|Lambridge}} on 30 December.&lt;ref name=MoD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?152796 |title=Pentridge Hill SS (1936~1939) Lambridge SS [+1945] |last1=Lettens |first1=Jan |last2=Allen |first2=Tony |date=27 December 2010 |work=The Wreck Site |publisher= |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) Concerning Conservation, Restoration and Sustainable Use of the Saiga Antelope ''' is a Multilateral Environmental [[Memorandum of Understanding]] and came into effect on 24 September 2006 under the auspices of the [[Bonn Convention|Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS)]], also known as the [[Bonn Convention]]. The MoU covers five range States (Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Russian Federation, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan), all of which have signed. A number of cooperating organizations have also signed the MoU.

== Development of MoU ==
To implement the decision of the Seventh Conference of the Parties of CMS to list the [[Saiga Antelope]] ''(Saiga tatarica)'' on Appendix II of the Convention as a consequence of its endangered status and the conviction that conservation efforts of this species are dependent on international collaboration between the range States, an Article IV agreement was concluded and took effect on 24 September 2006 after signature by the third range State. 
[[File:014 Bazhanov signing.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Signing of the Saiga Antelope MoU by the Russian Federation|Signing of the Saiga Antelope MoU by the Russian Federation, 24 June 2009]]
[[File:Signing of the Saiga Antelope MoU by Uzbekistan.JPG|thumb|200px|Signing of the Saiga Antelope MoU by Uzbekistan, 23 May 2006]]
Signatories to the Saiga Antelope MoU:
* 	Turkmenistan (23 November 2005)
* 	Uzbekistan (23 May 2006)
* 	Kazakhstan (24 September 2006)
* 	Russian Federation (24 June 2009)
*	Mongolia (10 September 2010)

In addition, the following organizations have signed the MoU:
* 	[[UNEP]]/CMS Secretariat (23 November 2005)
* 	Ministry of Nature and Environment of Mongolia (23 November 2005)
* 	[[International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation]] (23 November 2005)
* 	[[IUCN]]/SSC (23 November 2005)
* 	[[WWF (conservation organization)|WWF International]] (23 November 2005)
* 	[[Fauna and Flora International]] (24 September 2006)
* 	[[Frankfurt Zoological Society]] (24 September 2006)
* 	[[Wildlife Conservation Society]] (24 September 2006)
* 	Association for the Conservation of Biodiversity of Kazakhstan (10 September 2010)
* 	[[Saiga Conservation Alliance|The Saiga Conservation Alliance]] (10 September 2010)

== Aim of MoU==
Since the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Saiga populations declined by more than 95% (scientists estimate that only 64,400-69,400 Saigas remain from a former population of nearly 2 million), primarily due to poaching for the species’ meat and horn and Chinese traditional medice.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cms.int/species/saiga/saiga_bkrd.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Being one of the fastest population collapses of large mammals recently observed, the MoU aims to reduce current exploitation levels and restore the population status of these nomads of the Central Asian steppes.

== Species covered by MoU ==
Until 2002 only the sub-species ''Saiga tatarica tatarica'' was listed on the CMS Appendix II and thus the scope of the MoU was limited to this sub-species. In 2008 however, all ''Saiga spp.'' were listed on Appendix II and at the Second Meeting of Signatories the species coverage of the MoU was extended to the entire species.&lt;ref&gt;CMS Species list: {{cite web |url=http://www.cms.int/pdf/en/CMS_Species_6lng.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324081939/http://www.cms.int/pdf/en/CMS_Species_6lng.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of Signatories to the Saiga Antelope MoU.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of Signatories to the Saiga Antelope MoU, as of 15 August 2012]]

== Fundamental components ==
All Signatories agree to collaborate to improve the conservation status of the Saiga antelope throughout its range, and undertake national and joint activities to conserve restore and sustainably use the species and those habitats and ecosystems important for its long-term survival. Therefore, they shall, individually or collectively:&lt;ref&gt;Text Saiga Antelope Memorandum of Understanding: http://www.cms.int/species/saiga/_Saiga_MoU_Eng_amended_10Sept2010_with_sig.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

# 	Provide effective protection for the Saiga antelope and, where feasible and appropriate, conserve, restore and sustainably use those habitats and ecosystems that are important for its long-term survival
# 	Implement the provisions of the Action Plan, adopted in 2006
# 	Assess regularly the implementation of the Saiga antelope MoU and the Action Plan
# 	Facilitate the exchange of scientific, technical and legal information to undertake coordinated measures to conserve, restore and sustainably use the Saiga antelope, and cooperate with other States, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and other bodies interested in the implementation process
# 	Provide to the CMS Secretariat detailed reports on the implementation of the MoU

The MoU took effect immediately after at least three of the range States signed it (24 September 2006) and shall remain in effect indefinitely subject to the right of any Signatory to terminate its participation by providing one year’s written notice to all of the other Signatories.

== Meetings ==

=== Meeting of Signatories ===
Meetings of Signatories are organized regularly to review the conservation status of the Saiga antelope and the implementation of the MoU and Action Plan. National reports by individual Signatories and a report prepared by the Secretariat are also submitted.

'''The First Meeting of Signatories ''' took place in [[Almaty, Kazakhstan]], 25–26 September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Report First Meeting of Signatories: http://www.cms.int/species/saiga/report_mtg1/_Report_1st_Saiga_Meeting_with_annexes_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous to the meeting a two-day Technical Workshop was organized. During the First Meeting of Signatories the following points were addressed:

* 	Share information on the conservation status of the Saiga antelope within the respective range States and the status of implementation of the Action Plan
* 	Adopt a Medium Term International Work Programme to support the implementation of the MoU and Action Plan

The Signatories represented at the meeting were Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. The other two range States, the Russian Federation and Mongolia, were also represented. Additionally, China and the United States were also present. Finally, a number of organizations such as [[UNDP]] Kazakhstan, [[NABU]] and [[TRAFFIC]] attended the meeting.

'''The Second Meeting of Signatories ''' was convened by CMS and took place in [[Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia]], 7–10 September 2010, preceded by a technical meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Report Second Meeting of Signatories: http://www.cms.int/species/saiga/2ndMtg_Mongolia/Mtg_Rpt/Report_SA_2nd_Meeting_E_with_annexes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The Meeting of Signatories:

* 	Adopted a Medium Term International Work Programme for 2011-2015
* 	Agreed to expand the MoU to cover all Saigas, and thus to amend its title to refer to ''“Saiga spp.”'' instead of only ''“Saiga tatarica tatarica”''. This meant that Mongolia became a formal Range State to the MoU and its signature was welcomed

The Signatories represented at the meeting were Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation and Mongolia. China as well as a number of organizations such as [[IUCN]], [[CITES]] and [[IFAW]] also attended the meeting.

=== Other Saiga meetings ===
[[File:Workshop on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Saiga Antelope Urumqi.jpg|thumb|250px|Workshop on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Saiga Antelope Urumqi, China, 27–29 September 2010]]

From 27–29 September 2010 a Workshop on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Saiga Antelope was organized in [[Urumqi, China]].&lt;ref&gt;For summary of workshop see: http://www.cms.int/news/PRESS/nwPR2010/10_oct/Saiga_WorkShop_Urumqi_FINAL_REPORT_English.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The workshop focused on strengthening international cooperation among consumer and range States and provide a platform for discussion between the Asian traditional medicine industry and those managing conservation activities for the species.

From 17–18 February 2011 a Workshop on the Implementation and Coordination of the Saiga Antelope (Saiga spp.) Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and other CMS Instruments for Migratory Ungulates was held in [[Astana]], Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;Workshop report: http://www.cms.int/species/saiga/Other_Saiga_Mtgs/Workshop_Astana_KAZ_Feb2011/Meeting_Report_Eng_with_annexes_rev.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;   During this workshop priority activities for Saiga conservation in Kazakhstan were agreed and technical coordination arrangements for 2011 for the MoU with the Association for the Conservation of Biodiversity of Kazakhstan (ACBK)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acbk.kz/en/&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Saiga Conservation Alliance]] (SCA)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saiga-conservation.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  were confirmed.

== Secretariat ==
The CMS Secretariat – located in [[Bonn, Germany]] – acts as the secretariat to the MoU. One of the main tasks of the secretariat is to prepare an overview report compiled on the basis of information at its disposal pertaining to the Saiga antelope. Furthermore, the secretariat also acts as the Depositary.

== Action Plan and Medium Term International Work Programme ==
[[File:Saiga Antelope populations Map.jpg|thumb|500px|Saiga Antelope populations Map]]
The MoU includes a detailed '''Action Plan''', which was first developed in 2002 at a preparatory meeting in [[Elista]], Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;Action Plan: http://www.cms.int/species/saiga/Action_Plan_Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been drafted in consideration of biological, economic and social research, as well as practical information provided by a range of stakeholders and came into force in 2006. The Action Plan provides a road map to guide the implementation of conservation action for the Saiga antelope in the range States and in those countries which import Saiga products, such as the species’ horn. It has three main objectives:

* 	Restore populations to ecologically and biologically appropriate levels throughout the species’ range [[File:Saiga tatarica.jpg|thumb|200px|Saiga Antelope ''(Saiga tatarica'')]]
* 	Restoring the range and habitats of Saiga antelopes to optimal levels
* 	Enhance transboundary and international cooperation to conserve and sustainably use Saigas

To reach these objectives activities focus on:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cms.int/species/saiga/saiga_bkrd.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

* 	Improved monitoring of the status of individual populations, including participatory monitoring with local people
* 	Application of the same recommended monitoring methodology throughout range States
* 	Assessment of species’ distribution, spatial and temporal variation in breeding pastures and migratory routes
* 	Reduction and control of Saiga poaching
* 	Creation of alternative livelihood options in rural villages that depend on poaching for income and employment; creation of incentives for conservation at local level
* 	Awareness raising (regional, national and international levels)
* 	Improvement of the protected area network, focusing on birth and rutting areas and including transboundary protection areas
* 	Application of captive breeding where appropriate; knowledge transfer on techniques
* 	Reduction and control of illegal trade in Saiga products; compliance with CITES provisions
* 	Assessment of long-term conservation solutions, including sustainable use if populations have recovered to a level that would allow for such use

'''The Medium Term International Work Programme (MTIWP)''' is the primary road map for conservation actions under the Saiga antelope MoU and is regularly updated. It is this work programme which is used to implement the MoU and to review progress; it reflects the highest priorities for action for a period of five years in order to support the Action Plan’s implementation. The MTIWP for 2007-2011 was adopted at the first Meeting of Signatories in 2006;&lt;ref&gt;Medium Term International Work Programme 2007-2011: http://www.cms.int/species/saiga/report_mtg1/Annex_09_MediumTerm_Int_WrkProgm_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the MTIWP for 2011-2015 was adopted at the second Meeting of Signatories in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Medium Term International Work Programme 2011-2015: http://www.cms.int/species/saiga/2ndMtg_Mongolia/Mtg_Rpt/Annex_5_MTIWP_2011_2015_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Altyn Dala Conservation Initiative ==
[[File:Locations of the Saiga Antelope in Kazakhstan (1970-2008).jpg|thumb|400px|Saiga Antelope locations in Kazakhstan (1970-2008)]]
The Altyn Dala Conservation Initiative (ADCI) is a large scale programme to conserve the northern steppe and semi desert ecosystems and their [[Critically Endangered]] species like the Saiga antelope. The ADCI is an initiative of the Kazakh Committee of Forestry and Hunting (CFH) of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Environment Protection and is implemented by the Association for the Conservation of Biodiversity of Kazakhstan (ACBK) in partnership with the Frankfurt Zoological Society (FZS)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zgf.de/?id=14&amp;language=de&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds|Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB)]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rspb.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme started in 2006, uses an ecosystem approach and focuses on an area of about 55 million hectares. The main objectives are:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saigak.biodiversity.ru/eng/publications/saiganewseng7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* 	Address the main threats to the future viability of the Betpak-dala Saiga population and its habitats, such as poaching as well as habitat conversion and fragmentation
* 	Establish a network of protected areas of various categories and corridors to conserve the migration routes and habitats of Saigas
*	Identify and put in place key enabling conditions such as the genuine involvement of local communities and other relevant stakeholders, as well as ensuring tangible contributions to people’s livelihoods and rural development
* 	Gather baseline understanding of the Kazakh steppe and semi desert ecosystems and their species in order to inform the planning and implementation of these conservation measures
* 	Raise awareness and understanding for steppe and Saiga conservation nationally and internationally

One of the biggest achievements to date is the improvement of the population status of the Betpak-Dala Saiga population, which increased more than fourfold since 2006 as a result of joint efforts of the Kazakhstan government, the ADCI and its partners – from estimated 18,600 individuals in 2006 to estimated 78,000 individuals in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://zgf.de/?id=132&amp;language=de&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this good news, the Kazakh Saiga population is still at risk. In 2010 about 15 percent of the Saiga antelope population (around 12,000 individuals) died by an outbreak of pasteurellosis, a disease affecting the lungs, within a 4,500 hectare area of western Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/kazakhstan/7779374/Saiga-antelope-population-drops-by-15-per-cent-due-to-disease.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cooperation with other organizations ==
In 1995 the Saiga antelope was included in Appendix II of the '''[[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)]]''' to primarily address the illegal trade in Saiga horn. Since one of the main conservation needs is to reduce and control poaching of the species for their meat and horn, CMS and CITES closely collaborate to address both Saiga population management and illegal trade in order to contribute towards the international conservation of this flagship species of the Eurasian steppes. In the Joint Work Programme between CMS and CITES for the period 2012-2014, the Saiga species are one of the target groups for joint activities.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Work Programme between CMS and CITES: {{cite web |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/com/SC/62/E62-14-03.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704013724/http://www.cites.org/eng/com/sc/62/E62-14-03.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To coordinate communication, the newsletter '''Saiga News ''' was launched in 2005 by the [[Saiga Conservation Alliance]]. It is published bi-annually in English and Range State languages and can be accessed through the Saiga Conservation Alliance website.&lt;ref&gt;Saiga News:http://www.saiga-conservation.com/saiga_news.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salic patrimony''' (or ''inheritance'' or ''land property'', after the legal term ''Terra salica'' used in the [[Salic law|Salian code]]) refers to [[clan]]-based possession of [[real estate]] property, particularly in [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] context. ''Terra salica'' could not be sold or otherwise disposed; it was not [[alienable]].   

In Salic patrimony, the clan demesne is divided between male agnatic heirs, as often (but not necessarily) is also  succession to supreme chieftainship of the clan within an agnatic extended family only upon entrusting the common domain to one of the agnates. 

It has been observed{{whom|date=March 2015}}{{year needed|date=March 2015}} that "Salic patrimony" is the usual pattern of landholding in most [[tribal society|tribal societies]]. In [[Kent]], a comparable practice survived into the [[Norman England|Norman period]] under the name ''[[Gavelkind]]''.

==Characteristics of the practice==
Lands belonged to the entire clan or house, which was a composition of [[agnatic]] relatives. Real estate (in medieval West-European society, that sort of property was often called [[demesne]]) meant landed property, which was basically a farm, but may have been larger territory, even a kingdom. [[Royal domain]]s in several countries were such properties. To usual medieval feudal power structure, the actual holding of royal domain manors, fortresses and arable lands was the stronghold to exercise governmental control over surrounding areas. Partitions of such properties thus meant practical sharing of areas of influence and control over territories, thus creating partitioned kingdoms and fiefs.

When a father died, all his sons were entitled to receive a share of real estate. When a holder died sonless, the clan, which means his agnatic relatives, succeeded in the possession of his lands. Share of the family demesne, share in its possession, was a birthright of males born in male line to the "clan".

This pattern, sort of [[partible inheritance]] but only between male heirs, was inherent in archaic societies, such as in Germanic tribes of [[early medieval]] period. It however sometimes continued in one or another form in [[feudal]] societies too, and even early modern states.

For example, in 11th and 12th centuries, the [[Kingdom of Norway (872–1397)]] was several times partitioned between males of the reigning dynasty. At the time, the Kingdom of Norway was looked upon as a property of the king. As such it would be divided among his heirs, like any other private estate under [[Ancient Norwegian property laws]]. The first such partition between brothers took place in 1067 when [[Olav III of Norway]], returning from England, demanded his younger brother [[Magnus II of Norway]] to cede him his portion of the kingdom. Magnus was to rule the northern half of the country and Olav the southern. This division is the beginning of a long series of partitions of the kingdom between the sons and heirs of the ruling king. 

The [[Kingdom of Franks]] was partitioned during both [[Merovingian]] and [[Carolingian]] dynasties. A permanent future division took place in 842, when three sons of late [[Emperor Louis I]] partitioned the royal lands in Verdun, thus creating the division between [[France]] and [[Germany]].

Often this inheritance pattern of division clashed with other, more [[centralize]]d needs: a clan, [[tribe]] or people needed a chieftain to lead them. If and when one of agnates was elected to chieftaincy, the pattern of Salic patrimony meant that he held the clan property on behalf of the whole agnatic kin, and:

# was not entitled to decide its fate unilaterally
# was to be succeeded by other agnates, not by just anyone such as a relative related through a female line or a legatee of [[will (law)|testament]]

The usual preferential order of succession to [[Germanic chieftain|chieftainship]] was to the next brother of a chief. And generally, to an experienced (but not too elderly) agnate of the clan, which basically favored seniority until lifespans grew longer, even to feebleness and infirmity, in average.

In elective monarchies, this led to custom that it was not necessary to choose the eldest brother to the throne, that each agnate (for example, any of the sons of a previous monarch) was almost as possible successor. Germanic-descending peoples had such customs long into modern era, despite of primogeniture having been officially adopted.

The possession mode of Salic Patrimony however was the regular and protected form of succession to various fiefs (such as counties, duchies, margraviates, landgraviates) of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Its original fiefs became partitioned a number of times throughout the history, until in around 16th-18th centuries, these changed mostly to primogenitural succession. This partitioning was one of chief reasons behind why Germany had become so filled with "independent" petty states (rather, petty monarchies) until the beginning of 19th century.

==Impact on other inheritance practices==
Much later, in some circumstances, succession of chieftainship, headship of the clan, changed into [[primogeniture]]. When this happened, Salic patrimony pattern usually meant strict use of so-called [[Salic Law]] succession, the one to preserve all agnates' rights over any females.

When rulers of petty principalities of Holy Roman Empire changed, one at a time, during 16th-18th centuries their succession system into primogeniture, it has been reported by research that each such change was specifically accepted by the emperor, because such change violated the rights of the junior males of these petty dynasties and was basically against the original understanding of the fief's inheritance law. In cases of arrangements inside a dynasty, the Imperial Court had the task to protect the birthrights of underaged and possibly those of unborn or otherwise potential heirs. Also in several cases, the changes were adopted by a pact between agnates of the birthrighted house, all of them accepting. Later, when the Empire had been dissolved, in many cases changes of succession laws of states originating from the Empire, for example when allowing for Semi-Salic succession, dynastifying a morganatic relative or ceding some territories, were deemed to require the consent of all agnates of the house.

Notions of this patrimony and shared inheritance are present in much-later legal positions of dynasts, after the actual partitioning custom had already ended centuries earlier. From documentation and behavior, royal princes of France in, for example, 18th century regarded the throne as their common property, common inheritance, which was entrusted to the senior dynast of them, who therefore was king of France. The same princes each were regarded to have some sovereignty already, being eligible to succeed to the throne, and it was shown by their titles and prerogatives.

The '''Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council''' was the inaugural governing body for the [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC) territory of [[Southern Rhodesia]] (today Zimbabwe) before its replacement by the [[Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly]] in 1923, when the country achieved [[responsible government]], and duly became a [[self-governing colony]] within the [[British Empire]].

The Council was established on 20 October 1898, and the [[Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council election, 1899|first election]] for the Council was held on 17 April 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Willson, F. (1963) ''Source Book of Parliamentary Elections and Referenda in Southern Rhodesia 1898-1962'', Department of Government, University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Salisbury.&lt;/ref&gt; The Council sat for the first time in May 1899. Initially, the Council consisted of four elected members and five members nominated by the British South Africa Company, with the BSAC administrator presiding (and who also holding the right of veto over any legislation).&lt;ref name=Berens&gt;Berens, D. (1988) ''A Concise Encyclopedia of Zimbabwe'', Mambo Press, Gweru.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a British resident commissioner sat on the Council as a non-voting member.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen&gt;Kent Rasmussen, R. &amp; Rubert, S. (1990) ''Historical Dictionary of Zimbabwe'', The Scarecrow Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Qualifications for members and franchise were set by the commissioner, who required voters to be British subjects, male, 21 years of age and older, able to write their address and occupation, and then to fulfil any one of the following financial requirements:
{{plainlist|
*:(a) ownership of a registered mining claim in Southern Rhodesia
*:(b) six months' continuous residence in Southern Rhodesia, and the occupation there of immovable property worth at least [[pound sterling|£]]75 (about (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|75|1899|2012|r=0}}}} in today's money{{Inflation-fn|UK|name=inflation}})
*:(c) six months' continuous residence in Southern Rhodesia, and the receipt there of wages or salary worth at least £50 per annum (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|50|1899|2012|r=0}}}} per annum today{{Inflation-fn|UK|name=inflation}}).}}

All voters were entered onto a common roll.

Due to continuing pressure by white settlers for a greater role in the administration of the colony, the number of elected representatives on the Council was [[History and evolution of the Rhodesian premiership|gradually increased]], so that by 1920 there were 13 elected members.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen/&gt;

The main issue debated in the Legislative Council by the 1910s was the future of Southern Rhodesia following the planned end of BSAC rule.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen/&gt; When responsible government was granted to Southern Rhodesia in 1923, the Legislative Council was replaced by the Legislative Assembly.&lt;ref name=Berens/&gt; Under the 1924 Constitution, there was provision for the establishment of an [[upper house]] to be known as the Legislative Council, but none was ever established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1961/jun/22/southern-rhodesia Southern Rhodesia], ''[[Hansard]]'', HC Deb 22 June 1961 vol 642 cc1696-739&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Thirty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland''' (previously [[bill (law)|bill]] no. 87 of 2018) is an [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|amendment to the constitution of Ireland]] which removed the offence of publishing or uttering [[Blasphemy|blasphemous]] matter. An amendment to the constitution must be proposed in [[Dáil Éireann]], passed by both Houses of the [[Oireachtas]], and approved in a [[referendum]].

The bill was introduced to the Oireachtas on 13 July 2018 by the [[Government of the 32nd Dáil#31st Government of Ireland|Fine Gael minority coalition government]]. A referendum was held on 26 October, on the same date as the [[Irish presidential election, 2018|presidential election]].&lt;ref name="irishtimes230618"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/president-tells-government-of-intention-to-seek-second-term-1.3540640|title=President tells Government of intention to seek second term|date=23 June 2018|access-date=21 July 2018|work=[[The Irish Times]]|first=Sarah|last=Bardon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second referendum on whether to remove an article referring to women’s place in the home, originally scheduled for the same date, was postponed until 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McMorrow |first1=Conor |title=Referendum on place of women in the home deferred |url=https://www.rte.ie/news/politics/2018/0905/991714-women-in-the-place-referendum/ |access-date=5 September 2018 |work=RTÉ News|date=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendment was approved by nearly 65% of the voters, with approval from every constituency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.electionsireland.org/results/referendum/refresult.cfm?ref=201837R|title=Elections Ireland: Referendum 26 October 2018 Repeal of Blasphemy Offence|last=|first=|date=|website=www.electionsireland.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Blasphemy law in the Republic of Ireland}}
The publication or utterance of blasphemous matter is an offence specified by the [[Constitution of Ireland]] as an exception to general guarantee of the right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions. In ''Corway v Independent Newspapers'' (1999), the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]] held that the common law crime of [[blasphemous libel]] related to an [[state religion|established church]] and could not have survived the enactment of the Constitution. They also held that it was impossible to say what the offence of blasphemy consisted of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Corway v Independent Newspapers |court=IESC |year=1999 |num=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offence of publishing or uttering blasphemous matter was first defined in Irish law in the [[Blasphemy law in the Republic of Ireland#Defamation Act 2009|Defamation Act 2009]]. Someone is guilty of the offence if they publish or utter "matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion, thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion", and they intend, "by the publication or utterance of the matter concerned, to cause such outrage". There is a broad defence where "a reasonable person would find genuine literary, artistic, political, scientific, or academic value in the matter to which the offence relates".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/31/section/36/enacted/en/html|title=Defamation Act 2009, Section 36|date=23 July 2009|access-date=21 July 2018|work=Irish Statute Book|publisher=Office of the Attorney General}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, there has not been a public prosecution for the offence of [[blasphemy]] in the Irish state.

The [[Constitutional Convention (Ireland)|Constitutional Convention]] held a session in November 2013, where they proposed replacing the offence of blasphemy in the Constitution with a prohibition on the incitement of religious hatred.

The matter came to public attention, in May 2017, when it was announced that English comedian [[Stephen Fry]], along with broadcaster [[RTÉ]], were under criminal investigation for blasphemy under the Act, following a complaint from a member of the public about comments made by Fry in a 2015 broadcast interviewed with veteran Irish broadcaster [[Gay Byrne]]. The case was dropped after the [[Garda Síochána|police]] confirmed that they had not been able to locate a sufficient number of offended people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/stephen-fry-blasphemy-probe-dropped-after-garda-fail-to-find-substantial-number-of-outraged-people-35692915.html||work=[[Irish Independent|the Irish Independent]]|title=Stephen Fry blasphemy probe dropped after gardaí fail to find 'substantial number of outraged people'|first=Cathal|last=McMahon|date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, [[Minister for Justice and Equality]] [[Charles Flanagan]] announced that the government would hold a referendum to simply remove the reference to the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR18000186|title=Minister Flanagan announces Government approval for the holding of a Referendum on the removal of the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution|date=12 June 2018|access-date=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed change to the Constitution==
The Thirty-seventh Amendment Bill proposes to amend the final sentence of paragraph i of subsection 1º of Article 40.6 by substituting "seditious"  for "blasphemous, seditious,".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/bill/2018/87/eng/initiated/b8718d.pdf|work=Houses of the Oireachtas|title=Thirty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution (Repeal of offence of publication or utterance of blasphemous matter) Bill 2018|date=13 July 2018|access-date=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DOT2015-02a/&gt; The text reads:

The proposed text reads: 
{{quote frame|The publication or utterance of seditious or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law.}}

==Proposed subsequent legislation==
If the referendum is passed, the [[Department of Justice and Equality]]'s draft general scheme for subsequent legislation proposes that the Government will then introduce a formal Bill to repeal sections 36 and 37 of the Defamation Act 2009, which deal with the 'Publication or utterance of blasphemous matter' and the 'Seizure of copies of blasphemous statements' respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/blasphemy-referendum-thirty-seventh-amendment-explained-4241301-Sep2018/|title=Explainer: What is the upcoming blasphemy referendum about?|work=TheJournal.ie|date=23 September 2018|access-date=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DOJE2018a/&gt; as well as to replace the words “indecent, obscene, or blasphemous” by “indecent or obscene” in the Censorship of Films Act 1923 as amended by the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008, and in the Censorship of Films (Amendment) Act 1925.&lt;ref name=DOJE2018a&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/GENERAL%20SCHEME%20OF%20THE%20REPEAL%20OF%20OFFENCE%20OF%20PUBLICATION%20OR%20UTTERANCE%20OF%20BLASPHEMOUS%20MATTER%20BILL%202018.pdf/Files/GENERAL%20SCHEME%20OF%20THE%20REPEAL%20OF%20OFFENCE%20OF%20PUBLICATION%20OR%20UTTERANCE%20OF%20BLASPHEMOUS%20MATTER%20BILL%202018.pdf|title=Draft of General Scheme of the Repeal of Offence of Publication or Utterance of Blasphemous Matter Act 2018|publisher=''[[Department of Justice and Equality]]''|year=2018|access-date=13 October 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passage through the Oireachtas==
The Bill was proposed by Minister Charlie Flanagan and passed all stage in the [[Dáil]] on 18 September and all stages of the [[Seanad]] on 20 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2018/87/?tab=debates|website=Houses of the Oireachtas|title=Thirty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution (Repeal of offence of publication or utterance of blasphemous matter) Bill 2018 (Bill 87 of 2018)|date=20 September 2018|access-date=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amendments by [[Solidarity (Ireland)|Solidarity]] to remove other religious references from the Constitution were ruled out of order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/2018-09-18/33/|website=Houses of the Oireachtas|title=Thirty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution (Repeal of offence of publication or utterance of blasphemous matter) Bill 2018: Committee and Remaining Stages|date=18 September 2018|access-date=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/bill/2018/87/dail/3/amendment/numberedList/eng/b8718d-dcnl.pdf|website=Houses of the Oireachtas|title=Thirty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution (Repeal of offence of publication or utterance of blasphemous matter) Bill 2018: Committee Amendments|date=17 September 2018|access-date=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was opposed in the Seanad by [[Rónán Mullen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/seanad/2018-09-20/9/|website=Houses of the Oireachtas|title=Thirty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution (Repeal of offence of publication or utterance of blasphemous matter) Bill 2018: Second Stage|date=20 September 2018|access-date=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==
A [[Referendum Commission]] to provide information to the public on the proposed amendment was established on 18 July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2018/si/255/made/en/print|work=Irish Statute Book|title=S.I. No. 255/2018 - Referendum Commission (Establishment) (No. 2) Order 2018|date=18 July 2018|access-date=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minister for [[Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government|Housing, Planning and Local Government]] [[Eoghan Murphy]] signed the electoral order for the referendum on 21 September, setting the polling date as 26 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/blasphemy-referendum-to-go-ahead-on-october-26th-as-minister-signs-order-1.3637229|title=Blasphemy referendum to go ahead on October 26th as Minister signs order|work=The Irish Times|access-date=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.housing.gov.ie/local-government/voting/referenda/thirty-seventh-amendment-constitution-repeal-offence-publication|title=Thirty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution (Repeal of offence of publication or utterance of blasphemous matter) Bill 2018|website=[[Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government]]|date=21 September 2018|access-date=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 17 October, there had been little public debate about the referendum, leading ''The Irish Times'' to suggest that this might cause most "Don't know" voters to end up voting "No" as had happened before in similar little-debated referendums, although it still expected the referendum to be carried based on the most recent opinion poll of 12 October.&lt;ref name=IT2018-10-17/&gt;

==Voting==
The referendum took place on 26 October 2018, on the same day as the [[Irish presidential election, 2018|presidential election]]. Polling stations were open from 7 am until 10 pm. Turnout was reported to be low in many areas of the country. By midday, turnout percentages from around the country were in the low teens, with many polling stations reporting single figure percentages. In Dublin some estimates suggested that turnout would be half that of the referendum on the [[Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2018/1026/1006764-presidential-elexblasphemy-ref/|title=Polls close in Presidential and referendum votes|first=Martina|last=Fitzgerald|date=26 October 2018|publisher=RTÉ News|access-date=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
''[[The Irish Times]]'''s analysis of its exit poll data said that "younger voters overwhelmingly backed deletion, while older voters were much more evenly split, with 48 per cent voting to retain the constitutional article as it currently stands".&lt;ref name=IT_2018-10-26/&gt;

RTÉ noted that given that the presidential election had received far more attention, it had been expected that there would be more abstainers than the 1.8% reported in its exit poll data.&lt;ref name=RTE_2018-10-26/&gt;

When analysing the Red C/RTÉ exit poll,&lt;ref name=RTE_2018-10-26/&gt; RTÉ Religious and Social Affairs Correspondent Joe Little said that older voters were less likely to vote 'Yes', with over 8 out of 10 voting 'Yes' among those aged under 44, 7 out of 10 among those aged under 45 to 64, and 6 out of 10 among those aged over 65.&lt;ref name=RTE2018-10-27b&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2018/1027/1007042-blasphemy/|title=Older voters less likely to back removal of blasphemy - poll|author=Joe Little, Religious &amp; Social Affairs Correspondent |date=27 October 2018|work=RTÉ News|access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for 'No' also increased in the lower [[NRS social grade|socio-economic groups]], with 77% of those in the top ABC1 group voting Yes, 70% of the C2DE group, and 63% of the bottom F group.&lt;ref name=RTE2018-10-27b/&gt; [[Sinn Féin]] voters were likeliest to vote ‘Yes’, followed by those voting [[Fine Gael]], [[Independent politician#Ireland|Independent]], [[Irish Labour Party|Labour]], and [[Fianna Fáil]].&lt;ref name=RTE2018-10-27b/&gt; Women and men were equally likely to vote 'Yes'.&lt;ref name=RTE2018-10-27b/&gt; 80% voted ‘Yes’ in [[Dublin Region|Dublin]], slightly over 70% in [[Munster]], and slightly under 70% in the rest of [[Leinster]], and in [[Connacht]] and the three border counties of [[Ulster]] ([[County Donegal|Donegal]], [[County Cavan|Cavan]],and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]]).&lt;ref name=RTE2018-10-27b/&gt; Only 69% said that "they understood the proposition to abolish the offence in the Constitution" (74% of ‘Yes’ voters, and 64% of ‘No’ voters).&lt;ref name=RTE2018-10-27b/&gt;

{{trade bloc}}
A '''trade agreement''' (also known as '''trade pact''') is a wide-ranging taxes, tariff and trade [[treaty]] that often includes [[investment]] guarantees. When two or more countries agree on terms that helps them trade with each other. The most common trade agreements are of the [[preferential trade arrangement|preferential]] and [[free trade area|free trade]] types are concluded in order to reduce (or eliminate) [[tariff]]s, [[Import quota|quotas]] and other [[trade barrier|trade restrictions]] on items [[trade]]d between the signatories. 


==Logic==
The logic of formal trade agreements is that they outline what is agreed upon and the punishments for deviation from the rules set in the agreement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Grossman |first=Gene M. |date=March 2016 |title=The Purpose of Trade Agreements |work=NBER Working Paper No. 22070 |doi=10.3386/w22070 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade agreements therefore make misunderstandings less likely, and create confidence on both sides that cheating will be punished; this increases the likelihood of long-term cooperation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An international organization, such as the IMF, can further incentivize cooperation by monitoring compliance with agreements and reporting third countries of the violations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Monitoring by international agencies may be needed to detect [[Non-tariff barriers to trade|non-tariff barriers]], which are disguised attempts at creating trade barriers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Classification of trade pacts==

===By number and type of signatories===
There are three different types of trade agreements. The first is ''unilateral'' trade agreement,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/unilateral-trade-agreements-definition-examples-3305904|title=See Why Afghan Rugs Cost You More Today Than a Year Ago|work=The Balance|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is what happens when a country wants certain restrictions to be enforced but no other countries want them to be imposed. This also allows countries to decrease the amount of [[trade restriction]]s. That is also something that does not happen often and could impair a country.

The second is classified as ''bilateral'' (BTA) when signed between two sides, where each side could be a country (or other [[customs territory]]), a [[trade bloc]] or an informal group of countries (or other customs territories). When both countries loosen their trade restrictions to help out businesses so that they can prosper better between the different countries this definitely helps lower taxes and it helps them converse about their trade status'. Usually this revolves around subsided domestic industries. Mainly

the industries fall under automotive, oil, or food industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/what-are-bilateral-trade-agreements-pros-cons-and-list-3305911|title=Top 12 U.S. Bilateral Trade Agreements|work=The Balance|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A trade agreement signed between more than two sides (typically neighboring or in the same region) is classified as ''multilateral''. this one is the hardest to work out. Usually involves three or more countries. With the more countries that are involved it's definitely harder to negotiate. They are also more difficult to deal with because each country has their own set of things that they need and or want. Once this type of trade agreement is settled on it becomes a very powerful agreement. It covers a bigger area of the world. The largest multilateral trade agreement is the North American Free Trade Agreement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/facts-about-nafta-statistics-and-accomplishments-3306280|title=Fast Facts About the World's Largest Trade Agreement|work=The Balance|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; between United States, Canada, and Mexico are the three countries involved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/multilateral-trade-agreements-pros-cons-and-examples-3305949|title=5 Pros and 4 Cons to the World's Largest Trade Agreements|work=The Balance|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. regional trade agreements ===
These are between countries in a certain area. The most powerful ones include a few countries that are near each other in a geographical area.&lt;ref name="The Balance"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/u-s-regional-trade-agreements-3306275|title=What Trade Agreements Do We Have With Our Neighbors?|work=The Balance|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries usually have similar histories, demographics and even economic goals.

[[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) January 1, 1989 was when it was put into effect, this is between United States, Canada, and Mexico this agreement was designed to get rid of tariff barriers between the separate countries.

Regional trade agreements are very hard to establish and commit to when the countries are more diverse.

[[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]](ASEAN) this was formed in 1967 between the countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand the reasoning was so that they could engage political and economic encouragement and it helps them all keep regional stability.&lt;ref name="The Balance"/&gt;

===By level of integration===
{{world economic integration}}

There are a variety of trade agreements; with some being quite complex ([[European Union]]), while others are less intensive ([[North American Free Trade Agreement]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting level of [[economic integration]] depends on the specific type of trade pacts and policies adopted by the [[trade bloc]]:

# Separate
#* [[Trade and Investment Framework Agreement]] (TIFA)
#* [[Bilateral Investment Treaty]] (BIT)
#* [[Preferential Trade Arrangement]] (PTA)–limited scope and depth of tariffs reduction between the [[customs territory|customs territories]].
#** [[Free Trade Agreement]] establishing a Free Trade Area (FTA)–extensive reduction or elimination of tariffs on substantially all trade allowing for the [[free movement of goods|free movement]] of [[Good (economics)|goods]] and in more advanced agreements also reduction of restrictions on [[investment]] and establishment allowing for the [[free movement of capital|free movement]] of [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[free movement of services|free movement]] of [[Service (economics)|services]]
#*** [[Common market]]–FTA with significantly reduced or eliminated restrictions on the [[freedom of movement]] of all [[factors of production]], including [[free movement of workers|free movement]] of [[labour (economics)|labour]] and of [[capitalism|enterprise]]; and coordination in [[economic policy]]
#* [[Currency union]]–sharing the same [[currency]]
# Composite
#* [[Customs union]]–FTA with [[common external tariff]]s of all signatories in respect to non-signatory countries
#** [[Customs and monetary union]]–Customs union with Currency union
#** [[Economic union]]–Customs union with Common market
#*** [[Economic and monetary union]] (EMU)–Economic union with Currency Union
#**** [[Fiscal Union]]–common coordination of substantial parts of the [[fiscal policy|fiscal policies]] ''(proposed step between EMU and [[Complete economic integration]])''

===Special agreements===
* [[World Trade Organization]] treaty
** [[List of free trade agreements#World Trade Organization agreements|agreements in the WTO framework]] (Textile Agreement and others)
* the now defunct [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] framework)

===By the World Trade Organization===
Typically the benefits and obligations of the trade agreements apply only to their signatories.

In the framework of the [[World Trade Organization]], different agreement types are concluded (mostly during new member accessions), whose terms apply to all [[WTO accession and membership|WTO members]] on the so-called [[Most favoured nation|most-favored]] basis (MFN), which means that beneficial terms agreed bilaterally with one trading partner will apply also to the rest of the WTO members.

All agreements concluded outside of the WTO framework (and granting additional benefits beyond the WTO MFN level, but applicable only between the signatories and not to the rest of the WTO members) are called ''preferential'' by the WTO. According to WTO rules these agreements are subject to certain requirements such as notification to the WTO and general reciprocity (the preferences should apply equally to each of the signatories of the agreement) where unilateral preferences (some of the signatories gain preferential access to the market of the other signatories, without lowering their own tariffs) are allowed only under exceptional circumstances and as temporary measure.&lt;ref&gt;The [[European Union|EU]] got a WTO waiver to grant favourable access to its market for the [[African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States|ACP]] states, without requiring that in return they open their markets to competition from the EU. The WTO waiver already expired and currently the EU and the ACP states are negotiating [[Economic Partnership Agreements|WTO compliant reciprocial agreements]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The trade agreements called ''preferential'' by the WTO are also known as ''regional'' (RTA), despite not necessarily concluded by countries within a certain region. There are currently 205 agreements in force as of July 2007. Over 300 have been reported to the WTO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/region_e/region_e.htm|title=Regional trade agreements|date=July 2007|publisher=[[WTO]]|accessdate=2008-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of FTA has increased significantly over the last decade. Between 1948 and 1994, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the predecessor to the WTO, received 124 notifications. Since 1995 over 300 trade agreements have been enacted.&lt;ref name="WTO Facts and figures"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/region_e/regfac_e.htm|title=Facts and figures|publisher=World Trade Organization|accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WTO is further classifying these agreements in the following types:
* ''[[Good (economics)|Goods]] covering'':
** basic ''preferential trade agreement'' (a.k.a. ''partial scope agreement'')
** ''free trade agreement''
** ''customs union''
* ''[[Service (economics)|Services]] covering'':
** ''Economic Integration Agreement''–any agreement, including a basic PTA, that covers also services

==Reaction==
Trade pacts are frequently politically contentious since they may change economic customs and deepen interdependence with trade partners. Increasing efficiency through "[[free trade]]" is a common goal. For the most part, governments are supportive of further trade agreements.

There have been however some concerns expressed by the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]. According to [[Pascal Lamy]], Director-General of the WTO, the proliferation of RTA “...is breeding concern — concern about incoherence, confusion, exponential increase of costs for business, unpredictability and even unfairness in trade relations.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

| date = 2007-09-10
| url = http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/sppl_e/sppl67_e.htm
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the WTO is that while the typical trade agreements (called ''preferential'' or ''regional'' by the WTO) are useful to a degree, it is much more beneficial to focus on global agreements in the WTO framework such as the negotiations of the current [[Doha round]].

The [[anti-globalization movement]] opposes such agreements almost by definition, but some groups normally allied within that movement, e.g. [[green parties]], seek [[fair trade]] or [[safe trade]] provisions that moderate what they perceive to be the ill effects of [[globalization]].

In terms of judicial organisation, the correctional tribunal is one of the chambers&lt;ref&gt;'''chambre''', an administrative division of the magistrates at that site, or seat of a [[Court|tribunal]] or ''cour''&lt;/ref&gt; of the ''tribunal de grande instance''. At the largest of these tribunals, several chambers may hear penal matters. Such tribunals number the chambers to distinguish them, and they are referred to as the ''nth'' correctional chamber or the ''nth'' chamber of the correctional tribunal.

== Jurisdiction of the correctional tribunal ==
The jurisdiction of a court such as the correctional tribunal is determined either by:
* the matters it judges (''ratione materiæ''), 
* the persons it may judge (''ratione personnæ'')
* the territorial scope of its purview (''ratione loci'').
Jurisdiction is the first question to be determined by the ''tribunal correctionnel'' when a matter commes before it, so that it knows whether to proceed. If it cannot, it must ''relever son incompétence'' file a finding of nul jurisdiction (''exception d'incompétence'').

=== Criteria of jurisdiction ===

==== ''Ratione materiæ'' ====
In France, the correctional tribunal is the penal jurisdiction of first instance, competent to judge misdemeanors (delits).&lt;ref name="COJ L211-1"&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=AAA100DD288C4B86E2CFDAD46C9781C3.tpdjo15v_3?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006572085&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071164&amp;dateTexte=20140510 Article L211-1] of the ''Code de l'organisation judiciaire''
&lt;/ref&gt; In ''premier ressort'',&lt;ref&gt;In criminal matters, a double degree of jurisdiction is the rule. In other words one may have a matter re-tried on appeal, after a first trial un premier procès.&lt;/ref&gt; it judges matters that concern the commission of a criminal offence (''infraction pénale'') considered a ''délit'', similar in severity to a misdemeanor.&lt;ref name="COJ L221-9"&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=31EE99AA8998FDED37233C2BA4587789.tpdjo15v_3?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006572095&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071164&amp;dateTexte=20140511 article L221-9] of the ''Code de l'organisation judiciaire''&lt;/ref&gt; In French law a misdemeanor is an offense punished by a prison sentence (peine d'emprisonnement) or by a fine of at least 3750 euros.&lt;ref name="CPP 381"/&gt; The law sets ten years as the maximum length of a prison sentence for a correctional infraction.&lt;ref&gt;The penalty provided by law is tha set for the offense in question, independently of all other rules that may result in harsher sentences for persons found guilty, such as the laws on recidivism.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=31EE99AA8998FDED37233C2BA4587789.tpdjo15v_3?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006572151&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071164&amp;dateTexte=20140511 article 131-4] of the ''Code pénal''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Ratione personnæ'' ====
The correctional tribunal is not competent to judge:
* offenses committed by minors (depending on their age and situation one of the [[juvenile court]]s would be competent or the correctional tribunals for juveniles);
* a misdemeanor committed by the president of the Republic or a member of the government in the exercise of their functions (which would, respectivement, by tried by either the ''[[Haute Cour]]'' or the ''[[Cour de Justice de la République|Cour de justice de la République]]'', competent in such a case).
Beyond these, the correctional tribunal is competent to judge any other person who has reached the [[age of majority]] and has committed an offense. Its competence extends to co-authors and accomplices, assuming they too have also reached the age of majority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=CB19]]]1045C49AB1D6B84673470A811909.tpdila11v_2?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006576389&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154&amp;dateTexte=20150226

If one were a minor, his situation can only be determined by a juvenile court. Any proceedings that concern him will be severed from the correctional tribunal case and take place  only within the framework of the juvenile courts. So in some cases a matter might be examined by two different tribunals.

==== ''Ratione loci'' ====
Territorial [[Jurisdiction|compétence]] is defined with respect to:
* the location of the offense;
* the location of the defendant's residence;
* the place of arrest;
* the place of detention (even if detained for some other reason);
* the domicile or residence of the victim in cases of family abandonment.
At least one of these five locations must be located within the territorial limits of the tribunal de grande instance for the correctional tribunal to be competent to judge the relevant infraction.

Since its latest reform, (''réforme''), the French judicial map includes 177 correctional tribunals whose assigned territory is that of the ''tribunal de grande instance ''of ''première instance''.

=== Exception of incompetence ===
If the correctional tribunal finds that at least one of the competence criteria is absent, it must declare its incompetence: this means that it must refuse to judge the matter. The exception of incompetence is an absolute of the public order, which means that even if all parties had agreed to "chose" the tribunal correctional despite the rules of competence the tribual has an obligation to declare itself incompetent.

If during a trial the correctional tribunal finds that the facts it is judging as a misdemeanor (délit) in fact amount to a crime, it must déclare itself incompétent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=BDB3095531ADE833BBC93C4A46FE2393.tpdjo15v_3?idArticle=LEGIARTI000024497101&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154&amp;dateTexte=20140511 article 469] du code de procédure pénale&lt;/ref&gt; and the matter referred to a ''juge d'instruction'', whose referral is mandatory in matters of crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=BDB3095531ADE833BBC93C4A46FE2393.tpdjo15v_3?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006575195&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154&amp;dateTexte=20140511 article 79] du code de procédure pénale&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptions do exist to the exception of incompetence rule: a normally incompetent tribunal correctional can be brought to need to judge a matter that arise in another jurisdiction. When a matter is judged outside of the territorial jurisdiction it is called ''dépaysement''.

Finally, law has come to recognize a practice of correctional tribunals, by fixing conditions where an act that can be characterized as a ''crime'', rape for example can be judged by the correctional tribunal as a lesser offense, such as sexual aggression rather than rape: this is called ''correctionnalisation''.

==== ''Dépaysement'' ====
In some cases, notably good administration of justice, the matter must be judged in another territorial jurisdiction than the one prescribed ''ratione loci'' rules.

For reasons of public safety, where there is a risk of serious  disturbance of the peace if the trial were held in the competent jurisdiction, the criminal chamber of the court of cassation can refer the matter to a different correctional tribunal. This request can only be made by the ''procureur général'' of the ''[[Court of Cassation (France)|Cour de cassation]],'' after he is informed of the difficulty.

In the interest of good administration of justice the criminal chamber of the court of cassation can also order the referral of a case to another tribunal than the one that is competent ''ratione loci'', either at the request of the public prosecutor of the ''Cour de cassation'', or of the prosector-general of the Court of Appeal in the jurisdiction where the jurisdiction in question has its seat, either on his own initiative or at the request of the parties. For example, if:

* A magistrate, 
* a lawyer, 
* a public or ministerial official, 
* a member of the ''gendarmerie nationale'', 
* an employee of the national police, customs or penal administration 
* or any other person who holds a position of public authority or who is charged with a mission of public service public, 
* a person who is habitually, by his functions or his mission, in relation with the magistrates or officials of the ''tribunal correctionnel'' which has jurisdiction
the ''[[Prosecutor#France|procureur]]'' of the [[Court of appeal (France)|Court of Appeal]] that has jurisdiction over the particular correctional tribunal may, ''d'office'', at the request of the ''[[Prosecutor#France|procureur]]'' of the ''tribunal correctionnel'' and at the application of interested parties, transfer the proceeding to the ''tribunal de grande instance'' closest to the jurisdiction of the court of appeal, which will then have jurisdiction in the case, ''par dérogation aux dispositions de compétence territoriale''.

Cases exist of material impossibility to hold the trial before the competent correctional tribunal. A referral may be ordered by the criminal chamber if the court that would normally have jurisdiction cannot be legally assembled or if the course of justice finds itself otherwise interrupted. A request for referral may be presented, either by the ''procureur général'' before the Court of cassation, or by the established ''ministère public'' before the jurisdiction in question.

More often, especially in smaller jurisdictions, if the normally competent jurisdiction  cannot be composed because the incompatibilities exist that the law has provided for, the first president of the ''cour d'appel'' can order the matter sent back to a neighboring jurisdiction situated in the scope of that court and designated by a special ordinance passed every year by the first president of the court of appeal indicating for each of its jurisdictions the jurisdiction to which procedures may be sent for this reason.

==== Correctionnalisation ====
A lack of means in the [[Cour d'assises|cours d'assises]] in [[France]] allows some defendants to be judged by the correctional tribunal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ribaut-pasqualini.avocat.fr/index.php?post/2010/01/15/La-correctionnalisation-des-crimes2|title=La correctionnalisation des crimes|website=ribaut-pasqualini.avocat.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; after committing a crime. This is termed ''correctionnalisation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://littre.reverso.net/dictionnaire-francais/definition/correctionnalisation/16619|title=correctionnalisation : définition de correctionnalisation, citations, exemples et usage pour correctionnalisation dans le dictionnaire de français Littré adapté du grand dictionnaire de la langue française d'Emile Littré|website=littre.reverso.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; While illegal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fxrd.blogspirit.com/archive/2007/12/04/la-correctionnalisation-judiciaire.html|title=La correctionnalisation judiciaire|website=fxrd.blogspirit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the arrangement often suits both parties;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maitre-eolas.fr/post/2005/02/14/76-politiquement-correctionnel|title=Politiquement correctionnel|first=|last=Eolas|date=14 February 2005|website=www.maitre-eolas.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; the prosecutor or examining magistrate increases the likelihood of a shorter and  simpler trial, while the defendant sees  his crime downgraded to a simple misdemeanor-like ''délit''.

== Composition of a ''tribunal correctionnel'' ==
A French correctional tribunal is composed of:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=53637A46335CCF9A1D5280FC9F22679C.tpdjo02v_2?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006576467&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154&amp;dateTexte=20080207 article 398] du code de procédure pénale&lt;/ref&gt;
* three professional [[judge]]s: a president of the tribunal et deux assessors (Article 398 of the ''Code de procédure pénale'', (Code of Penal Procedure)).
* The ''[[Ministère public (France)|ministère public]]'' or ''parquet'', represented by the ''[[Prosecutor#France|procureur]]'' or his representative. Similar to a [[prosecutor]] in [[common law]] jurisdictions in that he speaks for the community, although the role differs in other ways from jurisdictions where the [[juge d'instruction]] does not exist
* the clerk of the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|tribunal de grande instance|fr}}''

For the tribunal to sit with one judge only, ''à juge unique'', the possible penalty must be less than five years imprisonment and the matter must concern ''délits'' specified by the ''Code de procédure pénale'' as traffic offenses (driving while intoxicated for example), or violence resulting in more than eight days of inability to work (''incapacité Totale de travail (I.T.T.)'') with only one aggravating circumstance. These cases are provided by Article 398-1 of the ''Code de procédure pénale''. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the same article outline some exceptions having to do with provisional detention and procedure for immediate appearance. In cases of the wrong judge (? -t) article 398-2 provides for a return to the collegial formation because the jurisdictional rules are d'ordre public. Usually, it is the ''président de la formation collégiale'' who rules ''à juge unique''.

Sometimes there may be more than three judges if the arguments are expected to be lengthy. One or more additional judges may then attend, because the rule holds that one can only be judged by judges who have heard the arguments. This may pose a problem if one of the judges becomes ill, for example. Only three judges will deliberate the matter, however, regardless of the number who heard it.

== Procedure before the correctional tribunal ==
The arguments are normally held in public, in open court. If publicity would endanger the order and serenity of the arguments, the [[dignity]] of the person or the interests of a third party, the plaintiff or the ''procureur'' may at their option request a closed session. This decision will be publicly rendered. (verify:decision to close? )

The president of the tribunal may prohibit the presence of minors, or of certain minors. He can expel any person who disturbs the arguments, including the defendant.

The procedure before a correctional tribunal unfolds in the following order: 
* The president notes the identity of the defendant and oulines the action the tribunal will judge
* If motions of nul jurisdiction have been filed {{Interlanguage link multi|''in limine litis''|la}}, before the facts of the case are put in evidence, the tribunal theoretically should delve into the incident in depth and deliberate simultaneously on the procedural questions and on the acts with which the defendant is reproached, except if the points raised before a defense is made might play on the outcome of the proceedings. A judgement will be rendered.
* Interrogation of the defendant
* Argument of the plaintiff
* The ''ministère public'' asks for a sentence
* Argument of the defendant's lawyer (if the defendant has chosen to hire a lawyer)
* The last word goes to the defendant.
After the arguments the prosecutor presents the government's demand for a sentence (''réquisitoire oral''). He summarizes the elements of culpability and may advocate a penalty for the defendant. His proposal does not obligate the tribunal; it is an opinion in consultation, given the same weight as the argument of the defense attorney.

== Miscellaneous ==

=== Vocabulary ===
* Individual who appears before the ''tribunal correctionnel''  as a defendant is called ''un prévenu''.
* Victims of a crime are ''[[Plaintiff|parties civiles]]'' when they seek indemnification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22523">Controversy surrounds the '''UK–US extradition treaty of 2003''', which was implemented by the UK in the [[Extradition Act 2003]] and came into force in April 2007 following its ratification by the US Senate in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=The Human Rights Implications of UK Extradition Policy |author=Human Rights Joint Committee |title=The UK's bilateral extradition treaties: US-UK Extradition Treaty 2003 |date=22 June 2011 |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201012/jtselect/jtrights/156/15608.htm |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Torres_2006" /&gt;

==Controversy==
The treaty has been claimed to be one-sided&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article680281.ece |work=The Times |location=London |title=Onesided treaty was meant to handle terrorist suspects |first=Michael |last=Binyon |date=28 June 2006 |accessdate=2 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611202458/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article680281.ece |archivedate=June 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because it allows the US to extradite UK citizens and others for offences committed against US law, even though the alleged offence may have been committed in the UK by a person living and working in the UK (see for example the [[NatWest Three]]), and there being no reciprocal right; and issues about the level of proof required being less to extradite from the UK to the US rather than vice versa.&lt;ref name="C41"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/world/factcheck+are+ukus+extradition+rules+lopsided/166700|title=FactCheck: Are UK-US extradition rules lopsided? - Channel 4 News|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=April 29, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127115814/http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/world/factcheck+are+ukus+extradition+rules+lopsided/166700|archivedate=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other provisions Part 2 of the Act: Extradition to category 2 territories (non-European Arrest warrant territories) removed the requirement on the USA to provide ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence in extraditions from the UK, requiring instead only ''[[reasonable suspicion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8177561.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hacker loses extradition appeal | date=31 July 2009 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was necessary to redress the previous imbalance against the USA under the 1870 Act, as the UK did not have to provide the more onerous ''prima facie'' evidence to extradite from the USA. The requirement for the UK is to show ''[[probable cause]]''. However, an independent legal review carried out by Sir Scott Baker found that "there is no significant difference between the probable cause test and the reasonable suspicion test. There is no practical difference between the information submitted to and from the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15351357|publisher=BBC News|title=US extradition law not biased against Britons - judge|date=18 October 2011|quote=But Sir Scott's 486-page report finds: "In our opinion, there is no significant difference between the probable cause test and the reasonable suspicion test. "There is no practical difference between the information submitted to and from the United States."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also concern{{Weasel inline|date=June 2011}} at the loss of entitlement of UK citizens to [[legal aid]] for maintaining an adequate defence to criminal charges once they are extradited to US jurisdiction where costs are largely met by the defendant's private means. This has been a cause of controversy in cases where it has been perceived that the UK has suitable legislation for prosecuting offences domestically.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The manner of its implementation also caused concern because of alleged secrecy and minimal parliamentary scrutiny.&lt;ref name="C41" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2006-07-12b.1396.1|title=I beg to move, That this House do...: 12 Jul 2006: House of Commons debates|last=|first=|date=|website=TheyWorkForYou|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statewatch.org/news/2003/jul/analy18.pdf|title=Statewatch analysis no 17: The new UK-US Extradition Treaty|last=Hayes|first=Ben|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these concerns, the Home Secretary [[Theresa May]] appointed [[Scott Baker (judge)|The Rt Hon. Lord Justice Scott Baker]] to conduct an official review of the UK's extradition treaties, with the assistance of two independent extradition experts. The review was directed to address evidence standards and whether the US-UK Extradition Treaty is unbalanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Rt Hon Sir Scott Baker will lead an independent panel to conduct a review into the UK's extradition arrangements|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/press-releases/sir-scott-baker-review|publisher=Home Office|accessdate=8 August 2012|date=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Scott Baker's report was presented to the Home Secretary on September 30, 2011, and concluded that there is no substantial difference in evidence standards, that the treaty is balanced and that there is not "any basis to conclude that extradition from the United Kingdom to the US 
operates unfairly or oppressively"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15351357|publisher=BBC News|title=US extradition law not biased against Britons - judge|date=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/police/operational-policing/extradition-review?view=Binary|title=A review of the United Kingdom's extradition arrangements|publisher=The Home Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review contradicts the findings of Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR), which was intended to form part of the Government's full extradition review and which called for the Government to renegotiate the UK's extradition treaty with the United States to ensure British citizens get the same protection as Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15351357|publisher=BBC News|title=US extradition law not biased against Britons - judge|date=18 October 2011|quote=The review contradicts the findings of Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR), which called for the Government to renegotiate the UK's extradition treaty with the United States to ensure British citizens get the same protection as Americans. In a report in June, the committee said US authorities should have to show enough evidence to establish probable cause before a Briton can be extradited.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Home Affairs Select Committee recently published a report&lt;ref name="Home Affairs Committee"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Home Affairs Committee Committee|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmhaff/644/644.pdf|work=The US-UK Extradition Treaty|publisher=House of Commons, London|accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; into the UK/US extradition treaty and Extradition Act, acknowledging the low level of public confidence in the UK's extradition legislation. The Committee were particularly critical of the failure of the Home Office to publish the evidence that lies behind the Home Office-commissioned Scott Baker review – the only parliamentary review to conclude that the US/UK Treaty was not imbalanced.
The Committee has "serious misgivings"&lt;ref name="Home Affairs Committee" /&gt; about some aspects of the US/UK arrangements but was at pains to recognise the importance of an effective extradition arrangement between the two countries.
With respect to the differing legal standards of evidence required in support of an extradition request, the Committee accepted that there was "little or no distinction in practice between the 'probable cause' and 'reasonable suspicion' tests".&lt;ref name="Home Affairs Committee" /&gt;
The Committee further acknowledges that "extradition imposes a significant burden on the accused"&lt;ref name="Home Affairs Committee" /&gt;
On the most controversial of issues – that of forum – that campaigners have long been seeking to have introduced in UK legislation, the committee delivers perhaps its strongest message to parliament: "The Committee believes that it would be in the interests of justice for decisions about forum in cases where there is concurrent jurisdiction to be taken by a judge in open court, where the defendant will have the opportunity to put his case, rather than in private by prosecutors". The Committee concludes by recognising that it proposes significant amendments to the current legislation given the loss of public confidence in the current system. The Committee urges the government "to act with greater urgency"&lt;ref name="Home Affairs Committee" /&gt; to rectify the issues the report has identified.

Many say{{Who|date=October 2012}} that the issue of forum is the key reform that will help bring an end to ongoing and future injustices that they say have occurred under the Extradition Act 2003.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In April 2012 it was revealed in a Freedom of Information request to the UK Home Office that no US citizens have been extradited from the US to the UK under this treaty for crimes committed while the person was in the US.&lt;ref name="tg"&gt;{{cite news|title=No American citizens extradited to UK over crimes allegedly committed in US|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9237663/No-American-citizens-extradited-to-UK-over-crimes-allegedly-committed-in-US.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=2012-05-01|quote=Not one US citizen has been extradited to Britain as a result of crimes said to have been committed in America since a controversial transatlantic treaty came into force, it has been disclosed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==US ratification, 2006==

The US-UK Extradition Treaty 2003 was first sent to the [[US Senate]] for approval in April 2004. But another component of the controversy noted above was a result of the delay of the US in ratifying it into US law. [[Baroness Scotland]], UK Minister of State for the Criminal Justice System at the [[Home Office]], travelled to the US on Thursday 13 July 2006 to address this problem. This move was prompted by political criticism of the Extradition Act 2003 within the UK and an [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] proposal to amend the Act in the [[House of Lords]]. It also coincided with public disquiet at the case of the [[NatWest Three]] who were extradited on the same date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5163982.stm|title=UK to act over NatWest 3 treaty |date=10 July 2006|publisher=[[BBC News website]]|accessdate=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant the NatWest three were extradited to the US under the US-UK Extradition Treaty 2003, even though that treaty had not been ratified in the US.

On 30 September 2006 the US Senate unanimously ratified the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aEgU_TIgfK1U&amp;refer=home|title=Senate Unanimously Ratifies US, UK Extradition Treaty|last=Torres|first=Carlos|date=30 September 2006|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|accessdate=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[British Home Secretary]] [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]] said he was "''delighted''" that Baroness Scotland's visit to the US over the summer succeeded in getting Senate agreement.

{{Politics of Ukraine}}

The '''Ukrainian presidential election, 2004''' was held on October 31, November 21 and December 26, 2004. The election was the fourth [[President of Ukraine|presidential]] election to take place in [[Ukraine]] following independence from the [[Soviet Union]]. The last stages of the election were contested between the [[Our Ukraine (political party)|opposition leader]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]] and the incumbent [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] from the [[Party of Regions]]. The election was held in a highly charged political atmosphere, with allegations of media bias, [[voter intimidation]] and a poisoning of candidate Yushchenko with [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/51514/ Dead End], [[Kyiv Post]] (October 29, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ukraine's electoral law, a [[two-round system]] is used to elect the President in which a candidate must win a majority (50% or more) of all ballots cast. The first round of voting was held on October 31, 2004. As no candidate had 50% or more of the votes cast a run-off ballot between the two-highest polling candidates, Viktor Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych, was held on November 21. According to official [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine|Central Election Commission]] results announced on November 23, the run-off election was won by Viktor Yanukovych. The election results were challenged by Viktor Yushchenko and his supporters with many international observers claiming that the election was rigged.&lt;ref name=CEforIP&gt;[[Anders Åslund]] and [[Michael McFaul]] (January 2006).

The subsequent events led to a political crisis in Ukraine, with widespread peaceful protesters, dubbed the "[[Orange Revolution]]," calling for a re-run second round election. The [[Supreme Court of Ukraine|Ukrainian Supreme Court]] annulled the official run-off results and ordered a repeat of second round ballot.&lt;ref name=CEforIP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

The final re-run ballot was held on December 26. Viktor Yushchenko was declared the winner with 52 percent of the vote to Yanukovych's 44 percent.

International observers reported that the re-run ballot was considered overall fairer than the previous ballots.&lt;ref name=CEforIP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

==Candidates==
All together 26 candidates had been nominated and participated in presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www2.pravda.com.ua/news/2009/6/22/96993.htm Тіні технічних кандидатів], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (June 22, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main contenders in the election were the incumbent Prime Minister and government-supported candidate [[Viktor Yanukovych]] and opposition leader [[Viktor Yushchenko]]. Viktor Yanukovych, who was the Prime Minister since 2002, was supported by the outgoing President [[Leonid Kuchma]], as well as by the [[Russia]]n government and then president [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref name=CEforIP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

Viktor Yushchenko was portrayed as being more [[pro-Western]] and had received support of the [[European Union]] states and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=CEforIP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/26/ukraine.usa US campaign behind the turmoil in Kiev] by [[Ian Traynor]], [[The Guardian]] (November 26, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The preliminary ballot of the 2004 presidential election was held on October 31, 2004. The official results recorded Viktor Yushchenko with 39.87 percent and Victor Yanukovych 39.32 percent of the votes cast. As no candidate had secured 50% or more votes required for outright victory, a [[run-off election]] was scheduled for November 21. Although a 75 percent turnout was recorded in the initial vote, observers reported many irregularities, particularly in the regions where Yushchenko's support was seen to be strongest.&lt;ref name=CEforIP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; It was unclear how much of an impact this had on the result.

A total of 28,035,184 voters participated in the first round of voting. Results of the preliminary vote were as follows:

Following the November 21 run-off ballot, Ukraine's electoral commission declared Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych with 49.42% of the vote the winner with Viktor Yushchenko receiving 46.69% of the ballots cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cvk.gov.ua/postanovy/2004/p1265_2004_d.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930223042/http://www.cvk.gov.ua/postanovy/2004/p1265_2004_d.htm |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Observers for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) said the run-off vote "did not meet international standards" and U.S. senior election observer, Senator [[Richard Lugar]], called it a "concerted and forceful program of election day fraud".

The geographic distribution of the votes showed a clear east-west division of Ukraine, which is rooted deeply in the [[History of Ukraine|country's history]]. The western and central parts roughly correspond with the former territories of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the 17th century. They are considered more pro-Western, with the population mostly [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]-speaking and [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic]] (Uniate) in the west or [[Ukrainian Orthodox]] in the center, and have voted predominantly for Yushchenko. The heavy-industrialized eastern part, including the [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]], where the links with [[Russia]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] are much stronger, and which contains many ethnic Russians, is a Yanukovych stronghold.

Between the two rounds of the election, dramatic increases in turnout were recorded in Yanukovych-supporting regions, while Yushchenko-supporting regions recorded the same turnout or lower than recorded in the first round. This effect was most marked in eastern Ukraine and especially in Yanukovych's stronghold of [[Donetsk Oblast]], where a turnout of 98.5% was reportedly claimed—more than 40% up from the first round.&lt;ref name=CEforIP /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt; In some districts, turnout was recorded to be more than 100% than the previous ballot, with one district reported by observers to have recorded a 127% turnout.&lt;ref name=CEforIP /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt; According to election observers and post-election investigations, pro-Yanukovych activists traveled around the country and voted many times as absentees.&lt;ref name=CEforIP /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt; Some groups dependent on government assistance, such as students, hospital patients and prisoners, were told to vote for the government candidate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Invisible-ink-how-they-rigged-the-vote/2004/12/02/1101923247133.html Invisible ink: how they rigged the vote], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' (December 2, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other alleged irregularities were reported, including [[ballot stuffing]], intimidation at voting booths and huge numbers of new voters appearing on the electoral rolls—in [[Donetsk]] alone, half a million more voters were registered for the runoff election. Yanukovych won all but one of the regions where significant increases in turnout were noted. It was later determined by the [[Supreme Court of Ukraine|Ukrainian Supreme Court]] that this was in fact due to widespread falsification of the results.&lt;ref name=CEforIP /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt;

==International influence and reaction==

Many commentators saw the elections as being influenced by outside powers, notably the [[United States]], the [[European Union]] and [[Russia]], with the US and EU backing Yushchenko ([[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]], former [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] and [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John McCain]] all visited Kiev, in official or private capacities {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}), and Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] publicly backing Yanukovych. In the media the two candidates were contrasted, with Yushchenko representing both the pro-Western [[Kiev]] residents as well as the rural Ukrainians, whereas Yanukovych representing the Eastern, pro-Russian industrial laborers.&lt;ref name=CEforIP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

More specifically it was considered that a Yushchenko victory would represent a halt of Ukraine's integration with the rest of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], and possibly a cancellation of the [[Eurasian Economic Community#Common Economic Space|Common Economic Space]] between Russia, Ukraine, [[Belarus]] and [[Kazakhstan]] that had already been agreed to by the Ukrainian parliament; he would instead be likely to increase attempts at further integration with Europe and a possible membership in the EU and NATO. Viktor Yanukovych had promised to make Russian an official language for Ukraine, as is also the case in other CIS member states Belarus, Kazakhstan and [[Kyrgyzstan]].

===European Union===

[[Image:Ukrainian Round Table 2004.jpg|thumb|2Round table talks with Ukrainian and foreign representatives during the [[Orange Revolution]] on December 1 in [[Kiev]].]]

The [[European Union]] made it clear that they would not recognize the results of the election. All 25 member countries of the EU summoned their ambassadors from Ukraine in order to register a sharp protest against what is seen as election fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do;jsessionid=335ED3B0E938A20E30BDED4B98B2B687.node1?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2004-0046+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN European Parliament resolution on the forthcoming presidential elections in Ukraine], [[The European Parliament]] (October 28, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] disputed the election process in Ukraine, with [[European Commission]] [[President of the European Commission|President]] [[José Manuel Barroso]] warning of consequences if there is no review of the election. During a meeting between Putin and EU officials in [[the Hague]], the Russian president opposed the EU reaction by saying that he was "deeply convinced that we have no moral right to push a big European state to any kind of massive disorder."

Among EU member states, Ukraine's western neighbors were most concerned. In [[Poland]], Ukraine's largest western neighbor, politicians, the media and ordinary citizens enthusiastically supported Yushchenko and opposed the election fraud. Polish deputies to the [[European Parliament]] have called for giving Ukraine the prospect of future EU membership provided the country obeyed democratic standards. Western EU members are however more reluctant with the idea of Ukrainian membership in the EU, which results in Polish media accusing them of being more interested in the integration process with [[Turkey]] and maintaining good relations with Russia.

On November 25, former Ukrainian foreign minister and a close collaborator of Yushchenko, [[Borys Tarasyuk]] delivered a speech before the Polish [[Sejm]], urging Poland not to recognize the election result and help solve the political crisis. On the same day former Polish President [[Lech Wałęsa]] went to Kiev to publicly express his support for Viktor Yushchenko. He was later followed by a number of Polish MPs from different parties.

On November 26 the [[President of Poland]] [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]] arrived in Kiev, followed on the same day by the [[Union Minister for Foreign Affairs|EU Minister for Foreign Affairs]] [[Javier Solana]] and the Lithuanian president [[Valdas Adamkus]].

===United States===

The [[United States government]] also decided not to recognize the election, and expressed dissatisfaction with the results; the outgoing [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]], [[Colin Powell]], quite unequivocally stated that the result announced could not be accepted as legitimate by the [[United States]]. [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] and various members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] made statements disclosing their concern over the legitimacy of the polling. Prominent former [[Cold War]] hawk [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] cast the election as an opposition to renewed [[Imperial Russia|Russian imperialism]]:

{{quote|Russia is more likely to make a break with its imperial past if the newly independent post-Soviet states are vital and stable. Their vitality will temper any residual Russian imperial temptations. Political and economic support for the new states must be an integral part of a broader strategy for integrating Russia into a cooperative transcontinental system. A [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] Ukraine is a critically important component of such a policy, as is support for such strategically pivotal states as [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comw.org/pda/fulltext/9709brzezinski.html A geostrategy for Eurasia by Zbigniew Brzezinski&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

U.S. Senators [[John McCain]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] jointly wrote a letter nominating Victor Yushchenko along with Georgian President [[Mikhail Saakashvili]] for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. The nomination was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2005-02/McCain-intvu-4Feb2005.cfm?renderforprint=1&amp;textonly=1&amp;&amp;TEXTMODE=1&amp;CFID=325983691&amp;CFTOKEN=32206922&amp;jsessionid=de308c70569d672ad4905073587111252664 Senator McCain Tells Ukrainians of Nobel Nomination for Yushchenko]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Voice of America]] (February 5, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2005/ The Nobel Peace Prize 2005], [[Nobel Foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia and the CIS===

Russia's President, Vladimir Putin congratulated Viktor Yanukovych, which was followed shortly afterward by [[Belarus|Belorussian]] president [[Alexander Lukashenko]], on his victory before election results were officially declared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kvali.com/kvali/index.asp?obiektivi=show&amp;n=195 Kvali Online Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101030813/http://www.kvali.com/kvali/index.asp?obiektivi=show&amp;n=195 |date=2007-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CIS election observation missions|CIS election observers]] praised the second round of the elections as "legitimate and of a nature that reflected democratic standards", a view in direct contradiction to other monitoring organizations such as the [[European Network of Election Monitoring Organizations|ENEMO]], the [[Committee of Voters of Ukraine]] and the [[International Election Observation Mission|IEOM]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=401&amp;issue_id=3151&amp;article_id=2368899 The Jamestown Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315192059/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=401&amp;issue_id=3151&amp;article_id=2368899 |date=2005-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent hardliners in Russia cast the election as opposition to renewed Western [[imperialism]]. [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Russian Communist Party]] leader [[Gennady Zyuganov]], for example, blames the West for interfering in the situation in Ukraine in the run-up to the October 31 presidential election:

{{quote|I have been in Kiev for a third day and I see for myself that the numerous actions of local opposition bear the earmarks of those groups that at different times tried to destabilize Prague, Budapest and Bucharest — the earmarks of U.S. special services.}}

On November 28, [[Yuriy Luzhkov]], the Mayor of Moscow, gave a speech denouncing the Ukrainian opposition, calling its members a "sabbath of witches" pretending to "represent the whole of the nation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/28/international/europe/28cnd-ukraine.html?ex=1102309200&amp;en=ff2c4369fabe9ed3&amp;ei=5040&amp;partner=MOREOVER The New York Times International &gt; Europe &gt; Supporters of President-Elect in Ukraine Push Back&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Russian newspapers have printed increasingly shrill warnings,&lt;ref name=CEforIP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; with the Communist party paper ''[[Pravda]]'' claiming: "NATO troops in Hungary and Poland are preparing to move, and Romanian and Slovakian military units have been put on alert. Ukrainian towns are in their sights."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4061315.stm Press elation and alarm at Ukraine events], [[BBC News]] (December 2, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other CIS countries lined up with Russia in supporting Yanukovych. [[Belarus]]ian President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] phoned Yanukovych to offer his own congratulations before the results had been officially declared. [[Kazakhstan]]'s President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] wrote to Yanukovych that "Your victory shows that the Ukrainian people have made a choice in favour of the unity of the nation, of democratic development and economic progress."&lt;ref name=ExSovietStates/&gt; The presidents of [[Kyrgyzstan]] ([[Askar Akayev]]) and of [[Uzbekistan]] ([[Islam Karimov]]) likewise sent their congratulations. However, later Karimov criticized Russia's involvement in the Ukrainian election, saying that "Russia's excessive demonstration of its willingness to see a certain outcome in the vote has done more harm than good."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20060525090349/http://www.mosnews.com/news/2004/12/02/karimov.shtml Mosnews.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] president [[Mikhail Saakashvili]] indicated his support for the supporters of Yushchenko, saying that "What is happening in Ukraine today clearly attests to the importance of Georgia's example for the rest of the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4047661.stm BBC NEWS | Europe | Ex-Soviet bloc states mull election&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This was a reference to the [[Rose Revolution]] of late 2003. Indeed, Georgians have been highly visible in the demonstrations in Kiev and the [[flag of Georgia (country)|flag of Georgia]] has been among those on display in the city's Independence Square, while Yushchenko himself held up a rose in a seeming reference to the Rose Revolution. [[Moldova's Foreign Ministry]] issued a statement late November 2004 that stated "basic democratic principles were distorted" and expressed regret that the poll "lacked the objective criteria necessary for their recognition by both the citizens of Ukraine and the international community".&lt;ref name=ExSovietStates/&gt;

[[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] kept more cautious positions, supporting neither side but stressing the need for Ukrainian unity.&lt;ref name=ExSovietStates&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4047661.stm Ex-Soviet bloc states mull election ], [[BBC News]] (November 27, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, one day before the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a repeat runoff ballot, President Kuchma visited Moscow to discuss the crisis with Russia's President Vladimir Putin. Putin supported Kuchma's position of desiring wholly new elections, rather than just a repeat of the second round.&lt;ref name=CEforIP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

==Re-run==
The final results of the rerun ballot recorded Viktor Yushchenko receiving 52.00% of the votes, with Viktor Yanukovych on 44.19% which represented a change in the vote by +5.39% to Yushchenko and -5.27% from Yanukovych.

Viktor Yanukovych conceded defeat on December 31, 2004 and subsequently resigned as Ukraine's Prime Minister the same day. Despite Yushchenko's victory in the second round of voting, the regional voting patterns remained largely unchanged between each round, with many southern and eastern provinces supporting Yanukovych, with the west and central regions favoring Yushchenko.

Ukraine's supreme court rejected an appeal lodged by Viktor Yanukovych against the electoral commission's conduct of the election on January 6.

On January 10 the Ukrainian Electoral Commission officially declared Viktor Yushchenko the winner and on January 11 published the final election results,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvk.gov.ua/postanovy/2005/p0015_2005.htm Постанова ЦВК від 10 січня 2005 року №15&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050312021855/http://www.cvk.gov.ua/postanovy/2005/p0015_2005.htm |date=2005-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; clearing the way for Yushchenko to be inaugurated as Ukraine's fifth President. The official ceremonies took place on Sunday, January 23 at about noon, when Yushchenko undertook the constitutional oath was sworn in as President.

In November 2009 Yanukovych stated that although his victory in the elections was "taken away" he gave up this victory in order to avoid bloodshed. "I didn't want mothers to lose their children and wives their husbands. I didn't want dead bodies from [[Kiev]] to flow down the [[Dnieper River|Dnipro]]. I didn't want to assume power through bloodshed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/26340/ Yanukovych says presidential election scenario of 2004 won't be repeated in 2010], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (November 27, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Despite alleged convincing evidence pointing to high-level involvement in the [[Leonid Kuchma|Kuchma]] administration and the [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zWAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT20 The Orange Revolution] by [[Taras Kuzio]], [[Democracy at Large]], {{ISSN|1552-9606}}, volume 1/number 2, 2005 (page 9)&lt;/ref&gt; no criminal election fraud charges have been filed against any top officials. The prosecutor general did arrest several public figures on charges of election fraud in the first half of 2005, but no high-profile case was brought to court.&lt;ref name=CoEar/&gt; On 23 September 2005 Yushchenko announced a pact with the [[Party of Regions]] in which he promised to look into an amnesty for those convicted of vote rigging during the 2004 Ukrainian presidential elections.&lt;ref name=CoEar&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ebjEVjJ-DcAC&amp;pg=PA580 Countries at the crossroads: a survey of democratic governance] by Sanja Tatic &amp; Christopher Walker, [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers]], 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-7425-5801-4}} (page 580)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1342327.html Corruption Watch: October 3, 2005], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (October 3, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; One of the top election-fraud suspects, former CEC head Serhiy Kivalov, is a [[Party of Regions]] deputy who heads the [[Ukrainian Parliament]]'s Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/54839/ Nation’s law enforcers have dismal track record], [[Kyiv Post]] (December 11, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act''' ('''VGBA''') is a [[United States]] law named after Graeme Baker, who died in an accident in June 2002, when the suction from a spa drain entrapped her under the water.  She was the daughter of James and Nancy Baker and the granddaughter of former Secretary of State [[James Baker III]]. The Act was first introduced by Representative [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]] and was supported by the Baker family and Safe Kids Worldwide.
{{wikisource}}

==Entrapment==

[[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] staff began investigating reported incidents of [[swimming pool]]/[[spa]] suction entrapment incidents in the 1970s. Such incidents included entrapment of hair, body, limb, evisceration or disembowelment and mechanical entrapment of jewelry or bathing suits. From 1999 to 2007 for all age categories records were examined. In 2007, for all age categories, there were 74 reports of circulation entrapments. Individuals in the 5- to 9-year-old category had the highest frequency of entrapment reports.&lt;ref&gt;Reported Pool/Spa-Related Related Circulation/Suction Entrapments, CPCS, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
The goals of the VGBA were to enhance the safety of public and private pools and spas, to reduce child drownings, to reduce the number of suction entrapment incidents, injuries and deaths; and to educate the public on the importance of constant supervision of children in and around water.

==Legal status==

===Federal requirements===
There is a federal requirement for public pools that preempts the state or local law, as of December 19, 2008, and further regulations are in addition to it:

''Sec. 1404: Top Priority for Public Pool And Spa Owners/Operators''
All pool/spa drain covers manufactured, distributed or entered into commerce on or after December 19, 2008 must meet ASME/ANSI A112.19.8– 2007. All public pools and spas must be retrofitted with covers that meet the ASME/ANSI A112.19.8– 2007 standard. All public pools and spas that have a single drain other than an unblockable drain must employ one or more additional options.

===State requirements===
A pool contractor should verify that the pool and/or spa is in compliance with the federally mandated Virginia Graeme Baker Pool &amp; Spa Safety Act which takes effect December 19, 2008.  If the pool is not in compliance, the necessary steps should be taken to comply with the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool &amp; Spa Safety Act, that, in essence, specifies that:
:All public pools and spas, both new and existing, shall be equipped with drain covers compliant with ASME/ANSI A112.19.8 2007 standard.

In addition, all public pools and spas with a single main drain other than an un-blockable drain, shall also employ one or more of the following devices: separated drain system per ANSI/APSP 7, safety vacuum release system (SVRS) that complies with ANSI/ASME A112.19.17 or ASTM F2387; suction-limiting vent system; gravity drainage system; automatic pump shutoff; drain disablement; equivalent system determined by the CPSC.

The definition of un-blockable drain in the Act is a "drain sump of any size or shape that a human body cannot sufficiently block to create a suction entrapment issue."

Link to the Act: Title XIV—Pool and Spa Safety Act

===Compliant drain covers===
The VGBA requires all drain covers to either be manufactured products or to be field fabricated outlets", in each case meeting the specific technical requirements of the act and having the necessary certification.

The PSSA requires a safe and secure connection between the cover and sump. A new, compliant cover that fits securely into a pre-existing sump is accepted under certain conditions.

==SVRS devices==
These are used in conjunction with an approved main drain cover and skimmer. They come in three main varieties:{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

*Mechanical devices which let air into pump to ease the vacuum when entrapment or blockage is sensed by device.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
*Electro-mechanical devices that shut off pump when blockage/entrapment is sensed.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
*Pumps or motors with built-in software that shuts off pump when blockage/entrapment is sensed.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

'''The Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies''' is a [[multilateral export control regime]] (MECR) with 42 participating states including many former [[Comecon]] ([[Warsaw Pact]]) countries.

The Wassenaar Arrangement was established to contribute to regional and international security and stability by promoting transparency and greater responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and [[dual-use technology|dual-use goods and technologies]], thus preventing destabilizing accumulations. Participating states seek, through their national policies, to ensure that transfers of these items do not contribute to the development or enhancement of military capabilities which undermine these goals, and are not diverted to support such capabilities.

It is the successor to the [[Cold war|Cold War]]-era [[Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls]], and was established on 12 July 1996, in [[Wassenaar]], the [[Netherlands]], which is near [[The Hague]]. The Wassenaar Arrangement is considerably less strict than COCOM, focusing primarily on the transparency of national export control regimes and not granting veto power to individual members over organizational decisions. A Secretariat for administering the agreement is located in [[Vienna]], Austria. Like COCOM, however, it is not a treaty, and therefore is not legally binding.

Every six months member countries exchange information on deliveries of conventional arms to non-Wassenaar members that fall under eight broad weapons categories: battle tanks, [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s (AFVs), large-caliber artillery, military aircraft, military helicopters, warships, missiles or missile systems, and [[small arms]] and light weapons.

== Control lists ==
The outline of the arrangement is set out in a document entitled "Guidelines &amp; Procedures, including the Initial Elements".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wassenaar.org/app/uploads/2015/06/WA-DOC-17-PUB-001-Public-Docs-Vol-I-Founding-Documents.pdf#page=7 Guidelines &amp; Procedures, including the Initial Elements] The Wassenaar Arrangement&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.wassenaar.org/control-lists/ list of restricted technologies] is broken into two parts, the "List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies" (also known as the ''Basic List'') and the "Munitions List". The Basic List is composed of ten categories based on increasing levels of sophistication:

* Category 1 – Special Materials and Related Equipment
* Category 2 – [[Materials Processing]]
* Category 3 – [[Electronics]]
* Category 4 – [[Computers]]
* Category 5 – Part 1 – [[Telecommunications]]
* Category 5 – Part 2 – [[Information Security]]
* Category 6 – [[Sensor]]s and [[Laser]]s
* Category 7 – [[Navigation]] and [[Avionics]]
* Category 8 – [[Marine (ocean)|Marine]]
* Category 9 – [[Aerospace]] and [[Air propulsion|Propulsion]]

Basic List has two nested subsections—Sensitive and Very Sensitive. Items of the Very Sensitive List include materials for [[stealth technology]]—&lt;nowiki/&gt;i.e., equipment that could be used for submarine detection, advanced [[radar]], and [[jet engine]] technologies.

The Munitions List has 22 categories, which are not labeled.

In order for an item to be placed on the lists, Member States must take into account the following 
[https://www.wassenaar.org/app/uploads/2016/01/08Criteria-for-the-Selection-of-Dual-Use-Goods-including-Sensitive-and-Very-Sensitive-Items.pdf criteria]:
* Foreign availability outside Participating States
* Ability to effectively control the export of the goods
* Ability to make a clear and objective specification of the item.
* Controlled by another regime, such as the [[Australia Group]], [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]], or [[Missile Technology Control Regime]]

=== Admission requirements ===
Admission requires states to:
* Be a producer or exporter of arms or sensitive industrial equipment
* Maintain non-proliferation policies and appropriate national policies, including adherence to:
** Non-proliferation policies, such as (where applicable) the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]], the [[Missile Technology Control Regime]], and the [[Australia Group]]
** [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]], the [[Biological Weapons Convention]], the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] and, where applicable, [[START I]] (including the [[Lisbon Protocol]]) 
* Maintain fully effective [[export control]]s

The People's Republic of China and Israel are not members. The Arrangement is open on a global and non-discriminatory basis to prospective adherents that comply with the agreed criteria. Admission of new members requires the [[Unanimity|consensus of all members]]. 

[[India]] joined as the 42nd participating state on 07 December 2017. "Wassenaar Arrangement participating states reviewed the progress of a number of current membership applications and agreed at the plenary meeting to admit India which will become the Arrangement's 42nd participating state as soon as the necessary procedural arrangements for joining the WA are completed," the grouping said in a statement. &lt;ref name="WA_Plenary_2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wassenaar.org/app/uploads/2017/12/WA-Plenary-2017-Chairs-Statement.pdf|title=Statement Issued by the Plenary Chair on 2017 Outcomes of the Wassenaar Arrangement|date=7 December 2017|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/wassenaar-arrangement-decides-to-make-india-its-member/article21293077.ece|title=Wassenaar Arrangement decides to make India its member|date=8 December 2017|publisher=|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's application was supported by Russia, USA, France and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/india-becomes-member-of-key-export-control-regime-117120800044_1.html|title=India becomes member of key export control regime|first=|last=IANS|date=8 December 2017|publisher=|via=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2013 amendments ==
In December 2013, the list of export restricted technologies was amended to include internet-based surveillance systems. New technologies placed under the export control regime include "intrusion software"—software designed to defeat a computer or network's protective measures so as to extract data or information—as well as [[Internet protocol suite|IP]] [[Computer and network surveillance|network surveillance]] systems. 

The purpose of the amendments was to prevent Western technology companies from selling surveillance technology to governments known to abuse human rights. However, some technology companies have expressed concerns that the scope of the controls may be too broad, limiting security researchers' ability to identify and correct security vulnerabilities. [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] criticized the agreement for the restrictions it will place on activities like [[penetration test]]ing, sharing information about threats, and [[bug bounty program]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Google says controversial export proposal would make the world 'less secure'|url = https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/20/9005351/google-wassenaar-arrangement-proposal-comments|website = The Verge|accessdate = 2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wassenaar rules are not the right direction - Facebook U.S. Public Policy {{!}} Facebook|url = https://www.facebook.com/uspublicpolicy/posts/1047027321981746|website = www.facebook.com|accessdate = 2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the restrictions will weaken the [[computer security|security]] of participating nations and do little to curb threats from non-participant nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cyber industry assails anti-hacking regulations|url = http://thehill.com/regulation/cybersecurity/248579-cyber-industry-assails-anti-hacking-regulations|accessdate = 2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The international rules that have the security world on alert|url = https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/22/8644185/wassenaar-arrangement-export-zero-day-research|website = The Verge|accessdate = 2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
