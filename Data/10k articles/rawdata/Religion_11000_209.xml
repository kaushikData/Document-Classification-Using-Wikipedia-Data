The '''Adventist Church of Promise''' ({{lang-pt|Igreja Adventista da Promessa}} or "IAP"&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.portaliap.com.br/imprensa.php Logomarca] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508153553/http://www.portaliap.com.br/imprensa.php |date=May 8, 2009 }}" (Logo) page on the church's official website. The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] title is ''Iglesia Adventista de la Promesa''. Accessed 2009-09-10&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Christianity|Christian]] denomination which is both [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbatarian]] [[Adventism|Adventist]] and classical [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] in its doctrine and worship. It was founded in [[Brazil]] in 1932 by pastor John August Silveira (Portuguese [[João Augusto da Silveira]]), as a split-off from the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].

It is the second-largest Adventist denomination in South America (after the Seventh-day Adventist Church). It claims to be the first indigenous Brazilian Pentecostal denomination. (The earlier [[Assembleias de Deus|Assemblies of God in Brazil]] were introduced from the United States). Most of the church members live in Brazil, yet the church is also present in other countries: [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], [[Chile]], [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[El Salvador]], [[United States]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Nigeria]], [[Mozambique]], [[Cameroon]] and [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portaliap.com.br/igreja_internacional.php Adventist Church of Promise International] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201134526/http://www.portaliap.com.br/igreja_internacional.php |date=February 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide there are approximately 200,000 Adventists of Promise.

[[File:Surya gifts Yudhishthira the Akshayapatra.jpg|thumb|Surya gifts Yudhishthira the Akshayapatra]]
'''Akshayapatra''' ({{Lang-sa|अक्षयपात्र}}) meaning ''inexhaustible vessel'', is an object from Hindu mythology.  It was a wonderful vessel given to yudishtira by the Lord [[surya]] which held a never-failing supply of food to the [[Pandava]]s every day. 

==Legend==
When the Pandavas were in exile in the forest, they received visits from many dignitaries, sages, kings and ministers who were horrified at the turn of events. They came to discuss matters with the Pandavas and show their support. Draupadi found it very difficult to extend the customary hospitality to these numerous guests because the Pandavas were destitute in exile and living in the forest  where nothing was available.

One day, [[Krishna]] suddenly came to visit the Pandavas. Along with him was his usual retinue of numerous men. The Pandavas received Krishna with traditional ceremony, and they all sat down and began talking happily. However, Draupadi did not come out of the house to greet Krishna. Instead, she was sitting and weeping in the kitchen. After some time, Krishna sensed that something was wrong. He made an excuse of wanting to drink water and entered the kitchen and had a word with her. With tears in her eyes, Draupadi bowed her head before Krishna and showed him (offered him with both hands) an empty pot in which she had cooked rice that morning, and said "This is all I have in my kitchen, Krishna." The pot was empty and she did not have any more rice in the house. But Krishna said to her: "Thank you sister, this is all I need. Look carefully. Is your rice-pot really empty? Can my sister's kitchen ever be empty of food? Look carefully." Draupadi looked, and she found a single grain of rice stuck inside the pot. Krishna said "A single grain of rice, if offered to God with love and humility, becomes the ''beeja'' (primordial seed) which feeds and satiates the whole universe." He then ate that single grain of rice, and at that time, for that day, the whole universe was stomach-full and satiated. There was no hunger in the entire world that day, and of course Krishna's retinue and all of Draupadi's other guests were satiated. This miraculous divine episode happened on the day which is commemorated as "[[Akshaya Tritiya]]" every year, and it occurs around the time of the spring harvest in April-May every year.

Krishna was very sorrowful to see the condition of his sister Draupadi and his cousins, the Pandavas, who were the children of Krishna's father's sister. will hymn 108 chants of lord surya.blessed by this [[surya]] will give him akshaya patra the inexhaustable vessel. Other version mentions different story, [[draupadi]] started to pray to Lord Krishna. Pleased with draupadi's prayers, Lord [[Krishna]] blessed her with the Akshaya Patra, a vessel that would give unlimited food every day till [[Draupadi]] finished eating.

==Akshaya Patra,  Durvasa and Shri Krishna==

During the Pandavas' exile, Durvasa and several disciples arrived at Hastinapura. Duryodhana with his maternal uncle Shakuni managed to gratify the sage. Durvasa was pleased enough to grant him a boon. Duryodhana, secretly wanting Durvasa to curse the Pandavas in anger, asked the sage to visit his cousins in the forest after Draupadi had eaten her meal, knowing that the Pandavas would then have nothing to feed him.

So Durvasa and his disciples visited the Pandavas in their hermitage in the forest, as per Duryodhana's request. During this period of exile, the Pandavas would obtain their food by means of the Akshaya Patra, which would become exhausted each day once Draupadi finished her meal. Because Draupadi had already eaten by the time Durvasa arrived that day, there was no food left to serve him, and the Pandavas were very anxious as to their fate should they fail to feed such a venerable sage. While Durvasa and his disciples were away bathing at the river, Draupadi prayed to Krishna for help. Krishna immediately appeared before Draupadi saying he was extremely hungry, and asked her for food. Draupadi grew exasperated and said she had prayed to Krishna precisely because she had no food left to give. Krishna then told her to bring the Akshaya Patra to him. When she did, he partook of the lone grain of rice and piece of vegetable that he found stuck to the vessel and announced that he was satisfied by the "meal". This satiated the hunger of Durvasa and his disciples, as the satisfaction of Krishna (portrayed here as the Supreme Being who pervades the entire universe) meant the satiation of the hunger of all living things. The sage Durvasa and his disciples then quietly left after their bath, without returning to the Pandavas' hermitage, for they were afraid of facing what they thought would be the Pandavas' wrathful reaction at their impolite behaviour of refusing the food that would be served to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 65|editor=K.S.

The average [[IQ score]] of Ashkenazi Jews has been calculated to be from a range of 108–115 under some studies, which would be significantly higher than that of any other ethnic group in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-11-01|title=On the high intelligence and cognitive achievements of Jews in Britain|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016028960600033X|journal=Intelligence|volume=34|issue=6|pages=541–547|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2006.03.011|issn=0160-2896}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/131053|title=Study: Ashkenazi Jews Smartest on Earth, Partly Due to Diseases|website=Israel National News|language=en|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieet.org/index.php/IEET2/more/pellissier20110719|title=Why is the IQ of Ashkenazi Jews so high?|website=ieet.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence for a group difference in intelligence==

A 2005 paper by three authors who have been linked to theories described as "scientific racism,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Southern Povery Law Center |title=Henry Harpending |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/henry-harpending |website=Southern Poverty Law Center |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cochran|first=Gregory|last2=Hardy|first2=Jason|last3=Harpending|first3=Henry|date=September 2006|title=NATURAL HISTORY OF ASHKENAZI INTELLIGENCE|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-biosocial-science/article/natural-history-of-ashkenazi-intelligence/170E96F5581A9F39524DAC717886D945|journal=Journal of Biosocial Science|volume=38|issue=5|pages=659–693|doi=10.1017/S0021932005027069|issn=1469-7599}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that Ashkenazi Jews as a group inherit higher [[verbal intelligence|verbal]] and [[theory of multiple intelligences#Logical–mathematical|mathematical intelligence]] with somewhat lower spikes in [[spatial intelligence (psychology)|spatial intelligence]] than other ethnic groups, on the basis of inherited diseases and the peculiar economic situation of Ashkenazi [[Jews in the Middle Ages]].

Ashkenazi Jews have had success in a variety of academic fields disproportionate to their small population size, including science, technology, politics, and law.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Chosen Calling: Jews in Science in the Twentieth Century (Medicine, Science, and Religion in Historical Context)  |last=Efron |first=Noah J. |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2014 |isbn= 978-1421413815 |pages=15–16|series=Medicine, Science, and Religion in Historical Context |publication-date=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Ashkenazi Jews have won more than one quarter of [[Fields Medal]]s, [[Turing Award]]s, and [[Regeneron Science Talent Search]] awards. People of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are also disproportionately represented among [[List of Jewish chess players|world chess champions]] (54 percent),&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Abraham's Children: Race, Identity, and the DNA of the Chosen People |last=Entine |first= Jon  |publisher= Grand Central Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-0446580632 |publication-date=October 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Medal of Science Laureate|National Medal of Science]] recipients (37 percent), U.S. [[List of Jewish Nobel laureates|Nobel Prize winners]] (29 percent),&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and Nobel laureates in medicine or physiology (42 percent).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, Jews comprise up to one third of the student populace at Ivy League schools&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and 30 percent of U.S. Supreme Court law clerks.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Intelligence and How to Get It: Why Schools and Cultures Count |last= Nisbett |first=Richard E. |publisher=WW Norton |year=2010 |isbn=978-0393337693 |publication-date=January 26, 2010 |pages=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashkenazi Jews have also had disproportionate success in non-academic fields such as business and commerce. According to the 1931 census of Poland, Jews comprised 9.8 percent of the Polish population but controlled 22.4 percent of the wealth in the country.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Despite their small population, Ashkenazi Jews in Poland also owned 55 percent of large and medium-sized commercial businesses in 1938 and dominated the textile, chemical, food, transportation, paper manufacturing, and building material industries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A more direct approach is to measure intelligence with [[psychometrics|psychometric tests]]. Different studies have found different results, but most have found above-average verbal and [[mathematical logic|mathematical intelligence]] in Ashkenazi Jews, along with below-average spatial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Backman, M. E. (1972) "Patterns of mental abilities: ethnic, socioeconomic and sex differences." ''American Educational Research Journal'', 9, 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, B.M. &amp; Block, Z. (1977) "Goodenough-Harris drawings of Jewish children of orthodox background." ''Psychological Reports'' 41, 155–158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic explanations==
Assuming that today there is a statistical difference in intelligence between Ashkenazi Jews and other ethnic groups, there still remains the question of how much of the difference is caused by genetic factors.

=== "Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence" ===
"Natural History of Intelligence",&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; a 2005 paper by [[Gregory Cochran]], Jason Hardy, and [[Henry Harpending]], put forth the conjecture that the unique conditions under which Ashkenazi Jews lived in medieval Europe [[natural selection|selected]] for high verbal and mathematical intelligence but not spatial intelligence. Their paper has four main premises:
# Today's Ashkenazi Jews have a higher average mathematical and verbal [[IQ]] and an unusual cognitive profile compared to other ethnic groups, including [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] and Oriental Jews.
# From roughly 800 to 1650 [[Common Era|CE]], Ashkenazi Jews in Europe were a mostly isolated genetic group. When Ashkenazi Jews married non-Jews, they usually left the Jewish community; few non-Jews married into the Jewish community.
# During the same period, laws barred Ashkenazi Jews from most jobs, including farming and crafts, and forced them into finance, management, and international trade. Wealthy Jews had several more children per family than poor Jews. So, genes for cognitive traits such as verbal and mathematical talent, which make a person successful in the few fields where Jews could work, were favored; genes for irrelevant traits, such as spatio-visual abilities, were supported by less [[Selection (biology)|selective pressure]] than in the general population.
# Today's Ashkenazi Jews suffer from a number of congenital diseases and mutations at higher rates than most other ethnic groups; these include [[Tay–Sachs disease]], [[Gaucher's disease]],&lt;ref&gt;It has been noted that precisely Jews with Gaucher's disease are likely to work in positions demanding very high IQ. See [http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/nisbett2012int.pdf Nisbett 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bloom's syndrome]], and [[Fanconi anemia]], and mutations at [[BRCA1]] and [[BRCA2]]. These mutations' effects cluster in only a few [[metabolic pathways]], suggesting that they arise from selective pressure rather than [[genetic drift]]. One cluster of these diseases affects [[sphingolipid]] storage, a secondary effect of which is increased growth of [[axons]] and [[dendrites]]. At least one of the diseases in this cluster, [[torsion dystonia]], has been found to correlate with high [[IQ]]. Another cluster disrupts [[DNA]] repair, an extremely dangerous sort of mutation which is lethal in [[homozygotes]]. The authors speculate that these mutations give a cognitive benefit to [[heterozygotes]] by reducing inhibitions to neural growth, a benefit that would not outweigh its high costs except in an environment where it was strongly rewarded.

Other scientists gave the paper a mixed reception, ranging from outright dismissal to acknowledgement that the hypothesis might be true and merits further research.&lt;ref name="Wade" /&gt;

In a television interview, Cochran said:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Laughing Man|title=Hjernevask - Brainwashing (Eng Sub) Part 6 - Race|date=2014-05-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve6uK00AvNo&amp;t=1201|accessdate=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It doesn't have to be extremely heritable for this [intelligence inheritance] to have happened, because you only need small changes in each generation, and there might be forty generations over 1000 years. So if [Ashkenazi Jews] increased a third of an IQ point per generation, that would almost certainly be enough to make this effect happen."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other proposed genetic explanations===
The enforcement of a religious norm requiring Jewish fathers to educate their sons, whose high cost caused voluntary conversions, might explain a large part of a reduction in the size of the Jewish population.&lt;ref name="HandE2007"&gt;Botticini, Maristella; and [[Zvi Eckstein]]. "From Farmers to Merchants, Conversions and Diaspora: Human Capital and Jewish History", September 2007, Vol. 5, No. 5, Pages 885–926 {{DOI|10.1162/JEEA.2007.5.5.885}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Persecution of Jews|Persecution of European Jews]] may have fallen disproportionately on people of lower intelligence.&lt;ref name="Wade"&gt;Wade, Nicholas. [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/03/science/03gene.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5090&amp;en=efcc603583e17b54&amp;ex=1275451200&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss "Researchers Say Intelligence and Diseases May Be Linked in Ashkenazic Genes"], ''The New York Times'', June 3, 2005. Retrieved February 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the genetic explanations===
In medieval Ashkenazi society, wealth, social status, and occupation were largely inherited. The wealthy had more children than the poor, but it was difficult for people born into a poor social class to advance or enter a new occupation. Leading families held their positions for centuries. Without upward social mobility, genes for greater talent at calculation or languages would likely have had little effect on reproductive success. So, it is not clear that mathematical and verbal talent were the prime factors for success in the occupations to which Jews were limited at the time. Social connections, social acumen, willingness to take risks, and access to capital through both skill and [[nepotism]] could have played at least as great a role.&lt;ref name=ferguson /&gt;

On the other hand, controversial research by [[Gregory Clark (economist)|Gregory Clark]] has indicated that social mobility has been consistently low but non-negligible throughout history, and that social mobility was no lower in previous centuries than it has been in recent times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Gregory|authorlink=Gregory Clark (economist)|title=[[The Son Also Rises (book)|The Son Also Rises]]|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic studies have suggested that most Ashkenazi Jewish congenital diseases arose from [[genetic drift]] after a [[population bottleneck]], a phenomenon known as the [[founder effect]], rather than from [[selective pressure]] favoring those genes as called for by the Cochran, ''et al.'' hypothesis.&lt;ref name=ferguson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bray2010 /&gt; To take one example, the mutation responsible for Tay–Sachs disease arose in the 8th or 9th century, when the Ashkenazi Jewish population in Europe was small, just before they spread throughout Europe. The high frequency of this disease among Ashkenazi Jews today might simply be the result of their not marrying outside their group, not because the gene for Tay–Sachs disease confers an advantage that more than makes up for the fact that the disease usually kills by age three.&lt;ref name=ferguson /&gt; However, an examination of the frequencies and locations of the genes for 21 Ashkenazi Jewish congenital diseases suggested that six of them do appear to result from selective pressure, including the mutation for Tay–Sachs disease.&lt;ref name=Bray2010 /&gt; There is still no evidence one way or the other about whether the reason for this is increased intelligence for commercial skills or something else.&lt;ref name=wills /&gt;

Evolutionary psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] suggested that "[t]he most obvious test of a genetic cause of Ashkenazi the advantage would be a cross-adoption study that measured the adult IQ of children with Ashkenazi biological parents and gentile adoptive parents, and vice versa", but noted, "No such study exists, so [Cochran]'s evidence is circumstantial."&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, Steven. "[http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2006_06_17_thenewrepublic.html The Lessons of the Ashkenazism: Groups and Genes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105135315/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2006_06_17_thenewrepublic.html |date=January 5, 2008 }}". ''The New Republic''. Posted June 17, 2006. Retrieved August 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural explanations==
Another type of explanation for higher intelligence in Ashkenazi Jews is differences in culture which tend to promote cultivation of intellectual talents.

For example, after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 [[Common Era|CE]], [[Jewish culture]] replaced its emphasis on ritual with an emphasis on study and scholarship.&lt;ref name=Botticini /&gt; Unlike the surrounding cultures, most Jews, even farmers,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; were taught to read and write in childhood. [[Talmud]]ic [[scholarly method|scholarship]] became a leading key to social status. The Talmudic tradition may have made the Jews well suited for financial and managerial occupations at a time when these occupations provided new opportunities.&lt;ref name=ferguson /&gt;

The emphasis on scholarship came before the Jews turned from agriculture to urban occupations. This suggests that premise #3 of Cochran et al. may have the causal direction backward: mastery of written language enabled Jews to thrive in finance and international trade rather than the other way around.&lt;ref name=ferguson /&gt; Similar cultural traditions continue to the present day, possibly providing a non-genetic explanation for contemporary Ashkenazi Jews' high IQs and prevalence in intellectual fields.&lt;ref name=ferguson/&gt;

Other proposed cultural explanations:

* Talmudic scholarship was so respected in European Ashkenazi Jewish ghetto society that outstanding (though often poor) scholars were highly sought after as husbands for the daughters of even the wealthiest merchants, who could afford to support the married couples. A father who made it possible for the groom to devote himself to Talmud study was performing a mitzvah. This attitude provided selection pressure in favor of intellectual aptitude, and enhanced social mobility.&lt;ref name="Wade" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanner2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ralph E. S. Tanner |title=Chance and Probability: The Limitations of the Social Sciences |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k2KYnWnAlkkC&amp;pg=PA96 |year=2011 |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |isbn=978-81-8069-729-6 |pages=96–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ashkenazi Jews (as well as other ethnic Jews) were marginalized by pogroms and discrimination, and therefore had to put more effort to survive and be outstanding.&lt;ref name="JaušovecPahor2017"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Norbert Jaušove |author2=Anja Pahor|title=Increasing Intelligence |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Go3fDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14|date=30 January 2017|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-12-813430-6|pages=14–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The rise of [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]] created demand for educated professionals with intellectual skills. According to Eckstein and Botticini, between 750 and 900 AD, nearly all the Jews in Mesopotamia and Persia left farming and moved to the big cities of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], where they specialized in jobs more lucrative than farming. Jews had a clear advantage in these professions as a result of centuries of literacy.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1161">The {{nihongo|'''Azuchi religious debate'''|安土宗論|Azuchi shūron}} took place between monks of the [[Nichiren]] and [[Jōdo]] sects of [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhism]], at [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s [[Azuchi Castle]] in 1579.

Nobunaga, who effectively ruled over all of Japan at the time, had a long history of low tolerance for the hypocrisy of violence or competition for power among religious groups. Following a number of disturbances caused by Nichiren followers intolerant of Jōdo thought or practices, Nobunaga sought to resolve the matter through a discussion.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

In the end, he ordered the Nichiren supporters responsible for the disturbances to be executed, including the evangelist [[Fuden Nichimon]]. The Nichiren establishment apologized for its transgressions and promised to be more tolerant in the future, but a large indemnity was still imposed upon it.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

==Early Phase==

===`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan===
[[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book ''[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]''. The eighth and twelfth of the tablets mentioned [[Africa]] and were written on April 19, 1916 and February 15, 1917, respectively. Publication however was delayed in the United States until 1919—after the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The tablets were translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in ''[[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]]'' magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Abbas | first = `Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url =http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá mentions Bahá'ís traveling "…especially from America to Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, and travel through Japan and China. Likewise, from Germany teachers and believers may travel to the continents of America, Africa, Japan and China; in brief, they may travel through all the continents and islands of the globe"&lt;ref name="ToDP8"/&gt; and " …the anthem of the oneness of the world of humanity may confer a new life upon all the children of men, and the tabernacle of universal peace be pitched on the apex of America; thus Europe and Africa may become vivified with the breaths of the Holy Spirit, this world may become another world, the body politic may attain to a new exhilaration…."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, IL |isbn = 0-87743-233-3 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-12.html.iso8859-1 | pages = 82–89 |origyear = 1916-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment of the community===
By early 1952, a Bahá'í [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneer]] had arrived in Angola.&lt;ref name="1st"/&gt; In 1953 [[Shoghi Effendi]], head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá, planned an international teaching plan termed the [[Ten Year Crusade]].&lt;ref name ="history"/&gt;  During the plan pioneers moved to many countries including Angola from places like [[East Timor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Vreeland | first = Claire | authorlink = |author2=Graham Hassall | title = And the trees clapped their hands : stories of Bahá'í pioneers | publisher = George Ronald | contribution = Harold and Florence Fitzner: Knights of Bahá'u'lláh to Portuguese Timor | contribution-url = http://bahai-library.com/hassall_fitzners_portuguese_timor | year = 1994 | location = Oxford, UK | pages = 320–332 | url = http://www.grbooks.com/show_book.php?book_id=4 | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-85398-378-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was during a period of wide scale growth in the religion across [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] near the end of the period of [[Colonisation of Africa]].&lt;ref name="UofC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview Of World Religions |work=General Essay on the Religions of Sub-Saharan Africa |publisher=Division of Religion and Philosophy, [[University of Cumbria]] |url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sub/geness.html |accessdate=2008-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209082606/http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sub/geness.html |archivedate=2007-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1956 the Bahá'í Faith was present in small numbers across 15 countries of southern Africa. To administer these communities a regional National Spiritual Assembly was elected in South West Africa to cover them.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;  An election of a [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] in [[Luanda]] was attempted in 1954&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Pioneer Letters |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1954 | issue = 281 |pages=6–7 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and successfully in 1956.&lt;ref name="silver"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = National Assembly marks silver jubilee |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1981 | issue = 608 |issn=0195-9212 |pages=8–10 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1963 an assembly was known in Luanda and smaller groups of Bahá'ís were in [[Malanje|Malange]] and [[Nova Gaia]].&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;

Following the death of Shoghi Effendi, the elected [[Universal House of Justice]] was head of the religion and began to re-organized the Bahá'í communities of Africa, including Angola, by splitting off national communities to form their own National Assemblies from 1964 though the 1990s.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web

In 1992 the Bahá'ís of [[Angola]] elected their first [[National Spiritual Assembly]], witnessed by Counsellour Rolf von Czekus, representing the Universal House of Justice at the proceedings.&lt;ref name="Rid92"/&gt;

==Modern community==
Since its inception the religion has had involvement in [[socio-economic development]] beginning by giving greater freedom to women,&lt;ref name="iranhistory"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Momen  | first = Moojan | authorlink = Moojan Momen  | title = History of the Baha'i Faith in Iran  | work = draft "A Short Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith"  | publisher = Bahai-library.com  | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_iran#9.%20Social%20and%20economic%20development  | format =   | doi =   | accessdate = 2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kingdon  | first = Geeta Gandhi | title  = Education of women and socio-economic development | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | year = 1997 | url = http://bahai-library.com/kingdon_education_women_development | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics.&lt;ref name="iranhistory"/&gt; The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the [[Universal House of Justice]] dated 20 October 1983 was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Baha'i Faith 1957–1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments | first = Moojan | last = Momen| authorlink = Moojan Momen  |author2=Smith, Peter | year = 1989 |  url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_smith_developments_1957-1988 |volume = 19 | journal = Religion |issue= 1 | pages=63–91 |doi= 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8 |postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the [[Bahá'í teachings]], in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The Angolan Bahá'ís at the local Centre in Luanda hosted an interfaith prayer gathering to mark the opening of the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders, which was held at the United Nations August 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bahá'í International Community | first = | author-link = Bahá'í International Community | title = Baha'is around the world host interfaith prayers for peace | newspaper = Bahá'í International News Service | date = 2000-09-17 | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/63 | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine Bahá’ís from Angola were among the thousand who gathered for a regional conference called for by the [[Universal House of Justice]] to be held in [[Lubumbashi]], Congo, in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bahá'í International Community | first = | author-link = Bahá'í International Community | title = The Lubumbashi Regional Conference | newspaper = Bahá'í International News Service | date = 2008-11-23 | url = http://news.bahai.org/community-news/regional-conferences/lubumbashi.html | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others traveled to the regional conference held in [[Johannesburg]] South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bahá'í International Community | first = | author-link = Bahá'í International Community | title = Big turnout for regional Baha’i conferences | newspaper = Bahá'í International News Service | date = 2008-11-11 | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/668 | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[demonology]], '''Buné''' is a Great Duke of [[Hell]], mighty and strong, who has thirty legions of [[demon]]s under his command. He changes the place of the dead and makes them [[demons]] that are under his power to gather together upon those [[sepulchre]]s. Buné makes men eloquent and wise, and gives true answers to their demands and also richness. He speaks with a deep voice.

Buné is depicted as a three-headed [[dragon]], being his heads like those of a [[dog]], a [[griffin]], and a man (although according to some [[grimoire]]s he has two heads like a [[dragon]] and the third like a man).{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5840">There has been much debate over the '''Christian view on suicide''', with early Christians believing that [[suicide]] is sinful and an act of [[blasphemy]]. In modern times, some Christian churches reject this idea, although others still espouse and teach this view.

==Early Christianity==
In the fifth century, St. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] wrote the book ''[[The City of God]]'', in it making Christianity's first overall condemnation of suicide. His biblical justification for this was the interpretation of the commandment, "[[thou shalt not kill]]", as he sees the omission of "thy neighbor", which is included in "[[thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor]]", to mean that the killing of oneself is not allowed either.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/suicide/#ChrPro Michael Cholbi in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article on Suicide, section 2.2 The Christian Prohibition&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of his reasons were from Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]''.

In the sixth century AD, suicide became a secular crime and began to be viewed as [[Christian views on sin|sinful]]. In 1533, those who committed suicide while accused of a crime were denied a [[Christian burial]]. In 1562, all suicides were punished in this way. In 1693, even [[Failed suicide attempt|attempted suicide]] became an ecclesiastical crime, which could be punished by [[excommunication]], with civil consequences following. In the 13th century, [[Thomas Aquinas]] denounced suicide as an act against God and as a sin for which one could not [[repent]]. Civil and criminal laws were enacted to discourage suicide, and as well as degrading the body rather than permitting a normal burial, property and possessions of the suicides and their families were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//pipsproject.com/Understanding%20Suicide.html |title=Pips Project – THE STIGMA OF SUICIDE A History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317103747/http://pipsproject.com/Understanding%20Suicide.html |archivedate=March 17, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elsinore.ucsc.edu/burial/burialSuicide.html|title=Ophelia's Burial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protestant views ==
{{Bibleverse|Psalm|139:8|KJV}} ("If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.") has often been discussed in the context of the [[Afterlife#Christianity|fate]] of those who commit suicide.&lt;ref name="Dowie 1902 p. 702"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dowie |first=J.

==Modern Catholicism==
{{See also|Declaration on Euthanasia}}
According to the theology of the [[Catholic Church]], [[death]] by suicide is considered a grave matter, one of the elements required for [[mortal sin]].  The reason is that one's life is the property of [[God]] and a gift to the world, and to destroy that life is to wrongly assert dominion over what is God's and was held as despair over salvation. 

In points 2281 and 2325 of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|Catechism]] it is stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''2281''' Suicide contradicts the natural inclination of the human being to preserve and perpetuate his life. It is gravely contrary to the just love of self. It likewise offends love of neighbor because it unjustly breaks the ties of solidarity with family, nation, and other human societies to which we continue to have obligations. Suicide is contrary to love for the living God.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''2325''' Suicide is seriously contrary to justice, hope, and charity. It is forbidden by the fifth commandment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The official ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' indicated that the person who committed suicide may not always be fully right in their mind; and thus not one-hundred-percent morally culpable: "Grave psychological disturbances, anguish, or grave fear of hardship, suffering, or torture can diminish the responsibility of the one committing suicide." The Catholic Church prays for those who have committed suicide, knowing that Christ shall judge the deceased fairly and justly. The Church also prays for the close relations of the deceased, that the loving and healing touch of God will comfort those torn apart by the impact of the suicide.

Formerly, those who committed suicide were denied a Christian funeral. [[Pope Pius X]] said: "In the Fifth Commandment God forbids suicide, because man is not the master of his own life no more than of the life of another. Hence the Church punishes suicide by deprivation of Christian burial." &lt;ref&gt;Pope Pius X. [[Catechism of Saint Pius X]]. Taken from https://www.ewtn.com/library/CATECHSM/PIUSXCAT.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Church Universal and Triumphant''' ('''CUT''') is an international [[New Age]] religious organization founded in 1975 by [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]]. It is an outgrowth (and is now the corporate parent) of [[The Summit Lighthouse]], founded in 1958 by Prophet's husband, [[Mark L. Prophet]]. Its beliefs reflect features of the traditions of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[New Thought]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James R., and J. Gordon Melton, eds. (1994). ''Church Universal and Triumphant in Scholarly Perspective''. Center for Academic Publication. pp. 1–2. {{ISBN|978-0-8191-9634-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The church's headquarters is located near [[Gardiner, Montana]], and the church has local congregations in more than 20 countries.

==Name==
The Catholic Church originated the phrase "[[Church militant and church triumphant|Church Triumphant]]" to refer to Christians in Heaven. The name "Church Universal and Triumphant" was announced by Elizabeth Clare Prophet on July 2, 1973, in a message from the [[ascended master]] Portia.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare, ''Pearls of Wisdom'', vol. 16 no. 51, December 23, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, [[Mary Baker Eddy]] used the terms "universal" and "triumphant" in her first ''Church Manual'' as referring to the church she founded. In the 1903 edition of this work, she capitalized these terms, referring to her church as the "Church Universal and Triumphant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Helen M.|title=Mary Baker Eddy's Church Manual and Church Universal and Triumphant|url=http://www.mbeinstitute.org/chmantri/chmanintro.html|publisher=Mary Baker Eddy Science Institute|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 [[Alice A. Bailey]], in what some students of [[esotericism]] view as a reference to the future organization, prophesied that the religion of the New Age would appear by the end of the 20th century and that it would be called the  ''Church Universal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Alice A.|title=The Externalisation of the Hierarchy|year=1957|publisher=Lucis Publishing Co.|location=New York|page=510}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However Bailey's phrase was "Church Universal," rather than "Church Universal and Triumphant," and on page 152 of Bailey's "A Treatise on White Magic," she indicated that her "Church Universal" was not a church or conventional organization at all but a subjectivity or mystical entity:  "It is that inner group of lovers of God, the intellectual mystics, the knowers of reality who belong to no one religion or organization, but who regard themselves as members of the Church universal and as 'members one of another.'"

==Membership==
The church has never released membership numbers, and its total affiliation is difficult to estimate due to the decentralized, international structure. One author has estimated that the membership peaked at about 10,000 active participants, but sharply declined following a series of crises and controversies in the early to mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=partridge&gt;{{cite book |editor=Partridge, Christopher|title=New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities|year=2004|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York, NY|pages=333–334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
Gordon Melton lists the Church Universal and Triumphant as a religion of the ''Ancient Wisdom'' tradition akin to Theosophy and the [["I AM" Activity]].&lt;ref&gt;Melton, J. Gordon ''Encyclopedia of American Religions'', 5th Edition. New York: 1996. Gale Research. {{ISBN|0-8103-7714-4}}, ISSN 1066-1212 Chapter 18--"The Ancient Wisdom Family of Religions" Pages 151–158; see chart on page 154 listing ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom'' (Ascended Masters); also see Section 18, pages 717–757 Descriptions of various Ancient Wisdom religious organizations, including the Church Universal and Triumphant&lt;/ref&gt;

The church's theology is a [[syncretism|syncretistic]] belief system, including elements of [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], esoteric [[mysticism]], the [[paranormal]] and [[alchemy]], with a belief in [[angel]]s and [[elemental]]s (or spirits of nature). It centers on communications received from [[Ascended Master]]s through the [[Holy Spirit]]. Many of the Ascended Masters, such as [[Sanat Kumara]], [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], [[Djwal Khul]], [[Morya (Theosophy)|El Morya]], [[Kuthumi]], [[Paul the Venetian]], [[Serapis Bey]], the [[Master Hilarion]], the [[Master Jesus]] and [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|Saint Germain]], have their roots in Theosophy and the writings of [[Madame Blavatsky]], [[C.W. Leadbeater]], and [[Alice A. Bailey]]. Others, such as [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Confucius]], are historical religious figures. Some, such as [[Duke of Chou|Lanto]], [[Lady Master Nada]], [[Lady Master Lotus]], and [[Master Lanello|Lanello]], are Ascended Masters who were first identified as such by Elizabeth Clare Prophet. All in all, she identified more than 200 Ascended Masters that were not identified as [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] in the original teachings of Theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press "Profiles of the Ascended Masters"--Pages 13–394 More than 200 "Ascended Masters" are listed&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Prophet, and later his wife, claimed to be Messengers of the Ascended Masters. As such they are able to communicate with the Masters and deliver their instruction to the world. Dictations described as coming directly from the Masters were published weekly as ''Pearls of Wisdom''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Group members practice [[prayer]]s, [[Affirmations (New Age)|affirmations]], [[mantra]]s and a dynamic form of prayer known as "decrees". These serve many purposes: devotion, calling on angels for protection, calling forth the light of God on the earth, praying for healing, for wisdom, seeking to know God's will and for the transmutation of negative karma. One of the most important uses of decrees is to invoke the [[Ascended Master Teachings|violet flame]], claimed to be the most effective method of balancing [[karma]] built up in the past. The doctrine of the [[Seven Rays]] is also taught, as well as teachings about the [[chakra]]s and [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref&gt;These subjects are discuss in many of the Elizabeth Clare Prophet's books. See, for example, ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' (1986), ''Your Seven Energy Centers'' (2000), and ''Reincarnation: The Missing Link in Christianity'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Mark Prophet claims he was first contacted by the Ascended Masters at the age of 18. In 1945 he joined the [[Rosicrucians]] under Max Heindel, working in a branch in [[Saint Louis, Missouri]]. He later affiliated with the [[Self-Realization Fellowship]]. In 1952 Prophet founded a group known as the Ashram, sending out periodic letters received from the Ascended Masters, in particular El Morya.&lt;ref&gt;El Morya, ''Ashram Notes'' (Corwin Springs, Mont.: Summit University Press, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; In about 1956 Mark Prophet came in contact with [[The Bridge to Freedom]], an offshoot of the [[I AM Activity]] led by [[Geraldine Innocente]]. Innocente had been a member of the I AM Activity, but left in 1951 to begin her own group. Prophet studied with the Bridge until 1958 while also continuing with his own Ashram group. On August 7, 1958, Mark sent the final communication to the members of the Ashram, announcing the establishment of The Summit Lighthouse. The founding meeting of The Summit Lighthouse was held in Philadelphia on August 7, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prophet|first=Elizabeth Clare|journal=Pearls of Wisdom|date=1 May 2008|volume=51|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters was in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=TSLHistory&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of The Summit Lighthouse: "The Past Is Prologue"|year=1994|publisher=The Summit Lighthouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Mark met Elizabeth Clare Wulf; they married in 1964 and had four children. Wulf, subsequently Elizabeth Clare Prophet, had grown up under influences including [[New Thought Movement|New Thought]] and [[Christian Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prophet|first=Elizabeth Clare|title=In My Own Words|year=2009|publisher=Summit University Press|location=Gardiner, Mont.|isbn=978-1-932890-15-0|pages=52–62, 106–15, 131–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1966, the Prophets moved their church to Colorado Springs, Colorado. In 1970, a second major center of the organization was established in Santa Barbara, California. The first session of Ascended Master University – a religious study center for teaching of the ancient wisdom – was held there in July 1970. (Ascended Master University was later renamed Summit University.){{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

On November 2, 1971, the church opened a branch of Montessori International, a private school based on the principles of Italian educator [[Maria Montessori]]. In later years, the school was expanded to provide a full program from preschool to Grade 12. On May 1, 1972, the church opened the Four Winds Organic Center in Colorado Springs, a [[health food store]] and organic restaurant. On February 26, 1973, Mark Prophet died, leaving his wife as leader.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Church Universal and Triumphant was initially incorporated as a separate organization on May 1, 1975, later becoming the parent organization for The Summit Lighthouse. The organization moved its headquarters to Pasadena, California, in 1976. In 1978, it moved to "Camelot," a {{convert|218|acre|km2|adj=on}} property in the Santa Monica Mountains, outside of Los Angeles.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In 1981, the organization purchased a {{convert|12000|acre|km2|adj=on}} property in [[Montana]], on the northern border of [[Yellowstone National Park]], which it named the [[Royal Teton Ranch]]. Camelot was sold and the organization moved its headquarters to Montana in 1986.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The church became well known during the late 1980s when it predicted a period of heightened danger of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] at the end of that decade. Members were urged to prepare by building [[fallout shelter]]s and supplying them with food and other necessities.&lt;ref name=Herald&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''Calgary Herald''|title=Church under fire|author=Lorraine Locherty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some adherents incurred significant debts in preparing shelters. When nuclear war failed to occur, Prophet claimed that the community had averted the war through their prayers.

With changes in employment laws for non-profit organizations and a decline in U.S. membership, the church was forced to downsize its headquarters staff in the late 1990s and the first years of the 2000s. In July 1996 Elizabeth Clare Prophet handed over the day-to-day running of the organization to a new president and board of directors, who oversaw this major restructuring of operations at the church headquarters. Portions of the Royal Teton Ranch were sold to the U.S. government as part of a complex sale and land-exchange agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wald|first=Matthew L.|title=Federal Land Deal Protects Yellowstone Herd and Geysers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/22/us/federal-land-deal-protects-yellowstone-herd-and-geysers.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second large property that had been purchased in 1983 was sold on the open market, along with other smaller landholdings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Since the early 1990s church membership has fallen in the United States. Controversy in the media and Prophet's retirement were likely significant factors leading to this decline. However, the CUT remains a significant presence in the area of its headquarters, and centers continue to be active in large cities across the nation.

Due to health reasons, Prophet retired in 1999 and died in 2009.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Controversy==
Along with many other [[new religious movement]]s, Church Universal and Triumphant has been described as a [[cult]],&lt;ref name=Herald/&gt;&lt;ref name=cult/&gt; especially in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Articles and letters critical of the church were published in the local newspapers the ''Livingston Enterprise'' and the ''Bozeman Chronicle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Oregonian|date=March 17, 1990|title=Montana Residents Leery Of Activity Around Church Universal Property|author=Jeanie Senior|quote=Chris Gilbert, 16, who is a junior at Park High in nearby Livingston, told the Livingston Enterprise that after he moved in with a Livingston family, his mother visited him at his part-time job to warn him 'something might happen.' He said she invited him to rejoin his family in the church's fallout shelters. Church members have built a network of more than 40 such shelters.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the letters were written by former church members who raised lawsuits against the church.&lt;ref name=cult&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The New York Times|date=April 26, 1986|title='Cults' And The Aged: A New Family Issue|author=Andree Brooks|quote=What is believed to be the first jury decision in this area was handed down this month. Gregory Mull, a 64-year-old architect, was awarded $1.6 million in damages in a suit against the Church Universal and Triumphant, a spiritual organization with headquarters in Malibu, Calif.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the church was accused of using [[sleep deprivation]] to control its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Church Blamed for Stroke |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5019423/mark_l_prophet_19181973/|newspaper=Santa Cruz Sentinel|date=February 14, 1986|page=18|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = April 23, 2016}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public scrutiny intensified in 1989 when it was discovered that the Church Universal and Triumphant was building fallout shelters and that members of the church, including Vernon Hamilton and vice president and husband of Elizabeth Clare Prophet, Edward Francis, had purchased weapons illegally. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]], state, and local law enforcement agencies subsequently investigated the church. The BATF investigation resulted in Francis being sentenced to one month in prison and three months' house detention and Vernon Hamilton being sentenced to three months' probation after spending 11 days in jail in Spokane, Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eng|first=James L.|title=Montana Church Member Spared Jail Time for Illegal Weapons Purchase|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/Montana-Church-Member-Spared-Jail-Time-for-Illegal-Weapons-Purchase/id-81fcca81a2400cde0d904cc881dcff3f|work=AP News Archive|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the government scrutiny, the church made several changes to its operations, including the appointment of a number of independent directors to its governing board.

In the summer of 1993, a team of academic specialists conducted an interdisciplinary study of the church and its members. They published their results in ''Church Universal and Triumphant in Scholarly Perspective'', edited by James R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton. These scholars rejected the negative stereotype of the organization as a cult. Lewis characterized the organization and its leaders as one that was "trying to do the good" and as "one of the most intrinsically interesting religious communities to have come into being in this century."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James R., and J. Gordon Melton, eds. (1994). ''Church Universal and Triumphant in Scholarly Perspective''. Center for Academic Publication. pp. vii-xiv. {{ISBN|978-0-8191-9634-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have cast doubt on these conclusions. [[Robert Balch]] and Stephan Landgon, participlants in the Lewis/Melton study, criticized it for elements of [[groupthink]], failure to observe frontstage and back stage behavior and other research errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dorofeyeva|first=L.

==21st century==
Elizabeth Prophet developed [[Alzheimer's disease]] in the late 1990s, and in 1999 she retired from active involvement with the organization. From then until her death on October 15, 2009 at the age of 70, she lived in [[Bozeman, Montana]] under house care. The church continued its work under the direction of a presidency with a [[board of directors]] and a council of elders.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Prophet's legal guardian, Murray Steinman, said she suffered from advanced Alzheimer's disease and died at her apartment.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, Oct. 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years several former members of the church have come forward claiming to deliver dictations from the Ascended Masters. In 1995 former minister Monroe Shearer and his wife, Carolyn, founded The Temple of The Presence, now based in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. In 2005, another former church official, David C. Lewis, set up his own new Ascended Master Teachings group called The Hearts Center which is based in [[Livingston, Montana]]. Mark and Elizabeth Prophet both spoke about plans for future messengers to follow after them, and the organization has a mechanism by which future messengers may be recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Church Universal and Triumphant|title=Articles of Incorporation|page=Article X, Section 1}}The mechanism for recognizing future messengers is largely unchanged since the original Articles of Incorporation for the church were filed with the state of Montana on May 1, 1975. The church's Council of Elders is the governing body responsible for recognizing future messengers.&lt;/ref&gt; However, no other claimant to the office of messenger has thus far been recognized by the church.

CUT continues to hold quarterly retreats at the Royal Teton Ranch and to hold Summit University sessions and retreats for teens and young adults around the world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

* ''Violet Flame'', an hour-long two-part documentary, was originally recorded and produced by [[Brenda Hutchinson]] for New American Radio in the Winter of 1993 (http://soundprint.org/radio/display_show/ID/89/name/Violet+Flame ). Hutchinson lived for three months at the headquarters for the Church Universal and Triumphant where she met and recorded members of the Church. The piece explores the political and religious philosophy from over 40 hours of recordings of chanting, services, rituals and the recorded stories and conversations with Church members and Officials, including Elizabeth Clare Prophet. Brenda revisited the Church ten years later, primarily to interview the growing and grown children she first met during her earlier visit. This ''New Violet Flame'' was commissioned and first broadcast on [[National Public Radio]] by ''Soundprint'' in 2002. It was awarded the Gracie Allen Award for short documentary from the [[American Women in Radio and Television]] in 2003.

===Non-fiction books===
* Kenneth and Talita Paolini, the parents of [[Inheritance cycle]] author [[Christopher Paolini]], were once members but later left the organization. They have since written the book ''400 Years of Imaginary Friends: A Journey Into the World of Adepts, Masters, Ascended Masters, and Their Messengers'', which discussed their experiences of the sect as well as a history of it related to other groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/c/churchtriumph/cutbook.htm Former Church Universal and Triumphant Members Publish Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Church of Our Father''' was the first Unitarian church established in Atlanta, Georgia. The church was organized on March 27, 1883, by Rev. George Leonard Chaney, a Boston minister.  Rev. Chaney initially held Sunday services in the Senate Chamber, Concordia Hall and the United States Courtroom.  A church building was constructed at the corner of North Forsyth and Church Street and dedicated on April 23, 1884. The original building was demolished in 1900.

The church continued to serve Atlanta’s liberal religious community for more than six decades.  During that time the church name was changed several times.  In 1918, Atlanta’s Unitarians merged with the city’s Universalist congregation.  The combined congregation collapsed in 1951.

== History ==

== Unitarian churches in the South ==

From its founding in 1825, the southern church expansion of the Boston-based [[American Unitarian Association]] (AUA) was hampered by the liberal Unitarian theology perceived in the south as religious heresy and the AUA’S adoption in 1837 of it abolition advocacy.  Prior to the Civil War, Unitarian churches were operating in Richmond, Virginia; Augusta and Savannah, Georgia; Mobile, Alabama; Louisville, Kentucky; Charleston, South Carolina and New Orleans, Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Gibson |first=George |date=1970 |title=Unitarian Congregations in Ante-Bellum Georgia |jstor=40579063 |magazine=The Georgia Historical Quarterly |location= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the Civil War, only the churches in Louisville, Charleston and New Orleans were active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Eliot |first=Samuel |date=1919 |title=The Southern Field |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s8_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1087&amp;dq=%22The+courtesy+of+the+editor+of+the+Christian+Register%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C8roVNC4OYK7ggTdh4HoDA&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20courtesy%20of%20the%20editor%20of%20the%20Christian%20Register%22&amp;f=false |magazine=Christian Register, Volume 98 |location=Boston, MA |publisher= The Christian Register Incorporated|access-date=May 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For years after the war, the AUA made no effort to regain or expand its southern churches. This non-engagement policy was reversed at the January 10, 1881 meeting of the directors of the AUA.  The directors authorized Rev. John Heywood to conduct a tour of general missionary work in the south and requested that Rev. Enoch Powell perform missionary work specifically in Atlanta.  Six months after Rev. Powell’s initial Atlanta trip, the AUA directors allocated $1,000 for Atlanta missionary work and requested that Rev. Chaney lead that effort.

Years later Rev. Chaney noted, “They had sent a young minister to spy out the land, who promptly returned with the tidings of ‘nothing doing’ or to be done in Atlanta. I was then a member of the Executive Board of the Association and very zealous in sending other ministers into the field. So, for very shame, when I was asked to go myself, I could not refuse.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Chaney |first=George Leonard |date=1916 |title=Some Notes on Unitarian Church Extension at the South|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtg_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA467&amp;dq=%22some+notes+on+Unitarian+church+extension+at+the+south%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR9-za-t7KAhVB7iYKHQfPB3wQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22some%20notes%20on%20Unitarian%20church%20extension%20at%20the%20south%22&amp;f=false |magazine=Christian Register, Volume 95 |location=Boston, MA |publisher= The Christian Register Incorporated|access-date=2013-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Timing of Atlanta missionary work ===

The resumption of missionary work in Atlanta coincided with the city’s recovery from the Civil War.  By the 1880’s Atlanta was experiencing a building boom and the 1881 [[International Cotton Exposition]] brought favorable national attention to the city.  More specifically to the Unitarian southern expansion effort, the idea of the exposition originated with a Bostonian Unitarian, Edward Atkinson.  Atkinson subsequently served on the exposition’s executive committee with Georgia Governor Colquitt and prominent citizens of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Garrett |first=Franklin |date=1969 |title=Atlanta and Environs: A Chronicle of Its People and Events, Vol II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7qpif6-Z5o4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=atlanta+and+environs+vol+2&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjsh53IirXZAhVJ5IMKHUCqDvYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=atlanta%20and%20environs%20vol%202&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=University of Georgia Press, Athens |pages=19–21 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If not directly influencing the timing of the AUA’s action, the relationships established by Atkinson were leveraged by the AUA directors in their Atlanta expansion strategy.

Upon the arrival of Rev. Powell in Atlanta in January 1881, the city newspaper reported that Unitarian services would be held in that state’s senate chambers “by the courtesy of Governor Colquitt."  In February 1882 when Rev. Chaney arrived in Atlanta, [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|''The Atlanta Constitution'']] newspaper included in his biographical background that Rev. Chaney “has labored for the cause of industrial education with Mr. Edward Atkinson, of Boston.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff Writer | title= NONE| url= | format= | agency=The Atlanta Constitution| publisher= | pages= 7 | date= February 26, 1882 | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Church of Our Father founded ===

In March 1883, approximately one year after Rev. Chaney first arrived in Atlanta, he announced “that the time had come for giving organized form to the interest we felt on the establishment of a new church in Atlanta."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite archive |first= |last= |item = Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Atlanta Records |item-url = |type = |item-id = |date = |page= |pages= |fonds = |series = |file = Unitarian Church of Atlanta - Minutes, Book I, 1884-1909|box= 25|collection = Atlanta, GA.

A month later, in April 1883, the committee reported that a lot had been secured with funds provided by the AUA.  A church building was soon erected on the corner of Forsyth and Church Streets and dedicated on the evening of April 23, 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff writer | title= Given to God. The Church of Our Father, on Church Street, Formally Dedicated| url= | format= | agency=The Atlanta Constitution| publisher= | pages= 5 | date=24 April 1884 | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church remained at this location until 1899 when the church property was sold to the Carnegie Library Trustees for the construction of Atlanta’s first public library.  A new church building was constructed nearby at the corner of Spring and Forsyth Streets and dedicated in January 1900.

=== Name change ===
A proposal to rename the church to the "First Unitarian Church of Atlanta" was offered during the January 1901 church annual meeting but was voted down. The timing of the initiative to change the church's name may have been influenced by the dedication a year earlier of the new First Universalist Church of Atlanta building on East Harris Street.  The two denominations shared liberal faith principles and had a sense of common bond in the otherwise orthodox faith environment in Atlanta.

Three years later another effort was made to rename the church.  On April 17, 1904 members were asked to vote on two names; “Church of Our Father, Unitarian” or “First Unitarian Church of Atlanta.”  Both names failed to achieve the required two-thirds majority.  However, after a request by one member to change his ballot, the vote to change the name to the First Unitarian Church of Atlanta carried by that single vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite archive |first= |last= |item = Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Atlanta Records |item-url = |type = textual data - Meeting Minutes |item-id = |date = April 17, 1904|page= |pages= |fonds = |series = Historical Files|file = Unitarian Church of Atlanta - Minutes, Book I, 1884-1909|box= 25|collection = Atlanta, GA.

=== New building, merger and name change ===

The Unitarians sold their second church building and built their third church on West Peachtree Street in 1915.  This new church building located between Third Avenue and Kimball Street (now Ponce de Leon) included a set of stained glass windows known as the Founders’ Windows.  The name was derived from an inscription on the windows reading “In Honor of George Leonard Chaney - Caroline Isabel Chaney”.  Rev. Chaney and his wife Isabel were both present as the hymn of dedication was sung by the then pastor, Rev. Joseph Wade Conkling.

Three years later Atlanta’s Universalists joined their fellow liberal colleagues in this church building in what was described as a temporary merger for the duration of [[World War I]].  This merger of local Atlanta Unitarians and Universalists appears to have been influenced by a December 1917 recommendation by the AUA.  As a war economy effort, the AUA recommended that churches consider federation or combination for the “winter or the duration of the war.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Eliot |first=Samuel |date=1917 |title=Winning the War in the Churches |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_cfAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1204&amp;lpg=PA1204&amp;dq=%22Resolved,+That+the+Directors+of+the+Association+recommend+that+the+churches+give+careful+consideration+to+the+possibilities+%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N-ovwbT2Ma&amp;sig=dH2CS63aWlzXgTztiN6Gvuh6z-Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRi7ul5a3OAhWD7SYKHSBxC3UQ6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Resolved%2C%20That%20the%20Directors%20of%20the%20Association%20recommend%20that%20the%20churches%20give%20careful%20consideration%20to%20the%20possibilities%20%22&amp;f=false |magazine=The Unitarian Register, Volume 98|location=Boston, MA |publisher= The Christian Register Association|access-date=May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The merger was announced in a February 23, 1918, article in ''The Atlanta Constitution''. "The Unitarian and Universalists of Atlanta will meet in public worship at the Unitarian Church, 301 West Peachtree street, tomorrow morning at 11 o’clock.  This is the first meeting under a temporary merger of the two congregations which is planned to last for the duration of the war.  Rev. T.B. Fisher, the retiring minister of the Universalist church, will preach on 'The Larger Destiny.'  All friends are cordially invited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff Writer | title= Unitarian| url= | format= | agency=The Atlanta Constitution| publisher= | pages= 6 | date= February 23, 1918 | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The merger of the two denominations, however, continued long after the conclusion of the war in November 1918.

In a 1940 report commissioned by the [[Universalist Church of America]] (UCA), Rev. Frederic Perkins observed that the two small liberal communities merged and continued together primarily to offset separate weaknesses. Both churches had exhibited limited growth despite the expansion of Atlanta’s population and both had remained dependent on the financial assistance from their respective national organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite archive |first=Frederic W. |last=Perkins |item = Report on Atlanta Church|item-url = |type = textual record|item-id = |date = April 3, 1940|page= |pages= |fonds = |series = |file = Atlanta, GA.

Outwardly the merger appeared successful.  Once combined, the Unitarians and Universalists renamed their joint church the Liberal Christian Church.  The Universalist church building on East Harris Street was sold in April 1920 for $20,000 and the proceeds were set aside to assist the newly federated congregation.  The Women's Mission Circle from the Universalist church and the Woman's Alliance organization from the Unitarian church were merged into a single Woman's Union organization.  The Universalist's [[Young People's Christian Union]] (Y.P.C.U.) became the basis for youth religion education for the new church.  Ministers were selected from both the Unitarian and Universalist denominations.  Eight years later in 1926, the members changed the church name again to the United Liberal Church.  However, publicly the church was commonly known as the Unitarian-Universalist Church.

== Seeds of discord ==

The Unitarians may have newly arrived in Atlanta, but the Universalists had long established churches in the rural Georgia countryside and carried their southern traditions into the city. The pastor of the church shortly after the merger, Rev. Earnest J. Bowden, raised an alarm that social differences threatened the federated church. "It grits our people badly to see a man chewing a quid of tobacco all through service or to see another rise from his seat and spit out the window.  Then there are contra charges of snobbishness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite archive |first=Ernest  |last=Bowden |item = Rev. Bowden Letter to Dr. Eliot |item-url = |type = textual record |item-id = |date = June 29, 1925 |page= |pages= |fonds = |series = Individual Correspondence |file = Bowden, Rev.

Fifteen years later Rev. Frederic Perkins echoed Bowden's comments in his 1940 report. "If the urban Unitarian sometimes failed to appreciate the rural Universalist, the latter was sometimes unduly sensitive and imagined slights that were not intended. But the sense of separateness was there, close to the surface ready to aggravate the frictions that weakness is apt to engender in a small church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite archive |first=Frederic W. |last=Perkins |item = Report on Atlanta Church|item-url = |type = textual record|item-id = |date = April 3, 1940|page= |pages= |fonds = |series = |file = Atlanta, GA.

The changing social environment in post World War II America further exacerbated fissures in church social unity.  During the short ministry (1947-1948) of the Massachusetts-born Universalist Rev. Isaiah Jonathan Domas, external and internal pressures gave birth to the beginning of the end of the liberal church presence in Atlanta.

=== Communism ===

Churchill's 1946 declaration that an [[iron curtain]] had descended across Europe ushered in an era of a global Communist [[red scare]].  The Atlanta church was swept up in this global phenomena with a fear that their new minister was a communist sympathizer. Rev. Domas's support of [[Henry A. Wallace]] and his 1948 presidential third-party candidacy was evidence enough to some church members that his liberal politics were out of step with southern traditions. Domas's association with the poet and union organizer [[Don West (educator)|Don West]] further solidified his public image as a leftist.

An August 1948 editorial by [[Ralph McGill]] of ''The Atlanta Constitution'' was blunt in its assessment.  "Don West, who has served here and there in the South as a preacher, teacher and Communist organizer as well as a contributor in the Communist Daily Worker, turns up on a farm outside Douglasville, Ga., which he has rented or leased to a Unitarian Church Youth project." McGill continued, "This fact will cause most of the local Unitarian Church members to fret even more than they are.  They are convinced that the Communist Party has caused the Unitarian Church, because of its liberal policy, to be selected for infiltration purposes and for use in various Communist front purposes." 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Ralph McGill | title= The Unitarian Have Reason to Fret| url= | format= | agency=The Atlanta Constitution| publisher= | pages= 14 | date= August 13, 1948 | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This public association with Communism of the Atlanta Unitarian church and its minister did not go unnoticed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In Don West's FBI file the following was noted, "On one occasion, while West was in the congregation of this church, Domas read one of West's poems, asked West to stand, and introduced him as an example for the members of the congregation to follow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/fbifiles/West_Donald_L.-HQ-9_text.pdf |title=100-376340-1 p. 1-3 |last= |first= |date= |website=The Black Vault |publisher= |access-date=July 31, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Segregation ===
As the church wrestled with public insinuations of Communist complicity, a real assault on long-standing and fundamental southern segregation policies was underway. In 1944 the Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' declared unconstitutional the white-only primary system long used by southern Democrats to restrict minority voting rights.  Four years later, President Harry S. Truman would sign [[Executive Order 9981]], ending segregation in the United States Armed Forces. Change to southern Jim Crow traditions was afoot.

Rev. Domas, in both words and action, reflected this change.

Upon arrival in Atlanta, he took a one day a week job at [[Clark Atlanta University|Atlanta University]], a predominately black college. Rev. Domas also reserved the right to meet with whomever he chose in his home. That company included Dr. Thomas Baker Jones, a black Unitarian from Ohio.  Rev. Domas considered it a "heart-sickening duty"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite archive |first=Isaiah Jonathan  |last= Domas |item = Minister's Annual Report |item-url = |type = textual record |item-id = |date = January 29, 1948 |page= |pages= |fonds = |series = Subseries D |file = Domas, Isaiah J.

Nonetheless, Dr. Jones attended a Sunday service in November 1947.

Rev. Domas recounted the event. "He was seated without incident, even to the taking of his offering ... but the matter was hardly allowed to rest there. An ultra-race conscious minority promptly rushed to the telephone and served notice on those two members of the board with whom they felt they had the most in common that I should be fired forthwith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite archive |first=Isaiah Jonathan  |last= Domas |item = Letter to Congregation |item-url = |type = textual record |item-id = |date = April 21, 1948 |page= |pages= |fonds = |series = Subseries D |file = Domas, Isaiah J.

Rev. Domas's daughter described what happened next as seen from the parsonage located next to the West Peachtree Street church.

"When the [[Ku Klux Klan]] threatened our family in the fall of 1947, I was too young to be told and too short to look out the high windows. If I saw anything alarming it was the odd way my parents stared at the street. My mother stood on one side of a closed drape, my father on the other. Each lifted just enough cloth to let in a sharp slice of Georgia sunlight. On West Peachtree Street, two floors below, a convoy of battered cars and rusty pickup trucks stretched from Third Street to Ponce de Leon. Each was full of Klansmen in white robes tilting back their pointed hoods to hunt for motion behind our drapes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reed |first=Claude |date= June 1, 2010 |title=Crazy for Justice, the Optimism of a Blacklisted Minister |url= |location= |publisher= unpublished|page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several weeks later the church voted to exclude Negroes from all church functions.  The local newspaper reported the news with an article entitled "Wallacite's Church Votes Negro Ban".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff Writer | title= Wallacite's Church Votes Negro Ban| url= | format= | agency=The Atlanta Constitution| publisher= | pages= 3A | date= March 28, 1948 | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rev. Domas offered his resignation to the Board of Trustees and the church subsequently voted to accept his resignation by a vote of 33 to 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff Writer | title= Pro-Wallace Pastor Here Quits Post| url= | format= | agency=The Atlanta Constitution| publisher= | pages= 2 | date= May 7, 1948 | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Response ===
At its May 1948 meeting, the Unitarian Ministers' Association responded to the actions taken by the church by refusing to send any future candidates to Atlanta until the church reversed its segregationist policy.  At the October 1950 meeting of the AUA Board of Directors, a recommendation was made and later accepted that both the Universalist Church of America and the American Unitarian Association withdraw support from the Atlanta congregation. In September 1951, the AUA sold the church building on West Peachtree Street and the church was officially disbanded.

== Renewed efforts in Atlanta ==
Following the sale of the church building and the disbanding of the original congregation, the Universalist Church of America and the American Unitarian Association coordinated efforts to raise a new liberal church in Atlanta.  Rev. Glenn O. Canfield was dispatched to the city in early 1952.  He successfully regrouped several former members and attracted new members and re-chartered the United Liberal Church.  In 1966, the church changed its name to the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Atlanta (UUCA).

'''Devi Balika Vidyalaya''' is a public national girls’ school in [[Colombo]], Sri Lanka. Girls are admitted at grade six, based on the results of an island-wide [[scholarship examination]]. Like other national schools it is controlled by the [[Government of Sri Lanka|central government]], as opposed to a provincial council.

== History ==

By 1950 some of the recommendations of the [[Kannangara report]] had been implemented, but the opportunities for educational equality remained inadequate. The state accepted the recommendation of the White Paper on education (1950), to split education at grade 8, when compulsory education ended. One of the three streams was academic. In keeping with this policy, Government Girls' College, Castle Street (Devi Balika Vidyalaya) began to offer classes from grade 9 to 12, catering to academically gifted girls. The Department of Education further intended this new school to be a centre of excellence in science education, for which there was great demand after [[World War II]].

The school was founded on 15 January 1953, constructed with prefabricated material, enrolling 53 students and hosting 5 teachers.

The importance of extra curricular activities was recognized though the emphasis was on academic pursuits. [[Girl Guide|Girl Guiding]], dancing ([[Kandyan]], Indian and country dancing), music, sports and drama were introduced.

Wimala de Silva (Late Deshabandu Dr. (Mrs.) Wimala de Silva) was its founder principal.

A hostel was established in 1997 with the help of alumnae. On 5 March 1998 a School Multipurpose Auditorium was opened. Fundraising projects were held to swell the fund to match the grant given by the Ministry of Education. In addition, financial contributions received from other ministries, ''Pelpola Vipassi Foundation'', various institutions, parents, and alumnae were a major support in doing this task. Engineering and Architectural consultancy and various free services received from supporters, made the 1st and 2nd stages of the School Multipurpose Auditorium Project a success.

'''''Dos Abend Blatt'''''  (''The Evening Paper''; original extensive title {{lang-yi|אבענד בלאטט פון דיא ארבייטער צייטונג}}; ''{{lang|yi-Latn|Abend blatt fun di arbayter tsaytung}}'') was a Yiddish language daily newspaper published in [[New York City]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name="p29"&gt;Diner, Hasia R. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=amip4p2rjk0C In the Almost Promised Land: American Jews and Blacks, 1915-1935]''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1995. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dos Abend Blatt'' was launched as an outgrowth of the weekly ''Di Arbeter Tsaytung'' (''Workman's Paper'').&lt;ref name="fth"&gt;Michaels, Tony ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DwTXyNMiYAgC A Fire in Their Hearts; Yiddish Socialists in New York]'', Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2005. p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Published between 1894 and 1902, it was an organ of the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]] (SLP).&lt;ref&gt;Soltes, Mordecai. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=__hCUf2PjHUC The Yiddish Press, an Americanizing Agency]''. American education--its men, ideas, and institutions. New York: Arno Press, 1969. p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dos Abend Blatt'' was the first [[socialism|socialist]] Yiddish daily to appear in New York.&lt;ref name="p29"/&gt; During its early phase, ''Dos Abend Blatt'' rivaled the readership of the [[anarchism|anarchist]] ''[[Freie Arbeiter Stimme]]'' and, later, the bourgeois-orthodox ''Yiddisher Tagesblatt''.&lt;ref&gt;Kosak, Hadassa. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rXlIj13jAtIC Cultures of Opposition: Jewish Immigrant Workers, New York City, 1881-1905]''. SUNY series in American labor history. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2000. p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper was sponsored by the [[United Hebrew Trades]].&lt;ref name="uhc"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1Z77HAVP2BoC American Journalism, 1690-1940]''. London: Routledge, 2000. Vol. 3. pp. 175-176&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, ''Dos Abend Blatt'' argued in favour of an [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] line, denouncing national chauvinism, labor nationalism and [[Zionism]]. It called on Jewish workers to unite along class lines, rather than building an identity around their language and/or religion (''[[Yiddishkeit]]''). Regarding [[antisemitism]], ''Dos Abend Blatt'' argued that the problem had economic roots and thus Jewish nationalism was not an adequate answer. However, the news section of the paper carried frequent reports on antisemitism and [[pogrom]]s around the world.&lt;ref name="jac"/&gt;

In 1897 a split erupted amongst the Jewish cadres of the SLP. A dissident minority group was expelled in June 1897. The majority group, represented by Philip Krantz, Benjamin Feygenbaum, Jacob Milch and Joseph Schlossberg, retained control over ''Dos Abend Blatt''. The dissidents founded a new Yiddish socialist newspaper, ''[[The Forward|Forverts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, Jonathan. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-ycwctuCSpQC Prophecy and Politics: Socialism, Nationalism, and the Russian Jews, 1862-1917]''. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press, 1984. p. 467&lt;/ref&gt; Competition between ''Forverts'' and ''Dos Abend Blatt'' became fierce, a contest which ''Dos Abend Blatt'' would eventually lose. Two political issues, in which ''Forverts'' adopted a far more pragmatic approach in appealing to Jewish communal sentiments, proved decisive in the competition; the [[Dreyfus affair]] and the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref name="mar"&gt;Bell, Daniel. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XXM5z8ja3XUC Marxian Socialism in the United States]''. Cornell paperbacks. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1996. p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the Dreyfus affair, ''Dos Abend Blatt'' found itself at loggerheads with large sectors of the Jewish community. The editor of the paper, Philip Krantz, questioned the innocence of [[Alfred Dreyfus|Dreyfus]]. This position would prove largely unpopular amongst the Yiddish-speaking community.&lt;ref name="jac"&gt;Jacobson, Matthew Frye. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-BoND7xOy5wC Special Sorrows: The Diasporic Imagination of Irish, Polish, and Jewish Immigrants in the United States]''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1995. pp. 62-63, 150&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Cuba war, ''Dos Abend Blatt'' was one of the first newspapers to voice opposing to the policies of the American government.&lt;ref name="hk"/&gt; The paper, through the editorials of Krantz and Benjamin Feygenbaum, opposed the nationalist fervour that the war aroused, and argued that the war was carried out for the benefit of the dominant classes, that Cuba would not be liberated but put under American rule and that the working class was suffering the losses at the battlefield. The paper argued against the discourse that [[Spain]] was an eternal enemy of the Jewish people.&lt;ref name="hk"&gt;Jacobson, Matthew Frye. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-BoND7xOy5wC Special Sorrows: The Diasporic Imagination of Irish, Polish, and Jewish Immigrants in the United States]''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1995. pp. 146-147, 150-151&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1899 the SLP split into two. Those loyal to [[Daniel De Leon]] retained control over ''Dos Abend Blatt'', but several prominent members (such as Krantz and Feygenbaum) had joined the other camp and subsequently left the paper.&lt;ref name="fra"&gt;Frankel, Jonathan. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-ycwctuCSpQC Prophecy and Politics: Socialism, Nationalism, and the Russian Jews, 1862-1917]''. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press, 1984. p. 473&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, there was an attempt to popularize ''Dos Abend Blatt'' amongst the Jewish community, through introduction of 'Jewish News' and 'Jewish Letters' (from abroad) sections. However, this shift in editorial policy gave little benefit, as ''Forverts'' had already won over major sections of readership by consistently appealing to the notion of ''Yiddishkeit''.&lt;ref name="p27"&gt;Jacobson, Matthew Frye. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-BoND7xOy5wC Special Sorrows: The Diasporic Imagination of Irish, Polish, and Jewish Immigrants in the United States]''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1995. p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dos Abend Blatt'' and ''Di Arbeter Tsaytung'' both terminated publication in 1902.&lt;ref name="fra"/&gt;

'''Dousing''' is the practice of making something or someone wet by throwing liquid over them, e.g., by pouring water, generally cold, over oneself. A related practice is [[ice swimming]]. Some consider cold water dousing to be a form of [[ascetic]]ism.

== Cold water dousing ==
Cold water dousing is used to "shock" the body into a kind of [[fever]]. The body's reaction is similar to the [[mammalian diving reflex]] or possibly temperature [[biofeedback]]. Several meditative and awareness techniques seem to share similar effects with elevated temperature, such as [[Tummo]]. Compare cold water dousing with [[ice swimming]].

The effects of dousing are usually more intense and longer-lasting than just a cold [[shower]]. Ending a shower with cold water is an old [[naturopathic]] tradition. There are those who believe that this fever is helpful in killing harmful [[bacteria]] and leaving the hardier beneficial bacteria in the body.

== National traditions ==
=== Burma ===
* [[Thingyan]] (Water Festival) was celebrated from 13 to 17 April in 2001 and the rituals included dousing.

=== Japan ===
* Some Japanese [[ascetic]] practices, as with [[Shinto]] [[misogi]] practices, include dousing. This is seen, for example, with some [[Aikido]] [[martialist]]s. [[Morihei Ueshiba]] was known to practice cold water [[misogi]].
* Kamakura, Japan has a temple whose [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren Buddhist]] priests in training practice a ritual of 100 days of fasting, meditation and walking which ends with stripping to loincloths and dousing with ice cold water.

=== Russia ===
Jumping in freezing lakes, [[ice swimming]], is an old Russian tradition that goes hand in hand with going to [[Banya (sauna)|banya]], a sauna-like bath. Some douse with a bucket of cold water. The bucket is filled with water and left out overnight. They then walk with it outside and spill it over themselves. Preferences include being barefoot outside on the earth, and performing dousing at certain times and more frequently when ill.

For some, dousing accompanies [[fasting]] (absence of all food and water) as an alternate means for the body to obtain water.

Some follow cold water dousing with air-drying outside or in wintertime taking a "snow bath" by rubbing handfuls of snow on the body or lying/moving in it.

* [[Porfiry Ivanov]]'s health system includes cold water dousing.
* Cold water dousing is practiced by some [[Systema]] martialists.

=== Thailand ===
[[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]] is a popular festival in April which includes dousing using water. It is also celebrated by the [[Dai people]] in [[Yunnan]] Province in [[China]], and in [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Myanmar]] during the traditional New Year.

[[File:Chang Chun Shrine amk.jpg|thumb|Eternal Spring Shrine]]

'''Eternal Spring Shrine''', also called '''Changchun Shrine''' ({{zh|t=長春祠|p=Chángchūn cí|poj=Tiông-chhun-sû|l=Ancestral shrine of Eternal, or Long, Spring}}), is a landmark and a memorial shrine complex in [[Taroko National Park]] in [[Taiwan]], in [[Hualian County]] near town of [[Xiulin]]. It is one of the major picturesque points of the park, with the view of the mountains and the waterfall, and one of the main memorials for veterans. 

[[Image:Taiwan 2009 HuaLien Taroko Gorge FRD 5435 Pano Extracted.jpg|thumb|View of Eternal Spring Shrine from the [[Central Cross-Island Highway]]]]

It was planned for construction in 1958 while the [[Central Cross-Island Highway]] was built nearby. It commemorates the memory of 212 veterans who died while constructing the highway (1956—1960). 

The name of the temple comes from the [[Changchun Falls]] that never stop running.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taroko.gov.tw/English/?mm=5&amp;sm=1&amp;page=7 Taroko National Park - Changchun Shrine] at the official web site of the Park&lt;/ref&gt; The Shrine is located right above the waterfall streams.

It has been rebuilt at least twice, after being destroyed by [[landslides]]. The most recent shrine was built in 1989.

The '''''Grimorium Verum''''' (Latin for '''''True Grimoire''''') is an 18th-century [[grimoire]] attributed to one "Alibeck the Egyptian" of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], who purportedly wrote in 1517. Like many grimoires, it claims a tradition originating with [[Solomon|King Solomon]].

The grimoire is not a translation of an earlier work as purported, its original appearing in French or Italian in the mid-18th century, as noted already by [[A. E. Waite]] who discussed the work in his ''[[The Book of Ceremonial Magic]]'' (1911), stating:

{{quote|The date specified in the title of the ''Grimorium Verum'' is undeniably fraudulent; the work belongs to the middle of the eighteenth century, and Memphis is Rome.}}

One version of the ''Grimoire'' was included as ''The Clavicles of King Solomon: Book 3'' in one of the French manuscripts [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers|S. L. MacGregor Mathers]] incorporated in his version of the ''[[Key of Solomon]]'', but it was omitted from the ''Key'' with the following explanation:&lt;ref&gt;Joseph H Peterson, ''Grimorium Verum'', {{ISBN|978-1-4348-1116-5}}, Appendix 1, "Excerpts from Grimorium Verum from British Library manuscript Lansdowne 1202", pp.&amp;nbsp;79.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|At the end there are some short extracts from the ''Grimorium Verum'' with the Seals of evil spirits, which, as they do not belong to the ''Key of Solomon'' proper, I have not given. For the evident classification of the ''Key'' is in two books and no more.}}

[[Idries Shah]] also published some of it in ''The Secret Lore of Magic: Book of the Sorcerers'' in 1957.

'''Hinduism''' has been spread in [[Russia]] primarily due to the work of missionaries from the religious organization [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON) and by itinerant [[Swami|Swamis]] from [[India]] and small communities of Indian immigrants. While ISKCON and Brahma Kumari appear to have a relatively strong following in Russia, the other organizations in the list have a marginal presence in this country. There is an active [[Tantra]] [[Sangha]] operating in Russia. According to a 2010 religious census, there are 140,000 Hindus in Russia, which account for 0.1% population of Russia.&lt;ref name="Are naAtlas"&gt;[http://sreda.org/en/arena Arena - Atlas of Religions and Nationalities in Russia].

Slavic Vedism involves the use of Vedic rituals and worship of ancient Vedic deities, distinguishing from other groups which have maintained a stronger bond with modern [[Hinduism in India|Indian Hinduism]], although [[Krishnaism|Krishnaite]] groups often identify themselves as "Vedic" too.

==Controversies==
[[File:Russian Hare Krishna book distributor.jpg|thumb|[[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] devotee with books.]]
===Building of a Hindu temple in Moscow===
The Russian government is consistently opposing the building of a Krishna temple in Russia. A temporary temple was made in 2003, which the authorities asked devotees to vacate their temple in exchange for a piece of land on which they could build a bigger temple.&lt;ref name="pl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pluralism.org/news/article.php?id=11919|title=RDN Article: Hindu Organizations Launch "Defend Russian Hindus" Website (Russia, International)|publisher=www.pluralism.org|accessdate=2008-11-01}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in November 2005, the [[Mayor of Moscow]] canceled the land order and took away the piece of land given for the construction of the Hindu temple.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} When the Hindu temple situated near the [[Begovaya (Moscow Metro)|Begovaya metro station]] (in the centre of Moscow) was demolished in 2004, the Moscow government allotted land for construction of a new temple at the Leningradsky Prospekt (north of Moscow). This land was subsequently taken away.&lt;ref name="in.rbth.com"&gt;http://in.rbth.com/news/2013/07/30/moscow_may_lose_its_sole_hare_krishna_temple_27771.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Moscow government promised to build a temple in the Molzhaninovo district (10&amp;nbsp;km from the Moscow ring road) as part of the joint declaration signed by the Moscow and New Delhi governments. A Russian Orthodox Church has since been built in Delhi.&lt;ref name="in.rbth.com" /&gt; On January 14, 2006, [[Mayor of London]] [[Ken Livingstone]] handed over letters expressing concern about the  harassment of Russian Hindus by the Moscow government and the Russian Orthodox Church to the visiting Mayor of Moscow [[Yuri Luzhkov]] in [[London]],{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} even as [[British Parliament]]arians led by MP Ashok Kumar Das got ready to host the launch of the Defend Russian Hindus campaign at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 18 January of the same year. Later [[Shiela Dixit]], the Chief Minister of Delhi, prominently raised the issue during her visit to Moscow. Many intellectuals have expressed concerns at the discrimination being committed by Russians given the tolerance to Christians in India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/krishna-yet-to-win-russian-hearts/article5151000.ece&lt;/ref&gt; A joint statement was passed by Indian parliament which denounced the persecution of Russian Hindus. "Our temple is the only place to fulfil not only the religious, but also the cultural and social needs of Indians, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Mauritians and Nepalese", Priya Das, an ISKCON representative said. "This also helps their children to keep in touch with their culture and religion."

===Demolition of Divya Loka monastery in Nizhny Novgorod===
In August 2016 the Divya Loka monastery, a Vedic Hindu monastery founded in 2001 in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], was destroyed for unclear reasons and many other religious institutions face the same threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cit web|last1=Sibireva|first1=Olga|last2=Verkhovsky|first2=Alexander|url=http://www.sova-center.ru/en/religion/publications/2017/05/d36996/|title=Freedom of Conscience in Russia: Restrictions and Challenges in 2016|publisher=SOVA - Center for Information and Analysis|date=10 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115150826/http://www.sova-center.ru/en/religion/publications/2017/05/d36996/|archive-date=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-cult activists against Hinduism===
It has been reported that the well-known anti-cult activist [[Alexander Dvorkin]] has been driving a campaign against Hinduism in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shri Prakash Dham|url=http://businesswireindia.com/news/fulldetails/russian-mp-supports-hindus-russia-against-alexander-dworkin/52516|title=Russian MP Supports Hindus in Russia against Alexander Dworkin|website=Business Wire India|date=6 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309090633/http://businesswireindia.com/news/fulldetails/russian-mp-supports-hindus-russia-against-alexander-dworkin/52516|archive-date=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Banning of Yoga===
Many places in Russia bans yoga claiming it as an evil religious cult that may cultivate the notion of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bookyogaretreats.com/news/yoga-ban&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials in Central Russia Have Banned Yoga claiming that it's too much like a religious cult.In 2015, two studios in the central city of Nizhnevartovsk named The Aura and Ingara studios have reportedly been sent letters by local authorities asking them to stop hosting yoga classes being taught in municipal buildings.Both studios conduct classes of Hatha yoga.Hindu tradition believes that [[Hatha yoga]] was founded by Shiva, one of the main deities of Hinduism&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-bans-yoga-as-part-of-crackdown-on-religious-cults-10355676.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://time.com/3942725/russian-yoga-ban-religious-cults-nizhnevartovsk/&lt;/ref&gt;.In 2017, a yoga teacher in St Petersburg, Russia has been charged with illegal missionary activity under a controversial new law designed to fight terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/12/russian-yoga-fans-alarmed-at-arrest-of-teacher-under-new-law&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iranian religions''' are [[religion]]s which originated in [[Greater Iran]].

==Background==
The beliefs, activities, and cultural events of the ancient [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]] in [[ancient Iran]] are complex matters. The ancient Iranians made references to a combination of several [[Aryan race|Aryans]] and non-Aryan tribes. Aryans, or ancient Iranians, worshiped natural elements such as the sun, sunlight and thunder, but they eventually shifted their attention mostly to a single god, whilst acknowledging others. The Iranian ancient prophet, [[Zoroaster]], reformed Iranian religious beliefs to a form of [[Henotheism]]. The [[Gathas]], hymns of Zoroaster's [[Avesta]], brought monotheistic ideas to [[Persia]], while through the [[Yashts]] and [[Yasna]], mentions are made to [[Polytheism]] and earlier creeds. The [[Vedas]] and the Avesta have both served researchers as important resources in discovering early Aryan beliefs and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Jahangir Oshidri (1997), ''Mazdisna encyclopedia '', Markaz Publishers , 1st publish.{{ISBN|964-305-307-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity==
*[[proto-Indo-Iranian religion]]:&lt;ref&gt;Relating Religion: Essays in the Study of Religion
 by Jonathan Z. Smith&lt;/ref&gt; The various beliefs and practices from which the later indigenous religion of the Iranian peoples evolved. This religion also influenced the development of the [[Indian religions]]. 
* [[ancient Iranian religion]]: The ancient religion of the Iranian peoples
* [[Zoroastrianism]]: The present-day umbrella term for the indigenous native beliefs and practices of the Iranian peoples. While present-day Zoroastrianism is monolithic, a continuation of the [[elite religion|elite form]] of the [[Sasanian Empire]], in antiquity it had several variants or denominations, differing slightly by location, ethnic affiliation and historical period. It once had large population and high diversity.
* [[Zurvanism]]: By the late [[Achaemenid Empire]], Zoroastrianism was also evident as Zurvanism (Zurvanite Zoroastrianism), a [[monism|monist]] [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] that had a following as late as the Sasanian Empire.
* [[Mithraism]]: A mystery religion centred around the proto-Zoroastrian Persian god Mithras that was practised in the Roman Empire from about the 1st to the fourth century CE
* [[Manichaeism]]: third century [[Dualistic cosmology|ditheistic]] gnosticism that may have been influenced by Mandaeism. Manichaens believed in a "Father of Greatness" (Aramaic: ''Abbā dəRabbūṯā'', Persian: ''pīd ī wuzurgīh'') and observed Him to be the highest deity (of light). 
* [[Mazdak]]ism: A late fifth/early sixth century proto-[[socialist]] gnosticism that sought to do away with [[private property]].

==Medieval period==
Some religionists made syncretic teachings of [[Islam]] and local [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/article/603447 The Nativist Prophets of Early Islamic Iran: Rural Revolt and Local Zoroastrianism by Patricia Crone (review)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The early Islamic period saw the development of [[Persian mysticism]], a traditional interpretation of existence, life and love with Perso-Islamic [[Sufism|Sufi]] monotheism as its practical aspect. This development believed in a direct perception of spiritual truth (God), through mystic practices based on divine love.
* [[Khurramites]], a 9th-century religious and political movement based on the 8th century teachings of [[Sunpadh]], who preached a syncretism of Shia Islam and Zoroastrianism. Under [[Babak Khorramdin]], the movement sought the redistribution of private wealth and the abolition of Islam.
* [[Behafarid]]ians, an 8th-century cult movement around the prophet [[Behafarid]]. Although the movement is considered to have its roots in Zoroastrianism, Behafarid and his followers were executed on charges (made by Zoroastrians) of harm to both Zoroastrianism and Islam.
* [[Yarsan]], a religious order of [[Yazdanism]], which is believed to have been founded in the 16th century. Yazdanism promulgated the belief in a God manifest as one primary and five secondary avatars to form with God the Holy Seven.

==Modern==
* [[Uatsdin]], revival of [[Ossetians|Ossetian]] [[ethnic religion]] (see: [[Ossetian mythology]])
* Roshanniya Movement, a set of monotheistic teachings of [[Pir Roshan]] which his people followed.
* [[Bábism]], a mid-19th century monotheistic religion founded by the [[Báb]] that was a predecessor of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. 
* [[Bahá'í Faith]], an emerging monotheistic religion founded by [[Bahá'u'lláh]], a 19th-century Persian exile.

The '''Jewish Conservative Party''' ({{lang-cs|Židovská konzervativní strana}}) was a political party of the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]]. It was created in August 1921 as a regional [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] splinter party from the [[Jewish Party (Czechoslovakia)|Jewish Party]] by Markus Ungar, who was the top candidate of the [[Jewish Economic Party]] in Carpathian Ruthenia for the [[Czechoslovak parliamentary election, 1925 |1925 Czechoslovak parliamentary elections]].

The '''Jewish Socialist Federation''' (JSF) was a [[secular]] [[Jewish]] [[Yiddish]]-oriented organization founded in 1912 which acted as a [[language federation]] in the [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA). Many of the founding members of the JSF had previously been members of the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] in Eastern Europe and sought to bring [[Bundist]] politics to the socialist movement in the USA. 

The JSF split in 1921 over the question of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], with the organization disaffiliating from the SPA and a minority splitting to form a new organization called the [[Jewish Socialist Verband]] (JSV) and remaining affiliated to the SPA. The newly independent JSF soon joined the [[Workers Party of America]] (legal arm of the underground [[Communist Party of America]]) and merged into a previously-existing Jewish Communist Federation of that organization.

==History==
===Background===

Scholars have commonly dated the origin of the [[Jews|Jewish]] [[organized labor|labor movement]] in the United States to the decade of the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Tony Michels, ''A Fire in Their Hearts: Yiddish Socialists in New York.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2005, pp. 30-41; Melech Epstein, ''Jewish Labor in the USA: An Industrial, Political, and Cultural History of the Jewish Labor Movement: Volume 1, 1882-1914.'' New York: Trade Union Sponsoring Committee, 1950, ''passim;'' Gerald Sorin, ''The Prophetic Minority: American Jewish Immigrant Radicals, 1880-1920.'' Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1985, ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

There were quantitative reasons for this date of origin. Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] was assassinated by a bomb on March 13, 1881, and ushered in a wave of official and popular [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] violence known as [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|pogroms]] in which individuals were killed, cultural institutions sacked, and property destroyed. The reaction raged at its most extreme in the years 1881 and 1882, during which there were scores of violent events throughout the southern and western [[Pale of Settlement|regions of the Russian empire in which Jews were permitted to dwell]].&lt;ref&gt;For a monograph on the 1881-1882 terror, see Stephen M. Berk, ''Year of Crisis, Year of Hope: Russian Jewry and the Pogroms of 1881-1882.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; A wave of emigration followed, with the number of Jewish immigrants to the United States rocketing from less than 35,000 for the entire decade of the 1870s to more than 175,000 during the decade of the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Melech Epstein, ''Jewish Labor in the USA: An Industrial, Political, and Cultural History of the Jewish Labor Movement: Volume 1, 1882-1914.'' New York: Trade Union Sponsoring Committee, 1950; pp. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish emigration, particularly from the violent and anti-semitic Russian empire continued to accelerate during the decade of the 1890s, with more than one out of every ten new arrivals in the United States of Jewish ethnicity during those years.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, ''Jewish Labor in the USA,'' vol. 1, pg. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antecedents===

Early Jewish Socialist political organization in the United States kept its eyes and agenda focused abroad, as American affiliates of the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|General Jewish Labor Bund]], a revolutionary organization seeking the overthrow of tsarism in the Russian empire. The first such American branch of the Bund was formed in 1900 and within five years about 50 such American Bund affiliates were formed, united under the umbrella of a group called the Central Union of Bund Organizations.&lt;ref name=Levin166&gt;Nora Levin, ''While Messiah Tarried: Jewish Socialist Movements, 1871-1917.'' New York: Schocken Books, 1977; pg. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their Eastern European focus, centered around the raising and transmission of funds to the Russian revolutionary movement, these American Bund groups advocated Jewish cultural and political autonomy rather than assimilation into the domestic orientation of the anglophonic [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA).&lt;ref name=Levin166 /&gt;

From 1905 many local Yiddish-language organization were loosely coordinated by a group called the Jewish Socialist Agitation Bureau, founded by a tailor from [[Rochester, New York]] named Max Kaufman.&lt;ref name=Michels158&gt;Michels, ''A Fire in Their Hearts,'' pg. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufman's Agitation Bureau was envisioned as a mechanism for bringing prominent Yiddish-language socialists from New York City to address Jewish communities in Rochester, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and elsewhere in the Northeast.&lt;ref name=Michels158 /&gt; This effort proved successful, with such socialist notables as economist [[Isaac Hourwich]] and politician [[Meyer London]] sponsored on speaking tours.&lt;ref name=Michels158 /&gt; The Bureau also coordinated the distribution of leaflets and pamphlets in the Yiddish language.&lt;ref name=Davenport&gt;Tim Davenport, [http://www.marxisthistory.org/subject/usa/eam/lfedjewish.html "Jewish (Yiddish) Language Federations,"] Early American Marxism website, www.marxisthistory.org/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Socialist Agitation Bureau met in convention annually,&lt;ref&gt;Michels, ''A Fire in Their Hearts,'' pg. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; with the established network of Bundist clubs playing a key role in the organization's expansion. By 1909 it was estimated that between 80 and 90 percent of the affiliates of the Bureau maintained Bundist ties.&lt;ref&gt;Michels, ''A Fire in Their Hearts,'' pg. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Establishment of the JSF===

The American urban [[working class]] was largely an immigrant population in the early years of the 20th century and the Socialist Party of America sought to improve its connection with non-English-speaking workers through the expansion of its [[language federation]]s — semi-autonomous parallel organizations coordinating the activity of party branches speaking a common language and expediting the distribution of pamphlets and leaflets in that tongue.

In contrast to the dozens of independent Finnish-language socialist clubs which joined en bloc to establish the [[Finnish Socialist Federation]] of the SPA in 1906, the Jewish Socialist Federation was created largely through the initiative of the Socialist Party itself.  Socialist Party branches conducting their business in Yiddish existed as regular units of the state and national Socialist Party, paying full dues to those party organizations and differing from English-language branches only in the language in which they conducted their business.&lt;ref name=Davenport /&gt;

As early as 1907, Jewish Socialist Agitation Bureau founder Max Kaufman proposed the establishment of a Yiddish language federation within the Socialist Party — although this proposal was initially shot down by doctrinaire Jewish socialists as an unacceptable compromise with [[Zionism|ethnic nationalism]] rather than class-based internationalism.&lt;ref name=Michels158 /&gt; One prominent Jewish socialist was quick to dismiss the idea of a semi-autonomous Jewish federation paralleling the Bund with the assertion that "in America special Russian Jewish wounds do not exist; thus, here in America there can be no place and no value for special Russian Jewish remedies."&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Zametkin, in ''Tsayt-Gayst'' (The Spirit of the Times), Jan. 18, 1907, pg. 8. Quoted in Michels, ''A Fire in Their Hearts,'' pg. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, sentiment seeking organization of Yiddish-language Socialist branches continued to develop. 

A major step towards language autonomy was taken in the summer of 1910 when the SPA's constitution was amended to entitle any non-English language group with 500 or more dues paying members to federation status with a paid official called a "Translator-Secretary" granted an office at party headquarters in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name=Levin198&gt;Levin, ''While Messiah Tarried,'' pg. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two years SPA Federations had been launched for the party's [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Scandinavia|Swedish/Norwegian]], and [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] members, joined in 1912 with the formation of the Yiddish-language Jewish Socialist Federation.&lt;ref name=Levin198 /&gt;

Many or most ethnic Jews in the SPA were not members of the Jewish Socialist Federation, instead participating in English-language branches.&lt;ref name=Sorin104&gt;Gerald Sorin, ''The Prophetic Minority: American Jewish Immigrant Radicals, 1880-1920.'' Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1985; pg. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, some of these disapproved of the Jewish Federation, preferring promotion of the process of "Americanization" and integration into American political life over the semi-autonomous federation approach — which was characterized by activist and historian [[Will Herberg]] as "virtually a Jewish Socialist Party within the...Party."&lt;ref name=Herberg&gt;Will Herberg, "The American Jewish Labor Movement," in ''American Jewish Year Books, vol. 80 (1952), pg. 25; cited in Sorin, ''The Prophetic Minority,'' pg. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; While tactically useful in coordinating socialist propaganda in the native language of immigrant workers, the implicit emphasis of ethnicity over social class of the federation approach seemed to many a departure from the traditional socialist principle of internationalism.&lt;ref name=Sorin104 /&gt;

===Development===

The Jewish Socialist Federation grew rapidly, soon numbering some 65 geographic branches with a membership approaching 3,000.&lt;ref name=Sorin104 /&gt; Despite the ethnic rather than class orientation behind its organization, the Jewish Federation attracted some of the most radical Jewish socialists to its ranks, soon emerging to the left of the Socialist Party itself.&lt;ref name=Herberg /&gt;

'''''Kecak''''' (pronounced {{IPA-may|ˈketʃaʔ|}} ("Kechak"), alternate spellings: '''''Kechak''''' and '''''Ketjak'''''), known in [[Bahasa Indonesia|Indonesian]] as ''Tari Kecak'', is a form of [[Balinese dance|Balinese hindu dance]] and [[music drama]] that was developed in the 1930s in [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]]. Since its creation it has been performed primarily by men, with the very first women's kecak group starting in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2006/12/03/cultural-liberty-under-spotlight-women-playwrights.html "Cultural Liberty Under Spotlight at Women Playwrights"], ''Jakarta Post'', 3 December 2006, accessed 13 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The dance mainly plays about the [[Ramayana]] and is traditionally performed in [[Balinese temple|temples]] and villages across [[Bali]]. 

Also known as the '''Ramayana Monkey Chant''', the piece, performed by a circle of at least 150 performers wearing checked cloth around their waists, percussively chanting "''chak''" and moving their hands and arms, depicts a battle from the [[Ramayana]]. The [[monkey]]-like [[Vanara]] led by [[Hanuman]] helped Prince [[Rama]] fight the evil King [[Ravana]]. ''Kecak'' has roots in ''[[sanghyang]],'' a trance-inducing [[exorcism]] dance.&lt;ref name="Picard"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Michel Picard | title = 'Cultural Tourism' in Bali: Cultural Performances as Tourist Attraction, ''Indonesia'' | edition = Vol. 49 | date = April 1990 | page = 37–74 | publisher = Southeast Asia Program Publications, Cornell University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Kecak.JPG|left|thumb|250px|A ''kecak'' dance being performed at [[Uluwatu]], in Bali]]
''Kecak'' was originally a [[trance]] ritual accompanied by male [[choir|chorus]]. In the 1930s, [[Walter Spies]], a [[German people|German]] painter and musician, became deeply interested in the ritual while living in [[Bali]]. He adapted it as a drama, based on the Hindu ''[[Ramayana]]'' and including dance, intended for performance before Western tourist audiences.

This is an example of what [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] describes as part of the "modern art-culture system"&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]], ''The Predicament of Culture: Twentieth-Century Ethnography, Literature, and Art'' (Cambridge and London: [[Harvard University Press]], 1988), p. 223. Cited in Yamashita (1999), p.178.&lt;/ref&gt; in which, "the West or the central power adopts, transforms, and consumes non-Western or peripheral cultural elements, while making 'art,' which was once embedded in the culture as a whole, into a separate entity."&lt;ref&gt;Shinji Yamashita. "Review: Michel Picard, ''Bali: Cultural Tourism and Touristic Culture''", ''Indonesia'', Vol. 67, (Apr., 1999), pp. 177–182. Southeast Asia Program Publications, Cornell University.&lt;/ref&gt; Spies worked with [[Wayan Limbak]], who popularized the dance by arranging for performances by Balinese groups touring internationally. These tours have helped make the ''kecak'' internationally known.

[[Image:Kecak Kanisius.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A ''kecak'' dance being performed at [[Kolese Kanisius]], [[Jakarta]]]]

[[I Wayan Dibia]], a performer, choreographer, and scholar, suggests, by contrast, that the Balinese were already developing this form when Spies arrived on the island.&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;David W. Hughes, "Review: ''Kecak: The Vocal Chant of Bali,'' by I Wayan Dibia", ''British Journal of Ethnomusicology,'' Vol. 6, (1997), pp. 195–195. British Forum for Ethnomusicology.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during the 1920s, the well-known dancer [[I Limbak]] had incorporated ''[[Baris (dance)|Baris]]'' movements into the ''cak'' leader role. "Spies liked this innovation," and he suggested that Limbak "devise a spectacle based on the ''Ramayana''," accompanied by ''cak'' chorus rather than [[gamelan]], as would have been usual.&lt;ref name="Picard"/&gt;

==Performance== 
[[File:Sita captive.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kecak dancers chant facing the figure playing as [[Ravana]]]]
The Kecak dance is likely to be consists of about fifty to one hundred men wearing only loin-cloth, the upper part of their bodies are left bare. They form rows of circles, in the middle of which is a traditional Balinese coconut oil lamp. First they move their bodies rhythmically to the left and to the right, chanting the words "''chak ke-chak ke-chak ke-chak''" continuously, in slow rhythm. Gradually the rhythm is speeded up and by turns they lift their hands, trembling, into the air. The kecak dance is performed for dance-dramas and the story presented is taken from the [[Ramayana]] Hindu epic. The kecak dance is used to present the Ramayana dance-drama, the bare-chested male Kecak chanters play as [[Rama]]'s troops of [[Vanaras]] (apes) and also as [[Ravana]]'s troops of [[Rakshasa]]s (giants). 

The duration of the performance is usually one hour and it depicts the story of the Ramayana from the point of Sita and Rama during their exile in the jungle of [[Dandaka]]. It then is followed by the appearance of the Golden Deer, the abduction of [[Sita]] by [[Ravana]], the battle between [[Ravana]] and [[Jatayu]], the search for Sita by [[Hanuman]], and is ended by the battle between [[Rama]] and [[Ravana]]. The Kecak chanters in this stage chant and sing accordingly to the mood and milieu of the story taking part.

Kecak dance performances in [[Bali]] usually take part daily in the evening (6 pm) at [[Balinese temple|Balinese hindu temples]] such as in [[Uluwatu Temple]] and [[Tanah Lot]]. There are also Dance stages meant only for the Kecak performance such as in [[Ubud]], [[Garuda Wisnu Kencana]], [[Batu Bulan]], [[Pandawa beach]] and other places in Bali. The kecak performance is also conducted in other occasions, usually for cultural and entertainment display. Dancers performing usually come from local villagers of the surrounding area of the performance. The dancers usually have a main job other than performing the Kecak dance, they dance usually after finishing their main job. The dancers income from the dance usually comes from the ticket sold to the spectators of the Kecak dance. The most popular destination for the Kechak dance performance takes place at [[Uluwatu Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGIlkmQX-g0&lt;/ref&gt;  

The dance is then usually concluded after the depiction of the battle between Rama and Ravana or after the burning of Hanuman by Ravana's servants like the one performed in [[Uluwatu Temple]], then Hanuman brings Sita to Rama. After the performance, spectators are usually invited to take a picture with the dancers.

===Dancers===
The dancers consists of two types in the Kecak dance, which are the Kecak male-chanters and the main Ramayana dancers who play as Sita, Rama, [[Lakshmana]], Ravana, Hanuman, Jatayu, etc. The Kecak male-chanters who chant ''chak-chak-chak'' some have their own tasks during the performance. One individual is tasked for maintaining the beat of the chant with the chanting of "''po-po-po''", it is usually done by a single man. The other task is done by a man who become the leader of the chorus, he is tasked for instructing the chorus to stop or to start the chanting by yelling command vocals such as "''Diih!''", "''Chiaaat!''", etc. After that, there is the man who is tasked for singing during the chanting, he sings with a melodious and rhythmical tone according to the situation of the dance such as "''Shiiir-yang-ngger-yang-nggur-yang-nggeer''" and other melodies. Then, there is another man who become as the ''Dalang'' who is tasked to narrate [[Ramayana|the story]] during the dance usually in [[Balinese language]] and [[Sanskrit]], he plays as the narrator of the performance. Men chosen for these tasks are usually the senior male dancers. The remaining chanters chant "''chak-chak-chak''" continuously and simultaneously. 

The dancers who play as the core Ramayana figures are also considered to be an essential part of the dance. Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, and the Golden Deer is sometimes played by female in this situation because the movements is needed to be soft and smooth which is only trained for women not for men, men rather play as muscular figures such as [[Ravan]], [[Hanuman]], [[Sugriv]], etc.

===Trance===
Trance rituals is usually accompanied in the Kecak dance during certain phases. Such as during the act of the burning of Hanuman which is followed by the Fire kicking known as the Fire dance is accompanied by a Trance phase by the dancer of Hanuman where he is blessed by the priest before the act. The dancer during that phase does not feel any pain from the fire because is in the stage of Trance.

{{merge to|Textual variants in the New Testament|discuss=Talk:Textual variants in the New Testament#Merger Discussion|date=April 2017}}

This is an (incomplete) list of major textual variants in the [[New Testament]], with a focus on differences between [[Categories of New Testament manuscripts|categories of New Testament manuscript]].

* The [[Textus Receptus]] ([[Latin]]: "received text") is the name subsequently given to the succession of printed [[Greek language|Greek]] texts of the [[New Testament]] which was first collated by [[Desiderius Erasmus]] in the 16th century. It constituted the translation base for the translation of the New Testament into [[English language|English]] by [[William Tyndale]], the [[King James Version]], and most other [[Protestant reformation|Reformation-era]] New Testament translations throughout Western and [[Central Europe]].
* The Majority Text represents the [[Byzantine text-type]], which was used in Eastern Greek speaking churches and was dominant from the late [[middle ages]] onwards. It is similar to the Textus Receptus.
* The modern [[textual criticism|critical text]] (e.g. [[Novum Testamentum Graece]]) is close to the [[Alexandrian text-type]], which accounts for some of the earliest New Testament manuscripts; it stands behind most modern English translations of the New Testament including the [[American Standard Version]], [[New International Version]], [[Revised Standard Version]], [[New Revised Standard Version]], [[New American Standard Bible]], [[Jerusalem Bible]], [[New American Bible]], [[English Standard Version]], and others.

For a more comprehensive list which includes many minor variants, see [[Textual variants in the New Testament]].

== Variations between Majority Text/Textus Receptus and critical text ==
The following list contains texts where the Majority Text is in agreement with the Textus Receptus, against the critical text.

MT = Majority Text. (English text from [[New King James Version]] )  CT = Critical text (English text from [[New American Standard Bible]] )

=== Gospels ===

'''Luang Por Dattajivo''' ({{lang-th|ทตฺตชีโว}}, {{rtgs|''Thattachiwo''}}; {{lang-pi|Dattajīvo}}; born 21 December 1940&lt;ref name="Pim 2012" /&gt;), also known by his birth name '''Phadet Phongsawat''' ({{lang-th|เผด็จ ผ่องสวัสดิ์}}) and former [[ecclesiastical peerage of Thailand|ecclesiastical title]] '''Phrarajbhavanajahn''' ({{lang-th|พระราชภาวนาจารย์}}, {{rtgs|''Phra Rat Phawanachan''}}), is a Thai Buddhist monk. He is the former deputy-abbot of [[Wat Phra Dhammakaya]] and the vice-president of the Dhammakaya Foundation, and has been the observing abbot of the temple from 1999 until 2006, and again from 2011 until 2016. {{As of|2016|12|post=,}} he was still widely considered the de facto abbot. He met ''[[Mae chi]]'' (nun) [[Chandra Khonnokyoong]] and [[Luang Por Dhammajayo]] in his student years, and they have been his teachers throughout his life.

[[Luang Por]] Dattajivo was ordained in 1971, and quickly became a prolific author. He also took on a significant role in managing Wat Phra Dhammakaya. It was for this position that he was charged by the Thai military junta in 2017, when he refused to deliver Luang Por Dhammajayo to the authorities. This happened during the [[History of Wat Phra Dhammakaya#Junta's lockdown|lockdown by the Thai junta]], when abbot Luang Por Dhammajayo was sought for charges of receiving ill-gotten gains, charges which have been widely described as politically motivated.&lt;ref name="BBC 2017"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39263793 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180606113806/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39263793 |archive-date=6 June 2018 |dead-url=no |title=The curious case of a hidden abbot and a besieged temple|last=Head|first=Jonathan|date=22 March 2017|work=[[BBC]]|location=Bangkok|access-date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phadet became involved in Thai [[Magic (paranormal)|black magic]] at the age of seventeen.&lt;ref name="Pim 2012"&gt;{{cite news|work=Pim Thai|date=14 December 2012|page=7|script-title=วันคล้ายวันเกิดหลวงพ่อทัตตะ|language=th|trans-title=Luang Por Datta's birthday}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackenzie 2007"&gt;{{Citation|last=Mackenzie|first=Rory|title=New Buddhist Movements in Thailand: Towards an understanding of Wat Phra Dhammakaya and Santi Asoke|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/New%20Buddhist%20Movements%20In%20Thailand_Mackenzie.pdf|year=2007|location=Abingdon|publisher=[[Routledge]]|ISBN=0-203-96646-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his student years at [[Kasetsart University]], he would often hold organized public demonstrations of black magic for his fellow students. In the biographies of [[Wat Phra Dhammakaya]] it is described that every time a junior student, Chaiyabun (who later became known as Luang Por Dhammajayo), came to watch one of Phadet's demonstrations, the magic would not work. Phadet therefore become curious about Chaiyabun's mental powers, and decided to test Chaiyabun by bringing him to his black magic teacher. But even the teacher could not use his powers in Chaiyabun's presence. Phadet therefore wanted to learn more about Chaiyabun and the [[Dhammakaya meditation|meditation he practiced]]. He felt inspired by Chaiyabun's sincerity in meditation and his adherence to the Buddhist [[five precepts]].&lt;ref name="Mackenzie 2007" /&gt;{{rp|83}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=พระทัตตชีโว หลังฉากพระธัมมชโย|trans-title=Phra Dattajivo, the man standing behind Phra Dhammajayo|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxOR950PgTk|accessdate=20 November 2016|work=Amarin|date=1 June 2016|language=th|time=1:38}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a turning point in his life, and from that moment on he has always been Chaiyabun's student and assistant,&lt;ref name="Mackenzie 2007" /&gt;{{rp|41}}&lt;ref name="Apinya 1998"&gt;{{cite thesis|url=http://www.cubs.chula.ac.th/images/research/58_2/Dhammakaya_Full.pdf|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6zyKHUyJw?url=http://www.cubs.chula.ac.th/images/research/58_2/Dhammakaya_Full.pdf|archive-date=2018-06-06|dead-url=no|last1=Fuengfusakul|first1=Apinya|script-title=ศาสนาทัศน์ของชุมชนเมืองสมัยใหม่: ศึกษากรณีวัดพระธรรมกาย|trans-title=Religious Propensity of Urban Communities: A Case Study of Phra Dhammakaya Temple|publisher=Buddhist Studies Center, [[Chulalongkorn University]]|year=1998|type=published Ph.D.|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2017-03-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}} and they developed a solid friendship.&lt;ref name="Litalien 2010" /&gt; Phadet gave up the practice of black magic and through Chaiyabun met Mae Chi Chandra.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kom 2017"&gt;{{cite news|script-title=เด็ดปีกสายเหยี่ยวพระเผด็จ ดอนแห่งธรรมกาย|url=http://www.komchadluek.net/news/scoop/263809 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180606114258/http://www.komchadluek.net/news/scoop/263809 |archive-date=6 June 2018 |dead-url=no |accessdate=11 March 2017|work=[[Kom Chad Luek]]|publisher=[[The Nation Group]]|date=9 March 2017|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt; He trained in meditation with Mae Chi Chandra for years.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1835-9310.1989.tb00100.x/full|last1=Taylor|first1=J.

In 1971, Phadet was ordained and became known as Luang Por Dattajivo, which means "He who gives his soul [to Buddhism]".&lt;ref name="TNA 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Now 2016"&gt;{{cite news|script-title=หลวงพ่อทัตตชีโว ผู้สืบทอดอาณาจักรธรรมกาย|trans-title=Luang por Dattajivo, the person who continues the Dhammakaya kingdom|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVRYPpQs4CA|accessdate=20 November 2016|work=NOW 26|date=30 May 2016|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Rhys Davids|first1=Thomas W.|author1-link=T.W.

Furthermore, he helped develop the friendly relationships with the people living in the neighborhood of the temple, and was responsible for receiving guests at the temple.&lt;ref name="Kom 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TNA 2017"&gt;{{cite news|date=23 February 2017|work=[[Thailand News Agency]]|publisher=[[MCOT]]|url=http://www.tnamcot.com/news_resource/%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%84%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B3-%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A8-%E0%B8%8A%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B5-2391|script-title=ข่าวค่ำ (ในประเทศ) ช่วงที่ 2|trans-title=Evening news (national), part 2|language=th|time=16:44|title=Archived copy|access-date=2017-03-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312083036/http://www.tnamcot.com/news_resource/%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%84%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B3-%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A8-%E0%B8%8A%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B5-2391|archive-date=2017-03-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teacher, Luang por Dattajivo has spoken regularly before international audiences.

In Wat Phra Dhammakaya, he is the person with the second most authority in the temple, next to Luang Por Dhammajayo.

[[File:Luang Por Dattajivo sitting.jpg|alt=Luang Por Dattajivo sitting|thumb|Luang Por Dattajivo in 2012]]
In 2016, under the [[National Council for Peace and Order|military junta]], Luang Por Dhammajayo was charged with conspiring in money-laundering and receiving ill-gotten gains from the chairman of a [[credit union]]. Wat Phra Dhammakaya denied the charges and stated they were politically motivated. When Luang Por Dhammajayo did not go and acknowledge the charges, [[Wat Phra Dhammakaya#Junta's lockdown|the temple was sealed off in a lockdown]]. As the authorities were unable to find Luang Por Dhammajayo, they asked Luang Por Dattajivo to hand over Luang Por Dhammajayo. However, the temple released a press statement that they did not trust the authorities, and Luang Por Dattajivo did not show up for any negotiations. He was then charged for obstructing the authorities.&lt;ref name="TNA 2017" /&gt;

The charges laid against the temple and its abbot have been widely described as politically motivated,&lt;ref name="Rojanaphruk 2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/2016/12/18/look-inside-dhammakayas-besieged-temple/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180606115359/http://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/2016/12/18/look-inside-dhammakayas-besieged-temple/ |archive-date=6 June 2018 |dead-url=no |title=A Look Inside the Besieged Wat Dhammakaya|last1=Rojanaphruk|first1=Pravit|author-link=Pravit Rojanaphruk|date=18 December 2016|work=[[Khao Sod English]]|accessdate=20 December 2016|publisher=Matichon Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandala 2017"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newmandala.org/perplexing-case-wat-dhammakaya/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180606115409/http://www.newmandala.org/perplexing-case-wat-dhammakaya/ |archive-date=6 June 2018 |dead-url=no |title=The perplexing case of Wat Dhammakaya|last=Taylor|first=Jim|date=6 March 2017|work=New Mandala|access-date=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 2017" /&gt; and considered part of the campaigns by the junta to remove any traces of the influence of former Prime President [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], also known as the "de-Thaksinization" of Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mérieau|first1=Eugénie|title=Le pouvoir royal de nomination du patriarche suprême|trans-title=Royal authority in the nomination of the Supreme Patriarch |url= https://www.academia.edu/31320487/Le_Supr%C3%AAme_Patriarche_de_Tha%C3%AFlande_February_2017_ |accessdate= 10 February 2017 |work= Eclairage |date=February 2017 |page=41 |language=fr |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the end of the lockdown of the temple, the junta stated authorities will look for Luang Por Dhammajayo elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/thailand-ends-hunt-for-fugitive-monk-at-temple-but-continues-search-elsewhere |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180606115419/https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/thailand-ends-hunt-for-fugitive-monk-at-temple-but-continues-search-elsewhere |archive-date=6 June 2018 |dead-url=no |title=Thailand ends hunt for fugitive monk at temple, but continues search elsewhere|last=Arpon|first=Yasmin Lee|date=10 March 2017|work=[[The Straits Times]]|access-date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However investigations against the temple continued.

{{Mesopotamian myth|expanded=5}}
The ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n myth beginning '''Lugal-e ud me-lám-bi nir-ğál''', also known as ''[[Ninurta]]'s Exploits'' is a great epic telling of the warrior-god and god of spring thundershowers and floods, his deeds, waging war against his mountain rival [[Asag|á-sàg]] (“Disorder”; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: ''[[Asakku]]''), destroying cities and crushing skulls, restoration of the flow of the river [[Tigris]], returning from war in his “beloved barge” ''Ma-kar-nunta-ea'' and afterward judging his defeated enemies, determining the character and use of 49 stones, in 231 lines of the text.

It is actually named for the first word of the composition (lugal-e “king,” in the [[ergative case]]) in two first-millennium copies, although earlier (Old Babylonian) copies begin simply with lugal, omitting the case ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = From an antique land : an introduction to ancient Near Eastern literature | chapter = Sumerian Literature | author = Gonzalo Rubio | editor = Carl S.

==The myth==

The tale opens with a feast of Ninurta with the gods, where his wife conveys the word of the (human) king. The divine weapon [[Sharur (mythological weapon)|Šar’ur]] reports to Ninurta that the á-sàg demon, who has been appointed by the plants, has raided the border cities with his warriors, the rebellious stones who have tired of Ninurta's &lt;small&gt;NAMTAR&lt;/small&gt; (Akkadian: ''šīmtu'', "allocating tasks").&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Mesopotamian Magic: Textual, Historical, and Interpretative Perspectives | chapter = Magic in History. A Theoretical Perspective, and its application to Ancient Mesopotamia | author = W. van Binsbergen, F. Wiggermann | editor = I. Tzvi Abusch, K. Van Der Toorn | publisher = Styx Publications | year = 1999 | pages = 21–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The demon "tore the flesh of the Earth and covered her with painful wounds."&lt;ref name=kleinerman&gt;{{ cite book | title = Education in Early 2nd Millennium BC Babylonia | author =  Alexandra Kleinerman | publisher =  Brill | year = 2011 | pages = 105, 172, 176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|176}} This causes Ninurta impetuously to set out to preempt further attack. He is temporarily thwarted by a dust storm, until [[Enlil]] provides relief with a rainstorm, thus enabling Ninurta to overcome á-sàg and release the waters which have been trapped in mountain ice, preventing its irrigation of the Mesopotamian plains, and replenish the diminished flows of the river Tigris. He then placates the concerns of his mother, [[Ninlil]] or [[Ninmah|Ninmaḫ]] (depending on text), before exercising judgement over the stones who have collaborated with Azag. Finally he returns to [[Nippur]] to receive the praise of his father and the gods.

Ninurta assigns various fates to the minerals that have been conquered in his cosmic battle. The ''kurgarrānum''-stone is destined to be raw material for funerary figurines, “May you be made beautiful at [the festival] of ghosts, […for] nine [days] may the young men in a semi-circle make for you a doorway,”&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = The Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic: Introduction, Critical Edition and Cuneiform Texts (Volume 1) | author = A. R. George | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2003 | page = 127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the unfortunate ''šagara''-stone is doomed to be discarded, "You will be throne onto your bed", where no one will miss it and none will complain of its loss.&lt;ref name=kleinerman/&gt;{{rp|172}} In Ninurta’s blessing of the (diorite) ''esi''-stone, the material of statues: “When the king who “sets” his name for long days (to come) fashions those statues for future days, when he places them at the libation place in the Eninnu, the house filled with rejoicing, may you (=the diorite) then be present for that purpose as befits you,” the king being recalled may be an explicit allusion to [[Gudea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Gudea and His Dynasty (RIME 3/1) | author = Dietz Otto Edzard | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 1997 | page = 26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The parallels with many of Gudea’s inscriptions have suggested that the work mythically retells his campaigns against [[Anshan (Persia)|Anšan]] and [[Elam]]. The work may have been composed during or shortly after his reign (ca. 2150 BC) to honor Ningirsu, the titulary deity of [[Lagash|Lagaš]], and then transferred to Nippur when subsumed by Ninurta.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = The World's Oldest Literature: Studies in Sumerian Belles-Lettres | author = William W. Hallo | publisher = Brill | year = 2009 | page = 61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intended purpose of the composition, whether didactic or cultic, is uncertain although it may have been sung or recited following that of its sister work, [[Angim]], in performance of a temple ritual. There are ''sâlu'' and ''mukallimtu'' commentaries on the work listed in late [[Assyria]]n library catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title = On the Lugale Commentaries | author = I. L. Finkel | journal = RA | volume = 80 | year = 1986 | page = 190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its survival into the first millennium was due to the importance of Ninurta to the [[Assyria]]n cult.&lt;ref name=kleinerman/&gt;{{rp|105}}

==Biography==
Lodyzhensky was born on February 27, 1852 near [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] in the [[Russian Empire]]. He was the son of Vasily Vasilyevich and Olga Alekseyevna Lodyzhensky. Descended from a long line of Russian nobility, he was the distant relative of composer [[Nikolai Lodyzhensky]]. He had a religious upbringing and most of his immediate family—his father, mother, and three of his four sisters—all became monastics.&lt;ref name=Turgenev&gt;{{cite book|title=Tolstoi i Turgenev: Perepiska|year=1928|pages=96–97|editor=M. and S. Sabashnikov|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, Lodyzhensky graduated from the St. Petersburg Agricultural Institute. He served as a senior forester with the new Forestry Department of [[Vologda Governorate]]. In Tula, he was a land captain (overseer) of the [[Chernsky District]]. In 1881, he married his wife Olga Pavlovna (or Aleksandrovna according to some sources), which resulted in a happy marriage of over thirty years.&lt;ref name=Epopkina&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Epopkina|first=O. I.|encyclopedia=Tulsky kraevedchesky almanakh|title=Ladyzhensky Mitrofan Vasilyevich|url=http://www.tounb.ru/library/tula_region/history/ArticleByName.aspx?ArticleName=Ладыженский%20Митрофан%20Васильевич|accessdate=4 February 2013|language=Russian|edition=3rd|pages=107–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Lodyzhensky rose through the ranks of the Forestry Department, becoming its head from 1884–1886. He then consecutively served as lieutenant governor of several regions: [[Semey|Semipalatinsk]] (1896–1898),&lt;ref name="Turgenev"/&gt; [[Vitebsk Governorate|Vitebsk]], and [[Mogilev Governorate|Mogilev]].&lt;ref name=Fond&gt;{{cite book|title=Lichnye arkhivnye fondy v gosudarstvennykh khranilishchakh SSSR|year=1963|location=Moscow|page=385|url=http://www.rusarchives.ru/guide/lf_ussr/laa_leb.shtml#l46|editor=Yu. I. Gerasimov|language=Russian|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his years of public service, Lodyzhensky eventually reached the rank of [[State Counsellor (Russia)|state counsellor]] and was awarded with the [[Order of St. Vladimir]] (3rd and 4th class), the [[Order of Saint Stanislaus (Imperial House of Romanov)|Order of St. Stanislaus]] (2nd and 3rd class), and the [[Order of St. Anna]] (3rd class).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Putevoditel po fondam Gosudarstvennogo arkhiva Tulskoi oblasti|url=http://www.rusarchives.ru/guide/gatyo/flp16.shtml|accessdate=1 February 2013|language=Russian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831103620/http://www.rusarchives.ru/guide/gatyo/flp16.shtml|archivedate=31 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he always had financial difficulties and was forced to apply for a pension from the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]].&lt;ref name="Epopkina" /&gt; After retirement, he and his wife traveled the world, going to India, Egypt,&lt;ref name=Sofia&gt;{{cite book|last=Tolstoy|first=Sofia|title=The Diaries of Sophia Tolstoy|year=2010|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=9780062029362|pages=381|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vHx4ceDLapAC|edition=1st|editor=Cathy Porter|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan.&lt;ref name="Goldenweiser"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldenweiser|first=Alexander|title=Vblizi Tolstogo|year=1923|publisher=“Kooperat. izdatelstva”|location=Moscow|pages=185–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also took up literary work, writing several plays—''Iz novenkikh'' (''Brand New'') and ''Lozhny vzglyad'' (''False View'')—which performed well at the Russian Dramatic Theatre in Moscow.&lt;ref name="Epopkina" /&gt;

Lodyzhensky’s main interest, however, was in [[mysticism]] and [[esotericism]], especially [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. He was a member and secretary of the Russian Theosophical Society, and friends with the esotericist [[P.D. Ouspensky]]. Like [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[Lev Tikhomirov]], and other contemporary thinkers, he attempted to synthesize philosophy, religion, and mysticism into a unified way of life. He was familiar with the Hindu yogic tradition, drawing a parallel between it and Eastern Orthodox mysticism with the implicit belief that they were essentially the same. At a November 1909 meeting of the St. Petersburg Religious-Philosophical Society dedicated to Theosophy, Lodyzhensky declared, “It is possible to be a true Christian and a true Theosophist.” However, he later became convinced of the inherent incompatibility of Theosophy with Christianity, and reaffirmed his Russian Orthodox faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuraev|first=Andrei|title=Kto poslal Blavatskuyu?

In their reviews of ''Light Invisible'', Bishop Nikon (Bessonov) of Yenisei-Krasnoyarsk highly recommended it,&lt;ref name="Epopkina" /&gt; and Sergei Glagolev of the Moscow Theological Academy (despite some reservations) states that Lodyzhensky “simply, clearly, and convincingly established the apologetical significance of mystical phenomena from an Orthodox perspective.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lodyzhenskii|first=M. V.|title=Light Invisible: Satisfying the Thirst for Happiness|year=2011|publisher=Holy Trinity Publications|location=Jordanville, NY|isbn=9780884651871|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1910, Lodyzhensky and his wife Olga stayed in the village of Basovo, which was located only a few miles from [[Yasnaya Polyana]], the estate of the writer [[Leo Tolstoy]]. The Lodyzhenskys called upon Tolstoy in late July. The composer [[Alexander Goldenweiser (composer)|Alexander Goldenweiser]], one of Tolstoy’s close friends, refers to Lodyzhensky as “very loud and talkative,”&lt;ref name="Goldenweiser" /&gt; and [[Sofia Tolstaya|Sofia Tolstoy]], the author’s wife, describes the Lodyzhenskys as “interesting, lively people.”&lt;ref name="Sofia" /&gt; Lodyzhensky and Tolstoy spoke about yoga, hypnotism, Theosophy, and Christian asceticism, introducing him to the [[Philokalia]], one of the principal collections of spiritual texts for the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. A few days later, Tolstoy visited Lodyzhensky to continue the discussion on the Philokalia. This was their last meeting; Tolstoy died not long afterward.&lt;ref&gt;For Lodyzhensky’s account of his interactions with Tolstoy, see ''Light Invisible'', pp. 157ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later years, Lodyzhensky continued to write, collaborating with the St. Petersburg journal ''Veshnie vody'' (''Spring Waters'') and publishing his last work, ''Nevidimye volny'' (''Invisible Waves''), in 1917.&lt;ref name="Epopkina" /&gt;

Lodyzhensky died on May 31, 1917. He is buried with his wife Olga at the cemetery of the now-defunct Dormition Convent in Tula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preobrazhenskaya tserkov (khram byvshego Uspenskogo zhenskogo monastyrya)|url=http://www.vidania.ru/temple/temple_tulskaya/tula_preobrazenskaya_zerkov_uspenskii_monastyr.html|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free market principle is an [[Islam]]ic principle. Islam considers commodities with [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] as [[currency]]. The following are some examples of commodities that can be used as currency: gold (as [[Gold Dinar]]), silver (as [[Silver]] [[Dirham]]), rice, dates, wheat, barley and salt.

[[Paper money]] or [[electronic money]] can be used as long as it is backed by one of these commodities at a fixed exchange rate (in other words the paper is just a contract stipulating that the bearer can redeem the paper for a fixed measure (weight) of that particular commodity). Until 1971 most currencies of the world were backed by gold. However, only governments could redeem paper, not the average citizen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamic-finance.com/item104_f.htm Debt and the Gold Standard]. Islamic Finance. Accessed April 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The price of a [[commodity]] is set by the market as long as fiat currency (paper) is not used. On the other hand, the price/value of commodities can be manipulated/adjusted by the creators of [[fiat money]] (by virtue of the market law of supply and demand).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/article_3921.shtml Toward an Islamic Gold Standard].

As an avid dancer, Abdul was inspired towards a show business career by [[Gene Kelly]] in the film ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]''.&lt;ref name="Rollingstone"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Lyndsey|title=Paula Abdul's Favorite Choreography Moments of Her Career|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/paula-abduls-favorite-choreography-moments-of-her-career-20140718|website=rollingstone.com|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdul began taking dance lessons at an early age in [[ballet]], [[jazz]], and tap. She attended [[Van Nuys High School]], where she was a cheerleader and an honor student.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; At 15, she received a scholarship to a dance camp near [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], and in 1978 appeared in a low-budget Independent musical film, ''[[Junior High School (film)|Junior High School]]''.

Then I returned to television with ''American Idol'' and that took up a good decade of my life. Then I went out to do some more television, as well. I always wanted to get back on stage, because I missed it. I wanted to get back in close contact with the people who have supported me all throughout my career and be able to see them again. Plus, I was getting asked all the time if I would ever do it again! I finally said, You know what, I want to and I'm going to make it a priority.

==Personal life==
Abdul was married to [[Emilio Estevez]] from 1992 to 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20109752,00.html|title=Chatter – Unlikely Romances, Emilio Estevez, Paula Abdul|author=Cunningham, Kim|date=February 8, 1993|work=[[People (American magazine)|People]]|accessdate=August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20186997,00.html|title=Suddenly Single – Breakups, Barbra Streisand, Sally Field, Sharon Stone, Whoopi Goldberg|author=Glick, Elizabeth |date=August 29, 1994|work=[[People (American magazine)|People]]|accessdate=August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Abdul sought treatment for [[bulimia nervosa]], which she revealed years later she first developed as a teenager and which eating disorder only intensified after she became a pop star, explaining: "Battling bulimia has been like war on my body. Me and my body have been on two separate sides. We’ve never, until recently, been on the same side. I learned at a very early age I didn't fit in physically. I learned through years of rejections from auditions. I would ask myself, 'Why can’t I be tall and skinny like the other dancers?' I felt nervous and out of control, and all I could think about was food. Food numbed the fear and anxiety. I'd eat and then run to the bathroom. I thought, 'God I’m not perfect. I’m going to disappoint people. That’s what I thought. It became a living hell for me. I wanted to get help. I want to be free from weighing myself on the scales. Whether I was sticking my head in the toilet or exercising for hours a day, I was spitting out the food – and the feelings."&lt;ref name="YBR"/&gt; Abdul married clothing designer Brad Beckerman in 1996, at the New England Carousel Museum in [[Bristol, Connecticut]]. They divorced in 1998, after 17 months of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/36074/paula-abdul-splits-from-hubby|title=Paula Abdul Splits from Hubby|last=Errico|first=Marcus|date=March 10, 1998|website=[[E!

Abdul is observant in her Jewish faith,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Gershon Veroba|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yYrLwO0cIk |title=Paula Abdul... "a good Jewish girl."| medium=YouTube video|publisher=Gershon Veroba|location=Bel Air, California|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is proud of her heritage. She once stated, "My father is a Syrian Jew whose family immigrated to Brazil. My mother is Canadian with Jewish roots. My dream is to go to Israel for a real holiday." In November 2006, when Israeli Tourism Minister [[Isaac Herzog]] invited her to Israel, Abdul responded with a hug, adding, "I will come; you have helped me make a dream come true."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=YNET News|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3328923,00.html|title=Israeli minister, American Idol|date=November 17, 2006|accessdate=February 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, at the age of 51, Abdul had her [[bat mitzvah]] in Safed, Israel, at a [[Kabbalah]] center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/06/paula-abdul-bat-mitzvah-video-israel_n_4226165.html |title=Paula Abdul Celebrates Bat Mitzvah In Safed, Israel Known For kabbalah|work=Huffington Post|date= November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Abdul was reported as a practitioner of [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nancy |last=Cooke de Herrera |title=All You Need Is Love: An Eyewitness Account of When Spirituality Spread from the East to the West |publisher=Joodere Group |location=San Diego |year=2003 |page=438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2004, Abdul was driving her Mercedes Benz on a Los Angeles-area freeway when she changed lanes and hit another vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abdul sentenced for traffic accident|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/26/entertainment/et-quick26.3|work=Los Angeles Times|date=26 March 2005|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driver and passenger took a photograph with a cell phone camera and wrote down the license plate number of the car, which was traced to Abdul. In March 2005, Abdul was fined US$900 and given 24 months of informal [[probation]] after pleading ''[[nolo contendere]]'' (no contest) to [[misdemeanor]] [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit-and-run]] driving. She was ordered to pay US$775 for damage to the other car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/24/entertainment/main683012.shtml |title='Idol' Judge Fined For Hit-And-Run|work=CBS News|date=March 24, 2005|access-date= February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2005, Abdul said that she suffers from a neurological disorder, [[Complex regional pain syndrome|reflex sympathetic dystrophy]], that causes chronic pain. This disorder is also known as CRPS (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome).&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-04-20-paula-abdul_x.htm |title=Abdul says odd behavior not drug-related|work=USA Today|date=April 20, 2005|access-date=April 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, Abdul filed a report at a Hollywood police station claiming she had been a victim of battery at a private party at about 1{{nbsp}}am on April 2, according to LAPD spokesman Lt. Paul Vernon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paula Abdul tells police she was assaulted at LA party|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/things-do/2006-04-07/paula-abdul-tells-police-she-was-assaulted-la-party|work=Augusta Chronicle|accessdate=19 October 2017|date=April 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; "According to Abdul, the man at the party argued with her, grabbed her by the arm and threw her against a wall," Vernon said. "She said she had sustained a concussion and spinal injuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|url= http://entertainment.msn.com/tv/article.aspx?news=220585&amp;GT1=7703 |title=Paula Abdul Tells Police She Was Assaulted|work=MSN|date=April 6, 2006|access-date= February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, a 30-year-old woman named [[Paula Goodspeed]] was found dead in her car outside of Abdul's Los Angeles home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Nancy|last1=Dillon|title=Friends defend Paula Abdul fan who committed suicide| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/friends-defend-paula-abdul-fan-committed-suicide-article-1.334516|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death was ruled a suicide by overdose, and she was found surrounded by photos and CDs of Abdul. Goodspeed was an obsessive fan of Abdul's, having legally changed her name to Paula, drawn many pictures of the singer, and auditioned for Abdul on ''American Idol'' in 2005 at a stop in [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=6241069&amp;page=1 |title=Obsessive Fan of Paula Abdul Commits Suicide|date= November 13, 2008|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdul is a dog lover who raised awareness about [[National Guide Dog Month]] in May 2009, and she teamed up with [[Dick Van Patten]] to help people with blindness to have more independence through the help of guide dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/filmhound/archives/168170.asp?from=blog_last3|title=Paula Abdul &amp; Guide Dogs|date=May 7, 2009|accessdate=May 7, 2009|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|first=E.|last=Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt; She does not wear real fur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegloss.com/culture/paula-abduls-faux-fur-vest/ |title=Paula Abdul's faux fur vest|date= May 29, 2011|website= The Gloss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
In May 2005, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s news magazine ''[[Primetime Live]]'' reported claims by season 2 ''[[American Idol]]'' contestant [[Corey Clark]] that he and Abdul had had an affair during that season, and she had coached him on how to succeed in the competition.&lt;ref name="mtv cc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Corey Clark Says Paula Abdul 'Told Me She Loved Me'|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1501446/corey-clark-says-paula-abdul-told-me-she-loved-me/|website=MTV News|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Clark came forward at a time when he was marketing a CD and trying to get a book deal was seen as suspicious by some, but Clark maintains that his career was being prejudiced because of his relationship with Abdul, and that is why he came forward with the information to clear his name.&lt;ref name="mtv cc" /&gt; For the most part, Abdul refused to comment on Clark's allegations. [[Simon Cowell]] came to Abdul's defense,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paula Abdul: Simon Saved Me!|url=http://www.extratv.com/2007/01/10/paula-abdul-simon-saved-me/|work=The Extra!

TV |publisher=Time Telepictures Productions and Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution|access-date=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the debacle, Abdul appeared in a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' skit, making light of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7761754 |title=Abdul pokes fun at sex scandal on 'SNL'|work=[[MSNBC]]|date=May 11, 2005|access-date= February 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] launched an investigation, Abdul received numerous calls of support from celebrities, including [[Oprah Winfrey]] and [[Kelly Ripa]]; [[Barbara Walters]] addressed the camera during an episode of ABC's ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' to say she was sad to be part of an operation that would report Clark's flimsy tabloid claims under the guise of a news story. In August 2005, the Fox network confirmed that Abdul would be returning to the show, as the investigation had found "insufficient evidence that the communications between Mr. Clark and Ms. Abdul in any way aided his performance."&lt;ref&gt;[[{{cite news|agency=Associated Press]]|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8931265/ |title=After probe, Paula Abdul to remain on 'Idol'|work=[[MSNBC]]|date=August 24, 2005|access-date=February 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substance abuse allegations arose as the result of what some described as "erratic behavior"&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; by Abdul during episodes of ''American Idol.'' After reading these allegations on message boards, Abdul told ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'' in April 2005 that she had suffered from chronic pain for years following a "cheerleading accident" at age 17 and was diagnosed with [[complex regional pain syndrome|reflex sympathetic dystrophy]] (RSD) in November 2004.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Abdul says she is now pain-free following treatment, including the anti-inflammatory medication [[Enbrel]].&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Allegations arose again in January 2007 when videos circulated on the Internet of Abdul appearing to sway in her chair and slur her speech during a set of interviews.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16611216/ |title=Paula Abdul seen slurring in TV interview|agency=[[Reuters]]|work=[[MSNBC]]|date=January 15, 2007|access-date= April 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdul's publicist attributed this to fatigue and technical difficulties during the recording of the interviews.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; It was revealed on the Bravo show ''Hey Paula'', which had followed Abdul with a video camera prior to the interviews, that Abdul had not been sleeping, perhaps suffering from some mild form of insomnia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paula Abdul's loopy TV interviews blamed on exhaustion, insomnia, the flu, audio problems|url=http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/hey_paula/2007_Jun_29_breakdown_episode |date= June 29, 2007|website=Reality Blurred |author=Denhart, Andy |accessdate=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, Abdul told ''[[Us Weekly]]'' that she had never been drunk nor used illegal drugs, and called the allegations "lies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17138450/ |title=Paula Abdul claims she's 'squeaky clean'|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=MSNBC.com| date=February 13, 2007|access-date= February 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a March 2007 appearance on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', Abdul joked that her scrutinized behavior was caused by her being "abducted by aliens". In several interviews given in the late 2000s, Abdul said she had been left in debilitating pain after a 1992 car accident and a 1993 plane crash that required 15 spinal surgeries and which left her dependent on pain medication for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.theinsider.com/news/2118374_Paula_Abdul_Comes_Clean_About_Drugs|title=Paula Abdul Comes Clean About Drugs|work=The Insider|date=May 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'' posted an article on its website that said that Abdul told them she stayed at the [[Omni La Costa Resort and Spa|La Costa Resort and Spa]] in [[Carlsbad, California]] for three days the previous year to recover from [[physical dependence]] on prescription pain medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/122701/paula-abdul-no-painkillers-no-rehab|title=Paula Abdul: No Painkillers, No Rehab|website=Eonline.com|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="med"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20276698,00.html |title=Paula Abdul Reveals Struggle with Prescription Painkillers|work=[[People (American magazine)|People]]|date=5 May 2009|access-date= May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medications, prescribed due to injuries and her RSD diagnosis, included a pain patch, nerve medication, and a muscle relaxant. According to the article, Abdul said the medications made her "get weird" at times and that she suffered from physical [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms during her recovery.&lt;ref name="med"/&gt; Later that same week, in an interview with Detroit radio station [[WKQI]], Abdul rejected the article's accuracy. She told the radio station she never checked into a rehab clinic and never had a drug abuse problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.tvguide.com/American-Idol/Paula-Abdul-Denies-1005889.aspx?imw=Y|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120128175649/http://www.tvguide.com/American-Idol/Paula-Abdul-Denies-1005889.aspx?imw=Y|dead-url =yes|archive-date =January 28, 2012|title=Paula Abdul Denies Report She Abused Painkillers; Magazine Stands by Story|website=TVGuide.com|accessdate=May 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phnom Santuk''' is a hill and cultural site in the [[Cambodia]]n province of [[Kampong Thom Province|Kampong Thom]]. Located in [[Ko Koh]] village, [[Ko Koh]] commune, [[Santuk District]], it is the most sacred mountain of the province. The summit is accessed by a stone pathway with many statues flanking the way. At the top is a white-walled temple and many shrines and deities, including several reclining Buddhas made out of rock,&lt;ref name="Cambodia"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cambodia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5UTelRMB4BAC&amp;pg=PA286|accessdate=1 January 2013|publisher=Lonely Planet|pages=286|id=GGKEY:ALKFLS6LY8Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; measuring more than {{convert|33|ft}} in length.&lt;ref name="DK"/&gt; Monks inhabit the site.

==Geography==
Phnom Santuk is a hill of {{convert|679|ft}} elevation, which rises above the [[Tonlé Sap]] river valley.

==Features==
There are many Buddha images and pagodas enshrined along the way to the peak. New [[wat]]s in [[prasat style]] are under construction near the hilltop. [[Nāga#Cambodia|Nagas]] (serpent figures) and [[dragons]] are carved in profusion on these wats. Below the southern peak, at the base of the trees, there are many reclining Buddhas, some carved in rock in the earlier times and a few others are made of concrete in recent times. The multi-storied Chinese [[pagoda]] has a number of figurines made in [[porcelain]].&lt;ref name="Cambodia"/&gt; A ''[[panirvana]]'' sculpture, carved in rock of Buddha of the [[Theravada Buddhism]] period, dates to the sixteenth century. It is similar to the one found carved on a boulder in [[Prea Ang Thong]], and is also seen in the holy hill of Phnom Santuk.&lt;ref name="Harris2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Harris|title=Cambodian Buddhism: History and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rVnMxVz_Bg8C&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=1 January 2013|date=1 March 2008|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-3298-8|pages=2, 44, 62, 211–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature-based tourism is available at the Phnom Santuk Resort.&lt;ref name="Wood2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Timothy Dylan|title=Tracing the Last Breath: Movements in Anlong Veng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vPB_Npz1HfkC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=4 January 2013|year=2009|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-1-109-21799-5|pages=96–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Christian culture}}
The '''role of Christianity in civilization''' has been intricately intertwined with the [[History of Western civilization|history and formation of Western society]]. Throughout [[history of Christianity|its long history]], the [[Christian Church|Church]] has been a major source of social services like schooling and medical care; inspiration for [[Western art|art]], [[Western culture|culture]] and [[Western philosophy|philosophy]]; and influential player in politics and religion. In various ways it has sought to affect Western attitudes to vice and virtue in diverse fields. Festivals like [[Easter]] and [[Christmas]] are marked as public holidays; the [[Gregorian Calendar]] has been adopted internationally as the [[civil calendar]]; and the calendar itself is measured from the date of [[Jesus]]'s birth.

The cultural influence of the Church has been vast. Church scholars preserved literacy in Western Europe following the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Brooke|editor1-first=John H.|editor2-last=Numbers|editor2-first=Ronald L.|title=Science and Religion Around the World|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-195-32819-6|pages=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6HPW1TodZwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A9780195328196&amp;hl=vi&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], the Church rose to replace the Roman Empire as the unifying force in Europe. The cathedrals of that age remain among the most iconic feats of architecture produced by [[Western civilization]]. Many of [[Medieval university|Europe's universities]] were also founded by the church at that time. Many historians state that universities and [[cathedral school]]s were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, P. (2000). The Renaissance : a short history. Modern Library chronicles (Modern Library ed.). New York: Modern Library, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The university is generally regarded&lt;ref&gt;Rüegg, Walter: "Foreword. The University as a European Institution", in: ''A History of the University in Europe. Vol. 1: Universities in the Middle Ages'', Cambridge University Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-521-36105-2}}, pp. XIX–XX&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harnvb|Verger|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an institution that has its origin in the [[History of Christianity during the Middle Ages|Medieval Christian]] setting, born from [[Cathedral school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haskins | first1 = Charles H. | year = 1898 | title = The Life of Medieval Students as Illustrated by their Letters | url = | journal = The American Historical Review | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 203–229 | doi=10.2307/1832500}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Reformation]] brought an end to religious unity in the West, but the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance masterpieces]] produced by Catholic artists like [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Raphael]] at that time remain among the most celebrated works of art ever produced. Similarly, Christian [[church music|sacred music]] by composers like [[Johann Pachelbel|Pachelbel]], [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] is among the most admired [[classical music]] in the Western canon.

The Bible and Christian theology have also strongly influenced Western philosophers and political activists. The teachings of Jesus, such as the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]], are among the important sources for modern notions of Human Rights and the welfare measures commonly provided by governments in the West. Long held Christian teachings on sexuality and marriage and family life have also been both influential and (in recent times) controversial. Christianity played a role in ending practices such as human sacrifice, slavery,&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, Owen p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; infanticide and polygamy.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity in general affected the status of women by condemning [[marital infidelity]], [[divorce]], [[incest]], [[polygamy]], [[birth control]], [[infanticide]] (female infants were more likely to be killed), and [[abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;Stark, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; While official Church teaching&lt;ref name="Kreeft61"&gt;Kreeft, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; considers women and men to be [[complementarianism|complementary]] (equal and different), some modern "advocates of ordination of women and other feminists" argue that teachings attributed to [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] and those of the [[Church Fathers|Fathers of the Church]] and [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] theologians advanced the notion of a divinely ordained female inferiority.&lt;ref name="Bokenkotter465"&gt;Bokenkotter, p. 465&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, [[Women in Christianity|women have played prominent roles]] in Western history through and as part of the church, particularly in education and healthcare, but also as influential theologians and mystics.

Christianity [[Jewish Christians#Jewish origin of Christianity|began as a Jewish sect]] in the mid-1st century arising out of the life and teachings of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. The life of Jesus is recounted in the [[New Testament view on Jesus' life|New Testament]] of the Bible, one of the bedrock texts of Western Civilization and inspiration for countless works of [[Western art]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;[[BBC]], [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/ ''BBC—Religion &amp; Ethics—566, Christianity'']&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus' birth is commemorated in the festival of Christmas, his death during the [[Paschal Triduum]], and what Christians believe to be his resurrection during Easter. Christmas and Easter remain holidays in many Western nations. Jesus learned the texts of the Hebrew Bible, with its [[Ten Commandments]] (which later became influential in Western law) and became an influential wandering preacher. He was a persuasive teller of [[parable]]s and moral philosopher who urged followers to worship God, act without violence or prejudice and care for the sick, hungry and poor. These teachings have been deeply influential in Western culture. Jesus criticized the privilege and hypocrisy of the religious establishment which drew the ire of the authorities, who persuaded the Roman Governor of the [[Iudaea Province|province of Judaea]], [[Pontius Pilate]], to have him executed. The Tanakh says Jesus was executed for sorcery and for leading the people into apostacy.&lt;ref name="Nancy L.

The early followers of Jesus, including [[Saint]]s [[St Paul|Paul]] and [[St Peter|Peter]] carried this new theology concerning Jesus throughout the Roman Empire and beyond, sowing the seeds for the development of the [[Catholic Church]], of which Saint Peter is remembered as the first Pope. Catholicism, as we know it, emerged slowly. Christians often [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|faced persecution]] during these early centuries, particularly for their refusal to join in [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|worshiping the emperors]]. Nevertheless, carried through the synagogues, merchants and missionaries across the known world, the new internationalist religion quickly grew in size and influence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  It's unique appeal was partly the result of its values and ethics.&lt;ref name="George H. van Kooten"&gt;{{cite book|last=van Kooten| first=George H.|editor=D.

The New Testament refers to a number of women in Jesus’ inner circle. There are several Gospel accounts of Jesus imparting important teachings to and about women: his meeting with the Samaritan woman at the well, his anointing by Mary of Bethany, his public admiration for a poor widow who donated two copper coins to the Temple in Jerusalem, his stepping to the aid of the woman accused of adultery, his friendship with Mary and Martha the sisters of Lazarus, and the presence of Mary Magdalene, his mother, and the other women as he was crucified.  Historian Geoffrey Blainey concludes that "as the standing of women was not high in Palestine, Jesus' kindnesses towards them were not always approved by those who strictly upheld tradition."&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Blaney"&gt;{{cite book| last=Blaney| first=Geoffrey| title =A Short History of Christianity| year=2014| publisher=Rowman and Littlefield| location=Lanham, Maryland| isbn=978-1-4422-2589-3|pages=19, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Christian apologist Tim Keller, it was common in the Greco-Roman world to expose female infants because of the low status of women in society.  The church forbade its members to do so.  Greco-Roman society saw no value in an unmarried woman, and therefore it was illegal for a widow to go more than two years without remarrying. Christianity did not force widows to marry and supported them financially. Pagan widows lost all control of their husband's estate when they remarried, but the church allowed widows to maintain their husband's estate.  Christians did not believe in cohabitation. If a Christian man wanted to live with a woman, the church required marriage, and this gave women legal rights and far greater security.  Finally, the pagan double standard of allowing married men to have extramarital sex and mistresses was forbidden. Jesus' teachings on divorce and Paul's advocacy of monogamy began the process of elevating the status of women so that Christian women tended to enjoy greater security and equality than did women in surrounding cultures.&lt;ref name="Tim Keller"&gt;{{cite book| last=Keller|first=Tim|title =The Reason for God Belief in an age of skepticism| year=2008| publisher=Penguin Books| location=New York| isbn=978-0-52595-049-3| page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Children=====
In the ancient world infanticide was not legal but was rarely prosecuted.  A broad distinction was popularly made between infanticide and infant exposure which was practiced on a gigantic scale with impunity. Many exposed children died, but many were taken by speculators who raised them to be slaves or prostitutes. &lt;!-- Is this appropriate here? --&gt; It is not possible to ascertain, with any degree of accuracy, what diminution of infanticide resulted from legal efforts against it in the Roman empire.  "It may, however, be safely asserted that the publicity of the trade in exposed children became impossible under the influence of Christianity, and that the sense of the seriousness of the crime was very considerably increased."&lt;ref name="W. E. H. Lecky"/&gt;{{rp|31,32}}

====Constantine====
[[Emperor Constantine]]'s [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 AD ended the state sponsored persecution of Christians in the East and his own conversion to Christianity was a significant turning point in history.&lt;ref&gt;Religion in the Roman Empire, Wiley-Blackwell, by James B. Rives, page 196&lt;/ref&gt; In 312, Constantine offered civic toleration to Christians, and through his reign instigated laws and policies in keeping with Christian principles – making Sunday the Sabbath "day of rest" for Roman society (though initially this was only for urban dwellers) and embarking on a church building program. In AD 325, Constantine conferred the [[First Council of Nicaea]] to gain consensus and unity within Christianity, with a view to establishing it as the religion of the Empire. The population and wealth of the Roman Empire had been shifting east, and around the year 330, Constantine established the city of [[Constantinople]] as a new imperial city which would be the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]]. The Eastern Patriarch in Constantinople now came to rival the Pope in Rome and Rome itself was [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacked by the Visigoths]] in 410 and the [[Sack of Rome (455)|Vandals in 455]]. Although cultural continuity and interchange would continue between these Eastern and Western Roman Empires, the [[history of Christianity]] and Western culture took divergent routes, with a final [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] separating [[Roman Catholicism|Roman]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern]] Christianity in 1054AD.

[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 005.jpg|thumb|upright|''Saint Ambrose and Emperor Theodosius'', [[Anthony van Dyck]].]]
[[File:Gregorythegreat.jpg|thumb|upright|Pope [[Gregory the Great]] (''c'' 540–604) who established medieval themes in the Church, in a painting by [[Carlo Saraceni]], c. 1610, Rome.]]

The remarkable transformation of Christianity from peripheral sect, to major force within the Empire is illustrated by the influence held by [[St Ambrose]], the [[Bishop of Milan]]. A [[Doctor of the Church]] and one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the 4th century, Ambrose became a player in Imperial politics, courted for his influence by competing contenders for the Imperial throne. When the Emperor [[Theodosius I]] ordered the [[Massacre of Thessaloniki|punitive massacre of thousands of the citizens]] of [[Thessaloniki]], Ambrose admonished him publicly, refused him the Eucharist and called on him to perform a public penance, a call to which the Christian Emperor submitted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/St. Ambrose]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Randall D. Law"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Law| editor-first=Randall D.| title=The Routledge History of Terrorism|year=2015| publisher=Routledge| location=New York| isbn=978-0-415-53577-9| pages=46–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[paganism]] in the Roman Empire was not yet finished, the episode prefigured the role of the Church in the political life of Europe in coming centuries.

Theodosius reigned (albeit for a brief interim) as the last Emperor of a united Eastern and Western Roman Empire. In 391 Theodosius sought to block the restoration of the pagan [[Altar of Victory]] to the Roman Senate and then fought against [[Eugenius]], who courted pagan support for his own bid for the imperial throne. Thus, the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' lauds Theodosius as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14577d.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Theodosius I|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[O]ne of the sovereigns by universal consent called Great. He stamped out the last vestiges of paganism, put an end to the [[Arianism|Arian heresy]] in the empire, pacified the Goths, left a famous example of penitence for a crime, and reigned as a just and mighty Catholic emperor.}}

====Fourth Century====
During the fourth century, Christian writing and theology blossomed into a “Golden Age” of literary and scholarly activity unmatched since the days of Virgil and Horace. Many of these works remain influential in politics, law, ethics and other fields.  A new genre of literature was also born in the fourth century: church history.&lt;ref name="Isaac Padinjarekutt"&gt;{{cite book| last=Padinjarekutt| first=Isaac| title=Christianity Through The Centuries|year=2005|publisher=St.Paul's| location=Mumbai|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jonathan Bardill"&gt;{{cite book| last=Bardill|first=Jonathan| title=Constantine, Divine Emperor of the Christian Golden Age| year=2012| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=New York| isbn=978-0-521-76423-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Fall of Rome====
After the [[Fall of Rome]] culture in the west returned to a subsistence agrarian form of life. What little security there was in this world was provided by the Christian church.&lt;ref name ="Cuthbert Butler"&gt;{{cite book| last=Butler|first=Cuthbert| title=Benedictine Monachism: Studies in Benedictine Life and Rule| year=1919| publisher=Longmans, Green and Company| location=New York|pages=3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roy T.

In the absence of a [[magister militum]] living in Rome, even the control of military matters fell to the pope. [[Gregory the Great]] (''c'' 540–604) administered the church with strict reform. A trained Roman lawyer and administrator, and a monk, he represents the shift from the classical to the medieval outlook and was a father of many of the structures of the later Roman Catholic Church. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, he looked upon Church and State as co-operating to form a united whole, which acted in two distinct spheres, ecclesiastical and secular, but by the time of his death, the papacy was the great power in Italy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06780a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Gregory the Great|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[ [[Pope Gregory the Great]] ] made himself in Italy a power stronger than emperor or exarch, and established a political influence which dominated the peninsula for centuries. From this time forth the varied populations of Italy looked to the pope for guidance, and Rome as the papal capital continued to be the centre of the Christian world.}}

=====The Dark Ages=====
The period between 500 and 700, often referred to as the "Dark Ages," could also be designated the "Age of the Monk". Christian aesthetes, like St.Benedict (480–543) vowed a life of chastity, obedience and poverty, and after rigorous intellectual training and self-denial, lived by the “Rule of Benedict.” This “Rule” became the foundation of the majority of the thousands of monasteries that spread across what is modern day Europe; "...certainly there will be no demur in recognizing that St.Benedict's Rule has been one of the great facts in the history of western Europe, and that its influence and effects are with us to this day."&lt;ref name ="Cuthbert Butler"/&gt;{{rp|intro.}}

[[Charlemagne]] ("Charles the Great" in English) became king of the Franks in 768. He conquered the [[Low Countries]], Saxony, and northern and central Italy, and in 800, [[Pope Leo III]] crowned Charlemagne [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Sometimes called the "Father of Europe," Charlemagne instituted political and judicial reform and led what is sometimes referred to as the Early or Christian Renaissance.&lt;ref name="Roger Collins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins| first=Roger| title=Charlemagne| year=1998| publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto, Canada|isbn=0-8020-8218-1|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], likened the Catholic Church in its activities during the Middle Ages to an early version of a welfare state: "It conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young; hospices for the sick of all ages; places for the lepers; and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal". It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and by owning large farmlands and estates.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011; pp 214–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

====High Middle Ages====
By the late 11th century, beginning with the efforts of [[Pope Gregory VII]], the Church successfully established itself as "an autonomous legal and political ... [entity] within Western Christendom".&lt;ref name=witte23&gt;Witte (1997), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next several hundred years, the Church held great influence over Western society;&lt;ref name=witte23/&gt; church laws were the single "universal law ... common to jurisdictions and peoples throughout Europe", giving the Church "preeminent authority".&lt;ref name=witte30&gt;Witte (1997), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; With its own court system, the Church retained jurisdiction over many aspects of ordinary life, including education, inheritance, oral promises, oaths, moral crimes, and marriage.&lt;ref name=witte31&gt;Witte (1997), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the more powerful institutions of the Middle Ages, Church attitudes were reflected in many secular laws of the time.&lt;ref name="Power, p 1"&gt;Power, p 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church was very powerful, essentially internationalist and democratic in it structures and run by monastic organisations generally following [[Benedictine]] rule. Men of a scholarly bent usually took [[Holy Orders]] and frequently joined [[religious institute]]s. Those with intellectual, administrative or diplomatic skill could advance beyond the usual restraints of society – leading churchmen from faraway lands were accepted in local bishoprics, linking European thought across wide distances. Complexes like the [[Abbey of Cluny]] became vibrant centres with dependencies spread throughout Europe. Ordinary people also treked vast distances on [[pilgrimage]]s to express their piety and pray at the site of [[holy relics]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Clarke; Civilisation, BBC, SBN 563 10279 9; first published 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Inquisition=====
{{Main|Inquisition}}
The Inquisitions were religious courts originally created to protect faith and society by identifying and condemning heretics.&lt;ref name="Roy T. Matthews"/&gt;{{rp|250}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08026a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inquisition|The Medieval Inquisition]] existed from 1184 to the 1230s and was created in response to dissidents accused of heresy, while the [[Papal Inquisition]] (1230's-1302) was created to restore order disrupted by mob violence against heretics. "The [Medieval] Inquisition was not an organization arbitrarily devised and imposed upon the judicial system of Christendom by the ambition or fanaticism of the church. It was rather a natural—one may almost say an inevitable—evolution of the forces at work in the thirteenth century...  As the twelfth century drew to a close the church was facing a crisis..."&lt;ref name="Henry Charles Lea"&gt;{{cite book| last=Lea| first=Henry Charles| title=A History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages Volumes 1,2,3|volume=1| year=1887|publisher=Harper and Brothers| location=New York|page = Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; This crisis centered around dissidents, the ever-increasing power of the secular state, the declining power of the papacy, and the gradual disintegration of Christendom.&lt;ref name="Edward Peters"&gt;{{cite book| last=Peters| first=Edward| title=Inquisition| year=1989| publisher=University of California Press| location=Berkley, Cal.| isbn=0-520-06630-8|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Medieval Inquisitions were suspended, the Catholic Inquisitions known as the [[Roman Inquisition|Roman]], the [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and the [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s, were begun with the Spanish lasting four centuries into the 1800s.&lt;ref name= "Edward Peters"/&gt;{{rp|154}}

====Late Middle Ages====
=====Women=====
In the 13th-century Roman Pontifical, the prayer for ordaining women as deacons was removed, and ordination was re-defined and applied only to male Priests.

Woman-as-witch became a stereotype in the 1400s until it was codified in 1487 by Pope Innocent VIII who declared "most witches are female." "The European witch stereotype embodies two apparent paradoxes: first, it was not produced by the "barbaric Dark Ages," but during the progressive Renaissance and the early modern period; secondly, Western Christianity did not recognize the reality of witches for centuries, or criminalize them until around 1400."&lt;ref name="Margaret Schaus"&gt;{{cite book| last=Schaus| first=Margaret| title=Women and Gender in Medieval Europe: An Encyclopedia| year=2006| publisher=Routledge Taylor and Francis Group| location=New York| isbn =978-0-415-96944-4| page=842-842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Don Swenson says the explanation for this may lay in the nature of Medieval society as heirocratic which led to violence and the use of coercion to force conformity. "There has been much debate ...as to how many women were executed...[and estimates vary wildly, but numbers] small and large do little to portray the horror and dishonor inflicted upon these women. This treatment provides [dramatic] contrast to the respect given to women during the early era of Christianity and in early Europe..."&lt;ref name="Don Swenson"&gt;{{cite book| last=Swenson|first=Don| title=Society, Spirituality, and the Sacred: A Social Scientific Introduction| year=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were in many respects excluded from political and mercantile life; however, some leading churchwomen were exceptions. Medieval abbesses and female superiors of monastic houses were powerful figures whose influence could rival that of male bishops and abbots: "They treated with kings, bishops, and the greatest lords on terms of perfect equality;... they were present at all great religious and national solemnities, at the dedication of churches, and even, like the queens, took part in the deliberation of the national assemblies...".&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01007e.htm (Montalembert, "The Monks of the West," Bk. XV.)&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing popularity of [[Roman Catholic Mariology|devotion to the Virgin Mary]] (the mother of Jesus) secured maternal virtue as a central cultural theme of Catholic Europe. Kenneth Clarke wrote that the 'Cult of the Virgin' in the early 12th century "had taught a race of tough and ruthless barbarians the virtues of tenderness and compassion".&lt;ref name="Civilisation, BBC 1969"&gt;[[Kenneth Clarke]]; ''Civilisation'', BBC, SBN 563 10279 9; first published 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The Popes=====
In 1054, after centuries of strained relations, the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] occurred over differences in doctrine, splitting the Christian world between the [[Catholic Church]], centered in Rome and dominant in the West, and the [[Orthodox Church]], centered in [[Constantinople]], capital of the Byzantine Empire.

Relations between the major powers in Western society: the nobility, monarchy and clergy, sometimes produced conflict. Pope's were powerful enough to challenge the authority of kings. The [[Investiture Controversy]] was perhaps the most significant conflict between [[Church and state in medieval Europe]]. A series of Popes challenged the authority of monarchies over control of appointments, or [[investiture]]s, of church officials. The Court of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], based in Sicily, saw tension and rivalry with the Papacy over control of Northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06255a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Frederick Ii |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 September 1909 |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Avignon Papacy|Papacy had its court at Avignon]] from 1305–78&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;Morris, Colin, ''The papal monarchy: the Western church from 1050 to 1250 '', (Oxford University Press, 2001), 271.&lt;/ref&gt; This arose from the conflict between the Italian Papacy and the French crown.

"The Popes in the fourteenth to the mid-fifteenth century turned their interest to the arts and humanities rather than to pressing moral and spiritual issues.  Moreover, they were vitally concerned with the trappings of political power. They plunged into Italian politics...ruling as secular princes in their papal lands. Their worldly interests and blatant political maneuverings only intensified the mounting disapproval of the papacy and provided the church's critics with more examples of the institution's corruption and decline."&lt;ref name="Roy T. Matthews"/&gt;{{rp|248}}  This period produced ever more extravagant art and architecture, but also the virtuous simplicity of such as [[St Francis of Assisi]] (expressed in the [[Canticle of the Sun]]) and the epic poetry of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. As the Church grew more powerful and wealthy, many sought reform. The [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and [[Franciscan]] Orders were founded, which emphasized poverty and spirituality.

====Crusade====
In 1095, [[Pope Urban II]] called for a [[Crusades|Crusade]] to re-take the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim]] rule.
 
"After Mohammad's death in 632, a series of caliphs (successors) waged energetic [[jihad]] against neighboring people's. Palestine, Syria, Persia, and Egypt—once the most heavily Christian areas in the world—quickly succumbed. By the eighth century, Muslim armies had conquered all of Christian North Africa and Spain and were moving into France. In 732, at the Battle of Tours, Charles Martel defeated Muslim invaders and sent them back into Spain. By the eleventh century, the Seljuk Turks had conquered Asia Minor (modern Turkey), which had been Christian since the time of St. Paul. The holdings of the old Roman Empire, known to modern historians as the Byzantine Empire, were reduced to little more than Greece. In desperation, the emperor in Constantinople sent word to the Christians of western Europe asking them to aid their brothers and sisters in the East."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catholicity.com/commentary/madden/03463.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas F. Madden"&gt;{{cite book| last=Madden| first=Thomas F.| title=The Concise History of the Crusades| edition= Third| year=2014| publisher=Rowman and Littlefield| location=New York| isbn=978-1-4422-1574-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first crusade, but the "Colossus of the Medieval world was Islam, not Christendom" and despite initial success, the conflicts, which lasted four centuries, ultimately ended in a failure to retake the "Holy Land" and only barely prevented the taking of the European continent.&lt;ref name="Thomas F. Madden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roy T. Matthews"/&gt;{{rp|192}}

Historian Jonathan Riley-Smith says scholars are turning away from the idea subsequent crusades were materially motivated. A more complex picture of nobles and knights making sacrifices has emerged creating an increased interest in the religious and social ideas of the laity. Crusading can no longer be defined solely as warfare against Muslims; the crusades were religious wars and the crusaders moved by ideas; and the issue of colonialism is no longer one considered worthy of serious discussion.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Riley-Smith"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Riley-Smith |first1=Jonathan |title=What Were the Crusades? |date=2009 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=978-1-58617-360-9 |pages=ix-xvii |edition= Fourth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human Rights====
"The philosophical foundation of the liberal concept of human rights can be found in natural law theories,"&lt;ref name="Levent Gönenç"&gt;{{cite book| last=Gönenç| first=Levent| title=Prospects for Constitutionalism in Post-Communist Countries| year=2002| publisher=Kluwer Law International| location=The Netherlands| isbn=90-411-1836-5| page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David Kim"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Kim|editor1-first=David|editor2-last=Kaul|editor2-first=Susanne|title=Imagining Human Rights|year=2015|publisher=de Gruyter| location=Berlin, Germany|isbn=978-3-11-037619-7|pages=13–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much thinking on natural law is traced to the thought of the Dominican friar, Thomas Aquinas.&lt;ref name="John Goyette"&gt;{{cite book| editor1-last=Goyette| editor1-first=John| editor2-last= Latkovic| editor2-first=Mark S.| editor3-last=Myers| editor3-first=Richard S.|title=St. Thomas Aquinas and the Natural Law Tradition: Contemporary Perspectives| year=2004| publisher=The Catholic University of America Press| location=Washington D.C.| isbn=0-8132-1378-9| page =Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aquinas, every law is ultimately derived from what he calls the 'eternal law': God’s ordering of all created things. For Aquinas, a human action is good or bad depending on whether it conforms to reason, and it is this participation in the 'eternal law' by the 'rational creature' that is called “natural law.” Aquinas said natural law is a fundamental principle that is woven into the fabric of human nature. Secularists such as Hugo Grotius later expanded the idea of human rights and built on it. Aquinas continues to influence the works of leading political and legal philosophers.&lt;ref name="John Goyette"/&gt;

"...one cannot and need not deny that Human Rights are of Western Origin. It cannot be denied, because they are morally based on the Judeo-Christian tradition and Graeco-Roman philosophy; they were codified in the West over many centuries, they have secured an established position in the national declarations of western democracies, and they have been enshrined in the constitutions of those democracies."&lt;ref name="Joe Barth Abba"&gt;{{cite book| last =Abba| first=Joe Barth| title=Philosophy of Thomas Aquinas on Justice and Human Rights: A Paradigm for the Africa-cultural Conflicts Resolution-Nigerian Perspectives| year=2017| publisher=Deutsche Nationalbibliothek| location=Zürich| isbn=978-3-643-90909-1| page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Howard Tumber says, "human rights is not a universal doctrine, but is the descendent of one particular religion (Christianity)."  This does not suggest Christianity has been superior in its practice or has not had "its share of human rights abuses".&lt;ref name="Howard Tumber"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Tumber|editor1-first=Howard|editor2-last=Waisbord| editor2-first=Silvio| title=The Routledge Companion to Media and Human Rights|year=2017|publisher=Routledge| location=New York| isbn=978-1-138-66554-5|pages=412–414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Gushee says Christianity has a "tragically mixed legacy" when it comes to the application of its own ethics.  He examines three cases of "Christendom divided against itself": the crusades and Frances' attempt at peacemaking with Muslims; Spanish conquerors and the killing of indigenous peoples and the protests against it; and the on-again off-again persecution and protection of Jews.&lt;ref name="David Gushee"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gushee|first=David|title=The Sacredness of Human Life: Why an Ancient Biblical Vision Is Key to the World's Future| year=2013| publisher=Eerdman's|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan| isbn=978-0-8028-4420-0| pages=164–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformation until Modern era===
[[File:Façade de la cathédrale Saint-Pierre de Genève.jpg|thumb|right|Calvin preached at [[St. Pierre Cathedral]], the main church in Geneva.]]
In the Middle Ages, the Church and the worldly authorities were closely related. [[Martin Luther]] separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle ([[doctrine of the two kingdoms]]).&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Bornkamm, ''Toleranz. In der Geschichte des Christentums'' in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band VI (1962), col. 937&lt;/ref&gt; The believers were obliged to use reason to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way. Luther's doctrine of the [[priesthood of all believers]] upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably. The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and, if necessary, to vote for his dismissal (Treatise ''On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call, install and dismiss teachers, as testified in Scripture''; 1523).&lt;ref&gt;Original German title: ''Dass eine christliche Versammlung oder Gemeine Recht und Macht habe, alle Lehre zu beurteilen und Lehrer zu berufen, ein- und abzusetzen: Grund und Ursach aus der Schrift''&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen ([[church elder]]s, [[presbyter]]s) in his representative church government.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton E. Olmstead, ''History of Religion in the United States'', pp. 4–10&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Huguenots]] added regional [[synod]]s and a national synod, whose members were elected by the congregations, to Calvin's system of church self-government. This system was taken over by the other Reformed churches.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Heussi, ''Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte'', 11. Auflage, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, [[John Calvin]] favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy. He appreciated the advantages of democracy: "It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jan Weerda, ''Calvin'', in ''Evangelisches Soziallexikon'', 3. Auflage (1958), Stuttgart (Germany), col. 210&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God. To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances ([[separation of powers]]). Thus he and his followers resisted political [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton E. Olmstead, ''History of Religion in the United States'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Besides England, the Netherlands were, under Calvinist leadership, the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It granted asylum to philosophers like [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Pierre Bayle]]. [[Hugo Grotius]] was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Heussi, ''Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte'', S. 396–397&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent with Calvin's political ideas, Protestants created both the English and the American democracies. In 17th-century England, the most important persons and events in this process were the [[English Civil War]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[John Milton]], [[John Locke]], the [[Glorious Revolution]], the [[English Bill of Rights]], and the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. M. Schmidt, ''England. Kirchengeschichte'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band II (1959), Tübingen (Germany), col. 476–478&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the British took their democratic ideals also to their colonies, e.g. Australia, New Zealand, and India. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the British variety of modern-time democracy, [[constitutional monarchy]], was taken over by Protestant-formed Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands as well as the Catholic countries Belgium and Spain. In North America, [[Plymouth Colony]] ([[Pilgrim Fathers]]; 1620) and [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] (1628) practised democratic self-rule and [[separation of powers]].&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Philbrick (2006), ''Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War'', Penguin Group, New York, N.Y., {{ISBN|0-670-03760-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clifton E. Olmstead, ''History of Religion in the United States'', pp. 65–76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Fennell (1998), ''Plymouth Colony Legal Structure'', (http://www.histarch.uiuc.edu/plymouth/ccflaw.html)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanover Historical Texts Project (http://history.hanover.edu/texts/masslib.html)&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Congregationalist]]s were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God.&lt;ref&gt;M. Schmidt, ''Pilgerväter'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart, 3. Auflage, Band V (1961), col. 384&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mayflower Compact]] was a [[social contract]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Fennell, ''Plymouth Colony Legal Structure''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen Weinstein and David Rubel (2002), ''The Story of America: Freedom and Crisis from Settlement to Superpower'', DK Publishing, Inc., New York, N.Y., {{ISBN|0-7894-8903-1}}, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual morals==
Historian Kyle Harper says {{quote|"...the triumph of Christianity not only drove profound cultural change, it created a new relationship between sexual morality and society... The legacy of Christianity lies in the dissolution of an ancient system where social and political status, power, and [[social reproduction|the transmission of social inequality to the next generation]] scripted the terms of sexual morality."}}&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"&gt;{{cite book| last=Harper| first=Kyle| title=From Shame to Sin: The Christian Transformation of Sexual Morality in Late Antiquity| year=2013| publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusettes| isbn=978-0-674-07277-0 |page=4,7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the ancient Greeks and the Romans cared and wrote about sexual morality within categories of good and bad, pure and defiled, and ideal and transgression.&lt;ref name="Rebecca Langlands"&gt;{{cite book| last=Langlands| first=Rebecca| title=Sexual Morality in Ancient Rome|year=2006| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge, UK| isbn=978-0-521-85943-1| page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the sexual ethical structures of Roman society were built on status, and sexual modesty meant something different for men than it did for women, and for the well-born, than it did for the poor, and for the free citizen, than it did for the slave—for whom the concepts of honor, shame and sexual modesty could be said to have no meaning at all.&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|7}} Slaves were not thought to have an interior ethical life because they could go no lower socially and were commonly used sexually; the free and well born were thought to embody social honor and were therefore able to exhibit the fine sense of shame suited to their station.  Roman literature indicates the Romans were aware of these dualities.&lt;ref name="Rebecca Langlands"/&gt;{{rp|12,20}}

Shame was a profoundly social concept that was, in ancient Rome, always mediated by gender and status. "It was not enough that a wife merely regulate her sexual behavior in the accepted ways; it was required that her virtue in this area be conspicuous."&lt;ref name="Rebecca Langlands"/&gt;{{rp|38}}  Men, on the other hand, were allowed live-in mistresses called ''pallake.''&lt;ref name="John Younger"&gt;{{cite book| last=Younger| first=John| title=Sex in the Ancient World from A to Z|year=2005| publisher=Routledge| location= New York| isbn=978-0-415-24252-3| page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; This permitted Roman society to find both a husband's control of a wife's sexual behavior a matter of intense importance and at the same time see his own sex with young boys as of little concern.&lt;ref name="Rebecca Langlands"/&gt;{{rp|12,20}}  Christianity sought to establish equal sexual standards for men and women and to protect all the young whether slave or free. This was a transformation in the deep logic of sexual morality.&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|6,7}}

Early Church Fathers advocated against adultery, polygamy, homosexuality, pederasty, bestiality, prostitution, and incest while advocating for the sanctity of the marriage bed.&lt;ref name="witte20"&gt;Witte (1997), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  The central Christian prohibition against such ''porneia'', which is a single name for that array of sexual behaviors, "collided with deeply entrenched patterns of Roman permissiveness where the legitimacy of sexual contact was determined primarily by status. St.Paul, whose views became dominant in early Christianity, made the body into a consecrated space, a point of mediation between the individual and the divine. Same-sex attraction spelled the estrangement of men and women at the very deepest level of their inmost desires. Paul's over-riding sense that gender—rather than status or power or wealth or position—was the prime determinant in the propriety of the sex act was momentous. By boiling the sex act down to the most basic constituents of male and female, Paul was able to describe the sexual culture surrounding him in transformative terms."&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|12,92}}

Christian sexual ideology is inextricable from its concept of freewill. "In its original form, Christian freewill was a cosmological claim—an argument about the relationship between God's justice and the individual... as Christianity became intermeshed with society, the discussion shifted in revealing ways to the actual psychology of volition and the material constraints on sexual action... The church's acute concern with volition places Christian philosophy in the liveliest currents of imperial Greco-Roman philosophy [where] orthodox Christians offered a radically distinctive version of it."&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|14}} The Greeks and Romans said our deepest moralities depend on our social position which is given to us by fate.  Christianity "preached a liberating message of freedom. It was a revolution in the rules of behavior, but also in the very image of the human being as a sexual being, free, frail and awesomely responsible for one's own self to God alone.  It was a revolution in the nature of society's claims on the moral agent... There are risks in over-estimating the change in old patterns Christianity was able to begin bringing about; but there are risks, too, in underestimating Christianization as a watershed."&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|14–18}}

The teachings of the Church have also been used to "establish[...] the status of women under the law".&lt;ref name="power1and2"/&gt; There has been some debate as to whether the Church has improved the status of women or hindered their progress.
[[File:Svatba (2).jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Christian views on marriage|Orthodox wedding]], Cathedral of Ss. Cyrill and Methodius, Prague, Czech Republic.]]
From the beginning of the thirteenth century, the Church formally recognized [[Fruit of the Holy Spirit|marriage between a freely consenting, baptized man and woman]] as a [[sacrament]]—an outward sign communicating a special gift of God's love. The [[Council of Florence]] in 1438 gave this definition, following earlier Church statements in 1208, and declared that sexual union was a special participation in the union of Christ in the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09707a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Sacrament of Marriage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Puritans]], while highly valuing the institution, viewed marriage as a "civil", rather than a "religious" matter, being "under the jurisdiction of the civil courts".&lt;ref name="Feige, Diana 1995 P109"&gt;Feige, Diana, and Franz G M. Feige. "Love, Marriage, and Family in Puritan Society." Dialogue &amp; Alliance 9, no. 1 (1 March 1995): 96–114. ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials, EBSCOhost (accessed 3 December 2010). P109&lt;/ref&gt; This is because they found no biblical precedent for clergy performing marriage ceremonies. Further, marriage was said to be for the "relief of [[concupiscence]]"&lt;ref name="Feige, Diana 1995 P109"/&gt; as well as any spiritual purpose.

During the [[Protestant Reformation]], [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] denied the [[Sacrament of marriage|sacramentality of marriage]]. This unanimity was broken at the [[Lambeth Conferences#Seventh: 1930|1930 Lambeth Conference]], the quadrennial meeting of the worldwide [[Anglican]] Communion—creating divisions in that denomination.

Sex before marriage was not a taboo in the Anglican Church until the "Hardwicke Marriage Act of 1753, which for the first time stipulated that everyone in England and Wales had to be married in their parish church"&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2296151.stm | work=BBC News | title=The no-sex 'myth' | date=3 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that time, "marriage began at the time of betrothal, when couples would live and sleep together... The process begun at the time of the Hardwicke Act continued throughout the 1800s, with stigma beginning to attach to illegitimacy."&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

Scriptures in the [[New Testament]] dealing with sexuality are extensive. Subjects include: the [[Apostolic Decree]] ({{bibleverse||Acts|15}}), sexual immorality, divine love ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|13|KJV}}), mutual self-giving ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|7|KJV}}), bodily membership between Christ and between husband and wife ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:15–20|KJV}}) and honor versus dishonor of adultery ({{bibleverse||Hebrews|13:4|KJV}}).

Social structures before and at the dawn of Christianity in the [[Roman Empire]] held that women were inferior to men intellectually and physically and were "naturally dependent".&lt;ref name="Noble, p.230"&gt;Noble, p.230&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athens, Greece|Athenian]] women were legally classified as children regardless of age and were the "legal property of some man at all stages in her life."&lt;ref name="Stark, p.104"&gt;Stark, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the Roman Empire had limited legal rights and could not enter professions. Female infanticide and abortion were practiced by all classes.&lt;ref name="Stark, p.104"/&gt; In family life, men could have "lovers, prostitutes and concubines" but wives who engaged in extramarital affairs were considered guilty of adultery. It was not rare for pagan women to be married before the age of puberty and then forced to consummate the marriage with her often much older husband. Husbands could divorce their wives at any time simply by telling the wife to leave; wives did not have a similar ability to divorce their husbands.&lt;ref name="Noble, p.230"/&gt;

Early Church Fathers advocated against polygamy, abortion, infanticide, child abuse, homosexuality, transvestism, and incest.&lt;ref name="witte20"/&gt; Although some Christian ideals were adopted by the Roman Empire, there is little evidence to link most of these laws to Church influence.&lt;ref name=nathan187&gt;Nathan (2002), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Roman Empire adopted Christianity as the official religion, however, the link between Christian teachings and Roman family laws became more clear.&lt;ref name=Nathan91&gt;Nathan (2002), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Church teaching heavily influenced the legal concept of marriage.&lt;ref name=power1and2&gt;Power (1995), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Gregorian Reform]], the Church developed and codified a view of marriage as a sacrament.&lt;ref name=witte23/&gt; In a departure from societal norms, Church law required the consent of both parties before a marriage could be performed&lt;ref name="witte20"/&gt; and established a minimum age for marriage.&lt;ref name=shahar33&gt;Shahar (2003), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The elevation of marriage to a sacrament also made the union a binding contract, with dissolutions overseen by Church authorities.&lt;ref name=witte29&gt;Witte (1997), p. 29, 36&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Church abandoned tradition to allow women the same rights as men to dissolve a marriage,&lt;ref&gt;Witte (1997), p. 20, 25&lt;/ref&gt; in practice, when an accusation of infidelity was made, men were granted dissolutions more frequently than women.&lt;ref name=shahar18&gt;Shahar (2003), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval period===
According to historian [[Shulamith Shahar]], "[s]ome historians hold that the Church played a considerable part in fostering the inferior status of women in medieval society in general" by providing a "moral justification" for male superiority and by accepting practices such as wife-beating.&lt;ref name=shahar88&gt;Shahar (2003), p. 88. "The ecclesiastical conception of the inferior status of women, deriving from Creation, her role in Original Sin and her subjugation to man, provided both direct and indirect justification for her inferior standing in the family and in society in medieval civilization. It was not the Church which induced husbands to beat their wives, but it not only accepted this custom after the event, if it was not carried to excess, but, by proclaiming the superiority of man, also supplied its moral justification."&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these laws, some women, particularly [[abbess]]es, gained powers that were never available to women in previous Roman or Germanic societies.&lt;ref name=shahar12&gt;Shahar (2003), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these teachings emboldened secular authorities to give women fewer rights than men, they also helped form the concept of [[chivalry]].&lt;ref&gt;Power (1995), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Chivalry was influenced by a new Church attitude towards Mary, the mother of Jesus.&lt;ref name=shahar25&gt;Shahar (2003), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This "ambivalence about women's very nature" was shared by most major religions in the Western world.&lt;ref name=bitel102&gt;Bitel (2002), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavery==
{{main|Catholic Church and slavery}}

The Church initially accepted slavery as part of the Greco-Roman social fabric of society, campaigning primarily for humane treatment of slaves but also admonishing slaves to behave appropriately towards their masters.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan (2002), pp. 171–173.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Glenn Sunshine says, "Christians were the first people in history to oppose slavery systematically. Early Christians purchased slaves in the markets simply to set them free.  Later, in the seventh century, the Franks..., under the influence of its Christian queen, [[Bathilde]], became the first kingdom in history to begin the process of outlawing slavery. ...In the 1200's, Thomas Aquinas declared slavery a sin. When the African slave trade began in the 1400's, it was condemned numerous times by the papacy."&lt;ref name="Glenn S. Sunshine"&gt;{{cite book| last=Sunshine| first = Glenn S.| title=Why You Think the Way You Do: The Story of Western Worldviews from Rome to Home| year=2009| publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan| isbn=978-0-310-29230-2| page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early medieval period, Christians tolerated enslavement of non-Christians. By the end of the Medieval period, enslavement of Christians had been mitigated somewhat with the spread of [[serfdom]] within Europe, though outright slavery existed in European colonies in other parts of the world. Several popes issued papal bulls condemning mistreatment of enslaved Native Americans; these were largely ignored. In his 1839 bull ''[[In supremo apostolatus]]'', Pope [[Gregory XVI]] condemned all forms of slavery; nevertheless some American bishops continued to support slavery for several decades.&lt;ref name=starkrodney&gt;Stark, Rodney (1 July 2003). "The Truth About the Catholic Church and Slavery". ''Christianity Today''.&lt;/ref&gt; In this historic Bull, Pope Gregory outlined his summation of the impact of the Church on the ancient institution of slavery, beginning by acknowledging that early Apostles had tolerated slavery but had called on masters to "act well towards their slaves... knowing that the common Master both of themselves and of the slaves is in Heaven, and that with Him there is no distinction of persons". Gregory continued to discuss the involvement of Christians for and against slavery through the ages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Greg16/g16sup.htm|title=IN SUPREMO APOSTOLATUS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|In the process of time, the fog of pagan superstition being more completely dissipated and the manners of barbarous people having been softened, thanks to Faith operating by Charity, it at last comes about that, since several centuries, there are no more slaves in the greater number of Christian nations. But – We say with profound sorrow – there were to be found afterwards among the Faithful men who, shamefully blinded by the desire of sordid gain, in lonely and distant countries, did not hesitate to reduce to slavery Indians, negroes and other wretched peoples, or else, by instituting or developing the trade in those who had been made slaves by others, to favour their unworthy practice. Certainly many Roman Pontiffs of glorious memory, Our Predecessors, did not fail, according to the duties of their charge, to blame severely this way of acting as dangerous for the spiritual welfare of those engaged in the traffic and a shame to the Christian name; they foresaw that as a result of this, the infidel peoples would be more and more strengthened in their hatred of the true Religion.}}

===Latin America===
[[File:StPeterClaver.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint [[Peter Claver]] worked for the alleviation of the suffering of African slaves brought to South America.]]

It was women, primarily Amerindian Christian converts who became the primary supporters of the Latin American Church.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; While the Spanish military was known for its ill-treatment of Amerindian men and women, Catholic missionaries are credited with championing all efforts to initiate protective laws for the Indians and fought against their enslavement. This began within 20 years of the discovery of the New World by Europeans in 1492 – in December 1511, [[Antonio de Montesinos (Dominican friar)|Antonio de Montesinos]], a Dominican friar, openly rebuked the Spanish rulers of [[Hispaniola]] for their "cruelty and tyranny" in dealing with the American natives.&lt;ref name="Woods135"&gt;Woods, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] enacted the ''[[Laws of Burgos]]'' and ''Valladolid'' in response. The issue resulted in a crisis of conscience in 16th-century Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Johansen, p. 109, 110, quote: "In the Americas, the Catholic priest Bartolome de las Casas avidly encouraged enquiries into the Spanish conquest's many cruelties. Las Casas chronicled Spanish brutality against the Native peoples in excruciating detail."&lt;/ref&gt;  Further abuses against the Amerindians committed by Spanish authorities were denounced by Catholic missionaries such as [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]] and [[Francisco de Vitoria]] which led to debate on the nature of human rights&lt;ref&gt;Koschorke, p.287&lt;/ref&gt; and the birth of modern international law.&lt;ref name="Woods137"&gt;Woods, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Enforcement of these laws was lax, and some historians blame the Church for not doing enough to liberate the Indians; others point to the Church as the only voice raised on behalf of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="Dussel45"&gt;Dussel, p. 45, 52, 53 quote: "The missionary Church opposed this state of affairs from the beginning, and nearly everything positive that was done for the benefit of the indigenous peoples resulted from the call and clamor of the missionaries. The fact remained, however, that widespread injustice was extremely difficult to uproot ... Even more important than Bartolome de Las Casas was the Bishop of Nicaragua, Antonio de Valdeviso, who ultimately suffered martyrdom for his defense of the Indian."&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery and human sacrifice were both part of Latin American culture before the Europeans arrived. Indian slavery was first abolished by [[Pope Paul III]] in the 1537 bull [[Sublimis Deus]] which confirmed that "their souls were as immortal as those of Europeans" and they should neither be robbed nor turned into slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Johansen, p. 110, quote: "In the Papal bull ''Sublimis deus'' (1537), Pope Paul III declared that Indians were to be regarded as fully human, and that their souls were as immortal as those of Europeans. This edict also outlawed slavery of Indians in any form&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt;  While these edicts may have had some beneficial effects, these were limited in scope. European colonies were mainly run by military and royally-appointed administrators, who [[Spanish colonization of the Americas#Indigenous peoples (Native Americans)|seldom stopped to consider church teachings]] when forming policy or enforcing their rule. Even after [[Spanish American wars of independence|independence]], institutionalized prejudice and injustice toward indigenous people continued well into the twentieth century. This has led to the formation of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#Rise of indigenous movements|a number of movements to reassert]] indigenous peoples' civil rights and culture in modern nation-states.

A catastrophe was wrought upon the Amerindians by contact with Europeans. Old World diseases like smallpox, measles, malaria and many others spread through Indian populations. "In most of the New World 90 percent or more of the native population was destroyed by wave after wave of previously unknown afflictions. Explorers and colonists did not enter an empty land but rather an emptied one".&lt;ref name="Noble454"&gt;Noble, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
Slavery and the [[slave trade]] were part of African societies and states which supplied the Arab world with slaves before the arrival of the Europeans.&lt;ref name="Ferro221"&gt;Ferro, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Several decades prior to discovery of the [[New World]], in response to serious military threat to Europe posed by Muslims of the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Pope Nicholas V]] had granted Portugal the right to subdue Muslims, pagans and other unbelievers in the papal bull [[Dum Diversas]] (1452).&lt;ref name="Thomas66"&gt;Thomas, p. 65-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Six years after African slavery was first outlawed by the first major entity to do so, (Great Britain in 1833), [[Pope Gregory XVI]] followed in a challenge to Spanish and Portuguese policy, by condemning slavery and the slave trade in the 1839 papal bull ''[[In supremo apostolatus]]'', and approved the ordination of native clergy in the face of government racism.&lt;ref name="Duffy221"&gt;Duffy, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States would eventually outlaw African slavery in 1865.

By the close of the 19th century, European powers had managed to gain control of most of the African interior.&lt;ref name="Has398"/&gt; The new rulers introduced cash-based economies which created an enormous demand for literacy and a western education—a demand which for most Africans could only be satisfied by Christian missionaries.&lt;ref name="Has398"/&gt; Catholic missionaries followed colonial governments into Africa, and built schools, hospitals, monasteries and churches.&lt;ref name="Has398"&gt;Hastings, p. 397–410.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Letters and learning==

The influence of the Church on Western letters and learning has been formidable. The ancient texts of the Bible have deeply influenced Western art, literature and culture. For centuries following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, small monastic communities were practically the only outposts of literacy in Western Europe. In time, the Cathedral schools developed into Europe's earliest universities and the church has established thousands of primary, secondary and tertiary institutions throughout the world in the centuries since. The Church and clergymen have also sought at different times to censor texts and scholars. Thus different schools of opinion exist as to the role and influence of the Church in relation to western letters and learning.

One view, first propounded by [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment philosophers]], asserts that the Church's doctrines are entirely superstitious and have hindered the progress of civilization. [[Communist states]] have made similar arguments in their education in order to inculcate a negative view of Catholicism (and religion in general) in their citizens. The most famous incidents cited by such critics are the Church's condemnations of the teachings of [[Copernicus]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Johannes Kepler]].
[[File:Active Christians in Science.jpg|thumb|200px|Set of pictures for a number of notable Scientists self-identified as Christians: [[Isaac Newton]], [[Robert Boyle]], [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Johannes Kepler]].]]
In opposition to this view, some historians of science, including non-Catholics such as [[J.L. Heilbron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=J.L. Heilbron|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/contribhome.php?get=heil01 |publisher=London Review of Books |accessdate=15 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alistair Cameron Crombie|A.C. Crombie]], [[David C.

They hold that, not only did monks save and cultivate the remnants of ancient civilization during the barbarian invasions, but that the Church promoted learning and science through its sponsorship of many [[medieval university|universities]] which, under its leadership, grew rapidly in Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries. Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, and Johannes Kepler all considered themselves Christian. St.[[Thomas Aquinas]], the Church's "model theologian," argued that reason is in harmony with faith, and that reason can contribute to a deeper understanding of revelation, and so encouraged intellectual development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Fides et Ratio'' (Faith and Reason), IV|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/JP2FIDES.HTM#Ch4b |author=Pope John Paul II |date=September 1998 |accessdate=15 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church's priest-scientists, many of whom were [[Jesuit]]s, have been among the leading lights in [[astronomy]], [[genetics]], [[geomagnetism]], [[meteorology]], [[seismology]], and [[solar physics]], becoming some of the "fathers" of these sciences. Examples include important churchmen such as the [[Augustinian]] abbot [[Gregor Mendel]] (pioneer in the study of genetics), the monk [[William of Ockham]] who developed [[Ockham's Razor]], [[Roger Bacon]] (a [[Franciscan]] friar who was one of the early advocates of the [[scientific method]]), and Belgian priest [[Georges Lemaître]] (the first to propose the [[Big Bang]] theory). Other notable priest scientists have included [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Nicholas Steno]], [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi]], [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli|Giambattista Riccioli]], [[Roger Boscovich]], and [[Athanasius Kircher]]. Even more numerous are Catholic laity involved in science:[[Henri Becquerel]] who discovered [[radioactivity]]; [[Galvani]], [[Alessandro Volta|Volta]], [[Ampere]], [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]], pioneers in electricity and [[telecommunications]]; [[Lavoisier]], "father of modern [[chemistry]]"; [[Vesalius]], founder of modern [[human anatomy]]; and [[Cauchy]], one of the mathematicians who laid the rigorous foundations of [[calculus]].

Many well-known historical figures who influenced Western science considered themselves Christian such as [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]],&lt;ref&gt;''Pro forma'' candidate to Prince-Bishop of Warmia, cf. Dobrzycki, Jerzy, and Leszek Hajdukiewicz, "Kopernik, Mikołaj", ''[[Polski słownik biograficzny]]'' (Polish Biographical Dictionary), vol.

===Antiquity===
[[File:Codex binding Louvre MR373.jpg|thumb|upright|David dictating the [[Psalms]], book cover. Ivory, end of the 10th century–11th century.]]

Christianity began as a Jewish sect in the 1st century AD, and from the teachings of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] and his early followers. Jesus learned the texts of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and became an influential wandering preacher. Accounts of his life and teachings appear in the [[New Testament view on Jesus' life|New Testament]] of the Bible, one of the bedrock texts of Western Civilisation.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; His orations, including the  ''[[Sermon on the Mount]]'', ''[[Parable of the Good Samaritan|The Good Samaritan]]'' and his declaration against hypocrisy "[[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|Let he who is without sin cast the first stone]]" have been deeply influential in [[Western literature]]. Many translations of the Bible exist, including the [[King James Bible]], which is one of the most admired texts in [[English literature]]. The poetic [[Psalms]] and other passages of the Hebrew Bible have also been deeply influential in Western Literature and thought. Accounts of the actions of Jesus' early followers are contained within the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and [[Epistle]]s written between the early Christian communities – in particular the [[Pauline epistles]] which are among the earliest extant Christian documents and foundational texts of [[Christian theology]].

After the death of Jesus, the new sect grew to be the dominant religion of the Roman Empire and the long tradition of Christian scholarship began. When the [[Western Roman Empire]] was starting to disintegrate, [[St Augustine]] was Bishop of [[Hippo Regius]].&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8787/ |title = Bona, Algeria |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1899 |accessdate = 2013-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Latin]]-speaking philosopher and theologian who lived in the Roman [[Africa Province]]. His writings were very influential in the development of [[Western Christianity]] and he developed the concept of the Church as a spiritual [[New Jerusalem#Christianity|City of God]] (in [[City of God (book)|a book of the same name]]), distinct from the material Earthly City.&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;{{cite book | last = Durant | first = Will | title = Caesar and Christ: a History of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] Civilization and of Christianity from Their Beginnings to A.D. 325 | publisher = MJF Books | location = New York| year = 1992 | isbn = 1-56731-014-1 |authorlink=Will Durant}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book [[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]], which outlines his sinful youth and conversion to Christianity, is widely considered to be the first autobiography of ever written in the canon of [[Western Literature]].

=== Byzantine Empire ===

The influence of Archimedes' principles of solid geometry is evident.]]

The writings of [[Classical antiquity]] never ceased to be cultivated in Byzantium. Therefore, Byzantine science was in every period closely connected with [[ancient philosophy]], and [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anastos|1962|p=409}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of engineering [[Isidore of Miletus]], the Greek mathematician and architect of the [[Hagia Sophia]], produced the first compilation of [[Archimedes]] works c. 530, and it is through this tradition, kept alive by the school of mathematics and engineering founded c. 850 during the "Byzantine Renaissance" by [[Leo the Geometer]] that such works are known today (see [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]).&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Jones, [http://www.ams.org/notices/200505/rev-jones.pdf "Book Review, Archimedes Manuscript"] American Mathematical Society, May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, geometry and its applications (architecture and engineering instruments of war) remained a specialty of the Byzantines.[[File:ViennaDioscoridesFolio3v7Physicians.jpg|thumb|120px|left|The frontispiece of the [[Vienna Dioscurides]], which shows a set of seven famous physicians ]] Though scholarship lagged during the dark years following the Arab conquests, during the so-called ''Byzantine Renaissance'' at the end of the first millennium Byzantine scholars re-asserted themselves becoming experts in the scientific developments of the Arabs and Persians, particularly in [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1991|pp=116–118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantines are also credited with [[List of Byzantine inventions|several technological advancements]], particularly in architecture (e.g. the pendentive dome) and warfare technology (e.g. [[Greek fire]]).

Although at various times the Byzantines made magnificent achievements in the application of the [[Science in the Middle Ages|sciences]] (notably in the construction of the [[Hagia Sophia]]), and although they preserved much of the ancient knowledge of science and geometry, after the 6th century Byzantine scholars made few novel contributions to science in terms of developing new theories or extending the ideas of classical authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|1994|p=395}}; Dickson, [http://www.roma.unisa.edu.au/07305/medmm.htm Mathematics Through the Middle Ages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513152720/http://www.roma.unisa.edu.au/07305/medmm.htm |date=13 May 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final century of the Empire, Byzantine grammarians were those principally responsible for carrying, in person and in writing, ancient Greek grammatical and literary studies to early [[Renaissance Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robins|1993|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, [[astronomy]] and other [[mathematics|mathematical sciences]] were taught in Trebizond; medicine attracted the interest of almost all scholars.&lt;ref name="TM189"&gt;{{harvnb|Tatakes|Moutafakis|2003|p=189}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of law, [[Justinian I]]'s reforms had a clear effect on the evolution of [[jurisprudence]], and Leo III's ''Ecloga'' influenced the formation of legal institutions in the Slavic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Troianos|Velissaropoulou-Karakosta|1997|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 10th century, [[Leo VI the Wise]] achieved the complete codification of the whole of Byzantine law in Greek, which became the foundation of all subsequent Byzantine law, generating interest to the present day.

===Preservation of Classical learning===
[[File:KellsFol032vChristEnthroned.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Book of Kells]]. Celtic Church scholars did much to preserve the texts of ancient Europe through the Dark Ages.]]

During the period of European history often called the ''[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]'' which followed the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]], Church scholars and missionaries played a vital role in preserving knowledge of Classical Learning. While the Roman Empire and Christian religion survived in an increasingly Hellenised form in the [[Byzantine Empire]] centred at Constantinople in the East, Western civilisation suffered a collapse of literacy and organisation following the fall of Rome in 476AD. Monks sought refuge at the far fringes of the known world: like Cornwall, Ireland, or the Hebrides. Disciplined Christian scholarship carried on in isolated outposts like [[Skellig Michael]] in Ireland, where literate monks became some of the last preservers in Western Europe of the poetic and philosophical works of Western antiquity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Kenneth Clark; Civilisation, BBC, SBN 563 10279 9; first published 1969&lt;/ref&gt; By around 800AD they were producing illuminated manuscripts such as the [[Book of Kells]], by which old learning was re-communicated to Western Europe. The [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]] led by Irish and Scottish monks like St [[Columba]] spread Christianity back into Western Europe during the Middle Ages, establishing monasteries through Anglo-Saxon England and the Frankish Empire during the Middle Ages.

[[Thomas Cahill]], in his 1995 book ''[[How the Irish Saved Civilization]]'', credited Irish Monks with having "saved" Western Civilization:&lt;ref&gt;''How The Irish Saved Civilization: The Untold Story of Ireland's Heroic Role from the Fall of Rome to the Rise of Medieval Europe'' by [[Thomas Cahill]], 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Mission of the Irish Monks]], who single-handedly re-founded European civilization throughout the continent in the bays and valleys of their exile, the world that came after them would have been an entirely different one-a world without books. And our own world would never have come to be.}}

According to art historian [[Kenneth Clark]], for some five centuries after the fall of Rome, virtually all men of intellect joined the Church and practically nobody in western Europe outside of monastic settlements had the ability to read or write. While church scholars at different times also destroyed classical texts they felt were contrary to the Christian message, it was they, virtually alone in Western Europe, who preserved texts from the old society.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

As Western Europe became more orderly again, the Church remained a driving force in education, setting up [[Cathedral schools]] beginning in the Early Middle Ages as centers of education, which became [[medieval universities]], the springboard of many of Western Europe's later achievements.

===Index Librorum Prohibitorum===
[[File:Index Librorum Prohibitorum 1.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' (Venice 1564).]]
The [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] ("List of Prohibited Books") was a list of publications [[censorship|prohibited]] by the [[Catholic Church]]. The promulgation of the ''Index'' marked the "''turning-point in the freedom of enquiry''" in the Catholic world.&lt;ref&gt;Charles B. Schmitt, ''et al.'' ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991), "Printing and censorship after 1550", p.45ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Index was published in 1559 by the Sacred Congregation of the Roman Inquisition. The last edition of the Index appeared in 1948 and publication of the list ceased 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/285220/Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum|title=Index Librorum Prohibitorum|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The avowed aim of the list was to protect the faith and morals of the faithful by preventing the reading of [[morality|immoral]] books or works containing [[theology|theological]] errors. Books thought to contain such errors included some scientific works by leading astronomers such as [[Johannes Kepler]]'s ''Epitome astronomiae Copernicianae'', which was on the Index from 1621 to 1835. The various editions of the Index also contained the rules of the Church relating to the reading, selling and pre-emptive censorship of books.

Canon law still recommends that works concerning sacred Scripture, theology, canon law, church history, and any writings which specially concern religion or good morals, be submitted to the judgement of the local [[Ordinary (officer)|Ordinary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2P.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law: text – IntraText CT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the scientific works that were on early editions of the Index (e.g. on [[heliocentrism]]) have long been routinely taught at Catholic universities worldwide. [[Giordano Bruno]], whose works were on the Index, now has a monument in Rome, [[Giordano Bruno#Retrospective views of Bruno|erected over the Church's objections]] at the place where he was [[Death by burning|burned alive at the stake]] for [[heresy]].

=== Protestant role in science ===
According to the [[Merton Thesis]] there was a positive [[correlation]] between the rise of [[puritanism]] and [[protestant]] [[pietism]] on the one hand and early [[experimental science]] on the other.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003&gt;[[Piotr Sztompka|Sztompka, Piotr]] (2003), ''Robert King Merton'', in ''[[George Ritzer|Ritzer, George]], [[The Blackwell Companion to Major Contemporary Social Theorists]], Malden, Massachusetts Oxford: Blackwell, p. 13, {{ISBN|9781405105958}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Merton Thesis has two separate parts: Firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental techniques and [[methodology]]; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century England and the religious [[demography]] of the [[Royal Society]] (English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants) can be explained by a [[correlation]] between Protestantism and the scientific values.&lt;ref name=gregory1998&gt;Gregory, Andrew (1998), Handout for course 'The Scientific Revolution' at The Scientific Revolution&lt;/ref&gt; In his theory, [[Robert K. Merton]] focused on English Puritanism and [[Spener|German Pietism]] as having been responsible for the development of the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th and 18th centuries. Merton explained that the connection between [[religious affiliation]] and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the [[ascetic]] Protestant values and those of modern science.&lt;ref name=becker1992&gt;Becker, George (1992), ''The Merton Thesis: Oetinger and German Pietism, a significant negative case,'' [[Sociological Forum]] (Springer) 7 (4), pp. 642–660&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to study God's influence on the world and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003/&gt;

===Astronomy===
[[File:Specola1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vatican Observatory]] Telescope in [[Castel Gandolfo]].]]

Historically, the Catholic Church has been a major a sponsor of astronomy, not least due to the astronomical basis of the calendar by which holy days and Easter are determined. Nevertheless, the most famous case of a scientist being tried for heresy arose in this field of science: the [[trial of Galileo]].

The Church's interest in astronomy began with purely practical concerns, when in the 16th century Pope Gregory XIII required astronomers to correct for the fact that the [[Julian calendar]] had fallen out of sync with the sky. Since the [[Spring equinox]] was tied to the celebration of Easter, the Church considered that this steady movement in the date of the equinox was undesirable. The resulting [[Gregorian calendar]] is the internationally accepted [[civil calendar]] used throughout the world today and is an important contribution of the Catholic Church to Western Civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/astronomical-information-center/calendars Introduction to Calendars]. [[United States Naval Observatory]].

[[File:Galileo facing the Roman Inquisition.jpg|thumb|250px|''Galileo facing the Roman Inquisition'' by [[Cristiano Banti]] (1857).]]

The famous astronomers [[Nicholas Copernicus]], who put the sun at the centre of the heavens in 1543, and [[Galileo Galilei]], who experimented with the new technology of the [[telescope]] and, with its aid declared his belief that Copernicus was correct – were both practising Catholics – indeed Copernicus was a catholic clergyman. Yet the church establishment at that time held to theories devised in pre-Christian Greece by [[Ptolemy]] and [[Aristotle]], which said that the sky revolved around the earth. When Galileo began to assert that the earth in fact revolved around the sun, he therefore found himself challenging the Church establishment at a time where the Church hierarchy also held temporal power and was engaged in the ongoing political challenge of the rise of Protestantism. After discussions with [[Pope Urban VIII]] (a man who had written admiringly of Galileo before taking papal office), Galileo believed he could avoid censure by presenting his arguments in dialogue form – but the Pope took offence when he discovered that some of his own words were being spoken by a character in the book who was a simpleton and Galileo was called for a trial before the Inquisition.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[[Jacob Bronowski]]; ''The Ascent of Man''; Angus &amp; Robertson, 1973 {{ISBN|0-563-17064-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this most famous example cited by critics of the Catholic Church's "posture towards science", [[Galileo Galilei]] [[Galileo affair|was denounced]] in 1633 for his work on the [[heliocentric]] model of the solar system, previously proposed by the Polish clergyman and intellectual Nicolaus Copernicus. Copernicus's work had been [[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium#Reception|suppressed de facto]] by the Church, but Catholic authorities were generally tolerant of discussion of the hypothesis as long as it was portrayed only as a useful mathematical fiction, and not descriptive of reality. Galileo, by contrast, argued from his unprecedented observations of the solar system that the heliocentric system was not merely an abstract model for calculating planetary motions, but actually corresponded to physical reality – that is, he insisted the planets really do orbit the Sun. After years of telescopic observation, consultations with the Popes, and verbal and written discussions with astronomers and clerics, a trial was convened by the [[Roman Inquisition|Tribunal of the Roman and Universal Inquisition]]. Galileo was found "vehemently suspect of heresy" (not "guilty of heresy," as is frequently misreported), placed under [[house arrest]], and all of his works, including any future writings, were banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|_note-publication-ban}}[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p.367)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p.184)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=209 (1905, 16:209,] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=230 230)]{{it icon}}. When Fulgenzio Micanzio, one of Galileo's friends in Venice, sought to have Galileo's ''Discourse on Floating Bodies'' reprinted in 1635, he was informed by the Venetian Inquisitor that the Inquisition had forbidden further publication of any of Galileo's works [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|(Favaro]], [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=209 1905, 16:209)]{{it icon}}, and was later shown a copy of the order [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|(Favaro]],[http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=230 1905, 16:230)].{{it icon}} When the Dutch publishers [[House of Elzevir|Elzevir]] published Galileo's ''Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences'' in 1638, some five years after his trial, they did so under the pretense that a manuscript he had presented to the French Ambassador to Rome for preservation and circulation to interested intellectuals had been used without his knowledge ([[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt, 1994, p.184;]] [[#Reference-Galileo-1954|Galilei, 1954]] [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=753&amp;chapter=109888&amp;layout=html p.xvii]; [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]], [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=8&amp;VOLPAG=43 1898, 8:43] {{it icon}}).

{{cquote|The effect of the trial and imprisonment was to put a total stop to the scientific tradition in the Mediterranean. From now on the Scientific Revolution moved to Northern Europe.}}

===Evolution===
{{Main|Evolution and the Catholic Church}}

Since the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, the position of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] on the theory of [[evolution]] has slowly been refined. For about 100 years, there was no authoritative pronouncement on the subject, though many hostile comments were made by local church figures. In contrast with many Protestant objections, Catholic issues with evolutionary theory have had little to do with maintaining the literalism of the account in the [[Book of Genesis]], and have always been concerned with the question of how man came to have a soul. Modern [[Creationism]] has had little Catholic support. In the 1950s, the Church's position was one of neutrality; by the late 20th century its position evolved to one of general acceptance in recent years. However, the church insists that the human soul was immediately infused by God, and the reality of a single ancestor (commonly called [[monogenism]]) for the human race.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

{{As of|2008|alt=Today}}, the Church's official position is a fairly non-specific example of ''[[theistic evolution]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.com/library/adam_eve_and_evolution.asp |title=Adam, Eve, and Evolution |accessdate=10 October 2007 |author=Catholic Answers (Imprimatur Robert H.

No infallible declarations by the Pope or an [[Ecumenical Council]] have been made. The Catholic Church's official position is fairly non-specific, stating only that faith and the origin of man's material body "from pre-existing living matter" are not in conflict, and that the existence of God is required to explain the spiritual component of man's origin.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Many [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christians]], however, retain the belief that the Biblical account of the creation of the world (as opposed to evolution) is literal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Pamela |last=Gentry |date=17 April 2015 |title=5 Beliefs That Set Fundamentalist Christians Apart From Other Denominations |publisher=NewsMax |url=http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/fundamentalist-christians-denominations/2015/04/17/id/639249/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embryonic stem cell research===
Recently, the Church has been criticized for its teaching that [[embryonic stem cell research]] is a form of [[Human subject research|experimentation on human beings]], and results in the killing of a human person. Much criticism of this position has been on the grounds that the doctrine hinders scientific research; even some conservatives, taking a [[utilitarian]] position, [[Stem cell controversy#Viewpoints|have pointed out]] that most embryos from which stem cells are harvested are "leftover" from [[in vitro fertilization]], and would soon be discarded whether used for such research or not.  The Church, by contrast, has consistently upheld its ideal of the dignity of each individual human life, and argues that it is as wrong to destroy an embryo as it would be to kill an adult human being; and that therefore advances in medicine can and must come without the destruction of human embryos, for example by using adult or umbilical stem cells in place of embryonic stem cells.

Many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] states in Eastern Europe, as well as to some degree the [[Muslim world|Muslim]] states of the eastern [[Mediterranean]], preserved many aspects of the empire's culture and art for centuries afterward. A number of states contemporary with the [[Byzantine Empire]] were culturally influenced by it, without actually being part of it (the "[[Byzantine commonwealth]]"). These included [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[History of Medieval Serbia|Serbia]], and the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]], as well as some non-Orthodox states like the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire despite being in other respects part of western European culture. Art produced by Eastern Orthodox Christians living in the [[Ottoman Empire]] is often called "post-Byzantine." Certain artistic traditions that originated in the Byzantine Empire, particularly in regard to icon painting and church architecture, are maintained in Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Russia and other Eastern Orthodox countries to the present day.

Several historians credit the Catholic Church for what they consider to be the brilliance and magnificence of Western art. "Even though the church dominated art and architecture, it did not prevent architects and artists from experimenting..."&lt;ref name="Roy T. Matthews"/&gt;{{rp|225}} Historians refer to the western Church's consistent opposition to [[Byzantine iconoclasm]], a movement against visual representations of the divine, and its insistence on building structures befitting worship. Important contributions include its cultivation and patronage of individual artists, as well as development of the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]], [[Gothic art|Gothic]] and [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] styles of art and architecture.&lt;ref name="Woods122"&gt;Woods, pp. 115–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Renaissance artists such as [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Caravaggio]], and [[Titian]], were among a multitude of innovative virtuosos sponsored by the Church.&lt;ref name="Duffy133"&gt;Duffy, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s repeated reference to {{bibleverse||Wisdom|11:20}} (God "ordered all things by measure and number and weight") influenced the geometric constructions of Gothic architecture,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} the [[scholastics]]' intellectual systems called the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' which influenced the writings of [[Dante]], its creation and sacramental theology which has developed a [[Catholic imagination]] influencing writers such as [[J.

British art historian [[Kenneth Clark]] wrote that Western Europe's first "great age of civilisation" was ready to begin around the year 1000. From 1100, he wrote, monumental abbeys and cathedrals were constructed and decorated with sculptures, hangings, mosaics and works belonging one of the greatest epochs of art and providing stark contrast to the monotonous and cramped conditions of ordinary living during the period. [[Abbot Suger]] of the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St. Denis]] is considered an influential early patron of Gothic architecture and believed that love of beauty brought people closer to God: "The dull mind rises to truth through that which is material". Clarke calls this "the intellectual background of all the sublime works of art of the next century and in fact has remained the basis of our belief of the value of art until today".&lt;ref name="Civilisation, BBC 1969"/&gt;

Later, during [[The Renaissance]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], Catholic artists produced many of the unsurpassed masterpieces of [[Western art]] – often inspired by Biblical themes: from Michelangelo's ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' and ''[[Pietà]]'' sculptures, to Da Vinci's ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'' and Raphael's various ''Madonna'' paintings. Referring to a "great outburst of creative energy such as took place in Rome between 1620 and 1660", Kenneth Clarke wrote:&lt;ref name="Civilisation, BBC 1969"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]ith a single exception, the great artists of the time were all sincere, conforming Christians. [[Guercino]] spent much of his mornings in prayer; [[Bernini]] frequently went into retreats and practised the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]] of [[Ignatius of Loyola|Saint Ignatius]]; [[Rubens]] attended Mass every morning before beginning work. The exception was [[Caravaggio]], who was like the hero of a modern play, except that he happened to paint very well.

This conformism was not based on fear of the Inquisition, but on the perfectly simple belief that the faith which had inspired the great saints of the preceding generation was something by which a man should regulate his life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In music, Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern Western musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,&lt;ref name="Hall100"&gt;Hall, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The [[Baroque]] style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.&lt;ref name="Murray45"&gt;Murray, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of Catholic composers and Catholic sacred music which have a prominent place in Western culture is extensive, but includes [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''[[Ode to Joy]]''; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[Ave Verum Corpus]]''; [[Franz Schubert]]'s ''[[Ave Maria]]'', [[César Franck]]'s ''[[Panis angelicus]]'', and [[Antonio Vivaldi]]'s ''[[Gloria (Vivaldi)|Gloria]]''.

Similarly, the list of Catholic authors and literary works is vast. With a literary tradition spanning two millennia, the Bible and [[Papal Encyclicals]] have been constants of the Catholic canon but countless other historical works may be listed as noteworthy in terms of their influence on Western society. From late Antiquity, [[St Augustine]]'s book [[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]], which outlines his sinful youth and conversion to Christianity, is widely considered to be the first autobiography ever written in the canon of [[Western Literature]]. Augustine profoundly influenced the coming medieval worldview.&lt;ref name="Wilken 2003 291"/&gt; The [[Summa Theologica]], written 1265–1274, is the best-known work of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (c.1225–1274), and although unfinished, "one of the classics of the history of philosophy and one of the most influential works of Western literature."&lt;ref&gt;Ross, James F., "Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa theologiae'' (ca. 1273), Christian Wisdom Explained Philosophically", in ''The Classics of Western Philosophy: A Reader's Guide'', (eds.) Jorge J. E. Gracia, Gregory M. Reichberg, Bernard N. Schumacher (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2003), p. 165. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6jAcwGItzssC&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;ots=MXldxkl9sr&amp;dq=james%20f%20ross%20philosopher&amp;pg=PA165#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended as a manual for beginners in theology and a compendium of all of the main [[theology|theological]] teachings of the Church. It presents the reasoning for almost all points of Christian theology in the West. The epic poetry of the Italian [[Dante]] and his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' of the late [[Middle Ages]] is also considered immensely influential. The English statesman and philosopher, [[Thomas More]], wrote the seminal work [[Utopia (book)|Utopia]] in 1516. [[St Ignatius Loyola]], a key figure in the Catholic counter-reformation, is the author of an influential book of meditations known as the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]].

In [[Catholicism]], "[[Doctor of the Church]]" is a name is given to a saint from whose writings the whole Church is held to have derived great advantage and to whom "eminent learning" and "great sanctity" have been attributed by a proclamation of a pope or of an [[ecumenical council]]. This honour is given rarely, and only after [[canonization]].

The arts have been strongly inspired by Protestant beliefs. [[Martin Luther]], [[Paul Gerhardt]], [[George Wither]], [[Isaac Watts]], [[Charles Wesley]], [[William Cowper]], and many other authors and composers created well-known church hymns. Musicians like [[Heinrich Schütz]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[George Frederick Handel]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Johannes Brahms]], and [[Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy]] composed great works of music. Prominent painters with Protestant background were, for example, [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Rembrandt]], and [[Vincent van Gogh]]. World literature was enriched by the works of [[Edmund Spenser]], [[John Milton]], [[John Bunyan]], [[John Donne]], [[John Dryden]], [[Daniel Defoe]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Conrad Ferdinand Meyer]], [[Theodor Fontane]], [[Washington Irving]], [[Robert Browning]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Emily Brontë]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Thomas Stearns Eliot]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[William Faulkner]], [[John Updike]], and many others.

==Economic development==
[[Francisco de Vitoria]], a disciple of [[Thomas Aquinas]] and a Catholic thinker who studied the issue regarding the human rights of colonized natives, is recognized by the United Nations as a father of international law, and now also by historians of economics and democracy as a leading light for the West's democracy and rapid economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Philosophical and Historical Analysis of Modern Democracy, Equality, and Freedom Under the Influence of Christianity |url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/politics/pg0010.html |last=de Torre |first=Fr. Joseph M. |year=1997 |publisher=Catholic Education Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Schumpeter]], an economist of the twentieth century, referring to the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]], wrote, "it is they who come nearer than does any other group to having been the 'founders' of scientific economics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of Economic Analysis |last=Schumpeter |first=Joseph |year=1954 |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other economists and historians, such as Raymond de Roover, Marjorie Grice-Hutchinson, and Alejandro Chafuen, have also made similar statements. Historian Paul Legutko of Stanford University said the Catholic Church is "at the center of the development of the values, ideas, science, laws, and institutions which constitute what we call Western civilization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Review of ''How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization'' by Thomas Woods, Jr. |url=http://www.nrbookservice.com/products/bookpage.asp?prod_cd=c6664 |work=National Review Book Service |accessdate=16 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protestant work ethic ===
{{Main|Protestant work ethic}}
The Protestant concept of God and man allows believers to use all their God-given faculties, including the power of reason. That means that they are allowed to explore God's creation and, according to Genesis 2:15, make use of it in a responsible and sustainable way. Thus a cultural climate was created that greatly enhanced the development of the [[humanities]] and the [[sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerhard Lenski]] (1963), ''The Religious Factor: A Sociological Study of Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics, and Family Life'', Revised Edition,  A Doubleday Anchor Book, Garden City, N.Y., pp.348–351&lt;/ref&gt; Another consequence of the Protestant understanding of man is that the believers, in gratitude for their election and redemption in Christ, are to follow God's commandments. Industry, frugality, calling, discipline, and a strong sense of responsibility are at the heart of their moral code.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005), ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763–1789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-516247-9}}, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Weerda, ''Soziallehre des Calvinismus'', in ''Evangelisches Soziallexikon'', 3.

Therefore, craftsmen, industrialists, and other businessmen were able to reinvest the greater part of their profits in the most efficient machinery and the most modern production methods that were based on progress in the sciences and technology. As a result, productivity grew, which led to increased profits and enabled employers to pay higher wages. In this way, the economy, the sciences, and technology reinforced each other. The chance to participate in the economic success of technological inventions was a strong incentive to both inventors and investors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eduard Heimann]], ''Kapitalismus'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3.

==Social justice, care-giving, and the hospital system==
{{Main|Catholic social teaching}}
[[File:Physician in hospital sickroom printed 1682.jpg|thumb|upright|Historian of hospitals, [[Guenter Risse]], says that the Church spearheaded the development of a hospital system geared towards the marginalized.]]
The Catholic Church has contributed to society through its social doctrine which has guided leaders to promote social justice and providing care to the sick and poor. In orations such as his ''[[Sermon on the Mount]]'' and stories such as ''[[Parable of the Good Samaritan|The Good Samaritan]]'', Jesus called on followers to worship God, act without violence or prejudice and care for the sick, hungry and poor. Such teachings are the foundation of Catholic Church involvement in [[social justice]], hospitals and health care.

===Fourth Century===
Historians record that, prior to Christianity, the ancient world left little trace of any organized charitable effort.&lt;ref name="Gerhard Uhlhorn"&gt;{{cite book| last=Ulhorn| first=Gerhard| title=Christian Charity in the Ancient Church|year=1883| publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|pages=2–44,321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian charity and the practice of feeding and clothing the poor, visiting prisoners, supporting widows and orphan children has had sweeping impact.&lt;ref name="Charles Schmidt"&gt;{{cite book| last=Schmidt| first=Charles|title=The Social Results of Early Christianity|year=1889| publisher=William Isbister Ltd.|location=London, England| pages=245–256| chapter=Chapter Five: The Poor and Unfortunate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert Jonsen, University of Washington historian of medicine, says “the second great sweep of medical history begins at the end of the fourth century, with the founding of the first Christian hospital at Caesarea in Cappadocia, and concludes at the end of the fourteenth century, with medicine well ensconced in the universities and in the public life of the emerging nations of Europe.”&lt;ref name="Albert R. Jonsen"&gt;{{cite book| last=Jonsen| first=Albert| title=A Short History of Medical Ethics| year=2000| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=New York|isbn=0-19-513455-9|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the death of Eusebios in 370 and the election of Basil as bishop of Caesarea, Basil established the first formal soup kitchen, hospital, homeless shelter, hospice, poorhouse, orphanage, reform center for thieves, women’s center for those leaving prostitution and many other ministries. Basil was personally involved and invested in the projects and process giving all of his personal wealth to fund the ministries.  Basil himself would put on an apron and work in the soup kitchen.  These ministries were given freely regardless of religious affiliation.  Basil refused to make any discrimination when it came to people who needed help saying that “the digestive systems of the Jew and the Christian are indistinguishable.”&lt;ref name="Robert H. Bremner"&gt;{{cite book| last=Bremner| first=Robert H.| title=Giving: Charity and Philanthropy in History|year=2017| publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-1-56000-884-2|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "...there is a striking resemblance between [Basil's] ideals and those of modern times. ...certainly he was the most modern among the pioneers of monasticism, and for this reason, if for none other, his work has a permanent interest..."&lt;ref name="W.K.Lowther Clarke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke| first=W.K.Lowther|title=St.Basil the Great A Study in Monasticism| year=1913| publisher= Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge, England|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval period===
The Catholic Church established a hospital system in Medieval Europe that was different from the merely reciprocal hospitality of the Greeks and family-based obligations of the Romans. These hospitals were established to cater to "particular social groups marginalized by poverty, sickness, and age," according to historian of hospitals, Guenter Risse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mending Bodies, Saving Souls: A History of Hospitals |last=Risse |first=Guenter B |date=April 1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=59 |isbn=0-19-505523-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial Revolution===

[[File:LeoXIII1900.jpg|thumb|upright|In 1891 [[Pope Leo XIII]] issued ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' in which the Church defined the dignity and rights of industrial workers.]]

The [[Industrial Revolution]] brought many concerns about the deteriorating working and living conditions of urban workers. Influenced by the German Bishop [[Wilhelm Emmanuel Freiherr von Ketteler]], in 1891 [[Pope Leo XIII]] published the encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', which set in context [[Catholic social teaching]] in terms that rejected socialism but advocated the regulation of working conditions. ''Rerum Novarum'' argued for the establishment of a living wage and the right of workers to form trade unions.&lt;ref name="Duffy240"&gt;Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' was issued by [[Pope Pius XI]], on 15 May 1931, 40 years after ''Rerum novarum''. Unlike Leo, who addressed mainly the condition of workers, Pius XI concentrated on the ethical implications of the social and economic order. He called for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principle of [[wikt:solidarity|solidarity]] and [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]].&lt;ref&gt;Duffy 260&lt;/ref&gt; He noted major dangers for human freedom and dignity, arising from unrestrained capitalism and totalitarian communism.

The social teachings of [[Pope Pius XII]] repeat these teachings, and apply them in greater detail not only to workers and owners of capital, but also to other professions such as politicians, educators, house-wives, farmers [[bookkeeper]]s, [[international organization]]s, and all aspects of life including the military. Going beyond Pius XI, he also defined social teachings in the areas of medicine, [[psychology]], sport, TV, science, law and education. Pius XII was called "the Pope of Technology'' for his willingness and ability to examine the social implications of technological advances. The dominant concern was the continued rights and dignity of the individual. With the beginning of the [[space age]] at the end of his pontificate, Pius XII explored the social implications of space exploration and satellites on the social fabric of humanity asking for a new sense of community and solidarity in light of existing [[Social teachings of the papacy|papal teachings]] on subsidiarity.&lt;ref&gt;Felictity O'Brien, Pius XII, London 2000, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Methodist Church]], among other Christian denominations, was responsible for the establishment of hospitals, universities, orphanages, soup kitchens, and schools to follow Jesus's command to [[Great Commission|spread]] the [[the gospel|Good News]] and [[works of mercy|serve]] all people.&lt;ref name="Establishments"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0qKNkgSKPXsC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=wesleyan+christian+church+hospitals+schools+orphanages+universities+serve+others#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title =Models for Christian Higher Education: Strategies for Survival and Success in the Twenty-First Century|publisher = [[William B.

Humanitarian aid went beyond the individual help that many home missionaries were already providing to people within their care. It involved creating new structures that would augment the political, economic, and social systems so that those systems might be more humane. It included the establishment of Methodist hospitals in all the major cities in the United States. These hospitals were required to provide the best treatment possible free of charge to all who needed it, and were often staffed by deaconesses who trained as nurses. Homes for the aged and orphanages were also part of this work.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western nations, governments have increasingly taken up funding and organisation of health services for the poor but the Church still maintains a massive network of health care providers across the world. In the West, these institutions are increasingly run by lay-people after centuries of being run by priests, nuns and brothers, In 2009, Catholic hospitals in the USA received approximately one of every six patients, according to the Catholic Health Association.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/us/21nuns.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=2&amp;smid=fb-nytimes ''Nuns, a ‘Dying Breed,’ Fade From Leadership Roles at Catholic Hospitals'', New York Times, 20.8.11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catholic Health Australia]] is the largest non-government provider grouping of health, community and aged care services, representing about 10% of the health sector.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cha.org.au/site.php?id=24&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, nuns or priests were the chief executives of 770 of America's 796 Catholic hospitals. By 2011, they presided over 8 of 636 hospitals.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

As with schooling, women have played a vital role in running and staffing Christian care institutions – in Methodist hospitals, [[deaconesses]] who trained as nurses staffed the hospitals,&lt;ref name="Teasdale2014"/&gt; and in Catholic hospitals, through religious institutes like the [[Sisters of Mercy]], [[Little Sisters of the Poor]] and [[Sisters of St. Mary]] – and teaching and nursing have been seen as "women's vocations". Seeking to define the role played by [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] in hospitals through American history, the New York Times noted that nuns were trained to "see Jesus in the face of every patient" and that:&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

{{cquote|Although their influence is often described as intangible, the nuns kept their hospitals focused on serving the needy and brought a spiritual reassurance that healing would prevail over profit, authorities on Catholic health care say.}}

Missionary activity for the Catholic Church has always incorporated education of evangelized peoples as part of its social ministry. History shows that in evangelized lands, the first people to operate schools were Roman Catholics. In some countries, the Church is the main provider of education or significantly supplements government forms of education. Presently, the Church operates the world's largest non-governmental school system.&lt;ref name="Gardner148"&gt;Gardner, p.&amp;nbsp;148&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Western Civilization's most influential universities were founded by the Catholic Church.

A [[Pew Center]] study about [[Religiosity and education|religion and education]] around the world in 2016, found that [[Christians]] ranked as the second most educated religious group around in the [[world]] after [[Jews]] with an average of 9.3 years of schooling,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"&gt;{{cite web |date=December 19, 2011 |title=Religion and Education Around the World |url=http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/12/21094148/Religion-Education-ONLINE-FINAL.pdf |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the highest of years of schooling among Christians found in [[Germany]] (13.6),&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; [[New Zealand]] (13.5)&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and [[Estonia]] (13.1).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; [[Christians]] were also found to have the second highest number of [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees per capita while in absolute numbers ranked in the first place  (220 million).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; Between the various [[World Christianity|Christian communities]], [[Singapore]] outranks other nations in terms of Christians who obtain a university degree in institutions of [[higher education]] (67%),&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; followed by the [[Christianity in Israel|Christians of Israel]] (63%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bokra.net/Article-1155836 |title=  المسيحيون العرب يتفوقون على يهود إسرائيل في التعليم |website=Bokra |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Christianity in Georgia (country)|Christians of Georgia]] (57%).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;
According to the study, Christians in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[Asia]]-[[Pacific]] regions are highly educated since many of the world [[universities]] were built by the historic [[Christian denominations|Christian Churches]],&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; in addition to the historical evidence that "Christian monks built libraries and, in the days before printing presses, preserved important earlier writings produced in Latin, Greek and Arabic".&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the same study, Christians have a significant amount of [[gender equality]] in educational attainment,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and the study suggests that one of the reasons is the encouragement of the [[Protestant Reformers]] in promoting the [[education of women]], which led to the eradication of illiteracy among females in Protestant communities.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;
According to the same study "there is a large and pervasive gap in educational attainment between Muslims and Christians in sub-Saharan Africa" as [[Muslim]] adults in this region are far less educated than their [[Christian]] counterparts,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; with scholars suggesting that this gap is due to the educational facilities that were created by [[Christian missionaries]] during the colonial era for fellow believers.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

===Europe===

[[File:Oxford University Coat Of Arms.svg|thumb|upright|The [[Arms of the University of Oxford|coat of arms]] of the [[University of Oxford]], baring the Latin motto ''The Lord is my Light''. Europe's universities were essentially a Catholic invention.]]

The Catholic Church founded the West's first universities, which were preceded by the schools attached to monasteries and cathedrals, and generally staffed by monks and friars.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 530, [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict]] wrote his ''[[Rule of St Benedict|monastic Rule]]'', which became a blueprint for the organization of [[Monastery|monasteries]] throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="Woods27"&gt;Woods, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The new monasteries preserved classical craft and artistic skills while maintaining intellectual culture within their schools, [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]] and libraries. As well as providing a focus for spiritual life, they functioned as agricultural, economic and production centers, particularly in remote regions, becoming major conduits of civilization.&lt;ref name="LeGoff120"&gt;Le Goff, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cluniac reforms|Cluniac reform]] of monasteries that had begun in 910 sparked widespread monastic growth and renewal.&lt;ref name="Duffy88"&gt;Duffy, p. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Monasteries introduced new technologies and crops, fostered the creation and preservation of literature and promoted economic growth. Monasteries, convents and cathedrals still operated virtually all schools and libraries.&lt;ref name="Woods40"&gt;Woods, p. 40–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeGoff80"&gt;Le Goff, p. 80–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cathedral schools]] began in the Early Middle Ages as centers of advanced education, some of them ultimately evolving into [[medieval universities]]. During the High Middle Ages, [[Chartres Cathedral]] operated the famous and influential [[School of Chartres|Chartres Cathedral School]].

Universities began springing up in Italian towns like [[Salerno University|Salerno]], which became a leading medical school, translating the work of Greek and Arabic physicians into Latin. [[Bologna University]] became the most influential of the early universities, which first specialised in [[canon law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. [[Paris University]], specialising in such topics as theology, came to rival Bologna under the supervision of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]]. [[Oxford University]] in England later came to rival Paris in Theology and [[Salamanca University]] was founded in Spain in 1243. According to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], the universities benefited from the use of Latin, the common language of the Church, and its internationalist reach, and their role was to "teach, argue and reason within a Christian framework".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of enquiry and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including [[Robert Grosseteste]] of the [[University of Oxford]], an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07037a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Robert Grosseteste |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 June 1910 |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Saint [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], a pioneer of biological field research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Albertus Magnus |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 March 1907 |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, [[mendicant orders]] were founded by [[Francis of Assisi]] and [[Dominic de Guzmán]] which brought [[Consecrated life (Catholic Church)|consecrated religious life]] into urban settings.&lt;ref name="LeGoff87"&gt;Le Goff, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; These orders also played a large role in the development of cathedral schools into [[Medieval university|universities]], the direct ancestors of the modern Western institutions.&lt;ref name="Woods44"&gt;Woods, p. 44–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable [[scholasticism|scholastic]] theologians such as the Dominican [[Thomas Aquinas]] worked at these universities, his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' was a key intellectual achievement in its synthesis of [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] thought and Christianity.&lt;ref name="Bokenkotter158"&gt;Bokenkotter, p. 158–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

The university reached central Europe by the 14th century, with the foundation of institutions like [[Prague University]] and [[Cracow University]].

The Spaniard [[St Ignatius Loyola]] founded the [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuits) in 1540. Initially a missionary order, the Jesuits took Western learning and the Catholic faith to India, Japan, China, Canada, Central and South America and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14081a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: The Jesuits (The Society of Jesus)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order became increasingly involved in education, founding schools, colleges and universities across the globe and [[List of alumni of Jesuit educational institutions|educating such notable Western scholars, intellectuals, artists and statesmen]] as [[René Descartes]], [[Matteo Ricci]], [[Voltaire]], [[Pierre de Coubertin]], [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[James Joyce]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] and [[Bill Clinton]].

According to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], the university became a hallmark of Christian Civilisation, though, he writes, "in the most recent century perhaps no institution has done more to promote an alternative or secular view of the world".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Latin America===
Education in Latin American began under the direction of missionaries who were sponsored by the Spanish crown. Royal policy stipulated that the Amerindians had to accept missionaries but they did not have to convert. Indians who agreed to listen to the missionaries were not subjected to work for [[encomendero]]s some of whom were notorious for brutal conditions.&lt;ref name="Noble450"&gt;Noble, p. 450–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Catholic universities, schools and colleges have been formed in the United States. The religious tolerance established by the [[American Revolution]] enabled the Catholic clergy of Maryland to found [[Georgetown University]], America's oldest Catholic university, in 1789 and it became a Jesuit institution in 1805.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06458a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Georgetown University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saint [[Katharine Drexel]] inherited a fortune and established the [[Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament|Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament

By the close of the 19th century, European powers had managed to gain control of most of the African interior.&lt;ref name="Has398"/&gt; The new rulers introduced cash-based economies which created an enormous demand for literacy and a western education—a demand which for most Africans could only be satisfied by Christian missionaries.&lt;ref name="Has398"/&gt; Catholic missionaries followed colonial governments into Africa, and built schools, hospitals, monasteries and churches.&lt;ref name="Has398"/&gt;

With a high number of adult baptisms, the Church is growing faster in Africa than anywhere else.&lt;ref name="Froehle46"&gt;Froehle, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; It also operates a greater number of Catholic schools per parish here (3:1) than in other areas of the world.&lt;ref name="Froehle48"&gt;Froehle, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
In India, over 25,000 schools and colleges are operated by the Church.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7587319.stm | work=BBC News | title=Catholic schools in India protest | date=29 August 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protestant role in education ===
[[File:HarvardElizaSusanQuincy1836.jpg|thumb|200px|upright=1.2|[[Harvard College]], historically one of several favored undergraduate schools for the Protestant elite. Seen here is the 1836 Harvard alumni procession.]]
As the Reformers wanted all members of the church to be able to read the Bible, education on all levels got a strong boost. Compulsory education for both boys and girls was introduced. For example, the [[Puritans]] who established [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1628 founded [[Harvard College]] only eight years later. Seven of the first nine of what are called [[colonial colleges]] were founded by Christians including [[Colombia University]], [[Brown University]], [[Rutgers University]] and [[Yale University]] (1701); a nineteenth century book on "Colleges in America" says, "Eighty three percent of the colleges in [the U.S.] were founded by Christian philanthropy."&lt;ref name="John Marshall Barker"&gt;{{cite book| last=Barker| first = John Marshall| title = Colleges in America| year =1894| publisher=The University of Wooster| page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pennsylvania]] also became a centre of learning as one of the colleges not specifically Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., pp. 69–80, 88–89, 114–117, 186–188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Schmidt, ''Kongregationalismus'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band III (1959), Tübingen (Germany), col. 1770&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of [[mainline Protestant]]s have played leadership roles in many aspects of American life, including politics, business, science, the arts, and education. They founded most of the country's leading institutes of higher education.&lt;ref name=mainline2000&gt;McKinney, William. "Mainline Protestantism 2000."

Protestantism also initiated translations of the Bible into national languages and thereby supported the development of national literatures.&lt;ref name="Olúfémi Táíwò"&gt;{{cite book| last= Táíwò| first=Olúfémi| title=How Colonialism Preempted Modernity in Africa| year=2010| publisher=University of Indiana Press| location=Bloomington, Indiana| isbn=978-0-253-35374-0| page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Thao Vang"&gt;{{cite book| last= Vang| first="Christopher Thao"| title=Hmong Refugees in the New World: Culture, Community and Opportunity|year=2016|publisher=McFarland and Company| location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-1-4766-6216-9|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sena/Sen Empire''' ({{lang-bn|সেন সাম্রাজ্য}}, ''Shen Shamrajjo'') was a [[Hindu]] [[dynasty]] during the [[Classical India|Late Classical period]] on the [[Indian subcontinent]], that ruled from [[Bengal]] through the 11th and 12th centuries. The empire at its peak covered much of the north-eastern region of the Indian subcontinent. The rulers of the Sena Dynasty traced their origin to the south Indian region of [[Karnataka]].&lt;ref&gt;The History of the Bengali Language by Bijay Chandra Mazumdar p.50&lt;/ref&gt; 

The dynasty's founder was Samanta Sena. After him came Hemanta Sena who usurped power and styled himself king in 1095 AD. His successor [[Vijaya Sena]] (ruled from 1096 AD to 1159 AD) helped lay the foundations of the dynasty, and had an unusually long reign of over 60 years. [[Ballala Sena]] conquered [[Gaur, West Bengal|Gaur]] from the Pala, became the ruler of the Bengal Delta, and made [[Nabadwip]] the capital as well. Ballala Sena married Ramadevi a princess of the [[Western Chalukya Empire]] which indicates that the Sena rulers maintained close social contact with south India.&lt;ref&gt;Land of Two Rivers: A History of Bengal from the Mahabharata to Mujib  by Nitish K. Sengupta p.51&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lakshmana Sena]] succeeded Ballala Sena in 1179, ruled Bengal for approximately 20 years, and expanded the Sena Empire to [[Assam]], [[Odisha]], Bihar and probably to [[Varanasi]]. In 1203–1204 AD, the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] general [[Ikhtiyar Uddin Muhammad Bin Bakhtiyar Khalji|Bakhtiyar Khalji]] attacked Nabadwip. Khalji defeated Lakshman Sen and captured northwest Bengal – although Eastern Bengal remained under Sena control.

==Origins==
The political space after the decline of the Pala power in Bengal was occupied by the Senas whose king Vijayasena succeeded in conquering a large part of Pala territory. The Senas were the supporters of orthodox Hinduism. The dynasty traces its origin to the South, and had connections with the [[Western Chalukya Empire]] of southern India.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Ancient India by [[R. C. Majumdar|Ramesh Chandra Majumdar]] p.320&lt;/ref&gt; Theres is a record of a Western Chalukya invasion during the reign of [[Someshvara I]] led by his son [[Vikramaditya VI]] who defeated the kings of Gauda and Kamarupa.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Cambridge Shorter History of India p.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.P. Sinha in George E. Somers, Dynastic History of Magadha, p.214, Abhinav Publications, 1977, New Delhi, {{ISBN|81-7017-059-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This invasion of the [[Kannada people|Kannada]] ruler brought bodies of his countrymen from Karnataka into Bengal which explains the origin of the Sena Dynasty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The founder of the Sena rule was Samantasena who described himself as a Brahma-Kshatriya of Karnataka ([[Karnataka]]). He himself stated that he fought the outlaws of Karnataka and later turned an ascetic.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The inscriptions of the Sena kings mention them as Brahma-Kshatriyas (Brahmins who ruled as Kshatriyas) or Kshatriyas.&lt;ref name="Indenp60"&gt;{{cite book | author= Ronald.

Sena Dynasty had ruled Bengal for little over a century (c 1097–1225). The emergence of the dynasty, which supplanted the Palas in Bengal towards the close of 11th century A.D., had constituted a significant epoch in the history of ancient India. Taking advantage of the revolt of Samantachakra in Varendra during the reign of Mahipala II, Vijayasena, founder of the Sena dynasty, gradually consolidated his position in western Bengal and ultimately assumed an independent position during the reign of Madanapala. One important aspect of Sena rule in Bengal is that the whole territory of Bengal was brought under a single rule for the first time. It is likely impossible to provide definite information to the question as to how the family entered Bengal. The Sena records also are amazingly silent about this.

The Sena kings claim in their own inscriptions that they are Brahma-Kshatriyas. Their remote ancestor was one Virasena, whose name was supposed to have been mentioned in Puranas. The "[[Deopara Prashasti|Deopara Inscription]]" of the Senas also traces the Sena ancestry from Virasena. Since there are no authentic records available still, a keen controversy prevails among scholars regarding origin of the Senas.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Like the origin of the Senas, their early history or circumstances, which led them to concentrate in Bengal is also still unknown. It has been presumed by historians that the Senas came to Bengal on the eve of the invading army led by the Chalukya kings Vikramaditya VI and Someswara III. Some scholars have also suggested that when Rajendra Chola's army had invaded Bengal, the Senas had accompanied them. According to some other historians, a few Karnataka officials, who were subordinate to the Pala kings, had established their independent kingdom in the region of Radha, taking advantage of the weakness of the Pala powers. Those Karnataka chiefs might have arrived in Bengal in wake of the Chalukya invasion and had settled into a kingdom of their own. According to historians Samantasena was such a chief who had established his independent kingdom in the Radha region of Bengal.

Samantasena was a scion of the Sena family, who had distinguished himself through various warfares in South India. He had settled in Radha in Bengal, at an old age. He had also laid the foundation of the Sena family in Bengal. His son Hemantasena carved out an important kingdom in Radha, taking advantage of the decline of the Pala Empire. From their base in Radha, the Senas ultimately extended their powers over the whole of Bengal.&lt;ref name="sen"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Edilpur copperplate.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Edilpur Copperplate]]
{{Sena dynasty}}
A copperplate was found in the Adilpur or Edilpur [[pargana]] of [[Faridpur District]] in 1838 A.D. and was acquired by the [[Asiatic Society of Bengal]], but now the copperplate is missing from collection. An account of the copperplate was published in the ''Dacca Review'' and ''Epigraphic Indica''. The copperplate inscription is written in [[Sanskrit]] and in [[Ganda language|Ganda]] character, and dated 3rd [[Joishtho|jyaistha]] of 1136 samval, or 1079 A.D. In the Asiatic Society's proceeding for January 1838, an account of the copperplate states that three villages were given to a [[Brahman]] in the third year of [[Keshava Sena]].  The grant was given with the landlord rights, which include the power of punishing the chandrabhandas or [[Sundarban]]s, a race that lived in the forest.&lt;ref name=BangChit&gt;{{Citation

The copperplate of [[Keshava Sena]] records that the king Vallala Sena carried away, from the enemies, the goddesses of fortune on palanquins ([[Ashvamedha|Shivaka]]), which elephant tusk staff supported; and also states that Vallala Sena's son, Lakshmana Sena (1179–1205), erected pillars of victory and sacrificial posts at Varanasi, Allahabad, and Adon Coast of the South Sea. The copperplate also describes the villages with smooth fields growing excellent paddy, the dancing and music in ancient Bengal, and ladies adorned with blooming flowers. The Edilpur copperplate of Keshava Sena records that the king made a grant in favour of Nitipathaka Isvaradeva Sarman for the inscae of the subha-varsha.

The [[Deopara Prashasti]] is a stone inscription eulogising the Sena kings, particularly [[Vijaya Sena]], composed by the court poet Umapati Dhara.

The Sena rulers consolidated the caste system in Bengal. Although Bengal borrowed from the caste system of [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]], caste was not so strong in Bengal as in Mithila.&lt;ref&gt;Momtazur Rahman Tarafdar, "Itihas O Aitihasik", Bangla Academy Dhaka, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The Sena dynasty is famous for building [[Hindu temple]]s and monasteries, which include the renowned [[Dhakeshwari Temple]] in what is now [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh.

In Kashmir, the dynasty also likely built a temple knows as Sankara Gaureshwara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mitra |first=Rajendralala |date=1865 |title=On the Sena Rajas of Bengal |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/128113#page/195/mode/1up |journal=Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal |volume=34 part 1 |issue=3 |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bengal |pages=141–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
The Sena rulers were also great patrons of literature. During the Pala dynasty and the Sena dynasty, major growth in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] was witnessed. Some Bengali authors believe that [[Jayadeva]], the famous Sanskrit poet and author of [[Gita Govinda]], was one of the ''Pancharatnas'' (five gems) in the court of Lakshmana Sena.
[[Dhoyin]] – himself an eminent court poet of Sena dynasty – mentions nine gems (ratna) in the court of Lakshmana Sena, among whom were:
* Govardhana
* Sarana
* Jayadeva
* Umapati
* Dhoyi/ [[Dhoyin]] Kaviraja&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=R. C. Majumdar |year=1943 |title=The History of Bengal, vol I (Hindu Period) |place=Lohanipur}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2018}}

==Legacy==
After the Sena dynasty, the Deva dynasty ruled in eastern Bengal. The [[Deva dynasty]] was probably the last independent Hindu dynasty of Bengal.

"'''Shallow Be Thy Game'''" is a song by [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and was the fourth single from their 1995 album, ''[[One Hot Minute]]''. The single was released in Australia only. It was also the only single from the album not to have a music video made for it, as it was a promotional single in Australia released during their May 1996 Australian tour dates.

The song is quite polemic in its direct assault on fundamentalist religion, which the lyrics openly mock.

== Live performances ==
Despite being a single, the song was performed very rarely on the [[One Hot Minute tour]] and has not been performed since 1996 and never in the [[United States]].

The '''''Sortes Astrampsychi''''' ('''''Oracles of Astrampsychus''''') was a popular [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] [[fortune-telling]] guide ascribed to Astrampsychus, identified by ancient authors as a [[magus]] who lived in Persia before the conquest of [[Alexander the Great]],&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius [[s:Lives of the Eminent Philosophers/Book I|1.2]].&lt;/ref&gt; or an Egyptian sage serving a [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] king.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;  While other [[Sortes (ancient Rome)|sortes]] (means of fortune-telling) involved the casting of dice, the ''Sortes Astrampsychi'' did not. Instead, a questioner chose a prewritten question, to which a number was assigned; calling on divine inspiration, the questioner then spoke a number from one to ten, which was added to the question number; the oracle-monger then provided one of ten possible replies by consulting a numerical index. The text is known from thirteen papyrus fragments of the third to sixth centuries CE, and from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] manuscripts which date from the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries but are completely preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Willy, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Byzantine texts add Christian religious elements.

In a preface to the ''Sortes'', the author, identifying himself as "Astrampsychus of Egypt" and addressing his remarks "to King Ptolemy," goes on to claim that the book was actually "an invention of [[Pythagoras]] the philosopher," and boasts that "King [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] of Macedon ruled the world by using this method of deciding matters."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, pp. 291-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of later treatises have been spuriously ascribed to Astrampsychus, including a book on healing donkeys, a guide for interpreting dreams, a discussion of [[lapidary]] stones for use in astrology, a work on geomancy, and a volume of love charms.&lt;ref&gt;Oberhelman, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first English translation of the ''Sortes Astrampsychi'' by Stewart and Morrell was published in 1998 as "The Oracles of Astrampsychus" in ''Anthology of Ancient Greek Popular Literature''; the editor, William Hansen, provides an introduction with details about the history of the document and instructions for its use. In 2006 an edition of the Greek text with a German translation by Kai Brodersen was published as ''Astrampsychos: Das Pythagoras-Orakel''.

'''''Stedman v United Kingdom''''' (1997) 23 EHRR CD 168 is a [[UK labour law]] case, which deals with religious freedom, and the duty of an employer to let religious people have Sundays off.

==Facts==
Ms Stedman, a Christian, had worked at an employment agency since 1990. From December 1991 the
applicant, along with other staff, was required to work on Sundays. In the period from December 1991 to May 1992 she worked on 10 out of a total of 25 Sundays. On 27 April 1992 Ms. Stedman gave the manager one month's notice that she was no longer prepared to work on Sunday. On 7 May 1992 she was told that her contract of employment was to be amended to include Sunday as a normal working day, on a rota basis, with no enhanced rate of pay. The applicant refused to sign the new contract and said that she would continue working under her existing contract.  On 4 June 1992 she was dismissed after 22 months of employment, and paid one month's pay in lieu of notice.

She claimed this was a breach of her right to [[freedom of religion]] under Art.9 ECHR. Under Art.1 the MS must secure Convention rights. She also complained of breach of her right to a family life under Art.8, because she was bound to work some Sundays, and her husband did not.

==Judgment==
The [[European Commission of Human Rights]] (i.e. the case was not admitted to the actual court) stated by a majority that Ms Stedman resigned because she did not want to work. She was not dismissed because of her religion. Even if she had been employed by the state and dismissed in similar circumstances, there would not have even been an interference with her Art 9(1) rights. The application was ‘manifestly ill founded’ under Art 27(2) ECHR.

For Art 8, ‘given the almost inevitable compromise and balance between work and family commitments, particularly in families where both partners work’ there was no interference, to constitute any violation. 
Other challenges under Art.14 and Art.6 were similarly dismissed, and the case was inadmissible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9589">[[File:Lapage acorn and pumpkin.jpg|thumb|Jules Sebastien-Lepage's illustration of La Fontaine's fable, 1881. Art Institute of Chicago]]
'''The Acorn and the Pumpkin''', in French ''Le gland et la citrouille'', is one of [[La Fontaine's Fables]], published in his second volume (IX.4) in 1679. In English especially, new versions of the story were written to support the [[teleological argument]] for creation favoured by English thinkers from the end of the 17th century onwards.

==Popular theology==
The fable is one of the few by La Fontaine without a certain origin, although it is generally acknowledged that it owes something to a piece of street farce by [[Tabarin]] earlier in the 17th century. Beginning with the statement that "God's creation is well made", it recounts how a country bumpkin questions intelligent design in the creation by supposing that it would be better if oaks bore pumpkins and feeble vines supported acorns. He falls asleep beneath the tree and is awakened by the fall of an acorn, taking the comparative lack of injury he suffers as sufficient evidence of [[divine providence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7241/7241-h/7241-h.htm#IX3 Elizur Wright translation online]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been surmised, however, that the ironical author's real target is the weakness of such moral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Peter France, “The poet as a teacher” in ''Poetry in France: metamorphoses of a muse'', Edinburgh U 1992, p.138&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to be substantiated by the fact that the argument employed is based on a joke in a farce that was not meant to be taken seriously. In the East, the same joke recommended itself to the compilers of similarly ambivalent stories about [[Nasreddin Hodja]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rodneyohebsion.com/mulla-nasrudin.htm "Walnuts and watermelons"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, however, the fable was taken much more seriously as support for the teleological argument being put forward by theologians and philosophers at about that time. [[Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea]], was the first to adapt the fable as a polemic against atheism, giving her poem the new title "The Atheist and the Acorn".&lt;ref&gt;''Specimens of British Poetesses'', London 1825, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hOJIAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;ots=kCJ1IJQT7p&amp;dq=Anne%2C%20Countess%20of%20Winchelsea%2C%20The%20Atheist%20and%20the%20Acorn&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q=Anne,%20Countess%20of%20Winchelsea,%20The%20Atheist%20and%20the%20Acorn&amp;f=false pp.134-6]&lt;/ref&gt; In place of La Fontaine's introductory reassurance that "God's creation is well made", the poem begins with the opposite proposition, "Methinks this world is oddly made, And every thing’s amiss," as uttered by "a dull presuming atheist". A combative stance replaces genial irony and the piece ends with the grotesque image of a smashed skull letting out its false suppositions.&lt;ref&gt;Jayne Elizabeth Lewis, ''The English Fable: Aesop and Literary Culture, 1651-1740'', Cambridge University 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X8LjyBY7py0C&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;ots=YZdWXmFM_5&amp;dq=the%20acorn%20and%20the%20atheist&amp;pg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20acorn%20and%20the%20atheist&amp;f=false pp.139-40]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his version of La Fontaine in the ''Select Fables'' of 1754, Charles Denis returns to the title "The acorn and the pumpkin" and a more lightly nuanced spirit. "Whatever is, is right" is its opening proposition, and the repentant "bumpkin" is finally brought to "give Providence its due".&lt;ref&gt;Fable 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JW5bAAAAQAAJ&amp;ots=f6od9QToF9&amp;dq=Fables%20%20Denis&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q=acorn&amp;f=false pp.16-18]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year of 1754, [[Robert Dodsley]] included a prose version in the modern fables section of his ''Select fables of Esop and other fabulists''.&lt;ref&gt;Fable 15, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LlYMAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA239&amp;ots=ve71_n8AtV&amp;dq=the%20fable%20of%20the%20atheist%20and%20the%20acorn%20%20%22Dodsley%22&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q=acorn&amp;f=false pp.93-4]&lt;/ref&gt; The piece preserves Anne Finch's title of "The atheist and the acorn" but is otherwise made a light hearted anecdote. It is "one of those refined reasoners, otherwise called Minute Philosophers," who speculates at his ease beneath an oak tree. But he finds, with the circumstance of the falling acorn, "how small a trifle may overturn the systems of mighty philosophers!"

By the end of the 18th century the story was again returned to the sphere of popular theology by [[Hannah More]]. She made her poem "The two gardeners" a completely new treatment of the subject and published it as one of her [[Cheap Repository Tracts]] in 1797.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ota.ahds.ac.uk/text/4235.html University of Oxford text archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Two gardeners debate the wisdom of creation and the free thinker becomes convinced that "God is wiser far than me" at the thought of the harm that a shower of "pompions" might have done to his head. Charles Linley the younger (1834–69) was later to rewrite the story of "The acorn and the pumpkin" for children in his ''Old Saws Newly Set'' (London 1864),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/oldsawsnewlyset00linlgoog#page/n21/mode/2up/search/acorn pp.12-13]&lt;/ref&gt; with the same moral purpose. His conclusion is, "With rev'rent glance Creation scan, And learn thy littleness, O Man!" The same solemnity underlies the unascribed prose retelling at the head of the section on creation in yet another work of popular theology, ''Anecdotes and Examples illustrating the Catholic catechism'', published in New York in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Google Books, [https://books.google.com/books?id=--ELAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=%22the%20acorn%20and%20the%20pumpkin%22&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20acorn%20and%20the%20pumpkin%22&amp;f=false pp.39-40]&lt;/ref&gt; The anecdote illustrates the proposition with which it begins, that "The wisdom of God is displayed in creation."

==Wit in translation==
Less programmatic translations of the fable show the various strategies employed by fellow poets to give a sense of La Fontaine's graceful wit. The French is written in an approximation of irregularly rhyming [[vers libre]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la-fontaine-ch-thierry.net/glancitr.htm Online text]&lt;/ref&gt; of which only Norman R. Shapiro tries to give an idea, although at the expense of often paraphrasing the sense and lacking his original's lightness of touch.&lt;ref&gt;''50 Fables of  La Fontaine'', University of Illinois 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zg11GWzMuZEC&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=%22the%20acorn%20and%20the%20pumpkin%22&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20acorn%20and%20the%20pumpkin%22&amp;f=false p.93]&lt;/ref&gt; Paraphrase without the excuse of reproducing the original style is also the approach of the very first translation of the poem into English by [[Bernard de Mandeville]] in 1704.&lt;ref&gt;''Aesop Dress'd, or a collection of fables writ in familiar verse,'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33888/33888.txt p.4]&lt;/ref&gt; This is written in [[octosyllabic]] [[couplets]] whose aim is to characterise the "Self conceited Country Bumkin” of the fable. La Fontaine's starting point is deferred by his interpreter to the six-line moral drawn at the end, beginning
::The World's vast Fabrick is so well

William Trowbridge Larned's version for children is written in four regularly rhymed six-lined stanzas in [[Dactyl (poetry)|dactylic metre]] and tries to give a sense of La Fontaine's light heartedness. Its resulting colloquiality makes the protagonist a little too rustic, replacing as it does the original's simple exclamation “Oh! Oh!” with “Gosh!” and having him refer to himself as “Clever me".&lt;ref&gt;''Fables in Rhyme for Little Folks from the French of La Fontaine'', New York 1918, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/24108/24108.txt Gutenberg]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marianne Moore]] too makes of her adult version more of a recreation than an exact translation. An admirer of her work places this fable among her more successful interpretations, which he judges as “worth putting up as running mates or rivals of the original...that delight without halting to instruct explicitly”.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Stapleton, ''Marianne Moore: The Poet's Advance'', Princeton University 1978, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wZZ9BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA275&amp;dq=%22the%20acorn%20and%20the%20pumpkin%22&amp;pg=PA178#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20acorn%20and%20the%20pumpkin%22&amp;f=false p.178]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic interpretations==
[[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]]'s classic illustration of La Fontaine's fable, dating originally from the 1730s, showed the peasant lying face upward asleep beneath an oak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/Wave/image/joconde/0455/m078402_0001135_p.jpg Joconde catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; It was this interpretation that was later followed in the 18th century Portuguese tiles illustrating the fables that line the cloisters of the [[Monastery of São Vicente de Fora]] in Lisbon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/8724323@N06/4634450047/in/set-72157624124619360 Flickr gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; In his line engraving for a 1931 English edition of the fables, Stephen Frederick Gooden preferred to show the rustic philosopher pondering the acorn that has just fallen on his head as he lies beside a pumpkin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allinsongallery.com/gooden/acorn.html View online]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in his 1881 [[watercolour]], the French Realist painter, [[Jules Bastien-Lepage]], has a blue-clad peasant peering at a large pumpkin in a wheelbarrow.

"'''Thou shalt have no other gods before Me'''" ([[Hebrew]]: {{Script/Hebrew| לא יהיה־לך אלהים אחרים על־פני}}) is one of the [[Ten Commandments]] found in the [[Hebrew Bible]] at {{bibleverse||Exodus|20:2|HE}} and  {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|5:6|HE}},&lt;ref&gt;Ten Commandments, in ''HarperCollins Bible Dictionary'', 1996, Achtemeier Paul J., ed., New York:HarperCollins Publishers, {{ISBN|0-06-060037-3}}. [[LXX]] gives two slightly different renditions of the identical Hebrew verses: {{lang|grc|οὐκ ἔσονταί σοι θεοὶ ἕτεροι πλὴν ἐμοῦ}} vs.  {{lang|grc|οὐκ ἔσονταί σοι θεοὶ ἕτεροι πρὸ προσώπου μου}}&lt;/ref&gt; which establishes the nature of the relationship between the [[Israelites|nation of Israel]] and its [[national god]], [[Yahweh]] the god of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;God: names of God, in ''Illustrated Dictionary &amp; Concordance of the Bible'', 1986. Wigoder, Geoffrey, ed., G.G. The Jerusalem Publishing House {{ISBN|0-89577-407-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; a covenant initiated by Yahweh after delivering the Israelites from slavery through the [[plagues of Egypt]] and [[the Exodus]].&lt;ref&gt;Moses, ''World Book Encyclopedia'' 1998, Chicago:World Book Inc., {{ISBN|0-7166-0098-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a general sense, [[idolatry]] is the paying of divine honor to any created thing.&lt;ref&gt;Idol, Image, in ''The New Unger’s Bible Dictionary,'' 2006. Unger, Merrill F., [[R. K. Harrison|Harrison, R.K.]], ed.  Chicago: Moody Publishers  {{ISBN|0-8024-9066-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient times, opportunities to participate in the honor or worship of other deities abounded. However, according to the [[Book of Deuteronomy]], the Israelites were strictly warned to neither adopt nor adapt any of the religious practices of the peoples around them.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 12:4,31; [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/henry/mhc1.Deu.xiii.html ''Matthew Henry’s Commentary on the Whole Bible''], Commentary on Deuteronomy 12&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the story of the people of Israel until the [[Babylonian Captivity]] is the story of the violation of the first commandment by the worship of “foreign gods” and its consequences.  Much of biblical preaching from the time of [[Moses]] to the exile is predicated on the either-or choice between exclusive worship of God and false gods.&lt;ref&gt;Idolatry, ''HarperCollins Bible Dictionary'', 1996, Achtemeier Paul J., ed., New York:HarperCollins Publishers, {{ISBN|0-06-060037-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Babylonian exile seems to have been a turning point after which the Jewish people as a whole were strongly monotheistic and willing to fight battles (such as the Maccabean Revolt) and face martyrdom before paying homage to any other god.&lt;ref&gt;Idol: In the Exile and After, in ''HarperCollins Bible Dictionary'', 1996, Achtemeier Paul J., ed., New York:HarperCollins Publishers, {{ISBN|0-06-060037-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shema]] and its accompanying blessing/curse reveals the intent of the commandment to include love for the one, true God and not only recognition or outward observance.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4-5; Wylen, Stephen M., ''Settings of Silver: an introduction to Judaism'', 2000, Paulist Press, {{ISBN|0-8091-3960-X}} pp.104&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Gospels]], [[Jesus]] quotes the Shema as the first and [[Greatest Commandment]],&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 22:37; Mark 12:30; Luke 10:27; Shema, in ''HarperCollins Bible Dictionary'', 1996, Achtemeier Paul J., ed., New York:HarperCollins Publishers, {{ISBN|0-06-060037-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the apostles after him preached that those who would follow Christ must turn from idols. The Catholic Catechism as well as Reformation and post-Reformation theologians teach that the commandment applies in modern times and prohibits the worship of physical idols, the seeking of spiritual activity or guidance from any other source (e.g. magical, astrological, etc.), and the focus on temporal priorities such as self (food, physical pleasures), work, and money, for examples.&lt;ref&gt;Idolatry: Figurative, in ''The New Unger’s Bible Dictionary'', 2006. Unger, Merrill F., Harrison, R.K., ed., Chicago: Moody Publishers, {{ISBN|0-8024-9066-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Catechism  commends those who refuse even to simulate such worship in a cultural context, since “the duty to offer God authentic worship concerns man both as an individual and as a social being.”&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church  2136&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient understanding ==
"[[Elohim]]" ({{Lang-he-n|אֱלֹהִים}}) is one of the [[Names of God in Judaism|names of God in the Hebrew Bible]]. Though it has the masculine plural ending, it does not mean "gods" when referring to the god of Israel, and in such cases is (usually) used with singular verbs, adjectives, and pronouns (for example, in {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:26|HE}}). In the traditional Jewish view, Elohim is the name of God as the creator and judge of the universe ({{bibleverse||Genesis|1:1-2:4a|HE}}).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hebrew4christians.com/Names_of_G-d/Elohim/elohim.html&lt;/ref&gt; H430 {{Hebrew|אלהים}} 'ĕlôhı̂ym  el-o-heem': Plural of H433; gods in the ordinary sense; but specifically used (in the plural thus, especially with the article) of the supreme God; occasionally applied by way of deference to magistrates; and sometimes as a superlative: - angels, X exceeding, God (gods) (-dess, -ly), X (very) great, judges, X mighty.&lt;ref&gt;Strong's Bible Concordance&lt;/ref&gt; According to some contemporary scholarship, the Second Commandment is presented in deliberate distinction to the Golden Calf, which represents moral systems that place undue emphasis on the worldly categories of power, beauty, and the works of our own hands.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hazony]], [http://davidhazony.typepad.com/david-hazony/the-ten-commandments.html The Ten Commandments] (Scribner, 2010), ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is part of the narrative developed in the texts that would later be collected in the Hebrew Bible during the 7th century BC, establishing a long history of national identity, originating with the remote founding-father [[Abraham]], to whom the God that would later identify Himself as Yahweh first revealed Himself.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua 24:2; [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom07.xxvii.i.html John Calvin (1509-1564) ''Commentary on Joshua''], Commentary on Joshua 24:2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 12:1; Idolatry, ; Idol, Image, in ''The New Unger’s Bible Dictionary'', 2006. Unger, Merrill F., Harrison, R.K., ed., Chicago: Moody Publishers, {{ISBN|0-8024-9066-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Yahweh comes up in the narrative of the [[Book of Exodus]], where [[Moses]]  encounters God at the [[burning bush]]. At this point, God reveals His proper name ''Yahweh'' for the first time, identifying Himself as identical with the God already encountered by Moses' ancestors Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (Israel):
{{quote|Thus you will say to Israel’s sons: “Yahweh your fathers’ deity, Abraham’s deity, Isaac’s deity, and Jacob’s deity – He has sent me to you;” This is My name to eternity, and this is My designation age (by) age.  | Exodus 3:15 (Anchor Bible)}}

In the Exodus narrative, after about 400 years of slavery in Egypt, the Israelites are delivered through the [[plagues of Egypt]].  After Moses leads them out in [[the Exodus]], Yahweh makes a covenant with the Israelites on the basis of this deliverance.&lt;ref&gt;Moses, ''World Book Encyclopedia'' 1998, Chicago:World Book Inc., {{ISBN|0-7166-0098-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ten Commandments summarize the terms of this covenant, beginning with the commandment to have no other gods before him. Seemingly unrelated prohibitions, such as not to sow mixed seed, wear clothing of mixed fibers, or mark one’s body (i.e., tattoo), were possibly intended to keep the Israelites separate from practices associated with magical benefits or the honor of other deities.&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 19:28; Idol, Image, in ''The New Unger’s Bible Dictionary'', 2006. Unger, Merrill F., Harrison, R.K., ed., Chicago: Moody Publishers, {{ISBN|0-8024-9066-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The individual who violated this commandment was subject to destruction on the testimony of two witnesses, and should the worship of other gods pervade the nation, it was subject to destruction as a whole&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 22:20; Deuteronomy 13:6-10; Idolatry: Penalties, in ''The New Unger’s Bible Dictionary'', 2006. Unger, Merrill F., Harrison, R.K., ed., Chicago: Moody Publishers, {{ISBN|0-8024-9066-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A person who attempted to involve others in worship of a false god was similarly subject to capital punishment and was not to be spared even by a close relative.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 17:2-7; Deuteronomy 13:6-10; Harper, William R., ''The Old and New Testament Student'', 1891, Hartford:The Student Publishing Company, p.201&lt;/ref&gt; God’s interest in exclusive worship is portrayed as a strong jealousy, like that of a husband for his wife. “Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you;  for Yahweh your God, who is among you, is a jealous God and His anger will burn against you, and He will destroy you from the face of the land.”&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 6:14-15; God, ''Illustrated Dictionary &amp; Concordance of the Bible'', 1986. Wigoder, Geoffrey, ed., G.G. The Jerusalem Publishing House, Inc.  {{ISBN|0-89577-407-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this personal relationship and its exclusive conditions, the story of the people of Israel until the [[Babylonian Captivity]] is the story of the violation of the first commandment by the worship of “foreign gods” and its consequences.  Not only did the common people substitute Canaanite gods and worship for the one true God, polytheism and worship of foreign gods became virtually official in both the northern and southern kingdoms despite repeated warnings from the [[prophet]]s of God.&lt;ref&gt;God in the OT, ''The Anchor Bible Dictionary'', Vol II, 1992. Freedman, David Noel, ed., New York: Doubleday. {{ISBN|0-385-19360-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Much of the power of biblical preaching from Moses to the time of the Exile comes from its stark either-or choice between Yahweh and the ‘other gods.” The great ninth-century B.C. contest at Carmel in 1 Kings 18 between Yahweh and Baal regarding control of the rain, hence of deity, contains the challenge of [[Elijah]]: “If the Lord is God, follow Him, but if Baal, then follow him.” | Idolatry, ''HarperCollins Bible Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;Idolatry, ''HarperCollins Bible Dictionary'', 1996, Achtemeier Paul J., ed., New York:HarperCollins Publishers, {{ISBN|0-06-060037-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Despite the clear victory and winning of the people’s allegiance that day, the official, polytheistic policy propelled by King Ahab’s wife Jezebel was unchanged.

[[Jeremiah]], [[Ezekiel]] and [[Hosea]] referred to Israel’s worship of other gods as spiritual adultery:&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 3:6-9, 5:7,  Ezekiel 16:38, 23:37, Hosea 1:2; Adultery: OT Words, in ''Expository Dictionary of Bible Words: Word studies for key English Bible words based on the Hebrew and Greek Texts'', Renn, Stephen D., ed., 2005, Hendrickson Publishers, Inc., {{ISBN|978-1-56563-938-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  “How I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts, which have turned away from me, and by their eyes, which have lusted after their idols.”&lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel 6:9; Tuell, Steven, ''The New International Bible Commentary: Ezekiel'', 2009, Hendrickson Publishers, Inc., p. 33, {{ISBN|978-1-85364-736-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This led to a broken covenant between Yahweh and Israel and “divorce,”&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 3:8; Ryken P.G. and Hughes R.K., ''Jeremiah and Lamentations: From Sorrow to Hope'', Chapter 3:God Files for Divorce, 2001, Crossway Publishers, {{ISBN|1-58134-167-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; manifested as defeat by [[King Nebuchadnezzar]] of Babylon followed by exile, from which the northern kingdom never recovered.

The Bible presents [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] and his companions as distinct, positive examples of individuals refusing to pay homage to another god, even at the price of their lives. During the time of the exile, Nebuchadnezzar erects a gold statue of himself and commands all subjects to worship it.  Three Jewish officials – [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]] – who had been taken to Babylon as youths along with Daniel, refuse to bow to the statue.  As they face being burned alive in a furnace, they communicate their faith as well as their resolve: “If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and he will rescue us from your hand, O king. But even if he does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel 3:17-18; Telushkin, Joseph, ''Jewish Literacy: The most important things to know about the Jewish religion, its people and its history'', 1991, William Morrow, {{ISBN|0-688-08506-7}} pp. 80-81&lt;/ref&gt; In the later reign of Darius, Daniel’s refusal to give up private prayer to God and pray to the king instead results in him receiving a death sentence: being thrown into the lions’ den.&lt;ref&gt;Dan’iel, in ''The New Unger’s Bible Dictionary'', 2006. Unger, Merrill F., Harrison, R.K., ed.  Chicago: Moody Publishers  {{ISBN|0-8024-9066-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[Book of Daniel]], an angel comes and shuts the mouths of the lions so that Daniel is spared and rescued by the king himself the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel 6; Walvoord J.F. and Zuck R. B.; ''The Bible Knowledge Commentary: Old Testament'', 1983, Colorado Springs:David C. Cook,  p. 1349, {{ISBN|978-0-88207-813-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Judaism ==
The central prayer of Judaism is the [[Shema]]:
{{quote|Hear you, Israel, Yahweh our God, Yahweh is one. | The Shema&lt;ref&gt;Shema, in ''The HarperCollins Bible Dictionary'', 1996, Achtemeier Paul J., ed., New York: HarperCollins Publishers Inc. {{ISBN|0-06-060037-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Together with “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart,” it is found in printed form in the [[Mezuzah]], the small, tubed case on the doorposts of homes of observant Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Philip S., ''What the Jews Believe'', 1951, New York: Farrar Straus and Young p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; This form was chosen to fulfill the mitzvah (Biblical commandment) to inscribe the words of the Shema "on the doorposts of your house.”&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 6:9; Kadden, Barbara Binder and Bruce, ''Teaching Mitzvot: Concepts, Values and Activities'', 2003, Denver: A.R.E. Publishing, Inc., {{ISBN|0-86705-080-2}}  p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; “Thousands of martyrs did not go to their deaths muttering a numerical truism. When they said that God is one, they meant that … nothing in the universe is comparable to this God or can take the place of this God … that is why they are willing to die rather than abandon [these values].”&lt;ref&gt;Seeskin,  Kenneth,  ''No Other Gods: the modern struggle against idolatry'', 1995, Behrman House,  {{ISBN|0-87441-583-7}} p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

The national resolve toward monotheism solidified during the experience of the [[Babylonian Captivity]]. The sorrow and difficulty experienced by the Israelites as a whole during the exile is poignantly expressed in Psalm 137. The hard times experienced during the exile are remembered annually on the ninth of [[Av]], when Jews fast and read aloud the scroll of Lamentations of Jeremiah regarding the destruction of Judah and the First Temple.&lt;ref&gt;Telushkin, Joseph, ''Jewish Literacy: The most important things to know about the Jewish religion, its people and its history'', 1991, William Morrow, {{ISBN|0-688-08506-7}} p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;  In the centuries that followed, Jews were willing to suffer death rather than pay the honor due God to any other man or god. During the early days of the Maccabean revolt, for example, many Jews were martyred because they refused to acknowledge the claims of Seleucid deities.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Lacey Baldwin, ''Fools, Martyrs, Traitors: the story of martyrdom in the western world'', Northwestern University Press, {{ISBN|0-8101-1724-X}} pp.49-50&lt;/ref&gt;  After [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] defeated Jerusalem in 167 BC, he forbade Torah and introduced worship of foreign gods into the [[Second Temple]], prompting a revolt by many of the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;''The Works of Flavius Josephus'', Volume I (War of the Jews), Book I.&lt;/ref&gt; Their success in reclaiming the Temple and the miraculous provision of oil for the celebratory services are remembered on the Jewish holiday [[Hanukkah]].&lt;ref&gt;Wylen, Stephen M., ''Settings of Silver: an introduction to Judaism'', 2000, Paulist Press, {{ISBN|0-8091-3960-X}} pp.175-176&lt;/ref&gt;

On the willows in its midst, we hung up our harps. &lt;br/&gt;
For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs. &lt;br/&gt;
Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy: &lt;br/&gt;
“Sing us one of the songs of Zion!” &lt;br/&gt;
How can we sing Yahweh’s song in a foreign land? &lt;br/&gt;
If I forget you, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill. &lt;br/&gt;

Idolatry is one of three sins (along with [[You shall not commit adultery|adultery]] and [[You shall not murder|murder]]) the [[Mishnah]] says must be resisted to the point of death.&lt;ref&gt;Sanhedrin 74a; Telushkin, Joseph, ''A Code of Jewish Ethics: You shall be holy'', 2006, Harmony/Bell Tower {{ISBN|1-4000-4835-4}}  pp 471-472&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time the [[Talmud]] was written, the acceptance or rejection of idolatry was a litmus test for Jewish identity:&lt;ref&gt;Seeskin, Kenneth, ''No Other Gods: the modern struggle against idolatry,'' 1995, Behrman House, {{ISBN|0-87441-583-7}} pp.14-15&lt;/ref&gt;  “Whosoever denies idols is called a Jew."&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Megilah 13&lt;/ref&gt; "Whosoever recognizes idols has denied the entire Torah; and whosoever denies idols has recognized the entire Torah."&lt;ref&gt;Midrash Sifre, Deuteronomy 54&lt;/ref&gt; The Talmud discusses the subject of the worship of other gods in many passages.  An entire tractate, the [[Avodah Zarah]] (“strange worship”) details practical guidelines for interacting with surrounding peoples so as to avoid practicing or even indirectly supporting such worship.&lt;ref&gt;Sicker, Martin, ''Between Man and God: Issues in Judaic thought'', 2001, Praeger, {{ISBN|0-313-31904-9}} pp.12-14&lt;/ref&gt; Although Jews are forbidden in general to mock at anything holy, it is meritorious to deride idols.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Megilah 25b&lt;/ref&gt; This apparently originated in ancient times, as some of the several Hebrew words from the Tanakh translated as “idol” are pejorative and even deliberately contemptuous, such as ''elilim'', “powerless ones,” and ''gillulim'', “pellets of dung.”&lt;ref&gt;Idol, in ''The HarperCollins Bible Dictionary'', 1996, Achtemeier Paul J., ed., New York: HarperCollins Publishers Inc. {{ISBN|0-06-060037-3}}; Idol, Image, in ''The New Unger’s Bible Dictionary'', 2006. Unger, Merrill F., Harrison, R.K., ed., Chicago: Moody Publishers, {{ISBN|0-8024-9066-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Jews have characteristically separated themselves from the worship of physical idols or persons claiming divinity since the Babylonian exile, the tendency toward and practice of magic arts (chants, spells, charms, amulets, healing devices, special foods, lucky and unlucky days, magical numbers and a vast array of secret rituals) has continued to be found among some who claim Judaism as their faith.&lt;ref&gt;Seeskin, Kenneth, ''No Other Gods: the modern struggle against idolatry'', 1995, Behrman House, {{ISBN|0-87441-583-7}} pp.37-44&lt;/ref&gt; This has been true since ancient times, when the Israelites, having spent 400 years in Egypt, where magic was pervasive, wrongly thought that carrying the [[Ark of the Covenant]] into battle would guarantee victory.&lt;ref&gt;1 Samuel 4; Bell J.S. and Campbell S, ''The Complete Idiot’s Guide to the Bible'', 2003, Indianapolis: Alpha Books, p. 103, {{ISBN|0-02-864382-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such practices, though forbidden, were not surprising since “the ancient Israelites were not immune to the desire to control God.”&lt;ref&gt;Seeskin, Kenneth, ''No Other Gods: the modern struggle against idolatry'', 1995, Behrman House, {{ISBN|0-87441-583-7}} p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Maimonides]] warned that special objects (e.g. a mezuzah) and prayers (e.g. the Shema) in Judaism are meant to remind people of love for God and his precepts and do not in themselves guarantee good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;Glustrom, Simon, ''The Myth and Reality of Judaism: 82 misconceptions set straight'', 1989, Behrman House Publishing, {{ISBN|0-87441-479-2}}, p. 131; Kadden, Barbara Binder and Bruce, ''Teaching Mitzvot: Concepts, Values and Activities'', 2003, Denver: A.R.E. Publishing, Inc., {{ISBN|0-86705-080-2}}  p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the New Testament ==
According to the gospels, Jesus said the greatest commandment was to “love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your mind.”&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 22:37-38, Mark 12:29-30, Luke 10:27-28; Milavec, Aaron, ''The Didache: Faith, Hope and Life of the Earliest Christian Communities 50-70 C.E.,'' 2003, The Newman Press,  pp. 65-66, {{ISBN|0-8091-0537-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scripture in [[Deuteronomy]] to which he referred is known in modern times as the [[Shema]], a declaration emphasizing the oneness of God and the sole worship of God by Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4-5; Bernstein, Philip S., ''What the Jews Believe'', 1951, New York: Farrar Straus and Young p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  In his [[Sermon on the Mount]], Jesus contrasted worship of God and running after material possessions and warned, “You cannot serve both God and money.”&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 6:24; Luke 16:13; Wiersbe, Warren, ''The Bible Exposition Commentary: New Testament, Volume 1'', 2001, Cook Communications, {{ISBN|1-56476-030-8}}, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], Stephen summarizes the spiritual history of Israel and quotes the prophet Amos, who identified the worship of foreign gods as a reason for Israel’s defeat by the Babylonians and subsequent exile.&lt;ref&gt;Amos 5:25-27; Pilch, J.J., ''Stephen: Paul and the Hellenist Israelites'', 2008, Liturgical Press, p. 13, {{ISBN|978-0-8146-5229-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in Acts, the apostles discussed the issue of what immediate behavioral changes would be required of [[gentiles]] who became followers of Jesus Christ.  They decided to instruct new converts: “You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality.”&lt;ref&gt;Acts 15:29, Acts 21:25; Tomson, Peter J., ''Paul and the Jewish Law: halakha in the Letters of the Apostle to the Gentiles'',  1990, Netherlands: Van Gorcum &amp; Comp., pp. 177-178, {{ISBN|90-232-2490-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Athens]], Paul was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols,&lt;ref&gt;Acts 17:16; Walvoord and Zuck, ''The Bible Knowledge Commentary: New Testament'', 1983, Colorado Springs: David C. Cook,  p. 402, {{ISBN|978-0-88207-812-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Areopagus]], he presented the god of Israel as the creator of everything, as unique and not represented by any idol.  He taught:
{{quote|Therefore since we are God's offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone—an image made by man's design and skill. In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to all men by raising him [Jesus] from the dead. | Acts 17:29-3 (NIV)}}

According to [[Ephesians]], Paul incurred the wrath of silversmiths (worried about losing income from decreased sales of idols) when people responded to his preaching and turned away from idol worship.&lt;ref&gt;Gods, False: Artemis, in ''The New Unger’s Bible Dictionary,'' 2006. Unger, Merrill F., Harrison, R.K., ed.  Chicago: Moody Publishers, {{ISBN|0-8024-9066-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul taught that Christians should actively avoid participating in the worship of anything other than God. He considered it common sense that the worship of God and the worship of any other spiritual being are incompatible:
{{quote|Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry. I speak to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say … Do I mean then that a sacrifice offered to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything? No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to be participants with demons. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord's table and the table of demons. Are we trying to arouse the Lord's jealousy? Are we stronger than he? | 1 Corinthians 10:14, 19-22 (NIV)}}

Paul warned the [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] that those who live in idolatry “will not inherit the kingdom of God,” and in the same passage associates witchcraft with idolatry.&lt;ref&gt;Galatians 5:19-21; ''Galatians: Luther'', McGrath A. and Packer J.I., eds., 1998, Wheaton: Crossway Books, p. 279,  {{ISBN|0-89107-994-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his letter to the [[Philippians]], he refers to those whose “god is their stomach.”&lt;ref&gt;Philippians 3:19; see also Romans 16:18, 2 Timothy 3:4, James 4:4; Hughes R.K., ''James: Faith that Works'', 1991, Wheaton: Crossway Books, pp. 175-176, {{ISBN|0-89107-627-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In several New Testament scriptures, including the [[Sermon on the Mount]], the term idolatry is applied to the love of money.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 6:24; Luke 16:13; Ephesians 5:5; Colossians 3:5; Idolatry: Figurative, in ''The New Unger’s Bible Dictionary'', 2006. Unger, Merrill F., Harrison, R.K., ed., Chicago: Moody Publishers, {{ISBN|0-8024-9066-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apostle [[Epistle of James|James]] rebukes those who focus on material things, using language similar to that of Old Testament prophets: “When you ask [in prayer], you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures. You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.”&lt;ref&gt;James 4:3-5 (NIV); Hughes R.K., ''James: Faith that Works'', 1991, Wheaton: Crossway Books, pp. 175-176, {{ISBN|0-89107-627-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul commended the church in [[Thessalonica]] saying, “Your faith in God has become known everywhere … They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead—Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.”&lt;ref&gt;1 Thessalonians 1:8-10; Green G.L., ''[[Pillar New Testament Commentary|The Pillar New Testament Commentaries]]: The Letters to the Thessalonians'', 2002, Grand Rapids: W.B. Eardmans Publishing Co.,  p. 106, {{ISBN|0-8028-3738-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Paul identifies the worship of created things (rather than the Creator) as the cause of the disintegration of sexual and social morality in his letter to the [[Book of Romans|Romans]].&lt;ref&gt;Romans 1:22-29; Dunn J.D.G., ''The Theology of Paul the Apostle'', 1998, Grand Rapids: William B. Eardmans Publishing Company, pp.33-34, {{ISBN|0-8028-3844-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The apostle [[First Epistle of Peter|Peter]] and the [[Book of Revelation]] also refer to the connection between the worship of other gods and sexual sins, whether metaphorically or literally.&lt;ref&gt;1 Peter 4:3-4; ''Life Application Bible Commentary:1 &amp; 2 Peter and Jude'', 1995, Galvin J.C. and Beers R.A., eds., The Livinstone Corporation, p. 112, {{ISBN|0-8423-3031-3}};  Revelation 2:14, 2:20; Trebilco P., ''The Early Christians in Ephesus from Paul to Ignatius'', 2004 (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck) and 2007 (W.B.

== In the Catholic Church ==
{{quote|God revealed Himself to His people Israel by making His name known to them … God has a name; He is not an anonymous force. | ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' 203}}

The [[Catholic Church]] teaches that the first commandment forbids honoring gods other than the one Lord who has revealed Himself, for example, in the introduction to the Ten Commandments: “I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of Egypt, where you lived as slaves.”&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 20:2 (NJB)&lt;/ref&gt; Through the prophets, God calls Israel and all nations to turn to him, the one and only God: "Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other. . . . To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. ‘Only in the LORD, it shall be said of me, are righteousness and strength.' (Isaiah 45:22-24, see also Philippians 2:10-11)”&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 201&lt;/ref&gt;

Because God’s identity and [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] character are described in Scripture as unique,&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 212&lt;/ref&gt; the teaching of the Catholic Church proscribes superstition as well as [[irreligion]] and explains the commandment is broken by having images to which divine power is ascribed as well as in [[Apotheosis|divinizing]] anything that is not God. “Man commits idolatry whenever he honors and reveres a creature in place of God, whether this be gods or demons … power, pleasure, race, ancestors, the state, money, etc.”&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 2113&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Catechism'' commends those who refuse even to simulate such worship in a cultural context&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2113&lt;/ref&gt; and states that “the duty to offer God authentic worship concerns man both as an individual and as a social being.”&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 2136&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' notes that this commandment is recalled many times throughout the Bible and quotes passages describing temporal consequences for those who place trust elsewhere than in God:

{{quote|Scripture constantly recalls this rejection of "idols, [of] silver and gold, the work of men's hands. They have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see." These empty idols make their worshippers empty: "Those who make them are like them; so are all who trust in them."(Psalm 115:4-5, 8; see also Isaiah 44:9-20; Jeremiah 10:1-16; Daniel 14:1-30). God, however, is the "living God" (Joshua 3:10; Psalm 42:3; etc.) who gives life and intervenes in history. | ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 2112}}

While recognizing that God communicates with people, including [[Prophets of Christianity|prophet]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 2215&lt;/ref&gt; the Catholic Catechism teaches that the first commandment forbids the practice of all attempts to tame occult powers as contradictory to the honor, respect and loving fear that is owed to God alone.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2116&lt;/ref&gt; Such practices are forbidden even if one has “good” motives, such as seeking to restore someone’s health, and “recourse to so-called traditional cures does not justify either the invocation of evil powers or the exploitation of another's credulity.”&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 2117&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|All forms of divination are to be rejected: recourse to Satan or demons, conjuring up the dead or other practices falsely supposed to "unveil" the future (see for example, Deuteronomy 18:10; Jeremiah 29:8). Consulting horoscopes, astrology, palm reading, interpretation of omens and lots, the phenomena of clairvoyance, and recourse to mediums all conceal a desire for power over time, history, and, in the last analysis, other human beings, as well as a wish to conciliate hidden powers. | ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 2116}}

Irreligion, in the specific forms of tempting God, [[sacrilege]], and [[simony]], is also considered a violation of the first commandment.&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 2118&lt;/ref&gt; The Catechism states that [[atheism]] is often based on a “false conception of human autonomy”&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 2126&lt;/ref&gt; and all forms of atheism are viewed as violating the first commandment in their common denial of the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 2123- 2126, 2140&lt;/ref&gt; Agnosticism as a way of life is portrayed as a lazy flight from the ultimate question of existence and as “all too often equivalent of practical atheism.”&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 2128&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reformation and Post-Reformation commentary ==
[http://www.theopedia.com/G._Campbell_Morgan Rev. G. Campbell Morgan] emphasized the importance of the first commandment being given after Yahweh introduces Himself by name, saying, “There is deep significance in the name by which God here declares Himself … to take [the commandment] without the definition of the Person of God is to rob it of its great force.”&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, G. Campbell, ''The Ten Commandments'', 1901, Fleming H. Revell Company,  pp.16-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan argues that everyone has “a center, a motive, a reason, a shrine, a deity somewhere” to which his or her energy and loyalty is directed.  “In every case man demands a god, a king, a lawgiver – one who arranges the programme, utters the commandments and demands obedience. This incontrovertible fact reveals the genesis of idolatry.”&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, G. Campbell, ''The Ten Commandments'', 1901, Fleming H. Revell Company,  p.19&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan goes on to argue that thus “idolatry” is not defined by geography or culture but by the object(s) of worship that are not God, which may be spiritual or physical.

[[Martin Luther]], [[Matthew Henry]], [[John Calvin]], and [[John Wesley]] write in their respective commentaries that in the commandment to have no other gods, God is referring to the heart’s allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/luther/largecatechism.i_2.html Martin Luther, The Large Catechism, Part First: The Ten Commandments, The First Commandment]; Commentary on Exodus 20, ''Matthew Henry’s Commentary on the Whole Bible''; Commentary on the First Commandment; John Calvin, ''Harmony of the Law:Part 1, The Law: The First Commandment''; ''John Wesley’s Notes on the Bible'', Notes on the Second Book of Moses called Exodus, Exodus XX&lt;/ref&gt; In Luther’s exposition of this commandment, he explains:

{{quote|[Idolatry] consists not merely in erecting an image and worshiping it, but rather in the heart, which stands gaping at something else, and seeks help and consolation from creatures, saints, or devils, and neither cares for God, nor looks to Him for so much good as to believe that He is willing to help, neither believes that whatever good it experiences comes from God.| Martin Luther&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/luther/catechism/web/cat-03.html  ''The Large Catechism'' III, Part First: The First Commandment], Translated by F. Bente and W.H.T. Dau
Published in: Triglot Concordia: The Symbolical Books of the Ev. Lutheran Church, St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1921, pp. 565-773&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Like the ancient writers and Jewish theologians (see above), Luther considered occult or magic practices to be in violation of this commandment, explaining that those who seek benefit in such ways “make a covenant with the devil, in order that he may give them plenty of money or help them in love-affairs, preserve their cattle, restore to them lost possessions, etc. For all these place their heart and trust elsewhere than in the true God, look for nothing good to Him nor seek it from Him.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/luther/catechism/web/cat-03.html  ''The Large Catechism'' III, Part First: The First Commandment] , Translated by F. Bente and W.H.T. Dau
Published in: Triglot Concordia: The Symbolical Books of the Ev. Lutheran Church, St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1921, pp. 565-773&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the New Testament writers, Morgan recognized that departing from the worship of God alone is frequently associated with sexual immorality: “’Tis the homage of the man who, losing his God, worships at the shrine of a fallen Venus.”&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, G. Campbell, ''The Ten Commandments'', 1901, Fleming H. Revell Company,  p.20&lt;/ref&gt; He references Philippians 3:18-19 to support that gluttony and the pursuit of physical pleasure are also widespread, but not new, examples of idolatry.

Calvin recalls Moses’ warning to the people of Israel, “Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are round about you,” and notes that this commandment was given despite the abundant temptation to superstitions in the cultures all around them and the lack of good examples.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 18:9; Commentary on Deuteronomy 18:9, John Calvin, ''Harmony of the Law: Part 1, The Law: The First Commandment''&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, he explains that it is not enough that followers of Yahweh put him first, while giving lesser respect to other superstitions or objects of worship.

{{quote|We know that when the Israelites worshipped their Baalim, they did not so substitute them in the place of God as to put Him altogether aside, and assign to them the supreme power; nevertheless, this was an intolerable profanation of God’s worship. | John Calvin&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, Harmony of the Law: Part 1, The Law: The First Commandment&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the first and second of his ''Quatre Sermons'', Calvin also discouraged believers in Christ from simulating religious acts that are not worship of the true God in order to avoid persecution.  He argued that the growth of the Christian church was based on the “seeds sown” by those who were willing to die, if necessary, rather than worship or appear to worship false gods and that without such people there would never have been a Christian church.   He said that if one makes choices to suffer nothing for God’s word, one changes Jesus Christ to his own image: “Is that not to want to transform Jesus Christ to have him just as our flesh would like him to be?”  [[Pierre Viret]], a Swiss Reformed theologian and contemporary of John Calvin, made similar arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Shepardson, Nikki, ''Burning zeal: the rhetoric of martyrdom and the Protestant community in Reformation France 1520–1570'', 2007, Associated University Presses, {{ISBN|978-0-934223-87-4}}, pp. 138-140&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Reformers such as Viret and Calvin imbued these decisions with social consciousness: choice of behavior had communal repercussions ranging from providing bad examples and leading others to the same sin, to bringing about God’s ire upon them all, bringing physical harm upon others, and finally to undermining the efforts of the martyrs. | Shepardson&lt;ref&gt;Shepardson, Nikki, ''Burning zeal: the rhetoric of martyrdom and the Protestant community in Reformation France 1520–1570'', 2007, Associated University Presses,  {{ISBN|978-0-934223-87-4}}, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Neither Calvin nor Viret advocated reckless martyrdom or purposeful public disturbance, but to the extent possible, to make public choices with “Christian modesty,” even recommending that leaving an area (self-imposed exile) is sometimes the most realistic response to persecution when resources permit.&lt;ref&gt;Shepardson, Nikki, ''Burning zeal: the rhetoric of martyrdom and the Protestant community in Reformation France 1520–1570'', 2007, Associated University Presses,  {{ISBN|978-0-934223-87-4}} p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu scriptures are classified into two parts: [[shruti]] or ''śruti'', meaning what has been heard and [[smriti]], or ''smṛti'', meaning what has been retained or remembered. The [[Vedas]] are classified under ''śruti''.

The following list provides a somewhat common set of reconstructed dates for the ''terminus ante quem'' of [[Hindu texts]], by title or genre.  All dates here given ought to be regarded as roughly approximate, subject to further revision, and generally as relying for their validity on highly inferential methods and standards of evidence.

*''[[Arthashastra]]'', 400 BCE - 200 CE&lt;ref&gt;Trautmann 1971:185 "If the ''Kautilīya Arthaśāstra'' in its present form is not so old as it pretends, the ''śāstra'' itself is certainly old, predating the ''dharma smritis''."&lt;br&gt;Mabbett 1964 "The content of the text is consistent with authorship in about the third century, C.E., and raises some questions which must be answered if it is to be assigned to the fourth B.C.E. Against this must be set the verses naming and characterising Kautilya, and the references in later literature. What emerges is that there is no necessary incompatibility between the essential claims that Chanakya was responsible for the doctrines of the Arthaśāstra, and that the text we know is a product of the later time. These do not conflict. The work could have been written late on the basis of earlier teachings and writings. Sanskrit literature being so full of derivative, traditional and stratified material, this possibility is ''a priori'' strong. Those who favour the early date usually admit the probability of interpolations....Those who favour a later date usually admit the probability that the work draws on traditional material.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21642">The '''traditional Berber religion''' is the ancient and native set of beliefs and deities adhered to by the [[Berbers|Berber]] [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|autochthones]] of [[North Africa]]. Many ancient Berber beliefs were developed locally, whereas others were influenced over time through contact with other [[traditional African religion]]s (such as the [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]), or borrowed during antiquity from the [[religion in Carthage|Punic religion]], [[Judaism]], [[Spanish mythology|Iberian mythology]], and the [[Hellenistic religion]]. The most recent influence came from [[Islam]] and [[religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arab religion]] during the medieval period. Some of the ancient Berber beliefs still exist today subtly within the Berber popular culture and tradition. Syncretic influences from the traditional Berber religion can also be found in certain other faiths.

==Funerary practices==
[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] research on prehistoric tombs in the Maghreb shows that the bodies of the dead were painted with [[ochre]]. While this practice was known to the [[Iberomaurusian]]s, this culture seems to have been primarily a [[Capsian culture|Capsian]] industry. The dead were also sometimes buried with shells of [[ostrich]] eggs, [[jewelry]], and [[weapon]]s. Bodies were usually buried in a [[fetal position]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ouachi, Moustapha. “The Berbers and the death.” ''El-Haraka''&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the majority of mainland Berbers, the [[Guanches]] mummified the dead. Additionally, Savino di Lernia discovered a Libyan [[mummy]] older than any comparable Ancient Egyptian mummy in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fulcrumtv.com/program.php?id=109&amp;cat=factual&amp;subcat=documentaries&amp;year=2003 The mystery of the Black Mummy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult of the dead==
The authors of the book ''The Berbers'' stated that the cult of the dead was one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Berbers in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Brett, Michael, and Elizabeth Fentress. 1996. ''The Berbers''. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pomponius Mela]] reported that the Augilae (Modern [[Awjila]] in [[Libya]]) considered the spirits of their ancestors to be gods. They swore by them and consulted them. After making requests, they slept in their tombs to await responses in dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Brett, Michael, and Elizabeth Fentress p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] (484 BC–ca.425 BC) noted the same practice among the [[Nasamones]], who inhabited the deserts around [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] and Augila.  He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[..]They swear by the men among themselves who are reported to have been the most righteous and brave, by these, I say, laying hands upon their tombs; and they divine by visiting the sepulchral mounds of their ancestors and lying down to sleep upon them after having prayed; and whatsoever thing the man sees in his dream, this he accepts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh4170.htm Herodotus, ''Histories'', Book 4, 170]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Berbers worshiped their kings, too.&lt;ref&gt;James Hastings, [[Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics]] Part 4 - p. 512&lt;/ref&gt; The tombs of the Numidian kings are among the most notable monuments left by the Classical Berbers.

The veneration (not worship) of [[saint]]s which exists among the modern Berbers in the form of [[Marabout]]ism—which is widespread in northwest Africa—may or may not contain traces of prior beliefs or customs concerning the dead.

==Ancient Berber tombs==
[[File:Imedghasen.jpg|thumb|The [[mausoleum]] of [[Madghacen]]]]
The [[tomb]]s of the early people and their ancestors indicate that the Berbers and their forebears (the [[Numidians]] and [[Mauretania]]ns) believed in an [[afterlife]]. The prehistoric people of northwest Africa buried bodies in little holes. When they realized that bodies buried in unsecured holes were dug up by wild animals, they began to bury them in deeper ones. Later, they buried the dead in caves, tumuli, tombs in rocks, mounds, and other types of tombs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

These tombs evolved from primitive structures to much more elaborate ones, such as the [[pyramid]]al tombs spread throughout Northern Africa. The honor of being buried in such a tomb appears to have been reserved for those who were most important to their communities.

These pyramid tombs have attracted the attention of some scholars, such as [[Mohamed Chafik]] who wrote a book discussing the history of several of the tombs that have survived into modern times. He tried to relate the pyramidal Berber tombs with the great [[Egyptian pyramids]] on the basis of the etymological and historical data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tawalt.com/monthly/hafriat_shafeeq.pdf Tawalt, Libyan Massyle Site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102162821/http://www.tawalt.com/monthly/hafriat_shafeeq.pdf |date=2007-01-02 }} {{ar icon}}, Chafik, Mohammed. ''Revue Tifinagh. Elements lexicaux Berberes pouvant apporter un eclairage dans la recherche des origines prehistoriques des pyramides''&lt;!-- place of publication and publisher needed, as well as page numbers for this text --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; The  best known Berber pyramids are the 19-meter pre-Roman Numidian pyramid of the Medracen and the 30-meter [[Mauretania|ancient Mauretanian]] pyramid.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Chafik, Mohammed. ''Revue Tifinagh. Elements lexicaux Berberes pouvant apporter un eclairage dans la recherche des origines prehistoriques des pyramides&lt;!-- place of publication and publisher needed, as well as page numbers for this text --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Numidian pyramid in Tipaza is also known as [[Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania|Kbour-er-Roumia]] or ''Tomb of Juba and Sypax'', mistranslated by the French colonists as ''Tomb of the Christian Woman''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The Tomb holds the graves of King [[Juba II]] and Queen [[Cleopatra Selene II]], sovereigns of Mauretania.

==Megalithic culture==
[[Augustine of Hippo]] mentioned that the polytheistic [[Africa (Roman province)|Africans]] worshipped the rocks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;. “The Berbers and rocks.”&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Apuleius]] stated as well that rocks were worshipped in the second century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The megalithic culture may have been part of a cult of the dead or of star-worship.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

The monument of [[Msoura]] is the best-known megalithic monument in northwest Africa. It is composed of a circle of megaliths surrounding a [[tumulus]]. The highest megalith is longer than 5 meters. According to legend, it is the sepulchre of the mythical Berber king [[Antaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minculture.gov.ma/fr/Tertre%20de%20Mzora.htm Tertre de M'zora] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040624040440/http://www.minculture.gov.ma/fr/Tertre%20de%20Mzora.htm |date=2004-06-24 }} {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another megalithic monument was discovered in 1926 to south of [[Casablanca]]. The monument was engraved with funerary inscriptions in the Berber script known as [[Tifinagh]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

[[Herodotus]] mentioned that the ancient Berbers  worshipped the [[moon]] and [[sun]] and sacrificed to them. He reported:
{{quote|They begin with the ear of the victim, which they cut off and throw over their house: this done, they kill the animal by twisting the neck. They sacrifice to the Sun and Moon, but not to any other god. This worship is common to all the Libyans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/herod-libya1.html Herodotus, ''Histories'', book IV, 168–198].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tullius [[Cicero]] (105-43 BC) also reported the same cult in ''On the Republic (Scipio's Dream)'':
{{quote|When I ([[Scipio Aemilianus|Scipio]]) was introduced to him, the old man ([[Masinissa|Massinissa]], king of [[Massylii|Massyle]]) embraced me, shed tears, and then, looking up to heaven, exclaimed I thank thee, O supreme Sun, and you also, you other celestial beings, that before I departed from this life I behold in my kingdom, and in my palace, Publius Cornelius Scipio ....&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/HALSALL/ANCIENT/cicero-republic6.html M. Tullius Cicero (105-43 BCE): from On the Republic (Scipio's Dream)].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There were some Latin inscriptions found in Northwest Africa dedicated to the sun-god. An example is the inscription found in [[Souk Ahras]] (the birthplace of Augustine; [[Thagaste]] in [[Algeria]]) written "[[Sol Invictus|Solo Deo Invicto]]".&lt;ref&gt;James Hastings, Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics Part 4 p. 508.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Samuel the Confessor]] appears to have suffered from the sun-worshiping Berbers who tried unsuccessfully to force him to worship the sun.

The Berber pantheon also contained multiple gods, known as the Dii Mauri, represented on reliefs and also the subject of dedications.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Fentress, 1978, 'Di Mauri and Dii Patrii' Latomus 37, 2-16&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Roman period, [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] was the focus of an important cult, subsuming that of [[Baal Hammon]], a deity of Punic origin.

==Berber-Egyptian beliefs==
The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians were the neighbors of the Berbers. Therefore, it is sometimes supposed that some [[ancient Egyptian deities|deities]] were originally worshipped by the Ancient Egyptians and the Ancient Libyans (Berbers) as well. The Egyptian-Berber gods and goddesses can be distinguished according to their origin.

===Egyptian deities===
The Eastern ancient Berbers worshipped [[Isis]] and [[Set (mythology)|Set]]. That was reported by Herodotus when saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Cow's flesh, however, none of these [Libyan] tribes ever taste, but abstain from it for the same reason as the Egyptians, neither do they any of them breed swine. Even at Cyrene, the women think it wrong to eat the flesh of the cow, honoring in this Isis, the Egyptian goddess, whom they worship both with fasts and festivals. The Barcaean women abstain, not from cow's flesh only, but also from the flesh of swine.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus: The Histories.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those Berbers supposedly did not eat the flesh of swine, because it was associated with ''[[Set (mythology)|Set]]'', while they did not eat the cow's flesh, because it was associated with Isis.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Mustapha Bazma, ''The Libyan Influence on the Egyptian and Greek Civilizations and their Influence on the Libyan Civilization''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Osiris]] was among the Egyptian deities who were venerated in Libya. However, Dr. Budge (in addition to a few other scholars) believed that Osiris was originally a Libyan god saying of him that "Everything which the texts of all periods recorded concerning him goes to show that he was an indigenous god of North-east Africa, and that his home and origin were possibly Libyan."&lt;ref&gt;Cited by [[Lewis Spence]] in ''Ancient Egyptian Myths and Legends''; p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berber deities===
The Egyptians considered some Egyptian deities to have had a [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] origin, such as [[Neith]] who has been considered, by Egyptians, to have emigrated from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] to establish her temple at [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]] in the Nile Delta. Some legends tell that Neith was born around Lake Tritons (in modern [[Libya]]).

It is also notable that some Egyptian deities were depicted with Berber (ancient Libyan) characters. The goddess [[Ament (goddess)|Ament]] was thus portrayed with two feathers, which were the normal ornaments of the Ancient Libyans as they were drawn by the Ancient Egyptians.

===Ammon as a common deity===
The most remarkable common god of the Berbers and the Egyptians was [[Amun|Ammon]].&lt;ref name="Shaler1824"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Shaler|title=Communication on the language, manners, and customs of the Berbers or Brebers of Africa, in a series of letters to P.S. Duponceau, read before the Amer. phil. soc. and publ. in the new ser. of their transactions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RKEOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA18|year=1824|pages=18–|authormask=|trans-title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This god is hard to attribute to only one [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]]. Although most modern sources ignore the existence of Ammon in Berber mythology, he was maybe the greatest ancient Berber god.&lt;ref&gt;H. Basset, Les influences puniques chez les Berbères, pp 367-368&lt;/ref&gt; He was honored by the Ancient Greeks in Cyrenaica, and was united with the Phoenician god [[Baal]] due to Libyan influence.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Chafik, Revue Tifinagh...&lt;/ref&gt; Early depictions of [[Sheep|rams]] (related possibly to an early form of the cult of this deity) across North Africa have been dated to between [[9th millennium BC|9600 BC]] and 7500 BC.&lt;br /&gt;
The most famous temple of Ammon in Ancient Libya was the augural temple at [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] in Egypt, an oasis still inhabited by Berbers.

==Phoenician-Berber beliefs==
The [[Phoenicia]]ns were originally a [[Semitic people]] that inhabited the coasts of modern [[Lebanon]] and [[Tunisia]]. They were [[seafarer]]s and they founded [[Carthage]] in 814 BC. They later gave birth to the so-called ''Punic culture'' which had its roots in the Berber and Phoenician cultures. Some scholars distinguish the relationships between the Phoenicians and the Berbers in two phases:

===Before the Battle of Himera (480 BC)===
When the Phoenicians established in Northwest Africa, they stayed in the coastal regions to avoid wars with the Berbers. They maintained their deities which they brought from their homelands. The early Carthaginians had two important deities, ''[[Baal]]'' and ''[[Astarte]]''.

===After the Battle of Himera===
Carthage began to ally with the Berber tribes after the [[Battle of Himera (480 BC)|Battle of Himera]], in which the Carthaginians were defeated by the Greeks. In addition to political changes, the Carthaginians imported some of the Berber deities.

Baal was the primary god worshipped in Carthage. Depictions of this deity are found in several sites across northwest Africa. The goddess [[Astarte]] was replaced by a native goddess, ''[[Tanit]]'', which is thought to be of Berber origin. The name itself, ''Tanit'', has a Berber linguistic structure. Feminine names begin and end with "t" in the [[Berber languages]].
Some scholars believe that the Egyptian goddess [[Neith]] was related to the Libyan goddess Tanit (Ta-neith). There are also Massyle and Phoenician names that apparently contain roots from the god ''Baal'', such as ''[[Adherbal (disambiguation)|Adherbal]]''&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; and ''[[Hannibal]]''.

==Greek-Berber beliefs==
The ancient Greeks established colonies in [[Cyrenaica]]. The Greeks influenced the eastern Berber pantheon, but they were also influenced by Berber culture and beliefs.
Generally, the Libyan-Greek relationships can be divided into two different periods. In the first period, the Greeks had peaceful relationships with the Libyans. Later, there were wars between them. These social relationships were mirrored in their beliefs.

===Before the Battle of Irassa (570 BC)===
The first notable appearance of Libyan influence on the Cyrenaican-Greek beliefs is the name ''Cyrenaica'' itself. This name was originally the name of a legendary (mythic) Berber woman warrior who was known as ''Cyre''. Cyre was, according to the legend, a courageous lion-hunting woman. She gave her name to the city ''[[Cyrenaica]]''. The emigrating Greeks made her their protector besides their Greek god [[Apollo]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Freeman Greek city state- N.Y. 1983, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks of Cyrenaica seemed also to have adopted some Berber customs  and intermarried with the Berber women. Herodotus (Book IV 120) reported that the Libyans taught the Greeks how to yoke four horses to a chariot. The Cyrenaican Greeks built temples for the Libyan god Ammon instead of their original god [[Zeus]]. They later identified their supreme god [[Zeus]] with the Libyan Ammon.&lt;ref&gt;Oric Bates, The Eastern Libyans.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them continued worshipping Ammon himself.
Ammon's cult was so widespread among the Greeks that even [[Alexander the Great]] decided to be declared as the son of Zeus in the [[Siwa Oasis|Siwan]] temple by the Libyan priests of Ammon.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Chafik, revue Tifinagh...&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient historians mentioned that some Greek deities were of Libyan origin. The daughter of Zeus [[Athena]] was considered by some ancient historians, like Herodotus, to have been of Libyan origin. Those ancient historians stated that she was originally honored by the Berbers around [[Lake Tritonis]] where she had been born from the god [[Poseidon]] and Lake Tritonis, according to the Libyan [[legend]]. Herodotus wrote that the [[Aegis]] and the clothes of Athena are typical for Libyan woman.

Herodotus also stated that Poseidon (an important Greek [[water deity|sea god]]) was adopted from the Libyans by the Greeks. He emphasized that no other people worshipped Poseidon from early times apart from the Libyans who spread his cult:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[..]these I think received their naming from the Pelasgians, except Poseidon; but about this god the Hellenes learnt from the Libyans, for no people except the Libyans have had the name of Poseidon from the first and have paid honour to this god always.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh2050.htm Herodotus Book 2: Euterpe 50]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some other Greek deities were related to [[ancient Libya|Libya]]. The goddess [[Lamia (mythology)|Lamia]] was believed to have originated in Libya, like [[Medusa]] and the [[Gorgons]]. The Greeks seem also to have met the god [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] in Libya.
The Greeks may have believed that the [[Hesperides]] was situated in modern Morocco. Some scholars situate it in Tangier where Antaeus lived, according to some myths. The Hesperides were believed to be the daughters of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] a god that is associated with the [[Atlas mountains]] by Herodotus. The Atlas mountain was worshipped by the Berbers and the Canary Islands represent to many the daughters of Atlas.

===After the Battle of Irassa===
The Greeks and the Massyle began to break their harmony in the period of [[Battus II of Cyrene]]. Battus II began secretly to invite other Greek groups to Libya, Tunisia and East Algeria. The Libyans and Massyle considered that as a danger that had to be stopped. The Berbers began to fight against the Greeks, sometimes in alliance with the Egyptians and other times with the Carthaginians. Nevertheless, the Greeks were the victors.
[[File:Antaeus &amp; Heracles (Nordisk familjebok).jpg|thumb|260px|right|&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;[[Antaeus]] is depicted with long hair and beard, contrary to [[Heracles]].&lt;/span&gt;]]
Some historians believe that the myth of [[Antaeus]] was a reflection of those wars between the Libyans and Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Oric Bates. The Eastern Massyle, Franc Cass Co. p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;
The legend tells that Antaeus was the undefeatable protector of the Massyle. He was the son of the god Poseidon and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. He was the husband of the Berber goddess [[Tinjis]]. He used to protect the lands of the Berbers until he was slain by the Greek hero [[Heracles]] who married Tingis. The learned client king [[Juba II of Mauretania]] (died 23 BC), husband of the daughter of Antony and Cleopatra, claimed his descent from a liaison of Hercules with Tinga, the consort of Antaeus. 
Some sources describe  Antaeus as the king of Irassa, [[Plutarch]] reported that his son founded Tingi ([[Tangiers]]) after his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 9. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek [[iconography]], Antaeus was clearly distinguished as being different from the Greeks in appearance. He was depicted with long hair and a beard that was typical for the Eastern Libyans.

==Roman-Berber beliefs==
The Romans allied firstly with the Massyle against Carthage. They defeated Carthage in 146 BC. But later, they also annexed Massyle to the [[Roman Empire]].

=== The Imperial Period===

According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the Libyans honored the war goddess [[Ifri]] or ''Africa'', who was considered to be the protector of her worshipers (and seemed to have been an influential goddess in North Africa), and depicted her on the Berber coins. This goddess was represented in diverse ways on Numidian coins from the first century BC.
When the Romans conquered Northwest Africa, she appeared in sculpture and on the [[coin]]s of the Roman states in North Africa.

The Roman pantheon seems to have been adopted generally, although the cult of Saturn, as mentioned above, was perhaps the most important.

A new god appears in later texts, identified with tribes such as the Austuriani outside the Roman frontiers of Libya. Gurzil was a war god who identified with the son of Ammon. He was taken by the Berbers to their battles against the Byzantines. Corippus mentioned that the chiefs of the Laguata took their god ''Gurzil'' into battle against the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and [[Arabs]]. It is very likely that the sanctuary of Gurzil was located in Ghirza, in Libya, where remarkable reliefs show a noble Libyan receiving tribute while seated on a curule chair.&lt;ref&gt;O. Brogan and D. Smith, 1984, Ghirza: a Libyan Settlement in the Roman Period. Tripoli.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avatars of Vishnu.jpg|thumb|[[Vishnu]] showing his [[vishvarupa]] universal form to [[Arjuna]] before the [[Kurukshetra War]].]]
'''Vaishnavism''' (''Vaishnava dharma'') is one of the major [[Hindu denominations|traditions]] within [[Hinduism]] along with [[Shaivism]], [[Shaktism]], and [[Smartism|Smarthism]].

The tradition is notable for its [[avatar]] doctrine, wherein Vishnu is revered in one of many distinct incarnations. Of these, [[Dashavatara|ten avatars]] of Vishnu are the most studied.

==History==
[[File:Indischer Maler um 1660 002.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Krishna with Gopis]]
{{Main|Historical Vishnuism}}

Vaishnavism originates in the latest centuries BCE and the early centuries CE, as an amalgam of the heroic [[Krishna Vasudeva]], the "divine child" [[Bala Krishna]] of the [[Gopal (Krishna)|Gopala]] traditions, and syncretism of these non-Vedic traditions with the [[Mahabharata]] canon, thus affiliating itself with [[Vedism]] in order to become acceptable to the [[astika|orthodox]] establishment. Krishnaism becomes associated with [[bhakti yoga]] in the medieval period.{{refn|group=note|name="Klostermaier-Krishna"|Klostermaier: "Present day Krishna worship is an amalgam of various elements. According to historical testimonies [[Krishna-Vasudeva]] worship already flourished in and around Mathura several centuries before Christ. A second important element is the sect of Krishna Govinda. Still later is the worship of Bala-Krishna, the Divine Child Krishna - a quite prominent feature of modern Krishnaism. The last element seems to have been Krishna Gopijanavallabha, Krishna the lover of the Gopis, among whom [[Radha]] occupies a special position. In some books Krishna is presented as the founder and first teacher of the Bhagavata religion."{{sfn|Klostermaier|2007}}}}

Although ''Vishnu'' was a Vedic solar deity,&lt;ref name = ucsm/&gt; he is mentioned less often compared to Agni, Indra, and other Vedic deities, thereby suggesting that he had a minor position in the Vedic religion.{{sfn|Dandekar|1977|p=9498}} Other scholars state that there are other Vedic deities, such as water deity Nara (also mentioned as Narayana-Purusha in the Brahmanas layer of the Vedas), who together form the historical roots of Vaishnavism.&lt;ref name="Preciado-Solís1984p1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamín Preciado-Solís|title=The Kṛṣṇa Cycle in the Purāṇas: Themes and Motifs in a Heroic Saga|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvCaWvjGDVEC |year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-0-89581-226-1 |pages=1–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late-Vedic texts (~1000 to 500 BCE), the concept of a metaphysical [[Brahman]] grows in prominence, and the Vaishnavism tradition considered Vishnu to be identical to Brahman, just like Shaivism and Shaktism consider Shiva and Devi to be Brahman respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William K.

The ancient emergence of Vaishnavism is unclear, the evidence inconsistent and scanty.&lt;ref name="Preciado-Solís1984p1"/&gt; According to Dalal, the origins may be in Vedic deity ''Bhaga'', who gave rise to Bhagavatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNmfdAKFpkQC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-341517-6 |pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Preciado-Solís, the Vedic deities ''Nara'' and Narayana form one of the Vedic roots of Vaishnavism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamín Preciado-Solís|title=The Krishna Cycle in the Purāṇas: Themes and Motifs in a Heroic Saga|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvCaWvjGDVEC |year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-0-89581-226-1 |pages=6–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dandekar, Vaishnavism may have emerged from merger of several ancient theistic traditions, where the various deities were integrated as different avatars of the same god. In Dandekar theory, Vaishnavism emerged at the end of the Vedic period, closely before the [[History of India#"Second urbanization" (500–200 BCE)|second urbanisation]] of northern India, in the 7th to 4th century BCE. [[Vasudeva]] and [[Krishna]], "the deified tribal hero and religious leader of the [[Yaduvanshi|Yadavas]],"{{sfn|Dandekar|1977|p=9499}}&lt;ref name=ucsm&gt;{{cite web |url =http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/hindu/devot/vaish.html |title =Vaishnava |publisher =philtar.ucsm.ac.uk |accessdate =2008-05-22 |archive-url =https://www.webcitation.org/65DKpKa9B?url=http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/hindu/devot/vaish.html |archive-date =5 February 2012 |dead-url =yes |df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; gained prominence, merged into ''[[Krishna Vasudeva|Bhagavan Vasudeva-Krishna]]'',{{sfn|Dandekar|1977|p=9499}} due to the close relation between the Vrsnis and the Yadavas.{{sfn|Dandekar|1977|p=9499}}

This was followed by a merger with the cult of ''[[Bala Krishna|Gopala-Krishna]]'' of the cowherd community of the Abhıras{{sfn|Dandekar|1977|p=9499}} at the 4th century CE.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=120}} The character of [[Gopala Krishna]] is often considered to be non-Vedic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar]], Ramchandra Narayan Dandekar |title= Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar as an Indologist: A Symposium |publisher= Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute|location=India |year= 1976 |pages= 38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dandekar, such mergers consolidated the position of Krishnaism between the heterodox sramana movement and the orthodox Vedic religion.{{sfn|Dandekar|1977|p=9499}} The "Greater Krsnaism", states Dandekar, then merged with the [[Historical Vishnuism|Rigvedic Vishnu]].{{sfn|Dandekar|1977|p=9499}}

Syncretism of various traditions and Vedism resulted in Vaishnavism.{{sfn|Gonda|1993|p=163}}{{sfn|Klostermaier|2007|pp=206-217, 251-252}} At this stage that Vishnu of the [[Rig Veda]] was assimilated into non-Vedic Krishnaism and became the equivalent of the Supreme God.&lt;ref name = ucsm/&gt; The appearance of Krishna as one of the ''[[Avatar]]s'' of Vishnu dates to the period of the [[Sanskrit epics]] in the early centuries CE.

Finally, the Narayana-cult was also included, which further brahmanized Vaishnavism.{{sfn|Dandekar|1977|p=9500}} The Nara-Narayana cult may have originated in Badari, a northern ridge of the Hindu Kush, and absorbed into the Vedic orthodoxy as Purusa Narayana.{{sfn|Dandekar|1977|p=9500}} Purusa Narayana may have later been turned into Arjuna and Krsna.{{sfn|Dandekar|1977|p=9500}}

This complex history is reflected in the two main historical denominations of Vishnavism. The [[Krishnaism|Bhagavats]], worship Vasudeva-Krsna, and are followers of brahmanic Vaishnavism, while the Pacaratrins regard Narayana as their founder, and are followers of Tantric Vaishnavism.{{sfn|Dandekar|1977|p=9500}}

Devotion to southern Indian Mal ([[Tirumal]]) may be an early form of Krishnaism, since Mal appears as a divine figure, largely like Krishna with some elements of Vishnu.&lt;ref name=mal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/hindu/ascetic/mal.html |title=Devotion to Mal (Mayon) |publisher=philtar.ucsm.ac.uk |accessdate=2008-05-22 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65DKjmPOI?url=http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/hindu/ascetic/mal.html |archive-date=5 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alvar]]s, whose name can be translated "sages" or "saints", were devotees of Mal. Their poems show a pronounced orientation to the Vaishnava, and often Krishna, side of Mal. But they do not make the distinction between [[Krishna]] and [[Vishnu]] on the basis of the concept of the [[Avatar]]s.&lt;ref name = mal/&gt; Yet, according to Hardy the term "Mayonism" should be used instead of "Krishnaism" when referring to Mal or Mayon.&lt;ref name = Hardy/&gt;

===Gupta era===
Most of the Gupta kings, beginning with [[Chandragupta II]] (Vikramaditya) (375-413 CE) were known as Parama Bhagavatas or [[Bhagavata]] [[Vaishnavas]].{{sfn|Ganguli|1988||p=36}}{{sfn|Dandekar|1977|p=9500}}

===Early medieval period===
{{Main|Alvars}}
After the Gupta age, Krishnaism rose to a major current of Vaishnavism,{{sfn|Klostermaier|2007}} and Vaishnavism developed into various sects and subsects, most of them emphasizing ''bhakti'', which was strongly influenced by south Indian religiosity.{{sfn|Dandekar|1977|p=9500}}

Vaishnavism in the 8th century came into contact with the [[Advaita]] doctrine of [[Adi Shankara]]. Many of the early Vaishnava scholars such as Nathamuni, Yamunacharya and Ramanuja, contested the Advaita Vedanta doctrines and proposed Vishnu bhakti ideas instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= S.

The temples that the Alvars visited or founded are now known as [[Divya Desams]]. Their poems in praise of [[Vishnu]] and Krishna in [[Tamil language]] are collectively known as ''Naalayira'' [[Divya Prabandha]](4000 divine verses).{{sfn|Annangaracariyar|1971}}{{sfn|Seth|1962}}

This period saw the growth of Vashnavism Sampradayas (denominations or communities) under the influence of scholars such as [[Ramanujacharya]], Vedantha Desikacharya, [[Madhvacharya]], [[Nimbarkacharya]] and [[Vallabhacharya]].{{Sfn|Beck|2012|p=6}} Bhakti poets or teachers such as [[Manavala Mamunigal]], [[Namdev]], [[Ramananda]], [[Surdas]], [[Tulsidas]], [[Eknath]], [[Tyagaraja]], Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and many others influenced the expansion of Vaishnavism.Even Meera bai(princess of Mehwar and Rajasthan)took part in this specific movement.{{sfn|Jackson|1992}}{{sfn|Jackson|1991}}&lt;ref&gt;John Stratton Hawley (2015), A Storm of Songs: India and the Idea of the Bhakti Movement, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674187467}}, pages 304-310&lt;/ref&gt; These Vaishnavism sampradaya founders challenged the then dominant [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]'s doctrines of Advaita Vedanta, particularly [[Ramanuja]] in the 12th century, Vedantha Desikacharya and [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]] in the 13th, building their theology on the devotional tradition of the [[Alvars]] ([[Shri Vaishnavas]]).&lt;ref name="Bartley2013p1"/&gt;

In North and Eastern India, Krishnaism gave rise to various late Medieval movements: [[Nimbarka]] and [[Ramananda]] in the 14th century, [[Sankaradeva]] in the 15th and [[Vallabha]] and [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]] in the 16th century. Historically, it was [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] who founded congregational chanting of holy names of Krishna in the early 16th century after becoming a [[sannyasi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhajankutir.net/essays/nama-theology.pdf|title=Caitanya Vais.n. avism and the Holy Names|last=Delmonico|first=Neal|date=April 4, 2004|website=Bhajan Kutir|access-date=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20th century, Vaishnavism has spread from India and is now practiced in many places around the globe, including [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Russia]] and [[South America]].

==Beliefs==

===Theism with many varieties===
Vaishnavism is centered on the devotion of Vishnu and his avatars. According to Schweig, it is a "polymorphic monotheism, i.e. a theology that recognizes many forms (ananta rupa) of the one, single unitary divinity," since there are many forms of one original deity, with Vishnu taking many forms.{{sfn|Schweig|2013|p=18}} Okita, in contrast, states that the different denominations within Vaishnavism are best described as theism, [[pantheism]] and [[panentheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Kiyokazu Okita (2010), Theism, Pantheism, and Panentheism: Three Medieval Vaishnava Views of Nature and their Possible Ecological Implications, Journal of Vaishnava Studies, Volume 18, Number 2, pages 5-26&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vaishnava sampradaya started by Madhvacharya is a monotheistic tradition wherein Vishnu (Krishna) is omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=360-361}} In contrast, Sri Vaishnavism sampradaya associated with Ramanuja has monotheistic elements, but differs in several ways, such as goddess Lakshmi and god Vishnu are considered as inseparable equal divinities.&lt;ref&gt;William Wainwright (2013), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/monotheism/#ShrVaiMon Monotheism], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to some scholars, Sri Vaishnavism emphasizes panentheism, and not monotheism, with its theology of "transcendence and immanence",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harold Coward |author2=Daniel C.

====Vishnuism and Krishnaism====
The term "Krishnaism" has been used to describe the sects focused on Krishna, while "Vishnuism" may be used for sects focusing on Vishnu in which Krishna is an [[Avatar]], rather than a transcended Supreme Being.{{Sfn|Flood|1996| p= 117}} Vishnuism believes in [[Vishnu]] as the supreme being, manifested himself as Krishna, while Krishnaism accepts Krishna to be [[Svayam bhagavan]] or "authentic", that manifested himself as Vishnu. As such Krishnaism is believed to be one of the early attempts to make philosophical [[Hinduism]] appealing to the masses.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8407-4419-6"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wilson, Bill |author2=McDowell, Josh |title=The best of Josh McDowell: a ready defense | publisher =T. Nelson | location =Nashville |year=1993 |pages=352–353 |isbn=978-0-8407-4419-7 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In common language the term Krishnaism is not often used, as many prefer a wider term "Vaishnavism", which appeared to relate to Vishnu, more specifically as Vishnu-ism.

====Vishnu====
In [[Vishnuism|Vishnu-centered]] sects Vishnu or [[Narayana]] is the one supreme God. The belief in the supremacy of Vishnu is based upon the many avatars (incarnations) of Vishnu listed in the [[Puranic]] texts, which differs from other Hindu deities such as [[Ganesha]], [[Surya]] or [[Durga]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

====Krishna====
[[File:Krishna as the supreme deity in relation to Vishnu.png|thumb|right|Relationship between different forms of Krishna as ''[[Avatar|paripurna avatara]]'' of Vishnu and as Svayam Bhagavan in Chaitanya school of Vaishnavism.{{sfn|Schweig|2013|p=17–19}}]]
{{Main|Krishna}}

In the Krishnaism branch of Vaishnavism, such as the [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]], [[Nimbarka]] and [[Vallabhacharya]] traditions, devotees worship Krishna as the One Supreme form of [[God]], and source of all avatars, [[Svayam Bhagavan]].&lt;ref name="Ramanuja" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Latourette|first=Kenneth Scott|date=1961|title=Review of India and Christendom: The Historical Connections between Their Religions|journal=Pacific Affairs|volume=34|issue=3|pages=317–318|doi=10.2307/2753385|jstor=2753385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishnaism is often also called Bhagavatism, after the [[Bhagavata Purana]] which asserts that Krishna is "Bhagavan Himself," and subordinates to itself all other forms: [[Vishnu]], [[Narayana]], [[Purusha]], [[Ishvara]], [[Hari]], [[Vasudeva]], [[Janardana]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;"It becomes clear that the personality of Bhagvan Krishna subordinates to itself the titles and identities of Vishnu, Narayana, Purusha, Ishvara, Hari, Vasudeva, Janardana etc.  The pervasive theme, then, of the ''Bhagavata Puran'' is the identification of Bhagavan with Krishna."{{harv|Sheridan|1986|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishna is often described as having the appearance of a dark-skinned person and is depicted as a young cowherd boy playing a [[Bansuri|flute]] or as a youthful prince giving philosophical direction and guidance, as in the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Parrinder |title=Sexual Morality in the World's Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LsnAAAAYAAJ |date=1996 |publisher= Oneword |isbn= 978-1-85168-108-2|pages=9–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishna is also worshiped across many other traditions of [[Hinduism]], and Krishna and the stories associated with him appear across a broad spectrum of different Hindu [[Hindu philosophy|philosophical]] and theological traditions, where it is believed that [[God]] appears to his devoted worshippers in many different forms, depending on their particular desires. These forms include the different ''avataras'' of Krishna described in traditional [[Vaishnava]] texts, but they are not limited to these. Indeed, it is said that the different expansions of the [[Svayam bhagavan]] are uncountable and they cannot be fully described in the finite scriptures of any one religious community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://vedabase.net/cc/madhya/20/165/en |title=Chaitanya Charitamrita ''Madhya'' 20.165 |access-date=7 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917122404/http://vedabase.net/cc/madhya/20/165/en |archive-date=17 September 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomson&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Richard Thompson |author2=Ph.

====Radha Krishna====
{{Main|Radha Krishna}}

''Radha Krishna'' is the combination of both the feminine as well as the masculine aspects of God. Krishna is often referred as ''[[svayam bhagavan]]'' in [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] theology and [[Radha]] is Krishna's supreme beloved.{{sfn|Schweig|2005|p=3}} With Krishna, Radha is acknowledged as the Supreme Goddess, for it is said that she controls Krishna with Her love.{{sfn|Rosen|2002|p=50}} It is believed that Krishna enchants the world, but Radha "enchants even Him. Therefore She is the supreme goddess of all. Radha Krishna".{{sfn|Rosen|2002|p=52}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Chaitanya-charitamrita]]''[http://vedabase.net/cc/adi/4/95/en Adi-lila 4.95] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824092217/http://vedabase.net/cc/adi/4/95/en |date=24 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are much earlier references to the worship of this form of [[God]], it is since [[Jayadeva]] Goswami wrote a famous poem ''[[Gita Govinda]]'' in the twelfth century CE, that the topic of the spiritual love affair between the divine Krishna and his devotee [[Radha]], became a theme celebrated throughout India.{{sfn|Schwartz|2004|p=49}} It is believed that Krishna has left the "circle" of the [[rasa dance]] to search for Radha. The Chaitanya school believes that the name and identity of Radha are both revealed and concealed in the verse describing this incident in [[Bhagavata Purana]].{{sfn|Schweig|2005|pp=41–42}} It is also believed that Radha is not just one cowherd maiden, but is the origin of all the [[gopis]], or divine personalities that participate in the [[rasa (theology)|rasa]] dance.{{sfn|Schweig|2005|p=43}}

====Dashavatara====
{{main|Dashavatara}}

According to the Bhagavatas, there are ten avatars of Vishnu, including [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]].{{sfn|Dandekar|1977|p=9500}} In contrast, the Pancaratrins follow the ''vyuhas'' doctrine, which says that God has four manifestations (''vyuhas''), namely Vasudeva, Samkarsana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha. These four manifestations represent "the Highest Self, the individual self, mind, and egoism."{{sfn|Dandekar|1977|p=9500}}

===Restoration of dharma===
Vaishnavism theology has developed the concept of avatar (incarnation) around Vishnu as the preserver or sustainer. His avatars, asserts Vaishnavism, descend to empower the good and fight evil, thereby restoring [[Dharma]]. This is reflected in the passages of the ancient [[Bhagavad Gita]] as:{{Sfn|Matchett|2001|pp=3-4}}{{Sfn|Kinsley|2005|p=15}}
{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
Whenever righteousness wanes and unrighteousness increases I send myself forth.
For the protection of the good and for the destruction of evil,
and for the establishment of righteousness,
I come into being age after age.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Bhagavad Gita 4.7–8{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=339-340}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mircea Eliade |author2=Charles J. Adams |title=The Encyclopedia of Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L74iAAAAYAAJ |volume=2|year=1987|publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-02-909710-6 |pages=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In Vaishnava mythology, such as is presented in the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' and the ''[[Pancaratra]]'', whenever the cosmos is in crisis, typically because the evil has grown stronger and has thrown the cosmos out of its balance, an avatar of Vishnu appears in a material form, to destroy evil and its sources, and restore the cosmic balance between the everpresent forces of good and evil.{{Sfn|Matchett|2001|pp=3-4}}{{Sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|p=228}} The most known and celebrated avatars of Vishnu, within the Vaishnavism traditions of Hinduism, are [[Krishna]], [[Rama]], [[Narayana]] and [[Vasudeva]]. These names have extensive literature associated with them, each has its own characteristics, legends and associated arts.{{Sfn|Matchett|2001|pp=3-4}} The ''Mahabharata'', for example, includes Krishna, while the ''Ramayana'' includes Rama.{{Sfn|Anna King|2005|pages=32–33}}

==Texts==
The Vedas, the Upanishads, the ''Bhagavad Gita'' and the [[Agama (Hinduism)|Agamas]] are the scriptural sources of Vaishnavism,&lt;ref name=klausscrip&gt;Klaus Klostermaier (2007), A Survey of Hinduism: Third Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791470824}}, pages 46-52, 76-77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goodallix&gt;Dominic Goodall (1996), Hindu Scriptures, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520207783}}, page ix-xliii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RC Zaehner (1992), Hindu Scriptures, Penguin Random House, {{ISBN|978-0679410782}}, pages 1-11 and Preface&lt;/ref&gt; while the Bhagavata Purana is a revered and celebrated popular text, parts of which a few scholars such as Dominic Goodall include as a scripture.&lt;ref name=goodallix/&gt; Other important texts in the tradition include the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, as well as texts by various ''sampradayas'' (denominations within Vaishnavism). In many Vaishnava traditions, Krishna is accepted as a teacher, whose teachings are in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' and the ''Bhagavata Purana''.{{sfn|Klostermaier|2007}}{{refn|group=note|name="Klostermaier-Krishna"}}

===Scriptures===

====Vedas and Upanishads====
Vaishnavism, just like all Hindu traditions, considers the [[Vedas]] as the scriptural authority.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p474"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones |author2=James D. Ryan |title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC |date=2006 |publisher=Infobase |isbn=978-0-8160-7564-5 |pages=474 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dhavamony1999p33"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mariasusai Dhavamony |title=Hindu Spirituality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=58UZWWzqglMC |date=1999 |publisher=Gregorian Press |isbn=978-88-7652-818-7 |pages=32–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All traditions within Vaishnavism consider the [[Brahmana]]s, the [[Aranyaka]]s and the [[Upanishad]]s embedded within the four Vedas as [[Sruti]], while Smritis, which include all the epics, the Puranas and its Samhitas, states Mariasusai Dhavamony, are considered as "exegetical or expository literature" of the Vedic texts.&lt;ref name="Dhavamony1999p33"/&gt;

The Vedanta schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], that interpreted the Upanishads and the ''[[Brahma Sutra]]'', provided the philosophical foundations of Vaishnavism. Given the ancient archaic language of the Vedic texts, each school's interpretation varied, and this has been the source of differences between the ''sampradayas'' (denominations) of Vaishnavism.&lt;ref name="Inden1990p109"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald B.

=====Vaishnava Upanishads=====
Along with the reverence and exegetical analysis of the ancient [[Principal Upanishads]], Vaishnava-inspired scholars authored 14 Vishnu avatar-focussed Upanishads that are called the Vaishnava Upanishads.&lt;ref name=ayyangarminor&gt;{{cite book| last=Ayyangar| first = TRS| year=1941 | title=The Vaisnavopanisads| publisher = Jain Publishing Co.

All of the Vaishnava Upanishads either directly reference and quote from the ancient Principal Upanishads or incorporate some ideas found in them; most cited texts include the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], [[Chandogya Upanishad]], [[Katha Upanishad]], [[Isha Upanishad]], [[Mundaka Upanishad]], [[Taittiriya Upanishad]] and others.&lt;ref name=pdeussen247268/&gt;&lt;ref name=ayyangarvupa/&gt; In some cases, they cite fragments from the [[Brahmana]] and [[Aranyaka]] layers of the [[Rigveda]] and the [[Yajurveda]].&lt;ref name=pdeussen247268/&gt;

====Bhagavad Gita====
The ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' is a central text in Vaishnavism, and especially in the context of Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;James Mulhern (1959) A History of Education: A Social Interpretation p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Franklin Edgerton]] (1925) The Bhagavad Gita: Or, Song of the Blessed One, India's Favorite Bible [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1guGAfGr6UC&amp;pg=RA2-PA87&amp;dq=%22bible+of+Krsnaism%22&amp;ei=cKCPSJulJZD0jgGAr8CGCQ&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U3aHo_Nj-OFUc057nkj5rPLirfn8A pp. 87-91]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Vaudeville has said, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1oqTYiPeAxMC&amp;pg=PT119&amp;dq=%22bible+of+Krsnaism%22&amp;ei=cKCPSJulJZD0jgGAr8CGCQ&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U0-7wQkZxeQEkWtv89fsSAi4Ockwg it is the 'real Bible of Krsnaism']. Quoted in: Matchett, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Bhagavad Gita'' is an important scripture not only within Vaishnavism, but also to other traditions of Hinduism.{{Sfn|Flood|1996|pp=124-128}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard H.

The ''Bhagavad Gita'' is a dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna, and presents Bhakti, Jnana and Karma yoga as alternate ways to spiritual liberation, with the choice left to the individual.{{Sfn|Flood|1996|pp=124-128}} The text discusses [[dharma]], and its pursuit as duty without craving for fruits of one's actions, as a form of spiritual path to liberation.{{Sfn|Flood|1996|pp=125-126}} The text, state Clooney and Stewart, succinctly summarizes the foundations of Vaishnava theology that the entire universe exists within Vishnu, and all aspects of life and living is not only a divine order but divinity itself.{{Sfn|Francis Clooney |Tony Stewart| 2004|p=163}} Bhakti, in Bhagavad Gita, is an act of sharing, and a deeply personal awareness of spirituality within and without.{{Sfn|Francis Clooney |Tony Stewart| 2004|p=163}}

The ''Bhagavad Gita'' is a summary of the classical Upanishads and Vedic philosophy, and closely associated with the Bhagavata and related traditions of Vaishnavism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard H. Davis |title=The "Bhagavad Gita": A Biography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vQ3rAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1-4008-5197-3 |pages=58–59, 170 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Georg Feuerstein |author2=Brenda Feuerstein |title=The Bhagavad-Gita |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V0exkVFiyvcC |date=2011 |publisher=Shambhala Publications |isbn=978-1-59030-893-6 |pages=64–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The text has been commented upon and integrated into diverse Vaishnava denominations, such as by the medieval era Madhvacharya's Dvaita Vedanta school and Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita Vedanta school, as well as 20th century Vaishnava movements such as the Hare Krishna movement by Swami Prabhupada.{{Sfn|Flood|1996|pp=124-125}}

====Vaishnava Agamas====
The ''Pancaratra Samhitas'' (literally, five nights) is a genre of texts where Vishnu is presented as Narayana and Vasudeva, and this genre of Vaishnava texts is also known as the Vaishnava [[Agama (Hinduism)|Agamas]].{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=121-122}}&lt;ref name="Schrader1973p2"/&gt; Its doctrines are found embedded in the stories within the Narayaniya section of the ''Mahabharata''.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=121}} Narayana is presented as the ultimate unchanging truth and reality (Brahman), who pervades the entirety of the universe and is asserted to be the preceptor of all religions.{{Sfn|Flood|1996|p=121}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy L.

The Pancaratra texts present the ''Vyuhas'' theory of avatars to explain how the absolute reality (Brahman) manifests into material form of ever changing reality (Vishnu avatar).{{Sfn|Flood|1996|p=121}}&lt;ref name="Schrader1973p31"&gt;{{cite book|author=F Otto Schrader |title=Introduction to the Pāñcarātra and the Ahirbudhnya Saṃhitā |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JmIpAAAAYAAJ |year=1973|publisher=Adyar Library and Research Centre |isbn=978-0-8356-7277-1 |pages=31–49, 79–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vasudeva, state the Pancaratra texts, goes through a series of emanations, where new avatars of him appear. This theory of avatar formation syncretically integrates the theories of evolution of matter and life developed by the [[Samkhya]] school of Hindu philosophy.{{Sfn|Flood|1996|p=122}}&lt;ref name="Schrader1973p31"/&gt; These texts also present cosmology, methods of worship, tantra, Yoga and principles behind the design and building of Vaishnava temples (''Mandira nirmana'').{{Sfn|Flood|1996|p=122}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=F Otto Schrader |title=Introduction to the Pāñcarātra and the Ahirbudhnya Saṃhitā |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JmIpAAAAYAAJ |year=1973|publisher=Adyar Library and Research Centre |isbn=978-0-8356-7277-1 |pages=30, 150–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HarperBrown2012p133"/&gt; These texts have guided religiosity and temple ceremonies in many Vaishnava communities, particularly in South India.{{Sfn|Flood|1996|p=122}}

The ''Pancaratra Samhitas'' are tantric in emphasis, and at the foundation of tantric Vaishnava traditions such as the Sri Vaishnava tradition.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=122-123}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Teun Goudriaan |author2=Sanjukta Gupta |title=Hindu Tantric and Śākta Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r2q1h7q-JWMC |date=1981 |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |isbn=978-3-447-02091-6 |pages=105–111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They complement and compete with the vedic Vaishnava traditions such as the Bhagavata tradition, which emphasize the more ancient Vedic texts, ritual grammar and procedures.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=122-123}}&lt;ref name="HarperBrown2012p133"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis Hudson |editor1=Katherine Anne Harper |editor2=Robert L Brown |title=The Roots of Tantra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtKrbKIOL5wC |year=2012|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8890-4 |pages=133–156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the practices vary, the philosophy of Pancaratra is primarily derived from the Upanishads, its ideas synthesize Vedic concepts and incorporate Vedic teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harvey P. Alper |title=Mantra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMPibh4_XuoC |date=1989 |publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn= 978-0-88706-599-6 |pages=242–243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

The three most studied texts of this genre of Vaishnava religious texts are ''Paushkara Samhita'', ''Sattvata Samhita'' and ''Jakakhya Samhita''.{{Sfn|Flood|1996|p=122}}&lt;ref&gt;H Daniel Smith (1972), The three gems of the Pancharatra canon - An appraisal, Journal: Vimarsa, Volume 1, Issue 1, pages 45-51; (Reprinted by Brill Academic in ''Ex Orbe Religionum'', Editor: C.

Of the 18 Mahapuranas (great Puranas), many have titles based on one of the avatars of Vishnu. However, quite many of these are actually, in large part, Shiva-related Puranas, likely because these texts were revised over their history.&lt;ref&gt;Ludo Rocher (1986), The Puranas, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447025225}}, pages 35, 185, 199, 239-242&lt;/ref&gt; Some were revised into Vaishnava treatises, such as the ''[[Brahma Vaivarta Purana]]'', which originated as a Puranic text dedicated to the [[Surya]] (Sun god). Textual cross referencing evidence suggests that in or after 15th/16th century CE, it went through a series of major revisions, and almost all extant manuscripts of ''Brahma Vaivarta Purana'' are now Vaishnava (Krishna) bhakti oriented.&lt;ref&gt;Ludo Rocher (1986), The Puranas, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447025225}}, pages 161-164&lt;/ref&gt; Of the extant manuscripts, the main Vaishnava Puranas are ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'', ''[[Nāradeya Purana]]'', ''[[Garuda Purana]]'', ''[[Vayu Purana]]'' and ''[[Varaha Purana]]''.&lt;ref name=ludorocher2021&gt;Ludo Rocher (1986), The Puranas, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447025225}}, pages 59-61&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Brahmanda Purana]]'' is notable for the ''Adhyatma-ramayana'', a Rama-focussed embedded text in it, which philosophically attempts to synthesize [[Bhakti]] in god Rama with [[Shaktism]] and [[Advaita Vedanta]].&lt;ref&gt;Ludo Rocher (1986), The Puranas, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447025225}}, pages=158-159 with footnotes, '''Quote:''' "Among the texts considered to be connected with the ''Brahmanda'', the ''Adhyatma-ramayana'' is undoubtedly the most important one".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |series= |last=Winternitz |first=Maurice |authorlink= Moriz Winternitz |title=History of Indian Literature Vol 1 (Original in German, translated into English by VS Sarma, 1981) |year=1922 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprint 2010) |location=New Delhi |isbn= 978-8120802643 |page=552 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramdas Lamb |title=Rapt in the Name |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R51OEErb9g8C |date=1 February 2012|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-8856-0 |pages=29–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While an avatar of Vishnu is the main focus of the Puranas of Vaishnavism, these texts also include chapters that revere Shiva, Shakti (goddess power), Brahma and a pantheon of Hindu deities.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Holdrege (2015), Bhakti and Embodiment, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415670708}}, pages 113-114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Bryant (2003), Krishna: The Beautiful Legend of God: Srimad Bhagavata Purana, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0141913377}}, pages 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludo Rocher (1986), The Puranas, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447025225}}, pages 104-106 with footnotes, Quote: "I want to stress the fact that it would be irresponsible and highly misleading to speak of or pretend to describe the religion of the Puranas."&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy and teachings of the Vaishnava Puranas are [[bhakti]] oriented (often Krishna, but Rama features in some), but they show an absence of a "narrow, sectarian spirit".

Their poems, compiled as [[Divya Prabhandham]], developed into an influential scripture for the Vaishnavas. The [[Bhagavata Purana]]'s references to the South Indian Alvar saints, along with its emphasis on ''bhakti'', have led many scholars to give it South Indian origins, though some scholars question whether this evidence excludes the possibility that ''bhakti'' movement had parallel developments in other parts of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=[[J.

Vaishnavas mark their foreheads with ''[[tilaka]]''made up of Chandana, either as a daily ritual, or on special occasions. The different Vaishnava sampradayas each have their own distinctive [[Tilak (Vaishnava)|style of tilaka]], which depicts the [[siddhanta]] of their particular lineage. The general tilaka pattern is of a parabolic shape resembling the letter U or two or more connected vertical lines on and another optional line on the nose resembling the letter Y, which usually represents the foot of Vishnu and the centre vertical line symbolizing his manhood. Alternate interpretations suggest that the symbol is representation of male and female parts in union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-621641/Vaishnavism britannica.com Vaishnavism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127133553/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-621641/Vaishnavism |date=27 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stephen-knapp.com/tilak_why_wear_it.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In tantric traditions of Vaishnavism, during the initiation ([[diksha]]) given by a [[guru]] under whom they are trained to understand Vaishnava practices, the initiates accept Vishnu as supreme. At the time of initiation, the disciple is traditionally given a specific [[mantra]], which the disciple will repeat, either out loud or within the mind, as an act of worship to Vishnu or one of his avatars. The practice of repetitive prayer is known as [[japa]].

In the Gaudiya Vaishnava group, one who performs an act of worship with the name of Vishnu or Krishna can be considered a Vaishnava by practice, "Who chants the holy name of Krishna just once may be considered a Vaishnava."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bvml.org/SGK/03.html Chaitanya Charitamrita: Madhya-lila, 15.106]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pilgrimage sites===
Important sites of pilgrimage for Vaishnavas include [[Guruvayur Temple]], [[SriRangam]], [[Vrindavan]], [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], [[Ayodhya]], [[Tirupati (city)|Tirupati]], [[Pandharpur|Pandharpur (Vitthal)]], [[Puri|Puri (Jaggannath)]], [[Shri Laxmi Narsimha Temple|Nira Narsingpur (Narasimha)]], [[Mayapur]], [[Nathdwara]], [[Dwarka]] Udipi(Karnataka)and [[Muktinath (NEPAL)]].&lt;ref name="Klostermaier"&gt;{{Cite book |first = Klaus K.| last = Klostermaier |author-link = Oxford University |title = Hinduism: A Short History |place = Oxford |publisher = Oneworld Publications |year = 2000 |isbn = 978-1-85168-213-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Valpey2004&gt;{{cite book |author = Valpey, K.R. |year = 2004 |title = The Grammar and Poetics of Murti-Seva: Chaitanya Vaishnava Image Worship as Discourse, Ritual, and Narrative |publisher = University of Oxford |isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holy places===
{{Main|Vrindavana|Goloka}}

[[Vrindavana]] is often considered to be a holy place by majority of traditions of Krishnaism. It is a center of Krishna worship and the area includes places like [[Govardhan Hill|Govardhana]] and [[Gokula]] associated with Krishna from time immemorial. Many millions of ''bhaktas'' or devotees of [[Krishna]] visit these places of pilgrimage every year and participate in a number of festivals that relate to the scenes from Krishna's life on Earth.{{sfn|Klostermaier|2007}}{{refn|group=note|name=Klostermaier|Klostermaier: "[[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Bhagavata Purana]], certainly the most popular religious books in the whole of India. Not only was Krsnaism influenced by the identification of Krsna with Vishnu, but also Vaishnavism as a whole was partly transformed and reinvented in the light of the popular and powerful Krishna religion. Bhagavatism may have brought an element of cosmic religion into Krishna worship; Krishna has certainly brought a strongly human element into Bhagavatism [...] The center of Krishna-worship has been for a long time [[Braj]]bhumi, the district of [[Mathura]] that embraces also Vrindavana, Govardhana, and Gokula, associated with Krishna from time immemorial. Many millions of Krishna ''bhaktas'' visit these places ever year and participate in the numerous festivals that reenact scenes from Krshna's life on Earth."{{sfn|Klostermaier|2007}}}}

On the other hand, [[Goloka]] is considered the eternal abode of [[Krishna]], [[Svayam bhagavan]] according to some [[Vaishnava]] schools, including [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] and the [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]]. The scriptural basis for this is taken in [[Brahma Samhita]] and [[Bhagavata Purana]].&lt;ref name=Schweig2005&gt;{{cite book | author = SCHWEIG, G.M. | year = 2005 | title = Dance of divine love: The Rasa Lila of Krishna from the Bhagavata Purana, India's classic sacred love story | publisher = Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Oxford | isbn = 978-0-691-11446-0 | pages = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==

===Four sampradayas and other sects===
The Vaishnavism traditions may be grouped within four [[sampradaya]]s, each exemplified by a specific Vedic personality.

The philosophical systems of Vaishnava sampradayas range from theistic [[Dvaita]] of Madhvacharya, to qualified [[monism|monistic]] [[Vishishtadvaita]] of Ramanuja, to pure [[nondualism|nondualistic]] [[Shuddhadvaita]] of Vallabhacharya. They all revere an avatar of Vishnu, but have varying theories on the relationship between the soul ([[jiva]]) and [[Brahman]],&lt;ref name = "Mahony87"/&gt;{{sfn|Beck|2012|pp=74-77}} on the nature of changing and unchanging reality, methods of worship, as well as on spiritual liberation for the householder stage of life versus [[sannyasa]] (renunciation) stage.{{sfn|Beck|2012|pp=76-77}}{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|pages=288–304, 340–350}}

Beyond the four major sampradayas, the situation is more complicated,{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=134-135}} with the Vaikhanasas being much older{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=123}} than those four sampradayas, and a number of additional traditions and sects which originated later,{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=135}} or aligned themselves with one of those four sampradayas.&lt;ref group=web name="Rosen-Deadwyler" /&gt; Krishna sampradayas continued to be founded late into late medieval and during the [[Mughal Empire]] era, such as the [[Radha-vallabha|Radhavallabha]], Haridasi, Gaudiya and others.{{sfn|Beck|2012|pp=70-79}}

===Early traditions===

====Bhagavats====
The Bhagavats were the early worshippers of Krishna, the followers of ''Bhagavat'', the Lord, in the person of [[Krishna]], [[Vasudeva]], [[Vishnu]] or [[Bhagavan]].{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=123-124}} The term ''bhagavata'' may have denoted a general religious tradition or attitude of theistic worship which prevailed until the 11th century, and not a specific sect,{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=123}}{{sfn|Welbon|2005a|p=9501}} and is best known as a designation for Vishnu-devotees.{{sfn|Welbon|2005a|p=9501}} The earliest scriptural evidence of Vaishnava bhagavats is an inscription from 115 BCE, in which [[Heliodorus pillar|Heliodoros]], ambassador of the Greco-Bactrian king Amtalikita, says that he is a bhagavata of 
Vasudeva.{{sfn|Welbon|2005a|p=9502}} It was supported by the Guptas, suggesting a widespread appeal, in contrast to specific sects.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=123-124}}

====Pancaratra====
{{Main|Pancaratra|Narayana}}

The ''Pāñcarātra'' is the tradition of Narayana-worship.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=121}} The term ''pāñcarātra'' means "five nights," from ''pañca'', "five,"and ''rātra'', "nights,"{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2007|p=321-322}}{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=121}} and may be derived from the "five night sacrifice" as described in the ''Satapatha Brahmana'', which narrates how Purusa-Narayana intends to become the highest being by performing a sacrifice which lasts five nights.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=121}}

The ''Narayaniya'' section of the Mahabharata describes the ideas of the ''Pāñcarātras''.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=121}} Characteristic is the description of the manifestation of the Absolute through a series of manifestations, from the ''vyuha'' manifestations of Vasudeva and pure creation, through the [[tattvas]] of mixed creation into impure or material creation.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=121-122}}

The ''Pāñcarātra Samhitas'' developed from the 7th or 8th century onward, and belongs to [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamic]] or Tantras,{{sfn|N.N.1|1940|p=7}}{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=122}} setting them at odds with vedic orthodoxy.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=122-123}} Vishnu worshipers in south India still follow the system of Pancharatra worship as described in these texts.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=122}}

Although the ''Pāñcarātra'' originated in north India, it had a strong influence on south India, where it is closely related with the Sri Vaishnava tradition. According to Welbon, "''Pāñcarātra'' cosmological and ritual theory and practice combine with the unique vernacular devotional poetry of the Alvars, and Ramanuja, founder of the Sri Vaishnava tradition, propagated ''Pāñcarātra'' ideas."{{sfn|Welbon|2005b|p=9509}} Ramananda was also influenced by ''Pāñcarātra'' ideas through the influence of Sri Vaishnavism, whereby ''Pāñcarātra'' re-entered north India.{{sfn|Welbon|2005b|p=9509}}

=====Vaikhanasas=====
{{Main|Vaikhanasas}}

The Vaikhanasas are associated with the ''Pāñcarātra'', but regard themselves as a Vedic orthodox sect.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=123}}&lt;ref&gt;Jan Gonda (1977), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/616501 Religious Thought and Practice in Vaikhānasa Viṣṇuism], Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Vol. 40, No. 3, pages 550-571&lt;/ref&gt; Modern ''Vaikhanasas'' reject elements of  the ''Pāñcarātra'' and ''Sri Vaishnava'' tradition, but the historical relationship with the orthodox ''Vaikhanasa'' in south India is unclear.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The ''Vaikhanasas'' may have resisted the incorporation of the devotic elements of the Alvar tradition, while the ''Pāñcarātras'' were open to this incorporation.{{sfn|Welbon|2005b|p=9509}}{{full citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Vaikhanasas have their own foundational text, the ''Vaikhanasasmarta Sutra'', which describes a mixture of Vedic and non-Vedic ritual worship.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=123}} The Vaikhanasas became chief priests in a lot of south Indian temples, where they still remain influential.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=123}}

===Medieval traditions===

====Smartism====
{{Main|Smarta Tradition}}

The Smarta tradition developed during the (early) Classical Period of Hinduism around the beginning of the Common Era, when Hinduism emerged from the interaction between Brahmanism and local traditions.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013}}{{sfn|Flood|1996}} According to Flood, Smartism developed and expanded with the [[Purana]]s genre of literature.{{Sfn|Flood|1996|p=113}} By the time of Adi Shankara,{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013}} it had developed the ''pancayatanapuja'', the worship of five shrines with five deities, all treated as equal, namely [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], [[Ganesha]], [[Surya]] and [[Durga|Devi]] (Shakti),{{Sfn|Flood|1996|p=113}} "as a solution to varied and conflicting devotional practices."{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013}}

Traditionally, Sri Adi Shankaracharya (8th century) is regarded as the greatest teacher and reformer of the Smarta.{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=1017}}{{sfn|Popular Prakashan|2000|p=52}} According to Hiltebeitel, Adi Shankara Acharya established the nondualist interpretation of the Upanishads as the touchstone of a revived ''smarta'' tradition.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013}}{{refn|group=note|Hiltebeitel: "Practically, Adi Shankara Acharya fostered a rapprochement between Advaita and ''smarta'' orthodoxy, which by his time had not only continued to defend the ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|varnasramadharma]]'' theory as defining the path of ''karman'', but had developed the practice of ''pancayatanapuja'' ("five-shrine worship") as a solution to varied and conflicting devotional practices. Thus one could worship any one of five deities (Vishnu, Siva, Durga, Surya, Ganesa) as one's ''istadevata'' ("deity of choice")."{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013}}}}

====Alvars====
[[File:Nammazhwar.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nammalvar]]]]
{{Main|Alvars}}

The Alvars, "those immersed in god," were twelve{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=131}} [[Tamil people|Tamil]] poet-saints of [[South India]] who espoused [[bhakti]] (devotion) to the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Vishnu]] or his [[avatar]] [[Krishna]] in their songs of longing, ecstasy and service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mahavidya.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Nippard-Andrea-The-Alvars-Yes.pdf |title=The Alvars |author=Andrea Nippard |accessdate=2013-04-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001609/http://www.mahavidya.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Nippard-Andrea-The-Alvars-Yes.pdf |archive-date=3 December 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alvars appeared between the 5th century to the 10th century CE, though the Vaishnava tradition regards the Alvars to have lived between 4200 BCE - 2700 BCE.

The devotional writings of Alvars, composed during the early medieval period of [[History of Tamil Nadu|Tamil history]], are key texts in the [[bhakti movement]]. They praised the [[Divya Desam]]s, 108 "abodes" (temples) of the Vaishnava deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Literature Through the Ages|url=http://ccrtindia.gov.in/literaryarts.htm|publisher=Indian literature, Govt of India|accessdate=2013-04-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515213735/http://ccrtindia.gov.in/literaryarts.htm|archive-date=15 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of their hymns is known as ''[[Divya Prabandha]]''. Their Bhakti-poems has contributed to the establishment and sustenance of a culture that opposed the ritual-oriented Vedic religion and rooted itself in devotion as the only path for salvation.&lt;ref name="About Alvars"&gt;{{cite web| title=''About Alvars'' | publisher=divyadesamonline.com| url =http://www.divyadesamonline.com/alwars.asp| accessdate= 2007-07-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070621230057/http://www.divyadesamonline.com/alwars.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary traditions===
Gavin Flood mentions five most important contemporary Vaisnava orders.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=135}}

====Sri Vaishnava====
{{Main|Sri Vaishnavism}}

The Sri Vaishnava community consists of both Smarta Brahmans and non-Brahmans.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=137-138}} It existed along with a larger purana-based Brahamanic worshippers of Vishnu, and non-Brahmanic groups who worshipped and felt possessed by non-Vishnu village deities.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=137-138}} The Sri Vaishnavism movement grew with its social inclusiveness, where emotional devotionalism to personal god (Vishnu) has been open without limitation to gender or caste.&lt;ref name="Bartley2013p1"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Vishnu is regionally called by other names, such as Ranganatha at Srirangam temple in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref name=jonesryanp352&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones |author2=James D. Ryan |title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC |date=2006 |publisher=Infobase |isbn=978-0-8160-7564-5 |pages=352 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sri Vaishnavism developed in Tamil Nadu in the 10th century.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=135-136}} It incorporated two different traditions, namely the tantric Pancaratra tradition and the puranic Vishnu worship of northern India with their abstract Vedantic theology, and the southern bhakti tradition of the Alvars of Tamil Nadu with their personal devotion.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=135-136}}&lt;ref name="Bartley2013p1"/&gt; The tradition was founded by [[Nathamuni]] (10th century), who along with [[Yamunacharya]], combined the two traditions and gave the tradition legitimacy by drawing on the Alvars.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=136}} Its most influential leader was [[Ramanuja]] (1017-1137), who developed the [[Visistadvaita]] ("qualified non-dualism") philosophy.{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=133, 136}} Ramanuja challenged the then dominant [[Advaita Vedanta]] interpretation of the Upanishads and Vedas, by formulating the Vishishtadvaita philosophy foundations for Sri Vaishnavism from Vedanta.&lt;ref name="Bartley2013p1"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. J. Bartley |title=The Theology of Ramanuja: Realism and Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9SpTAQAAQBAJ |date= 2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-85306-7 |pages=1–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri Vaishnava includes the ritual and temple life in the tantra traditions of Pancaratra, emotional devotionalism to Vishnu, contemplative form bhakti, in the context of householder social and religious duties.&lt;ref name="Bartley2013p1"/&gt; The tantric rituals, refers to techniques and texts recited during worship, and these include Sanskrit and Tamil texts in South Indian Sri Vaishnava tradition.&lt;ref name=jonesryanp352/&gt; According to Sri Vaishnavism theology, ''moksha'' can be reached by devotion and service to the Lord and detachment from the world. When ''moksha'' is reached, the cycle of reincarnation is broken and the soul is united with Vishnu after death, though maintaining their distinctions, in ''vaikuntha'', Vishnu's heaven.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=136-137}} Moksha can also be reached by total surrender and ''saranagati'', an act of grace by the Lord.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=137}} Ramanuja's Sri Vaishnavism subscribes to ''videhamukti'' (liberation in afterlife), in contrast to ''jivanmukti'' (liberation in this life) found in other traditions within Hinduism, such as the Smarta and Shaiva traditions.&lt;ref name="Kim Skoog 1996 63–84, 236–239"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kim Skoog |editor1=Andrew O. Fort |editor2=Patricia Y. Mumme |title=Living Liberation in Hindu Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U1EZjyLbxYAC |date= 1996 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn= 978-0-7914-2706-4|pages= 63–84, 236–239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two hundred years after Ramanuja, the Sri Vaishnava tradition split into the ''[[Vadakalai]]'' ("northern culture") and ''[[Tenkalai]]'' ("southern culture"). The ''Vatakalai'' relied stronger on the Sanskrit scriptures, and emphasized bhakti by devotion to temple-icons, while the ''Tenkalai'' relied more on the Tamil heritage and total surrender.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=137}}

====Gaudiya Vaishnavism====
{{Main|Gaudiya Vaishnavism}}

Gaudiya Vaishnavism, also known as Chaitanya Vaishnavism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Encounter/foreword.html Hindu Encounter with Modernity, by Shukavak N. Dasa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511154723/http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Encounter/foreword.html |date=11 May 2008 }} "&lt;/ref&gt; and Hare Krishna, was founded by [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] (1486–1534) in [[India]]. "Gaudiya" refers to the [[Gauḍa region]] (present day [[Bengal]]/[[Bangladesh]]) with Vaishnavism meaning "the worship of [[Vishnu]] or [[Krishna]]". Its philosophical basis is primarily that of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and [[Bhagavata Purana]].

The focus of Gaudiya Vaishnavism is the devotional worship (''[[bhakti]]'') of [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]], and their many divine [[incarnations]] as the supreme forms of [[God]], ''[[Svayam Bhagavan]]''. Most popularly, this worship takes the form of singing Radha and Krishna's [[holy]] names, such as "[[Hari|Hare]]", "Krishna" and "[[Rama (disambiguation)|Rama]]", most commonly in the form of the [[Hare Krishna (mantra)]], also known as [[kirtan]]. It sees the many forms of Vishnu or Krishna as expansions or incarnations of the one Supreme God, ''[[adipurusha]]''.

After its decline in the 18-19th century, it was revived in the beginning of the 20th century due to the efforts of [[Bhaktivinoda Thakur]]. His son Srila [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura]] founded sixty-four Gaudiya Matha monasteries in India, Burma and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Bryant, Maria Ekstrand, The Hare Krishna Movement: The Postcharismatic Fate of a Religious Transplant (2004) - 448 pages
Page 130&lt;/ref&gt; Thakura's disciple [[Srila Prabhupada]] went to the west and spread Gaudiya Vaishnavism by the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON).

====Varkari-tradition and Vithoba-worship====
{{Main|Vithoba|Varkari}}

The Varkari-tradition is a non-[[Brahmanism|Brahamanical]]&lt;ref&gt;Zelliot (1988) p. xviii "Varkari cult is rural and non-Brahman in character"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sand (1990) p. 34 "the more or less anti-ritualistic and anti-brahmanical attitudes of Varkari sampradaya."&lt;/ref&gt; tradition which worships [[Vithoba]], also known as Vitthal, who is regarded as a form of Vishnu or Krishna. Vithoba is often depicted as a dark young boy, standing arms akimbo on a brick, sometimes accompanied by his main consort [[Rukmini|Rakhumai]]. The Varkari-tradition is geographically associated with the Indian states of [[Maharashtra]] and northern [[Karnataka]].

The Varkari movement includes a duty-based approach towards life, emphasizing moral behavior and strict avoidance of [[alcohol]] and [[tobacco]], the adoption of a strict [[lacto vegetarianism|lacto-vegetarian]] diet and fasting on ''[[Ekadashi]]'' day (twice a month), self-restraint (''[[brahmacharya]]'') during [[student]] life, equality and humanity for all rejecting discrimination based on the [[caste system in India|caste system]] or wealth, the reading of [[Hindu texts]], the recitation of the ''[[Haripath]]'' every day and the regular practice of ''[[bhajan]]'' and ''[[kirtan]]''. The most important festivals of Vithoba are held on the eleventh (''ekadashi'') day of the lunar months" [[Shayani Ekadashi]] in the month of [[Ashadha]], and [[Prabodhini Ekadashi]] in the month of [[Kartik (month)|Kartik]].

The Varkari poet-saints are known for their devotional lyrics, the [[abhang]], dedicated to Vithoba and composed in [[Marathi language|Marathi]]. Other devotional literature includes the Kannada hymns of the Haridasa, and Marathi versions of the generic [[aarti]] songs associated with rituals of offering light to the deity. Notable saints and [[guru]]s of the Varkaris include [[Jñāneśvar]], [[Namdev]], [[Chokhamela]], [[Eknath]], and [[Tukaram]], all of whom are accorded the title of [[Sant (religion)|Sant]].

Though the origins of both his cult and his main temple are debated, there is clear evidence that they already existed by the 13th century. Various [[indology|Indologists]] have proposed a prehistory for Vithoba worship where he was previously a [[hero stone]], a pastoral deity, a manifestation of [[Shiva]], a [[Jain monasticism|Jain saint]], or even all of these at various times for various devotees.

====Ramanandi tradition====
{{main|Ramananda|Ramanandi Sampradaya}}

The Ramanandi Sampradaya, also known as the Ramayats or the Ramavats,{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=254}} is one of the largest and most egalitarian Hindu sects India, around the [[Ganges Plain]], and Nepal today.{{sfn| Burghart |1983|p=362}} It mainly emphasizes the worship of [[Rama]],{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=254}} as well as [[Vishnu]] directly and other incarnations.{{sfn|Tattwananda|1984|p=10}} Most Ramanandis consider themselves to be the followers of [[Ramananda]], a [[Vaishnava]] saint in medieval India.{{sfn|Raj|Harman|2007|p=165}} Philosophically, they are in the [[Vishishtadvaita]] ([[IAST]] {{IAST|Viśiṣṭādvaita}}) tradition.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=254}}

Its ascetic wing constitutes the largest Vaishnava [[Hindu monasticism|monastic order]] and may possibly be the largest monastic order in all of India.{{sfn|Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia 1999}} {{IAST|Rāmānandī}} ascetics rely upon meditation and strict ascetic practices, but also believe that the grace of god is required for them to achieve liberation.

Kabir was a 15th-century Indian [[Mysticism|mystic]] [[poet]] and [[saint]], whose writings influenced the [[Bhakti movement]], but whose verses are also found in Sikhism's scripture [[Adi Granth]].&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/309270/Kabir Kabir] Encyclopædia Britannica (2015)Accessed: July 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tinker1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ronaldsikh&gt;Ronald McGregor (1984), Hindi literature from its beginnings to the nineteenth century, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447024136}}, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; His early life was in a Muslim family, but he was strongly influenced by his teacher, the Hindu bhakti leader [[Ramananda]].&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tinker1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh Tinker|title=South Asia: A Short History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n5uU2UteUpEC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=12 July 2012|year=1990|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1287-4|pages=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rekha Pande (2014), Divine Sounds from the Heart—Singing Unfettered in their Own Voices, Cambridge Scholars, {{ISBN|978-1443825252}}, page 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ronald&gt;Ronald McGregor (1984), Hindi literature from its beginnings to the nineteenth century, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447024136}}, pages 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars state Kabir's ideas were one of the many influences&lt;ref&gt;WH McLeod (2003), Exploring Sikhism: Aspects of Sikh Identity, Culture, and Thought, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195658569}}, pages 19–31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Lorenzen (1981), Religious change and cultural domination, Colegio Mexico, {{ISBN|978-9681201081}}, pages 173–191&lt;/ref&gt; on Guru Nanak, who went on to found Sikhism in the fifteenth century. Other Sikh scholars disagree, stating there are differences between the views and practices of Kabir and Nanak.&lt;ref name="Archive"&gt;J. S. Grewal (2010), WH McLeod and Sikh Studies, Journal of Punjab Studies, Vol. 17, Issue 1–2, page 119, [http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v17_1-2/articles/JPS_17_nos_1-2_Grewal.pdf Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gandhi"&gt;{{cite book | title=History of Sikh Gurus Retold: 1469-1606 C.E | publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors Pvt Ltd | author=Gandhi, Surjit Singh | authorlink=Guru Nanak and Kabir | year=2008 | location=English | pages=174 to 176 | isbn=978-8126908578| id= {{ASIN|8126908572|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nikki"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Feminine Principle in the Sikh Vision of the Transcendent | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh | date=24 Sep 1993 | location=English | pages=114–116 | isbn=978-0521432870| id= {{ASIN|0521432871|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harpreet Singh, quoting Hew McLeod, states, "In its earliest stage Sikhism was clearly a movement within the Hindu tradition; [[Nanak]] was raised a Hindu and eventually belonged to the [[Sant (religion)|Sant]] tradition of northern India, a movement associated with the great poet and mystic Kabir."&lt;ref&gt;Pashaura Singh and Louis E. Fenech (2014), The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, page 205&lt;/ref&gt; Surjit Singh Gandhi{{better source|date=August 2015}} disagrees, and writes "Guru Nanak in his thought pattern as well as in action model was fundamentally different from Kabir and for that matter other radical Bhaktas or saints (saint has been erroneously used for such Bhaktas by Mcleod). Hence to consider Kabir as an influence on Guru Nanak is wrong, both historically and theologically".&lt;ref name="Gandhi" /&gt;

McLeod places Nanak in the Sant tradition that included Kabir, and states that their fundamental doctrines were reproduced by Nanak. JS Grewal contests this view and states that McLeod's approach is limiting in its scope because, "McLeod takes into account only concepts, ignores practices altogether, he concentrates on similarities and ignores all differences".&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Grewal (2010), [http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v17_1-2/articles/JPS_17_nos_1-2_Grewal.pdf WH McLeod and Sikh Studies, Journal of Punjab Studies, Volume 17, Issue 1–2, page 119]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaishnavism versus other Hindu traditions==
The Vaishnavism sampradayas subscribe to various philosophies, are similar in some aspects and differ in others. When compared with Shaivism, Shaktism and Smartism, a similar range of similarities and differences emerge.&lt;ref name="JanGondaVandS"/&gt;

==Demography==
There is no data available on demographic history or trends for Vaishnavism or other traditions within Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-hindu/ The global religious landscape: Hindus], Pew Research (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates vary on the relative number of adherents in Vaishnavism compared to other traditions of Hinduism.

Similarly, Shaiva, Shakta and Smarta Hindus revere Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius J. Lipner]] (2009), Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-45677-7}}, pages 40-41, 302-315, 371-375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gavin Flood|title=The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SKBxa-MNqA8C|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-99868-7|pages=200–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishnaism has a limited following outside of India, especially associated with 1960s counter-culture, including a number of celebrity followers, such as [[George Harrison]], due to its promulgation throughout the world by the founder-acharya of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON) [[A.C.

==Academic study==
Vaishnava theology has been a subject of study and debate for many devotees, philosophers and scholars within [[India]] for centuries. Vaishnavism has its own academic wing in [[University of Madras]] - Department of Vaishnavism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unom.ac.in/index.php?route=department/department/deptpage&amp;deptid=73&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades this study has also been pursued in a number of academic institutions in Europe, such as the [[Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies]], [[Bhaktivedanta College]], and Syanandura Vaishnava Sabha, a moderate and progressive Vaishnava body headed by Gautham Padmanabhan in Trivandrum which intends to bring about a single and precise book called ''Hari-grantha'' to include all Vaishnava philosophies.

'''Vicar of Christ''' (from [[Latin]] ''Vicarius Christi'') is a term used in different ways and with different [[Theology|theological]] connotations throughout history. The original notion of a vicar is as an "earthly representative of [[Christ]]", but it's also used in the sense of "person acting as parish priest in place of a real person."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=vicar Online Etymology Dictionary - Vicar]&lt;/ref&gt; The title is now used in [[Catholicism]] to refer to the [[bishop]]s&lt;ref name="Lumen gentium"/&gt; and more specifically to the [[Pope#Vicar of Jesus Christ|Bishop of Rome]] (the pope).&lt;ref name= "New Advent - Vicar of Christ"/&gt;

== History and different uses ==
During the [[history of Christianity]], the title of Vicar of Christ was used in different ways, with implications for theological, pastoral or different time.

=== Use for the bishops ===
The first record of the concept of the Vicar of Christ is mentioned in the [[Epistle to the Magnesians]] of [[Ignatius of Antioch|St. Ignatius]], [[Bishop of Antioch]], who was possibly a disciple of both [[John the Apostle]] and [[Saint Peter]],&lt;ref&gt;RAY, Stephen. Upon this Rock. San Francisco, CA: Ignatius Press, 1999. p.119.&lt;/ref&gt; with a pastoral sense, written between the years 88 and 107 AD "''your bishop presides in the place of God (...)".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0105.htm| last = | first = | title = The Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians (2, 6:1)| accessdate=2010-01-27 | work = Catholic Encyclopedia; New Advent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ignatius did not explicitly use the term Vicar of Christ, he clearly sets out the concept. More recently, the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s Dogmatic Constitution on the Church ''Lumen gentium'' noted that bishops are "vicars and ambassadors of Christ,"&lt;ref name="Lumen gentium"&gt;{{cite web

 |archivedate=September 6, 2014 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] notes that each bishop governs his diocese "[a]s Christ's vicar."&lt;ref name="Catechism"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P4U.HTM#2.2.3.6.3.1560
| last = | first = | title = Catechism of the Catholic Church &amp;para;&amp;nbsp;1560
 | accessdate=2012-12-04 | work = Site da Santa Sé}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second recorded use of the term "Vicar of Christ" is found in the epistles of [[Tertullian]] in the 3rd century, with a different theological slant to refer to the [[Holy Spirit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0311.htm
| last = | first = | title = Prescription against Heretics (Chapter 28) | accessdate=2010-01-27 | work = Catholic Encyclopedia; New Advent}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, as Christ is not physically performing miracles in the Church, Holy Spirit acts as his Vicar on his behalf, performing miracles and preventing the Church err.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0403.htm
| last = | first = | title = On the Veiling of Virgins (Chapter 1) | accessdate=2010-01-27 | work = Catholic Encyclopedia; New Advent}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown whether this term was widely used in the early Church, or whether it was a personal theological observation of Tertullian.

=== Use for the Popes ===
[[File:V&amp;A - Raphael, Christ's Charge to Peter (1515).jpg|thumb|440px|''Christ's Charge to Peter'' by [[Raphael]], 1515. Catholics believe that in telling Peter to feed his sheep, Christ was entrusting to the papacy the responsibility of caring for the Church.]]
The third use of the term Vicar of Christ appears in the 5th century, in a [[synod]] of bishops to refer to [[Pope Gelasius I]]. The theological connotations of the title got a pastoral sense, evoking the words of Christ to the [[Apostle Peter]], regarded by the first Catholic Pope in ''John 21:16-17'', "''Feed my lambs... Feed my sheep''", so Christ made Peter his vicar and pastor with the responsibility to feed his flock (i.e. the Church) in his own place.&lt;ref name= "New Advent - Vicar of Christ"/&gt;

However, the use of the title to refer to the popes in the early Church was unstable, and several variants of the use of Vicar were used for the Pope, as "Vicar of Peter", indicating that they were the successors of St. Peter, "Vicar of the Prince of the Apostles" or "Vicar of the Apostolic See",&lt;ref name= "New Advent - Vicar of Christ"/&gt; among other variants. This title is used by the [[Roman Missal]] in their prayers for a dead pope,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.usccb.org/liturgy/papalnotes.pdf
| last = | first = | title = Liturgical Notes and Resource Materials for Use upon the Death of a Pope | accessdate=2010-01-27 | work = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the oath of allegiance to [[St. Boniface]] to [[Pope Gregory II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.montfort.org.br/index.php?secao=cartas&amp;subsecao=historia&amp;artigo=20090724182931

(cap. "Inter corporalia", 2, "De trans. ep.")&lt;ref name= "New Advent - Vicar of Christ"/&gt;
Occasionally, Popes like [[Pope Nicholas III|Nicholas III]] used "Vicar of God" as an equivalent title)&lt;ref name= "New Advent - Vicar of Christ"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403b.htm| last = | first = | title = Vicar of Christ | accessdate=2010-01-27 | work = Catholic Encyclopedia; New Advent}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 edition of the [[Annuario Pontificio]] gives "Vicar of Jesus Christ" as the second official title of the Pope (the first being "Bishop of Rome").&lt;ref&gt;Annuario Pontificio, published annually by Libreria Editrice Vaticana, edition of 2012 ({{ISBN|978-88-209-8722-0}}), p. 23*.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use in Caesaropapism ===
Another use of the title, with a different meaning, appeared in the [[Eastern Churches]], in use between the century fifth and sixth, the term was used to refer to the [[Byzantine emperor]],&lt;ref name= "Code of Canon Law"&gt;{{cite book| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=X5rcnhLnRYMC&amp;dq=%22vicarius+petri%22&amp;q=vicarius+petri#v=snippet&amp;q=vicarius%20petri&amp;f=false
| last = | first = | title = New commentary on the Code of Canon Law
 | accessdate=2010-01-27 | work = }}&lt;/ref&gt; showing the apex of [[caesaropapism]]. Though decisions on doctrine, liturgy and spirituality were left to the bishops,&lt;ref name= "Jeffrey"&gt;Richards, Jeffrey. ''The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476–752'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979) pp. 14–15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; (notably in [[Church Councils]], where the Emperor often played a key role, already since the time of Constantine the Great) the Emperor constantly had tremendous influence on the church, which was increasingly charged with tasks in the service of the crown, such as supervising temporal authorities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1242">In [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]], '''Wurrunna''' is a [[culture hero]].

The [[Dreamtime]] story of the [[black swan]]s tells how two brothers were turned into white swans so they could help an attack party during a raid for weapons. It is said that '''Wurrunna''' used a large [[gubbera]], or crystal stone to transform the men. After the raid, eaglehawks attacked the white swans and tore feathers from the birds. Crows who were enemies of the eaglehawks came to the aid of the brothers and gave the black swans their own black feathers. The black swan red beak is said to be the blood of the attacked brothers, which stayed there forever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.didgeridoos.net.au/dreamtime%20stories/swans.html THE BLACK SWANS] (extracted from Australian Legendary Tales, by [[K Langloh Parker]]).
