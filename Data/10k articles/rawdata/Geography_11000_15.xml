'''Anthony Bebbington''' (born 1962) is a geographer, Laureate Professor at the School of Geography, [[University of Melbourne]], Australia. He was previously Professor and Director of the Graduate School of Geography, [[Clark University]], USA and Professor at the [[University of Manchester]], UK.

==Background==
Tony Bebbington was born in [[Staffordshire, England]], studied [[Department of Geography, University of Cambridge|geography]] and [[land economy]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] where he graduated with distinction, and completed a PhD at the Graduate School of Geography, [[Clark University]], USA in 1990, supervised by [[Billie Lee Turner II]]. He holds British and American citizenship.

He held a postdoctoral appointment in Latin American Studies at Cambridge (1989-1992), before working at two London research organizations: the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (1992-4) and the [[International Institute for Environment and Development]] (1994-5). He moved to the USA again in 1995, working at the [[World Bank]] (1995-6, 1999-2000) and as Associate Professor of Geography, University of Colorado, Boulder (1996-2003) before moving to Manchester.

==Contributions==
Bebbington's early work was on farmer knowledge, livelihoods, and agrarian change in mountain communities of Peru and Ecuador. He made distinctive contributions to human geography and to understanding of rural development in the Andes, combining detailed fieldwork with farming households with broader understanding of rural institutions and social movements. He has retained an interest in theory, scholarship, and practical development issues. 

This interest in rural organizations and social movements led to research on the performance and practice on non-governmental organizations in Latin America, expressed in several books on NGOs and their contributions to development.  After working in social policy at the [[World Bank]], he became interested in how the World Bank works with NGOs, and particularly the use of '[[social capital]]' in the World Bank's work. 
Recent studies have been of mining, development, and the state in Peru and Ecuador, and the nature of protest surrounding mining proposals, funded by an ESRC research professorship, ARC Laureate Fellowship, and other grants.

He has worked most often in the Andes, elsewhere in South and Central America, and briefly in Indonesia and Nepal. 

Bebbington has also collaborated with [[United Nations Research Institute For Social Development]] on the flagship report Combating Poverty and Inequality (2010); a project for which he wrote a background thematic paper [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/27cd/f82d3ad29f399af7cbcca53c24c8be5b8392.pdf ''Poverty Reduction and Social Movements: A Framework with Cases'']. Additionally, he collaborated on the project ''Financing Social Policy'' (2006-2010).

The '''Atlantic Forest''' ({{lang-pt|Mata Atlântica}}) is a [[South America]]n [[forest]] that extends along the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of [[Brazil]] from [[Rio Grande do Norte]] state in the north to [[Rio Grande do Sul]] state in the south, and inland as far as [[Paraguay]] and the [[Misiones Province]] of [[Argentina]], where the region is known as '''Selva Misionera'''.

The Atlantic Forest has [[terrestrial ecoregion|ecoregion]]s within the following biome categories: [[seasonal tropical forest|seasonal moist]] and [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|dry]] broad-leaf tropical forests, [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]], and [[Mangrove|mangrove forests]]. The Atlantic Forest is characterized by a high [[biodiversity]] and [[endemism]].&lt;ref&gt;Dafonseca, G. 1985. The Vanishing Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Biological Conservation 34:17-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first environment that the Portuguese colonists encountered over 500 years ago, when it was thought to have had an area of {{convert|1000000|&amp;ndash;|1500000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, and stretching an unknown distance inland.&lt;ref&gt;Por, Francis Dov. 1992. Sooretama: the Atlantic rain forest of Brazil. The Hague: SPB Academic Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 85% of the original area has been [[deforestation|deforested]], threatening many [[flora|plant]] and [[fauna|animal]] species with [[extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Atlantic Forest|url=http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/southamerica/brazil/placesweprotect/atlantic-forest.xml|website=The Nature Conservancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atlantic Forests, South America|url=http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/atlantic_forests/|website=WWF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
The Atlantic Forest region includes forests of several variations:
* [[Restinga]] is a forest type that grows on stabilized coastal dunes.  Restinga Forests are generally closed [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] short forests with tree density.  Open Restinga is an open, [[savanna]]-like formation with scattered clumps of small trees and shrubs and an extensive layer of herbs, grasses, and [[sedges]].&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;Thomas, William Wayt, and Elizabeth G. Britton. 2008. The Atlantic coastal forest of Northeastern Brazil. Bronx, N.Y.: The New York Botanical Garden Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Seasonal tropical forest|Seasonal tropical moist forests]] may receive more than 2000&amp;nbsp;mm of rain a year. These include Tropical Moist: Lowland Forests, Submontane Forest, and [[Montane forest#Subtropical and tropical climate|Montane Forests]].&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;
* [[Tabuleiro forests]] are found over very moist clay soils and [[Tabuleiro Savannas]] occur over faster-draining sand soils.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt; These are humid areas that rely on water vapor from the ocean.&lt;ref name="Galindo" &gt;Galindo Leal, Carlos, and Ibsen de Gusmão Câmara. 2003. The Atlantic Forest of South America: biodiversity status, threats, and outlook. Washington: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Further inland are the [[Atlantic dry forests]], which form a transition between the arid [[Caatinga]] to the northeast and the [[Cerrado]] savannas to the east. These forests are lower in stature; more open, with high abundance of [[deciduous]] trees and lower diversity when compared to tropical moist forests. These forests have between 700–1600&amp;nbsp;mm of precipitation annually with a distinct dry season.  This includes Deciduous and Semideciduous Seasonal Forest each with their own lowland and montane regions.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Galindo" /&gt;
* [[Montane forests]] are higher altitude wet forests across mountains and plateaus of southern Brazil.
* The Mussununga forests occur in southern [[Bahia]] and northern [[Espirito Santo]] states. The Mussununga ecosystem ranges from grasslands to woodlands associated with sandy [[spodosols]]. The word ''Mussununga'' is Amerindian [[Tupi-Guarani]] meaning soft and wet white sand.{{sfn|Saporetti-Junior et al|2011}}
* Shrubby montane [[savannas]] occur at the highest elevations, also called [[Campo rupestre]].
 
The Atlantic Forest is unusual in that it extends as a true [[tropical rain forest]] to latitudes as far as 28°S. This is because the [[trade winds]] produce precipitation throughout the southern winter. In fact, the northern Zona da Mata of northeastern Brazil receives much more rainfall between May and August than during the southern summer.
The geographic range of Atlantic Forest vary depending on author or institution that published them. Information on four most important  boundaries as well as their union and intersection was reviewed in 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muylaert|first=Renata Lara|last2=Vancine|first2=Maurício Humberto|last3=Bernardo|first3=Rodrigo|last4=Oshima|first4=Júlia Emi Faria|last5=Sobral-Souza|first5=Thadeu|last6=Tonetti|first6=Vinicius Rodrigues|last7=Niebuhr|first7=Bernardo Brandão|last8=Ribeiro|first8=Milton Cezar|date=2018-09-11|title=UMA NOTA SOBRE OS LIMITES TERRITORIAIS DA MATA ATLÂNTICA|url=https://revistas.ufrj.br/index.php/oa/article/view/14317|journal=Oecologia Australis|language=pt|volume=22|issue=03|pages=302–311|doi=10.4257/oeco.2018.2203.09|issn=2177-6199}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Geography==
{{Empty section|date=July 2014}}

==History==
During glacial periods in the [[Pleistocene]], the Atlantic Forest is known to have shrunk to extremely small fragmented refugia in highly sheltered gullies, being separated by areas of dry forest or semi-deserts known as caatingas.&lt;ref name="Galindo" /&gt; Some maps even suggest the forest actually survived in moist pockets well away from the coastline where its endemic rainforest species mixed with much cooler-climate species. Unlike [[refugium (population biology)|refugia]] for equatorial rainforests, the refuges for the Atlantic Forest have never been the product of detailed identification.

==Biodiversity==
Despite having only 28% of native vegetation cover remaining&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rezende|first=C.L.|last2=Scarano|first2=F.R.|last3=Assad|first3=E.D.|last4=Joly|first4=C.A.|last5=Metzger|first5=J.P.|last6=Strassburg|first6=B.B.N.|last7=Tabarelli|first7=M.|last8=Fonseca|first8=G.A.|last9=Mittermeier|first9=R.A.|date=October 2018|title=From hotspot to hopespot: An opportunity for the Brazilian Atlantic Forest|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pecon.2018.10.002|journal=Perspectives in Ecology and Conservation|volume=16|issue=4|pages=208–214|doi=10.1016/j.pecon.2018.10.002|issn=2530-0644}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Atlantic Forest remains extraordinarily lush in [[biodiversity]] and [[endemic species]], many of which are threatened with [[extinction]]. Approximately 40 percent of its [[vascular plants]] and up 60 percent of its [[vertebrates]] are endemic species, meaning they are found nowhere else in the world.&lt;ref name="Tabarelli5"&gt;Tabarelli, Marcelo, Antonio Venceslau Aguiar, Milton Cezar Ribeiro, Jean Paul Metzger, and Carlos A. Peres. "Prospects for Biodiversity Conservation in the Atlantic Forest: Lessons from Aging Human-modified Landscapes." Biological Conservation 143.10 (2010): 2328-340.&lt;/ref&gt; The official threatened species list of Brazil contains over 140 terrestrial mammal species found in Atlantic Forest. In Paraguay there are 35 species listed as threatened, and 22 species are listed as threatened in the interior portion of the Atlantic Forest of Argentina. Nearly 250 species of [[amphibians]], birds, and mammals have become extinct due to the result of human activity in the past 400 years. Over 11,000 species of plants and animals are considered threatened today in the Atlantic Forest.&lt;ref name="Galindo" /&gt;

Over 52% of the tree species and 92% of the amphibians are endemic to this area. The forest harbors around 20,000 species of plants, with almost 450 tree species being found in just one hectare in some occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/atlantic_forests.cfm World Wildlife Fund: Atlantic Forest]. World Wildlife Fund. 29 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

New species are continually being found in the Atlantic Forest. In fact, between 1990 and 2006 over a thousand new [[flowering plant]]s were discovered.

[[File:Hillside deforestation in Rio de Janeiro.jpg|thumb|Deforestation of Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro]]The incorporation of modern human societies and their needs for forest resources has greatly reduced the size of the Atlantic Forest, which has resulted in species impoverishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FB%3ABIOC.0000019398.36045.1b | title=Forest Fragmentation, Synergisms and the Impoverishment of Neotropical Forests |author1=Tabarelli, Marcelo |author2=José Maria Cardoso Da Silva |author3=Claude Gascon  |last-author-amp=yes | journal=Biodiversity and Conservation |date=June 2004  | volume=13 | issue=7 | pages=1419–1425 | doi=10.1023/B:BIOC.0000019398.36045.1b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 88% of the original forest habitat has been lost and replaced by human-modified landscapes including [[pastures]], [[croplands]], and [[urban areas]]. This [[deforestation]] continues at an annual rate of .5% and up to 2.9% in urban areas. 
:'''Agriculture:'''  A major portion of human [[land use]] in the Atlantic Rain Forest is for [[agriculture]]. Crops include [[sugar-cane]], [[coffee plant|coffee]], [[tea plant|tea]], [[tobacco plant|tobacco]] and more recently soybean and [[biofuel crops]].&lt;ref name="Tabarelli5" /&gt;
:'''Pasture:''' Even more common than using land for agriculture is the [[Deforestation|conversion]] of forest to cattle pastures.&lt;ref name="IIz"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol13/iss2/art3/ | title=Thirty Years of Human Demography and Land-Use Change in the Atlantic Forest of Misiones, Argentina: an Evaluation of the Forest Transition Model |author1=IIzquierdo, Andrea E. |author2=Carlos D. De Angelo |author3=T. Mitchell Aide  |last-author-amp=yes | journal=[[Ecology and Society]] | year=2008 | volume=13 | issue=2 | pages=3. (online)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is commonly done by method of [[slash and burn]] which increases a forest chance of human-induced burning. 
:'''Hunting:''' Species in a fragmented forest are more susceptible to decline in [[population size]] because they are in an confined area that is more accessible to hunters. Larger animals make up the highest percentage of [[biomass]]. These animals are also the most rewarding to hunters and are heavily [[hunting|hunted]] in accessible fragments. This results in a change in species interactions such as [[seed dispersal]] and competition for resources.
:'''Logging:''' [[Logging]] removes 10 to 80% of the canopy cover of a forest making that habitat more susceptible to natural elements such as wind and sunlight. This causes an increase in forest heating and [[desiccation]].&lt;ref name="Laurance"&gt;[[Laurance, William F.]], and Diana C. Useche. "Environmental Synergisms and Extinctions of Tropical Species." ''Conservation Biology'' 23.6 (2009): 1427-437.&lt;/ref&gt; Large amounts of organic litter and debris builds up which results in an increase in forests vulnerability to [[forest fire|fires]]. Additionally, logging roads create accessibility for humans; and therefore increases the amount of human land disturbances and decreases the amount of natural forest.&lt;ref name="Laurance" /&gt;
:'''Fire:''' Human activity such as logging causes an increase in debris along forest floors that makes the Atlantic Forest more susceptible to fires. This is a forest type that is not accustomed to regular fire activity, so human induced fires dramatically affect the forest understory because plants do not have fire adaptations. In result, the forest becomes even more vulnerable to secondary fires, which are far more destructive and kill many more species including large trees.&lt;ref name="Laurance" /&gt;

====Results of human activity====
[[Habitat fragmentation]] leads to a cascade of alterations of the original forest landscape.&lt;ref name="Tabarelli5" /&gt; For example, the extent of human disturbances, including [[habitat destruction]], in the Atlantic Forest has led to an extinction crisis.&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;Brooks, Thomas M., Mittermeier, Russell A., Mittermeier, Cristina G., Da Fonseca, Gustavo A. B., Konstant, William R., Flick, Penny, Pilgrim, John, [[Sara Oldfield|Oldfield, Sara]], Magin, Georgina, Hilton-Taylor, Craig. “Habitat Loss and Extinction in the Hotspots of Biodiversity.” Pérdida de Hábitat y Extinciones en Áreas Críticas para la Biodiversidad 16.4 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The endemic species in this region are especially vulnerable to extinction due to fragmentation because of their small geographic ranges and low occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, B.D. &amp; W. Atmar. "Analyzing species composition in fragments." ''Bonner Zoologische Monographen'' 46 (2000): Pp. 9-24.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of the Atlantic Forest fragments, community level biomass was reduced to 60% in plots less than 25 hectares.&lt;ref name="Putz"&gt;Pütz, J. Groeneveld, L.F. Alves, J.P. Metzger, A. Huth. "Fragmentation drives tropical forest fragments to early successional states: A modelling study for Brazilian Atlantic forests." ''Ecological Modelling'', 222. 12 (2011), pp. 1986-1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Key ecological processes such as [[seed dispersal]], [[gene flow]], colonization and other processes are disturbed by fragmentation.&lt;ref name="Putz" /&gt; With many key vertebrate seed dispersers going extinct, it is predicted that many regional, fruit-bearing tree species in the Atlantic forest will become extinct due to failure of seedling recruitment and recolonisation.&lt;ref name="IIz" /&gt; With all these species already threatened, it is predicted that with the persistence of current deforestation rates the Atlantic forest will see continued extinction of species.&lt;ref name="Brooks" /&gt;

===Conservation by nongovernmental organizations===
Due to the Atlantic Forest’s vast diversity of endemic plants and animals as well as the fragmentation affecting these species, many groups and organizations are working towards the restoration of this unique [[ecosystem]].  [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGO) are huge benefactors in Brazil, providing funding as well as professional help to the Atlantic Forest due to the [[Brazilian Environmental Movement]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/Hotspots/atlantic_forest/pages/conservation.aspx Biodiversity Hotspots - Atlantic Forest - Conservation Action] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323223759/http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/Hotspots/atlantic_forest/pages/conservation.aspx |date=March 23, 2012 }}. ''[[Biodiversity Hotspots]]'' - Home. 03 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; One organization, called [[BirdLife International]], is using their research to preserve bird biodiversity of the area by primarily working with people towards sustainability in the use of natural resources.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Some organizations are receiving grants from the [[Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund]] (CEPF) if they abide by their directions.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; These include:
:* Species protection program
:* The Program for Supporting Private Natural Heritage Reserves
:* The Institutional Strengthening Program

Another strategy being implemented to maintain biodiversity within the Atlantic Forest is creating [[wildlife corridor]]s. The [[World Bank]] is donating $44 million to create a corridor, which will be known as the [[Central Biodiversity Corridor]], in the Atlantic Forest and one in the Amazon.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; The [[BNDES|Brazilian Development Bank]] has been financing, with non-reimbursable loans, 16 to 18 ecosystem restoration projects totaling 3,500 hectares and costing approximately $22 million under the so-called Iniciativa BNDES Mata Atlântica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bndes.gov.br/SiteBNDES/bndes/bndes_pt/Areas_de_Atuacao/Meio_Ambiente/Mata_Atlantica/index.html Iniciativa BNDES Mata Atlântica]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to preserve diversity, the state of [[Sao Paulo]] has created the [[Restinga de Bertioga State Park]], a 9.3 thousand hectares park which also serves as a wildlife corridor linking the coastal regions to the Serra do Mar mountain range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwf.org.br/informacoes/english/?27046/So-Paulo-expands-Atlantic-Forest-protection-coverage São Paulo Expands Atlantic Forest Protection Coverage]. [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] Brasil. 03 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some organizations, such as the [[Nature Conservancy]], are planning to restore parts of the forest that have been lost and to build corridors that are compatible with the lifestyles of the native people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/southamerica/brazil/placesweprotect/atlantic-forest.xml About the Atlantic Forest in Brazil]. Nature Conservancy | Protecting Nature, Preserving Life. 03 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Amazon Institute]] is active in reforestation efforts in the northeastern state of [[Pernambuco]], Brazil. During 2007, Joao Milanez and Joanne Stanulonis have planted 5,500 new trees in the mountains commencing with Gravata, adding to the precious little, ancient forest left.

The Pact for Atlantic Forest Restoration has assembled over 100 businesses, nongovernmental and governmental organizations around the goal of having 15 million hectares of the original ecosystem restored by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pactomataatlantica.org.br Pact for Atlantic Forest Restoration]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul]] keeps a private reserve of the [[Araucaria moist forest]] ecoregion of approximately 3.100 ha called [[Pró-Mata]], near the city of [[São Francisco de Paula, Rio Grande do Sul|São Francisco de Paula]] in the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. This reserve is used for research and biodiversity conservation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10492">{{short description|Digital representation of spatio-temporal phenomenon}}
A '''coverage''' is the digital representation of some spatio-temporal phenomenon. [[ISO 19123]] provides the definition:
* ''[a] feature that acts as a function to return values from its range for any direct position within its spatial, temporal or spatiotemporal domain''
Coverages play an important role in [[geographic information system]]s (GIS), [[geospatial]] content and services, [[Geographic information system|GIS]] [[data processing]], and data sharing.

A coverage is represented by its "domain" (the universe of extent) and a collection representing the coverage's values at each defined location within its range. For example, a [[satellite]] image derived from [[remote sensing]] might record varying degrees of [[light pollution]]. [[Aerial photography]], land cover data, and [[digital elevation model]]s all provide '''coverage data'''. Generally, a coverage can be multi-dimensional, such as 1-D sensor timeseries, 2-D satellite images, 3-D x/y/t image [[time series]] or x/y/z geo [[Tomography|tomograms]], or 4-D x/y/z/t climate and ocean data.

However, coverages are more general than just regularly gridded imagery. The corresponding standards (see below) address regular and irregular grids, point clouds, and general meshes.

An interoperable service definition for navigating, accessing, processing, and aggregation of coverages is provided by the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC) [[Web Coverage Service]] (WCS) suite and [[Web Coverage Processing Service]] (WCPS), a spatio-temporal coverage query language.

== Standards ==

Coverages represent digital geospatial information representing space/time-varying phenomena. OGC Abstract Topic 6&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=19820 Topic 6 - Schema for coverage geometry and functions, OGC 07-011]&lt;/ref&gt; - which is identical to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 19123 - defines an abstract model of coverages. 
Many implementations are conceivable which all conform to this abstract model while not being interoperable.
This abstract coverage model is concretized to the level of interoperability by the OGC standard '''GML 3.2.1 Application Schema - Coverages'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=48553 OGC GML Application Schema - Coverages, OGC 09-146r2]&lt;/ref&gt; (often referred to as '''GMLCOV''') which in turn is based on the '''Geography Markup Language''' (GML) 3.2,&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=20509 OpenGIS Geography Markup Language (GML) Encoding Standard, OGC 07-036]&lt;/ref&gt; an [[XML]] grammar written in XML Schema for the description of application schemas as well as the transport and storage of geographic information.

The European legal framework for a unified Spatial Data Infrastructure, [[Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community|INSPIRE]], in its Annex II and III relies on the OGC definitions of coverages as well, but modifies them in places in a way making them less compatible and interoperable with the OGC standard. For example, components of the coverage concept are selectively recombined into new, different definitions of a coverage.

== Coverage model ==

Formally, in GMLCOV '''AbstractCoverage''' is a subtype of '''AbstractFeature''' (indicating its close relation).
An abstract coverage consists of the following components:
* coverage domain: the extent where valid values are available;
* range set: the set of values ("[[pixel]]s", "[[voxel]]s") the coverage consists of, together with their locations
* range type: a type definition of the range set values
* metadata: a slot where any kind of metadata can be added

This abstract coverage is refined into several concrete coverage types, which can be instantiated, for example:
* gridded coverages:
** '''GridCoverage''': a regular, equispaced grid which is not spatially referenced (like a raster image which has no geo coordinates associated)
** '''RectifiedGridCoverage''': a regular, equispaced grid which is spatially referenced (like a satellite image which does have geo coordinates associated)
** '''ReferenceableGridCoverage''': a grid which is not necessarily equispaced (like satellite image time series where images do not arrive at regular time intervals, or curvilinear grids following river estuaries)
* multi-feature coverages:
** '''MultiPointCoverage''': sets of values associated with points located in space/time ("point clouds")
** '''MultiCurveCoverage''': sets of values associated with curves located in space/time (such as trajectories)
** '''MultiSurfaceCoverage''': sets of values associated with surfaces located in space/time (such as iso-surfaces)
** '''MultiSolidCoverage''': sets of values associated with solids located in space/time (such as CAD objects)

Among the special cases which can be modeled by coverages are
* set of [[Thiessen polygon]]s, used to analyse spatially distributed data such as rainfall measurements
* triangulated irregular network (TIN), often used for terrain models

=== Relationship to Features ===

A coverage is a special kind of [[feature data|geographic feature]], with the distinguishing characteristics that other features have one particular value associated (such as a road number, which remains constant over all the road's extent) whereas a coverage typically conveys different values at different locations within its domain. [[ISO 19109]] (2nd Ed.) explains the relationship between features and coverages as follows (clause 7.2.2):
* ''Many aspects of the real-world may be represented as features whose properties are single-valued and static. These conventional features provide a model of the world in terms of discrete objects located in it. However, in some applications it is more useful to use a model focussing on the variation of property values in space and time, formalized as coverages. ''

Both viewpoints are required since they each express a fundamental meta-model of the world: as a space populated by things, or as a space within which properties vary. Furthermore, requirements relating to both viewpoints may occur in a single application, typically matching a data-flow: from observation through interpretation, and then elaboration and simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegigasforum.eu/cgi-bin/download.pl?f=545.pdf|year=2010|title=Data Harmonization - GEOSS AIP-3 Contribution|accessdate=2016-01-27|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.1840.4569|author1=A Woolf |author2=S J D Cox |author3=C Portele }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coverage encoding ==

[[File:Coverage encoding variants.png|thumb|350px|alt=Different coverage encodings|Different coverage encodings]]

The format-independent logical structure of coverages can be mapped to GML (such as for sensor time series) or to any of a series of data formats, such as [[GeoTIFF]], [[NetCDF]], [[HDF-EOS]], or [[National Imagery Transmission Format|NITF]].

As some of these encoding formats are not capable of incorporating all metadata making up a coverage, the coverage model foresees a [[MIME#Multipart messages|multipart]] [[MIME]] encoding (see Figure) where the first component encodes the coverage description (domain extent, range type, metadata, etc.) and the second part consists of the range set "payload" using some encoding format.

== Services ==

In Web services following the open [[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC]] standards, coverages can be used by various service types:
* [[Web Coverage Service]] which offers a simple access protocol for coverage subsetting, as well as optional advanced functionality
* [[Web Coverage Processing Service]] which offers a multi-dimensional coverage query language for ad hoc processing, fusion, aggregation, and filtering
* [[Web Feature Service]] (although coverages can only be served as a whole, making it unwieldy in face of the often high-volume coverages, like satellite maps)
* [[Web Processing Service]] which allows publishing any kind of algorithm through an advanced remote procedure call style protocol

==Industry Terminology: GIS format==
Early GIS systems were often characterised as either 'raster' or 'vector' systems, depending on the underlying approach to handling geometry. Raster GIS could be interpreted as using a regular discrete coverage model, while Vector GIS are more feature-oriented. The term "coverage" was most notably applied to the legacy [[ARC/INFO]] (ArcInfo) format developed by [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]]. At that time this was a novel concept, extending [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] formats into more spatially aware data that featured linked [[Attribute (computing)|attribute]]s. This usage was consistent with the coverage concept discussed here, in the sense that an ArcInfo coverage provided a one-to-one mapping from space to the thematic value or classification for each layer or coverage. However, ArcInfo coverages had a particular topological approach to ensure completeness and uniqueness, processed using the BUILD and CLEAN commands are 2D [[Planar (computer graphics)|planar]] datasets that maintain [[Geospatial topology|topological]] information, thus a polygon "knows" which segments of its perimeter it shares with adjacent polygons. Due to the lack of processing power in computing at the time of its development{{When|date=February 2011}}, the Coverage model employs indexed [[binary file]]s to store spatial and attribute data separately as opposed to utilizing a [[RDBMS]].&lt;ref&gt;Zeiler, Michael. Modeling Our World, The ESRI Guide to [[Geodatabase]] Design. ESRI Press, 1999. {{ISBN|1-879102-62-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has changed with the advent of raster database technology like [[rasdaman]] which makes efficient ad hoc filtering and processing feasible.&lt;ref&gt;Baumann, P.; Jucovschi, C.; Stancu-Mara, S.: [http://www.springerlink.com/content/5l63816622204711/ Efficient Map Portrayal Using a General-Purpose Query Language (A Case Study)].

'''The geographical center of Belarus''' ({{lang-be|Геаграфічны цэнтр Беларусі}}) is located in the [[Geographic coordinate system|geographical coordinates]] of [[latitude]] 53 ° 31'44, 54 ", [[longitude]] 28 ° 02'41, 90". Is 70-km south-east of Minsk, a 6-km west of Marina Hills, and 1&amp;nbsp;km to the south-east of the village Antonovo, [[Pukhovisky District]], [[Minsk Oblast]].

Search works were carried out in 1996, the 82nd expedition association "Belgeodesy" in cooperation with the firm "Aerogeokart" a special program using the 1:200 000 maps and satellites.

The geographical coordinates of the center of Belarus entered into the State Geodetic directory as the state geodetic grid points.

On May 1, 1996 near the village of Antonovo a  pillar was erected, written on it "The village Antonovo - the geographical center of the [[Belarus|Republic of Belarus]].

[[File:LocationEthiopia.svg|thumb|Location of Ethiopia]]

'''Ethiopia''' is located in the [[Horn of Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Eritrea]] to the north, [[Djibouti]] and [[Somalia]] to the east, [[Sudan]] and [[South Sudan]] to the west, and [[Kenya]] to the south. [[Ethiopia]] has a high central plateau that varies from {{convert|1290|to|3000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, with the highest mountain reaching {{convert|4533|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

Elevation is generally highest just before the point of descent to the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]], which splits the plateau diagonally. A number of rivers cross the plateau; notably the [[Blue Nile]] rising from [[Lake Tana]]. The plateau gradually slopes to the lowlands of the Sudan on the west and the Somali-inhabited plains to the east.

==Physical features==

=== Geography ===
[[File:Ethiopia Topography.png|thumb|300px|Ethiopia's topography]]
[[File:Ethiopia sat.png|thumb|300px|A satellite image of Ethiopia]]
Between the valley of the Upper [[Nile]] and Ethiopia's border with [[Sudan]] and South Sudan is a region of elevated [[plateau]]s from which rise the various tablelands and mountains that constitute the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. On nearly every side, the walls of the plateaus rise abruptly from the [[plain]]s, constituting outer mountain chains. The highlands are thus a clearly marked geographic division. In [[Eritrea]], the eastern wall of this plateau runs parallel to the [[Red Sea]] from [[Ras Kasar]] ([[18th parallel north|18° N]]) to [[Annesley Bay]] (also known as the Bay of [[Zula]]) ([[15th parallel north|15° N]]). It then turns due south into Ethiopia and follows closely the line of [[40th meridian east|40° E]] for some {{convert|600|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.

About [[9th parallel north|9° N]] there is a break in the wall, through which the [[Awash River]] flows eastward. The main range at this point trends southwest, while south of the Awash Valley, which is some {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below the level of the mountains, another [[massif]] rises in a direct line south. This second range sends a chain (the [[Ahmar Mountains]]&lt;!-- which the EB 1911 calls the "Harar hills" --&gt;) eastward toward the [[Gulf of Aden]].

The two chief eastern ranges maintain a parallel course south by west, with a broad upland valley in between — in which valley are a series of lakes — to about [[3rd parallel north|3° N]], the outer (eastern) spurs of the plateau still keeping along the line of [[40th meridian east|40° E]]. The southern escarpment of the plateau is highly irregular, but has a general direction northwest and southeast from [[6th parallel north|6° N]] to [[3rd parallel north|3° N]]. It overlooks the depression in which is [[Lake Turkana]] and — east of that lake — the southern [[Debub Omo Zone]] (part of the larger [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region]]).

The western wall of the plateau from [[6th parallel north|6° N]] to [[11th parallel north|11° N]] is well marked and precipitous. North of [[11th parallel north|11° N]] the hills turn more to the east and fall more gradually to the [[East Sudanian savanna]] plains at their base. On its northern face the plateau falls in terraces to the level of the eastern [[Sudan]].

The eastern escarpment is the best defined of these outer ranges. It has a mean height of {{convert|2100|to|2400|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and in many places rises almost perpendicularly from the plain. Narrow and deep clefts, through which descend mountain torrents that lose themselves in the sandy soil of the Eritrean coast, afford means of reaching the plateau, or the easier route through the Awash Valley may be chosen. On surmounting this rocky barrier, the traveller finds that the encircling rampart rises little above the normal level of the plateau.

The physical aspect of the highlands is impressive. The northern portion lies mainly between [[10th parallel north|10°]] and [[15th parallel north|15° N]]. It consists of a huge mass of [[Archean|Archaean]] rocks with a mean height of {{convert|2000|to|2200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, and is flooded in a deep central depression by the waters of [[Lake Tana]]. Above the plateau rise several irregular and generally ill-defined mountain ranges which attain altitudes of from {{convert|3700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to just under {{convert|4600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Many of the mountains are of unusual shape.

Characteristic of the country are the enormous [[canyon|fissures]] which divide it, formed over time by the [[erosion|erosive]] action of water. They are the valleys of the rivers, which rising on the uplands or mountain sides, have cut their way to the surrounding lowlands. Some of the valleys are of considerable width; in other cases the opposite walls of the gorges are but two or three hundred meters apart, and fall almost vertically thousands of meters, representing an erosion of many hundred thousands cubic metres of hard rock. One result of the action of the water has been the formation of numerous isolated flat-topped hills or small plateaus, known as ''[[amba (geology)|ambas]]'', with nearly perpendicular sides.

The highest peaks are found in the [[Semien Mountains|Semien]] and [[Bale Mountains|Bale]] ranges. The Semien Mountains lie northeast of Lake Tana and culminate in the snow-covered peak of [[Ras Dashen]], which has an altitude of {{convert|4550|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. A few kilometers east and north respectively of Ras Dejen are Mounts [[Mount Biuat|Biuat]] and [[Mount Abba Yared|Abba Yared]], whose summits are less than {{convert|100|m|ft|0|sp=us}} below that of Ras Dejen.

The Bale Mountains are separated from the larger part of the Ethiopian highlands by the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]], one of the longest and most profound chasms in Ethiopia. The highest peaks of that range include [[Mount Tullu Demtu|Tullu Demtu]], the second-highest mountain in Ethiopia ({{convert|4377|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Mount Batu|Batu]] ({{convert|4307|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Mount Chilalo|Chilalo]] ({{convert|4036|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Mount Kaka]] ({{convert|3820|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

Parallel with the eastern escarpment are the heights of [[Mount Biala|Biala]], {{convert|3810|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, [[Mount Abuna Yosef]], {{convert|4190|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and [[Kollo]], {{convert|4300|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, the last-named being southwest &lt;!-- my map shows it NE --&gt; of [[Magdala, Ethiopia|Magdala]]. Between Lake Tana and the eastern hills are Mounts [[Mount Guna|Guna]], {{convert|4210|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and [[Mount Uara Sahia|Uara Sahia]], {{convert|3960|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. In the [[Choqa Mountains]] of [[Misraq Gojjam Zone|Misraq Gojjam]], [[Mount Choqa]] (also known as Mount Birhan) attains a height of  {{convert|4154|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

Below [[10th parallel north|10° N]], the southern portion of the highlands has more open tableland than the northern portion and fewer lofty peaks. Though there are a few heights between {{convert|3000|and|4000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, the majority do not exceed {{convert|2400|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, but the general character of the southern regions is the same as in the north: a much-broken hilly plateau.

East of the highlands towards the [[Red Sea]] there is a strip of lowland semi-desert, the [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]].

=== Hydrology ===
{{Further|List of rivers of Ethiopia}}
[[File:Awashrivermap.png|thumb|300px|A map of the [[Awash River]]]]
Most of the Ethiopian uplands have a decided slope to the northwest, so that nearly all the large rivers flow in that direction to the [[Nile]], comprising some 85% of its water. Such are the [[Tekezé River]] in the north, the [[Abay River|Abay]] in the center, and the [[Sobat River|Sobat]] in the south, and about four-fifths of the entire drainage is discharged through these three arteries. Another large river is the south-flowing [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Omo]], with 14% of the entire drainage the largest river outside the above-mentioned three main arteries discharging to the west, and by far the main feeder of the [[closed basin|endorheic]] [[Turkana Basin]] with [[Lake Turkana]]. The rest is carried off by the [[Awash River|Awash]], which runs out in the saline lacustrine district along the border with [[Djibouti]]; by the [[Shebelle River]] and the [[Jubba River|Jubba]], which flow southeast through [[Somalia]], though the Shebelle most often fails to reach the [[Indian Ocean]].

The Tekezé River, which is the true upper course of the [[Atbarah River]], has its headwaters in the central tableland; and falls from about {{convert|2100|to|750|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. in the tremendous crevasse through which it sweeps west, north, forming part of the border with Eritrea, and west again down to the western terraces, where it passes from Ethiopia to Sudan. During the rains the Tekezé (i.e. the "Terrible") rises some {{convert|5|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} above its normal level, and at this time forms an impassable barrier between the northern and central regions. In its lower course, the river is known by the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name [[Setit]].

In Sudan, the Setit is joined (at {{coord|14|20|N|35|51|E}}) by the Atbarah, a river formed by several streams which rise in the mountains west and northwest of [[Lake Tana]]. The Gash or [[Mareb River|Mareb]], which forms part of the border with [[Eritrea]], is the most northerly of the highland rivers which flow toward the Nile valley. Its headwaters rise on the landward side of the eastern escarpment within 80&amp;nbsp;km of Annesley Bay on the Red Sea. It reaches the Sudanese plains near [[Kassala]], beyond which place its waters are dissipated in the sandy soil. The Mareb is dry for a great part of the year, but like the Takazze is subject to sudden freshets during the rainy season. Only the left bank of the upper course of the river is in Ethiopian territory.

[[File:jubbarivermap.png|thumb|300px|A map of the [[Jubba River]] and [[Shebelle River]] drainage basin]]
The Abay — that is, the upper course of the Blue Nile — has its source near [[Mount Denguiza]] in the Choqa mountains, around {{coord|11|0|N|37|0|E}}. It first flows for {{convert|110|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} nearly due north to the south shore of Lake Tana. Tana, which stands {{convert|750|to|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below the normal level of the plateau, has somewhat the physical aspect of a flooded crater. It has an area of about {{convert|2800|km2|sqmi|0}}, and a depth in some parts of {{convert|75|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. At the southeast corner the rim of the crater is, as it were, breached by a deep crevasse through which the Abay escapes, and here makes a great semicircular bend like that of the Tekezé, but in the reverse direction — east, south and north-west — down to the plains of [[Sennar (state)|Sennar]], where it takes the name of Bahr-el-Azrak or [[Blue Nile]].

The Abay has many tributaries. Of these, the [[Bashilo River|Bashilo]] rises near Magdala and drains eastern [[Amhara Region|Amhara]]; the [[Jamma River|Jamma]] rises near Ankober and drains northern [[Shoa, Ethiopia|Shoa]]; the [[Muger River|Muger]] rises near [[Addis Ababa]] and drains south-western [[Shoa, Ethiopia|Shoa]]; the [[Didessa River|Didessa]], the largest of the Abay's affluents, rises in the [[Kaffa (city)|Kaffa]] hills and has a generally south-to-north course; the [[Dabus River|Dabus]] runs near the western edge of the plateau escarpment. All these are perennial rivers. The right-hand tributaries, rising mostly on the western sides of the plateau, have steep slopes and are generally torrential in character. The [[Beles River|Beles]], however, is perennial, and the [[Rahad River|Rahad]] and [[Dinder River|Dinder]] are important rivers in flood-time.

In the mountains and plateaus of [[Gambela Region|Gambela]] and Kaffa in southwestern Ethiopia rise the [[Baro River|Baro]], [[Gelo River|Gelo]], [[Akobo River|Akobo]] and other chief affluents of the Sobat tributary of the Nile. The Akobo, in about {{coord|7|47|N|33|3|E}}, joins the [[Pibor River|Pibor]], which in about {{coord|8|30|N|33|20|E}} unites with the Baro, the river below the confluence taking the name of Sobat. These rivers descend from the mountains in great falls, and like the other Ethiopian streams are unnavigable in their upper courses. The Baro on reaching the plain becomes, however, a navigable stream affording an open waterway to the Nile. The Baro, Pibor and Akobo form for {{convert|400|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} the western and southwestern frontiers of Ethiopia.

The chief river of Ethiopia flowing east is the [[Awash River]] (or Awasi), which rises in the Shewan uplands and makes a semicircular bend first southeast and then northeast. It reaches the [[Afar Depression]] through a broad breach in the eastern escarpment of the plateau, beyond which it is joined on its left bank by its chief affluent, the [[Germama river|Germama]] (Kasam), and then trends round in the direction of the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]]. Here the Awash is a copious stream nearly {{convert|60|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|1.2|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} deep, even in the dry season, and during the floods rising {{convert|15|to|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above low-water mark, thus inundating the plains for many kilometers along both its banks.

After a winding course of about {{convert|800|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, the Awash River passes (in its lower reaches) through a series of badds (lagoons) to [[Lake Abhe Bad]] (or Abhe Bid) on the border with Djibouti and some {{convert|100|to|110|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the head of the Gulf of Tadjoura. In this lake the Awash river is lost. This remarkable phenomenon is explained by the position of Abhe Bad in the centre of a saline lacustrine depression several hundred meters below sea level. While most of the other lagoons are highly saline, with thick incrustations of salt round their margins, Abhe Bad remains fresh throughout the year, owing to the great body of water discharged into it by the Awash.

Another lacustrine region extends from the Shoan heights southwest to the Samburu (Lake Turkana) depression. In this chain of scenic upland lakes — some fresh, some [[brackish water|brackish]], some completely closed, others connected by short channels — the chief links in their order from north to south are: [[Lake Zway|Zway]], communicating southwards with Hara and Lamina, all in the [[Arsi Zone]]; then [[Lake Abijatta|Abijatta]] with an outlet to a smaller turn to the Baroda and Gamo areas, skirted on the west sides by grassy slopes and wooded ranges from {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to nearly {{convert|3000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high; lastly, [[Lake Chew Bahir]] (formerly known as Lake Stephanie) which is completely closed and falling to a level of about {{convert|550|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level.

To the same system belongs the neighbouring Lake Turkana, which is larger than all the rest put together. This lake receives at its northern end the waters of the Omo, which rises in the Shoan highlands and is a perennial river with many affluents. In its course of some {{convert|600|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}  it has a total fall of about {{convert|700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, from {{convert|1060|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at its source to c. {{convert|360|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at lake level), and is consequently a rapid stream, being broken by the Kokobi and other falls, and navigable only for a short distance above its mouth. 

The chief rivers of Somalia, the Shebelle and the Jubba, have their rise on the south-eastern slopes of the Ethiopian escarpment as [[Shebelle]], [[Ganale Doria River]] and [[Dawa River]], and part of their course is through territory belonging to Ethiopia.

There are numerous [[hot spring]]s in Ethiopia, such as [[Sodere]].

==Geology==
{{main|Geology of Ethiopia}}
The [[East Africa]]n [[tableland]] is continued into Ethiopia. A pioneering study of the geology of Ethiopia was [[W. T. Blanford]]'s work in 1870. More recent work has focussed on the [[Afar Depression]], due to its importance as one of two places on Earth where a [[mid-ocean ridge]] can be studied on land (the other is [[Iceland]]).

The following formations are represented:

; [[Sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rocks|metamorphic]]
:* Recent: [[Coral]], [[alluvium]], [[sand]]
:* [[Tertiary]]: [[Limestone]]s of [[Harrar]]
:* [[Jurassic]]: [[Antalo]] Limestones
:* [[Triassic]]: [[Adigrat]] [[Sandstone]]s
:* [[Archean|Archaean]]: [[Gneiss]]es, [[schist]]s, [[slate|slaty]] rocks
; [[Igneous]]
:* Recent: [[Aden]] Volcanic Series
:* Tertiary, Cretaceous: [[Maqdala|Magdala]] group
:* Jurassic: [[Ashangi]] group

[[Archean|Archaean]].--The metamorphic rocks compose the main mass of the tableland, and are exposed in every deep valley in Tigre and along the valley of the Blue Nile. Mica schists form the prevalent rocks. Hornblende schist also occur and a compact felspathic rock in the Suris [[defile (geography)|defile]]. The foliae of the schists strike north and south.

[[Triassic]].--In the region of Adigrat the metamorphic rocks are invariably overlain by white and brown sandstones, unfossiliferous, and attaining a maximum thickness of 300&amp;nbsp;m. They are overlain by the fossiliferous limestones of the Antalo group. Around Chelga and Adigrat coal-bearing beds occur, which Blanford suggests may be of the same age as the coal-bearing strata of India. The Adigrat Sandstone possibly represents some portion of the [[Karoo System]] of South Africa.

[[Jurassic]].--The fossiliferous limestones of Antalo are generally horizontal, but are in places much disturbed when interstratified with trap rocks. The fossils are all characteristic Oolite forms and include species of Hemicidaris, Pholadomya, Ceromya, Trigonia and Alaria.

[[Igneous]] Rocks.--Above a height of {{convert|2,400|m|ft|abbr=on}} the country consists of bedded traps belonging to two distinct and unconformable groups. The lower (Ashangi group) consists of basalts and dolerites often amygdaloidal. Their relation to the Antalo limestones is uncertain, but Blanford considers them to be not later in age than the Oolite. The upper (Magdala group) contains much trachytic rock of considerable thickness, lying perfectly horizontally, and giving rise to a series of terraced ridges characteristic of central Ethiopia. They are interbedded with unfossiliferous sandstones and shales.

Of more recent date (probably Tertiary) are some igneous rocks, rich in alkalis, occurring in certain localities in southern Ethiopia. Of still more recent date are the basalts and ashes west of Massawa and around Annesley Bay and known as the Aden Volcanic Series. With regard to the older igneous rocks, the enormous amount they have suffered from denudation is a prominent feature. They have been worn into deep and narrow ravines, sometimes to a depth of {{convert|1,000|to|1,200|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

==Climate==
[[File:Köppen_climate_types_of_Ethiopia.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Köppen climate classification]] of Ethiopia]]
{{See also|Ethiopia#Climate}}

The climate is temperate on the plateau and hot in the lowlands. At [[Addis Ababa]], which ranges from  {{convert|2200|to|2600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, maximum temperature is {{convert|26|C|F|1}} and minimum {{convert|4|C|F|1}}. The weather is usually sunny and dry, but the short (''belg'') rains occur from February to April and the big (''meher'') rains from mid-June to mid-September.
The climate of Ethiopia and its dependent territories varies greatly.

The [[Somali Region]] and the [[Danakil Depression]] in the [[Afar (region)|Afar Region]] have a hot, sunny and dry climate producing fully desert or semi-desert conditions. The terrain in the lower basin of the [[Sobat River|Sobat]] is hot, swampy and malarious. However, over the greater part of Ethiopia as well as the [[Oromia]] highlands the climate is very healthy and temperate. The country lies wholly within the [[tropics]], but its nearness to the [[equator]] is counterbalanced by the elevation of the land. In the deep valleys of the [[Tekezé River|Tekezé]] and [[Abay River|Abay]], and generally in places below {{convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, the conditions are tropical and diseases such as [[malaria]] are prevalent.

In the uplands, the air is cool and bracing in summer, and in winter very bleak. The mean range of temperature is between {{convert|15|to|25|°C|°F}}. On the higher mountains the climate is [[Alpine climate|Alpine]] in character. The atmosphere on the plateaus is exceedingly clear, so that objects are easily recognizable at great distances. In addition to the variation in climate dependent on elevation, the year may be divided into three seasons. Winter, or the cold season, lasts from October to February. It is followed by a dry hot period, which about the middle of June gives place to the rainy season. The rain is heaviest in the Tekezé basin in July and August.

In the former provinces of [[Gojjam]] and [[Welega Province|Welega]], heavy rains continue till the middle of September. October is occasionally a wet month. There are also spring and winter rains; indeed rain often falls in every month of the year. But the rainy season proper, caused by the southwest monsoon, lasts from June to mid-September, and commencing in the north moves southward. In the region of the headwaters of the Sobat the rains begin earlier and last longer. The rainfall varies from about {{convert|750|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} a year in [[Tigray Region|Tigray]] and [[Amhara Region|Amhara]] to over {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in parts of Oromia.

The rainy season is of great importance not only to Ethiopia but to the countries of the Nile valley, as the prosperity of the eastern Sudan and [[Egypt]] is largely dependent upon the rainfall. A season of light rain may be sufficient for the needs of Ethiopia, but there is little surplus water to find its way to the Nile; and a shortness of rain means a low Nile, as practically all the flood water of that river is derived from the Ethiopian tributaries.

==Flora and fauna==

=== Flora ===
As in a day's journey the traveller may pass from tropical to almost Alpine conditions of climate, so great also is the range of the flora and fauna.
In the valleys and lowlands the vegetation is dense, but the general appearance of the plateaus is of a comparatively bare country with trees and bushes thinly scattered over it. The glens and ravines on the hillside are often thickly wooded, and offer a delightful contrast to the open downs.

These conditions are particularly characteristic of the northern regions; in the south the vegetation on the uplands is more luxuriant. Among the many varieties of trees and plants found are the date palm, [[mimosa]], wild [[olive]], giant [[sycamore]]s, [[juniper]]s and [[Antidesma bunius|laurels]], the [[myrrh]] and other gum trees (gnarled and stunted, these flourish most on the eastern foothills), a magnificent pine (the Natal yellow pine, which resists the attacks of the white ant&lt;!-- Podocarpus latifolius? --&gt;), the [[ficus|fig]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], [[Lime (Citrus aurantifolia)|lime]], [[pomegranate]], [[peach]], [[apricot]], [[banana]], and other fruit trees; the [[grape]] vine (rare), [[blackberry]], and [[raspberry]]; the [[cotton]] and indigo Plants, and occasionally the [[sugar cane]]. There are in the south large forests of valuable timber trees; and the coffee plant is indigenous in the [[Kingdom of Kaffa|Kaffa]] country, whence it takes its name.

Many kinds of [[Poaceae|grass]]es and [[flower]]s abound. Large areas are covered by the [[kosso]], a hardy member of the [[rose]] family, which grows from {{convert|2.5|to|3|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} high and has abundant pendent red blossoms. The flowers and the leaves of this plant are highly prized for medicinal purposes. The fruit of the [[hurarina]], a tree found almost exclusively in [[Shoa, Ethiopia|Shoa]], yields a black grain highly esteemed as a [[spice]]. On the tableland a great variety of [[cereal]]s and [[vegetable]]s are cultivated. A fibrous plant, known as the [[sansevieria]], grows in a wild state in the [[semi-desert]] regions of the north and south-east.

=== Fauna ===
In addition to the domestic animals enumerated below the fauna is very varied. [[Elephant]] can be found in certain low-lying districts, especially in the Sobat valley. The [[hippopotamus]] and [[crocodile]] inhabit the larger rivers flowing west, but are not found in the Hawash, in which, however, [[otter]]s of large size are plentiful. [[Lion]]s abound in the low countries and in Somaliland. In central Ethiopia the lion is no longer found except occasionally in the river valleys.

[[Leopard]]s, both spotted and black, are numerous and often of great size; [[hyena]]s are found everywhere and are hardy and fierce; the [[lynx]], [[wolf]], wild [[dog]] and [[jackal]] are also common. [[Boar]]s and [[badger (animal)|badger]]s are more rarely seen. The [[giraffe]] is found in the western districts, the [[zebra]] and wild ass frequent the lower plateaus and the rocky hills of the north. There are large herds of [[Bubalus|buffalo]] and [[antelope]], and [[gazelle]]s of many varieties and in great numbers are met with in most parts of the country.

Among the varieties are the greater and lesser [[kudu]] (both rather rare); the [[duiker]], [[gemsbuck]], [[hartebeest]], [[gerenuk]] (the most common—it has long thin legs and a camel-like neck); [[klipspringer]], found on the high plateaus as well as in the lower districts; and the [[dik-dik]], the smallest of the [[antelope]]s, its weight rarely exceeding {{convert|5|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, common in the low countries and the foothills. The [[African civet]] is found in many parts of Ethiopia, but chiefly in the [[Galla Placidia|Galla]] regions. [[Squirrel]]s and [[hare]]s are numerous, as are several kinds of [[monkey]]s, notably the [[guereza]], [[gelada]], [[guenon]] and dog-faced [[baboon]]. They range from the tropical lowlands to heights of {{convert|3000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

[[Bird]]s are very numerous, and many of them remarkable for the
beauty of their plumage. Great numbers of [[eagle]]s, [[vulture]]s, [[hawk]]s, bustards and other birds of prey are met with; and [[partridge]]s, [[duck]], [[teal]], [[guineafowl]], [[sandgrouse]], [[curlew]]s, [[woodcock]], [[snipe]], [[pigeon]]s, [[turdidae|thrush]]es and [[hirundinidae|swallows]] are very plentiful. A fine variety of [[ostrich]] is commonly found. Among the birds prized for their plumage are the marabout, [[crane (bird)|crane]], [[heron]], [[blacks bird]], [[parrot]] and [[jay]]s of extraordinary brilliance.

Among [[insect]]s the most numerous and useful is the [[bee]], [[honey]] everywhere constituting an important part of the food of the inhabitants. Of an opposite class is the [[locust]]. There are thousands of varieties of [[butterfly|butterflies]] and other insects. [[Snake]]s are not numerous, but several species are [[venom]]ous.

==Natural resources and land use==
Ethiopia has small reserves of gold, platinum, copper, potash, and natural gas.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; It has extensive hydropower potential.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

Of the total land area, about 20 percent is under cultivation, although the amount of potentially arable land is larger.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; Only about 10 to 15 percent of the land area is presently covered by forest as a result of [[Ethiopian deforestation|rapid deforestation]] during the last 30 years.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; Of the remainder, a large portion is used as pasturage. Some land is too rugged, dry, or infertile for agriculture or any other use.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

==Disputed border with Eritrea==
The border between Ethiopia and Eritrea has never been precisely demarcated.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Ethiopia.pdf Ethiopia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1998 and 2000, the two countries fought a war over the issue, which involves quite small enclaves along the northern segment of their border, including the tiny village of [[Badme]] and the enclave of the [[Irob people]].&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; In 2002 an international boundary commission delimited the border.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

Although both nations agreed to accept its decision, Ethiopia has refused to accept the commission’s findings in full, much to the consternation of the Eritrean government.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; The central section of Ethiopia’s border with Somalia also has never been fully demarcated and is only provisional.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; Questions remain about the precise location of small parcels along the border with Sudan as well.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

'''[[The Gambia]]''' is a very small and narrow country with the border based on the [[Gambia River]]. The country is less than 48&amp;nbsp;km wide at its greatest width. The country's present boundaries were defined in 1889 after an agreement between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]. It is often claimed by Gambians that the distance of the borders from the Gambia River corresponds to the area that British naval cannon of the time could reach from the river's channel. However, there is no historical evidence to support the story, and the border was actually delineated using careful surveying methods by the Franco-British boundary commission.&lt;ref&gt;Donald R. Wright (2004). ''The World and a Very Small Place: A History of Globalization in Niumi, The Gambia'' (New York: M.E. Sharp) p. 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig Emms and Linda Barnett (2001). ''Bradt Travel Guide for The Gambia'' (Chalford, UK: Bradt Travel Guides).&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from its coastline, where the Gambia borders the [[Atlantic Ocean]], it is an [[enclave]] of [[Senegal]] and is by far the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|smallest]] country on mainland [[Africa]].

==Climate==
The Gambia has a subtropical climate with distinct dry and rainy seasons.

From November to mid-May there is uninterrupted dry weather, with temperatures as low as {{convert|16|°C|1}} in [[Banjul]] and surrounding areas.

Hot, humid weather predominates the rest of the year, with a rainy season from June to October; during this period, temperatures may rise as high as {{convert|43|°C|1}} but are usually lower near the sea.

Mean temperatures range from {{convert|23|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|27|°C|1}} in June along the coast, and from {{convert|24|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|32|°C|1}} in May inland. The average annual rainfall ranges from {{convert|920|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the interior to {{convert|1450|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} along the coast.

==Terrain==
The grassy flood plain of the Gambia river contains [[Guinean mangroves]] near the coast, and becomes [[West Sudanian savanna]] upriver inland.

'''Hydrographic survey''' is the science of measurement and description of features which affect maritime navigation, marine construction, [[dredging]], [[Hydrocarbon exploration|offshore oil exploration]]/[[offshore oil drilling]] and related activities. Strong emphasis is placed on soundings, shorelines, tides, currents, [[seabed]] and submerged obstructions that relate to the previously mentioned activities.  The term ''hydrography'' is used synonymously to describe ''maritime [[cartography]]'', which in the final stages of the hydrographic process uses the raw data collected through hydrographic survey into information usable by the [[end user]].

[[Hydrography]] is collected under rules which vary depending on the acceptance authority.  Traditionally conducted by ships with a [[sounding line]] or  [[echo sounding]], surveys are increasingly conducted with the aid of aircraft and sophisticated electronic sensor systems in shallow waters.

==Organizations==

===National and International Maritime Hydrography===
{{main|Hydrographic office}}
Hydrographic offices evolved from naval heritage and are usually found within national naval structures, for example Spain's Instituto Hidrográfico de la Marina.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armada.mde.es/ArmadaPortal/page/Portal/ArmadaEspannola/ciencia_ihm_1/ | Armada Esapñola - Instituto Hidrográfico de la Marina&lt;/ref&gt;  Coordination of those organizations and product standardization is voluntarily joined with the goal of improving hydrography and safe navigation is conducted by the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO). The IHO publishes Standards and Specifications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/english/standards-publications/introduction.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724155623/http://www.iho-ohi.net/english/standards-publications/introduction.html |archivedate=24 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }} | IHO Catalogue of Publications&lt;/ref&gt; followed by its Member States as well as Memoranda of Understanding and Co-operative Agreements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/english/letters-and-documents/mou-agreements.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410145023/http://www.iho-ohi.net/english/letters-and-documents/mou-agreements.html |archivedate=10 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }} | IHO Memoranda of Understanding and Co-operative Agreements&lt;/ref&gt; with hydrographic survey interests.

The product of such hydrography is most often seen on nautical charts published by the national agencies and  required by the International Maritime Organization (IMO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imo.org/safety/mainframe.asp?topic_id=350 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415030816/http://www.imo.org/Safety/mainframe.asp?topic_id=350 |archivedate=15 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }} | IMO&lt;/ref&gt; the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icomia.com/technical-info/docs/SOLASV.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206011442/http://icomia.com/technical-info/docs/SOLASV.pdf |archivedate=6 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }} | SOLAS CHAPTER V SAFETY OF NAVIGATION&lt;/ref&gt; and national regulations to be carried on vessels for safety purposes. Increasingly those charts are provided and used in electronic form unders IHO standards.

===Hydrographic survey conducted by non-national agencies===
Governmental entities below the national level conduct or contract for hydrographic surveys for waters within their jurisdictions with both internal and contract assets. Such surveys commonly are conducted by national [[hydrographic office|organizations]] or under their supervision or the standards they have approved, particularly when the use is for the purposes of chart making and distribution or the [[dredging]] of state-controlled waters.

In the United States, there is coordination with the National Hydrography Dataset in survey collection and publication.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/maps/gis/datahydro.html | Wisconsin DNR - Surface Water (Hydrography) Data - Conversion from Coverage to Geodatabase&lt;/ref&gt; State environmental organizations publish hydrographic data relating to their mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/implementation/water/tmdl/hydromaps.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125231253/http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/implementation/water/tmdl/hydromaps.html |archivedate=25 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }} | Texas Commission on Environmental Quality - Hydrography Maps and Data&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydrographic survey by private organizations ===
Commercial entities also conduct large-scale hydrographic and [[Geophysics|geophysical]] surveying, particularly in the dredging, marine construction, [[oil exploration]], and drilling industries. Industrial entities installing submarine communications cables&lt;ref&gt;http://www.setech-uk.com/pdf/Paper2.pdf HYDROGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND THE SUBMARINE CABLE INDUSTRY&lt;/ref&gt; or power&lt;ref&gt;http://sanpedrosun.net/old/belcable.html | BEL submarine cable survey complete&lt;/ref&gt; require detailed surveys of cable routes prior to installation and increasingly use acoustic imagery equipment previously found only in military applications when conducting their surveys.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hydro-international.com/news/id2826-Utec_Surveyor_Equipped_for_Deep_Ocean_Cable_Route_Surveys.html | Utec Surveyor Equipped for Deep Ocean Cable Route Surveys&lt;/ref&gt; Specialized companies exist that haveboth the equipment and expertise to contract with both commercial and governmental entities to perform such surveys .

Companies, universities, and investment groups will often fund hydrographic surveys of public waterways prior to developing areas adjacent those waterways. Survey firms are also contracted to survey in support of design and engineering firms that are under contract for large public projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hydro-international.com/news/id3583-Infrastructure_Survey_in_Turkey.html | Infrastructure Survey in Turkey 14 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Private surveys are also conducted before dredging operations and after these operations are completed.  Companies with large private slips, docks, or other waterfront installations have their facilities and the open water near their facilities surveyed regularly, as do islands in areas subject to variable erosion such as in the Maldives.

== Hydrographic survey by crowdsourcing ==
[[Crowdsourcing]] also is entering hydrographic surveying, with projects such as [[OpenSeaMap]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openseamap.org/fileadmin/user_upload/inhalt/PDF/Artikel_Hydro_International-2013-02.pdf|title=Hydro International: Water Depths by Crowdsourcing|author=|date=|website=openseamap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.teamsurv.eu TeamSurv] and ARGUS. Here, volunteer vessels record position, depth, and time data using their standard navigation instruments, and then the data is post-processed to account for speed of sound, tidal, and other corrections. With this approach there is no need for a specific survey vessel, or for professionally qualified surveyors to be on board, as the expertise is in the data processing that occurs once the data is uploaded to the server after the voyage. Apart from obvious cost savings, this also gives a continuous survey of an area, but the drawbacks are time in recruiting observers and getting a high enough density and quality of data. Although sometimes accurate to 0.1 - 0.2m, this approach cannot substitute for a rigorous systematic survey, where this is required.  Nevertheless, the results are often more than adequate for many requirements where high resolution, high accuracy surveys are not required or are unaffordable.

==Methods==

===Lead lines, sounding poles, and single-beam echosounders===

The history of hydrographic surveying dates almost as far back as that of [[sailing]].&lt;ref name="noaahistorysurvey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/hsd/hydro_history.html|title=Page Not Found - Office of Coast Survey|author=|date=|website=www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many centuries, a hydrographic survey required the use of lead lines &amp;ndash; ropes or lines with depth markings attached to lead weights to make one end sink to the bottom when lowered over the side of a ship or boat &amp;ndash; and sounding poles, which were poles with depth markings which could be thrust over the side until they touched bottom. In either case, the depths measured had to be read manually and recorded, as did the position of each measurement with regard to mapped reference points as determined by three-point [[sextant]] fixes. The process was labor-intensive and time-consuming and, although each individual depth measurement could be accurate, even a thorough survey as a practical matter could include only a limited number of sounding measurements relative to the area being surveyed, inevitably leaving gaps in coverage between single soundings.&lt;ref name="noaahistorysurvey"/&gt;

Single-beam [[echosounder]]s and fathometers began to enter service in the 1930s which used [[sonar]] to measure the depth beneath a vessel. This greatly increased the speed of acquiring sounding data over that possible with lead lines and sounding poles by allowing information on depths beneath a vessel to be gathered in a series of lines spaced at a specified distance. However, it shared the weakness of earlier methods by lacking depth information for areas in between the strips of sea bottom the vessel sounded.&lt;ref name="noaahistorysurvey"/&gt;

===Wire-drag surveying===

[[File:Wire drag operations.jpg|300px|left|thumb|A [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey|U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]] diagram of wire-drag hydrographic survey operations, ca. 1920. The basic principle is to drag a wire attached to two vessels at a set depth; if the wire encounters an obstruction it will come taut and form a "V," indicating the location of an obstruction at that depth.]]In 1904, wire-drag surveys were introduced into hydrography, and the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]]′s [[Nicholas H. Heck]] played a prominent role in developing and perfecting the technique between 1906 and 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/cgsbios/bioh14.html|title=NOAA History - Profiles in Time/C&amp;GS Biographies - Captain Nicholas H. Heck|author=|date=|website=www.history.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wire-drag method, a wire attached to two ships or boats and set at a certain depth by a system of weights and buoys was dragged between two points. If the wire encountered an obstruction, it would become taut and form a "V" shape. The location of the "V" revealed the position of submerged rocks, wrecks, and other obstructions, while the depth at which the wire was set showed the depth at which the obstruction was encountered.&lt;ref name="noaahistorysurvey"/&gt; This method revolutionized hydrographic surveying, as it allowed a quicker, less laborious, and  far more complete survey of an area than did the use of lead lines and sounding poles.

Prior to the advent of [[sidescan sonar]], wire-drag surveying was the only method for searching large areas for obstructions and lost vessels and aircraft.&lt;ref name="heck"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/ships/heck.html|title=NOAA History -  Tools of the Trade/Ships/C&amp;GS Ships/HECK|author=|date=|website=www.history.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1906 and 1916, Heck expanded the capability of wire-drag systems from a relatively limited area to sweeps covering channels two to three [[nautical mile]]s (3.7 to 5.6 km) in width.&lt;ref name=NOAA200WireDrag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/breakthroughs/hydro_survey/welcome.html#techni|title=Breakthrough article on Hydrographic Survey Techniques|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|last=Administration|date=|website=celebrating200years.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wire-drag technique was a major contribution to hydrographic surveying during much of the rest of the 20th century. So valuable was wire-drag surveying in the United States that for decades the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, and later the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, fielded a pair of [[sister ship]]s of identical design specifically to work together on such surveys. [[USC&amp;GS Marindin|USC&amp;GS ''Marindin'']] and [[USC&amp;GS Ogden|USC&amp;GS ''Ogden'']] conducted wire-drag surveys together from 1919 to 1942, [[USC&amp;GS Hilgard (ASV 82)|USC&amp;GS ''Hilgard'' (ASV 82)]] and [[USC&amp;GS Wainwright (ASV 83)|USC&amp;GS ''Wainwright'' (ASV 83)]] took over from 1942 to 1967, and USC&amp;GS ''Rude'' (ASV 90) (later [[NOAAS Rude (S 590)|NOAAS ''Rude'' (S 590)]]) and USC&amp;GS ''Heck'' (ASV 91) (later [[NOAAS Heck (S 591)|NOAAS ''Heck'' (S 591)]]) worked together on wire-drag operations from 1967.&lt;ref name="noaahistorysurvey"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/ships/marindin.html|title=NOAA History -  Tools of the Trade/Ships/C&amp;GS Ships/MARINDIN|author=|date=|website=www.history.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/ships/ogden.html|title=NOAA History -  Tools of the Trade/Ships/C&amp;GS Ships/OGDEN|author=|date=|website=www.history.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/ships/hilgard.html|title=NOAA History -  Tools of the Trade/Ships/C&amp;GS Ships/HILGARD|author=|date=|website=www.history.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rude"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/ships/rude.html|title=NOAA History -  Tools of the Trade/Ships/C&amp;GS Ships/RUDE|author=|date=|website=www.history.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heck"/&gt;

The rise of new electronic technologies &amp;ndash; sidescan sonar and multibeam swath systems &amp;ndash; in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s eventually made the wire-drag system obsolete. Sidescan sonar could create images of underwater obstructions with the same fidelity as [[aerial photography]], while multibeam systems could generate depth data for 100 percent of the bottom in a surveyed area. These technologies allowed a single vessel to do what wire-drag surveying required two vessels to do, and wire-drag surveys finally came to an end in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="noaahistorysurvey"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NOAA200WireDrag/&gt; Vessels were freed from working together on wire-drag surveys, and in the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), for example, ''Rude'' and ''Heck'' operated independently in their later years.&lt;ref name="rude"/&gt;&lt;ref name="heck"/&gt;

===Modern surveying===
[[File:Sonar operations by survey ship.jpg|thumb|Graphic depicting NOAA hydrographic survey ship conducting multibeam and side scan sonar operations]]

At one time different data collection methods and standards were used in collecting hydrographic data for maritime safety and for scientific or engineering [[bathymetric]] charts, but increasingly, with the aid of improved collection techniques and computer processing, the data is collected under one standard and extracted for specific use.

After data is collected, it has to undergo post-processing.  A massive amount of data is collected during the typical hydrographic survey, often several soundings per [[square foot]]. Depending on the final use intended for the data (for example, [[navigation chart]]s, [[Digital Terrain Model]], volume calculation for [[dredging]], [[topography]], or [[bathymetry]]) this data must be thinned out. It must also be corrected for errors (i.e., bad soundings,) and for the effects of [[tides]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070325091416/http://www.thsoa.org/hy03/3a_3.pdf waves]/[https://web.archive.org/web/20070614123051/http://chl.erdc.usace.army.mil/library/publications/chetn/pdf/cetn-vi-17.pdf heave], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070324014031/http://www.hydrographicsociety.org/Articles/journal/2002/104-3.htm water level] and [[thermocline]]s (water temperature differences). Usually the surveyor has additional data collection equipment on site to record the data required for correcting the soundings. The final output of charts can be created with a combination of specialty charting software or a [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) package, usually [[Autocad]].

Although the accuracy of crowd-sourced surveying can rarely reach the standards of traditional methods, the [[algorithm]]s used rely on a high data density to produce final results that are more accurate than single measurements. A comparison of crowd-sourced surveys with multibeam surveys indicates an accuracy of crowd-sourced surveys of around plus or minus 0.1 to 0.2 meter (about 4 to 8 inches).

'''ISO 3166-2:CF''' is the entry for the [[Central African Republic]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for the Central African Republic, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[prefectures of the Central African Republic|1 commune, 14 prefectures, and 2 economic prefectures]]. The commune [[Bangui]] is the capital of the country and has special status equal to the prefectures and economic prefectures.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|CF}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of the Central African Republic. The second part is either of the following:
* two letters: prefectures and economic prefectures
* three letters: commune

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

[[ISO 639-1]] codes are used to represent subdivision names in the following [[official language|administrative language]]s:
* (fr): [[French language|French]]
* (sg): [[Sango language|Sango]]

[[File:Pescone alla foce.jpg|thumb|Torrente Pescone, one of the inflows of [[Lake Orta]] ([[Italy]]).]]
In [[hydrology]], the '''inflow''' of a [[body of water]] is the source of the [[water]] in the body of water. It can also refer to the average [[volume]] of incoming water in unit [[time]]. It is contrasted with [[outflow (hydrology)|outflow]].

==Overview==
All bodies of water have multiple inflows, but often, one inflow may predominate and be the largest source of water. However, in many cases, no single inflow will predominate and there will be multiple primary inflows. For a [[lake]], the inflow may be a [[river]] or [[stream]] that literally flows into the lake. Inflow may also be, strictly speaking, not flows, but rather [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], like [[rain]]. 

Inflow can also be used to refer to [[groundwater recharge]].

[[File:Antarctica-east2-en.jpg|thumb|(Kaiser) Wilhelm II Land]]

'''Kaiser Wilhelm II Land''' (also '''Wilhelm II Coast''') is the part of [[Antarctica]] lying between [[Cape Penck]], at 87°43'E, and [[Cape Filchner]], at 91°54'E and is claimed as part of the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]], although this claim is not universally recognized.

The area was discovered on February 22, 1902 during the [[Gauss expedition]] (1901-1903), led by Arctic veteran and geology professor [[Erich von Drygalski]]. Drygalski named it after [[William II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]]&lt;ref name=gnis/&gt; who had funded the expedition with 1.2 million [[German gold mark|Goldmark]]s.

In the bay where Drygalski's expedition had their camp until February 8, 1903 is [[Gaussberg]], a 370 metre high extinct [[volcano]] which was named after the mathematician and physicist [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].

The '''Kurmangazy oil field''' is an offshore oil field located in the Kazakh section of the [[Caspian Sea]] on the maritime border between [[Russia]] and [[Kazakhstan]], about {{convert|120|km|mi|-1}} west of the [[Buzachi Peninsula]]. It is expected to be the third largest oil field of Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name=silkroad&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The field is named after [[Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly]].

==History==
The first agreement concerning Kurmangazy field was signed in 2002. The US$23&amp;nbsp;billion worth PSA agreement was signed with [[KazMunayGas]] and [[Rosneft]] on 6 June 2005.&lt;ref name=silkroad/&gt;  In May 2006, the first well was drilled into the structure; however, it failed to strike oil.&lt;ref name=silkroad/&gt;

==Reserves==
The oil field has estimated reserves of {{convert|7|to|10|Goilbbl|e9m3|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name=silkroad/&gt;

==Operator==
The field is operated by Kurmangazy Petroleum Company. KazMunayTeniz, a subsidiary of KazMunayGas, owns 50% of the project and RN – Kazakhstan LLС, a subsidiary of Rosneft, owns 25%.&lt;ref name=silkroad/&gt;  Originally, 25% of shares was assigned to [[Zarubezhneft]], but later Rosneft received  the option on this remaining stake once commercial extraction commences.&lt;ref name=silkroad/&gt;&lt;ref name=alex1&gt;

The staff want to get her back on the floor at all costs, especially when they discover she is to be replaced with the more-than-annoying Miss Featherstone. Fortunately, Mr. Humphries comes to the rescue as only he can, dressing up as an annoying female customer, prompting Miss Featherstone to leave. Mrs. Slocombe is reinstated but new regulations force Captain Peacock and Mr. Rumbold into lower positions.

Most state flags were designed and adopted after independence in 1948.

[[File:Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax -standing-8.jpg|right|thumb|Red-billed chough]]
[[File:Puffinus puffinus -Iceland -flying-6.jpg|right|thumb|Manx shearwater]]
Over 300 [[species]] of [[bird]] have been recorded in the wild on the [[Isle of Man]], a self-governing island in the [[Irish Sea]] between [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. Over 100 species breed there, including significant populations of [[red-billed chough]], [[peregrine falcon]] and [[hen harrier]].&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, Mark. ''[http://www.fatbirder.com/links_geo/europe/england_isle_of_man.html Isle of Man]'', fatbirder.com. Accessed 7 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of [[seabird]]s breed on the coastal cliffs such as [[Atlantic puffin]], [[black guillemot]], [[black-legged kittiwake]], [[European shag]] and [[northern fulmar]].&lt;ref name=Garrad&gt;Garrad, Larch S. (1972) ''The Naturalist in the Isle of Man'', David &amp; Charles, Newton Abbot.&lt;/ref&gt; The island gives its name to the [[Manx shearwater]] which formerly nested in large numbers on the [[Calf of Man]]. The colony disappeared following the arrival of rats but the shearwaters began to return in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Garrad/&gt; [[Point of Ayre|The Ayres]] in the north of the island have colonies of [[little tern]], [[Arctic tern]] and [[common tern]].&lt;ref name=Garrad/&gt;

Moorland areas on the island are home to [[red grouse]], [[Eurasian curlew]] and [[northern raven]].&lt;ref name=Garrad/&gt; Woodland birds include [[long-eared owl]], [[common treecreeper]], [[Eurasian blackcap]] and [[common chiffchaff]]. There is little native woodland on the island and several species found in Great Britain, such as [[tawny owl]], [[Eurasian green woodpecker]] and [[Eurasian jay]], do not breed on the isle of Man.

Many birds visit the island during the winter and migration seasons including [[wader]]s such as [[purple sandpiper]], [[turnstone]] and [[European golden plover|golden plover]].&lt;ref name=Garrad/&gt; Wintering [[wildfowl]] include small numbers of [[whooper swan]]. A [[bird observatory]] was established on the [[Calf of Man]] in 1959 to study the migrating and breeding birds. By the end of 2001, 99,042 birds of 134 species had been [[bird ringing|ringed]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Manx National Heritage (2012) ''[http://www.gov.im/mnh/heritage/countryside/sound/observatory.xml The Work of the Observatory]''. Accessed 7 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous rarities have been recorded there including [[American mourning dove]] and [[white-throated robin]].

The list below includes 323 species of bird. The English names are those recommended by the [[International Ornithological Congress]] (IOC) with alternative names given in brackets.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, F. &amp; D. Donsker, ''eds.'' (2012) ''[http://www.worldbirdnames.org IOC World Bird Names (v 3.1)]''. Accessed 7 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific names and classification follow the [[British Ornithologists' Union]] (BOU).&lt;ref&gt;BOU (2011) ''[http://www.bou.org.uk//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/British-List-2011.pdf The British List]''. Accessed 7 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Species marked as rare are those for which the Manx Ornithological Society (MOS) requires a written description in order to accept a record.&lt;ref&gt;Manx Birdlife (2009) ''[http://manxbirdlife.im/the-isle-of-man/the-manx-bird-list-2008/the-manx-list-2008-categories-a-b-and-c/ The Manx List 2009 - Categories A, B and C]''. Accessed 7 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manx Ornithological Society uses the following codes:&lt;ref&gt;Manx Birdlife (2009) ''[http://manxbirdlife.im/the-isle-of-man/the-manx-bird-list-2008/ The Manx Bird List - 2009]''. Accessed 7 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A: a species which has occurred naturally on the island since 1 January 1950
* B: a species which has occurred naturally but only before 31 December 1949
* C: a species with an established breeding population as a result of introduction by man
* C*: a species which has visited the island from an introduced population in Great Britain

Failed introductions such as [[black grouse]] or species which are not yet established such as [[red-winged laughingthrush]] are not included on the list.

=== Queensland ===
There is no legal nude beach in [[Queensland]].  This was restated in April 2016 following another petition to the Labor State Government who said they would not approve a nudist beach.  Police Minister Bill Byrne on May 2nd 2016 rejected two attempts - a paper petition with 527 signatures and an online petition bearing 946 names - to create a "clothing optional beach".  Petitioners wanted a beach "for the recreational use of those who wish to sunbathe or swim nude without the fear of prosecution".  Minister Byrne said the State's Public Safety Business Agency advised Queensland's wilful exposure laws were designed to protect citizens and keep them safe.. "As such, I can advise that the Queensland government has no plans to change the current legislation dealing with wilful exposure, therefore the designation of a clothing optional beach is not supported at this time."

Queensland is the only mainland state in Australia that has no legal nude beaches.

Current unofficial beaches are:
* Alexandria Bay (known as "A Bay") near [[Noosa, Queensland|Noosa]] is a popular spot with nudists and arguably the most tolerated nude beach.&lt;ref name="suns_Nudi"&gt;{{cite web

* Bribie Island - Remote beaches on Bribie were once popular with nudists, though [[Moreton Bay Region|Moreton Bay]] rangers as well as police now regularly patrol this remote island.
* Buchan beach, {{convert|27|km|mi}} north of [[Cairns]].{{efn|location of Buchan Beach {{coord|-16.735871| 145.662899|format=dms|display=inline}} }}

==New Zealand==
There is no law prohibiting nakedness in public. In cases of ‘public nakedness’ the police go to the Summary Offences Act 1981 and consider, S27 Obscene/Indecent exposure; S4 Offensive behaviour; or S4 Disorderly behaviour.
In 1991 an appeal to the High Court won and determined that the legal definition of 'offensive' was not met by mere nakedness, even in the presence of  children, in a place where nudity was 'not uncommon' or 'known to occur'.  There had to be 'intent to offend'.  Public nudity on beaches is generally not enforceable. There have been a number of successful legal challenges to being naked in a public area, including cycling and running, so long as there was no intent to offend.

'''Marble''' is a [[virtual globe]] application which allows the user to choose among the Earth, the Moon, Venus, Mars and other planets to display as a 3-D model. It is [[free software]] under the terms of the [[GNU LGPL]], developed by [[KDE]] for use on [[personal computer]]s and [[smart phone]]s.&lt;ref name="Marble Touch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nienhueser.de/blog/?p=352 |title=Introducing Marble Touch |last=Nienhüser |first=Dennis |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129025522/http://nienhueser.de/blog/?p=352 |archivedate=2011-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is written in C++ and uses [[Qt (software)|Qt]].

Marble is intended to be very flexible; beyond its cross-platform design, the core components can easily be integrated into other programs. It is designed to run without the need for hardware acceleration, but it can be extended to use [[OpenGL]]. An important user-experience objective being that the application start fairly quickly, it ships with a minimal but useful off-line dataset (5–10MB{{Citation needed|reasom=Seems to be more than 20 MB|date=December 2013}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.kde.org/development/en/kdeedu/marble/introduction.html|title=Chapter 1.

'''North Tyrol''', or '''North Tirol''' is the main part of the [[Austria]]n [[States of Austria|state]] of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], located in the western part of the country. The other part of the state is [[East Tyrol]], which also belongs to Austria, but does not share a border with North Tyrol.

Besides those two regions, the historical region of [[Tyrol (region)|Tyrol]] for many centuries also included the [[South Tyrol]] and the historical region of [[Trentino|Welschtirol]], which were annexed by [[Italy]] after [[World War I]]. With that, North Tyrol and East Tyrol were effectively cut off from each other. In the aftermath of World War I, there was a serious movement to unify North Tyrol with Bavaria.&lt;ref name="carsten3"&gt;Carsten, Francis Ludwig. ''The First Austrian Republic: 1918-1938''. Gower, 1986. P. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

North Tyrol borders [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] in the east, the [[Germany|German]] [[States of Germany|federal state]] of [[Bavaria]] in the north, [[Vorarlberg]] to the west, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Graubünden]] (Grison) to the southwest, and [[South Tyrol]] in [[Italy]] to the south. The provincial capital is [[Innsbruck]].

'''Old Harry Rocks''' are three [[chalk]] formations, including a [[Stack (geology)|stack]] and a stump, located at Handfast Point, on the [[Isle of Purbeck]] in [[Dorset]], southern [[England]]. They mark the most easterly point of the [[Jurassic Coast]], a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]].

== Location ==
Old Harry Rocks lies directly east of [[Studland]], about {{convert|1.5|mi}} northeast of [[Swanage]], and about {{convert|3|mi}} south of the large towns of [[Poole]] and [[Bournemouth]]. To the south are the chalk cliffs of [[Ballard Down]], much of which is owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. The rocks can be viewed from the Dorset section of the [[South West Coast Path#Dorset|South West Coast Path]]

== Formation ==
The chalk of Old Harry Rocks used to be part of a long stretch of chalk between Purbeck and the Isle of Wight, but remained as a headland after large parts of this seam were eroded away. As the headland suffered hydraulic action (a process in which air and water are forced into small cracks by the force of the sea, resulting in enlarging cracks), first  caves, then arches formed. The tops of the arches collapsed after being weakened by rainfall and wind, leaving disconnected stacks. One of these stacks is known as Old Harry. Old Harry's Wife was another stack which was eroded through corrosion and abrasion, until the bottom was so weak the top fell away, leaving a stump. Hydraulic action is the main cause of erosion (sheer force of the wave) that damaged the rock and caused it to fall away.

== Geology ==
The [[downland]]s of Ballard Down are formed of chalk with some bands of [[flint]], and were formed approximately 66 million years ago. The bands of stone have been gradually eroded over the centuries, some of the earlier stacks having fallen (Old Harry's original wife fell in 1509), while new ones have been formed by the breaching of narrow isthmuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/Harry-Rocks.htm |title=Geology of Harry Rock sand Ballard Point |accessdate=2007-12-21 |work=Geology of the Wessex Coast of Southern England }}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the water to the east [[The Needles]] on the Isle of Wight are usually visible.  These are also part of the same chalk band and only a few thousand years ago were connected to [[Ballard Down]].

To form the stacks, the sea gradually eroded along the joints and bedding planes where the softer chalk meets harder bedrock of the rock formations to create a cave. This eventually [[erosion|eroded]] right through to create an arch. The arch subsequently collapsed to leave the stacks of Old Harry and his wife, No Man's Land and the gap of St Lucas' Leap. The large outcrop of rock at the end of the cliffs is often referred to as "No Man's Land".

Old Harry is formed by erosion processes, which will eventually remove the stack, whilst new stacks develop. Some people desire to preserve the rocks and protect them from the erosive processes that formed Old Harry.  The [[National Trust]], who own the stacks in perpetuity, have experience in looking after the coast, and have found that "working with natural processes is the most sustainable approach".&lt;ref&gt;Shifting Shores. Living with a changing coastline (National Trust)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legend ==
There are various stories about the naming of the rocks. One legend says that the [[Devil]] (traditionally known euphemistically as "Old Harry") slept on the rocks. Another local legend says that the rocks were named after [[Harry Paye]], the infamous Poole [[pirate]], whose ship hid behind the rocks awaiting passing merchantmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/purbeck-countryside/features/old-harry---purbeck-landmark|title=Old Harry - Purbeck landmark|publisher=[[National Trust]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Yet another tale has it that a ninth-century Viking raid was thwarted by a storm and that one of the drowned, Earl Harold, was turned into a pillar of chalk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EtrsAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT44|page=44|year=2014|title=The Coastal Headlands of Mainland Britain: A practical guide and much more...|author=Fellows, Griff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Mozambique:

'''[[Mozambique]]''' &amp;ndash; [[List of sovereign states|sovereign country]] located in southeastern [[Africa]] bordered by the [[Indian Ocean]] to the east, [[Tanzania]] to the north, [[Malawi]] and [[Zambia]] to the northwest, [[Zimbabwe]] to the west and [[Swaziland]] and South Africa to the southwest.&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=3 July 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mz.html|title=Mozambique|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mozambique was explored by [[Vasco da Gama]] in 1498 and colonized by [[Portugal]] in 1505. By 1510, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] had control of all of the former Arab sultanates on the east African coast. From about 1500, [[Portugal|Portuguese]] trading posts and forts became regular ports of call on the new route to the east.

It is a member of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Mozambique (Moçambique) was named after ''Muça Alebique'', a sultan.

[[File:Pic 367 nessuit.JPG|thumb|Ogiek Peoples visualising their traditional spatial knowledge on a 1:10,000 scale participatory 3D model, Nessuit, Mau Forest Complex, Kenya]]
'''Participatory 3D modelling''' ('''P3DM''') is a community-based [[cartography|mapping]] method which integrates local spatial knowledge with data on elevation of the land and depth of the sea to produce stand-alone, scaled and [[geo-referenced]] [[relief model]]s. Essentially based on local spatial knowledge, land use and cover, and other features are depicted by informants on the model by the use of pushpins (points), yarns (lines) and paints (polygons). On completion, a scaled and geo-referenced grid is applied to facilitate data extraction or importation. Data depicted on the model are extracted, digitised and plotted. On completion of the exercise the model remains with the community.&lt;ref&gt;Rambaldi G. and Callosa-Tarr J. 2002.

'''Pepper Coast''' was the name given by European traders to a coastal area of western [[Africa]], between [[Cape Mesurado]] and [[Cape Palmas]]. It encloses the present republic of [[Liberia]]. It got its name from the [[grain of paradise|melegueta pepper]]. The pepper is also known as the ''grain of paradise'', which gave rise to an alternative name, the '''Grain Coast'''. The importance of the spice is shown by the designation of the area from the [[Saint John River (Liberia)|Saint John River]] (at present-day [[Buchanan, Liberia|Buchanan]]) to Harper in Liberia as the "Grain Coast" in reference to the availability of grains of paradise.&lt;ref name="Laurie"&gt;''Laurie's Sailing Directory for the Ethiopic or Southern Atlantic Ocean to the Rio de la Plata, Cape Horn, and the Cape of Good Hope etc., including the Islands between the two coasts''; 4th Edition 1855&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases (as shown on the map) this term covers a wider area incorporating [[Sierra Leone]] and the [[Ivory Coast]].

==A brief history==
Red Star's European story began in 1956 in [[Kerkrade]], Netherlands. The first rival in the first round of the [[1956–57 European Cup]] were Dutch champions [[Roda JC Kerkrade|Rapid JC]] (the club later change its name to Roda JC), with [[Bora Kostić]] scoring Red Star's first ever European goal. Since the first [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] semi-final, when Red Star was eliminated by [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], Red Star participated 14 times in a European competition quarter-final (not counting the [[Mitropa Cup]]), and was a semi-finalist in each of the three cup competitions for a total of six appearances. Throughout this time, Red Star steadily kept its place among the top 15 European clubs on [[UEFA]]'s ranking list, situated just behind [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] for the number of participations in European Cups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crvenazvezdafk.com/en/istorija2.htm crvenazvezdafk.com - Autumn]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Red Star were finally ready for Europe and the road to [[Bari]], where the final of the [[1991 European Cup Final|1991 European Cup]] was played.

From 1992 to 1995, the clubs from FR Yugoslavia were forbidden to take part in the European competitions, due to the [[sanctions against Yugoslavia]]. Red Star has never managed to regain its previous reputation afterwards, participating in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League]] group stage for three times since 1995 and qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage one time [[2018–19 UEFA Champions League|2018–19]].

[[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] '''Robert Falcon Scott''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|sep=,|CVO|RN}} (6 June 1868&amp;nbsp;– 29 March 1912) was a British [[Royal Navy]] officer and explorer who led two expeditions to the [[Antarctic]] regions: the [[Discovery Expedition|''Discovery'' Expedition]] of 1901–1904 and the ill-fated [[Terra Nova Expedition|''Terra Nova'' Expedition]] of 1910–1913. On the first expedition, he set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82°S and discovered the [[Antarctic Plateau]], on which the South Pole is located. On the second venture, Scott led a party of five which reached the [[South Pole]] on 17 January 1912, less than five weeks after [[Roald Amundsen]]'s [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|Norwegian expedition]]. On their return journey, Scott's party discovered plant [[fossil]]s, proving Antarctica was once forested and joined to other continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15384729 |title=Four things Captain Scott found in Antarctica|publisher= BBC|accessdate= 11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A planned meeting with supporting dog teams from the base camp failed, despite Scott's written instructions, and at a distance of 150 miles from their base camp and 11 miles from the next depot, Scott and his companions died.

Before his appointment to lead the ''Discovery'' Expedition, Scott had followed the career of a naval officer in the Royal Navy. In 1899, he had a chance encounter with Sir [[Clements Markham]], the president of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], and thus learned of a planned Antarctic expedition, which he soon volunteered to lead.{{sfn|Crane|p=82}} Having taken this step, his name became inseparably associated with the Antarctic, the field of work to which he remained committed during the final 12 years of his life.

Following the news of his death, Scott became a celebrated hero, a status reflected by memorials erected across the UK. However, in the last decades of the 20th century, questions were raised about his competence and character. Commentators in the 21st century have regarded Scott more positively after assessing the temperature drop below {{convert|-40|C|F}} in March 1912 and after re-discovering Scott's written orders of October 1911, in which he had instructed the dog teams to meet and assist him on the return trip.{{sfn|May|2013}}

== Early life ==

=== Family ===
[[File:Robert Falcon Scott aged 13.jpg|thumb|upright|Scott, aged 13]]
Scott was born on 6 June 1868, the third of six children and elder son of John Edward, a brewer and magistrate, and Hannah (née Cuming) Scott of [[Stoke Damerel]], near [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]]. There were also naval and military traditions in the family, Scott's grandfather and four uncles all having served in the army or navy.{{sfn|Crane|pp=14–15}} John Scott's prosperity came from the ownership of a small [[Plymouth]] brewery which he had inherited from his father and subsequently sold.{{sfn|Crane|p=22}} Scott's early childhood years were spent in comfort, but some years later, when he was establishing his naval career, the family  suffered serious financial misfortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/race-to-the-end-of-the-earth/scott-s-expedition |title=Scott's Expedition|website= American Museum of Natural History|accessdate= 15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the family's tradition, Scott and his younger brother Archie were predestined for careers in the armed services. Scott spent four years at a local day school before being sent to [[Stubbington House School]] in Hampshire, a [[cram school|cramming establishment]] that prepared candidates for the entrance examinations to the naval training ship [[HMS Prince of Wales (1860)|HMS ''Britannia'']] at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]]. Having passed these exams Scott began his naval career in 1881, as a 13-year-old cadet.{{sfn|Fiennes|p=17}}

=== Early naval career ===
[[File:Robert Falcon Scott c1900.jpg|thumb|upright|Scott as a young man]]
In July 1883, Scott passed out of ''Britannia'' as a [[midshipman]], seventh overall in a class of 26.{{sfn|Crane|p=23}} By October, he was en route to South Africa to join {{HMS|Boadicea|1875|6}}, the flagship of the Cape squadron, the first of several ships on which he served during his midshipman years. While stationed in [[St Kitts]], [[West Indies]], on {{HMS|Rover|1874|6}}, he had his first encounter with [[Clements Markham]], then Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, who would loom large in Scott's later career. On this occasion, 1 March 1887, Markham observed Midshipman Scott's cutter winning that morning's race across the bay. Markham's habit was to "collect" likely young naval officers with a view to their undertaking polar exploration work in the future. He was impressed by Scott's intelligence, enthusiasm and charm, and the 18-year-old midshipman was duly noted.{{sfn|Crane|p=82}}

In March 1888 Scott passed his examinations for [[sub-lieutenant]], with four first class certificates out of five.{{sfn|Crane|p=34}} His career progressed smoothly, with service on various ships and promotion to lieutenant in 1889. In 1891, after a long spell in foreign waters, he applied for the two-year torpedo training course on {{HMS|Vernon|shore establishment|6}}, an important career step. He graduated with first class certificates in both the theory and practical examinations. A small blot occurred in the summer of 1893 when, while commanding a torpedo boat, Scott ran it aground, a mishap which earned him a mild rebuke.{{sfn|Crane|p=50}}

During the research for his dual biography of Scott and Roald Amundsen,&lt;ref&gt;''Scott and Amundsen'', later republished as ''The Last Place on Earth''. See [[#Sources|Sources]] section.&lt;/ref&gt; polar historian [[Roland Huntford]] investigated a possible scandal in Scott's early naval career, related to the period 1889–90 when Scott was a lieutenant on {{HMS|Amphion|1883|6}}. According to Huntford, Scott "disappears from naval records" for eight months, from mid-August 1889 until 26 March 1890. Huntford hints at involvement with a married American woman, a cover-up, and protection by senior officers. Biographer David Crane reduces the missing period to eleven weeks, but is unable to clarify further. He rejects the notion of protection by senior officers on the grounds that Scott was not important or well-connected enough to warrant this. Documents that may have offered explanations are missing from Admiralty records.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huntford, ''The Last Place on Earth''|pp=121–123}}, and {{harvnb|Crane|pp=39–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, while serving as torpedo officer on the depot ship {{HMS|Vulcan|1889|6}}, Scott learned of the financial calamity that had overtaken his family. John Scott, having sold the brewery and invested the proceeds unwisely, had lost all his capital and was now virtually bankrupt.{{sfn|Fiennes|p=21}} At the age of 63, and in poor health, he was forced to take a job as a brewery manager and move his family to [[Shepton Mallet]], Somerset. Three years later, while Robert was serving with the [[English Channel|Channel]] squadron flagship {{HMS|Majestic|1895|6}}, John Scott died of heart disease, creating a fresh family crisis.{{sfn|Fiennes|p=22}} Hannah Scott and her two unmarried daughters now relied entirely on the service pay of Scott and the salary of younger brother Archie, who had left the army for a higher-paid post in the colonial service. Archie's own death in the autumn of 1898, after contracting [[typhoid fever]], meant that the whole financial responsibility for the family rested on Scott.{{sfn|Fiennes|p=23}}

Promotion, and the extra income this would bring, now became a matter of considerable concern to Scott.{{sfn|Crane|p=59}} In the Royal Navy however, opportunities for career advancement were both limited and keenly sought after by ambitious officers. Early in June 1899, while home on leave, he had a chance encounter in a London street with Clements Markham, who was now knighted and President of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), and learned for the first time of an impending Antarctic expedition with [[RSS Discovery|''Discovery'']], under the auspices of the RGS. It was the opportunity for early command and a chance to distinguish himself, rather than any predilection for polar exploration which motivated Scott, according to Crane.{{sfn|Crane|p=84}} What passed between them on this occasion is not recorded, but a few days later, on 11 June, Scott appeared at the Markham residence and volunteered to lead the expedition.{{sfn|Crane|p=82}}

== ''Discovery'' Expedition 1901–1904 ==

The British National Antarctic Expedition, later known as the ''Discovery'' Expedition, was a joint enterprise of the RGS and the [[Royal Society]]. A long-cherished dream of Markham's, it required all of his skills and cunning to bring the expedition to fruition, under naval command and largely staffed by naval personnel. Scott may not have been Markham's first choice as leader but, having decided on him, the older man's support remained constant.{{sfn|Crane|p=90}} There were committee battles over the scope of Scott's responsibilities, with the Royal Society pressing to put a scientist in charge of the expedition's programme while Scott merely commanded the ship. Eventually, however, Markham's view prevailed;{{sfn|Preston|pp=28–29}} Scott was given overall command, and was promoted to the rank of commander before [[RRS Discovery|''Discovery'']] sailed for the Antarctic on 6 August 1901.{{sfn|Crane|p=63}} [[King Edward VII]], who showed a keen interest in the expedition, visited the Discovery the day before the ship left British shores in August 1901,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Discovery – Inspection by the King and Queen |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=6 August 1901 |page_number=10 |issue=36526}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the visit appointed Scott a [[Royal Victorian Order|Member of the Royal Victorian Order]] (MVO), his personal gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27346 |date=16 August 1901 |page=5409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experience of Antarctic or Arctic waters was almost entirely lacking within the 50-strong party and there was very little special training in equipment or techniques before the ship set sail.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|loc=Vol I|p=170}}: "Our ignorance was deplorable."&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs were taken, as were skis, but the dogs succumbed to disease in the first season. Nevertheless, the dogs' performance impressed Scott, and, despite moral qualms, he implemented the principle of slaughtering dogs for dog-food to increase their range.&lt;ref&gt;"The dog-team is invested with a capacity of work which is beyond the emulation of party of men ... This method of using dogs is one which can only be adopted with reluctance. One cannot calmly contemplate the murder of animals which possess such intelligence and individuality"  RF Scott ''The Voyage of the Discovery'' Vol I, Smith Elder &amp; Co, London 1905, p465f&lt;/ref&gt; During an early attempt at ice travel, a blizzard trapped expedition members in their tent and their decision to leave it resulted in the death of George Vince, who slipped over a precipice on 11 March 1902.{{sfn|Scott|pp=211–227}}{{sfn|Crane|pp=161–167}}

The expedition had both scientific and exploration objectives; the latter included a long journey south, in the direction of the South Pole. This march, undertaken by Scott, [[Ernest Shackleton]] and [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward Wilson]], took them to a latitude of 82°&amp;nbsp;17′&amp;nbsp;S, about {{convert|530|mi|km|sigfig=2}} from the pole. A harrowing return journey brought about Shackleton's physical collapse and his early departure from the expedition.{{sfn|Preston|pp=60–67}} The second year showed improvements in technique and achievement, culminating in Scott's western journey which led to the discovery of the [[Polar Plateau]]. This has been described by one writer as "one of the great polar journeys".{{sfn|Crane|p=270}} The scientific results of the expedition included important biological, zoological and geological findings.{{sfn|Fiennes|p=148}} Some of the meteorological and magnetic readings, however, were later criticised as amateurish and inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huntford, ''The Last Place on Earth''|pp=229–230}}; {{harvnb|Crane|pp=392–393}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the expedition it took the combined efforts of two relief ships and the use of explosives to free ''Discovery'' from the ice.{{sfn|Preston|pp=78–79}} His insistence during the expedition on Royal Navy formalities had made for uneasy relations with the merchant navy contingent, many of whom departed for home with the first relief ship in March 1903. Second-in-command [[Albert Armitage]], a merchant officer, was offered the chance to go home on compassionate grounds, but interpreted the offer as a personal slight, and refused.{{sfn|Preston|pp=67–68}} Armitage also promoted the idea that the decision to send Shackleton home on the relief ship arose from Scott's animosity rather than Shackleton's physical breakdown.{{sfn|Crane|pp=240–241}} Although there was later tension between Scott and Shackleton, when their polar ambitions directly clashed, mutual civilities were preserved in public;{{sfn|Crane|p=310}} Scott joined in the official receptions that greeted Shackleton on his return in 1909 after the [[Nimrod Expedition]],{{sfn|Crane|pp=396–397}} and the two exchanged polite letters about their respective ambitions in 1909–10.{{sfn|Preston|p=113}}

=== Popular hero ===
''Discovery'' returned to Britain in September 1904. The expedition had caught the public imagination, and Scott became a popular hero. He was awarded a cluster of honours and medals, including many from overseas, and was promoted to the rank of [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captain]].{{sfn|Crane|p=309}} He was invited to [[Balmoral Castle]], where King [[Edward VII]] promoted him a [[Royal Victorian Order|Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] (CVO).{{sfn|Preston|pp=83–84}}

Scott's next few years were crowded. For more than a year he was occupied with public receptions, lectures and the writing of the expedition record, ''The Voyage of the Discovery''. In January 1906, he resumed his full-time naval career, first as an Assistant Director of [[Naval Intelligence]] at the [[Admiralty]] and, in August, as [[flag-captain]] to Rear-Admiral Sir George Egerton on {{HMS|Victorious|1895|6}}.{{sfn|Preston|p=86}} He was now moving in ever more exalted social circles&amp;nbsp;– a telegram to Markham in February 1907 refers to meetings with the [[Amélie of Orléans|Queen]] and [[Luis Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Crown Prince of Portugal]], and a later letter home reports lunching with the Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet and [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1862–1929)|Prince Heinrich of Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crane|p=334}}. The telegram related to a collision involving Scott's ship, {{HMS|Albemarle|1901|6}}. Scott was cleared of blame.&lt;/ref&gt; {{HMS|Albemarle|1901|6}}, a battleship commanded by Scott, collided with the battleship {{HMS|Commonwealth|1903|6}} on 11 February 1907, suffering minor bow damage.&lt;ref&gt;Burt 1988, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dispute with Shackleton ===
By early 1906, Scott had sounded out the RGS about the possible funding of a future Antarctic expedition.{{sfn|Preston|p=87}} It was therefore unwelcome news to him that [[Ernest Shackleton]] had announced his own plans to travel to ''Discovery''{{'}}s old [[McMurdo Sound]] base and launch a bid for the South Pole from there.&lt;ref&gt;Shackleton publicly announced his plans to the RGS on 7 February 1907. Scott had enjoined RGS Secretary Keltie to secrecy about his own intentions. {{harvnb|Crane|p=335}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott claimed, in the first of a series of letters to Shackleton, that the area around McMurdo was his own "field of work" to which he had prior rights until he chose to give them up, and that Shackleton should therefore work from an entirely different area.{{sfn|Crane|p=335}} In this, he was strongly supported by ''Discovery''{{'}}s former zoologist, [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward Wilson]], who asserted that Scott's rights extended to the entire [[Ross Sea]] sector.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=113–114}} This Shackleton refused to concede.

Finally, to end the impasse, Shackleton agreed, in a letter to Scott dated 17 May 1907, to work to the east of the 170°&amp;nbsp;W meridian and therefore to avoid all the familiar ''Discovery'' ground.{{sfn|Crane|pp=335, 341}} In the end it was a promise that he was unable to keep after his search for alternative landing grounds proved fruitless. With his only other option being to return home, he set up his headquarters at [[Cape Royds]], close to the old ''Discovery'' base.{{sfn|Barczewski|pp=52–53}} For this he was roundly condemned by the British polar establishment at the time.

Among modern polar writers, [[Ranulph Fiennes]] regards Shackleton's actions as a technical breach of honour, but adds: "My personal belief is that Shackleton was basically honest but circumstances forced his McMurdo landing, much to his distress." {{sfn|Fiennes|pp= 144–45}} The polar historian Beau Riffenburgh states that the promise to Scott "should never ethically have been demanded", and compares Scott's intransigence on this matter unfavourably with the generous attitudes of the Norwegian explorer [[Fridtjof Nansen]], who gave freely of his advice and expertise to all, whether they were potential rivals or not. {{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=118}}

=== Marriage ===
Scott, who because of his ''Discovery'' fame had entered [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] society, first met [[Kathleen Scott|Kathleen Bruce]] early in 1907 at a private luncheon party.{{sfn|Crane|p=344}} She was a sculptress, socialite and cosmopolitan who had studied under [[Auguste Rodin]]{{sfn|Preston|p=94}} and whose circle included [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Aleister Crowley]].{{sfn|Crane|p=350}} Her initial meeting with Scott was brief, but when they met again later that year, the mutual attraction was obvious. A stormy courtship followed; Scott was not her only suitor—his main rival was would-be novelist [[Gilbert Cannan]]—and his absences at sea did not assist his cause.{{sfn|Crane|pp=362–366}} However, Scott's persistence was rewarded and, on 2 September 1908, at the Chapel Royal, [[Hampton Court Palace]], the wedding took place.{{sfn|Crane|pp=373–374}} Their only child, [[Peter Scott|Peter Markham Scott]], born 14 September 1909,{{sfn|Crane|p=387}} was to found the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)]].

=== Preparation ===
Shackleton returned from the Antarctic having narrowly failed to reach the Pole, and this gave Scott the impetus to proceed with plans for his second Antarctic expedition.{{sfn|Preston|pp=100–101}} On 24 March 1909, he had taken the Admiralty-based appointment of naval assistant to the [[Second Sea Lord]] which placed him conveniently in London. In December he was released on half-pay, to take up the full-time command of the British Antarctic Expedition 1910, to be known as the [[Terra Nova Expedition]] from its ship, [[Terra Nova (ship)|''Terra Nova'']].{{sfn|Fiennes|p=161}}

It was the expressed hope of the RGS that this expedition would be "scientific primarily, with exploration and the Pole as secondary objects"{{sfn|Crane|pp=397–99}} but, unlike the [[Discovery Expedition|''Discovery'' Expedition]], neither they nor the Royal Society were in charge this time. In his expedition prospectus, Scott stated that its main objective was "to reach the South Pole, and to secure for the British Empire the honour of this achievement".{{sfn|Crane|pp=397–99}} Scott had, as Markham observed, been "bitten by the Pole mania".{{sfn|Crane|pp=397–99}}

In a memorandum of 1908, Scott presented his view that man-hauling to the South Pole was impossible and that motor traction was needed.&lt;ref&gt;RF Scott (1908) ''The Sledging Problem in the Antarctic, Men versus Motors''&lt;/ref&gt; Snow vehicles did not yet exist however, and so his engineer [[Reginald Skelton]] developed the idea of a caterpillar track for snow surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Huntford (2003) ''Scott and Amundsen. Their Race to the South Pole. The Last Place on Earth.'' Abacus, London, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of 1909 Scott realised that motors were unlikely to get him all the way to the Pole, and decided additionally to take horses (based on Shackleton's near success in attaining the Pole, using ponies),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Preston|p=107}}. Also {{harvnb|Crane|pp=432–433}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and dogs and skis after consultation with Nansen during trials of the motors in Norway in March 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Huntford (2003) ''Scott and Amundsen. Their Race to the South Pole. The Last Place on Earth.'' Abacus, London, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Man-hauling would still be needed on the Polar Plateau, on the assumption that motors and animals could not ascend the crevassed [[Beardmore Glacier]].&lt;ref&gt;The modern [[South Pole Traverse|South Pole Highway]] for tracked motors avoids the glacier.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dog expert [[Cecil Meares]] was going to [[Siberia]] to select the dogs, and Scott ordered that, while he was there, he should deal with the purchase of Manchurian ponies. Meares was not an experienced horse-dealer, and the ponies he chose proved mostly of poor quality, and ill-suited to prolonged Antarctic work.{{sfn|Preston|p=113}} Meanwhile, Scott also recruited Bernard Day, from Shackleton's expedition, as his motor expert.{{sfn|Preston|p=112}}

=== First season ===
[[File:Robert Falcon Scott in the Cape Evans hut, October 1911.jpg|thumb|alt=Man sitting cross-legged at table, pipe in hand, apparently writing. Much clutter of clothing, books and equipment is in the background.|Scott, writing his journal in the [[Cape Evans]] hut, winter 1911]]

On 15 June 1910, Scott's ship ''Terra Nova'', an old converted whaler, set sail from [[Cardiff]], South Wales. Scott meanwhile was fundraising in Britain and joined the ship later in South Africa. Arriving in [[Melbourne]], Australia in October 1910, Scott received a telegram from Amundsen stating: "Beg leave to inform you ''Fram'' proceeding Antarctic Amundsen", possibly indicating that Scott faced a race to the pole.{{sfn|Crane|pp=425–28}}

The expedition suffered a series of early misfortunes which hampered the first season's work and impaired preparations for the main polar march. On its journey from New Zealand to the Antarctic, ''Terra Nova'' nearly sank in a storm and was then trapped in [[pack ice]] for 20&amp;nbsp;days,{{sfn|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. I | pp=30–71}} far longer than other ships had experienced, which meant a late-season arrival and less time for preparatory work before the Antarctic winter. At Cape Evans, Antarctica, one of the motor sledges was lost during its unloading from the ship, breaking through the sea ice and sinking.{{sfn|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. I | pp=106–107}} Deteriorating weather conditions and weak, unacclimatised ponies affected the initial depot-laying journey, so that the expedition's main supply point, One Ton Depot, was laid {{convert|35|mi|km}} north of its planned location at 80°&amp;nbsp;S. [[Lawrence Oates]], in charge of the ponies, advised Scott to kill ponies for food and advance the depot to 80°&amp;nbsp;S, which Scott refused to do. Oates is reported as saying to Scott, "Sir, I'm afraid you'll come to regret not taking my advice."{{sfn|Crane|p=466}} Four ponies died during this journey either from the cold or because they slowed the team down and were shot.
[[File:TerraNova-Ponting.jpg|thumb|''Terra Nova'' held up in pack ice, 13 December 1910]]
On its return to base, the expedition learned of the presence of Amundsen, camped with his crew and a large contingent of dogs in the [[Bay of Whales]], 200&amp;nbsp;miles (320&amp;nbsp;km) to their east.{{sfn|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. I | pp=187–188}} Scott conceded that his ponies would not be able to start early enough in the season to compete with Amundsen's cold-tolerant dog teams for the pole, and also acknowledged that the Norwegian's base was closer to the pole by 60 miles.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's diary, 22 February 1911: "The proper, as well as wiser, course for us is to proceed exactly as though this had not happened. To go forward and do our best for the honour of the country without fear or panic. There is no doubt that Amundsen's plan is a serious menace to ours. He has a shorter distance to the Pole by 60 miles – I never thought he could have got so many dogs safely to the ice. His plan for running them seems excellent. But above all he can start his journey early in the season – an impossible condition with ponies."&lt;/ref&gt;
Wilson was more hopeful,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson's diary "As for Amundsen's prospects of reaching the Pole, I don't think they are very good...I don't think he knows how bad an effect the monotony and the hard travelling surface of the Barrier is to animals", cited from Ranulph Fiennes ''Captain Scott'' Hodder and Stoughton, London 2003 p219f&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Gran shared Scott's concern.&lt;ref&gt;Tryggve Gran's diary "If we reach the Pole, then Amundsen will reach the Pole, and weeks earlier. Our prospects are thus not exactly promising. The only thing that can save Scott is if an accident happens to Amundsen." cited from Ranulph Fiennes ''Captain Scott'' Hodder and Stoughton, London 2003 p219f&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, the death toll among the ponies increased to six, three drowning when sea-ice unexpectedly disintegrated, casting in doubt the possibility of reaching the pole at all. However, during the 1911 winter Scott's confidence increased; on 2 August, after the return of a three-man party from their winter journey to [[Cape Crozier]], Scott wrote, "I feel sure we are as near perfection as experience can direct".{{sfn|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. I | p=369}}

=== Journey to the Pole ===

Scott outlined his plans for the southern journey to the entire shore party,{{sfn|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. I | p=407}} leaving open who would form the final polar team, according to their performance during the polar travel. Eleven days before Scott's teams set off towards the pole, Scott gave the dog driver Meares the following written orders at Cape Evans dated 20 October 1911 to secure Scott's speedy return from the pole using dogs:

{{quote
| About the first week of February I should like you to start your third journey to the South, the object being to hasten the return of the third Southern unit [the polar party] and give it a chance to catch the ship. The date of your departure must depend on news received from returning units, the extent of the depot of dog food you have been able to leave at One Ton Camp, the state of the dogs, etc&amp;nbsp;... It looks at present as though you should aim at meeting the returning party about March 1 in Latitude 82 or 82.30{{sfn|Evans|1949|pp=187–188}}}}

The march south began on 1 November 1911, a caravan of mixed transport groups (motors, dogs, horses), with loaded sledges, travelling at different rates, all designed to support a final group of four men who would make a dash for the Pole. The southbound party steadily reduced in size as successive support teams turned back. Scott reminded the returning Surgeon-Lieutenant [[Edward L. Atkinson|Atkinson]] of the order "to take the two dog-teams south in the event of Meares having to return home, as seemed likely".{{sfn|Cherry-Garrard|pp=424}} By 4 January 1912, the last two four-man groups had reached 87°&amp;nbsp;34′&amp;nbsp;S.{{sfn|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. I | p=528}} Scott announced his decision: five men (Scott, [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward Wilson]], [[Henry Robertson Bowers|Henry Bowers]], [[Lawrence Oates]] and [[Edgar Evans]]) would go forward, the other three ([[Teddy Evans]], [[William Lashly]] and [[Tom Crean (explorer)|Tom Crean]]) would return. The chosen group marched on, reaching the Pole on 17 January 1912, only to find that Amundsen had preceded them by five weeks. Scott's anguish is indicated in his diary: "The worst has happened"; "All the day dreams must go"; "Great God! This is an awful place".{{sfn|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. I | pp=543–544}}

=== Last march ===
The deflated party began the {{convert|800|mi|km|adj=on}} return journey on 19 January. "I'm afraid the return journey is going to be dreadfully tiring and monotonous", wrote Scott on that day.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's diary, 19 January 1912&lt;/ref&gt; The party made good progress despite poor weather, and had completed the Polar Plateau stage of their journey, approximately 300&amp;nbsp;miles (500&amp;nbsp;km), by 7 February. In the following days, as the party made the {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} descent of the [[Beardmore Glacier]], the physical condition of Edgar Evans, which Scott had noted with concern as early as 23 January, declined sharply.{{sfn|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. I | p=551}} A fall on 4 February had left Evans "dull and incapable",{{sfn|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. I | p=560}} and on 17 February, after another fall, he died near the glacier foot.{{sfn|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. I | pp=572–573}} With 400&amp;nbsp;miles (670&amp;nbsp;km) still to travel across the [[Ross Ice Shelf]], Scott's party's prospects steadily worsened as, with deteriorating weather, a puzzling lack of fuel in the depots, hunger and exhaustion, they struggled northward.{{sfn|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. I | pp=574–580}}

Meanwhile, back at Cape Evans, ''Terra Nova'' arrived at the beginning of February, and Atkinson decided to unload the supplies from the ship with his own men rather than set out south with the dogs to meet Scott as ordered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/antarctica/robert-falcon-scott/9770678/Scott-of-the-Antarctic-could-have-been-saved-if-his-orders-had-been-followed-say-scientists.html "Karen May &amp; Peter Forster on Cherry-Garrard's 1948 postscript"], The Telegraph. Retrieved 12 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; When Atkinson belatedly left for the planned rendezvous with Scott, he was delayed at Hut Point by bad weather from 13–18 February, when Tom Crean arrived through a blizzard with news of the collapse of Teddy Evans. After effecting a rescue of Evans who needed urgent medical attention, Atkinson tried to assign the experienced navigator Wright south to meet Scott, but chief meteorologist Simpson declared he needed Wright for scientific work. Atkinson then decided to send the short-sighted [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]] on 25 February, too late to reach the original rendezvous at latitude 82 or 82.30 on 1 March. Cherry-Garrard reached One Ton Depot, on March 4th and was left to make his own decision on whether to proceed further. He had just enough dog food to run to the next depot and then dash for home but Scott's original timetable would have made it possible to pass Scott travelling in the opposite direction, if he attempted to proceed further. Cherry-Garrard decided that it was better to wait for Scott rather than risk failing to meet him on the march. At the limit of his supplies he turned for home on 10 March barely making it through the worsening weather, reaching Hut Point on 16 March with both men and dogs unfit for further travel.&lt;ref&gt;E R G R Evans: South With Scott p245/246. Collins London 1953&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the return journey from the Pole, Scott reached the 82.00°S meeting point for the dog teams, 300 miles from Hut Point, three days ahead of schedule, noting in his diary for 27 February 1912 "We are naturally always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, but there is a horrid element of doubt." On 2 March Oates began to suffer from the effects of frostbite and the party's progress slowed as he was increasingly unable to assist in the workload, eventually only able to drag himself alongside the men pulling the sledge. By 10 March the temperature had dropped unexpectedly to below {{convert|-40|C|F}},{{sfn|Solomon|pp=292–94}} and it became evident the dog teams were not coming: "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [the dog-driver] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble."  In a farewell letter to [[Edgar Speyer|Sir Edgar Speyer]], dated 16 March, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support."{{sfn|May|2013|pp=1–19}} On the same day, Oates, whose toes had become frostbitten,&lt;ref&gt;"Oates disclosed his feet, the toes showing very bad indeed, evidently bitten by the late temperatures" Scott diary entry, 2 March 1912. "The result is telling on ... Oates, whose feet are in a wretched condition. One swelled up tremendously last night and he is very lame this morning" Scott diary entry 5 March 1912. "Titus Oates is very near the end"&amp;nbsp;– Scott diary entry, 17 March 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; voluntarily left the tent and walked to his death.{{sfn|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. I | pp=591–592}} Scott wrote that Oates' last words were "I am just going outside and may be some time".{{sfn|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. I | p=592}}

After walking 20&amp;nbsp;miles farther despite Scott's toes now becoming frostbitten,&lt;ref&gt;"My right foot has gone, nearly all the toes – two days ago I was proud possessor of best feet. These are the steps of my downfall. Like an ass I mixed a small spoonful of curry powder with my melted pemmican – it gave me violent indigestion. I lay awake and in pain all night; woke and felt done on the march; foot went and I didn't know it. A very small measure of neglect and have a foot which is not pleasant to contemplate." Scott's diary 18 March 1912&lt;/ref&gt; the three remaining men made their final camp on 19 March, {{convert|11|mi|km|}} short of One Ton Depot. The next day a fierce blizzard prevented their making any progress.{{sfn|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. I | p=594}} During the next nine days, as their supplies ran out, and with storms still raging outside the tent, Scott and his companions wrote their farewell letters. Scott gave up his diary after 23 March, save for a final entry on 29 March, with its concluding words: "Last entry. For God's sake look after our people".{{sfn|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. I | p=595}} He left letters to Wilson's mother, Bowers' mother, a string of notables including his former commander [[George Egerton (Royal Navy officer)|Sir George Egerton]], his own mother and his wife.{{sfn|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. I | pp=597–604}} He also wrote his "Message to the Public", primarily a vindication of the expedition's organisation and conduct in which the party's failure is attributed to weather and other misfortunes, but ending on an inspirational note, with these words:

{{quote| We took risks, we knew we took them; things have come out against us, and therefore we have no cause for complaint, but bow to the will of Providence, determined still to do our best to the last&amp;nbsp;... Had we lived, I should have had a tale to tell of the hardihood, endurance, and courage of my companions which would have stirred the heart of every Englishman. These rough notes and our dead bodies must tell the tale, but surely, surely, a great rich country like ours will see that those who are dependent on us are properly provided for.&lt;ref&gt;From "Scott's Message to the Public", {{harvnb|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. I | pp=605–607}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Scott is presumed to have died on 29 March 1912, or possibly one day later. The positions of the bodies in the tent when it was discovered eight months later suggested that Scott was the last of the three to die.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. I | p=596}}; {{harvnb|Jones|p=126}}. {{harvnb|Huntford, ''The Last Place on Earth''|p=509}} says that Bowers was probably the last to die, citing evidence on p. 528.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cross on Observation Hill, McMurdo Station.jpg|thumb|The [[Observation Hill (McMurdo Station)|Observation Hill]] cross, erected in 1913 as a memorial to Scott and his party]]
The bodies of Scott and his companions were discovered by a search party on 12 November 1912 and their records retrieved. Their final camp became their tomb; a high cairn of snow was erected over it, topped by a roughly fashioned cross.{{sfn|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. II | pp=345–347}} In January 1913, before ''Terra Nova'' left for home, a large wooden cross was made by the ship's carpenters, inscribed with the names of the lost party and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s line from his poem [[Ulysses (poem)|''Ulysses'']]: "To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield", and was erected as a permanent memorial on [[Observation Hill (McMurdo Station)|Observation Hill]], overlooking [[Hut Point]].{{sfn|Huxley, ''Scott's Last Expedition'', Vol. II | p=398}}

A century of storms and snow have covered the cairn and tent, which are now encased in the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] as it inches towards the Ross Sea. In 2001 glaciologist [[Charles R. Bentley]] estimated that the tent with the bodies was under about 75&amp;nbsp;feet (23&amp;nbsp;m) of ice and about 30&amp;nbsp;miles (48&amp;nbsp;km) from the point where they died; he speculated that in about 275 years the bodies would reach the Ross Sea, and perhaps float away inside an iceberg.{{sfn|''USA Today''|16 January 2001}}

=== Recognition ===
The world was informed of the tragedy when ''Terra Nova'' reached [[Oamaru]], New Zealand, on 10 February 1913.{{sfn|Crane|pp=1–2}} Within days, Scott became a national icon.{{sfn|Preston|p=230}} A nationalistic spirit was aroused; the ''[[London Evening News]]'' called for the story to be read to schoolchildren throughout the land,{{sfn|Jones|pp=199–201}} to coincide with the memorial service at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] on 14 February. [[Robert Baden-Powell]], founder of the [[Boy Scouts Association]], asked: "Are Britons going downhill? No!&amp;nbsp;... There is plenty of pluck and spirit left in the British after all. Captain Scott and Captain Oates have shown us that".{{sfn|Jones|p=204}} Eleven-year-old Mary Steel wrote a poem which ended:

The expedition's survivors were suitably honoured on their return, with polar medals and promotions for the naval personnel. In place of the knighthood that might have been her husband's had he survived, Kathleen Scott was granted the rank and precedence of a widow of a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]].{{sfn|Preston|p=231}}&lt;ref&gt;This honour did not entitle Kathleen to call herself "Lady Scott". Although both {{harvnb|Fiennes|p=383}} and {{harvnb|Huntford, ''The Last Place on Earth''|p=523}}, refer to her as "Lady Scott", this is not in accordance with ''The Times'' announcement (22 February 1913).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, she married [[Edward Hilton Young, 1st Baron Kennet|Edward Hilton Young]], later Lord Kennet (rendering her Lady Kennet), and remained a doughty defender of Scott's reputation until her death, aged 69, in 1947.{{sfn|Preston|p=232}}

An article in ''[[The Times]]'', reporting on the glowing tributes paid to Scott in the New York press, claimed that both Amundsen and Shackleton were "[amazed] to hear that such a disaster could overtake a well-organized expedition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Unattributed | title = The Polar Disaster. Captain Scott's Career, Naval Officer And Explorer | work = The Times | page = 10 | date = 11 February 1913 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On learning the details of Scott's death, Amundsen is reported to have said, "I would gladly forgo any honour or money if thereby I could have saved Scott his terrible death".{{sfn|Huntford, ''The Last Place on Earth''|p=525}} Scott was the better wordsmith of the two, and the story that spread throughout the world was largely that told by him, with Amundsen's victory reduced in the eyes of many to an unsporting stratagem.{{sfn|Amundsen|loc=publisher's note, 1976 edition}}

The response to Scott's final plea on behalf of the dependents of the dead was enormous by the standards of the day. The Mansion House Scott Memorial Fund closed at £75,000 (2009 approximation £5.5&amp;nbsp;million). This was not equally distributed; Scott's widow, son, mother and sisters received a total of £18,000 (£1.3&amp;nbsp;million). Wilson's widow got £8,500 (£600,000) and Bowers's mother £4,500 (£330,000). Edgar Evans's widow, children, and mother received £1,500 (£109,000) between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|pp=106–108}}. £34,000 (2009 = £2.5m) in total went to relatives, £17,500 (£1.2&amp;nbsp;million) to the publication of the scientific results, £5,100 (£370,000) to meet expedition debts, and the balance to the creation of suitable monuments and memorials.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;All present-day values calculated on RPI basis per {{harvnb|Measuring Worth}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the dozen years following the disaster, more than 30 monuments and memorials were set up in Britain alone. These ranged from simple relics (e.g., Scott's sledging flag in Exeter Cathedral) to the foundation of the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]] at [[Cambridge]]. Many more were established in other parts of the world, including a [[Scott Statue|statue]] sculpted by Scott's widow for his New Zealand base in Christchurch.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Jones|pp=295–96}} for a full listing of British memorials.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Captain Scott Memorial}}

It portrays the team spirit of the expedition and the harsh Antarctic environment, but also includes critical scenes such as Scott regarding his broken down motors and ruefully remembering Nansen's advice to take only dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/457209|title=BFI Screenonline: Scott of the Antarctic (1948)|website=www.screenonline.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans and Cherry-Garrard were the only surviving expedition members to refuse participation in the film, but both re-published their respective books in its wake.

In 1966, Reginald Pound, the first biographer given access to Scott's original sledging journal, revealed personal failings which cast a new light on Scott,{{sfn|Jones|pp=287–289}} although Pound continued to endorse his heroism, writing of "a splendid sanity that would not be subdued".{{sfn|Pound|pp=285–286}} Another book critical of Scott, [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]]'s ''Scott's Men'', was released in 1977. In Thomson's view, Scott was not a great man, "at least, not until near the end";{{sfn|Thomson|pp=Preface, xiii}} his planning is described as "haphazard" and "flawed",{{sfn|Thomson|pp=153 and 218}} his leadership characterised by lack of foresight.{{sfn|Thomson|p=233}} Thus by the late 1970s, in Jones's words, "Scott's complex personality had been revealed and his methods questioned".{{sfn|Jones|pp=287–289}}

In 1979 came the first extreme&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fiennes|p=386}} Francis Spufford, author of ''It may be some time'' wrote: "Huntford's assault on Scott was so extreme it plainly toppled over into absurdity"&lt;/ref&gt; attack on Scott, from [[Roland Huntford]]'s dual biography ''Scott and Amundsen'' in which Scott is depicted as a "heroic bungler".{{sfn|Huntford, ''The Last Place on Earth''|p=527}} Huntford's thesis had an immediate impact, becoming the contemporary orthodoxy.{{sfn|Jones|p=8}} After Huntford's book, several other mostly negative books about Captain Scott were published; [[Francis Spufford]], in a 1996 history not wholly antagonistic to Scott, refers to "devastating evidence of bungling",{{sfn|Spufford|p=5}} concluding that "Scott doomed his companions, then covered his tracks with rhetoric".{{sfn|Spufford|pp=104–105}} Travel writer [[Paul Theroux]] summarised Scott as "confused and demoralised&amp;nbsp;... an enigma to his men, unprepared and a bungler".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|Barczewski|p=260}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This decline in Scott's reputation was accompanied by a corresponding rise in that of his erstwhile rival Shackleton, at first in the United States but eventually in Britain as well.{{sfn|Barczewski|p=283}} A 2002 nationwide poll in the United Kingdom to discover the "[[100 Greatest Britons]]" showed Shackleton in eleventh place, Scott well down the list at 54th.{{sfn|Barczewski|p=283}}

The 21st century has seen a shift of opinion in Scott's favour, in what cultural historian Stephanie Barczewski calls "a revision of the revisionist view".{{sfn|Barczewski|pp=305–311}} Meteorologist [[Susan Solomon]]'s 2001 account ''The Coldest March'' ties the fate of Scott's party to the extraordinarily adverse Barrier weather conditions of February and March 1912 rather than to personal or organisational failings and, while not entirely questioning any criticism of Scott,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|pp=309–327}}; see also {{harvnb|Barczewski|p=306}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon principally characterises the criticism as the "Myth of Scott as a bungler". {{sfn|Solomon|p=xvi, xvii, 124, 129}}

In 2004 polar explorer Sir [[Ranulph Fiennes]] published a biography which was a strong defence of Scott and an equally forthright rebuttal of Huntford; the book is dedicated "To the Families of the Defamed Dead".{{sfn|Barczewski|pp=305–311}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fiennes}}'s book was published in the United States as ''Race to the Pole: Tragedy, Heroism and Scott's Antarctic Quest''. {{harvnb|Barczewski|p=378}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fiennes was later criticised for his assumption that his own experiences as a polar explorer made him "almost the only person who could write authoritatively on the subject".{{sfn|''The New York Times''|3 December 2006}}

In 2005 [[David Crane (historian)|David Crane]] published a new Scott biography in which he comes to the conclusion that Scott is possibly the only figure in polar history except Lawrence Oates "so wholly obscured by legend".{{sfn|Cranei|p=373}} According to Barczewski, he goes some way towards an assessment of Scott "free from the baggage of earlier interpretations".{{sfn|Barczewski|pp=305–311}} What has happened to Scott's reputation, Crane argues, derives from the way the world has changed since the "hopeless heroism and obscene waste" of the First World War. At the time of Scott's death, people clutched at the proof he gave that the qualities that once made Britain great were not extinct, but with the knowledge of what lay only two years ahead, the ideals of duty, self-sacrifice, discipline, patriotism and hierarchy associated with his tragedy take on a different and more sinister colouring.{{sfn|Crane|p=12}}{{sfn|Crane|p=12 "It is not that we see him differently from the way they [his contemporaries] did, but that we see him the same, and instinctively do not like it."}} Crane's main achievement, according to Barczewski, is the restoration of Scott's humanity, "far more effectively than either Fiennes's stridency or Solomon's scientific data."{{sfn|Barczewski|pp=305–311}} ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' columnist Jasper Rees, likening the changes in explorers' reputations to climatic variations, suggests that "in the current Antarctic weather report, Scott is enjoying his first spell in the sun for twenty-five years".{{sfn|''Daily Telegraph''|19 December 2004}} The ''New York Times Book Review'' was more critical, pointing out Crane's support for Scott's account regarding the circumstances of the freeing of the ''Discovery'' from the pack ice, and concluded that "For all the many attractions of his book, David Crane offers no answers that convincingly exonerate Scott from a significant share of responsibility for his own demise."{{sfn|''The New York Times''|3 December 2006}}

In 2012, Karen May published her discovery that Scott had issued written orders, before his march to the Pole, for Meares to meet the returning party with dog-teams, in contrast to Huntford's assertion in 1979 that Scott issued those vital instructions only as a casual oral order to Evans during the march to the Pole. According to May, "Huntford's scenario was pure invention based on an error; it has led a number of polar historians down a regrettable false trail".{{sfn|May|2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16605">'''Robert W. Kates''' (January 31, 1929 – April 21, 2018) was an American geographer and independent scholar in [[Trenton, Maine]], and University Professor (Emeritus) at [[Brown University]].

==Background==
Kates was born in Brooklyn, New York. Unusually for an academic, he never completed an undergraduate degree. He studied Economics at New York University from 1946-8, but dropped out. He married Ellie Hackman (d.2016) at the age of 19 and went to work in a steel mill in Indiana for 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umaine.edu/sustainabilitysolutions/about/Kates_article.html&lt;/ref&gt; He had a chance encounter with a naturalist in a state park in Indiana when on vacation with his family, and this meeting inspired him to train to become an elementary school teacher, a job he thought would free up summer vacations for the family. To realise this career he signed up for night school at Indiana University, Gary in 1957, when aged 28. One of his classes to become a teacher was in geography. Having found his calling and his discipline, he sought study advice from [[Gilbert F. White]] at the [[University of Chicago]]. White gave him some key texts to read, Kates returned to discuss them, White recognized his abilities and steered him through an MA and eventually a PhD in Geography (1962). Kates taught at the Graduate School of Geography, [[Clark University]] from 1962 until 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/telegram/obituary.aspx?n=robert-kates&amp;pid=188870248&lt;/ref&gt; At Clark he founded CENTED (the Centre for technology, environment, and development), now part of the Marsh Institute, where he remained a Distinguished Scientist. He worked in Africa with Clark colleagues, and also developed and directed a resource assessment centre at the [[University of Dar Es Salaam]], Tanzania (from 1967–68).

Kates helped to establish the international Initiative for Science and Technology for [[Sustainability]], was Executive Editor of ''Environment'' magazine for many years, and was a Senior Associate at Harvard University.

From 1986 to 1992 he was Professor and Director of the interdisciplinary World Hunger Program at Brown University. Kates retired relatively early, became an 'independent scholar' and moved to Trenton, Maine overlooking the Narrows in the early 1990s. Kates had three children, 6 grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;http://obituaries.bangordailynews.com/obituary/robert-kates-1929-2018-1057279836 | Obituary&lt;/ref&gt; He remained professionally active until his mid 80s and in 2008 (at age 79), was appointed the inaugural Presidential Professor of [[Sustainability]] Science at the University of Maine, Orono.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umaine.edu/sustainabilitysolutions/about/Kates_article.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
Kates's research focused on long-term trends in environment, development, and population, and he is particularly known for his work on [[natural hazard]]s [[Disaster mitigation|mitigation]], driven by a Quaker belief in relevance to human society. Kates defines his central question as "What is and ought to be the human use of the Earth?" This led him to address the human use of [[natural resources]] and human response to hazards. His approach was to set up "natural" experiments, and then to develop a set of comparative observations or analogs. This led to several studies of natural and technological hazards, rural resource and water development, and methodologies for studying people's perception of the environment, the assessment of risk, and the impacts of [[climate]] on society. Since retiring from Brown University he continued to work on:

*the sustainability transition
*long-term population dynamics
*global environmental change

Kates was awarded honorary DSc degrees from [[Clark University]] for his many contributions to hazards research (1993) and from the [[University of Maine]] (2004).

==Critique==
Kates's  work on hazards, and his 'human ecology' approach, some of it coauthored with Ian Burton (Burton and Kates 1978), attracted critique from scholars including [[Michael Watts]] (1983a, b) and former student Ben Wisner (1976, 2004). The insight of these critiques is that "natural" hazards are in fact exacerbated by political and economic forces, and they should be seen as "social", not "natural". To suggest that severe drought - or even the flooding of New Orleans - are "natural" underplays the ways that powerful political and economic interests ''make'' people more vulnerable. Humans cannot "adapt" or, in Kates's language, "adjust" successfully to hazards when a population is highly vulnerable or even exploited (Watts, 1983a). Mitigating natural hazards is therefore a social justice issue, not a case of adjustment. This has been much-debated in Wisner et al.'s ''At Risk'' (2004).

The '''Royal Botanic Gardens''' in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] is located in [[Port of Spain]]. The Gardens, which were established in 1818, are situated just north of the [[Queen's Park Savannah]]. This is one of the oldest Botanic Gardens in the world.  The landscaped site occupies 61.8 acres (25 hectares) and contains some 700 trees, of which some 13% are indigenous to Trinidad and Tobago, whilst others are collected from every continent of the world .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgci.org/garden.php?id=904 Botanic gardens conservation International]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gardens are open to the public every day of the year from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.

The grounds include a small burial plot in which former Governors of Trinidad have been buried since 1819.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvent.com/rfp/trinidad-and-tobago-guide/things-to-do-ebb6ba91d0b84a0b9bc890a8947d7b5e.aspx Trinidad and Tobago guide: things-to-do]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Meaning of Liff''''' (UK Edition: {{ISBN|0-330-28121-6}}, US Edition: {{ISBN|0-517-55347-3}}) is a humorous [[dictionary]] of [[toponymy]] and [[etymology]], written by [[Douglas Adams]] and [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]],&lt;ref name="GD"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/15/douglas-adams-meaning-of-liff|title=Douglas Adams's Meaning of Liff redefined|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=15 October 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the United Kingdom in 1983 and the United States in 1984.

==Content==
The book is a "dictionary of things that there aren't any words for yet".&lt;ref name="art1"&gt;Gartner, Michael (15 March 1987). [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/104356826.html?dids=104356826:104356826&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+15%2C+1987&amp;author=By+Michael+Gartner&amp;pub=Newsday+%28Combined+editions%29&amp;desc=WORDS&amp;pqatl=google Words], ''[[Newsday]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than inventing new words, Adams and Lloyd picked a number of existing place-names and assigned interesting meanings to them,&lt;ref name="parkvall"&gt;{{cite book|title=Limits of Language: Almost Everything You Didn't Know about Language and Languages|first=Mikael|last=Parkvall|year=2006|publisher=William James &amp; Company|isbn=1590281985}}&lt;/ref&gt; meanings that can be regarded as on the verge of social existence and ready to become recognisable entities.&lt;ref name="kalaga"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nebulae of discourse: interpretation, textuality and the subject|first=Wojciech|last=Kalaga|year=1997|publisher=Peter Lang Pub.|isbn=082043289X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the words listed are [[toponyms]] and describe common feelings and objects for which there is no current English word. Examples are ''[[Shoeburyness]]'' ("The vague uncomfortable feeling you get when sitting on a seat that is still warm from somebody else's bottom") and ''[[Plymouth]]'' ("To relate an amusing story to someone without remembering that it was they who told it to you in the first place").

The book cover usually bears the tagline "This book will change your life", either as part of its cover or as an [[adhesive label]]. ''[[Liff, Angus|Liff]]'' (a village near [[Dundee]] in Scotland) is then defined in the book as "A book, the contents of which are totally belied by its cover. For instance, any book the [[dust jacket]] of which bears the words, 'This book will change your life'."

==Origin and publication==
According to Adams' account, the idea behind ''The Meaning of Liff'' grew out of an old school game and started when he and Lloyd were on holiday together in [[Corfu]] in 1978 during the writing of the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (novel)|first Hitchhiker's novel]].&lt;ref name=GD/&gt;&lt;ref name=hitchhiker&gt;{{cite book|title=Hitchhiker|first=M.J.|last=Simpson|year=2003|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|isbn=0-340-82489-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was used as part of the ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'' spin-off book ''Not 1982'' ({{ISBN|0-571-11853-4}}), where they were headed "Today's new word from the Oxtail English Dictionary". The suggestion of turning this into a complete book in itself came from Faber MD [[Matthew Evans, Baron Evans of Temple Guiting|Matthew Evans]]. The bulk of the text was written by Adams and Lloyd in Summer 1982 in [[Malibu, California]].&lt;ref name=hitchhiker /&gt;

Essentially the same idea was used by the English humourist [[Paul Jennings (UK author)|Paul Jennings]] in an article ''Ware, Wye, Watford'', published in the late 1950s. Adams speculated that the teacher who originated the school game may have done so after reading the article. He sent a note of apology to Jennings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Don't Panic: Douglas Adams &amp; The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy|isbn=1-85286-411-7|first=Neil|last=Gaiman|publisher=Titan Books|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow humourist [[Miles Kington]] defended Adams and Lloyd in his column in ''The Times'', noting a difference in style.

The book was released in the UK in November 1983 in time for the Christmas market. It was a commercial success for [[Pan Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The rising of the lark: Britain's best-selling books|date=29 December 1983|publisher=Financial Times|first=Arthur|last=Sandles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the book was chosen to be very similar to [[Monty Python]]'s film ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life|The Meaning of Life]]'' that was being produced at the same time, after Douglas Adams called [[Terry Jones]] to ask if it would be OK. Adams' idea was that the potential confusion with the film's script would help to sell more copies of the book.&lt;ref&gt;John Lloyd explained this in a BBC Radio 4 Documentary of the Week, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the book's publication, which included guest star Terry Jones (first aired 1 March 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in the beginning of the Monty Python film, the gravestone with the title "The Meaning of Liff" appears before a lightning bolt strikes the last F and converts it to an E.

==Versions==
A revised and expanded edition of the original book, with about twice as many definitions, was published in 1990 as '''''The Deeper Meaning of Liff''''' (UK Edition: {{ISBN|0-330-31606-0}}, US Edition: {{ISBN|0-517-58597-9}}), though the original remains in print. Some of the new words in ''Deeper'' had previously appeared in a Liff piece by Adams, Lloyd and [[Stephen Fry]] in ''[[The Utterly Utterly Merry Comic Relief Christmas Book]]'' (1986). The main differences between the two editions (for either version of the book) are those of American English v. British English spellings, though ''The Deeper Meaning of Liff'' contains different definitions for both the word "Glossop" and the titular word "Liff". In ''The Deeper Meaning of Liff'', Liff is defined as a phenomenon for which there is no word.

Another edition in the series, ''Afterliff'', has been released, with more entries contributed by Lloyd, [[Jon Canter]] and Douglas Adams' daughter Polly.&lt;ref name=GD /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/09/afterliff-douglas-adams-jon-canter|title=Afterliff: The spirit of Douglas Adams|last=Canter|first=Jon|date=9 August 2013|work=[[theguardian.com]]|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 August 2013, a 30th anniversary deluxe edition was published.&lt;ref name="deluxe1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://upcoming4.me/news/book-news/the-30th-anniversary-edition-of-the-meaning-of-liff-by-douglas-adams-and-john-lloyd-coming-out-on-15th-august|title=The 30th Anniversary edition of The Meaning of Liff by Douglas Adams and John Lloyd coming out on 15th August |last=|first=|date=7 October 2013|work=Upcoming4.me|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A German adaptation was made by Sven Böttcher under the title ''Der tiefere Sinn des Labenz'', published in 1992 ({{ISBN|3-453-87960-0}}). The meanings are translated from the original but are matched to place names that convey the humorous effect in German. The most recent edition includes both the German adaptation and the English original ({{ISBN|3-453-87960-0}}).
 
In 1989, a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] version was published under the title ''Kunt U Breukelen?'' by Justus van Oel (Nijgh &amp; van Ditmar, {{ISBN|90 236 7311 5}}), utilising the same book size format as the standard UK version, 9.1 x 16.8&amp;nbsp;cm. The book used place names mainly from the Netherlands, as well as a handful from neighbouring Belgium and [[Luxembourg]]. There was no hardback edition, and neither was ''The Deeper Meaning of Liff'' adapted for the Dutch market. It was reissued in 2000 with a different cover.

The Finnish adaptations "Elimäen tarkoitus" and "Elimäen perimmäinen tarkoitus" were published in 1996 and 1997 ({{ISBN|952-9646-26-7}} and {{ISBN|952-9646-52-6}}).

Following the 2005 movie and the TV adaptations of ''[[Last Chance to See]]'' and ''Dirk Gently'', there was talk from ITV, never as yet acted upon, of a TV version of ''The Meaning Of Liff''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Comedian Anders Lund Madsen wrote a Danish version with the title ''Madsens ÆØÅ - Dictionary of things for which there funnily enough not yet exists words for'', published 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''''Victoria''''' (or '''Nao ''Victoria''''', as well as '''''Vittoria''''') was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[carrack]] and the first ship to successfully [[circumnavigate]] the world. ''Victoria'' was part of a [[Armada de Molucca|Spanish expedition]] commanded by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]], and after his death during the voyage, by [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]]. The expedition began on August 10, 1519 with five ships. However, ''Victoria'' was the only ship to complete the voyage, returning on September 6, 1522.&lt;ref name=princeton/&gt; Magellan was killed in the [[Philippines]]. The ship was built at a shipyard in [[Gipuzkoa]], with the Basques being reputed shipbuilders at the time, and along with the four other ships, she was given to Magellan by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I]] of [[Spain]] (The Holy Roman Emperor Charles V). ''Victoria'' was named after the church of Santa Maria de la Victoria de Triana, where Magellan took an oath of allegiance to Charles&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref name=princeton/&gt; ''Victoria'' was an 85-ton ship with a crew of 42.

The four other ships were ''[[Trinidad (ship)|Trinidad]]'' (110 tons, crew&amp;nbsp;55), ''[[San Antonio (spanish ship)|San Antonio]]'' (120 tons, crew&amp;nbsp;60), ''[[Concepcion (ship)|Concepcion]]'' (90 tons, crew&amp;nbsp;45), and ''[[Santiago (spanish ship)|Santiago]]'' (75 tons, crew&amp;nbsp;32). ''Trinidad'', Magellan's [[flagship]], ''Concepcion'', and ''Santiago'' were wrecked or [[scuttling|scuttled]]; ''San Antonio'' deserted the expedition during the navigation of the [[Straits of Magellan]] and returned to Europe on her own.

''Victoria'' was a [[carrack]] or ''nao'', as were all the others except ''Santiago'', which was a [[caravel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcgoodwin.net/pages/otherbooks/lb_overedgeworld.html]. Laurence Bergreen ”Over the Edge of the World”, Summary by Michael McGoodwin, prepared 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crew ==
The voyage started with a crew of about 265 men aboard 5 ships. Of all these, only 18 men returned alive on ''Victoria''. Many of the men died of malnutrition. At the beginning of the voyage, [[Luis de Mendoza]] was her captain. On April 2, 1520, after establishing a settlement they called [[Puerto San Julian]] located in Patagonia, a fierce mutiny involving three captains broke out, which was ultimately quelled.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;*{{cite book |first1=Patrick J. |last1=Murphy |first2=Ray W. |last2=Coye |title=Mutiny and Its Bounty: Leadership Lessons from the Age of Discovery |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/Book.asp?isbn=9780300170283 |date=2013|publisher=Yale University Press|ISBN=9780300170283 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonio Pigafetta]]'s and other reports state that Luis de Mendoza and Gaspar Quesada, captain of ''Concepcion'', were executed and the remains hung on gallows on the shore.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewAdvent09526b&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09526b.htm|title=Ferdinand Magellan|publisher=New Advent|work=Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=14 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juan de Cartagena]], captain of ''San Antonio'', was [[Marooning|marooned]] on the coast. [[Duarte Barbosa]], a Portuguese who had sided with Magellan in facing the mutiny, then became the captain of ''Victoria''. According to Pigafetta, after Magellan's death on April 27, 1521, at the [[Battle of Mactan]], remnants of the fleet tried to retrieve Magellan's body without success. Thereafter, Duarte Barbosa and [[João Serrão]] were elected leaders of the expedition. On May 1, 1521, they were invited by [[rajah Humabon]] of [[Cebu]], of the Philippines to a banquet ashore to receive a gift for the king of Spain. There most were killed or poisoned, including Duarte Barbosa and João Serrão, who was brought by natives who wanted to exchange him for weapons, but was left behind. Pilot João Carvalho, who had survived the trap, then became the captain of ''Victoria''. In August, near [[Borneo]] he was deposed and [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] became captain for the remainder of the expedition.

Out of an entire expedition of 260 people, only 18 returned to [[Seville]] with the expedition (many others deserted), which by the end was only made up of the crew of ''Victoria''.

Out of all these survivors, [[Antonio Pigafetta]] was the most significant because his journals supply most of the information known about the first expedition around the world.

== Voyage ==
The long circumnavigation began in Seville in 1519 and returned to [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]] on September 6, 1522, after traveling {{convert|42000|mi|km|order=flip}}, {{convert|22000|mi|km|order=flip}} of which was largely unknown to the crew. On December 21, 1521, ''Victoria'' sailed on from [[Tidore]] in [[Indonesia]] alone because the other ships left the convoy due to lack of rations. The ship was in terrible shape, with her sails torn and only kept afloat by continuous pumping of water. ''Victoria'' managed to return to Spain with a shipload of spices, the value of which was greater than the cost of the entire original fleet.&lt;ref name=princeton&gt;{{cite web | url=http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/maps/websites/pacific/magellan/magellan.html | title=Fernão de Magalhães, d. 1521 (Ferdinand Magellan) | first=John | last=Delaney | work=Strait Through: Magellan to Cook &amp; the Pacific  | publisher=[[Princeton University]] | year=2010 | accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Victoria'' was later repaired, bought by a merchant shipper and sailed for almost another fifty years before being lost with all hands on a trip from the [[Antilles]] to [[Seville]] in about 1570.&lt;ref name=Bergreen/&gt;

==Legacy==
A vignette of the ''Victoria'' forms the logo of the [[Hakluyt Society]], a London-based [[text publication society]] founded in 1846, which publishes scholarly editions of [[Primary source|primary records]] of historic voyages, travels and other geographical material. The logo appears on the cover of all the Society's published volumes.

===Replicas===
A replica of the ship was built in 1992 and is operated by the Fundación Nao Victoria, [[Seville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nao Victoria|url= http://www.fundacionnaovictoria.org/ |publisher=Fundación Nao Victoria|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, to celebrate the [[Bicentennial of Chile]], an entrepreneur from [[Punta Arenas]] founded [[Museo Nao Victoria|a project]] to build another replica of the ship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlasvivodechile.com/replica-de-la-nao-victoria?f=1 Atlas Vivo de Chile – Nao Victoria] www.atlasvivodechile.com Retrieved August 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The search for the original plans{{Clarify|date=January 2017|reason=Drawings can hardly have survived if any ever existed}} of ''Nao Victoria'' took longer than expected and the project was delayed by almost three years, from 2006 to 2009. The replica was finally completed by 2011. Although it was not possible to complete the project in time for the celebration of the bicentennial in 2010, the project’s creator received a Presidential Medal from the [[President of Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionatales.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=909:presidente-sebastian-pinera-expreso-compromiso-de-su-gobierno-con-el-plan-magallanes-ya-esta-en-plena-etapa-de-planificacion-el-hospital-de-puerto-natales&amp;catid=1:noticias-natales&amp;Itemid=2|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909092348/http://www.radionatales.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=909:presidente-sebastian-pinera-expreso-compromiso-de-su-gobierno-con-el-plan-magallanes-ya-esta-en-plena-etapa-de-planificacion-el-hospital-de-puerto-natales&amp;catid=1:noticias-natales&amp;Itemid=2|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 September 2012|title=Presidente Sebastian Pinera expreso compromiso...|work=Radio Natales|language=Spanish|date=16 August 2010|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''waypoint''' is an intermediate point or place on a route or line of travel, a stopping point or point at which course is changed,&lt;ref name = oxford&gt;{{cite web|author = Oxford Staff | date = January 26, 2017 | url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/waypoint | title=Waypoint—Definition… in English | work=OxfordDictionaries.com | access-date=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=merriamwebster&gt;{{cite web | author=MW Staff | date= January 26, 2017 | title=Definition of Waypoint | work=Merriam-Webster.com | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/waypoint | access-date=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; first use of the term tracing to 1880.&lt;ref name=merriamwebster/&gt; In modern terms, it most often refers to coordinates which specify one's position on the globe at the end of each "leg" (stage) of an air flight or sea passage, the generation and checking of which are generally done computationally (with a computer or other programmed device).&lt;ref name = oxford/&gt;

Hence, the term connotes a reference point in physical space, most often associated with [[navigation]], especially in the sea or air—e.g., in the case of sea navigation, a [[longitude|longitudinal]] and [[latitude|latitudinal]] coordinate or a GPS point in open water, a location near a known mapped shoal or other entity in a body of water, a point a fixed distance off of a geographical entity such as a lighthouse or harbour entrance, etc.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} When such a point corresponds to an element of physical geography on land, it can be referred to as a [[landmark]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In air navigation, waypoints most often consist of a series of abstract GPS points that create artificial airways—"highways in the sky"—created specifically for purposes of air navigation that have no clear connection to features of the real world.

==Concept==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
Waypoints are sets of [[coordinates]] that identify a [[Point (geometry)|point]] in physical space. Coordinates used can vary depending on the application. For [[navigation|terrestrial navigation]] these coordinates can include [[longitude]] and [[latitude]]. [[Air navigation]] also includes [[altitude]]. Waypoints have only become widespread for navigational use by the layman since the development of advanced navigational systems, such as the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) and certain other types of radio navigation. Waypoints located on the surface of the Earth are usually defined in two dimensions (''e.g.,'' longitude and latitude); those used in the Earth's atmosphere or in outer space are defined in at least three dimensions (four if time is one of the coordinates, as it might be for some waypoints outside the Earth).

Although the term ''waypoint'' has only entered common use in recent years, the equivalent of a waypoint in all but name has existed for as long as human beings have navigated. Waypoints have traditionally been associated with distinctive features of the real world, such as [[Rock (geology)|rock]] formations, [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s, [[oasis|oases]], [[mountain]]s, buildings, roadways, waterways, railways, and so on.  Today, these associations persist, but waypoints are more often associated with physical artifacts created specifically for navigation, such as [[radio beacon]]s, [[buoy]]s, [[satellite]]s, [[Control point (orienteering)|control points]], etc.

In the modern world, waypoints are increasingly abstract, often having no obvious relationship to any distinctive features of the real world. These waypoints are used to help define invisible routing paths for navigation. For example, artificial [[Airway (aviation)|airways]]—"highways in the sky" created specifically for purposes of air navigation—often have no clear connection to features of the real world, and consist only of a series of abstract waypoints in the sky through which pilots navigate; these airways are designed to facilitate air traffic control and routing of traffic between heavily traveled locations, and do not reference natural terrain features.  Abstract waypoints of this kind have been made practical by modern navigation technologies, such as land-based radio beacons and the satellite-based GPS.

Abstract waypoints typically have only specified longitude and latitude or [[Universal Transverse Mercator|UTM]] coordinates plus the reference [[data|datum]], and often a name if they are marked on charts, and are located using a [[radio navigation]] system such as a [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] or GPS receiver. A waypoint can be a destination, a fix along a planned [[course (navigation)|course]] used to make a journey, or simply a point of reference useful for navigation.

==Modern applications==
==={{Anchor|Waypoints and GPS}} With GPS===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
GPS systems are increasingly used to create and use waypoints in navigation of all kinds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://support.garmin.com/support/searchSupport/case.faces?caseId=%7Bfb246bf0-0546-11dc-cded-000000000000%7D What is a Waypoint?] [[Garmin]]. Retrieved 11 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; A typical GPS receiver can locate a waypoint with an accuracy of three meters or better when used with land-based assisting technologies such as the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS). Waypoints can also be marked on a computer mapping program and uploaded to the GPS receiver, marked on the receiver's own internal [[map]], or entered manually on the device as a pair of coordinates.

If the GPS receiver has track-logging capabilities, one can also define waypoints after the fact from where one has been. For example, marine GPS receivers often have a "man overboard" function, which instantly creates a waypoint in the receiver for the boat's position when enabled and then begins displaying the distance and course back to that position.

In GPS navigation, a "route" is usually defined as a series of two or more waypoints. To follow such a route, the GPS user navigates to the nearest waypoint, then to the next one in turn until the destination is reached. Most receivers have the ability to compute a [[great circle route]] towards a waypoint, enabling them to find the shortest route even over long distances, although waypoints are often so closely spaced that this is not a factor.

Many GPS receivers, both military and civilian, now offer integrated [[cartography|cartographic]] [[database]]s (also known as ''base maps''), allowing users to locate a point on a map and define it as a waypoint. Some GPS systems intended for automobile navigation can generate a suggested driving route between two waypoints, based on the cartographic database. As one drives along the route, the system indicates the driver's current location and gives advance notice of upcoming turns. The best of these systems can take into account traffic restrictions such as [[one-way street]]s and intersections where left or right turns are prohibited when computing the suggested driving route.

Most GPS receivers allow the user to assign a name to each waypoint. Many models also let the user select a symbol or [[icon (computing)|icon]] to identify the waypoint on a graphical map display from a built-in library of icons. These include standard map symbols for marine navigation aids such as buoys, [[marina]]s and anchorages, as well as land-based [[landmarks]] such as [[church (building)|church]]es, [[bridge]]s, shopping centers, [[park]]s and [[tunnel]]s.

GPS receivers used in air navigation have databases which contain named waypoints, radio navigation aids, airports and heliports. These references comprise the National Airspace System's method of allowing air traffic to select routes that yield efficient point-to-point navigation. Waypoints are often used in the termination phase of a flight to its destination airport. Some GPS receivers are integrated into autopilot or flight management systems, to aid the pilot in control of an aircraft. Waypoints may be found on Aeronautical Charts known as Instrument Flight Rules Enroute Low Altitude Charts, Terminal Arrival Procedures or Sectional Charts.

===Without GPS===
{{See also|Indoor positioning system}}
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
Although the concept of waypoints has been greatly popularized among non-specialists by the development of the GPS, waypoints can be used with other navigational aids. A notable example is the worldwide use, in [[orienteering]] sports, of waypoints with a map that omits a coordinate system, known as [[Control point (orienteering)|control points]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orienteering.ca/about_orienteering.htm |title=About Orienteering |publisher=The Canadian Orienteering Federation |accessdate=2008-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002091244/http://www.orienteering.ca/about_orienteering.htm |archivedate=2008-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In aerial celestial navigation, waypoints are precomputed along an aircraft's [[great circle]] route to divide the flight into [[rhumb lines]] and allow celestial fixes to be more rapidly taken using the precomputed intercept method.

In air navigation, waypoints are sometimes defined as intersections between two VOR radials, or in terms of specific distances and headings towards or away from a radio beacon. For visual air navigation (see the article on [[visual flight rules]]), waypoints may be directly associated with distinctive features on the ground that are easily identifiable from aircraft, such as stadiums, power plants, racetracks, etc. Temporary waypoints are sometimes defined as traffic requires, ''e.g.,'' air-traffic controllers may instruct a pilot to reference a terrain feature at "your ten o'clock position, two miles."

==In aviation==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
In [[aviation]], [[area navigation]] (RNAV)—a method of navigation that permits aircraft operation on any desired flight path within the coverage of station-referenced navigation aids or within the limits of the capability of self-contained aids, or a combination of these—relies heavily upon waypoints. RNAV is increasingly used as the primary method of navigation for aircraft.

In the RNAV context, a waypoint is a predetermined geographical position that is defined in terms of latitude/longitude coordinates (altitude is ignored). Waypoints may be a simple named point in space or may be associated with existing navigational aids, intersections, or fixes. A waypoint is most often used to indicate a change in direction, speed, or altitude along the desired path.

Aviation RNAV procedures make use of both ''fly-over'' and ''fly-by'' waypoints. A fly-over waypoint is a waypoint that must be crossed vertically by an aircraft. A fly-by waypoint is a waypoint that marks the [[intersection (aviation)|intersection]] of two straight paths, with the transition from one path to another being made by the aircraft using a precisely calculated turn that "flies by" but does not vertically cross the waypoint.

Waypoints used in aviation are given five-letter names.  These names are meant to be pronounceable or have a [[mnemonic]] value, so that they may easily be conveyed by voice.  In some cases the names correspond to a notable feature or landmark in the area (for example, a waypoint near [[Newton, Iowa]] has the name "MATAG"; Newton was the birthplace of the appliance manufacturer [[Maytag]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/tech_ops/read.main/58064/|title=Instrument Approach Waypoints - Airliners.net|author=|date=|work=airliners.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SMS==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
Establishing waypoints in real-time and transmitting them via [[GSM]] cellular telephone networks using the [[SMS|Short Message Service]] ([[SMS]]) is referred to as [[GPS2SMS]]. Some vehicles and vessels are equipped with hardware that is able to automatically send an [[SMS]] text message when a particular event happens, such as theft or anchor drift. The receiving party can ring an alert sound or store the waypoint in a computer system or draw a map indicating the location. Recreational use of GPS2SMS is made by travellers who want to show their digital breadcrumbs on a map. See also [[automatic identification system]].

'''Zhou Zhenhe''' ({{zh|s=周振鹤}}; born 1941) is a Chinese [[historical geographer]] and a distinguished senior professor at the Institute of Historical Geography of [[Fudan University]] in Shanghai. His main research interests are cultural and administrative geography and history of Sino-foreign cultural relations. He is the chief editor of the 13-volume ''[[General History of Chinese Administrative Divisions]]'', published between 2007 and 2016.

==Biography==
Zhou was born in [[Xiamen]], [[Fujian]] Province. From 1958 to 1963 he studied at the Department of Mining and Metallurgy of [[Xiamen University]] and then [[Fuzhou University]]. After graduation he worked for many years as an engineer at a coal mine in [[Hunan]] Province.&lt;ref name=whb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.confucianism.com.cn/html/jiaoyu/7467158.html |script-title=zh:记全国首批文科博士周振鹤、葛剑雄教授 |language=Chinese |work=[[Wen Hui Bao]] |date=2 December 2008 |accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iqh&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iqh.net.cn/info.asp?column_id=659 |title=周振鹤简介 |trans-title=Brief Biography of Zhou Zhenhe |publisher=Institute of Qing History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[National Higher Education Entrance Examination]] was restored after the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], Zhou took and excelled in the graduate examination and was admitted to the graduate school of [[Fudan University]] to study historical geography under the famous scholar, academician [[Tan Qixiang]].&lt;ref name=whb/&gt; In 1983, Zhou and his classmate [[Ge Jianxiong]] became the first two recipients of the doctoral degree in humanities (文科博士) in the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref name=whb/&gt;&lt;ref name=iqh/&gt; His Ph.D. dissertation was ''Administrative Geography during the Western Han Dynasty''.&lt;ref name=ikgf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ikgf.uni-erlangen.de/people/index.shtml/zhenhe-zhou.shtml |title=Prof. Dr. Zhenhe Zhou |publisher=International Consortium for Research in the Humanities |accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhou has been a faculty member of the Institute of Historical Geography of Fudan University since 1983, and became a Distinguished Senior Professor in 2008. His main research interests are cultural and administrative geography and history of Sino-foreign cultural relations.&lt;ref name=iqh/&gt; He has also taught as a visiting professor at many universities, including the [[University of Göttingen]] (1998 and 2000), [[Waseda University]] (1999), [[City University of Hong Kong]] (2000, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2011), [[Erlangen University]] (2002), and [[Kansai University]] (2008).&lt;ref name=iqh/&gt;

==Selected publications==
Zhou Zhenhe is the chief editor of ''[[General History of Chinese Administrative Divisions]]'', a 13-volume series covering the history of Chinese administrative divisions from the earliest dynasties ([[Shang dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]]) to the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)]]. It was published by Fudan University Press between 2007 and 2016. It is China's first comprehensive academic history of the country's administrative divisions and was one of the national key publishing projects supported by the [[General Administration of Press and Publication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fudanpress.com/news/showdetail.asp?bookid=11438 |title=中国行政区划通史·秦汉卷 |publisher=Fudan University Press |date=November 2016 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
