The '''A433 road ''' is an [[A road (UK)|A road]] and [[primary route]] in [[Gloucestershire]], England.  It starts at a junction with the [[A46 road|A46]] at [[Dunkirk, Gloucestershire|Dunkirk]] {{nowrap|({{coord|51.5754|-2.3017|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A433 road (western end)}}),}} {{convert|5|mi}} north of junction 18 of the [[M4 Motorway|M4]] and {{convert|4|mi}} northeast of [[Chipping Sodbury]].  It runs northeast for {{convert|16.5|mi}} to a junction with the [[A429 road|A429]] just west of [[Cirencester]] {{nowrap|({{coord|51.7011|-2.0006|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A433 road (eastern end)}}).}} On its way to Cirencester the road passes the spectacular [[Westonbirt Arboretum]], and runs through the villages of [[Westonbirt, Gloucestershire|Westonbirt]] and Doughton, and the town of [[Tetbury]]; then to the north of both [[Cotswold Airport]] (formerly RAF Kemble) and [[Kemble, Gloucestershire|Kemble]] village.

The last {{convert|2|mi}} follow the route of the [[Fosse Way]]. In this section the road passes the ''Thames Head'' pub (named for the [[Thames Head|source of the Thames]]) before rising over a crest and descending into a steep-side cutting to pass under the [[Golden Valley Line]], through a narrow bridge which has no pavement for [[pedestrians]].

== History ==
When the route was first designated in 1922, it finished at a junction with the A429 on the Fosse Way just west of Kemble near Jackaments Bottom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/roadlists/1922.shtml#4 1922 road list]&lt;/ref&gt;  When RAF Kemble was built, circa 1937, the A429 was diverted south of the airfield to follow an upgraded existing road through Kemble village, and the section of the A429 north of the airfield became a continuation of the A433.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=British History Online|title=Victoria County History - Wiltshire - Vol 14 pp51-65 - Parishes: Crudwell|editor-first1=A.P.|editor-last1=Baggs|editor-first2=Jane|editor-last2=Freeman|editor-first3=Janet H|editor-last3=Stvenson|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/wilts/vol14/pp51-65|publisher=University of London|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s or 1940s the route was extended from Cirencester to the [[A40 road|A40]] just west of [[Burford]], on the former route of the [[B4425 road|B4425]].  In the 1980s this section was downgraded to become the B4425 again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/roadlists/r10/notes.php?number=A433 Sabre website: A433]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Angafaru''' is a 404 ha protected area of marine biodiversity encompassing a 200m boundary outside the outer [[Coral reef|reef]] edge of Angafaru, Dhiguthila, Dhonfanu Thila and Mahaanagaa Thila, in the [[Maldives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.broffice.gov.mv/en/index.php/protected-areas/35-angafaru-region|title=Angafaru Region|last=|first=|date=|website=BAA ATOLL UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Maldives|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site has rich biodiversity, being habitat for green and [[hawksbill turtle]]s, [[grouper]]s, clams, [[sea cucumber]]s and bait fish. During some periods of the year, [[dolphin]]s, [[whale shark]]s and [[manta ray]]s can be observed. The area also has manta ray "[[cleaning stations]]". In parts of Angafaru, the reef has a very large diversity of corals.
 
The name of the atoll is South Maalhosmadulu Atoll, southwest of [[Kihaadhoo (Baa Atoll)|Kihaadhoo]] island.

The location is: 1. 5 10’ 58.18"N, 73 07’ 46.53"E / 2. 5 11’ 03.33"N, 73 08’ 46.54"E / 3. 5 10’ 33.64"N, 73 09’ 40.81"E

The area was declared protected on 5 June 2009. The directive number was 138-EE/2009/19. The management authorities were the MHTE and the EPA.

[[Image:Antarctic circle.svg|thumb|350px|''Map of the [[Antarctic]] with the Antarctic Circle in blue.'']]
The '''Antarctic Circle''' is the most southerly of the five major [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]] that mark maps of the [[Earth]]. The region south of this circle is known as the [[Antarctic]], and the zone immediately to the north is called the [[Geographical zone#Temperate Zones|Southern Temperate Zone]]. South of the Antarctic Circle, the [[sun]] is above the [[horizon]] for 24 continuous [[hour]]s at least once per year (and therefore visible at [[midnight]]) and the centre of the sun is below the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore not visible at [[noon]]); this is also true within the equivalent [[polar circle]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the [[Arctic Circle]].

The position of the Antarctic Circle is not fixed; as of {{TODAY}}, it runs {{circle of latitude|polar}} south of the [[Equator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neoprogrammics.com/obliquity_of_the_ecliptic/ |title=Obliquity of the Ecliptic (Eps Mean) |publisher=Neoprogrammics.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its latitude depends on the Earth's [[axial tilt]], which fluctuates within a margin of more than 2° over a 41,000-year period, due to [[tidal force]]s resulting from the [[orbit of the Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berger |first=A.L. |date=1976 |title=Obliquity and Precession for the Last 5000000 Years |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |volume=51 |issue= |pages=127–135 |bibcode=1976A&amp;A....51..127B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the Antarctic Circle is currently [[circle of latitude#Movement of the Tropical and Polar Circles|drifting southwards]] at a speed of about {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}} per year.

==Midnight sun and polar night==
[[File:axial_tilt_vs_tropical_and_polar_circles.svg|thumb|400px|Relationship of Earth's axial tilt (&amp;#949;) to the tropical and polar circles]]
{{Further|Midnight sun|Polar night}}
The Antarctic Circle is the northernmost latitude in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] at which the centre of the sun can remain continuously above the horizon for twenty-four hours; as a result, at least once each year at any location within the Antarctic Circle the centre of the sun is [[Midnight sun|visible at local midnight]], and at least once the centre of the sun is obscured at local noon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burn|first=Chris|title=The Polar Night|url=http://nwtresearch.com/sites/default/files/the-polar-night.pdf|publisher=The Aurora Research Institute|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NB: This refers to the true geometric centre which actually appears higher in the sky because of refraction by the atmosphere.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Directly on the Antarctic Circle these events occur, in principle, exactly once per year: at the [[December solstice|December]] and [[June solstice|June]] [[solstice]]s, respectively. However, because of [[atmospheric refraction]] and [[mirage]]s, and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point, part of the midnight sun may be seen on the night of the southern [[summer solstice]] up to about 50 [[Minute and second of arc|minutes (′)]] ({{convert|90|km|abbr=on}}) north of the Antarctic Circle; similarly, on the day of the southern [[winter solstice]], part of the sun may be seen up to about 50′ south of the Antarctic Circle. That is true at sea level; those limits increase with elevation above sea level, although in mountainous regions there is often no direct view of the true horizon. Mirages on the Antarctic continent tend to be even more spectacular than in Arctic regions, creating, for example, a series of apparent sunsets and sunrises while in reality the sun remains under the horizon.

==Human habitation==
[[File:Antarctic Circle Icberg.JPG|thumb|An [[iceberg]] near the Antarctic Circle north of [[Detaille Island]]]]
{{Further|Demographics of Antarctica}}
There is no permanent human population south of the Antarctic Circle, but there are several [[research stations in Antarctica]] operated by various nations that are inhabited by teams of scientists who rotate on a seasonal basis. In previous centuries some semi-permanent [[whaling]] stations were established on the continent, and some whalers would live there for a year or more. At least three children have been born in Antarctica, albeit in stations north of the Antarctic Circle.

==Geography==
{{kml}}
The Antarctic Circle is roughly {{Convert|17662|km|mi}} long.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/ks3/geography/geographical_enquiry/geographical_skills/revision/6/ BBC website, accessed Jan 3, 2016 ]''&lt;/ref&gt; The area south of the Circle is about {{Convert|20000000|km2|abbr=on}} and covers roughly 4% of Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = William M. Marsh| author2 = Martin M. Kaufman| title = Physical Geography: Great Systems and Global Environments| url = https://books.google.com/?id=uF3aJSC20yMC&amp;pg=PA24| year = 2012| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-76428-5| page = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[continent]] of [[Antarctica]] covers much of the area within the Antarctic Circle.

'''Archeogeography''' is an academic discipline that deals with the dynamics of [[space]] over time and helps to explore other dimensions of [[Historical geography|geohistorical]] objects that have been made so far by the disciplines of historical geography, the geo-history and [[archaeology]] of the landscape or the environment.

'''Aukštojas Hill''' is the highest point in all of [[Lithuania]]; it is located in the [[Medininkai]] Highlands, Migūnai forestry, approximately {{convert|24|km|mi}} southeast of the capital city of [[Vilnius]]. Its elevation was measured in 2004 at 293.84 metres (964.08&amp;nbsp;feet) by specialists at the Institute of Geodesy at [[Vilnius Gediminas Technical University]], using [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] technology. Previously, [[Juozapinė Hill]], at 292.7 metres (960.35&amp;nbsp;feet), had been officially regarded as the highest point in [[Lithuania]]. In 1985, suspicions were raised by Rimantas Krupickas, a Lithuanian geographer, that [[Juozapinė Hill]] was not actually [[Lithuania]]'s highest elevation. Aukštojas Hill is located approximately 500 metres (1,640 feet) west of [[Juozapinė Hill]].

The designated use of the land where Aukštojas Hill is situated has been changed by the Vilnius county governor from agricultural to tourism and cultural. The summit of the hill features a grove  of pine trees. The public institution 'Lietuvos viršūnės', headed by [[Vladas Vitkauskas]], Lithuania's leading mountaineer, is pursuing efforts to designate Aukštojas Hill as a geographic landmark in the historically important Medininkai region.

The name 'Aukštojas' was suggested by Libertas Klimka, a professor of history at the [[Vilnius Pedagogical University]], and was the winner of a contest to decide the best name for the newly discovered elevation. Aukštėjas (Aukštojas, Aukštujis) was one of the most important deities in ancient [[Lithuanian mythology]]; he was considered the creator of the world. The hill was 'baptised' on June 20, 2005, during an unofficial ceremony. The name was officially approved by the [[Vilnius city municipality|Vilnius Region Municipality Council]] on November 18, 2005.

An alternate name, 'Aukštėjas Hill', was discarded as a nominee by the [[Commission of the Lithuanian Language|State Commission on the Lithuanian language]], on the grounds that its suffix ("-ėj-") was not standard usage for a place-name; 'Aukštėjas' has been approved by the commission only as a name for the deity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7570">'''C-squares''' (acronym for the '''''concise spatial query and representation system''''') is a system of [[geocode]]s (actually a type of [[Grid (spatial index)|global grid]]) that provides a basis for simple [[spatial index]]ing of geographic features or data. It was devised by Tony Rees of [[CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research]] (then "CSIRO Marine Research") in 2001-2, and described in the literature in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marine.csiro.au/csquares/csq-article-Mar03-lowres.pdf Rees, T. 2003. “C-squares”, a new spatial indexing system and its applicability to the description of oceanographic datasets. Oceanography, 16(1), 11–19.]&lt;/ref&gt; The notation system of c-squares incorporates a compact encoding of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] coordinates into a machine- and [[human-readable]] ''c-squares code'', which can then be used either for spatial search or display via a suitable mapping application. The c-squares codes also provide an application- and vendor-independent, interoperable notation system for any gridded data whose units of organization correspond with steps of the c-squares hierarchy (e.g. 5-, 1-, 0.5 degree cells, etc.).

==Rationale==
According to the initial system description, c-squares was devised as an improved (more precise) method for expressing dataset geographic extents in searchable [[geospatial metadata|metadata]] catalogues, in place of (or in addition to) conventional [[minimum bounding rectangle|bounding rectangle]] representations. The method is also useful as a generic, interoperable notation for gridded data (see above), for example a variety of datasets that describe environmental characteristics of global half-degree cells (see [http://www.aquamaps.org/ AquaMaps] site). C-squares can also simply be used for mapping (example: [http://www.marine.csiro.au/caab CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research's "CAAB" application]), although the most value is obtained when the system is used for spatial search as well (e.g. [http://www.iobis.org/ OBIS database], [http://www.cmar.csiro.au/marlin CMAR's "MarLIN" metadatabase], etc.).

==Description==
C-squares provides a hierarchical nomenclature for dividing 10°x10° [[World Meteorological Organization squares|World Meteorological Organization (WMO) squares]] into smaller units (each an individual "c-square") of 5°x5°, 1°x1°, 0.5°x0.5°, 0.1°x0.1°, etc., using an alternating base 2, base 5 linear division, as fine as may be required. Each cell of the resulting subdivision is allocated a unique alphanumeric identifier (c-squares code), such that the position of an object or objects on the surface of the [[Globe]] can be represented by a set of one or more such codes that define the cell(s) within which the object occurs. Storing these codes as text identifiers, for example in a [[database]], repository of [[Geospatial metadata|spatial metadata]], searchable text file or web page, then offers the functionality for a simple, text-based spatial search, without the requirement for any more complex [[geographic information system]] (GIS). Once stored (or if desired, generated on-the-fly using a c-squares encoder), a code or set of codes can also be rendered on a map by a utility (for example, the web-accessible [http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/about-mapper.htm c-squares&amp;nbsp;mapper]) that incorporates the relevant decoding routines.

The actual assignment of the individual cell identifiers to vector objects whose position is expressed in latitude, longitude coordinates follows rules described in reference (1) and the [http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/ c-squares website] and can be automated via simple routines, and the reverse is also possible (decoding) in a straightforward manner. In addition, since the codes are hierarchical and interleaved (each "cycle" containing identifiers for both longitude and latitude, at progressively finer levels of resolution), only the relevant "leading" portion of a (for example) high resolution code need be interrogated to match a lower resolution spatial query.

Conceptually, the c-squares encoding method belongs to a class of algorithms which can be considered derivations of the [[Z-order (curve)|Z-order]] principle.

==Example c-squares codes==
[[London]], UK, occupies (for example) portions of four 0.5°x0.5° cells:
* -0.5°W to 0°W, 51.5°N to 52.0°N
* -0.5°W to 0°W, 51.0°N to 51.5°N
* 0°E to 0.5°E, 51.5°N to 52.0°N
* 0°E to 0.5°E, 51.0°N to 51.5°N

In c-squares notation these are cells ''7500:110:3'', ''7500:110:1'', ''1500:110:3'' and ''1500:110:1'' (at 0.5°x0.5° resolution). Alternatively at 1°x1° they are portions of two cells, ''7500:110'' and ''1500:110''; at 5°x5° resolution, portions of two cells ''7500:1'' and ''1500:1''; and at 10°x10° resolution, portions of 2 cells ''7500'' and ''1500'' (equivalent to the same identifiers as in [[World Meteorological Organization squares|WMO squares]]).

To visualize the position of these squares on a map, the current syntax to address an installation of the "c-squares mapper" is (e.g.):

[http://www.obis.org.au/cgi-bin/cs_map.pl?csq=7500:110:3|7500:110:1|1500:110:3|1500:110:1 http://www.obis.org.au/cgi-bin/cs_map.pl?csq=7500:110:3|7500:110:1|1500:110:3|1500:110:1].

In a system that uses c-squares codes as units of spatial indexing, a text-based search on any of these square identifiers will retrieve data associated with the relevant square. If a wildcard search is supported (for example suppose that the wildcard character is a percent sign), a search on "7500%" will retrieve all data items in that ten degree square, a search on "7500:1%" will retrieve all data items in that five degree square, etc.

The asterisk character "*" has a special (reserved) meaning in c-squares notation, being a "compact" notation indicating that all finer cells within a higher level cell are included, to the level of resolution indicated by the number of asterisks. In the example above, "7500:*" would indicate that all 4 five-degree cells within parent ten-degree cell "7500" are filled, "7500:***" would indicate that all 100 one-degree cells within parent ten-degree cell "7500" are filled, etc. This approach enables the filling of contiguous blocks of cells with an economy of characters in many cases (a form of [[data compression]]), that is useful for efficient storage and transfer of c-squares codes as required.

==Sample c-squares enabled systems==
C-squares spatial indexing, search, and/or mapping routines are currently incorporated into OBIS, the [[Ocean Biogeographic Information System]]; [[FishBase]]; [[AquaMaps]]; and a variety of web-accessible applications at [[CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research]]. For a full list, see the link [http://www.marine.csiro.au/csquares/samples.htm Sample c-squares enabled systems] on the c-squares website.

[[Image:Community garden in Ottawa.jpg|thumb|300px|Strathcona Heights Community Garden in [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]].]]

A '''community garden''' is a single piece of land [[gardening | garden]]ed [[collective]]ly by a group of people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communitygarden.org/learn/ ''What is a community garden?''] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071204082111/http://www.communitygarden.org/learn/ |date= 2007-12-04 }}; American Community Garden Association; 2007; accessed on 2007-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Community gardens utilize either individual or shared plots on private or public land while producing fruit, vegetables, and/or plants grown for their attractive appearance.

==Purpose==
[[File:South Central Farm 6.jpg|thumb|Crops at the former [[South Central Farm]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States]]]]

According to Marin Master Gardeners, "a community garden is any piece of land gardened by a group of people, utilizing either individual or shared plots on private or public land".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://ucanr.edu/sites/MarinMG/Great_Gardening_Information/Marin_Community_Gardens/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510091024/http://ucanr.edu/sites/MarinMG/Great_Gardening_Information/Marin_Community_Gardens/|archivedate=10 May 2016|publisher=University of California|title=Community Gardens|author=Marin Master Gardeners}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community gardens provide fresh products and plants as well as contributing to a sense of community and connection to the environment and an opportunity for satisfying labor and neighborhood improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hannah | first1 = A.K. | last2 = Oh | first2 = P. | year = 2000 | title = Rethinking Urban Poverty: A look at Community Gardens | url = | journal = Bulletin of Science, Technology and &amp; Society | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 207–216 | doi=10.1177/027046760002000308}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are publicly functioning in terms of ownership, access, and management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferris | first1 = J. | last2 = Norman | first2 = C. | last3 = Sempik | first3 = J. | year = 2001 | title = People, Land and Sustainability: Community Gardens and the Social Dimension of Sustainable Development | url = | journal = Social Policy and Administration | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 559–568 | doi=10.1111/1467-9515.t01-1-00253}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as typically owned in trust by local governments or not for profit associations.

Community gardens vary widely throughout the world. In North America, community gardens range from familiar "[[victory garden]]" areas where people grow small plots of vegetables, to large "greening" projects to preserve natural areas, to tiny street beautification planters on urban street corners. Some grow only flowers, others are nurtured communally and their bounty shared. There are even non-profits in many major cities that offer assistance to low-income families, children groups, and community organizations by helping them develop and grow their own gardens. In the UK and the rest of Europe, closely related "[[allotment gardens]]" can have dozens of plots, each measuring hundreds of square meters and rented by the same family for generations. In the developing world, commonly held land for small gardens is a familiar part of the landscape, even in urban areas, where they may function as [[market garden]]s. They also practice crop rotations with versatile plants such as peanuts, [[tomatoes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tomatoes Secrets|url=https://totallytomatoes.net/the-versatile-totally-tomatoes-fruit|accessdate=6 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117010208/http://totallytomatoes.net/the-versatile-totally-tomatoes-fruit|archivedate=17 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much more.

Community gardens are often used in urban neighborhoods to alleviate the food desert effect.  Food accessibility described in urban areas refers to residents who have limited access to fresh produce such as fruits and vegetables.  [[Food desert]]s often serve lower-income neighborhoods usually in which residents are forced to rely on unhealthy food options such as expensive processed foods from convenience stores, gas stations, and fast-food restaurants.  Community gardens provide accessibility for fresh food to be in closer proximity located in local neighborhoods.  Community gardens can help expand the realm for ensuring residents’ access to healthy and affordable food in a community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://environment.yale.edu/yer/article/oases-in-the-urban-food-desert#gsc.tab=0|title=Oases in the urban ‘food desert’? {{!}} Yale Environment Review|website=environment.yale.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community gardens may help alleviate one effect of climate change, which is expected to cause a global decline in agricultural output, making fresh produce increasingly unaffordable.&lt;ref name="autogenerated24"&gt;Harris, E (2009). "The role of community gardens in creating healthy communities", Australian Planner, v. 46, no. 2 (June 2009) pp. 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Community gardens are also an increasingly popular method of changing the built environment in order to promote health and wellness in the face of urbanization. The built environment has a wide range of positive and negative effects on the people who work, live, and play in a given area, including a person's chance of developing obesity &lt;ref&gt;Xu, Y., &amp; Wang, F. (2015). Built environment and obesity by urbanicity in the U.S. Health &amp; Place, 34, 19-29..&lt;/ref&gt; Community gardens encourage an urban community's [[food security]], allowing citizens to grow their own food or for others to donate what they have grown.&lt;ref name="autogenerated24"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Toni|date=1 November 1996|title=Closing the nutrient loop: Using urban agriculture to increase food supply and reduce waste|journal=World Watch|volume=9|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Closing+the+nutrient+loop.-a019034365| pages=10–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates say locally grown food decreases a community's reliance on fossil fuels for transport of food from large agricultural areas and reduces a society's overall use of fossil fuels to drive in agricultural machinery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/opinion/ci_14687546]: Kishler, Les. Opinion: community gardens are a serious answer to food supplies, health (2010, March 18) ''San Jose Mercury News''.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 op-ed by community garden advocate Les Kishler examines how community gardening can reinforce the so-called "positive" ideas and activities of the [[Occupy movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationofchange.org/occupy-community-gardens-1328107081 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414010232/http://www.nationofchange.org/occupy-community-gardens-1328107081 |archivedate=2012-04-14 |df= }}: Kishler, Les. Occupy Community Gardens (2012, February 12) ''Nation of Change''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Community gardens improve users’ health through increased fresh vegetable consumption and providing a venue for exercise.&lt;ref name="autogenerated24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WellbeingMay2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lean and green|url=http://www.wellbeing.com.au/newsdetail/Lean-and-green_000916|accessdate=7 May 2013|date=1 May 2013|publisher=Wellbeing.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental part of good health is a diet rich in fresh fruits, vegetables, and other plant based foods.&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, L., Igbinedion, E., Thorogood, M., Clarke, A., Stranges, S., Hooper, L., &amp; Rees, K. (2012). Increased consumption of fruit and vegetables for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. ''Protocols Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.''
&lt;/ref&gt; Community gardens provide access to such foods for the communities in which they are located. Community gardens are especially important in communities with large concentrations of low socioeconomic populations, as a lack fresh fruit and vegetable availability plagues these communities at disproportionate rates.&lt;ref name="Obesity 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = D. | last2 = Jaenicke | first2 = E. C. | last3 = Volpe | first3 = R.

The gardens also combat two forms of alienation that plague modern urban life, by bringing urban gardeners closer in touch with the source of their food, and by breaking down isolation by creating a social community. Community gardens provide other social benefits, such as the sharing of food production knowledge with the wider community and safer living spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, E (2009).

Land for a community garden can be publicly or privately held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://homes.ninemsn.com.au/2015/11/20/14/47/start-a-community-garden|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120221228/http://homes.ninemsn.com.au/2015/11/20/14/47/start-a-community-garden|archivedate=20 November 2015|first=Tricia|last=Hogbin|title=How to start a community garden|date=20 November 2015|website=NineMSN}}&lt;/ref&gt; One strong tradition in North American community gardening in urban areas is cleaning up abandoned vacant lots and turning them into productive gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140924/astoria/how-you-can-turn-new-york-citys-vacant-lots-into-community-gardens|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921092144/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140924/astoria/how-you-can-turn-new-york-citys-vacant-lots-into-community-gardens|archivedate=21 September 2015|title=How You Can Turn New York City's Vacant Lots into Community Gardens |first=Jeanmarie|last=Evelly|date=24 September 2014|publisher=DNAinfo New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, community gardens can be seen as a health or recreational amenity and included in public parks, similar to ball fields or playgrounds. Historically, community gardens have also served to provide food during wartime or periods of economic depression. Access to land and security of land tenure remains a major challenge for community gardeners and their supporters throughout the world, since in most cases the gardeners themselves do not own or control the land directly.&lt;ref&gt;''Visionaries and planners : the garden city movement and the modern community'', Stanley Buder. New York: Oxford University Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-19-506174-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some gardens are grown collectively, with everyone working together; others are split into clearly divided plots, each managed by a different gardener (or group or family). Many community gardens have both "common areas" with shared upkeep and individual/family plots. Though communal areas are successful in some cases, in others there is a [[tragedy of the commons]], which results in uneven workload on participants, and sometimes demoralization, neglect, and abandonment of the communal model. Some relate this to the largely unsuccessful history of [[collective farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=NPR|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2012/03/20/148999066/at-the-community-garden-its-community-thats-the-hard-part|title=At The Community Garden, It's Community That's The Hard Part|date=20 March 2012 |accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[public parks]], whether community gardens are open to the general public is dependent upon the lease agreements with the management body of the park and the community garden membership. Open or closed-gate policies vary from garden to garden. However, in a key difference, community gardens are managed and maintained with the active participation of the gardeners themselves, rather than tended only by a professional staff. A second difference is food production: Unlike parks, where plantings are ornamental (or more recently ecological), community gardens often encourage food production by providing gardeners a place to grow vegetables and other crops. To facilitate this, a community garden may be divided into individual plots or tended in a communal fashion, depending on the size and quality of a garden and the members involved.&lt;ref&gt;''Selected factors influencing the success of a community garden'', by Gordon Arthur Clark. Kansas State University, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of gardens ===
There are multiple types of community gardens with distinct varieties in which the community can participate in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marinmg.ucanr.edu/Great_Gardening_Information/Marin_Community_Gardens/|title=Community Gardens|last=Resources|first=University of California, Division of Agriculture and Natural|website=marinmg.ucanr.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Neighborhood gardens''' are the most common type that is normally defined as a garden where a group of people come together to grow fruits, vegetables and ornamentals. They are identifiable as a parcel of private or public land where individual plots are rented by gardeners at a nominal annual fee. 
* '''Residential Gardens''' are typically shared among residents in apartment communities, assisted living, and affordable housing units. These gardens are organized and maintained by residents living on the premise.
* '''Institutional Gardens '''are attached to either public or private organizations and offer numerous beneficial services for residents.  Benefits include mental or physical rehabilitation and therapy, as well as teaching a set of skills for job-related placement.
* '''Demonstration Gardens''' are used for educational and recreational purposes in mind. They often offer short seminars or presentations about gardening, and provide the necessary tools to operate a community garden.

In Britain, the 1922 Allotment act specifies "an allotment not exceeding 40 [square] [[Rod (unit)|pole]]s in extent"; since a rod, pole or perch is 5.5 yards in length, 40 square rods is 1210 square yards or 10890 square feet (equivalent to a large plot of 90&amp;nbsp;ft x 121&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Allotments: a plotholder's guide|url=http://ari.farmgarden.org.uk/documents/Other_ARI_publications/plotholdersguide.pdf|accessdate=18 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518235754/http://ari.farmgarden.org.uk/documents/Other_ARI_publications/plotholdersguide.pdf|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, plot sizes vary; Lewisham offers plots with an "average size" of "125 metres square".{{efn|This apparently means 125m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or about 1345 square feet, equivalent to a plot of about 15ft x 90ft.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Allotments and community gardens|url=http://www.lewisham.gov.uk/inmyarea/openspaces/Pages/allotments.aspx|publisher=Lewisham Borough Council|accessdate=18 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510052302/http://www.lewisham.gov.uk/inmyarea/openspaces/Pages/allotments.aspx|archivedate=10 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Two national surveys sponsored by the American Community Gardening Association in the late 1980s and mid-1990s, and other research, suggest there is no "standard" community garden plot size in the United States and Canada. {{citation needed}}--&gt;In America, plots vary; for example, plots of 3m × 6m (10&amp;nbsp;ft × 20&amp;nbsp;ft = 200 square feet) and 3m x 4.5m (10&amp;nbsp;ft x 15&amp;nbsp;ft) are listed in [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Parks and Recreation: Community Gardens |url=http://www.muni.org/departments/parks/pages/gardenplots.aspx |publisher=Municipality of Anchorage |accessdate=18 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524062830/http://www.muni.org/Departments/parks/Pages/GardenPlots.aspx |archivedate=24 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Montgomery Parks in [[Maryland]] lists plots of 200, 300, 400 and 625 square feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Community Gardens Program |url=http://www.montgomeryparks.org/permits/find/community_gardens_program.shtm |publisher=Montgomery Parks, Maryland |accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Canada, plots of 20x20 and 10x10 feet, as well as smaller "raised beds", are listed in [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Gardens|url=http://www.cityofvancouver.us/parksrec/page/community-gardens#Garden%20Plot%20Rates|publisher=City of Vancouver|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location===
Community gardens may be found in neighborhoods, schools, hospitals, and on residential housing grounds. The location of a community garden is a critical factor in how often the community garden is used and who visits it. Exposure to a community garden is much more likely for an individual if they are able to walk or drive to the location, as opposed to public transportation.&lt;ref name=Blaine&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.joe.org/joe/2010december/a6.php|title=Profiling Community Gardeners|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505184513/http://www.joe.org/joe/2010december/a6.php|archivedate=5 May 2016|date=December 2010|volume=48|issue=6|first1=Thomas W.|last1=Blaine|first2=Parwinder S.|last2=Grewal|first3=Ashley|last3=Dawes|first4=Darrin|last4=Snider}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of travel time is also a factor. Those who live within a 15-minute or less travel distance are more likely to visit a community garden as compared to those with a longer travel time.&lt;ref name=Blaine/&gt; Such statistics should be taken into consideration when choosing a location for a community garden for a target population.

===Plant choice and physical layout===
While food production is central to many community and allotment gardens, not all have vegetables as a main focus. Restoration of natural areas and native plant gardens are also popular, as are "art" gardens. Many gardens have several different planting elements, and combine plots with such projects as small orchards, herbs and butterfly gardens. Individual plots can become "virtual" backyards, each highly diverse, creating a "quilt" of flowers, vegetables and folk art.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Raised beds are sometimes used to separate plants from surrounding natural plants or to improve ease of access, especially for disabled gardeners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/so05/indepth/urban.asp Urban preservation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627174203/http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/SO05/indepth/urban.asp |date=2006-06-27 }}: How greening small spaces can strengthen community roots in [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group and leadership selection===
The community gardening movement in North American prides itself on being inclusive, diverse, pro-democracy, and supportive of community involvement. Gardeners may be of any cultural background, young or old, new gardeners or seasoned growers, rich or poor. A garden may have only a few people active, or hundreds.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Some community gardens “self-support” through membership dues, and others require a sponsor for tools, seeds, or money donations. Churches, schools, private businesses or parks and recreation departments supporters and community leaders.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://communitygarden.org/mission/|title=Growing Community Across the U.S. and Canada - American Community Garden Association|last=|first=|date=|work=American Community Garden Association|access-date=2017-05-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, all community gardens have a structure. The organization depends in part on whether the garden is "top down" or "grassroots". There are many different organizational models in use for community gardens. Some elect boards in a democratic fashion, while others can be run by appointed officials. Some are managed by [[non-profit organization]]s, such as a community gardening association, a community association, a church, or other land-owner; others by a city's recreation or parks department, a school or University.

Gardeners may form a grassroots group to initiate the garden, such as the Green Guerrillas of New York City,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenguerillas.org Green Guerillas]&lt;/ref&gt; or a garden may be organized "top down" by a municipal agency. The Los Gatos, California-based non-profit Community Gardens as Appleseeds&lt;ref&gt;[http://communitygardensasappleseeds.info Community Gardens as Appleseeds]&lt;/ref&gt; offers free assistance in starting up new community gardens around the world.

===Membership rules and fees===
In most cases, gardeners are expected to pay annual dues to help with garden upkeep, and the organization must manage these fees. The tasks in a community garden are many, including upkeep, mulching paths, recruiting members, and fund raising. Rules and an 'operations manual' are both invaluable tools, and ideas for both are available at the ACGA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communitygarden.org American Community Gardening Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health effects of community gardens===
Community gardens have been shown to have positive health effects on those who participate in the programs, particularly in the areas of decreasing body mass index and lower rates of obesity. Studies have found that community gardens in schools have been found to improve average body mass index in children. A 2013 study found that 17% of obese or overweight children improved their body mass index over seven weeks.&lt;ref name=Castro&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Castro | first1 = DC | last2 = Samuels | first2 = M | last3 = Harman | first3 = AE | year = 2013 | title = Growing healthy kids: a community garden-based obesity prevention program | doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2012.11.024 | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 44 | issue = 3 Suppl 3| pages = S193–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Obesity 2016"/&gt; Specifically, 13% of the obese children achieved a lower body mass index in the overweight range, while 23% of overweight children achieved a normal body mass index.&lt;ref name=Castro/&gt; Many studies have been performed largely in low-income, Hispanic/Latino communities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = JN | last2 = Ventura | first2 = EE | last3 = Cook | first3 = LT | last4 = Gyllenhammer | first4 = LE | last5 = Gatto | first5 = NM | date = August 2011 | title = LA Sprouts: a gardening, nutrition, and cooking intervention for Latino youth improves diet and reduces obesity | url = | journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 111 | issue = 8| pages = 1224–30 | doi = 10.1016/j.jada.2011.05.009 | pmid=21802571}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these programs, gardening lessons were accompanied by nutrition and cooking classes and optional parent engagement. Successful programs highlighted the necessity of culturally tailored programming.

There is some evidence to suggest that community gardens have a similar effect in adults. A study found that community gardeners in Utah had a lower body mass index than their non-gardening siblings and unrelated neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zick | first1 = CD | last2 = Smith | first2 = KR | last3 = Kowaleski-Jones | first3 = L | last4 = Uno | first4 = C | last5 = Merrill | first5 = BJ | date = June 2013 | title = Harvesting more than vegetables: the potential weight control benefits of community gardening | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 103 | issue = 6| pages = 1110–5 | doi=10.2105/ajph.2012.301009 | pmid=23597347 | pmc=3698715}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative records were used to compare body mass indexes of community gardeners to that of unrelated neighbors, siblings, and spouses. Gardeners were less likely to be overweight or obese than their neighbors, and gardeners had lower body mass indexes than their siblings. However, there was no difference in body mass index between gardeners and their spouses which may suggest that community gardening creates healthy habits for the entire household.

Participation in a community garden has been shown to increase both availability and consumption of fruits and vegetables in households. A study showed an average increase in availability of 2.55 fruits and 4.3 vegetables with participation in a community garden. It also showed that children in participating households consumed an average of two additional servings per week of fruits and 4.9 additional servings per week of vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://salud-america.org/sites/salud-america/files/grantee-research/castro2011.pdf|title=Salud America!

===Policy implications===

There is strong support among American adults for local and state policies and policy changes that support community gardens. A study found that 47.2% of American adults supported such policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |pmid=22898158 |title=Support among U.S. adults for local and state policies to increase fruit and vegetable access |first1=JL |last1=Foltz |first2=DM |last2=Harris |first3=Blanck |last3=HM |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2012.05.017 |volume=43 |year=2012 |journal=Am J Prev Med |pages=S102–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, community gardens compete with the interests of developers. {{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Community gardens are largely impacted and governed by policies at the city level. In particular, zoning laws strongly impact the possibility of community gardens. The momentum for rezoning often comes from the public need for access to fruits and vegetables. Rezoning is necessary in many cities for a parcel of land to be designated a community garden, but rezoning doesn’t guarantee garden will not be developed in the future.

Further policies can be enacted to protect community gardens from future development. For example, New York State reached a settlement in 2002 which protected hundreds of community gardens which had been established by the Parks and Recreation Department GreenThumb Program from future development.&lt;ref&gt;
Robert Fox Elder. (2005). protecting new york city's community gardens. New York University Environmental Law Journal, 13, 769-803.&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, zoning policy lags behind the development of community gardens. In these cases, community gardens may exist illegally. Such was the case in Detroit when hundreds of community gardens were created in abandoned spaces around the city. The city of Detroit created agricultural zones in 2013 in the middle of urban areas to legitimize the over 355 “illegal” community gardens.&lt;ref&gt;Kaffer, N. (2010). Planners recommend new zoning, lower tax rate for urban farms. Crain's Detroit Business, 26(13), 8. 91 U. Det. Mercy L. Rev. 345. Retrieved from www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[File:Community_Garden,_Melbourne,_Australia.jpg|thumb|Community Garden, Melbourne, Australia]]
The first Australian community garden was established in 1977 in [[Nunawading, Victoria]] followed soon after by Ringwood Community Garden&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ringwoodcommunitygarden.org.au | title=Ringwood Community Garden | accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in March 1980.&lt;ref name=Australia[ACTGov]&gt;{{cite web|title=A Study of the Demand for Community Gardens and their Benefits for the ACT Community|url=http://www.actpla.act.gov.au/tools_resources/research_based_planning_for_a_better_city/demand_for_community_gardens_and_their_benefits|publisher=ACT Government|accessdate=14 April 2013|author=Environment and Sustainable Development Directorate|date=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
[[File:Foto familia huertos comunitario.JPG|thumb|right|400px|The [[squatting|squatted]] [[social center]] [[Can Masdeu]] is home to one of the largest community gardens in Barcelona.]] Most older Spaniards grew up in the countryside and moved to the city to find work. Strong family ties often keep them from retiring to the countryside, and so urban community gardens are in great demand. [[Potluck]]s and [[paella]]s are common, as well as regular meetings to manage the affairs of the garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbangardensbarcelona.wordpress.com/ |title=Urban Gardens |publisher=Urbangardensbarcelona.wordpress.com |date=25 November 2009 |accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], community gardening is generally distinct from allotment gardening, though the distinction is sometimes blurred. Allotments are generally plots of land rented to individuals for their cultivation by local authorities or other public bodies—the upkeep of the land is usually the responsibility of the individual plot owners. Allotments tend (but not invariably) to be situated around the outskirts of built-up areas. Use of allotment areas as open space or play areas is generally discouraged. However, there are an increasing number of community-managed allotments, which may include allotment plots and a community garden area, many of them overseen by the Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens (a registered charity).&lt;ref name=aboutFCFCG&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.farmgarden.org.uk/about-us | title=About FCFCG | publisher=Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens | accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community garden movement is of more recent provenance than allotment gardening, with many such gardens built on patches of derelict land, waste ground or land owned by the local authority or a private landlord that is not being used for any purpose. A community garden in the United Kingdom tends to be situated in a built-up area and is typically run by people from the local community as an independent, non-profit organisation (though this may be wholly or partly funded by public money).{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} For example, Norwich's Fifth Quarter Community Garden.

It is also likely to perform a dual function as an open space or play area (in which role it may also be known as a 'city park') and—while it may offer plots to individual cultivators—the organisation that administers the garden will normally have a great deal of the responsibility for its planting, landscaping and upkeep. An example inner-city garden of this sort is [[Islington]]'s Culpeper Community Garden, which is a registered charity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.culpeper.org.uk/ | title=Culpeper Community Garden: Islington's Green Oasis | accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Camden Town|Camden]]'s [[Phoenix Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thephoenixgarden.org/ | title=The Phoenix Garden | accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taiwan===
There is an extensive network of community gardens and collective urban farms in Taipei City often occupying areas of the city that are waiting for development. Flood-prone river banks and other areas unsuitable for urban construction often become legal or illegal community gardens. The network of the community gardens of Taipei are referred to as ''[[Urban Acupuncture|Taipei organic acupuncture]]'' of the industrial city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/the-community-gardens-of-taipei/2010/12/04 "The Community Gardens of Taipei"] Casagrande, Marco (2010). ''P2P Foundation''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mali===
Often externally supported, community gardens become increasingly important in developing countries, such as West African [[Mali]] to bridge the gap between supply and requirements for micro-nutrients and at the same time strengthen an inclusive development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0168-ssoar-325187 Hans-Heinrich Bass, Klaus von Freyhold und Cordula Weisskoeppel: Water harvesting, tree protection: towards food security in the Sahel, Bremen 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''constituent state''' is a territorial and [[constitution]]al entity forming [[Administrative division|part]] of a [[sovereign state]]. A constituent state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory and is a form of [[regional government]].

==Federated entities==
{{Main|Federated state}}

Constituent states united in a [[federation|federal union]] under a [[federal government]] are more specifically known as federated states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forumfed.org/en/products/magazine/vol8_num2/overview-dependency.php Constituent Units Risk Lengthy Dependency on Federal Aid] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218004657/http://www.forumfed.org/en/products/magazine/vol8_num2/overview-dependency.php |date=2010-12-18 }}.

==Within a federacy==
{{further|Autonomous area|Associated state}}

[[Administrative division|Administrative units]] that are not federated but enjoy a greater degree of [[autonomy]] or self-government than others within the same country can be considered constituent states of a larger sovereign state. This relationship is called a [[federacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Stepan |first=Alfred |author-link=Alfred Stepan |title=Federalism and Democracy: Beyond the U.S. Model |url=https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/fesnic/fspub/6_7_Stepan_1999_Federalism_J_of_Dem.pdf |journal=Journal of Democracy |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=19–34 |year=1999 |doi=10.1353/jod.1999.0072 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Autonomous republics]] like [[Karakalpakstan]] in [[Uzbekistan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/898586b1dc7b4043c1256a450044f331/8be9009ac37f2d75c1256f17004b6e68/$FILE/G0443118.doc International Covenant On Civil And Political Rights], p 5. [[United Nations]] [[Human Rights Committee]]. Accessed 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Within a non-state constitutional entity==
States existing in [[Associated state|free association]] with another can be considered constituent states of a constitutional entity. For example, the [[Cook Islands]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Niue]] constitute the three constituent countries of the [[Realm of New Zealand]], united under a single [[head of state]]: the [[Monarchy of New Zealand|King or Queen of New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gg.govt.nz/ Website of the Governor-General of New Zealand].

==Breakaway states==
The term can also be applied as an alternative to formal recognition of a [[List of active autonomist and secessionist movements|secessionist state]] that has unilaterally declared [[Unilateral declaration of independence|independence]], and whose ''[[de jure]]'' [[sovereignty]] remains [[List of states with limited recognition|in dispute]].

===The Caucasus===
The [[South Caucasus]] region consists of a number of breakaway and [[autonomous republic]]s in addition to the states of [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] recognised by the [[United Nations]].

The breakaway republics of [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]], which have effectively maintained independence since declaration, are considered constituent republics of Georgia by the majority of world governments. The [[Republic of Artsakh]], which is also independent in effect, is considered by the United Nations to be a constituent entity of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Aghayev |first=Nasimi |title=Caucasian Review of International Affairs |page=13 |year=2008| accessdate=2009-11-01 |url=http://se2.isn.ch/serviceengine/Files/RESSpecNet/104432/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/1FB98779-D2B2-4F7C-A2DF-342E28FE5E3F/en/Full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyprus===
The country of Cyprus is divided between two independent political entities: the internationally recognised [[Republic of Cyprus]] in the south, and the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], which is recognised as a sovereign state only by [[Turkey]]. Both entities are given the title of constituent state of Cyprus by the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], and the [[Annan Plan for Cyprus|Annan Plan]] for [[Cypriot reunification|reuniting Cyprus]] consistently used the term constituent state to refer to each entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unficyp.org/media/Other%20official%20documents/annanplan.pdf Annan Plan - Final Revision] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721064828/http://www.unficyp.org/media/Other%20official%20documents/annanplan.pdf |date=2011-07-21 }}.

Because of the [[Somali Civil War|ongoing war]] in [[Somalia]], the [[Somali people|Somali]] country is now divided into a number of constituent [[States and regions of Somalia|states]] with varying degrees of independence from the [[Transitional Federal Government]].

The breakaway republic of [[Somaliland]] in the north, which maintains ''de facto'' independence over its territory, is still regarded by member states of the United Nations as a constituent state of [[Somalia]] despite its [[declaration of independence]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7365002.stm Somaliland's 'Path to Recognition'].

The change in terminology reflects the fact that these divisions are afforded a larger degree of autonomy than before, with each state having its own constitution. As a [[unitary republic]], however, the [[government of Palau]] is [[central government|centralised]] and these divisions exist solely to establish regional government; they are not united in a federal union.

Like Palau, the government of [[Myanmar]], or Burma, presently operates as a unitary state, with sovereignty confined within the central [[government of Myanmar|government]]. Burma comprises a number of "states", which exist alongside the country's regional [[Administrative divisions of Burma|divisions]].&lt;ref name="cia200910"/&gt; Both "states" and "divisions" can be described as ethnically defined; while the [[Bamar]] remain predominant within divisions, the states are mostly dominated by [[List of ethnic groups in Burma|minority groups]].&lt;ref name="sbswg2008"&gt;{{Cite book

In terms of politics, the use of the term "state" in this context is largely historical, with a number of these states having been united in various federal unions during the [[British Empire|British]] colonial period. At present, most states are afforded a greater degree of autonomy than other divisions. Political [[List of active autonomist and secessionist movements|separatism]] in many states is rampant, and territory controlled by the central government in these cases is limited. In these cases, jurisdiction within a state is mostly confined to its respective regional government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=15456 Wa Army to Celebrate 20th Anniversary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417082050/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=15456 |date=April 17, 2009 }}. Wai Moe (2009). [[The Irrawaddy]]. Accessed 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, various proposals have been made for instituting [[federalism]] in Burma, which would allow these states to implement individual constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burmalibrary.org/show.php?cat=2117 Federal and State Constitutions] Online Burma Library.

==Other uses==
The term "constituent state" is sometimes also used to refer to member states of an [[international organisation]]. It is used within the [[European Union]] to refer to member states. It is also used to refer to sovereign states in [[Bilateralism|bilateral]] negotiations or agreements between two or more states.

'''Continental Chile''' is the name given to the [[Chile]]an territory located on the continental shelf of [[South America]]. This term serves to distinguish the South American area from the insular territories, known as '''[[Insular Chile]]''', as from the '''[[Chilean Antarctic Territory|Antarctic Chile]]''' (Chilean Antarctic Territory). The existence of this three areas of effective or claimed Chilean [[sovereignty]] is what supports the existing [[tricontinental principle]] in this country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icarito.cl/medio/articulo/0%2C0%2C38035857_152308993_152512596_1%2C00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613235801/http://www.icarito.cl/medio/articulo/0,0,38035857_152308993_152512596_1,00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 13, 2008 |title=Chile: un país tricontinental |accessdate =March 29, 2008 |author=Icarito |date= |editor-link=www.icarito.cl|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acague.cl/publicaciones/CD19/sel/3/a3.pdf |title=Principios geopolíticos de Chile |accessdate=March 29, 2008 |format=PDF |author=Instituto Geopolítico de Chile |date= |editor-link=www.acague.cl|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gobiernodechile.cl/canal_regionalgeo_nacional_det.asp?id_geo=1 |title=Geografía nacional: Situación, superficie y extensión |accessdate=November 29, 2007 |format=ASP |author=[[President of Chile]], [[Ministry General Secretariat of Government (Chile)|Ministry General Secretariat of Government]] |year=2007 |editor-link=www.gobiernodechile.cl|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, this term specifies the [[time zone]]s  of mainland Chile and the [[Juan Fernández archipelago]] and the [[Desventuradas Islands]], located in the UTC-3 time zone, as "continental Chile". [[Easter Island]] and the [[Isla Salas y Gómez]], both in [[Polynesia]], are in the UTC-5 time zone.

Continental Chile has a surface of 756,770&amp;nbsp;km², representing 99.976% of the total surface of the country under effective administration. However, considering the claim in [[Antarctic]], this percent fall down to only 37.71% of national's surface.

With regard to the population, according to the 2002 census, it had a total of 15,111,881 inhabitants, corresponding to 99.97% of the national population.

== Asia ==

=== Bangladesh ===

Bangladesh has 5 toll bridges and 4 toll roads. None of them are of an electronic collection system. In Bangladesh, roads and bridges are built by the Government. After building the roads and bridge, the governmement invites tender to give an Operation and management (O&amp;M) contract for 5 years against a fee. The O&amp;M operators maintains the bridge and collects toll on behalf of the government. The toll tariff of Bangabandhu Multipurpose Bridge (formerly known as Jamuna Bridge), length 4.8&amp;nbsp;km, the longest bridge of the country is considered very high compared with other bridges. Mr. Md. Mobarak Hossain, the CEO of Marga Net One Limited (Joint Venture by Pt. Jasa Marga (Persaro) Indonesia and Net One Solutions Ltd. Bangladesh who was also the CEO of the 2nd O&amp;M Operator of Bangabandhu (Jamuna) Bridge, feels that Taka 400 (USD 6.00)per private car is too high, while the trucks and loriies pays a maximum of USD 18.00 for single trip. The Bangabandhu Bridge is a vital link connecting the eastern part of the country with its northern part.

===China===
[[Image:TongshanXian-G106-G316-junction-0020.jpg|thumb|Toll plaza at the junction of [[China National Highway|National Highways]] G106 and G316 in [[Tongshan County, Hubei]]]]
Nearly all Chinese expressways and express routes charge tolls, although they are not often networked from one toll expressway to another. However, beginning with the [[Jingshen Expressway]], tolls are gradually being networked. Given the size of the nation, however, the task is rather difficult.

[[China National Highway]]s, which are not expressways, but "grade-A" routes, also charge tolls. Some provincial, autonomous-regional and municipal routes, as well as some major bridges, will also charge passage fees. In November 2004, legislation in China provided for a minimum length of a stretch of road or expressway in order for tolls to be charged.

===Hong Kong===
{{further|List of tunnels and bridges in Hong Kong}}
In [[Hong Kong]], most tunnels and some bridges that form part of the motorway networks are tolled to cover construction and maintenance costs.  Some built recently are managed in the [[Build-Operate-Transfer]] (BOT) basis.  The companies which build the tunnels or bridges are given franchise of a certain length of time (usually 30 years) to operate.  Ownership will be transferred to the government when the franchise expires. An example is the [[Cross Harbour Tunnel]].

=== India===
{{main|Indian Expressways}}
[[Image:Mumbai Pune ExpresswayDec2007.jpg|thumb|[[Mumbai-Pune Expressway]], [[India]]]]
[[Expressway (India)|Access-controlled roads]] in India are tolled. In addition to cash tolls, toll plazas have dedicated [[electronic toll collection]] lanes for quicker operation.

In addition, most of the [[NHDP|upgraded sections]] of the [[National Highway (India)|National Highway]] network are also tolled. These tolls are lower than those on expressways. The length of [[Expressway (India)|Indian Expressways]] is more than {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}}, also more than {{convert|2500|km|abbr=on}} of expressways are already under construction.

Currently, a [[National Highways Development Project|massive project]] is underway to expand the highway network and the [[Government of India]] plans to add an additional {{convert|18637|km|abbr=on}} of expressways to the  network by the year 2022.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report_expressway-cost-pegged-at-rs20-crore-km_1381235 Govt plans to build 18637 km expressways]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indonesia ===
''Further information: [[List of toll roads in Indonesia]]''
[[Image:Jakpek36.JPG|thumb|KM 36 of [[Jakarta–Cikampek Toll Road]].]]
[[Indonesia]] opened its first toll road, the [[Jagorawi Toll Road]], in 1978. This linked the capital city of [[Jakarta]] to the neighboring cities of [[Bogor]] and [[Ciawi]] south of the capital. 
Today, the system is still limited in its existence, as major toll routes remain in and around the major cities of [[Jakarta]], [[Bandung]], [[Surabaya]], and [[Semarang]]. 
Recently, development in inter–city routes has increased. In 2005, the [[Cipularang Toll Road]] connecting [[Bandung]] in [[West Java]] to [[Jakarta]] was completed. This is a major development for the Indonesian transport system, as a drive between [[Jakarta]] and [[Bandung]] can now be completed in just under 3 hours.

In 2015, the [[Cikampek–Palimanan Toll Road]] connecting [[Jakarta]] and [[Cirebon]] in [[West Java]] was completed. This is another major development as this Toll Road connects [[Jakarta–Cikampek Toll Road]] and [[Palimanan–Kanci Toll Road]], and a drive between [[Jakarta]] and [[Central Java]] using this Toll Road can now be completed around 4 hours.

Indonesia had 34 toll roads until October 2015 :

'''North Sumatra''' : 
[[Belmera]], connecting [[North Sumatra]].

'''Jakarta and Banten''' : 
[[Jakarta–Serpong Toll Road]], [[Jakarta–Tangerang Toll Road]], [[Tangerang–Merak Toll Road]], 
[[Prof. Dr. Sedyatmo Toll Road]], connecting [[Jakarta]] and [[Banten]].

'''Jakarta''' :
[[Jakarta Inner Ring Road]], [[Jakarta Outer Ring Road]], connecting [[Jakarta]].

'''Jakarta and West Java''' :
[[Jakarta–Cikampek Toll Road]], [[Jagorawi Toll Road]], connecting [[West Java]] and [[Jakarta]].

'''West Java''' :
[[Cipularang Toll Road]], [[Padaleunyi Toll Road]], [[Bogor Ring Road]], [[Cikampek–Palimanan Toll Road]], [[Palimanan–Kanci Toll Road]], [[Kanci–Pejagan Toll Road]], connecting [[West Java]].

'''Semarang, Central Java''' :
[[Semarang Section A, B, C Toll Road]], [[Semarang–Ungaran Toll Road]] connecting [[Semarang]].

'''East Java''' :
[[Surabaya–Gresik Toll Road]], [[Surabaya–Gempol Toll Road]], [[Waru–Juanda International Airport Toll Road]], 
[[Surabaya–Madura Bridge Toll Road]], connecting [[East Java]].

'''Denpasar, Bali Island''' :
[[Bali Mandara Toll Road]], connecting Ngurah Rai Airport–Nusa Dua, Ngurah Rai Airport–Denpasar–Benoa.

'''Makasar, South Sulawesi''' :
[[Makassar Airport Toll Road]], connecting [[Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport]].	
 
Plans for another inter–city route in [[Central Java]] between the cities of [[Semarang]] and [[Surakarta]] are under development. Eventually,{{when|date=April 2016}} the whole city in island of Java will be connected by [[Trans–Java toll road]] from [[Merak, Banten|Merak]], [[Banten]] to [[Ketapang]], [[East Java]]. If the [[Sunda Strait Bridge]] is built, the highway network in Java and Sumatra will be connected. By 2025, Indonesia may be connected with the Asia by [[Malacca Strait Bridge]] and [[Trans-Sumatra Toll Road]]. Indonesia also has a project to build [[Trans-Kalimantan Toll Road]] and [[Trans-Sulawesi Toll Road]].

[[Highway 6 (Israel)|Highway 6]] in [[Israel]], widely known as the Trans-Israel Highway or Cross-Israel Highway, is to date the only electronic toll highway in Israel. Currently Highway 6 is 110&amp;nbsp;km long, all of which is a freeway. This figure will grow in the next few years as additional segments, currently undergoing statutory approvals and permitting processes, are added to the main section of the road. Highway 6 uses a system of cameras and [[transponders]] to toll vehicles automatically. There are no toll booths, allowing Highway 6 to be designed as a normal freeway with interchanges.

=== Japan ===
{{Main|Expressways of Japan}}
The vast majority of Japan's extensive expressway consists of toll roads. Payment of the fare can either be made in cash as one exits or using the [[electronic toll collection]] card system.  As of 2001 the toll fees for an ordinary passenger car was 24.60 [[yen]] per kilometre plus a 150 yen terminal charge.

=== Malaysia ===
{{Main|Malaysian Expressway System}}
[[Malaysia]] has extensive toll roads that forms the majority of country's expressways which in length spans more than 1400&amp;nbsp;km ranging North to the Thai border, South to the Causeway and Second Link to Singapore, West to Klang and Pulau Indah and East towards Kuantan.  Most of the toll roads are in major cities and conurbations such as [[Klang Valley]], [[Johor Bahru]] and [[Penang]].  All of Malaysian toll roads are managed in the [[Build-Operate-Transfer]] basis as in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Japan]] (see [[#Japan|below]]).

===Pakistan===
{{Main|Motorways of Pakistan}}
All motorways and few expressways are toll roads. First such motorway M2 was opened to public in 1997. Since then the M3, M9, M10, and M1, all toll roads, have become operational. The M8 is under construction.

[[File:NAIA Expressway southbound.jpg|thumb|[[NAIA Expressway]]]]
Currently, the [[Philippines]] have ten toll roads, all on the main Island of [[Luzon]].

The 84 kilometer [[North Luzon Expressway]] or NLEx, connecting [[Manila]] with the Central and Northern parts of Luzon. It starts at [[Balintawak Interchange]] in [[Quezon City]], [[Metro Manila]] and ends at Sta. Ines in [[Pampanga]].

The 93.77 kilometer [[Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway]] or SCTEx, connecting the [[Subic Bay Freeport Zone]], [[Clark Freeport Zone]], and the Central Techno Park in [[Tarlac City]], [[Tarlac]]. It is also connected to the North Luzon Expressway via a Spur Road in Mabalacat, Pampanga which makes it the continuation of the connection of Manila to the provinces of Central and Northern parts of Luzon. It is the longest expressway in the Philippines.

The 51 kilometer [[South Luzon Expressway]] or SLEx connecting [[Manila]] with [[Santo Tomas, Batangas]]. It is composed of two segments namely, the Osmeña Highway (formerly/also known by many as South Superhighway) which starts from [[Paco, Manila]] and continues until [[Alabang]] in [[Muntinlupa]] and the Alabang-Calamba-Santo Tomas Expressway, which is also known as the South Luzon Tollway (SLT), which comprises the Alabang to Santo Tomas, Batangas segment.

The 16 kilometer [[Metro Manila Skyway]] or simply Skyway is an elevated expressway that connects Manila with [[Alabang]], [[Muntinlupa City]] which is located above the SLEX.

The 42 kilometer [[Southern Tagalog Arterial Road]] or STAR Tollway which runs south from [[Santo Tomas, Batangas]] to the City of [[Batangas City|Batangas]]. It is also connected to the South Luzon Expressway via an exit in Santo Tomas, Batangas since 2010 which makes it the continuation of the connection of Manila to the provinces of the Southern part of Luzon as it also a part or extension of the Radial Road 3 network (see [[Radial Road 3]]).

The 14 kilometer [[Manila–Cavite Expressway]] or CAVITEx is an expressway in the south of the Manila metropolitan area. Connects Manila with the province of [[Cavite]].

The 88.85 kilometer [[Tarlac–Pangasinan–La Union Expressway]] is a four lane expressway currently under construction north of Manila in the Philippines. It connects Central Luzon and North Luzon. It starts at SCTEX in Tarlac Exit and currently ends at Binalonan Exit in [[Pangasinan]]. When the expressway is complete, the northern terminus will be at Rosario Exit in [[La Union]].

The 8.8&amp;nbsp;km [[Subic-Tipo Expressway]] or the NLEx Segment 7 is a two lane expressway in which the alignment traverses the provinces of [[Zambales]] and [[Bataan]]. It begins at Rizal Highway in [[Hermosa, Bataan]] and ends at [[Subic Freeport Zone]]/SBMA at [[Olongapo, Zambales]].

The 4&amp;nbsp;km [[Muntinlupa-Cavite Expressway]], which is also known as MCX and formerly Daang Hari-SLEX Link Expressway is a long access-controlled toll expressway linking the southern province of [[Cavite]] to [[Muntinlupa]] in the [[Philippines]]. The east end is the SLEX in Muntinlupa and the west end is at Daang Hari and Daang Reyna Road junction in Cavite.

The 11.6 kilometer [[NAIA Expressway]] is an elevated expressway that runs from the [[Metro Manila Skyway]] to [[Diokno Boulevard]], and [[Ninoy Aquino Avenue]] and [[NAIA Road]] near [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] Terminal 3. This elevated expressway project is divided into 4 packages. This is also the first airport expressway in the Philippines. It is located in [[Pasay]] and [[Parañaque]], and a little portion in [[Taguig]].

Only the North Luzon Expressway and the South Luzon Expressway (including the Skyway) have an [[electronic toll collection]] system, which is based on the 5.7&amp;nbsp;GHz standard.

===  Singapore ===
''Further information: [[Singapore Area Licensing Scheme]], [[Electronic Road Pricing]]''

In Singapore, toll stations are automated, thus reducing manpower. The automated toll stations, also known to the locals as [[Electronic Road Pricing|ERP]] or Electronic Road Pricing, was introduced by [[Land Transport Authority]] (LTA) to reduce city traffic jams. Although it is advanced, it is still unpopular among Singaporean drivers. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The number of toll stations is increasing rapidly and some Singaporeans even call it "Every road pay".

=== Sri Lanka ===

Sri Lanka currently operates 2 toll roads. The Southern Expressway (E 01) and the Katunayake Expressway (E 03). The Kandy Colombo Expressway (E 02) is under planning at the moment (2013). The toll revenue is used to repair and maintain the expressways.

=== Taiwan===

[[Image:Taiwan Freeway Toll Station Notification.gif|250px|left|thumb|A typical toll booth notification sign in Taiwan]]
[[Image:Taiwan road sign Art060.3.png|100px|right|thumb|Taiwanese Toll Booth Sign off freeways meaning: stop the vehicle to pay toll]]

Freeways in Taiwan are not exactly toll roads in the sense that toll gates/stations are not located at the entrance and exits of the freeway.  Toll stations with [[weigh station]]s are located every thirty to forty kilometres on the No. 1 and No. 3 National Freeways of the [[Republic of China]]. There are usually no freeway exits once a toll station notification sign appears, making it necessary for the driver to be familiar with the locations of the toll stations in advance.

''See [[Highway System in Taiwan#Toll station]] for more detailed information.''

Other toll roads in Taiwan are usually newly built bridges and tunnels. Tolls are frequently collected to pay off the construction cost and once paid off, the tolls may be repealed.

=== Tajikistan ===
Toll roads in Tajikistan are owned and operated by Innovative Road Solutions (IRS). The northern point is in the in Sughd Viloyat and the Southern point ends at Kurgan Tyube (100&amp;nbsp;km south of the capital of the country - Dushanbe). While going from end to end costs roughly $12 US Dollars for regular 2 axle vehicles, it can top to $100 for semitrucks. The IRS is setting up new toll plazas that are going to be able to read off the digital device attached to windshield while passing through at the speed of no more than 15 kph, similar to ones in the United States. This is the only toll road in the entire Central Asia with about 5 cars going through each toll plaza every minute in every direction. The more information can be found on their homepage at www.IRS.tj

=== Thailand ===
Most of the toll roads in Thailand are either within [[Greater Bangkok]] or originated from Bangkok.  They are called [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]], [[tollway]]s, and [[motorway]]s.  Two government agencies under the Ministry of Transport, namely the Expressway Authority of Thailand (EXAT) and the Department of Highways (DoH), own networks of toll roads.  Some are operated by the agencies themselves; others are operated by private concessionaires.  EXAT is in charge of Chaloem Mahanakhon Expressway, Si Rat Expressway, Chalong Rat Expressway, Udon Ratthaya Expressway, Burapha Withi Expressway and Kanchanphisek Outer Ring Road (southern section).  DoH is in charge of Uttraphimuk Tollway (formerly [[Don Mueang]] Tollway), Motorway No. 7 (Bangkok-[[Chonburi (city)|Chonburi]]), and Motorway No. 9 (Kanchanphisek Outer Ring Road - eastern section).  Both agencies have plans to build more toll roads in the future, expanding their networks to the provinces.

[[Electronic Toll Collection]] using passive [[RFID]] tags is used in Chaloem Mahanakhon, Si Rat, Chalong Rat, and Burapha Withi Expressway while Uttraphimuk Tollway  employs passive IC-card-based [[contactless payment|Touch-and-Go]] system.  There are plans to upgrade and expand ETC systems in the near future.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
The toll system [[Salik (Road Toll)|Salik]] started in [[Dubai]] in July 2007.

== Africa ==

===Morocco===
[[Image:A3 Rabat.jpg|thumb|[[Casablanca–Rabat expressway]]]]
[[Morocco]] has an extensive system of toll roads or Autoroutes. These were for the most part recently built, and from [[Casablanca]] connect all of Moroccos major cities such as [[Marrakech]], [[Rabat]], and [[Tangier]]. Operator [[Société Nationale des Autoroutes du Maroc|Autoroutes Du Maroc]] runs the network on a pay-per-use basis, with toll stations placed along its length. Goal is completing a North-South and an East-West link crossing the country. Both axis will be important sections of the ''Pan-African'' main links.&lt;ref&gt;Moroccan operator [[Société Nationale des Autoroutes du Maroc|ADM's]][http://www.adm.co.ma/admin_files/rapport2007.pdf Year 2007 report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720194551/http://www.adm.co.ma/admin_files/rapport2007.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}, PDF file, downloaded 22 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mozambique===
The Mozambique South Africa Tollway was established in 2014 and is run by private contractors leasing the highway from the Mozambican Government and tolls will be established on many other important paved roads in Mozambique

===South Africa===
In South Africa many of the [[National routes (South Africa)|National routes]] have sections that are toll roads. In cities such as [[Cape Town]] and [[Durban]] the freeways are free of charge. However, with the introduction of electronic tolling (e-tolls) as part of the [[Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project]], tolls were introduced on the upgraded the urban freeways that are National Roads in the province of [[Gauteng]], which includes [[Johannesburg]] and [[Pretoria]]. These Gauteng tolls met resistance in the media and from parts of the population.[https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195422/http://www.thinkafricapress.com/south-africa/buckle-up-going-be-long-ride-e-tolls-gauteng-anc-da] Toll roads are run by the [[South African National Roads Agency Limited]][http://www.nra.co.za/index.html] or in the case of routes like the N3 and N4, by concessionaires.

===Zimbabwe===
In 2013 the Ntabazinduna Toll Plaza was opened outside of Bulawayo and the toll system was introduced by a South African Group named Group Five as part of a government project to provide safer highways and to also benefit the local community and also the local economy. Additionially eight more toll plazas will be operating in Zimbabwe.

== Europe ==
{{Main|Toll roads in Europe}}
Toll roads in Europe have a long history. The first turnpike road in England was authorised in the seventeenth century. The term ''turnpike'' refers to a gate on which sharp pikes would be fixed as a defence against cavalry. Early references include the (mythical) Greek ferryman [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] charging [[Charon's obol|a toll to ferry (dead) people]] across the river [[Acheron]]. Germanic tribes charged tolls to travellers across [[mountain pass]]es. Tolls were used in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the 14th century and 15th century.

In some European countries payment of road tolls is made using stickers which are affixed to the windscreen.  [[Germany]] uses [[Toll Collect|a system]] based on satellite technology for large vehicles.  In other countries payment may be made in cash, by credit card, by pre-paid card or by an [[electronic toll collection]] system. Tolls may vary according to the distance travelled, the building and maintenance costs of the motorway and the type of vehicle.

Some of these toll roads are privately owned and operated.  Others are owned by the government.  Some of the government-owned toll roads are privately operated.

=== Belarus ===
Major highways in Belarus are [[toll roads]] with [[Open road tolling]] (ORT) or free-flow tolling. BelToll is an [[electronic toll collection]] system (ETC), valid from 1 July 2013 in the Republic of Belarus.

=== Croatia ===
[[Image:Autocesta A1 kod Trogira.jpg|thumb|[[A1 (Croatia)|A1 motorway]] near [[Trogir]].]]
Almost all Croatian highways are [[toll road]]s with the exception of the [[Zagreb bypass]] and [[Rijeka bypass]]. Most of the highways feature a [[closed toll collection]] system. Tolls are usually calculated according to the basic formula of 0,40 [[Croatian kuna|kn]]/km, multiplied by a factor according to the vehicle category. There are four [[Vehicle classification in Croatia|vehicle categories in Croatia]]:

# two-axle vehicles, up to 1.30 m tall measured at the front axle, including motorcycles
# three and multi-axle vehicles, up to 1.30 m tall measured at the first axle, including all vans
# vehicles more than 1.30 m tall measured at the first axle, including all vans with trailers
# same as the 3rd class, but at least four axles

At some motorways, the motorcycles are classified as a separate category and charged less than two-axle vehicles.

Each class of vehicles pays approximately 1,5 times the toll paid by the previous class. The length and the exact toll for a highway section can be found at the official website of Croatian highway authority.&lt;ref name="hrhac"&gt;[[Hrvatske autoceste]] (HAC) - Croatian highway authority&lt;/ref&gt; If a highway features an [[open toll collection]] system, the toll for the whole highway is paid at a mainline plaza. Such toll collection attracts the [[shunpike]]rs.

There are four Croatian companies that build and maintain highways and collect tolls:

* [[Hrvatske autoceste]] (Croatian Motorways Ltd)
* [[Autocesta Zagreb - Macelj]] (Zagreb - Macelj Motorway)
* [[Autocesta Rijeka - Zagreb]] (Rijeka - Zagreb Motorway)
* [[BINA Istra]]

=== France ===
[[Image:French Autoroute.jpg|thumb|A typical French autoroute.]]
In Europe, the most substantial use of toll roads is in [[France]], where most of the [[Autoroutes of France|autoroute]]s carry quite heavy tolls. In a number of countries the companies have often fallen in and out of the public sector,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and many have had financial problems.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

=== Iceland ===
The [[Hvalfjörður Tunnel]] is tolled.

=== Ireland ===
The [[Republic of Ireland]] has three toll roads, three toll bridges, and two toll tunnels, which are operated by various independent operators. Most were built under a [[public-private partnership]] system, giving the company which arranged for the road to be built the right to collect tolls for a defined period. Tolls vary from €1.65 to €12 for cars.

=== Italy ===

Most [[Autostrada|Italian motorways]] are toll roads, with some exceptions such as some motorways in [[Southern Italy]] and [[Sicily]] or the ''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'' ([[Rome]]'s ring road).

In most motorways, toll is proportional to the distance traveled and has to be paid on exit, where toll gates — {{it}} ''caselli'' — are placed. On other motorways, however, toll gates are placed directly along the route — {{it}} ''barriere'' —. In such cases, it is required to pay a fixed amount, regardless of the distance traveled. [[Autostrada A8 (Italy)|A8]], [[Autostrada A9 (Italy)|A9]], [[Autostrada A52 (Italy)|A52]] are good examples of that system.

Toll can be paid in cash, by credit card, by pre-paid card, or by [[Telepass]].

61% of the Italian motorways are handled by the "Autostrade per l'Italia S.p.A." company, and its subsidiaries. All of these carriers are now privately owned and supervised by ANAS. The network of motorways covers most of [[Italy]]: northern and central Italy are well covered, the south and Sicily are scarcely covered, [[Sardinia]] is not covered at all.

The motorway operators are required to build, operate and maintain their networks at cost and to cover their expenses from the toll they collect. The tolls vary according to the building and maintenance costs of the motorway and the type of vehicle.

Besides the motorways, only some alpine tunnels (such as the [[Mont Blanc Tunnel]]) are tolled. Today, no toll is required on other roads, including motorway-like [[dual carriageway]]s — {{it}} ''superstrade''. The first tolled superstrada is under construction now north of Venice.

=== The Netherlands ===
In the beginning of the 20th century, almost all communities collected toll on all passing traffic, usually including pedestrians and livestock. In 1953, the central government abolished all communal tolls.

As of 2008, there are three effective toll roads in Netherlands. They are for the [[Western Scheldt Tunnel]], [[Kil tunnel]], both major arteries, and the "Tolbrug" (Toll Bridge) in [[Nieuwerbrug]], a local hand-drawn bridge. Also, for the [[Wijkertunnel]], a "shadow toll" is paid by [[Rijkswaterstaat]] for each passed vehicle.

=== Norway ===
Norway has extensively been using toll as a way to finance road infrastructure in the last decades. The toll is called "bompenger" (gate coin) which from comes the first toll roads in Norway, private roads where owners were allowed to charge traffic. The toll ends when the road has been paid off.

There are also toll rings around some cities, where drivers have to pay to enter or leave the city, regardless of if the road is new or old. The first city was [[Bergen]] in 1986. The money goes to construction of intrastructure in and around the city.

=== Poland ===
[[File:Punkty poboru opłat.svg|thumb|Toll plazas in Poland]]
There are three toll highways in Poland, connecting the major cities and the nation's boundaries. Two routes travel east–west, one running between [[Łódź]] and the German border, the other currently connecting [[Katowice]] and [[Kraków]], with current construction extending the roads to the German and Ukrainian boundaries. A north–south route connects Rybnik to Katowice, and [[Torun]] to [[Gdańsk]].

=== Portugal ===
In [[Portugal]] a certain number of roads are designated Toll-Roads. They charge a fixed value per kilometre distance, with several classes depending on vehicle type and regulated by the government. Several authorised franchises run them, the largest at present being [[Brisa - Auto-estradas de Portugal|BRISA]]. For cash-free payments there exists the [[Via Verde]], an electronic toll collection system. On leaving the motorway, charges are automatically debited from a bank account.

=== Russia ===
A number of toll roads in Barnaul and Pskov Region (Nevil-Velezh (RUR 190 ($8)), Pechori-state border RUR 140), also M4-Don (18&amp;nbsp;km close to Lipetsk costs RUR20($0,75) for cars and RUR40 ($1,7) for trucks).

Overall toll network is 383&amp;nbsp;km or 0,05% of total road network. Average price in Pskov region having 226&amp;nbsp;km of toll roads is RUR 2,4-5,5 per km for cars, and RUR 7,9-19,5 for trucks. This comes close to $0,5 per km for trucks.

Ordinary speed limits apply so far. In 2007 adopted Toll Road Law and Concession Law in 2005 to develop this sector.

=== Slovenia ===
For the use of 464,7&amp;nbsp;km of the [[Highways in Slovenia|Slovenian freeways and expressways]] use of toll stickers is obligatory for all vehicles with the permissible maximum weight of 3.5 tons on motorways and expressways as of July 1, 2008. The sticker costs are €15 for 7 days, €30 for a month and €95 for a year. Motorcyclists have to pay €7.50 for 7 days, €25 for a half year and €47.50 for a year.&lt;ref name=price_DARS&gt;[http://www.dars.si/Dokumenti/Toll/Methods_of_payment/Vehicles_up_to_35_t/Vignette_308.aspx Vignette prices on DARS.si]&lt;/ref&gt; Trucks use existing toll road stops.&lt;ref name=cestnina&gt;[http://www.cestnina.si/Default.aspx?id=19766 Cestnina v Sloveniji&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080826075216/http://www.cestnina.si/Default.aspx?id=19766 |date=2008-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of highways and expressways without a valid and properly displayed sticker in a vehicle is a violation of the law and is punished with a fine of €300 or more.&lt;ref name=wieninternational /&gt;

Due to the high costs of toll stickers for transit drivers going to vacation to [[Croatia]]n and [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] coast and others only passing through Slovenia, the highways are avoided by some travellers.&lt;ref name=wieninternational&gt;{{cite web

=== Spain ===
Most [[Spain|Spanish]] toll roads are networked, so you must get a ticket on entering and pay when leaving the road. Technically, all roads belong to the Government, although toll roads are built and maintained by private companies under a State concession; when the concession expires, the road is reverted to State ownership, however most of then are renewed. Toll roads are called in Spanish ''[[Controlled-access highway|autopistas]]''. Freeways, often comparable to ''autopistas'' in building and ride quality, are called '' [[autovía]]s''.

There are some ''autovías'' which are actually built and maintained by private companies, such as Pamplona-Logroño A-12&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navarra.es/home_es/Actualidad/Informes/Obras+Publicas+Transportes+y+Comunicaciones/Autivia+Pamplona-Estella+Logrono.htm Navarra.es Navarran Autonomous Community news bulletin, February 5 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/ediciones/2006/04/26/vecinos/estellaymerindad/d26est31.586230.php Noticias de Navarra, May 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205716/http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/ediciones/2006/04/26/vecinos/estellaymerindad/d26est31.586230.php |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Madrid access road M45.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/madrid/M-45/negocio/sombra/elpepuespmad/20050808elpmad_1/Tes El País, August 8 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The company assumes the building costs and the [[Autonomous Community]] where they are located (in the given examples, [[Navarre]] and [[Madrid]]) pays a yearly per-vehicle fee to the company based upon usage statistics, called "shadow toll" (in Spanish, ''peaje en la sombra'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalmadrid.info/2007-04-02/4293.html Capital Madrid, march 30 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120730010406/http://www.capitalmadrid.info/2007-04-02/4293.html |date=2012-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system can be regarded as a way for the Government to finance the build of new roads at the expense of the building company. Also, since the payment starts only after the road is finished, construction delays are usually shorter than those of regular state-owned freeways. However, those cannot be classified as toll roads since drivers do not need to pay any fees.

=== Sweden ===
The border-crossing [[Oresund Bridge|The Oresund Bridge]] and [[Svinesund Bridge]] have tolls. The [[Stockholm congestion tax|Stockholm]] and [[Gothenburg congestion tax|Gothenburg]] City areas have [[congestion pricing]] on entry. The [[Sundsvall Bridge]] is a proper toll bridge. Before the year 2000 road tolls did not exist in Sweden for several decades.

=== Switzerland ===

[[Image:A2 Bridge.jpg|thumb|The [[A2 motorway (Switzerland)|A2 motorway]] in [[Ticino]], suspended over viaducts]]
For the use of [[Motorways of Switzerland|Swiss motorways]] the use of toll stickers is obligatory. They costs CHF&amp;nbsp;40 per year per vehicle (a car towing a trailer needs two stickers). There are no stickers for shorter periods and they are valid 14 months (the 2010 sticker is valid from 1 December 2009 until 31 January 2011). However, this also means that a sticker bought any time during the year can only be used for less than the maximum period until January 31 of the following year.

=== Republic of Turkey ===

In the Republic of [[Turkey]] toll is collected on certain highways, the so-called ''Otoyolları'' or ''Karayolları''. This is done so by three different systems. Every toll road has lanes for all three payment methods. One method is KGS (Kartlı Geçiş Sistemi) ([[English language|English]]: ''Card passage system'') which requires a [[Stored-value card|Prepaid]] card to be presented at the toll port. Every passing will be withdrawn from the card. Another method is HGS (Hızlı Geçiş Sistemi) ([[English language|English]]: ''Fast passage system''.) which uses a [[RFID]] chip stuck to the windshield of the vehicle. This chip is scanned automatically when passing the toll collecting point and money will be automatically withdrawn from the connected bank account. The last system is OGS which is calles ''Otomatik Geçiş Sistemi'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and translates ''Automatic passage system'' in [[English language|English]]. This form of payment requires a fixed amount of money to be paid for a monthly or annual subscription. When subscribed, your car will be equipped with a [[barcode]]d sticker, which will be checked by [[CCTV]] cameras automatically to check if the car is actually subscribed. The Turkish toll system can't be avoided (except for avoiding toll roads), because one can simply not pass KGS without the required card, and due to the cameras, all cars passing OGS and HGS with no or expired or counterfied chips or stickers will get a fine nicely presented at their home address.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{main|Toll roads in Great Britain|Turnpike Trust}}
[[Image:M6 Toll plaza, Great Wyrley.jpg|thumb|[[M6 Toll|M6]] Toll plaza for northbound traffic at [[Great Wyrley]]]]
Road rates were introduced in [[England]] in the seventeenth century. The first turnpike road, whereby travellers paid tolls to be used for road upkeep, was authorised in 1663 for a section of the [[Great North Road (United Kingdom)|Great North Road]] in [[Hertfordshire]].  The first [[turnpike trust]] was established by Parliament through a Turnpike Act in 1706. From 1751 until 1772 there was a flurry of interest in turnpike trusts and a further 390 were established. By 1825 over 1,000 trusts controlled 25,000 miles (40,000&amp;nbsp;km) of road in England and [[Wales]].

The rise of [[railway]] transport largely halted the improving schemes of the turnpike trusts. Unable to earn sufficient revenue from tolls alone the trusts took to requiring taxes from the local parishes. The system was never properly reformed but from the 1870s Parliament stopped renewing the acts and roads began to revert to local authorities, the last trust vanishing in 1895. The [[Local Government Act 1888]] created county councils and gave them responsibility for maintaining the major roads. There are still a small number of toll bridges left including [[Swinford toll bridge]] near [[Oxford]].

Most UK roads today are maintained from general taxation, some of which is raised from motoring taxes including [[Hydrocarbon oil duty|fuel duty]] and [[vehicle excise duty]].  Today, there are few tolls on roads in the United Kingdom - mainly toll bridges and tunnels. Until recently there were only two toll roads to which there is a [[public right of way]] (Rye Road in [[Stanstead Abbotts]] and College Road in [[Dulwich]]) together with another five or so private toll-roads. However, the motorway recently constructed to the north of [[Birmingham]] levies a usage charge, and is therefore known as the [[M6 Toll]]. It is potentially the first of a new generation of toll roads.

== North and South America ==

=== Brazil ===
In [[Brazil]], toll roads are a recent institution, and were adopted mostly in non-federal [[highways]]. The state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] has the highest length of toll roads, which are exploited either by private companies which bought a concession from the state, or by a state owned company (see [[Highway system of São Paulo]]). In São Paulo there is also a statewide electronic collection system using a plastic transponder (e-tag) attached to the windscreen, named ''SemParar'''. There is a growing trend towards tolling in all major highways of the country, but some resistance by the population is beginning to be felt, particularly due to some abuses which are being imposed, restricting the constitutional rights of coming and going (because the Brazilian highway system has very few non-tolled vicinal roads in parallel to highways) and making some trips an extremely expensive affair, as compared to average Brazilian earning power (in São Paulo, a 1,000&amp;nbsp;km round trip may cost upward of two hundreds [[Brazilian real]] in some roads, higher than petrol expenses).

=== Canada ===
Most tolled roadways in [[Canada]] are bridges to the [[United States]], although a few domestic bridges in some provinces have tolls. In [[Vancouver]], tolls were set up to pay for the construction of the new [[Port Mann Bridge]] which connects the [[Trans Canada Highway]] from [[Surrey]] to [[Coquitlam]] over the [[Fraser River]].  Toll highways disappeared, for the most part, in the 1970s and 1980s.  In the 1990s, political pressure dropped the new tolls on an upgraded section of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] in [[New Brunswick]].  [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway 407]] in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] is a modern ''toll route'' and does not have collection booths but an overhead sensor. It's heavily criticized as the government leased it for 99 years with the company having unlimited control of the highway and tolls so it is expensive, but still a necessity for gridlocked [[Toronto]]. [[Nova Scotia]] has a toll highway on the Trans Canada Highway between [[Debert, Nova Scotia|Debert]] and [[Oxford, Nova Scotia|Oxford]].

=== Colombia ===
Many highways in [[Colombia]] charge tolls. Motorcycles are allowed to bypass for free.

=== Ecuador ===
The [[Pan-American Highway]] in [[Ecuador]] charges tolls. Motorcycles pay a reduced fare.

=== Mexico===
[[Mexico]] has an extensive system of toll roads or Autopistas. Autopistas are built and funded by Federal taxes and are built to nearly identical standards as the US Interstate Highways System. Also, many states in Mexico have their own toll roads such as Puebla, Veracruz and Nuevo León. Motorcycles pay the same fare as cars.
All federal toll highways operate with 3 payment options, cash, credit card and electronic tag IAVE.
IAVE in all the highways is operated by Caminos y Puentes Federales (CAPUFE).

=== Panama ===
Most of the toll roads in [[Panama]] were built in the mid 1990s, with the exception of the [[Arraijan-Chorrerra Highway]]. The three modern toll roads were built after the transportation plan made by the Government of [[Japan]] in the mid 1980s using the [[Build–operate–transfer|BOT]] formula. This highways are the [[Corredor Norte]] in the north of the [[Panama City]], and the [[Corredor Sur]] in the south. Another highway was built and is the [[Panama-Colon Highway]].

=== Puerto Rico ===
There are several toll roads in Puerto Rico, where toll roads are called "autopista" (which loosely translates to "car raceway") and toll houses are called "peaje".

=== United States ===
{{Main|Toll roads in the United States}}
[[Image:Pennsylvania Turnpike westbound.jpg|thumb|[[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] westbound, approaching Pittsburgh interchange with I-376/US 22.]]
[[Image:Dallas North Tollway - Texas State Highway Loop 12 Northwest Highway - 4548 - jpfagerback 2013-05-07.jpg|thumb|[[Dallas North Tollway]] just north of the [[Texas State Highway Loop 12|Northwest Highway]]]]

A ''toll road'' in the United States, especially near the east coast, is often called a ''turnpike''. The term ''turnpike'' originated from the ''turnstile'' or gate which blocked passage until the fare was paid at a ''toll house'' (or ''toll booth'' in current terminology). Most tolled facilities in the US today use an [[electronic toll collection]] system as an alternative to paying cash. Examples of this are the [[E-ZPass]] system used on most [[toll bridge]]s and toll roads in the eastern U.S. from [[North Carolina]] to [[Maine]] and [[Illinois]]; [[Houston]]'s [[EZ Tag]], which also works in other parts of the state of [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]]'s [[PikePass|Pikepass]] (which also works in Texas and Kansas), [[California]]'s [[FasTrak]], [[Illinois]]' [[I-Pass]], and [[Florida]]'s [[SunPass]]. Toll roads are only in 26 states as of 2006. The majority of states without any turnpikes are in the [[Western United States|West]] and [[Southern United States|South]].

After a halt in toll road construction following the establishment of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in 1956, many states are going back to implementing tolls to fund capital improvements and manage congestion.  This is because the cost of expanding and maintaining the highway network is increasing faster than the amount of revenue that can be generated by the federal [[gasoline tax]] for the [[Highway Trust Fund]].  Years after abolishing tolls, [[Kentucky]] and [[Connecticut]] are both re-examining the possibility of reinstating tolls on some highways, while several other states are advancing the construction of new toll roads to supplement their existing networks of toll-free expressways.

== Oceania ==

=== Australia ===
In Australia, a small number of motorways have been tolled due to cover the expense of their construction. Such roads can be found in the Australian cities of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. There are no toll roads in the Australian states of [[South Australia]], [[Western Australia]], [[Tasmania]] or any of the mainland [[States and territories of Australia|territories]]. Toll collection is by electronic toll collection; there are no longer any cash booths in Australia.

In [[Brisbane]], there are three tollway operators ([[Brisbane City Council]], [[Queensland Motorways]], and [[RiverCity Motorway]]).  Brisbane City Council owns and operates the [[Go Between Bridge]] over the [[Brisbane River]] in the city.  Queensland Motorways operates the tolls on the [[Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges]], and another two on the [[Logan Motorway]] on the south side.  RiverCity Motorway operates the [[Clem Jones Tunnel]], which runs underneath the city between the inner southern and northern suburbs.  All toll collection points are electronically operated. Another company, BrisConnections, is currently constructing another toll tunnel (the longest tunnel in Australia) called the [[Airport Link, Brisbane|Airport Link]], and will allow traffic to flow from the northern Clem Jones - [[Inner City Bypass]] interchange, direct to [[Brisbane Airport]].  Construction is due to be complete in 2012. International Travellers and people that are new to Brisbane should note, the penalty for non payment of tolls is in excess of $140 (per trip). It is best to avoid toll roads at all costs as it really saves little time and is often classed by the general Brisbane public as "revenue raising".

In [[Melbourne]], there are two companies that operate tollways within the Melbourne metropolitan area. Transurban operates [[CityLink]] covering sections of the [[Monash Freeway]], Southern Link, Western Link and the upgraded sections of the [[Tullamarine Freeway]]. ConnectEast operates [[EastLink, Melbourne|EastLink]] that runs through the Eastern Suburbs of Melbourne. All Melbourne tollways are electronically tolled. The [[West Gate Bridge]] opened as a toll bridge upon its completion in 1978, however the toll was abolished in 1985.

In [[Sydney]], many of the motorways contain at least one tolled section with a mixture of government and private ownership. The State Government owns the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] and [[Sydney Harbour Tunnel]], while the [[Metroad 2|M2 Motorway]], [[Metroad 4|M4 Motorway]], [[Metroad 5|M5 Motorway]], [[Eastern Distributor]], [[Westlink M7]] and [[Lane Cove Tunnel]] are privately operated by a variety of companies such as Macquarie Infrastructure, Transurban, and to a lesser extent Industry Super funds such as Retail Employees Super, SunSuper, and the Industry Funds Management which partly own the M5 motorway in South Western Sydney.

As well as the tolled motorways, the [[Cross City Tunnel]] - an east–west route underneath the Sydney CBD - was opened to traffic in 2005. This road has become somewhat controversial due to the relatively high toll charge and the closure of surrounding roads designed to funnel traffic through the tunnel.

All Sydney tollways accept E-tags; the [[Westlink M7]], [[Sydney Harbour Tunnel]], [[Cross City Tunnel]], [[Lane Cove Tunnel]] and from 1 December 2007 on the [[M2 Hills Motorway|M2 Motorway]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070705000527/http://www.hillsm2.com.au/transurban_online/ne5nav_hills.nsf/LinkView/7701C3D3519B46E2CA2572C80075D69CABD5DAB709F88F70CA25703E0064DA30] [http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22023173-5001021,00.html] have no cash booths, just E-Tag readers to zoom on through as they charge their tolls only through electronic tolling methods or through the use of number plate reading as you go through, then you have to pay after a certain time frame (for example; before 24 hours), otherwise you will get a fine in the mail. The [[M5 South Western Motorway|M5 Motorway]] moved to electronic only tolling in 2013. Tolls on the [[M4 Western Motorway|M4 Motorway]] were abolished in 2010. An E-Tag is an RFID device that allow a driver to pass through a toll point without physically stopping. When a vehicle fitted with an E-Tag passes through a toll collection point, the E-Tag identifies the electronic account of the vehicle passing through and the toll-road operator recovers the toll via that account. There are four providers of E-tag accounts in New South Wales (RTA, RoamTag, Interlink Roads, and M2 Consortium). All tags provided by these four providers can be used on every E-Tag-enabled tollway in Australia.

=== New Zealand ===
* [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] was opened in 1959 and operated as a toll bridge until 1984. In the 1960s a group of university students attempted to disrupt the toll system by repeatedly crossing the bridge using motor-scooters (to which a very low toll applied), and paying their toll in £5 notes; the hope was that they would exhaust the supplies of change held at the toll booths. However, the toll authority got wind of their plans and got a very large supply of small change (copper coinage), so the students were soon weighed down with large amounts of small change.
* The [[Lyttelton Road Tunnel]], linking the City of [[Christchurch]] with the harbour at [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]], was originally a Toll Tunnel built in 1962. The government of the day promised that as soon as the tunnel was paid for, the toll would be removed The promise was kept, and the toll was removed in the mid-1970s once the tunnel had been paid off. The Tunnel Authority building and toll booths are still there at the Heathcote end.
* The City of [[Tauranga, New Zealand|Tauranga]] operates a toll road running between the outlying settlement of Tauriko on State Highway 2 and central business district of the city. This toll road also act as a feeder route for the [[Tauranga Harbour Bridge]]. Tolls are collected by staff operating tollbooths at the western end of the road.
* The Northern Gateway Toll Road is a 7.5&amp;nbsp;km motorway extension to State Highway 1 just north of [[Auckland]]. Northbound, the toll road begins just before [[Orewa]] and ends via a pair of road tunnels through the Johnstone Hills near Puhoi. The toll road opened in January 2009 and gives motorists a choice between a more direct route or State Highway 17 via Orewa. Tolling is implemented through automatic vehicle license plate reading with cameras in an overhead gantry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36685">The '''geology of Finland''' is made up of a mix of [[geologic time|geologically very young and very old]] materials. Common rock types are [[gneiss|orthogneiss]], [[granite]], [[metamorphic rock|metavolcanic]]s and [[metasedimentary]] rocks. On top of these lies is a widespread thin layer of unconsolidated deposits formed in connection to the [[Quaternary glaciation|Quaternary ice ages]], for example [[esker]]s, [[till]] and [[marine clay]]. The [[topographic relief]] is rather subdued because mountain [[massif]]s were worn down to a [[peneplain]] long ago.

As Finland is in the older part of the Fennoscandian Shield, its basement rocks are within three of the shield's older subdivisions known as domains: the Kola, Karelian and Svecofennian domains. This subdivision, established by Gaál and Gorbachev in 1987, is based on the different [[historical geology|geological histories]] of the domains prior to their final amalgamation 1,800 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal22-23/&gt;

===Kola Domain===
{{further|Kola Province}}
The extreme northeast of Finland is part of the Kola Domain because it shows considerable affinity with the geology of the [[Kola Peninsula]] in Russia. Around [[Lake Inari]] there are [[paragneiss]], [[orthogneiss]] and [[greenstone belt]]s. Rocks in this part of Finland are of [[Archean]] and [[Proterozoic]] age.&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal6-7/&gt;

To the south and west of Lake Inari lies an elongate and arcuate zone of [[granulite|granulite rock]] known as the [[Lapland Granulite Belt]]. The belt is up to 80 km wide. The main rocks of the belt are [[migmatite|migmatized]] [[greywacke]] and [[Argillite|argillites]]. Studies of [[Detritus (geology)|detrital]] [[zircon]] show that the sedimentary [[protolith]] of the metamorphic rocks of the belt could not be more than 2900–1940 million years old.&lt;ref name=Sveriges2011-60-61&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lundqvist |first1=Jan |last2=Lundqvist |first2=Thomas |last3=Lindström |first3=Maurits |last4=Calner |first4=Mikael|last5=Sivhed |first5=Ulf |author-link1=Jan Lundqvist |author-link2=Thomas Lundqvist (geologist)|author-link3=Maurits Lindström|edition=3rd |date=2011 |title=Sveriges Geologi: Från urtid till nutid |chapter=Svekokarelska Provinsen |language=Swedish |location=Spain |publisher=[[Studentlitteratur]] |isbn=978-91-44-05847-4 |archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |subscription= |quote= |pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belt has [[norite]] and [[enderbite]] [[intrusion]]s of [[Calc-alkaline magma series|calc-alkaline chemistry]].&lt;ref name=Lahetal2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Lahtinen |first=Raimo|last2=Korja |first2=Annakaisa|last3=Nironen |first3=Mikko|last4=Heikkinen |first4=Pekka|editor1-last=Cawood |editor1-first=P.A.|editor2-last=Kröner|editor2-first=A.|date=2009 |title=Earth Accretionary Systems in Space and Time |chapter=Palaeoproterozoic accretionary processes in Fennoscandia|url= |location= |publisher=Geological Society, London, Special Publications|volume=318 |page=237–256 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karelian Domain===
The Karelian Domain, or Karelian Block, makes up most of the bedrock of the northeastern part of Finland&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal4-5&gt;Vaasjoki ''et al''. 2005, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; extending into nearby areas of Russia.&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal22-23&gt;Sorjonen-Ward &amp; Luukkonen 2005, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; The Karelian domain is made up of a [[Collage (geology)|collage]] of rock formed during [[Archean]] and [[Paleoproterozoic]] times.&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal4-5/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal6-7&gt;Vaasjoki ''et al''. 2005, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary to the Kola Domain is made up of a gently dipping [[décollement]] where the [[Lapland Granulite Belt]] has been thrust southward over rocks of the Karelian Domain.&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal24-25/&gt;

Archean rocks in the Karelian Domain are north-south [[metamorphic grade|medium grade]] [[greenstone belt|greenstone]] and [[metasediment|metasedimentary]] belts. The belts are intruded by [[granite|granitoids]], usually [[QAPF diagram|monzogranite]] and [[granodiorite]]. Besides these belts and intrusions there is also [[metasedimentary]] [[gneiss]] formed at [[metamorphic facies|intermediate pressures]].&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal22-23/&gt; Along the central part of the [[Finland–Russia border]] lies the [[Belomorian Province|Belomorian terrane]], a subunit of the Karelian Domain thought to have formed by a [[continental collision|collision]] between the Kola Domain with the Karelian Domain in the [[Paleoproterozoic]].&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal22-23/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal24-25&gt;Sorjonen-Ward &amp; Luukkonen 2005, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; This collision marked the final merger of both crustal blocks.&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal70-71&gt;Sorjonen-Ward &amp; Luukkonen 2005, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Rocks of the Belomorian terrane, like the [[granitoid]] [[gneiss]]es common there, are of [[metamorphic grade|high grade]].&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal24-25/&gt;

The Central Lapland granitoid complex covers up much of the interior of northern Finland. These rocks were formed in the final stages of the Svecofennian orogeny and are mostly made up of coarse-grained granites.&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal457-458&gt;Nironen 2005, pp. 457–458.&lt;/ref&gt; An alignment of granitoid intrusions southeast of [[Oulu]] likely shares the same origin.&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal459-460&gt;Nironen 2005, pp. 459–460.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finland's three [[ophiolite]]s [[Outcrop|crop out]] within the Karelian Domain. These are the Jormua, Outokumpu and Nuttio ophiolite complexes.&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal239-240/&gt; All of them were [[obduction|emplaced]] in Paleoproterozoic times.&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal241-242&gt;Peltonen 2005, pp. 241–242.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jormua and Outokumpu ophiolites lie parallel to and near the boundary with the Svecofennian Domain.&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal239-240&gt;Peltonen 2005, pp. 239–240.&lt;/ref&gt; Also towards the border with the Svecovefennian Domain there is a series of [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]] Archean rocks that are stacked into an [[Thrust fault#Thrust duplex|imbrication]] pattern.&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal24-25/&gt;

===Svecofennian Domain===

The southwestern part of Finland is mainly made up of rocks of the Svecofennian Domain or [[Svecofennian orogeny|Svecofennian orogen]].&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal4-5/&gt; These rocks are invariably of [[Proterozoic]] age. Its boundary with the Karelian Domain (of mixed [[Archean]] and [[Paleoproterozoic]] rocks) is a northwest-southeast diagonal.&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal4-5/&gt; [[Plutonic rock]]s that formed during [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]] of volcanic arcs or continental collisions of the Svecofennian orogeny are common in Svecofennian Domain.&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal445-446&gt;Nironen 2005, pp. 445–446.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal447-448&gt;Nironen 2005, pp. 447–448.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these rocks the largest grouping is the Central Finland granitoid complex covering up much of [[Central Finland]], [[Southern Ostrobothnia]] and [[Pirkanmaa]].&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal447-448/&gt; Granitoids that intruded in the aftermath of the Svercofennian orogeny are common in southern Finland occurring mostly within ca. 100 km of the [[Gulf of Finland]] or [[Lake Ladoga]].&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal447-448/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal455-456&gt;Nironen 2005, pp. 455–456.&lt;/ref&gt; These so-called Lateorogenic granites are distinguished by usually containing [[garnet]] and [[cordierite]] and being accompanied by rather few rocks of [[mafic]] and [[Intermediate composition|intermediate]] composition.&lt;ref name=Lehtinenetal455-456/&gt; Scattered small granitoids crop out within the same zone.

Finland has a thriving quarrying industry. Finnish [[dimension stone]] has been used historically for buildings in Helsinki and [[Russian Empire|imperial Russia's]] [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Tallinn|Reval]]. Today, the main importers of Finnish stone are China, Germany, Italy and Sweden. The dimension stone quarried in Finland includes granites, such as the wiborgite variety of [[rapakivi granite]], and [[marble]]. [[Soapstone]] from Finland's [[schist]] zone is also quarried for use in ovens.&lt;ref name=UppFiSTEN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uppslagsverket.fi/sv/sok/view-103684-Stenindustri |title=Stenindustri |last=Backman |first=Sigbritt  |date=June 28, 2010 |website=[[Uppslagsverket Finland]] |publisher= |access-date=November 30, 2017 |quote= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geo map Balt shield4 no.PNG|thumb|Geological map of Fennoscandia]]
The '''geology of Norway''' encompasses the history of earth that can be interpreted by [[rock types]] found in [[Norway]], and the associated [[sedimentological]] history of soils and rock types.

The Norwegian mountains were formed around 400 million years ago (Ma) during the [[Caledonian orogeny]].

==Precambrian==
Rocks of [[Archean]] age in Norway are confined to a few 10&amp;nbsp;km-scale areas within younger [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic belt]]s exposed on islands off the west coast of northern Norway and as smaller fragments locally in the [[Western Gneiss Region]] in south-central Norway.&lt;ref name="LBT_english"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nordgulen|first1=Ø|last2=Andresen|first2=A.|editor=Ramberg I.B. |editor2=Bryhni I. |editor3=Nøtvedt A. |editor4=Rangnes K.|title=The Making of a Land &amp;ndash; Geology of Norway|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rMVNE0F2SckC&amp;pg=PA68 |accessdate=14 August 2011|year=2008|publisher=Norsk Geologisk Forening|isbn=978-82-92394-42-7|pages=62&amp;ndash;119|chapter=The Precambrian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite intense reworking during the [[Caledonian orogeny]] in some areas, three major belts can be recognised in the [[Proterozoic]] rocks of Norway, the [[Neoproterozoic]] and [[Mesoproterozoic]] Gothian and [[Sveconorwegian orogeny|Sveconorwegian]], the [[Palaeoproterozoic]] Svecokarelian and the intervening [[Transscandinavian Igneous Belt]] of late Palaeoproterozoic age. About 1400 million years ago in the Mesoproterozoic [[extensional tectonics|tectonic extension]] and continental magmatism led to the formation of [[Kattsund-Koster dyke swarm]] in southeastern Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hageskov |first=Bjørn |last2=Pedersen |first2=Svend |date=1988 |title=Rb-Sr age determination of the Kattsund-Koster dyke swarm in the Østfold-Marstrand belt of the Sveconorwegian Province, W Sweden - SE Norway |url= |journal=Bulletin of the Geological Society of Denmark |publisher= |volume=37 |issue= |pages=51–61 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoproterozoic===
The later part of the Neoproterozoic records the break-up of the [[Rodinia]] [[supercontinent]] and the formation of the [[Iapetus Ocean]]. Passive margin sequences are preserved within the lowermost [[allochthon]] and [[parautochthon]] of the Caledonian [[Thrust fault|thrust]] sheets. In southern Norway the sequence is known as ''Sparagmite''. The [[sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environment]] changes from [[fluvial]] in the parautochthon to deepwater marine in the lowermost allochthon consistent with a [[paleogeography]] of an originally westward deepening [[Sedimentary basin|basin]].

The uppermost part of the Neoproterozoic sequence throughout Norway includes a [[tillite]], a record of the Varanger [[ice age]] which occurred between roughly 630-590 Ma, the final part of the [[Cryogenian]] Period. This was followed by fluvial and shallow water marine deposits of the [[Ediacaran]] before a major marine [[transgression (geology)|transgression]] at the start of the [[Cambrian]].

==Early Palaeozoic==
[[File:Slemmestad rocks text.jpg|thumb|Cambrian conglomerate, limestone and [[Alum shale]] B, lying  [[Unconformity|unconformably]] above Precambrian [[gneiss]] D, intruded by a Permian [[lamprophyre]] [[sill (geology)|sill]] A, [[Slemmestad]], western [[Oslofjord]]]]
The early [[Palaeozoic]] history of Norway is recorded in sequences preserved either as autochthon or at various levels within the allochthon. They relate to the further widening of Iapetus during the Cambrian, the start of closure during the Early [[Ordovician]] with the [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]] of [[terrane]]s and [[ophiolite]] [[obduction]] during the Late Ordovician and continent-continent collision at the end of the [[Silurian]].

==Caledonian orogeny==
Within the entire exposed 1800 kilometre length of this [[Orogeny|orogenic belt]] the following sequence is recognised from the base upwards:
* [[wiktionary:Autochthon|Autochthon]]
: undisturbed foreland of the [[Baltica|Baltic plate]]
* Parautochthon
: [[Thrust fault|thrust]] sheets that have moved only a short distance (up to tens of km) from their original position
* Lower [[allochthon]]
: far travelled thrust sheets derived from the Baltic plate [[passive margin]], mainly sediments associated with the break-up of [[Rodinia]]
* Middle allochthon
: also derived from the margin of the Baltic plate, [[Proterozoic]] basement and its [[Psammite|psammitic]] cover
* Upper allochthon
: thrust sheets including [[island arc]] and [[Ophiolite|ophiolitic]] sequences
* Uppermost allochthon
: thrust sheets containing sediments with fossil assemblages indicating an origin on the margin of the [[Laurentia|Laurentian plate]]

This vertically stacked sequence thus represents the [[passive margin]]s of Baltica and Laurentia and intervening island arcs and [[back-arc basin]]s telescoped together and emplaced on top of the [[Baltic Shield]], involving hundreds of kilometres of shortening.

==Devonian==
[[File:Storehesten.jpg|thumb|View of Storehesten in [[Gaular]], part of the Kvamshesten massif, formed of Devonian [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]]s and [[sandstone]]s in tectonic contact with thick [[mylonite]]s of the [[Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment]]]]
Devonian age continental sediments are exposed in three main areas in  and around mainland Norway; the [[Solund]], [[Kvamshesten]], [[Håsteinen]] and [[Hornelen]] basins along the west coast between [[Sognefjord]] and [[Nordfjord]], on the islands of [[Smøla]], [[Hitra]] and the western end of the [[Fosen]] Peninsula in Trøndelag and at Røragen near [[Røros]] close to the Swedish border. Further Devonian deposits are found on Svalbard.&lt;ref name="LBT_english"/&gt;

During the [[Devonian]] Period the thickened welt of crust formed by the Caledonian orogeny began to collapse. Some thrust surfaces show evidence of reactivation as low-angle extensional faults, but the main structures formed at this time were large-scale extensional [[Detachment fault|detachments]]. Movement on these detachments led to deposition of thick sequences of continental clastic sediments in their hanging walls and was in part responsible for the exhumation of late Caledonian ultra high-pressure [[metamorphic rock]]s, including [[eclogite]]s, in their footwalls. The displacements on these structures range from nearly orthogonal to the Caledonian chain in the south to being strongly oblique in mid-Norway.

==Carboniferous==
The only [[Carboniferous]] age strata preserved onshore are found on [[Svalbard]]. Rocks of this age have also been proved by drilling beneath the [[Barents Sea]], but nowhere else on the Norwegian continental shelf.

==Permian==
In southern Norway the [[Permian]] was a period of W-E directed [[rift]]ing with associated igneous activity, during which the [[Oslo graben]] formed.

==Triassic==
The only [[Triassic]] rocks preserved onshore are found on Svalbard but strata of this age are also widely known from the results of exploration drilling along the entire continental shelf.

==Jurassic==
[[File:North Sea Central Graben.jpg|thumb|North Sea Central Graben]]
[[File:North Sea Viking Graben.jpg|thumb|North Sea Viking Graben]]
Rocks of [[Jurassic]] age are exposed onshore at one locality on [[Andøya]] and have been discovered nearshore and beneath one fjord (Beitstadsfjord) northeast of Trondheim. As with the Triassic, Jurassic strata have a wide distribution along the whole continental shelf. They were dominantly deposited in a [[River delta|deltaic]] to shallow marine environment.

The Late Jurassic was the main rifting phase in the Central [[Graben]], Viking Graben, More [[Structural basin|Basin]], Vøring Basin and on the Barents shelf. This was also the period of deposition of the main [[source rock]] that has generated most of the [[petroleum]] discovered in the offshore areas.

==Cretaceous==
The Late Jurassic basins offshore were infilled and onlapped by the [[Cretaceous]] post-rift sequence. These are dominated by [[mudstone]]s although the Upper Cretaceous sequence from the Viking Graben and south is dominated by [[chalk]].

In the outer parts of the Vøring margin rifting restarted in the late Cretaceous, continuing through to the early [[Palaeocene]]. This event is interpreted to be a precursor to the break-up of the North Atlantic.  Little is known of the then elevation of what would be the area of current day Norway.

'''George Masa''' (1881 - June 21, 1933), born '''Masahara Izuka''', in Osaka, Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wcu.edu/hunter-library/collections/special-collections/manuscripts/george-masa.asp | title=George Masa - Hunter Library, Western Carolina University| accessdate=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[businessman]] and professional [[large format]] [[photographer]].

==Creating a new life in America==
Masa arrived in the [[United States]] in 1901.

In 1915, he settled in [[Asheville]], [[North Carolina]], where he would spend the final 18 years of his life.

After initially working for the [[Grove Park Inn]] as a bellhop and valet, Masa left the inn to take a position as a photographer in February 1919. Eventually, he founded Plateau Studio (a business he later sold, which is still in operation today).&lt;ref name="The Mystery of George Masa"&gt;{{cite video | title = The Mystery of George Masa | medium = Documentary | publisher = Bonesteel Films | location = Asheville, North Carolina | date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His customers included some of the town's most affluent citizens such as the [[George Washington Vanderbilt II|Vanderbilt]], [[Edwin Wiley Grove|Grove]], and [[Fred Loring Seely|Seely]] families.

==The Great Smoky Mountains==
Masa came to love the mountains of [[Western North Carolina]] and worked tirelessly for their preservation, often at his own expense. Using his photographic equipment and an odometer he crafted from an old bicycle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highlandshistory.com/HHS/exhibit4/vexmain4.htm | title=George Masa Collection - Highlands Historical Society | accessdate=2007-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masa meticulously catalogued a significant number of peaks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://toto.lib.unca.edu/findingaids/mss/CMC/cmc_16a_massa_letters/cmc_16a_george_masa_papers.htm | title=George Masa Papers -  Ramsey Library, University of North Carolina at Asheville | accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the distances between them, and the names given to them by the local settlers and the [[Cherokee]].&lt;ref name="The Mystery of George Masa"/&gt;  He was a friend of [[Horace Kephart]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wcu.edu/library/digitalcoll/kephart/onlineexhibit/People/Photography.htm | title=Horace Kephart - Revealing an Enigma, Hunter Library, Western Carolina University| accessdate=2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two of them worked together to ensure that [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park|a large portion]] of the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] would be established as a [[national park]]. Masa also scouted and marked the entire North Carolina portion of the [[Appalachian Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bonesteelfilms.com/masastory.html | title=The Mystery of George Masa - Bonesteel Films | accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Masa died in 1933 from [[influenza]]. He sincerely desired to be buried next to his friend Kephart near [[Bryson City, North Carolina]],&lt;ref name="hikehistory"&gt;"[http://www.smokymountainnews.com/issues/07_05/07_13_05/mtn_voices.html A hike with a bit of history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218140144/http://www.smokymountainnews.com/issues/07_05/07_13_05/mtn_voices.html |date=2006-12-18 }}", ''The Smoky Mountain News,'' 13 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; but was instead buried in Asheville's [[Riverside Cemetery (Asheville, North Carolina)|Riverside Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="hikehistory" /&gt;

One year after Masa's death, the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] was officially established.&lt;ref name="hikehistory" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanparknetwork.com/parkinfo/content.asp?catid=68&amp;contenttypeid=32 American Park Network - GSMNP].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, [[Masa Knob]], a peak of 5685 feet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wayhoo.com/index/a/wdet/wid/1441616/waypoint/Masa%20Knob/ | title = Masa Knob - wayhoo.com | accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, was named in Masa's honor.&lt;ref name="hikehistory" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toto.lib.unca.edu/findingaids/mss/CMC/carolinamountainclub.htm |title=Carolina Mountain Club Archive - Ramsey Library, University of North Carolina at Asheville |accessdate=2007-04-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216100140/http://toto.lib.unca.edu/findingaids/mss/CMC/carolinamountainclub.htm |archivedate=2007-02-16 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It stands, appropriately, adjacent to [[Mount Kephart]].

==Documentaries==
Interest in Masa's life was revived by documentary film-makers more than 60 years after his death. Bonesteel Films released a 90-minute documentary about George Masa in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bonesteelfilms.com/masa.html | title = The Mystery of George Masa - Bonesteel films | accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the fourth episode of [[Ken Burns]]' documentary about "[[The National Parks: America's Best Idea]]" features George Masa (entitled "Going Home" covering the period between1920–1933) which was initially broadcast on September 30, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Burns, [https://www.pbs.org/nationalparks/about/  PBS, "The National Parks,"] &amp;ndash; [https://www.pbs.org/nationalparks/people/behindtheparks/kephart-masa/ People Behind the National Parks, George Masa]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''link road''' is a transport infrastructure road that links two conurbations or other major road transport facilities, often added because of increasing road traffic. They can be controversial, especially if they threaten to destroy [[Habitat|natural habitat]] and [[greenfield land]].

The term is used in the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastsussex.gov.uk/roadsandtransport/bexhillhastingslinkroad/ Bexhill to Hastings link road], [[East Sussex]], England.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.f3linkroad.com/ F3 Link Road], Kurri Kurri Corridor to [[Branxton, New South Wales]], Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States state of [[List of Nebraska Connecting Link, Spur, and Recreation Highways|Nebraska]].
An example of a link road is [[Marston Ferry Road]] in [[Oxford]], [[England]]. It was built in the late 20th century link [[North Oxford]] with [[Marston, Oxford]] to the east.

This is a '''list of media''' related to the 1988 film '''''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''''', including books, [[animated short]]s, comic books and a video game.

==Books==
*''[[Who Censored Roger Rabbit?]]'' by [[Gary K. Wolf]] is the book on which the film is nominally based. {{ISBN|0-345-30325-3}}
*''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' by Martin Noble is the novelization of the film of the same name. {{ISBN|0-352-32389-2}}

[[Image:PluggedRabbit.jpg|thumb|200px|''Who P-P-P-Plugged Roger Rabbit?'' book cover]]

===''Who P-P-P-Plugged Roger Rabbit?''===
'''''Who P-P-P-Plugged Roger Rabbit?''''' is a mystery/humor novel written by [[Gary K. Wolf]] released in 1991 ({{ISBN|0-679-40094-X}}). The book is neither a [[sequel]] nor a [[prequel]] to ''Who Censored Roger Rabbit?'' or the film adaptation by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]. It is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off story]] with the same characters, just different situations. This style is like ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', where the episodes hold no continuity. The original novel was [[retconned]] as a dream of Jessica, in chapter 12.

The novel contains most of the original main cast members, such as [[Roger Rabbit]], [[Eddie Valiant]], [[Jessica Rabbit]], and [[Baby Herman]]. The personalities of each of these characters reflect more of their movie selves from ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'', such as Jessica's devotion to Roger and the rabbit's own more cartoony quirks, such as his [[speech impediment]].

====Plot summary====
The story starts out with [[Eddie Valiant]] at the front door of Roger Rabbit's house. Almost immediately after he is let inside the house, Roger tells him about the upcoming ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' toon adaptation and how he has a chance to play the lead as [[Rhett Butler]]. However, the ''Telltale News'', a newspaper that tends to toons, prints an article about [[Jessica Rabbit]] and her relationship with [[Clark Gable]]. Introduced in this novel is Jessica's diminutive twin sister, Joellyn, who becomes Eddie's main love interest as he has broken up with his girlfriend. We also meet Eddie's sister, who is in a mixed-race marriage with a toon, and has three children with her toon husband.

From this simple case, the story branches out to the [[homicide|murders]] of Kirk Enigman (another candidate for the part of Rhett Butler), [[Baby Herman]], and Dodger Rabbit (Roger Rabbit's evil cousin).

===''Who Wacked Roger Rabbit?''===
'''''Who Wacked Roger Rabbit?''''' is a mystery/humor novel written by [[Gary K. Wolf]] released in 2013.

===Children's picture books===
*''Roger Rabbit: A Different Toon'' by Justine Korman {{ISBN|0-307-11733-2}}
*''Roger Rabbit: Make the World Laugh'' by Justine Korman {{ISBN|0-307-11734-0}}
*''Who Framed Roger Rabbit: The Movie Storybook'' by Justine Korman  (1988) {{ISBN|0-307-65847-3}}

==Comic books==

===''Roger Rabbit''===
'''''Roger Rabbit''''' was a [[comic book]] series by [[Disney Comics]] starring characters from the 1988 film, ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', as well as following continuity from the film. It spawned a spin-off series entitled ''[[Roger Rabbit's Toontown]]'', which lasted five issues.

The series continues the adventures of Roger Rabbit, who has since returned to working for Maroon Cartoons, now under C.B. Maroon (a character introduced in the graphic novel, ''[[Roger Rabbit: The Resurrection of Doom]]''). The comics were usually split into two stories, with one main feature focusing on Roger's adventures, and a back-up feature presented to look like an actual animated subject.

Curiously, while characters like Jessica Rabbit, Baby Herman and Benny the Cab all appeared in the stories, Eddie Valiant was seldom seen, replaced by a new detective character named Rick Flint. This was explained in the first issue: Roger had a new case for he and Eddie to team up on. Eddie told Roger he wouldn't be able to help him that since defeating Judge Doom twice, there was renewed interest in Eddie's services as a detective and was too busy with various caseloads. So to not leave Roger on his own, Eddie referred him to a "new kid" private detective, Rick Flint. The actual editorial reason for omitting Eddie Valiant from the comic was not having the likeness rights to make Eddie resemble Bob Hoskins. Two other new characters introduced were Lenny, a toon plane who was Benny's cousin, and Mel, who was Roger's sentient mailbox.

The series had a one-off 3D strip as part of the ''[[Disney's Comics in 3-D]]'' series, which reprinted the back-up features of earlier comics and converted them into 3D. The comic-book line lasted 18 issues, and continued until the implosion of [[Disney Comics]].

===''Roger Rabbit's Toontown''===
'''''Roger Rabbit's Toontown''''' was a comic book published by [[Disney Comics]].  It features Roger and his supporting characters from Disney and Amblin Entertainment's ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit''. Every issue began with a Roger Rabbit story and his supporting characters such as his wife Jessica, his co star Baby and his taxi cab friend Benny round out the comic. This comic book lasted for five issues from May to August 1991.

This comic book is similar to the [[Roger Rabbit (comic book)|Roger Rabbit]] version of Walt Disney's Comics and Stories.

===Graphic novels and trade paperbacks===
*''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' (based on the movie)
*''Roger Rabbit: Tummy Trouble'' (based on the animated short)
*''Roger Rabbit: Who Framed Rick Flint'' (trade paperback featuring a story line from the ''Roger Rabbit'' comic series) {{ISBN|0-307-21803-1}}

====''Roger Rabbit: The Resurrection of Doom''====
'''''Roger Rabbit: The Resurrection of Doom''''' ({{ISBN|0-871-35593-0}}) is a graphic novel sequel that takes place between the film ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' and the [[Roger Rabbit]] short film ''[[Tummy Trouble]]''. It also helped to set the scene for the [[Roger Rabbit (comic book)|''Roger Rabbit'' comic-book series]] by [[Disney Comics]].

The comic opens with a documentary about the origin of [[Judge Doom]]&lt;!--Moving Doom's Origin to the section for his character in order to trim this summary--&gt;.  The documentary mentions the original character [[cel]] used to create Doom. Eddie Valiant is given credit for ending Doom's reign of terror by dissolving him in a puddle of Dip, stated as 'A victim of his own evil creation', and putting a stop to his plans to erase Toontown and build a freeway where it would have once stood.

A weasel, Slimy, is shown watching the documentary. He goes with two other weasels, Flasher and Ragtag, to find the original cel of Doom. They manipulate some [[animation|animators]] to bring Doom back to life. With time, Doom remembers everything that happened to him, and now wants revenge against both Eddie Valiant and Roger Rabbit for ruining his plans.

Meanwhile, Eddie Valiant is called by C.B. Maroon, the new executive of Maroon Cartoons, who announces they are reopening the studio, and pays Valiant $500 to run a search on the background of Roger Rabbit. Valiant finds Roger's records clean as a whistle.

Meanwhile, Roger and Jessica Rabbit are enjoying life at home as much as possible, despite Roger's unemployment following the closing of Maroon Cartoon Studios. Roger gets a call from Maroon Cartoons, saying they are reopening the studio, and that they want Roger to come work for them. Roger accepts the offer, and the next day, Roger meets C.B. Maroon, who starts Roger off with a very low-budget film (depicted in a [[Hanna-Barbera]]-esque style). Roger angrily objects to his part in the film, and is fired ("Get me [[Crusader Rabbit|that ''other'' rabbit with the tiger for a buddy!]]").

The next day, Roger finds dozens of scandalous, untrue headlines centered on himself. He turns to Valiant to find out why this is happening. Valiant first meets with C.B. Maroon, and questions him about firing Roger. Maroon reveals himself as Doom, tells his plan to ruin Roger's reputation and then kill him. He and the weasels knock Valiant out and lock him up in a storage locker, where Valiant meets the real C.B. Maroon. Doom, as C.B. Maroon, puts Maroon Studios up for auction, and the studio will be officially sold at noon.

Meanwhile, Roger and Jessica are about to leave for Simi Valley, but first go to Valiant's office to say goodbye, only to find the office ransacked. Jessica finds indentations of the address Valiant wrote on the last piece of paper he used. Rushing to the address, they find and rescue Eddie Valiant and C.B. Maroon. They leave to save Maroon Studios. Valiant sprays him and his weasels with the Dip-filled gag squirt gun, and before dissolving, "Maroon" reveals himself to be Doom.

The real C.B. Maroon announces he is re-opening Maroon Cartoon Studios, and will be providing all the toon employees with work, including Roger Rabbit and Baby Herman with a line-up of new animated short films, starting with ''Tummy Trouble''.

==Animated short films==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3832">The Persian Gulf is home to many [[island]]s, mostly small, distributed in the gulf's entire geographic area and administered by the neighbouring nations. Most islands are sparsely populated, with some being barren, and some utilized for communication, military, or as ship [[dock (maritime)|dock]]s. Some of the islands in the Persian Gulf are [[artificial island|artificially]] constructed islands. The artificial islands often serve as tourist resorts, housing developments, or hotels. Despite their small sizes, some of these artificial islands have caused serious hazards for the already fragile ecosystem of the Gulf and its dwindling wildlife mass. A few of the Gulf islands are also historically significant, having been utilized by the ancient empires, neighbouring kingdoms, and in the recent times, colonial powers such as the [[British empire]], and the [[Portuguese empire]]. Recent globalization, and discovery of oil, has made some of the Persian Gulf islands very significant for developed nations as a source of oil and raw industrial material. Recent wars, and political unrest has also made these islands strategic military locations for foreign powers from [[United States|America]] and [[Europe]].

Some Persian Gulf islands are nations themselves; [[Bahrain]], a recently independent [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf state]], is the only gulf country that is also an island.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11407">The following is a '''list of the Governors and Lieutenant Governors of Prince Edward Island''', known as ''St. John's Island'' until 1799. Though the present day office of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island|lieutenant governor in Prince Edward Island]] came into being only upon the province's entry into [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1873, the post is a continuation from the first governorship of St. John's Island in 1769.

{{Alsace sidebar}}
{{Lorraine sidebar}}
The territory of the former [[Alsace-Lorraine]], legally known as Alsace-Moselle,&lt;ref&gt;An instruction dated 14 August 1920, from the assistant Secretary of State of the Presidency of the Council to the General Commissioner of the Republic in Strasbourg gives notice that the term [[Alsace-Lorraine]] is prohibited and will be replaced by the sentence "the [[département of France|département]] of [[Haut-Rhin]], the département of [[Bas-Rhin]] and the département of [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]]". As this sentence was considered by many to be too long, the term ''Alsace-Moselle'' was coined. However, this term has no legal status in France as a regional designation.&lt;/ref&gt; is a region in the eastern part of [[France]], bordering with Germany. Its principal cities are [[Metz]] and [[Strasbourg]]. Alsace-Moselle was part of the [[German Empire]] from 1871 to 1918, and was subsequently reoccupied by Germany from 1940 until its recapture by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] at the end of [[World War II]]. Consisting of the two [[départements]] that make up the region of [[Alsace]], which are [[Haut-Rhin]] and [[Bas-Rhin]], and the département of [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]], which is the northeastern part of [[Lorraine (région)|Lorraine]], there are historical reasons for the continuance of '''local law in Alsace-Moselle'''. Alsace-Moselle maintains its own local legislation, applying specific [[convention (norm)|customs]] and [[law]]s on certain issues in spite of its being an integral part of France. These laws are principally in areas that France addressed by changing its own law in the period 1871&amp;ndash;1919, when Alsace-Moselle was a part of Germany.

Alsace-Moselle has a large number of speakers of a form of [[High German languages|High German]] known as [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]], an [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] dialect of [[Upper German]]. Its [[native speakers]] are mostly in [[Alsace]]. Several [[Franconian German|Franconian]] dialects of [[West Middle German]] are also spoken in the district of [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]], although their number of native speakers has dwindled significantly since the [[Second World War]] and the [[French language]] is now overwhelmingly heard in these districts. The region's German-language past is now, at the beginning of the 21st century, mostly evident in the names of towns, streets, villages and rivers. [[Protestantism]] is widespread in Alsace, while there are comparatively few Protestants in most other parts of France.

==Principles==
The local law ({{lang-fr|droit local}}) in Alsace-Moselle is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. It preserves those statutes made by the German authorities during annexation that were considered still to be beneficial in these territories following their return to France. Created in 1919, the local law preserves those French laws that were in force before 1870 and were maintained by the German government but were repealed after 1871 in France. It also maintains German laws enacted by the [[German Empire]] between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in the three concerned ''{{lang|fr|départements}}''.

In 1919, a [[Commissioner of the Republic]] (''{{lang|fr|Commissaire de la République}}''), whose duty was to restart the French administration in Alsace-Moselle following German defeat in [[World War I]], had to choose between local law and general law. These provisions were supposed to be temporary. However, two further enactments of 1 June 1924 made them permanent. These laws were extended six times between 1934 and 1951. The 1951 legislation did not have a time limit. Even at the beginning of the 21st century, for some laws in force in Alsace-Moselle, the German language text is considered the binding one, the translated French text serving only as a non-binding commentary.

==Religion==
{{Main|Concordat in Alsace-Moselle}}
Perhaps the most striking of the legal differences between interior France and Alsace-Moselle is the absence in Alsace-Moselle of a [[separation of church and state]] (cf. [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]]), even though a constitutional right of [[freedom of religion]] is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Moselle is still governed by a pre-1905 French law established by the [[Concordat of 1801]] which provides for the public subsidy to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Metz|Dioceses of Metz]] and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Strasbourg|of Strasbourg]], the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Protestant Church of Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine]], the Calvinist [[Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine]] and the [[Judaism|Jewish]] religion of the three local [[Consistory (Judaism)|Israelite consistorial ambits]] of Colmar, Metz, and Strasbourg, as well as providing for public education in these faiths; although parents are allowed to refuse religious education for their children. The clergy for these religions are on the state's payroll. Catholic bishops are named by the [[President of the French Republic]] following a proposal by the [[Pope]]. The heads of the Lutheran and Calvinist churches are appointed by the prime minister, after being elected by the competent religious bodies. The public [[University of Strasbourg]] has courses in [[theology]] and is famous for its teaching of Protestant theology.

This situation is unusual in a country like France where church and state are more strictly separated than in most other nations. There is debate over whether the second largest religion in [[France]], [[Islam]], should enjoy comparable status with the four official religions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/world/europe/07alsace.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;ref=world&amp;pagewanted=all A Pro-Church Law Helps a Mosque – NY Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some specific provisions==
In the area of work and finance, specific provisions have been made in local law for a local [[social security]] system, including additional, compulsory insurance and regulations governing remuneration during a short sickness absence. There are differences with French law also in the areas of [[personal bankruptcy]], [[voluntary association]]s and in local work law (''{{lang|fr|Code professionnel local}}''). Working is generally prohibited on Sundays and public holidays.&lt;ref&gt;The original German version of [http://www.idl-am.org/bj_contenu.asp?DocumentID=12 articles 105a to 105i of the local work law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024032216/http://www.idl-am.org/bj_contenu.asp?DocumentID=12 |date=2007-10-24 }} dated 26 July 1900, with translation into French on page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Alsace-Moselle has two more public holidays ([[Good Friday]] and [[St. Stephen's Day|26 December]]) than the rest of France and there are differences in the status of some crafts and trades, for example, winemakers and brewers.

[[Communes of France|Communes]] have to provide aid to resourceless people and they generally have more power than in the rest of France. They manage hunting rights, which are sold by auction for nine years at a time; land owners are not the owners of the [[game (hunting)|game]] and cannot forbid hunting on their land although the hunters are responsible for game's damage.

During political elections, most election literature is written bilingually in both French and German. The land book (''{{lang|fr|livre foncier}}'') is not held by the tax directorate but by a court service. Other differences include there being fewer pharmacies in Alsace-Moselle than in other ''{{lang|fr|régions}}'': 1 for every 3,500 people compared to 1 for every 2,500–3,000 elsewhere. [[Train]]s run on the right of the double tracks, as they did under the administration of the [[Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine]] and still do in [[Germany]], whereas in the rest of [[France]] they normally run on the left.

Since the end of the 20th century, some of the local laws have been incorporated into general law, especially in the areas of social security, personal bankruptcy and social aid. Some others have been repealed, like the work law and the election literature, which meet now the French general law. However, working on Sundays remains restricted ({{date|08.2009}}).

Retrieved 24 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically - that is, before the development of engineering technology that allowed the construction of tunnels and high-level road bridges - the lowest bridging point of a river was frequently the point at which an important town or city grew up, and particularly where trade and commerce took place.  The place could be served by roads on either side of the river, allowing access from a wide [[hinterland]]; had river transport available upstream; and often was at a location that allowed seagoing traffic to approach it from a downstream direction.

Examples of lowest bridging points in Britain include [[London]], the lowest bridging point on the [[Thames]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RKuWgcPPUJIC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=%22lowest+bridging+point%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g6kLU7-uG8P17AappICgBA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lowest%20bridging%20point%22&amp;f=false   Neil Anthony Punnett, ''The New Wider World'', Nelson Thornes, 2003, p.42]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], the lowest bridging point on the [[River Lune|Lune]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xm4KAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22lowest+bridging+point%22&amp;dq=%22lowest+bridging+point%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g6kLU7-uG8P17AappICgBA&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBw  Andrew White, ''Lancaster: a history'', Phillimore, 2003, p.125]&lt;/ref&gt; [[York]], the lowest bridging point on the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|Ouse]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SnNmAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT46&amp;dq=%22lowest+bridging+point%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZaoLU7jPIOPd7QaC9YHAAw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lowest%20bridging%20point%22&amp;f=false  D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5661">'''Niehues''' is a [[German language|German]] [[toponymic surname]], i.e. it has its source in the type of residence the family lived in.  

{{TOC left}}

== Etymology and pronunciation ==

The name Niehues [[etymology|etymologically]] comes from [[West Low German]] (here: [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]]) dialects, being a [[compound word]] meaning "new house" (the [[High German]] variant of the name is [[Neuhaus (disambiguation)|Neuhaus]]).

The [[pronunciation]] of the name ({{IPA-de|ˈniːhuːs}}) does not entirely follow High German pronunciation rules. The second [[vowel]] sound is written like the alternative High German spelling of an [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]]-''ü'' sound ({{IPA-de|yː}}), but it is pronounced like a normal ''u'' sound ({{IPA-de|uː}}, as in [[English language|English]] ''pool'').  

Due to the non-standard German origin of the name, it is often misspelled or mispronounced even by Germans, if they are unfamiliar with the dialect.

== Origin and distribution ==

In today's [[Germany]], the name Niehues can be found mostly in the regions where the Westphalian dialect is or was spoken, predominantly in the adjacent cities and districts [[Münster]], [[Coesfeld]], [[Steinfurt]], [[Recklinghausen]], [[Borken (district)|Borken]] and [[Unna]] in the northwest of [[Germany]] close to the border of the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="verwandt.de" /&gt;

Outside of Germany, families named Niehues settled especially in the [[United States]] (here predominantly in [[Kansas]], also in [[Texas]], [[California]], [[Louisiana]] and [[Ohio]])&lt;ref name="ancestry.com1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="namespedia.com2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ancestry.com2" /&gt; and in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name="namespedia.com" /&gt;

== People ==

* [[Alfonso Niehues]], [[Brazil|Brazilian]] former arch[[bishop]] at the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Florianópolis]], Brazil
* [[Franz-Josef Niehues]], [[mayor]] of the [[municipality]] [[Rosendahl]], near [[Coesfeld]], Germany 
* [[James Niehues]], [[Americans|American]] resort and panoramic illustrator
* [[Leandro Niehues]], former Brazilian [[soccer]] coach of [[Clube Atlético Paranaense]]
* [[Maximilian Schulze Niehues]], German soccer player currently playing for [[Preußen Münster]] (*1988)
* [[Stefan Niehues]], German [[freelance]] [[wargaming]] [[miniature figure (gaming)|miniature figure]] designer, has worked also for [[Wyrd (company)|Wyrd Miniatures]]

== Places ==

In Germany, some place names are derived from farms bearing the (sometimes former) owner's name, for example Niehues near [[Nottuln]].&lt;ref name="Nottuln" /&gt; Also streets have been named after people named Niehues in Germany (e.g. [[Provost (religion)|Propst]]-Niehues-Straße in [[Marl]],&lt;ref name="Marl" /&gt; Niehuesstraße in [[Everswinkel]]&lt;ref name="Everswinkel" /&gt;), the Netherlands (e.g. Abraham Niehuesstraat in [[Hoogeveen]]&lt;ref name="Hoogeveen" /&gt;) and Brazil (e.g. Rua João Teodoro Niehues in [[Braço do Norte]]&lt;ref name="Braco" /&gt;), and Rua Antonio Niehues in {[Capanema - PR]}.

The area surrounding the piece, a former [[gravel pit]] overlooking the [[Kent Valley]] outside of Seattle,{{sfn|Center for Land Use Interpretation|2017}} has rapidly filled in with urban growth, leading to efforts to both protect it and to enhance public access and enjoyment. The earthwork was the result of a [[King County, Washington|King County]] government symposium titled ''Earthworks: Land Reclamation as Sculpture''. The same symposium also gave impetus to the creation of ''[[Mill Creek Canyon Earthworks]]''.{{sfn|4Culture|2017}}{{sfn|King County King County Archives|2013}} According to the former director of public art for the city and county, the two pieces are the major earthworks in King County;{{sfn|McDonald|2014}} according to [[4Culture]], the piece is of "international importance".{{sfn|4Culture|2017}}

'''Rocco Louis Gentilcore''' (born [[Welland]], [[Canada]], 1924; died [[Hamilton, Ontario]], Canada, 1993) was a professor of [[geography]] at [[McMaster University]], in [[Hamilton, Canada]]. His research was on the historical geography of Canada, in particular settlement development in eastern Canada during the nineteenth century. He edited the second volume of the ''Historical Atlas of Canada'', a three-volume collaborative research and publishing project, undertaken by [[University of Toronto Press]] and finished in 1993, which used maps, text and other graphics to explore themes in the history of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalatlas.ca/website/hacolp/|title=Historical Atlas|last=|first=|date=|website=Historicalatlas.ca|access-date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 the ‘R. Louis Gentilcore Prize’ was established on the occasion of his retirement from the Department of Geography, McMaster University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcgs.org/awards/gold_medal/previous_winners.asp|title=Gold Medal: Past Recipients - The Royal Canadian Geographical Society|website=Rcgs.org|access-date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1994 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the [[Royal Canadian Geographical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science.mcmaster.ca/geo/undergraduate/scholarships.html|title=SGES: Scholarships &amp; Awards|website=Science.mcmaster.ca|access-date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[David Gentilcore]] is a historian at the [[University of Leicester]].

'''Roundness''' is the degree of smoothing due to [[Abrasion (geology)|abrasion]] of sedimentary particles. It is expressed as the ratio of the average radius of curvature of the edges or corners to the radius of curvature of the maximum inscribed sphere.

==Measure of roundness==
[[File:Rounding &amp; sphericity EN.svg|thumb|300px|Schematic representation of difference in grain shape. Two parameters are shown: [[sphericity]] (vertical) and rounding (horizontal).]]
Rounding, roundness or angularity are terms used to describe the shape of the corners on a particle (or [[clast]]) of [[sediment]].&lt;ref name=Folk1965&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a particle may be a grain of [[sand]], a [[pebble]], [[Cobble (geology)|cobble]] or [[boulder]]. Although roundness can be numerically quantified, for practical reasons [[geologist]]s typically use a simple visual chart with up to six categories of roundness:

*Very angular: corners sharp and jagged
*Angular
*Sub-angular
*Sub-rounded
*Rounded
*Well-rounded: corners completely rounded

This six-fold category characterisation is used in the Shepard and Young comparison chart and the Powers chart but the Krumbein chart has nine categories.
 
Rounding of sediment particles can indicate the distance and time involved {{Citation needed|reason=Geologists generally don't use this to indicate time, specific example should be used=October 2016|date=October 2016}} in the [[Transportation (sediment)|transportation]] of the sediment from the source area to where it is [[Deposition (sediment)|deposited]].

Speed of rounding will depend on composition, [[Mohs hardness|hardness]] and mineral [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]]. For example, a soft [[claystone]] pebble will obviously round much faster, and over a shorter distance of transport, than a more resistant [[quartz]] pebble. The rate of rounding is also affected by the [[Particle size|grain size]] and energy conditions.

Angularity (A) and roundness (R) are but two parameters of the complexity of a clast's generalised form (F). A defining expression is given by:

F=f(Sh, A, R, Sp, T) where f denotes a functional relationship between these terms and where Sh denotes the shape, Sp the [[sphericity]] and T the micro-scale surface texture.&lt;ref&gt;Whalley, W.B. Surface textures. (2003) In, Encyclopedia of Sediments and Sedimantary rocks, Ed. G.V. Middleton, Kluwer, p.712-717&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this practical use has been applied to the roundness of the grains in the Gulf of Mexico in order to observe the distance from the source rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasper-Zubillaga|first=et al.|date=2016|title=Provenance of opaque minerals in coastal sands, western Gulf of Mexico, Mexico|url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/6802/(10)Kasper.pdf|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana|volume=68 |issue=2|pages= 323–338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abrasion==
Abrasion occurs in natural environments such as [[beach]]es, [[sand dune]]s, [[river]] or stream beds by the action of current flow, wave impact, [[glacial]] action, wind, gravitational [[Downhill creep|creep]] and other [[erosion|erosive agents]].

==Paleogeographic value of determining the degree of roundness of clastic material==
Roundness is an important indicator of the genetic affiliation of a [[clastic rock]]. The degree of roundness points to the range and mode of transport of clastic material, and can also serve as a search criterion in mineral exploration, especially for [[placer deposit]]s.

[[Alluvium|Alluvial debris]] in major rivers tend to exhibit a high degree of roundness. Alluvium from small rivers is less rounded. Deposits of ephemeral streams exhibit little rounding with angular clasts.

==Clast rounding in non-sedimentary environments==

[[Pebble dike]]s are dikelike bodies found in intrusive environments which contain variably rounded fragments. The clasts originate in deeper formations and have been brought up by [[diatreme]] or intrusive [[breccia]]s. The fragments have been rounded due to either ''milling'' action or corrosion by [[hydrothermal]] fluids.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Robert L. and Julia A. Jackson, eds., ''Dictionary of geological terms,'' Anchor, 3rd ed. 1984, p. 372 {{ISBN|978-0-385-18101-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guilbert&gt;Guilbert, John M. and Charles F. Park, Jr., ''The Geology of Ore Deposits,'' Freeman, 1986, pp.83-85 {{ISBN|0-7167-1456-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ore deposits of [[Tintic mining district]], [[Utah]]; [[Ouray, Colorado]]; [[Silver Bell Mine, Arizona|Silver Bell]]; and [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]], [[Arizona]] and the [[Kiruna]] iron deposit in [[Sweden]] contain these pebble dikes.&lt;ref name=Guilbert/&gt;

'''''Siek''''' is a north German term for a wet depression, hollow or lowland area. It is mainly used to describe typical cultural landscape elements in eastern [[Westphalia]], especially in the county of [[Kreis Lippe|Lippe]] and in the region of [[Ravensberg Land]]. In [[East Westphalia]] "siek" is a very common component of the names of tracts of land, roads, places and even personal names, e.g. ''Heidsiek'', ''Siekhorst'', ''Im Siek'', ''Siekmann'' and ''[[Sieker (Bielefeld)|Sieker]]''.

== Origins ==
The fertile [[loess]] soils in this region of north Germany are dissected by a host of brooks and headstreams, which used to flow in marshy [[V-shaped valley]]s. Not all ''Sieke'' are or were, however, crossed by a stream, but at the very least they always consisted of wet ground. During the course of [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] cultural and agricultural history, people developed these natural landforms by cutting into the edges of the V-shaped valleys (so-called ''Wiesenbrechen'' by [[Wiesenmacher|''Wiskenmaker'']] &lt;ref&gt;Adolf Schüttler: ''Das Ravensberger Land''. Aschendorff, Münster 1995, S. 13, {{ISBN|3-402-06348-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and turning them into [[trough valley|trough]] and [[box valley]]s, and any streams were regulated such that they ran in straight beds along the edges of such a box valley. The aim of these measures was the create a wet [[grassland]] in the now broad, accessible stream meadows which could then be extensively cultivated. In addition the cut, grass sods or ''[[plaggen]]'' were able to be used to fertilise the surrounding fields (''[[Plaggendüngung]]''). In Ravensberg Land, ''sieke'' are generally narrow, trough valleys interspersed in the countryside and lying next to cultivated areas of slightly higher ground or ''[[kuppe]]n'' (''[[Plaggenesch]]e''), which were raised by the grass sod fertilisation.

== Importance today ==
Since, owing to the changed production conditions in modern agriculture, the grasslands in the ''sieken'' have become economically largely superfluous, many unused ''sieke'' would become marshy again in the long term without [[mowing]] and maintenance and turn into [[black alder]] [[carr (landform)|carrs]]. Conservation and cultural landscape management today have the task of ensuring a balanced relationship between renaturalising ''sieken'' on the one hand and regularly mown grassland ''sieken'' on the other. An example of protected ''siek'' systems is the [[Kilverbach]] valley ({{Coordinate|text=ICON0|NS=52.228667|EW=8.461318|type=landmark|region=DE-NW|name=Kilverbachsiek}}) and the [[Wöhrener Siek]] in Ravensberg Land.

== ''Siepen'' ==
Etymologically probably related and conceptually similar is the valley landform known as a''[[siepen]]'', which is mainly found in the south Westphalian area and generally also describes wet valley bottoms, mostly stream-bearing V-shaped valleys.

Rwanda is divided into [[Provinces of Rwanda|five provinces]] ({{lang|rw|intara}}) and subdivided into [[Districts of Rwanda|thirty districts]] ({{lang|rw|akarere}}). 

== Provinces ==
{{main|Provinces of Rwanda}}
Rwanda's provinces are:
* [[Northern Province, Rwanda|Northern Province]]
* [[Eastern Province, Rwanda|Eastern Province]]
* [[Southern Province, Rwanda|Southern Province]]
* [[Western Province, Rwanda|Western Province]]
* [[Kigali Province, Rwanda|Kigali Province]]

Prior to 1 January 2006, Rwanda was composed of twelve provinces (known as prefectures up to 2001), but these were abolished in full and redrawn as part of a program of decentralization and reorganization.

The '''Suez Canal''' ({{lang-ar|قناة السويس}} ''{{transl|arz|ALA|qanāt as-suwēs}}'') is a [[sea-level]] [[waterway]] in [[Egypt]], connecting the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[Red Sea]] through the [[Isthmus of Suez]]. Constructed by the [[Suez Canal Company]] between 1859 and 1869, it was officially opened on 17 November 1869. The [[canal]] offers [[watercraft]] a shorter journey between the [[Atlantic Ocean#NORTH ATLANTIC|North Atlantic]] and northern [[Indian Ocean]]s via the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Red Sea]]s by avoiding the South Atlantic and southern Indian Oceans, reducing the journey by approximately {{convert|6000|km}}{{Citation needed|reason=This number needs to be supported by a reliable source.|date=November 2018}}. It extends from the northern terminus of [[Port Said]] to the southern terminus of [[Port Tewfik]] at the city of [[Suez]]. Its length is {{convert|193.30|km|mi|abbr=on}}, including its northern and southern access channels. In 2012, 17,225 vessels traversed the canal (average 47 per day).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/TRstat.aspx?reportId=3 |title= Yearly Number &amp; Net Tone by Ship Type, Direction &amp; Ship Status | date=  | publisher= Suez Canal | location=  | accessdate= 23 Apr 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215214021/http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/TRstat.aspx?reportId=3| archivedate=2010-02-15|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original canal was a single-lane waterway with passing locations in the Ballah Bypass and the [[Great Bitter Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg Suez Canal Authority]&lt;/ref&gt; It contains no [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] system, with seawater flowing freely through it. In general, the canal north of the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer. South of the lakes, the current changes with the [[tide]] at Suez.&lt;ref name = rsp&gt;{{cite book|title=The Red Sea Pilot|publisher=Imray Laurie Norie &amp; Wilson|year=1995|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The canal is owned and maintained by the [[Suez Canal Authority]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= |title=Official Web Site of the Suez Canal Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt; (SCA) of Egypt. Under the [[Convention of Constantinople]], it may be used "in time of war as in time of peace, by every vessel of commerce or of war, without distinction of flag".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:en:Constantinople Convention of the Suez Canal|Constantinople Convention of the Suez Canal of 2 March 1888]] still in force and specifically maintained in Nasser's Nationalization Act.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, construction was launched to expand and widen the Ballah Bypass for {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} to speed the canal's transit time. The expansion was planned to double the capacity of the Suez Canal from 49 to 97 ships a day.&lt;ref name="SuezExpansion"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Suez Canal project proposed by Egypt to boost trade|url=http://www.caironews.net/index.php/sid/224460353|accessdate=7 August 2014|publisher=''Cairo News.Net''}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a cost of [[United States dollar|$]]8.4 billion, this project was funded with [[Sukuk|interest-bearing investment certificates]] issued exclusively to Egyptian entities and individuals. The "[[New Suez Canal]]", as the expansion was dubbed, was opened with great fanfare in a ceremony on 6 August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1531052/egypt-opens-new-6bn-suez-canal|title=Egypt Opens New £6bn Suez Canal|first=Sherine|last=Tadros|agency=Sky News|date=6 August 2015|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 February 2016, the Suez Canal Authority officially opened the new side channel. This side channel, located at the northern side of the east extension of the Suez Canal, serves the East Terminal for berthing and unberthing vessels from the terminal.  As the East Container Terminal is located on the Canal itself, before the construction of the new side channel it was not possible to berth or unberth vessels at the terminal while the convoy was running.&lt;ref name="MyUser_News.xinhuanet.com_March_12_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-02/25/c_135128152.htm |title=Egypt opens East Port Said side channel for navigation - Xinhua |newspaper=News.xinhuanet.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= 12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legendary [[Sesostris]] (likely either [[Pharaoh]] Senusret II or [[Senusret III]] of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt]]&lt;ref name="Sesostris" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[J. H. Breasted]] attributes the ancient canal's early construction to [[Senusret III]], up through the first cataract. Please refer to J. H. Breasted, ''[[Ancient Records of Egypt]]'', Part One, Chicago 1906, §§642–648&lt;/ref&gt;) may have started work on an ancient canal joining the Nile with the Red Sea (1897 BCE – 1839 BCE), when an irrigation channel was constructed around 1850 BCE that was navigable during the flood season, leading into a dry river valley east of the Nile River Delta named [[Wadi Tumilat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=William B.|last2=Smith|first2=Charles Gordon|title=Suez Canal|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Suez-Canal|website=www.britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (It is said that in [[Ancient history|ancient times]] the Red Sea reached northward to the [[Bitter Lakes]]&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt; and [[Lake Timsah]].&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition, s.v.

In his ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'', [[Aristotle]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of their kings tried to make a canal to it (for it would have been of no little advantage to them for the whole region to have become navigable; Sesostris is said to have been the first of the ancient kings to try), but he found that the sea was higher than the land. So he first, and [[Darius the Great|Darius]] afterwards, stopped making the canal, lest the sea should mix with the river water and spoil it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/meteorology/book1.html |title='''Meteorology''' (1.15) |publisher=Ebooks.adelaide.edu.au |date=25 August 2010 |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Strabo]] wrote that Sesostris started to build a canal, and [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;165. Next comes the [[Tyro]] tribe and, the harbour of the [[Daneoi]], from which Sesostris, king of Egypt, intended to carry a ship-canal to where the Nile flows into what is known as [[Nile Delta|the Delta]]; this is a distance of over 60 miles. Later the Persian king Darius had the same idea, and yet again [[Ptolemy II]], who made a trench 100 feet wide, 30 feet deep and about 35 miles long, as far as the Bitter Lakes.&lt;ref&gt;The Elder Pliny and John Healey ''Natural History'' (6.33.165) Penguin Classics; Reprint edition (5 February 2004) {{ISBN|978-0-14-044413-1}} p.&amp;nbsp;70 [https://books.google.com/books?id=JvyF-8NXFbIC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=Pliny+the+elder+sesostris+canal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t1np0DY4S3&amp;sig=i0wzXRGizdz6DK8e6CTGA1wFcoI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BieVSv3GE-PKjAfU-OnnDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the second half of the 19th century, French [[cartographer]]s discovered the remnants of an ancient north–south canal past the east side of [[Lake Timsah]] and ending near the north end of the Great Bitter Lake.&lt;ref name="Carte hydrographique"&gt;''Carte hydrographique de l'Basse Egypte et d'une partie de l'Isthme de Suez'' (1855, 1882).

(This ancient, second canal may have followed a course along the shoreline of the Red Sea when it once extended north to Lake Timsah.&lt;ref name="Naville" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carte hydrographique" /&gt;) In the 20th century the northward extension of this ancient canal was discovered, extending from Lake Timsah to the [[Ballah Lakes]].&lt;ref name="WShea"&gt;Shea, William H.

Remnants of an ancient west–east canal through the [[ancient Egypt]]ian cities of [[Bubastis]], [[Avaris|Pi-Ramesses]], and [[Pithom]] were discovered by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and his engineers and cartographers in 1799.&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fj0GAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA351&amp;lpg=RA2-PA351&amp;dq=Gratien+Le+P%C3%A8re&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h-ZAEgY_yZ&amp;sig=2vmD6bS3Cj-XwCRdc_uLueFseXQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6blFStHdO8PdsgaKxaQs&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9  ''Descriptions de l'Égypte'', Volume 11 (État Moderne)], containing ''Mémoire sur la communication de la mer des Indes à la Méditerranée par la mer Rouge et l'Isthme de Sueys'', par M.

According to the ''[[The Histories of Herodotus|Histories]]'' of the [[Greeks|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus ii.158.&lt;/ref&gt; about 600&amp;nbsp;BCE, [[Necho II]] undertook to dig a west–east canal through the Wadi Tumilat between Bubastis and [[Pithom|Heroopolis]],&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt; and perhaps continued it to the [[Heroopolite Gulf]] and the Red Sea.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Regardless, Necho is reported as having never completed his project.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt;

Herodotus was told that 120,000 men perished in this undertaking, but this figure is doubtless exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;"The figure ‘120,000’ is doubtless exaggerated. [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mehemet Ali]] lost only 10,000 in making the Mahmûdieh Canal (from the Nile to Alexandria)." remarked W. W. How and J. Wells, ''A Commentary on Herodotus''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pliny the Elder]], Necho's extension to the canal was about 57 English miles,&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt; equal to the total distance between Bubastis and the Great Bitter Lake, allowing for winding through [[valley]]s.&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt; The length that Herodotus tells, of over 1000 [[Stadia (length)|stadia]] (i.e., over {{convert|114|mi|km}}), must be understood to include the entire distance between the Nile and the Red Sea&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt; at that time.

With Necho's death, work was discontinued. Herodotus tells that the reason the project was abandoned was because of a warning received from an [[oracle]] that others would benefit from its successful completion.&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Herodotus, work on the project was "stayed by a prophetic utterance that he [Necho] was toiling beforehand for the barbarian. The Egyptians call all men of other languages [[barbarian]]s." (Herodotus, ''eo. loc.''.)&lt;/ref&gt; Necho's war with [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] most probably prevented the canal's continuation.

Necho's project was completed by [[Darius I of Persia]], who ruled over [[Ancient Egypt]] after it had been conquered by his predecessor [[Cambyses II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/90718/Cambyses-II|title=Cambyses II - king of Persia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that by Darius's time a natural&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt; waterway passage which had existed&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; between the Heroopolite Gulf and the Red Sea&lt;ref name="location"&gt;Apparently, [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]] considered the Great Bitter Lake as a northern extension of the Red Sea, whereas Darius had not, because [[Arsinoe (Gulf of Suez)|Arsinoe]] is located north of Shaluf. (See Naville, "Map of the Wadi Tumilat", referenced above.)&lt;/ref&gt; in the vicinity of the Egyptian town of Shaluf&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt; (alt. ''Chalouf''&lt;ref&gt;Please refer to [[Darius the Great's Suez Inscriptions]].&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Shaloof''&lt;ref name="Naville"/&gt;), located just south of the Great Bitter Lake,&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Naville" /&gt; had become so blocked&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; with [[silt]]&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt; that Darius needed to clear it out so as to allow [[navigation]]&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt; once again. According to Herodotus, Darius's canal was wide enough that two [[trireme]]s could pass each other with oars extended, and required four days to traverse. Darius commemorated his achievement with a number of [[granite]] [[stela]]e that he set up on the Nile bank, including one near Kabret, and a further one a few miles north of [[Suez]].

=== Receding Red Sea and the dwindling Nile ===
The Red Sea is believed by some historians to have gradually receded over the centuries, its coastline slowly moving southward away from [[Lake Timsah]]&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Naville" /&gt; and the Great Bitter Lake.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt; Coupled with persistent accumulations of Nile [[silt]], maintenance and repair of Ptolemy's canal became increasingly cumbersome over each passing century.

Two hundred years after the construction of Ptolemy's canal, [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]] seems to have had no west–east waterway passage,&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt; because the [[Pelusiac branch]] of the Nile, which fed Ptolemy's west–east canal, had by that time dwindled, being choked with silt.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt;

=== Old Cairo to the Red Sea ===
By the 8th century, a navigable canal existed between [[Old Cairo]] and the Red Sea,&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt; but accounts vary as to who ordered its construction—either [[Trajan]] or [['Amr ibn al-'As]], or [[Umar|Omar the Great]].&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt; This canal was reportedly linked to the River Nile at Old Cairo&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt; and ended near modern [[Suez]].&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[August Heinrich Petermann|Petermann, A.]] ''Karte Der Bai Von Súes'' (1856). Nach der Engl. Aufnahme v. Comm. Mansell.&lt;/ref&gt; A geography [[treatise]] by Dicuil reports a conversation with an English monk, Fidelis, who had sailed on the canal from the Nile to the Red Sea during a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in the first half of the 8th century&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Tuchman|Tuchman, Barbara]] ''Bible and Sword: How the British came to Palestine'' MacMillan, London (1987) {{ISBN|0-333-33414-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] is said to have ordered this canal closed in 767 to prevent supplies from reaching [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian]] detractors.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt;

=== Repair by al-Ḥākim ===
[[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] is claimed to have repaired the Cairo to Red Sea passageway,&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt; but only briefly, circa 1000 AD,&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt; as it soon "became choked with sand".&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt; However, we are told that parts of this canal still continued to fill in during the Nile's annual inundations.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rappoport" /&gt;

=== Conception by Venice ===
The successful 1488 navigation of southern Africa by [[Bartolomeu Dias]] opened a direct maritime [[trading route to India]] and the spice islands, and forever changed the balance of Mediterranean trade. One of the most prominent losers in the new order, as former middlemen, was the former spice trading center of [[Venice]].

{{Quotation|Venetian leaders, driven to desperation, contemplated digging a waterway between the Red Sea and the Nile—anticipating the Suez Canal by almost 400 years—to bring the luxury trade flooding to their doors again. But this remained a dream.|Colin Thubron, ''Seafarers: The Venetians'' (1980), p. 102}}

Despite entering negotiations with Egypt's ruling Mamelukes, the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] plan to build the canal was quickly put to rest by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–17)|conquest of Egypt in 1517]], led by Sultan [[Selim I]].&lt;ref&gt;Starthern, P (2013) "The Venetians" p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ottoman attempts === 

During the 16th century, the Ottoman [[Grand Vizier]] [[Sokollu Mehmed Pasha]] attempted to construct a canal connecting the [[Red Sea]] and the Mediterranean. This was motivated by a desire to connect [[Constantinople]] to the [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] and [[trade routes]] of the [[Indian Ocean]], as well as by strategic concerns -- as the European presence in the Indian Ocean was growing, Ottoman mercantile and strategic interests were [[Ottoman-Portuguese confrontations|increasingly challenged]], and the [[Sublime Porte]] was increasingly pressed to [[Ottoman naval expeditions in the Indian Ocean|assert its position]]. A navigable canal would allow the [[Ottoman Navy]] to connect its [[Red Sea]], [[Black Sea]], and [[Mediterranean Sea|White Sea]] fleets. However, this project was deemed too expensive, and was never completed.&lt;ref&gt; Ortega, Stephen (2012). "The Ottoman Age of Exploration".

=== Napoleon's discovery of an ancient canal ===
During the [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria]] in late 1798, [[Napoleon]] showed an interest in finding the remnants of an ancient waterway passage. This culminated in a cadre of [[archaeologist]]s, scientists, [[cartographer]]s and engineers scouring northern Egypt.&lt;ref name="Linda Hall"&gt;{{cite book|first=Linda|last= Hall|publisher=Kansas City, Missouri|URL=http://www.lhl.lib.mo.us/events_exhib/exhibit/exhibits/napoleon/suez_canal.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214040954/http://www.lhl.lib.mo.us/events_exhib/exhibit/exhibits/napoleon/suez_canal.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-02-14|title=The Search for the Ancient Suez Canal}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Please refer to [[Description de l'Égypte]].&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings, recorded in the ''[[Description de l'Égypte]]'', include detailed maps that depict the discovery of an ancient canal extending northward from the Red Sea and then westward toward the Nile.&lt;ref name="Linda Hall" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fj0GAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA351&amp;lpg=RA2-PA351&amp;dq=Gratien+Le+P%C3%A8re&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h-ZAEgY_yZ&amp;sig=2vmD6bS3Cj-XwCRdc_uLueFseXQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6blFStHdO8PdsgaKxaQs&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9  ''Descriptions de l'Égypte'', Volume 11 (État Moderne)], containing ''Mémoire sur la communication de la mer des Indes à la Méditerranée par la mer Rouge et l'Isthme de Sueys'',

Later, Napoleon, who would become French Emperor in 1804, contemplated the construction of a north–south canal to connect the Mediterranean with the Red Sea. But the plan was abandoned because it wrongly concluded that the waterway would require locks to operate. These would be very expensive and take a long time to construct. This decision was based on an erroneous belief that the Red Sea was {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} higher than the Mediterranean. The error was the result of using fragmentary survey measurements taken in wartime during Napoleon's Egyptian Expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Suez Canal''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819 the Pacha of Egypt undertook some canal work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=26 February 1820 |title=[untitled] |at=p. 2, col. 1.|work=The Hobart Town Gazette |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article657661 |accessdate=4 May 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as late as 1861, the unnavigable ancient route discovered by Napoleon from [[Bubastis]] to the Red Sea still channeled water in spots as far east as [[Kassassin]].&lt;ref name="Rappoport"/&gt;

=== Interim period ===
[[File:Suez1856.jpg|thumb|[[Bathymetric chart]], northern [[Gulf of Suez]], route to [[Old Cairo|Cairo]], 1856]]

Although the alleged difference in sea levels could be problematic for construction, the idea of finding a shorter route to the east remained alive. In 1830, [[Francis Rawdon Chesney|F. R. Chesney]] submitted a report to the British government that stated that there was no difference in elevation and that the Suez Canal was feasible, but his report received no further attention. [[Thomas Fletcher Waghorn|Lieutenant Waghorn]] established his "Overland Route", which transported post and passengers to India via Egypt. [[Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds|Linant de Bellefonds]], a French explorer of Egypt, became chief engineer of [[Egyptian Public Works|Egypt's Public Works]]. In addition to his normal duties, he surveyed the [[Isthmus of Suez]] and made plans for the Suez Canal. French [[Saint-Simonianism|Saint-Simonianists]] showed an interest in the canal and in 1833, [[Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin]] tried to draw [[Muhammad Ali Pasha|Muhammad Ali's]] attention to the canal but was unsuccessful. [[Alois Negrelli]], the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] railroad pioneer, became interested in the idea in 1836. In 1846, Prosper Enfantin's [[Société d'Études du Canal de Suez]] invited a number of experts, among them [[Robert Stephenson]], Negrelli and [[Paul-Adrien Bourdaloue]] to study the feasibility of the Suez Canal (with the assistance of Linant de Bellefonds). Bourdaloue's survey of the isthmus was the first generally accepted evidence that there was no practical difference in altitude between the two seas. Britain, however, feared that a canal open to everyone might interfere with its [[British Raj|India]] trade and therefore preferred a connection by train from [[Alexandria]] via [[Cairo]] to Suez, which was eventually built by Stephenson.

===Construction by the Suez Canal Company===

====Preparations (1854-1858)====
In 1854 and 1856, [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] obtained a concession from [[Sa'id of Egypt|Sa'id Pasha]], the [[Khedive]] of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt and Sudan]], to create a company to construct a canal open to ships of all nations. The company was to operate the canal for 99 years from its opening. De Lesseps had used his friendly relationship with Sa'id, which he had developed while he was a French diplomat in the 1830s. As stipulated in the concessions, Ferdinand convened the [[International Commission for the piercing of the isthmus of Suez]] (''Commission Internationale pour le percement de l'isthme des Suez'') consisting of 13 experts from seven countries, among them [[John Robinson McClean]], later President of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] in London, and again Negrelli, to examine the plans developed by [[Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds|Linant de Bellefonds]], and to advise on the feasibility of and the best route for the canal. After surveys and analyses in Egypt and discussions in Paris on various aspects of the canal, where many of Negrelli's ideas prevailed, the commission produced a unanimous report in December 1856 containing a detailed description of the canal complete with plans and profiles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LVoGEq7EwxMC&amp;pg=PA377 ''Percement de l'isthme de Suez. Rapport et Projet de la Commission Internationale''. Documents Publiés par M. Ferdinand de Lesseps.] Troisième série. Paris aux bureaux de l'Isthme de Suez, Journal de l'Union des deux Mers, et chez Henri Plon, Éditeur, 1856. On Google Books (french)&lt;/ref&gt; The Suez Canal Company (''[[Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez]]'') came into being on 15 December 1858.

====Construction (1859-1869)====
Work started on the shore of the future Port Said on 25 April 1859.

[[File:Suez Canal drawing 1881.jpg|thumb|upright|1881 drawing of the Suez Canal]]

The excavation took some 10 years using [[forced labour]] ([[corvée]]) of Egyptian workers during the first years. Some sources estimate that over 30,000 people were working on the canal at any given period, that more than 1.5 million people from various countries were employed, and that thousands of labourers died, many of them from cholera and similar epidemics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/suezcanal032262mbp Arnold. T. Wilson, ''The Suez Canal'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arte.tv/fr/connaissance-decouverte/aventure-humaine/Cette_20semaine/1291022.html |title=Le canal de Suez – ARTE |publisher=Arte.tv |date=13 August 2006 |accessdate=24 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819201458/http://www.arte.tv/fr/connaissance-decouverte/aventure-humaine/Cette_20semaine/1291022.html |archivedate=19 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British government had opposed the project from the outset to its completion. As one of the diplomatic moves against the canal, it disapproved of the use of "slave labour" of forced workers. The [[British Empire]] was the major global naval force and officially condemned the forced work and sent armed [[Bedouin]]s to start a revolt among workers. Involuntary labour on the project ceased, and the viceroy condemned the corvée, halting the project.&lt;ref&gt;Oster (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Angered by the British opportunism, de Lesseps sent a letter to the British government remarking on the British lack of remorse a few years earlier when forced workers died in similar conditions building the British railway in Egypt.

Initially international opinion was skeptical and Suez Canal Company shares did not sell well overseas. Britain, [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] did not buy a significant number of shares. However, with assistance from the Cattaui banking family, and their relationship with [[James Mayer de Rothschild|James de Rothschild]] of the [[Rothschild banking family of France|French House of Rothschild]] bonds and shares were successfully promoted in France and other parts of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;There is differing information on the exact amounts&lt;/ref&gt; All French shares were quickly sold in France. A contemporary British skeptic claimed "One thing is sure... our local merchant community doesn't pay practical attention at all to this grand work, and it is legitimate to doubt that the canal's receipts... could ever be sufficient to recover its maintenance fee. It will never become a large ship's accessible way in any case."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arte.tv/fr/connaissance-decouverte/aventure-humaine/Cette_20semaine/1291022.html (reported by German historian Uwe A. Oster)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819201458/http://www.arte.tv/fr/connaissance-decouverte/aventure-humaine/Cette_20semaine/1291022.html |date=19 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inauguration (17 November 1869)===
[[File:Suez Canal, Egypt. Lantern Slide.jpg|thumb|left|Suez Canal, Egypt. early 1900s. Goodyear Archival Collection. [[Brooklyn Museum]] ]]

The canal opened under French control on 17 November 1869. The opening was performed by [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha]] of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt and Sudan]], and at Ismail's invitation [[Eugénie de Montijo|French Empress Eugenie]] in the Imperial yacht ''L'Aigle'' piloted by Napoléon Coste, upon whom the [[Khedivate of Egypt|Khedive]] bestowed the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Order of the Medjidie]].

Although ''L'Aigle'' was officially the first vessel through the canal, [[HMS Newport (1867)|HMS ''Newport'']], captained by [[George Nares]], passed through it first. On the night before the canal was due to open, Captain Nares navigated his vessel, in total darkness and without lights, through the mass of waiting ships until it was in front of ''L'Aigle''. When dawn broke, the French were horrified to find that the [[Royal Navy]] was first in line and that it would be impossible to pass them. Nares received both an official reprimand and an unofficial vote of thanks from the [[Admiralty]] for his actions in promoting British interests and for demonstrating such superb seamanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The People: Captain Nares|url=http://aquarium.ucsd.edu/Education/Learning_Resources/Challenger/people1.php|work=HMS Challenger|publisher=University of California, San Diego|accessdate=30 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009025658/http://aquarium.ucsd.edu/Education/Learning_Resources/Challenger/people1.php|archivedate=9 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial difficulties (1869-1871)===
Although numerous technical, political, and financial problems had been overcome, the [[Cost overrun|final cost]] was more than double the original estimate.

The Khedive, in particular, was able to overcome initial reservations held by both British and French creditors by enlisting the help of the [[Sursock family]], whose deep connections proved invaluable in securing much international support for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Kassir |first= Samir |title= Beirut, First Edition |access-date=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the opening, the Suez Canal Company was in financial difficulties. The remaining works were completed only in 1871, and traffic was below expectations in the first two years. De Lesseps therefore tried to increase revenues by interpreting the kind of net ton referred to in the second concession (''tonneau de capacité'') as meaning a ship's cargo capacity and not only the theoretical [[net tonnage]] of the "[[Moorsom System]]" introduced in Britain by the Merchant Shipping Act in 1854. The ensuing commercial and diplomatic activities resulted in the International Commission of Constantinople establishing a specific kind of net tonnage and settling the question of tariffs in its protocol of 18 December 1873.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/documentsdiplom21trgoog#page/n125/mode/1up Protocol of the Commission] (in french)&lt;/ref&gt; This was the origin of the [[Net Register Tonnage|Suez Canal Net Tonnage]] and the [[Net Register Tonnage|Suez Canal Special Tonnage Certificate]], both of which are still in use today.

=== Company rule after opening ===
[[File:Suez Canal (ca 1914).jpg|thumb|Suez Canal, ca 1914]]

The canal had an immediate and dramatic effect on [[Global trade|world trade]]. Combined with the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|American transcontinental railroad]] completed six months earlier, it allowed the world to be circled in record time. It played an important role in increasing [[European colonization of Africa]]. The construction of the canal was one of the reasons for the [[Panic of 1873]], because goods from the Far East were carried in sailing vessels around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and were stored in British warehouses.  An inability to pay his bank debts led Said Pasha's successor, [[Isma'il Pasha]], to sell his 44% share in the canal  for £4,000,000 (about £{{Inflation|US|4|1875|r=1}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) to the government of Great Britain in 1875. French shareholders still held the majority. &lt;ref&gt; Geoffrey Hicks, "Disraeli, Derby and the Suez Canal, 1875: some myths reassessed." ''History'' 97.326 (2012): 182-203.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24429312 online] &lt;/ref&gt;  Local unrest caused the British to invade in 1882 and take full control, although nominally Egypt remained part of the Ottoman Empire. The British representative 1883 to 1907 was [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer]], who reorganized and modernized the government and suppressed rebellions and corruption. thereby facilitating increased traffic on the canal.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L.

The [[Convention of Constantinople]] in 1888 declared the canal a neutral zone under the protection of the British, who had occupied Egypt and Sudan at the request of [[Khedive]] [[Tewfik Pasha|Tewfiq]] to suppress the [[Urabi Revolt]] against his rule. The revolt went on from 1879 to 1882. As a result of British involvement on the side of Khedive Tewfiq, Britain gained control of the canal in 1882. The British defended the strategically important passage against a major [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[First Suez Offensive|attack]] in 1915, during the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name="FWW87"&gt;''First World War'' – Willmott, H.P. [[Dorling Kindersley]], 2003, Page 87&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]], the UK retained control over the canal.  The canal was again strategically important in the 1939–1945 [[Second World War]], and Italo-German attempts to capture it were repulsed during the [[North Africa Campaign]], during which the canal was closed to [[Axis powers|Axis]] shipping.  In 1951 Egypt repudiated the treaty and in October 1954 the UK agreed to remove its troops. Withdrawal was completed on 18 July 1956.

=== Suez Crisis ===
{{Main article|Suez Crisis}}
[[File:Port Said from air.jpg|thumb|Smoke rises from oil tanks beside the Suez Canal hit during the initial [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Anglo-French assault]] on [[Port Said]], 5 November 1956]]

Because of Egyptian overtures towards the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] withdrew their pledge to support the construction of the [[Aswan Dam]]. Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] responded by [[nationalizing]] the canal on 26 July 1956&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Suez Canal formally opened to ships|url=http://stratscope.com/the-suez-canal-formally-opened-to-ships/|website=stratscope.com|publisher=StratScope|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transferring it to the [[Suez Canal Authority]], intending to finance the dam project using revenue from the canal. On the same day that the canal was nationalized Nasser also closed the [[Straits of Tiran]] to all Israeli ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/26/newsid_2701000/2701603.stm|title=1956: Egypt seizes Suez Canal|date=26 July 1956|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the [[Suez Crisis]] in which the UK, France, and [[Israel]] invaded Egypt. According to the pre-agreed war plans under the [[Protocol of Sèvres]], the Israelis invaded the [[Sinai Peninsula]] on 29 October, forcing Egypt to engage them militarily, and allowing the [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Anglo-French]] partnership to declare the resultant fighting a threat to stability in the Middle East and enter the war - officially to separate the two forces but in reality to regain the Canal and bring down the Nasser government.

To save the British from what he thought was a disastrous action and to stop the war from a possible escalation, Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs [[Lester B. Pearson]] proposed the creation of the first United Nations peacekeeping force to ensure access to the canal for all and an Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula. On 4 November 1956, a majority at the United Nations voted for Pearson's peacekeeping resolution, which [[Mandate (international law)|mandated]] the UN peacekeepers to stay in Sinai unless both Egypt and Israel agreed to their withdrawal. The United States backed this proposal by putting pressure on the British government through the selling of [[Pound sterling|sterling]], which would cause it to depreciate. Britain then called a ceasefire, and later agreed to withdraw its troops by the end of the year. Pearson was later awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. As a result of damage and ships sunk under orders from Nasser the canal was closed until April 1957, when it was cleared with UN assistance.&lt;ref&gt;''The Other Side of Suez'' (documentary) – 2003&lt;/ref&gt; A UN force ([[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF]]) was established to maintain the free navigability of the canal, and peace in the Sinai Peninsula.

===Arab–Israeli wars of 1967 and 1973===
[[File:Egyptianbridge.jpg|thumb|Egyptian vehicles crossing the Suez Canal on 7 October 1973, during the [[Yom Kippur War]]]]
[[File: Israeli Tanks Cross the Suez Canal - Flickr - Israel Defense Forces.jpg|thumb|Israeli tank crossing the Suez Canal, 1973]]

In May 1967, Nasser ordered the UN peacekeeping forces out of Sinai, including the Suez Canal area. Israel objected to the closing of the [[Straits of Tiran]] to Israeli shipping. The canal had been closed to Israeli shipping since 1949, except for a short period in 1951–1952.

After the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Israeli forces occupied the Sinai peninsula, including the entire east bank of the Suez Canal. Unwilling to allow the Israelis to use the canal, Egypt immediately imposed a blockade which closed the canal to all shipping. 15 cargo ships, known as the "[[Yellow Fleet]]", were trapped in the canal, and would remain there until 1975.

In 1973, during the [[Yom Kippur War]], the canal was the scene of [[Operation Badr (1973)|a major crossing]] by the Egyptian army into Israeli-occupied Sinai and a counter-crossing by the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli army]] to Egypt. Much wreckage from this conflict remains visible along the canal's edges.{{Citation needed |date= July 2009}}

===Mine clearing operations (1974-75)===
After the Yom Kippur War the United States initiated [[Operation Nimbus Moon]]. The [[amphibious assault ship]] [[USS Inchon (LPH-12)|USS ''Inchon (LPH-12)'']] was sent to the Canal, carrying 12 [[CH-53 Sea Stallion|RH-53D]] minesweeping helicopters of [[Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 12|HM-12]]. These partly cleared the canal between May and December 1974. She was relieved by the LST [[USS Barnstable County|USS ''Barnstable County'']] (LST1197). The British [[Royal Navy]] initiated [[Operation Rheostat]] and Task Group 65.2 provided for Operation Rheostat One&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/1060020618|title=OPERATION RHEOSTAT ONE – ROYAL NAVY MINESWEEPERS ARRIVE AT PORT SAID TO HELP CLEAR THE SUEZ CANAL [Allocated Title]|website=www.iwm.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; (six months in 1974), the minehunters [[HMS Maxton|HMS ''Maxton'']], [[HMS Bossington|HMS ''Bossington'']], and [[HMS Wilton (M1116)|HMS ''Wilton'']], the Fleet Clearance Diving Team (FCDT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/1060020621|title=OPERATION RHEOSTAT ONE – FLEET CLEARANCE DIVING TEAM AT WORK ON THE WRECK OF THE MECCA [Allocated Title]|website=www.iwm.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[HMS Abdiel (N21)|HMS ''Abdiel'']], a practice minelayer/MCMV support ship; and for Operation Rheostat Two&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/1060020626|title=OPERATION RHEOSTAT TWO – THE SUEZ CANAL IS REOPENED [Allocated Title] |website=www.iwm.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; (six months in 1975) the minehunters HMS Hubberston and HMS Sheraton, and HMS Abdiel. When the Canal Clearance Operations were completed, the canal and its lakes were considered 99% clear of mines. The canal was then reopened by Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]] aboard an Egyptian destroyer, which led the first convoy northbound to Port Said in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1970s/1974/sep74.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; At his side stood the Iranian Crown Prince [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|Reza Pahlavi]], delegated to represent his father, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammed Reza Pahlavi]], the Shah of Iran. The cruiser [[USS Little Rock (CL-92)|USS ''Little Rock'']] was the only American naval ship in the convoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.usslittlerock.org/Historic%20Events/Little_Rock_Suez_Canal.html |title=The Stars and Stripes |last= |first= |date=1975-06-07 |work= |access-date= |via= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622141419/http://www.usslittlerock.org/Historic%20Events/Little_Rock_Suez_Canal.html |archivedate=22 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UN presence===
The [[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF]] mandate expired in 1979. Despite the efforts of the United States, Israel, Egypt, and others to obtain an extension of the UN role in observing the peace between Israel and Egypt, as called for under the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]] of 1979, the mandate could not be extended because of the veto by the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[UN Security Council]], at the request of [[Syria]]. Accordingly, negotiations for a new observer force in the Sinai produced the [[Multinational Force and Observers]] (MFO), stationed in Sinai in 1981 in coordination with a phased Israeli withdrawal. It is there under agreements between the United States, Israel, Egypt, and other nations.&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.mfo.org/ Multinational Force and Observers])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bypass expansion ===
{{Main article|New Suez Canal}}

In the summer of 2014, months after taking office as [[President of Egypt]], [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] ordered the expansion of the Ballah Bypass from {{convert|61|m}} wide to {{convert|312|m}} wide for {{convert|35|km}}. The project was called the [[New Suez Canal]], as it would allow ships to transit the canal in both directions simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marinelink.com/news/completes-waterway-egypt394813.aspx|title=Egypt Completes New Waterway in Suez Canal|first=Aiswarya|last=Lakshmi|date=17 July 2015|accessdate=6 August 2015|agency=MarineLink}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/12/135544/Business/Economy/Egypt-completes-dredging-for-new-waterway-in-Suez-.aspx|title=Egypt completes dredging for new waterway in Suez Canal|date=16 July 2015|accessdate=6 August 2015|work=Al-Ahram}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project cost more than $8 billion and was completed within one year.

* Circa 1799 – Napoleon Bonaparte conquers Egypt and orders a feasibility analysis. This reports a supposed {{convert|10|m|ft|sing=on}} difference in sea levels and a high cost, so the project is put on hold.
* Circa 1840 – A second survey finds the first analysis incorrect. A direct link between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea is possible and not as expensive as previously estimated.
* 30 November 1854 – The former French consul in Cairo, Ferdinand Marie de Lesseps, obtains the first license for construction and subsequent operation from the Viceroy for a period of 99 years.
* 6 January 1856 – de Lesseps is provided with a second, more detailed license.
* 15 December 1858 – de Lesseps establishes the "Compagnie Universelle du Canal Maritime de Suez", with [[Said of Egypt|Said Pasha]] acquiring 22% of the Suez Canal Company; the majority is controlled by French private holders.
* 25 April 1859 – construction officially starts.
* 17 November 1869 – The canal is opened, owned and operated by Suez Canal Company.
* 18 December 1873 – The International Commission of Constantinople establishes the Suez Canal Net Ton and the Suez Canal Special Tonnage Certificate (as known today)
* 25 November 1875 – Britain becomes a minority share holder in the company, acquiring 44%, with the remainder being controlled by French business syndicates.
* 20 May 1882 – Britain [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir|invades]] Egypt, with French assistance, and begins its occupation of Egypt.
* 25 August 1882 – Britain takes control of the canal.
* 2 March 1888 – The [[Convention of Constantinople]] renews the guaranteed right of passage of all ships through the canal during war and peace; these rights were already part of the licenses awarded to de Lesseps, but are recognised as international law.
* 14 November 1936 – Following a [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|new treaty]], Britain theoretically pulls out of Egypt, but establishes the 'Suez Canal Zone' under its control.
* 13 June 1956 – Suez Canal Zone is restored to Egyptian sovereignty, following British withdrawal and years of negotiations.
* 26 July 1956 – Egypt nationalizes the company; its Egyptian assets, rights and obligations are transferred to the Suez Canal Authority, which compensates the previous owners at the established pre-nationalization price. Egypt closes the canal to Israeli shipping as part of a broader blockade involving the Straits of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba.
* 31 October 1956 to 24 April 1957 – the canal is blocked to shipping following the [[Suez Crisis]], a conflict that leads to an Israeli,  French and British occupation of the canal zone.
* 22 December 1956 – The canal zone is restored to Egyptian control, following French and British withdrawal, and the landing of [[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF]] troops.
* 5 June 1967 to 10 June 1975 – the canal is blocked by Egypt, following the [[Six-Day War|war with Israel]]; it becomes the front line during the ensuing [[War of Attrition]] and the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 war]], remaining closed to international shipping, until [[Sinai Interim Agreement|general agreement]] was near.
* 1 January 2008 – New rules of navigation passed by the Suez Canal Authority come into force.
* 6 August 2015 – The new canal extensions are opened.

== Layout and operation ==
{{Suez Canal map}}

When built, the canal was {{convert|164|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep. After several enlargements, it is {{convert|193.30|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|24|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep and {{convert|205|m|ft}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/sc.aspx?show=12|title=Canal Characteristics|publisher=Suez Canal Authority|year=2010|accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of the northern access [[channel (geography)|channel]] of {{convert|22|km|mi|abbr=on}}, the canal itself of {{convert|162.25|km|mi|abbr=on}} and the southern access channel of {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Land&amp;people/SCanal/031300000000000002.htm |title=Characteristics of the canal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309011030/http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Land%26people/SCanal/031300000000000002.htm |archivedate=9 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called ''[[New Suez Canal]]'', functional since 6 August 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Navigation Circular "The New Suez Canal" No 5/2015|url=http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/showNc.aspx?id=105|publisher=Suez Canal Authority|date=|accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; currently has a new parallel canal in the middle part, with its length over {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}}. The current parameters of the Suez Canal, including both individual canals of the parallel section are: depth {{convert|23|to|24|m|0}} and width at least {{convert|205|to|225|m|0}} (that width measured at {{convert|11|m|0}} of depth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Attached Charts" to Navigation Circular "The New Suez Canal" No 5/2015|url=http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/Files/Circular/Suez%20Canal%20Cross%20Section.pdf|publisher=Suez Canal Authority|date=|accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capacity ===
{{see also|Suezmax}}

The canal allows passage of ships up to {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[draft (hull)|draft]] or 240,000 [[deadweight ton]]s and up to a height of {{convert|68|m|ft|abbr=on}} above water level and a maximum [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|77.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} under certain conditions.&lt;ref name="suezcanal.gov.eg"&gt;Suez Canal Authority http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/sc.aspx?show=12|title=Canal Characteristics|publisher=Suez Canal Authority|year=2010|accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The canal can handle more traffic and larger ships than the [[Panama Canal]], as [[Suezmax]] dimensions are greater than both [[Panamax]] and [[New Panamax]]. Some supertankers are too large to traverse the canal. Others can offload part of their cargo onto a canal-owned boat to reduce their draft, transit, and reload at the other end of the canal.

=== Navigation ===
[[File:SuezCanal ElBallah.JPG|thumb|Ships moored at El Ballah during transit]]
[[File:MEDCURR.GIF|thumb|Predominant currents in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] for June]]

The canal has no [[canal lock|locks]] because of the flat terrain, and the minor sea level difference between each end is inconsequential for shipping. As the canal has no sea surge gates, the ports at the ends would be subject to the sudden impact of [[tsunami]]s from the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea, according to a 2012 article in the ''Journal of Coastal Research''.&lt;ref name="FinklPelinovsky2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finkl|first1=Charles W.|last2=Pelinovsky|first2=Efim|last3=Cathcart|first3=Richard B.|title=A Review of Potential Tsunami Impacts to the Suez Canal|journal=Journal of Coastal Research|volume=283|year=2012|pages=745–759|issn=0749-0208|doi=10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12A-00002.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one shipping lane with passing areas in Ballah-Bypass near [[El Qantara]] and in the Great Bitter Lake. On a typical day, three convoys transit the canal, two southbound and one northbound. The passage takes between 11 and 16 hours at a speed of around {{convert|8|kn|km/h mph|0}}. The low speed helps prevent erosion of the banks by ships' [[wake]]s.

By 1955, about two-thirds of Europe's oil passed through the canal. Around 8% of world sea trade is carried via the canal. In 2008, 21,415 vessels passed through the canal and the receipts totaled $5.381 billion,&lt;ref name="suezcanal.gov.eg"/&gt; with an average cost per ship of $251,000.

New Rules of Navigation came into force on 1 January 2008, passed by the board of directors of the [[Suez Canal Authority]] (SCA) to organise vessels' transit. The most important amendments include allowing vessels with {{convert|62|ft|adj=on}} draught to pass, increasing the allowed breadth from {{convert|32|m}} to {{convert|40|m}} (following improvement operations), and imposing a fine on vessels using divers from outside the SCA inside the canal boundaries without permission. The amendments allow vessels loaded with dangerous cargo (such as radioactive or flammable materials) to pass if they conform with the latest amendments provided by international conventions.

The SCA has the right to determine the number of [[Tugboat|tugs]] required to assist warships traversing the canal, to achieve the highest degree of safety during transit.&lt;ref&gt;SC News&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operation ===
[[File:Capesize bulk carrier at Suez Canal Bridge.JPG|thumb|Post-deepening, a [[capesize]] [[bulk carrier]] approaches the [[Suez Canal Bridge|Friendship Bridge]]]]
[[File:Bittersee suezkanal.JPG|thumb|Northbound convoy waits in the Great Bitter Lake as southbound convoy passes, October 2014]]

Before August 2015, the canal was too narrow for free two-way traffic, so ships would pass in convoys and use bypasses. The by-passes were  {{convert|78|km|0|abbr=on}} out of {{convert|193|km|0|abbr=on}} (40%). From north to south, they are: Port Said by-pass (entrances) {{convert|36.5|km|0|abbr=on}}, Ballah by-pass &amp; anchorage, {{convert|9|km|0|abbr=on}}, Timsah by-pass {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}}, and the Deversoir by-pass (northern end of the Great Bitter Lake) {{convert|27.5|km|0|abbr=on}}. The bypasses were completed in 1980.

Typically, it would take a ship 12 to 16 hours to transit the canal. The canal's 24-hour capacity was about 76 standard ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emdb.gov.eg/suezcanal/traffic.aspx|title=Traffic system|accessdate=8 February 2013|publisher=Egyptian Maritime Data Bank (EMDB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Egypt chose a consortium that includes the Egyptian army and global engineering firm [[Dar Al-Handasah]] to develop an international industrial and logistics hub in the Suez Canal area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN0G30HY20140803|title=Egypt awards Suez hub project to consortium that includes army: sources|first=Stephen Kalin and Yasmine|last=Saleh|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began the construction of a new canal section from km 60 to km 95 combined with expansion and deep digging of the other 37&amp;nbsp;km of the canal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/sc.aspx?show=69&lt;/ref&gt; This will allow navigation in both directions simultaneously in the 72&amp;nbsp;km long central section of the canal. These extensions were formally opened on 6 August 2015 by President Al-Sisi.&lt;ref name="SuezExpansion"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/05/egypt-build-new-suez-canal|title=Egypt to build new Suez canal|first=Patrick|last=Kingsley|date=5 August 2014|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-33800076 |title=Egypt launches Suez Canal expansion |publisher=BBC News |date=6 August 2015 |accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convoy sailing ===
Since the canal does not cater to unregulated two-way traffic, all ships transit in convoys on regular times, scheduled on a 24-hour basis. Each day, a single northbound convoy starts at 04:00 from Suez. At dulka lane sections, the convoy uses the eastern route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/sc.aspx?show=13|title=Traffic system|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/showNc.aspx?id=105|title=Navigation Circular 5/2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Navigation, Convoy System|url=http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/NR.aspx?node=81|accessdate=17 February 2013|publisher=Suez Canal Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synchronised with this convoy's passage is the southbound convoy. It starts at 03:30 from Port Said and so passes the Northbound convoy in the two-lane section{{clarify|date=May 2016|reason=Unclear in article and sources if provided times are in UTC or local time}}.

=== Canal crossings ===
[[File:Suez canal english.jpg|thumb|The canal in 2015]]

From north to south, the crossings are:
* The [[Suez Canal Bridge]] ({{coord|30.828248|N|32.317572|E|region:EG_type:landmark|name=Suez Canal Bridge}}), also called the Egyptian-Japanese Friendship Bridge, a high-level road bridge at [[El Qantara]]. In [[Arabic]], ''al qantara'' means "arch". Opened in 2001, it has a {{convert|70|m|ft|sing=on}} clearance over the canal and was built with assistance from the Japanese government and by [[Kajima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kajima.co.jp/english/prof/overview/history_08.html |title=Kajima History |publisher=[[Kajima]] |accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[El Ferdan Railway Bridge]] ({{Coord|30.657|N|32.334|E|source:dewiki|name=El Ferdan Railway Bridge}}) {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Ismailia]] ({{Coord|30|35|N|32|16|E|name=Ismailia}}) was completed in 2001 and is the longest [[swing bridge|swing-span bridge]] in the world, with a span of 340&amp;nbsp;m (1100&amp;nbsp;ft). The previous bridge was destroyed in 1967 during the Arab-Israeli conflict. The current bridge is no longer functional due to the expansion of the Suez Canal, as the parallel shipping lane completed in 2015 just east of the bridge lacks a structure spanning it.
* Pipelines taking fresh water under the canal to [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], about {{convert|57|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Suez, at {{Coord|30|27.3|N|32|21.0|E|name=Fresh-water pipelines}}.
* [[Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel]] ({{coord|30|5|9|N|32|34|32|E|source:svwiki_region:EG_type:landmark|name=Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel}}) south of the Great Bitter Lake ({{Coord|30|20|N|32|23|E|region:EG_type:waterbody|name=Great Bitter Lake}}) was built in 1983. Because of leakage problems, a new water-tight tunnel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kajima.co.jp/topics/perspect/vol_15_3/salt/ |title=Salt-Corroded Tunnel Undergoes Major Renovation |publisher=Kajima.co.jp |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was built inside the old one from 1992 to 1995.
* The [[Suez Canal overhead powerline crossing]] ({{coord|29.996|N|32.583|E|source:dewiki|name=Suez Canal overhead powerline crossing}}) was built in 1999.

A railway on the west bank runs parallel to the canal for its entire length.

Six new tunnels for cars and trains are also planned across the canal.&lt;ref name=tunnels&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tunnelbuilder.com/News/Six-tunnels-under-Suez-Canal-.aspx|title=Six tunnels under Suez Canal|work=Tunnelbuilder|date=1 December 2014|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the [[Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel|Ahmed Hamdi]] is the only tunnel connecting [[Suez]] to the Sinai.

== Alternative routes ==
=== Cape Agulhas ===
The main alternative is around [[Cape Agulhas]], the southernmost point of Africa, commonly referred as the [[Cape of Good Hope]] route. This was the only sea route before the canal was constructed, and when the canal was closed. It is still the only route for ships that are [[Capesize|too large]] for the canal. In the early 21st century, the Suez Canal has suffered from diminished traffic due to [[piracy in Somalia]], with many shipping companies choosing to take the long route instead.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Stack, [http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2008/1121/p99s01-wome.html Arab countries meet to tackle Somali pirate threat] – ''The Christian Science Monitor'' (21 November 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Wasser, [http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Somali-piracy-costs-Suez-Canal-business-3163446.php Somali piracy costs Suez Canal business], ''San Francisco Chronicle'' (29 April 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2008 and 2010, it is estimated that the canal lost 10% of traffic due to the threat of piracy, and another 10% due to the [[Financial crisis (2007–present)|financial crisis]]. An [[oil tanker]] going from Saudi Arabia to the United States has {{convert|2700|mi|0|abbr=on}} longer to go when taking the route south of Africa rather than the canal.&lt;ref name=piracycost&gt;Bowden, Anna et al.

Before the canal's opening in 1869, goods were sometimes offloaded from ships and carried overland between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.&lt;ref&gt;''Overland Mail'' by [[Thomas Fletcher Waghorn]], ''Railway Alexandria – Cairo – Suez'' built by [[Robert Stephenson]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Northern Sea Route ===
[[File:Northern Sea Route vs Southern Sea Route.svg|thumb|A graphical comparison between the [[Northern Sea Route]] (blue) and an alternative route through Suez Canal (red)]]

In recent years, the [[Climate change in the Arctic|shrinking]] [[Arctic]] [[sea ice]] has made the [[Northern Sea Route]] feasible for commercial cargo ships between Europe and East Asia during a six-to-eight-week window in the summer months, shortening the voyage by thousands of miles compared to that through the Suez Canal. According to polar climate researchers, as the extent of the Arctic summer ice pack recedes the route will become passable without the help of [[icebreaker]]s for a greater period each summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.husdal.com/2011/05/22/the-final-frontier-the-northern-sea-route|title=The Final Frontier: The Northern Sea Route}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://asiancorrespondent.com/39881/bye-bye-pirates-hello-north-east-passage | publisher = AsianCorrespondent.com | title = Bye pirates, hello Northeast Passage | date = 3 January 2010 | accessdate=29 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1213025/Melting-ice-cap-opens-Northeast-Passage-British-ships.html | work = [[Daily Mail]] | title = Melting ice cap opens up Northeast Passage to British ships | date = 12 September 2009 | accessdate=29 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bremen]]-based [[Beluga Group]] claimed in 2009 to be the first Western company to attempt using the Northern Sea Route without assistance from icebreakers, cutting 4000 nautical miles off the journey between [[Ulsan]], [[Korea]] and [[Rotterdam]], the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.barentsobserver.com/german-vessels-ready-for-the-northern-sea-route.4616626-16175.html |publisher=BarentsObserver.com |title=German vessels ready for the Northern Sea Route |date=5 August 2009 |accessdate=21 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106161908/http://www.barentsobserver.com/german-vessels-ready-for-the-northern-sea-route.4616626-16175.html |archivedate=6 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Negev desert railroad ===
[[Israel]] has declared that it will construct a [[High-speed railway to Eilat|railroad]] through the [[Negev]] desert to compete with the canal, with construction partly financed by China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.e24.ee/728858/iisrael-ehitab-vahemere-ja-punase-mere-vahele-raudtee/ | publisher = E24.ee | title = (In Estonian) Israel builds a railroad between the Mediterranean and the Red sea | date = 5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental impact ==
{{Main article |Lessepsian migration}}
The opening of the canal created the first salt-water passage between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. Although the Red Sea is about {{convert|1.2|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} higher than the eastern Mediterranean,&lt;ref&gt;Madl, Pierre (1999). [http://biophysics.sbg.ac.at/lm/lesseps.htm Essay about the phenomenon of Lessepsian Migration], Colloquial Meeting of Marine Biology I, Salzburg, April 1999 (revised in Nov. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; the current between the Mediterranean and the middle of the canal at the [[Bitter Lakes]] flows north in winter and south in summer. The current south of the Bitter Lakes is tidal, varying with the tide at Suez.&lt;ref name=rsp/&gt; The Bitter Lakes, which were hypersaline natural lakes, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalised with that of the Red Sea the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonise the eastern Mediterranean. The Red Sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the [[Atlantic]], so the Red Sea species have advantages over Atlantic species in the less salty and nutrient-rich eastern Mediterranean. Accordingly, most Red Sea species invade the Mediterranean biota, and only few do the opposite. This migratory phenomenon is called [[Lessepsian migration]] (after Ferdinand de Lesseps) or "Erythrean invasion". Also impacting the eastern Mediterranean, starting in 1968, was the operation of [[Aswan High Dam]] across the Nile. While providing for increased human development, the project reduced the inflow of freshwater and ended all natural nutrient-rich silt entering the eastern Mediterranean at the [[Nile Delta]]. This provided less natural dilution of Mediterranean salinity and ended the higher levels of natural [[turbidity]], additionally making conditions more like those in the Red Sea.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Invasive species originating from the Red Sea and [[introduced species|introduced]] into the Mediterranean by the canal have become a major component of the Mediterranean ecosystem and have serious impacts on the ecology, endangering many local and [[endemism|endemic]] species. About 300 species from the Red Sea have been identified in the Mediterranean, and there are probably others yet unidentified. The Egyptian government's intent to enlarge the canal has raised concerns from [[marine biologist]]s, fearing that this will worsen the invasion of Red Sea species.&lt;ref&gt;Galil and Zenetos (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the canal was preceded by cutting a small fresh-water canal called [[Sweet Water Canal]] from [[Nile Delta|the Nile delta]] along [[Wadi Tumilat]] to the future canal, with a southern branch to Suez and a northern branch to Port Said. Completed in 1863, these brought fresh water to a previously arid area, initially for canal construction, and subsequently facilitating growth of agriculture and settlements along the canal.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suez Canal Economic Zone ==
The Suez Canal Economic Zone, sometimes shortened to the Suez Canal Zone, describes the set of locations neighbouring the canal where customs rates have been reduced to zero in order to attract investment. The zone comprises over 600km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; within the governorates of [[Port Said Governorate|Port Said]], [[Ismailia Governorate|Ismailia]] and [[Suez Governorate|Suez]]. Projects in the zone are collectively described as the [[Suez Canal Area Development Project]] (SCADP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suez Canal Economic Zone|url=http://www.gafi.gov.eg/English/MediaCenter/News/Pages/Suez06-1-2016.aspx|website=GAFI|publisher=Ministry of Investment, Egypt|language=en|date=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt aims to attract $30 bln in investment in Suez Canal Zone within 5 years: Investment minister|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/12/274195/Business/Economy/Egypt-aims-to-attract--bln-in-investment-in-Suez-C.aspx|work=Ahram Online|date=25 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan focuses on development of [[East Port Said Industrial Zone|East Port Said]] and the port of [[Ain Sokhna]], and hopes to extend to four more ports at West Port Said, El-Adabiya, [[Arish]] and [[El Tor, Egypt|El Tor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abdel-Razek|first1=Sherine|title=Canal corridor developments|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/12938.aspx|work=Al Ahram Weekly|date=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The zone incorporates the three "Qualifying Industrial Zones" at Port Said, Ismailia and Suez, a 1996 American initiative to encourage economic ties between Israel and its neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qualifying Industrial Zones|url=https://www.amcham.org.eg/information-resources/trade-resources/egypt-us-relations/qualifying-industrial-zones|website=American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt|language=en|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sonnensensor.jpg|thumbnail|right|Non-linear sun sensor used by the [[TET-1]] German [[Miniaturized satellite|microsatellite]].]]
A '''sun sensor''' is a [[navigational instrument]] used by [[spacecraft]] to detect the position of the [[sun]].&lt;ref name="airbus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="azo"/&gt; Sun sensors are used for [[attitude control]], [[solar array]] pointing, [[gyroscope|gyro]] updating, and [[safe mode (spacecraft)|fail-safe]] recovery.&lt;ref name="adcole_DSS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adcole_HA"/&gt;

In addition to spacecraft, sun sensors find use in ground-based [[weather station]]s and sun-tracking systems, and aerial vehicles including [[Balloon (aeronautics)|balloon]]s and [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s.&lt;ref name="azo"/&gt;

==Mechanism==
There are various types of sun sensors, which differ in their technology and performance characteristics. Sun presence sensors provide a [[binary number|binary]] output, indicating when the sun is within the sensor's [[field of view]]. [[Analog electronics|Analog]] and [[digital electronics|digital]] sun sensors, in contrast, indicate the angle of the sun by continuous and [[discrete signal]] outputs, respectively.&lt;ref name="azo"/&gt;

In typical sun sensors, a thin slit at the top of a rectangular chamber allows a line of light to fall on an array of [[photodetector]] cells at the bottom of the chamber. A voltage is induced in these cells, which is registered electronically. By orienting two sensors perpendicular to each other, the direction of the sun can be fully determined.&lt;ref name="azo"/&gt;

Often, multiple sensors will share processing electronics.&lt;ref name="adcole_DSS"/&gt;

==Criteria==
There are a number of design and performance criteria which dictate the selection of a sun sensor model:
*[[Field of view]]
*[[Angular resolution]]
*[[Accuracy and precision|Accuracy]] and [[Stochastic drift|stability]]
*[[Mass]] and [[volume]]
*Input voltage and power
*Output characteristics (including electrical characteristics, update frequency, [[nonlinearity]], and encoding)
*Durability (including [[radiation hardening]] and tolerance to [[vibration]] and [[residual stress|thermal cycling]])

==Fixed (landline) codes==
Area codes in [[Afghanistan]] are two digits long. It is common to write phone numbers as '''(0xx) yyy-yyyy''', where '''xx''' is the area code. The 0 prefix is for long-distance dialing from within the country. International callers should dial '''+93 xx yyyyyyy'''.

Area codes for common cities are:

*'''020 783625101''': [[Kabul]]
*'''026 yyy yyyy''': [[Daykundi]]
*'''030 yyy yyyy''': [[Kandahar]]
*'''040 yyy yyyy''': [[Herat]]
*'''050 yyy yyyy''': [[Mazar-i-Sharif]]
*'''060 yyy yyyy''': [[Jalalabad]]
*'''070 yyy yyyy''': [[Gardez]]

==Mobile phone codes==
There are six mobile phone companies currently operating in [[Afghanistan]]. Mobile phone numbers are written as '''(0xx yyy-yyyy)''', where '''xx''' is the code. The 0 prefix is for dialing from within the country. International callers should dial '''+93 xx yyy yyyy'''.

Some of the mobile phone codes are:

[[Afghan_Wireless|AWCC]]
*'''070 yyy yyyy'''
*'''071 yyy yyyy'''


[[Roshan_(telco)|Roshan (TDC)]]
*'''079 yyy yyyy'''
