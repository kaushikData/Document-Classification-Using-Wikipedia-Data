==Background and education==

===Childhood===
Khoo was born Adam Khoo Yean Ann on 8 April 1974, to Vince Khoo and Betty L. Khoo-Kingsley. At age eight, Khoo was expelled from [[Saint Stephen's School, Singapore|St Stephen's Primary School]]&lt;ref name = "NewPaper" /&gt; for misbehavior, partly due to poor academic results.&lt;ref name = "MasterMind"&gt;{{cite book | last = Khoo | first = Adam |author2= Tan, Stuart | title = Master Your Mind, Design Your Destiny | publisher = Adam Khoo Learning Technologies Group Pte Ltd | year = 2004 | pages = 348 | isbn = 978-9810508562}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[parents]] hunted for a primary school willing to accept him and finally found [[Ngee Ann Primary School]].&lt;ref name="NewPaper" /&gt; Due to his poor results at the [[Primary School Leaving Examination|Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE)]], he did not qualify to enter any of the six secondary schools his parents had chosen.&lt;ref name="MasterMind" /&gt; He eventually enrolled in a [[government school]], Ping Yi Secondary School, where he passed only five out of eight academic subjects&lt;ref name = "MasterMind" /&gt; and finished 156th out of 160 Secondary 1 Express Stream students.&lt;ref name="SundayTimes"&gt;"I want to be a millionaire by 26", The Sunday Times, 21 October 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewPaper" /&gt;

Khoo's parents and teachers described him back then as capable but [[laziness|lazy]], [[apathy|indifferent]] and [[Behavioral addiction|addicted]] to television.&lt;ref name="NewPaper" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "STLife"&gt;"Lousy at learning? Take heart", The Straits Times LIFE!, 6 August 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He described himself as being totally uninterested in [[learning]] (he was frustrated as he felt he could not learn),&lt;ref name = "STLife" /&gt; extremely unmotivated,&lt;ref name = "TheEdge"&gt;"From underachiever to millionaire", The Edge Singapore, 18 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; physically weak and mentally lethargic.&lt;ref name = "MasterMind" /&gt; His [[Stepfamily|stepsister]] was a straight-As student in the [[Gifted Education Programme (Singapore)|Gifted Education Programme]] at [[Raffles Girls' School (Secondary)|Raffles Girls' School]]&lt;ref name = "NewPaper" /&gt; while cousins from his close-knit [[extended family]] were from the best schools in Singapore.&lt;ref name = "MasterMind" /&gt; He had poor [[social skill]]s,&lt;ref name = "MasterMind" /&gt; did not enjoy [[reading education|reading]] anything but comics&lt;ref name = "TheEdge" /&gt; and was addicted to [[arcade game]]s and TV programs.&lt;ref name = "MasterMind" /&gt; He tried to join the [[Scout Movement]], but was thrown out six months later for not passing the basic qualifying test, the 'Scout Standard', as he did not bother to try.&lt;ref name = "MasterMind" /&gt;

===Turning point in education===
In 1987, when Khoo was 13, his parents enrolled their [[Underachiever|"under-achiever"]] son for a five-day residential program at Ladyhill Hotel called Super-Teen Camp.&lt;ref name = "SundayTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "NewPaper" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bizad" /&gt; The man responsible for spotting Khoo's "gifted talent" in Super-Teen was Dr. Ernest Wong, [[Entrepreneur|founder]], principal consultant and master teacher of Ernesco, the Centre for Motivational Language Learning based in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]&lt;ref name = "Bizad" /&gt; (the Super-Teen Camp is now under Learning Mastery Pte. Ltd.) Dr. Wong's [[teaching]] tools incorporated and adapted an American-developed [[learning technology]] called [[neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP), as well as whole-brain learning.&lt;ref name = "Bizad" /&gt; This was the beginning of Khoo's interest and journey in mastering motivational techniques,&lt;ref name = "Bizad" /&gt; which formed the foundation of many of his books and [[seminars]].

Within three months of the program, Khoo climbed to among the top 18 in his secondary school.&lt;ref name = "Bizad" /&gt; He went on to rank among the top 10 in Ping Yi Secondary within a year,&lt;ref name = "MasterMind" /&gt; topped his school in the [[Singaporean GCE 'O' Level|GCE 'O' Level examinations]] with the lowest scoring aggregate, and was the first in Ping Yi Secondary to qualify for the then-top [[junior college]] in Singapore, [[Victoria Junior College]].&lt;ref name = "SundayTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "MasterMind" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bizad" /&gt; At Victoria Junior College, he was president of the Economics Society&lt;ref name = "STLife" /&gt; and scored three A's for his [[GCE Advanced Level|GCE 'A' Level examinations]].&lt;ref name = "STLife" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bizad" /&gt; He entered the [[Administration (business)|business administration]] [[Faculty (university)|faculty]] at the [[National University of Singapore]] (NUS) and continued his notable academic achievements by making it to the [[dean's list]] every year,&lt;ref name = "SundayTimes" /&gt; ranked among the top 1 percent of academic achievers&lt;ref name = "MasterMind" /&gt; and became a pioneer in the university's Talent Development Programme (TDP), the tertiary equivalent of the gifted education programme for secondary schools.&lt;ref name = "SundayTimes" /&gt; He graduated with an honours degree in business administration from NUS.

==Career==
At age 15, Khoo was devouring books on [[Warren Buffett]]'s investment techniques.&lt;ref name = "TheEdge" /&gt; While still in secondary school, he formed a [[mobile disco]] company with his [[friendship|friends]], using his grandmother's house to re-create a [[disco]] and charged [[teenagers]] who attended a [[fee]]. He even took over the [[Job (role)|job]] of the deejay that he [[employment|hired]], after studying him.&lt;ref name = "NewPaper" /&gt; At 16, he began investing most of his time and money to read and undergo training sessions in NLP&lt;ref name = "Bizad" /&gt; in the United States. At 17, he became a freelance [[Motivational speaker|motivational trainer]] by visiting schools in Singapore, making the bold proposition of turning the worst students around for no charge in the beginning. Eventually, he started charging S$25 per student for half a day's training.&lt;ref name = "TheEdge" /&gt;

After completing [[National Service]] in the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] at age 21, Khoo went into partnership with three NUS friends and registered an event management company, Creatsoul Entertainment.&lt;ref name = "STLife" /&gt; The company organised [[Dance (event)|hops, jams]] and other entertainment activities&lt;ref name = "NewPaper" /&gt; for clients like [[individuals]], companies and organisations at NUS and [[Nanyang Technological University|Nanyang Technological University (NTU)]].&lt;ref name = "STLife" /&gt; This was later re-registered as Event Gurus Pte Ltd, an event management company.

At 23, Khoo obtained his [[licence]] in NLP in [[Seattle]], Washington.&lt;ref name = "Bizad" /&gt; At 24, he became a trainer at SuperTeen,&lt;ref name = "SundayTimes" /&gt; conducting courses for organisations like the [[Chinese Development Assistance Council|Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC)]], [[Association of Muslim Professionals|Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP)]], [[Nanyang Girls' High School]] and the Universitas Pelita Harapan (UPH) in [[Jakarta]].&lt;ref name = "STLife" /&gt; At 25, Khoo was coaching top insurance agents and marketing managers twice his age on how to boost sales.&lt;ref name = "SundayTimes" /&gt; At this time, his father, Vince Khoo, who owned the [[advertising agency]] Adcom, bought out all partners and offered the younger Khoo the opportunity to run it.&lt;ref name = "SundayTimes" /&gt; Within three months, he turned it around from making losses in 1998–1999 to clinching a pitching rate of 80 percent&lt;ref name = "SundayTimes" /&gt; with the first monthly [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], and went on to increase margins by 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cargonewsasia.com.hk/timesnet/data/ab/docs/ab3202.html "Driving Ambition" by James Lee] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912165338/http://www.cargonewsasia.com.hk/timesnet/data/ab/docs/ab3202.html |date=12 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their clients have included AIA, [[Dumex]], [[Mobil]] (lost during the [[Exxon]] [[merger]]), Phillip Wain slimming centres, Sobe Fresh Soya Milk, [[Tabasco sauce|Tabasco]], [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]], Sinsin, [[Night Safari, Singapore]] and [[MobileOne|MobileOne (M1)]].&lt;ref name = "SundayTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adasiaonline.com/listingsEntry2.asp?ID=407&amp;cid=339&amp;t=articles&amp;PT=articles&amp;PTS=Featured+Agency%2FBranding+Specialist&amp;F=articles "Following father's footsteps to take a leap forward"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 26, Khoo earned his first million, from giving motivational training at schools and companies (the most lucrative, earning him up to S$1000 an hour), his entertainment company and shrewd investments in [[equities]], [[unit trusts]] and [[Real property|property]].&lt;ref name = "NewPaper" /&gt;

==Portfolio==

===Investments===
Inspired by the book ''Buffettology'', he started dabbling in the stock market while in the army.&lt;ref name="ST Feb2009"&gt;"Big investor but frugal spender", Me &amp; Money, The Straits Times, 22 February 2009 [http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20090223-123961.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a conservative and long-term investor,&lt;ref name = "ST Feb2009" /&gt; Khoo goes for investments with very low [[risk]] and high [[Return (finance)|returns]],&lt;ref name = "TheEdge" /&gt; favouring cash-rich companies with low [[debts]] and the potential to consistently increase their [[earnings]].&lt;ref name = "ST Feb2009" /&gt; He prefers investing in [[stock]]s and [[Option (finance)|options]], using a variety of investing strategies including [[momentum investing|momentum]] and [[value investing]].&lt;ref name = "TheEdge" /&gt;

===Property===
Khoo's [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] consists of [[property]] that he [[renting|rents]] out. In 1998, he bought a [[condominium]] in East Coast for S$480,000 and rented it out for about S$3,000. He sold it for S$650,000 in 2004. Other properties he owns include a house in East Coast and a condominium at Robertson Quay.&lt;ref name = "ST Feb2009" /&gt;

===Businesses===
Khoo does not believe in taking on [[consumer debt]] and prefers starting businesses with zero [[Financial capital|capital]], paying freelance fees or stocks in the beginning until [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] is generated.&lt;ref name = "TheEdge" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8112">'''Body shopping''' is the practice of [[consultancy]] firms recruiting workers (generally in [[information technology]] sector) in order to contract their services out on tactical short to mid-term basis. IT services companies that practice body shopping assert that they provide real services (such as software development) rather than the "sham" of merely farming out professionals to overseas companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=39&amp;ndash;40|title=Virtual Migration|author=[[A. Aneesh|Aneesh Aneesh]]|chapter=Body Shopping|publisher=Duke University Press|date=2006|isbn=9780822336693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and origin ==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
Body shopping in IT originated during the mid-1990s when there was a huge demand for people with [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]], [[COBOL]] and related technology skills to prevent systems being affected by the [[Y2K]] bug.

Most specialist Y2K consulting companies operating in the US, Europe, the Middle East, Japan and Australia outsourced their technical manpower requirements to companies operating in India. 

During the period of 1996-97, such companies operating with India base responded to the heavy demand by recruiting and training local graduates in India specifically for [[Y2K]]. Their consultants either worked onshore or offshore at high utilization rates generating huge [[profit margin]]s and cash reserves. The high-profit margin during this period resulted in fast growth and sufficient assets to invest and expand operations to other IT related business segments post-Y2K.

=== Modern era ===
In the modern era of IT off-shoring, outsourcing, and cloud computing, it is widely accepted that IT service companies' strategy (especially for those operating with a huge technical manpower base in India) still continue to focus on similar lines. The companies that do body shopping are renowned for training and developing technical skills for a wide range of client base that is of current demand.
Researchers point out that many Indian companies focus heavily on developing a large pool of human resources with technical skills creating a [[marketplace]] to 'buy' technical skills on an hourly or daily basis.

This led to significant market developments in two areas in the early 2000s:

# Fierce competition amongst IT service companies from India competing on a global level to win 'time and material and labor tenders' from multinational giants for their IT needs. Such a strategy, though heavily linked to procurement needs of the end-customer, enables IT companies operating from offshore (in particular India) to forecast demand for technical and managerial competencies based on IT-skills-market trends in order to position themselves competitively.&lt;ref name=body&gt;Brenda S. Yeoh and Katie Willis, editors, 'State/Nation/Transnation: Perspectives on Transnationalism in the Asia-Pacific', Routledge, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-415-30279-1}}, pp. 166-167.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Technology and consulting companies operating mainly in western markets during the 1990s (e.g. [[Accenture]], [[IBM]], [[Hewlett-Packard]]) were forced to open offices in southeast Asia and move their manpower base there to compete with traditional manpower providers operated from India (e.g. [[Infosys]], [[Wipro]], [[Tata Consultancy Services]]) on large global-level IT bids.

According to a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services report to Congress, for fiscal year 2012, 59 percent of H-1B visas went to computer-related occupations. The same report also cited that 64 percent of the H-1B visa petitions granted were given to workers originating from India.&lt;ref name="Indentured Servitude"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stock |last2=Putnam |last3=Pham |last4=Carroll |first1=Stephen |first2=Julie |first3=Scott |first4=Jeremy|title=Silicon Valley's "Body Shop" Secret: Highly Educated Foreign Workers Treated Like Indentured Servants|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/Silicon-Valleys-Body-Shop-Secret-280567322.html|website=NBC Bay Area|publisher=The Investigate Unit|accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Report&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Vallance|first1=Brian|title=Characteristics of H1B Specialty Occupation Workers|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1347381-2b-h1b-fy-12-characteristics.html|website=Document Cloud|publisher=US Citizenship and Immigration Services|accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revenue model ==
Body shopping companies mainly recruit off-shore and provide training to their employees using their off-shore facilities.

Employment costs (both short-term and permanent) are generally offset by the highly profitable billing ratio, especially for on-site assignments abroad. Most companies boast a utilization rate of 80%, which also takes into account the potentially long 'bench period', where an employee is not billable or when their skills are not in demand.

== Indian body shopping networks ==
In India, traditional body shopping has evolved in its due course post-[[Y2K]] era to create strong networking and collaboration between competing Indian body shops working abroad. All body shops claim to have the ability to place Indian workers in almost any country using the resources and services of other Indian body shops operating in the target country.&lt;ref name=Biao1&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Brenda S. Yeoh |editor2=Katie Willis |title=State/Nation/Transnation: Perspectives on Transnationalism in the Asia-Pacific|publisher=Routledge|date=2004|isbn=978-0-415-30279-1|pages=166&amp;ndash;167|author=Xiang Biao|chapter=Indian information technology professionals' world system: the nation and the transnation in individuals' migration strategies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one documented case study deemed as a typical example, a body shop in Hyderabad was able to win a 360 man-month deal with a U.S. company that urgently needed 40 IT workers with a very "specific" skill on a 9-month project. Although the Indian body shop company could easily find lower paid workers in India for the job, the [[H-1B visa]] process would take too long to bring them into the United States to work. Thus, the Indian firm forwarded a request to its associates' network to locate 40 Indian temporary workers in the United States. A search was undertaken by the network for available Indian H-1B workers, resulting in a list of recently laid-off Indian H-1B workers in the US. Sponsorship for the laid-off Indian H-1B workers was reassigned to a body shop and a portion of the newly employed worker's salary was given as commission to the peer body shop that helped to locate the laid off H-1B workers in their associated peer network of Indian body shops. This process of quickly recruiting available H-1B holders is what is referred to as "body shopping".&lt;ref name=Biao1/&gt;

== Offshoring and nearshoring ==

A similar "[[offshoring]]" practice started appearing more and more in the 2010 timeframe and which was a practice known as "[[nearshoring]]".  Nearshoring was the practice of hiring mostly IT professionals from Mexico.  The outward appearance being the advantage of "nearshoring" personnel being within a 2 hour or less time difference to continental U.S. companies opting to use these nearshoring services.

The next step was for a jury of 132 professional automotive journalists, from 33 different countries, under the presidency of [[Lord Montagu of Beaulieu]], to reduce the list to 5, which they did, and the result was announced in November 1999.  Finally the 5 were ranked by the jury and the overall winner was selected.

They grew up in [[Banstead]], Surrey, where their father Anthony Candy ran an art studio and a media production company, and their Cypriot mother Patricia was a drama teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/mortgageshome/article-1616982/A-property-fairytale-from-6000-to-9bn.html|title=A property investment fairytale: from a £6,000 loan to a £9bn empire - Candy brothers interview|publisher=[[This is Money]]|date=5 December 2007|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Christian was later studying for a business management degree at [[King's College London]], Nick graduated from [[University of Reading]] with a degree in [[Human Geography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint CEO and Founder, Candy &amp; Candy Ltd|url=http://www.ftconferences.com/luxury/speakerdetails/766/?PHPSESSID=e8ec7223087449c312e0b1810a47ff39|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1995, they bought their first property, a one-bedroom flat in [[Redcliffe Square]], [[Earl's Court]], London. Using a £6,000 loan from their grandmother, the brothers renovated the £122,000 apartment while living in it. Eighteen months later they sold it for £172,000, making a £50,000 profit.&lt;ref name="barrionuevo1"&gt;{{cite news|last=BARRIONUEVO|first=ALEXEI|title=The Upstarts’ Empire|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/realestate/big-deal-london-the-upstarts-empire.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=26 July 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their spare time between 1995 and 1999, the brothers began renovating flats and working their way up the property ladder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Candy and Candy: Sweet Dreams|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/candy-and-candy-sweet-dreams-777220.html|accessdate=28 April 2015|newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually they were able to give up their day jobs where Nick worked in advertising for [[J. Walter Thompson]] and Christian for investment bank [[Merrill Lynch]] and established Candy &amp; Candy in 1999, of which Nick is CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Candy and Candy profile|url=http://www.jamessamson.co.uk/magazine/profile-candy-and-candy/|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas and Christian, who did collaborate on the prestigious One Hyde Park scheme in London, operate separate independent businesses and have done for a number of years. In June 2018, Candy &amp; Candy was renamed Candy Property in order to reinforce Nick Candy’s sole ownership of the business and to align with his wider portfolio of companies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/candy-brothers-go-their-own-way-pq77g6zrr|title=Candy brothers go their own way|last=Hipwell|first=Deirdre|date=2018-07-24|work=The Times|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2004, Christian established CPC Group in [[Guernsey]], to specialise in &lt;!--formerly "exclusive". Exclusive to who? Sounds like advert. Changed to "high-end" --&gt; high-end residential developments around the world. Some of their more high-profile developments, however, have been in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mandarinoriental.com/residences/current-residences/london/|title=One Hyde Park|last=|first=|date=|website=One Hyde Park|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hyde_Park|title=Wikipedia One Hyde Park|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikipedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=July 2018}}

In 2016 and 2017 they were involved in high-profile litigation in the High Court in London which put their reputations on the line.  Mark Holyoake claimed in the High Court action that the Candy Brothers had used threats against him and his family to extort total repayments of £37m against a £12m loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/content/1c4d5c1a-1635-11e7-80f4-13e067d5072c|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were cleared of extortion, Mr Justice Nugee said in his judgment "the protagonists...have been willing to lie when they consider their commercial interests justify them doing so". Mr Justice Nugee went on to say "''he had found none of Mr Holyoake’s claims to be true, and that there had been no undue duress, influence, intimidation or unlawful interference with economic interests.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/nick-candy-seeks-criminal-probe-into-accuser-mark-holyoake-dmrglz3rd|title=Candy Judgment Press Commentary|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/holyoake-and-ors-v-candy-and-ors/|title=Neutral Citation Number: [2017] EWHC 3397 (Ch) Case No: HC-2015-003369|last=|first=|date=|website=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, following another application by Mr. Holyoake, the Court of Appeal rejected Mark Holyoake’s bid challenging the high-profile high court ruling in December 2017 (above). Lord Justice David Richards concluded that Mr Holyoake’s arguments had “no real prospect of success” meaning Mr Justice Nugee’s original decision in 2017 was affirmed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.egi.co.uk/news/holyoake-refused-permission-to-appeal-court-defeat-to-candy-brothers/|title=Richards LJ dismisses Holyoake Appeal|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In recent years Nick Candy has diversified his interests outside of real estate and developed a portfolio of global investments (often in high tech, leading edge technology) through his private investment fund Candy Ventures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.candyventures.lu/|title=Candy Ventures - Investment arm of Nick Candy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Notable development projects==

===[[One Hyde Park]] (2004)===
In 2004, the brothers sought an investment partner to help them buy the site of [[Bowater House]] in [[Knightsbridge]], with plans to demolish it and construct 86 luxury apartments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maley|first=Jacqueline|title=£20m flats offer the ultimate in lateral living|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2006/feb/25/houseprices.uknews|accessdate=26 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=25 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After setting up a joint venture with Waterknights – a private company owned by the [[Prime Minister of Qatar]] – they purchased the site from [[Land Securities]] in 2005 for £150m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Land Securities sells Bowater House, Knightsbridge|url=http://www.landsecurities.com/media/press-releases?MediaID=987|publisher=Land Securities|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They then hired the architect [[Richard Rogers]] to design the exterior, and used their own Candy &amp; Candy to handle interior design. One Hyde Park: The Residences of Mandarin Oriental, London, was constructed in four years after obtaining planning permission in 2006, with the finished development housing three commercial units: [[Rolex]], [[McLaren Automotive]] and [[Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/abu-dhabi-bank-snaps-up-last-one-hyde-park-unit-2145534.html|title=One Hyde Park Press Commentary|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One Hyde Park Background Information|url=http://www.candyandcandy.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/OHP-Background-Information2.pdf|publisher=Candy &amp; Candy|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its name, the building’s address is located at 68-114 Knightsbridge, London.&lt;ref name="barrionuevo1"/&gt;

The One Hyde Park development officially launched in January 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/constructionandproperty/8270895/One-Hyde-Park-the-worlds-most-expensive-apartments-opens-its-doors-for-the-first-time.html|title=One Hyde Park - Industry Records|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a profound effect on the global real estate market, breaking a number of industry records as the most expensive residential development in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/one-hyde-park-expensive-building-london-2011-11?IR=T#one-hyde-park-was-conceived-as-a-luxury-residence-for-ultra-wealthy-international-buyers-1|title=Industry Record reference|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  It was reported that the penthouse apartments alone fetched some of the highest prices on record&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/oligarch-buys-record-136m-london-flat-and-will-spend-another-60m-on-doing-it-up-6393883.html|title=Reporting highest prices|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In October 2018, it was reported that Nick Candy refinanced his penthouse at One Hyde Park with an £80 million mortgage from Credit Suisse in order to pursue rental opportunities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/property-tycoon-nick-candy-takes-out-80m-mortgage-on-flat-in-one-hyde-park-knightsbridge-fw9wv5zxv|title=Refinancing for rental opportunities|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===[[NoHo Square|NoHo Square (2006)]]===
In 2006, the site of the former [[Middlesex Hospital]] was purchased for £175m by Project Abbey (Guernsey) Holdings Ltd – an investment consortium which included [[Kaupthing Bank]], the now defunct Icelandic bank, and was led by the Candy’s CPC Group.&lt;ref name="keilthy1"&gt;{{cite news|last=KEILTHY|first=PAUL|title=NOHO SQUARE DEAL IN RUINS|url=http://www.thecnj.com/westend/2008/103108/wnews103108_01.html|accessdate=26 July 2012|newspaper=West End Extra|date=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, the brothers applied to [[Westminster City Council]] for planning permission to redevelop the 1.2 hectare (3 acre) site into a mixed use development of several hundred new residential units and office space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Old Middlesex Hospital, London, United Kingdom|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=867|accessdate=26 July 2012|newspaper=World Architecture News|date=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planning » Application Summary|url=http://idoxpa.westminster.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&amp;keyVal=JD3BN5RP5E000|publisher=Westminster City Council|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans were met with strong criticism from local residents over the Candy’s choice of NoHo Square as the name for the new development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Anna|title=Noho?

Planning permission for NoHo Square was granted in November 2007; however, the completion of demolition of the hospital in 2008 coincided with the collapse of Kaupthing as a result of the [[Financial crisis (2007–present)|2007-2008 global financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=07/09993/ADCAC {{!}} Details of demolition timing pursuant to Condition 1 of conservation area consent dated 19 October 2007 (RN: 07/01121). {{!}} Middlesex Hospital Mortimer Street London W1T 3AA|url=http://idoxpa.westminster.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&amp;keyVal=JRLSD4RP00400|publisher=Westminster City Council|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaupthing was the largest shareholder in the Guernsey-based consortium which bought the Middlesex site from [[University College Hospital]] in 2006, and with the bank in administration, the NoHo Square development stalled. As a result of CPC Group being partners with Kaupthing in another property development over in the US, the Candy brothers were able to transfer their equity stake in NoHo Square to the bank and in exchange take full control of the US development.&lt;ref name="keilthy1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bar-Hillel|first=Mira|title=Candy brothers lose millions of dollars on LA property deal that turned sour|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/7280129/Candy-brothers-lose-millions-of-dollars-on-LA-property-deal-that-turned-sour.html|accessdate=26 July 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=20 February 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Chelsea Barracks]] (2007)===

In April 2007, the Candy brothers acquired the [[Chelsea Barracks]] in a joint venture with [[Qatari Diar]], part of the Qatar government's investment arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Jerome|title=Young brothers behind Britain's record-breaking property deal|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/young-brothers-behind-britains-record-breaking-property-deal-776742.html|accessdate=1 February 2008|newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what is believed to be Britain's costliest residential property deal, the Candy brothers and the Qatari government have bought the 12.8-acre site from the Ministry of Defence for £959m.

===Beverly Hills 9900 Wilshire development (2008)===
In April 2007, the Candy brothers purchased – through CPC Group – an eight-acre site in [[Beverly Hills, California]], known as 9900 Wilshire, with their equity partners Kaupthing for a reported £250m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Daniel|title=Candy brothers buy Kaupthing property stakes|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a623828a-9663-11dd-9dce-000077b07658.html#axzz21kgxrY2n|accessdate=26 July 2012|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPC Group hired architect [[Richard Meier]] to design a condominium and retail complex in place of the former [[Robinsons-May]] department store.  Victor Bardack of the Beverly Hills North Homeowners Association said: "To put two huge projects on the already-impacted intersection of Santa Monica and Wilshire boulevards is grossly detrimental to the community,[...] It'll be gridlock forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vincent|first=Roger|title=In Beverly Hills, high end indeed|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/apr/11/business/fi-luxury11|accessdate=26 July 2012|newspaper=LA Times|date=11 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy stemmed from the Sheikh being part owner of a Middle Eastern newspaper that has been accused of being anti-Semitic and anti-American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jewish lobby threatens Candy brothers' US deal|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/jewish-lobby-threatens-candy-brothers-us-deal-874861.html|accessdate=26 July 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=23 July 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPC Group served a written notice of default on Kaupthing shortly after. In the same month, the situation was made worse when the acquisition loan to the project from [[Credit Suisse]] became past due, and, additionally, it became increasingly difficult to get financing on the 250 condominiums that the original plans catered for. This was due to the collapse of the property market and banks pulling their funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=9900 Wilshire Owners Cope With Iceland Chaos|url=http://bhcourier.com/9900-wilshire-owners-cope-with-iceland-chaos/2008/10/17|accessdate=26 July 2012|newspaper=The Beverly Hills Courier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karp|first=Jonathan|title=Beverly Hills Development Is in Doubt After Default|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122532158922982061?mod=residential_real_estate|accessdate=26 July 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later reported that CPC Group – after negotiating full control of the development from Kaupthing – defaulted on a US$365.5 million bank loan.&lt;ref name="keilthy1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph1" /&gt;

{{More footnotes|date =June 2016}}

A '''company''', abbreviated as '''co.''', is a [[Legal personality|legal entity]] made up of an [[Voluntary association|association]] of people, be they [[Natural person|natural]], [[Legal personality|legal]], or a mixture of both, for carrying on a [[Commerce|commercial]] or [[industry | industrial]] [[wiktionary:enterprise| enterprise]]. Company members share a common purpose, and unite to focus their various [[desire|talents]] and organize their collectively available [[skill]]s or [[resource]]s to achieve specific, declared [[goal]]s. Companies take various forms, such as:

* [[voluntary association]]s, which may include [[nonprofit organization]]s
* [[Companies law|business entities]] with an aim of gaining a [[Profit (economics)|profit]]
* [[Financial capital|financial entities]] and [[bank]]s

A company or association of persons can be created at [[law]] as a legal person so that the company in itself can accept [[limited liability]] for civil responsibility and taxation incurred as members perform (or fail to discharge) their [[duty]] within the [[Common knowledge|publicly declared]] ''[[Incorporation (business)|"birth certificate"]]'' or [[Publishing|published]] [[policy]].

Companies as legal persons may associate and register themselves collectively as other companies – often known as a [[corporate group]]. When a company closes, it may need a ''[[Liquidation|"death certificate"]]'' to avoid further legal obligations.

==Meanings and definitions==
A company can be defined as an "artificial person", invisible, intangible, created by or under law, with a discrete [[legal personality]], [[perpetual succession]], and a [[Company seal|common seal]].{{cn|date=October 2013}} It is not affected by the death, insanity, or [[insolvency]] of an individual member.

===Etymology===
The English word ''company'' has its origins in the [[Old French]] military term ''compagnie'' (first recorded in 1150), meaning a "body of soldiers",&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|company}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came from the [[Late Latin]] word ''companio'' ("one who eats bread with you"), first attested in the ''[[Salic law|Lex Salica]]'' as a calque of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] expression ''gahlaibo'' (literally, "with bread"), relGerman]] ''galeipo'' ("companion") and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''gahlaiba'' ("messmate"). By 1303, the word referred to [[Guild|trade guild]]s. Usage of the term ''company'' to mean "business association" was first recorded in 1553,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and the abbreviation "co." dates from 1769.

===United Kingdom===
In [[English law]] and in legal jurisdictions based upon it, a company is a [[Legal personality|body corporate]] or corporation company registered under the [[United Kingdom company law|Companies Acts]] or similar legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/1 Companies Act 2006, Section 1]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Common forms include:
* [[Private company limited by guarantee|Private companies limited by guarantee]]
* Companies without share capital (often [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] entities)
* [[Private company limited by shares|Private companies limited by shares]] - the most common form of company
* [[Public limited company|Public limited companies]] - companies, usually large, which are permitted to (but do not have to) offer their shares to the public, for example on a [[stock exchange]]

In the United Kingdom, a [[partnership]] is not legally a company, but may sometimes be referred to{{by whom?|date=October 2015}} informally as a company. It may be referred to as a [[Business|firm]].

===United States===
In the [[United States]], a company may be a "[[corporation]], [[partnership]], association, [[joint-stock company]], [[Investment trust|trust]], [[Mutual fund|fund]], or organized group of [[person]]s, whether incorporated or not, and (in an official capacity) any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, or similar official, or liquidating [[Law of agency|agent]], for any of the foregoing".&lt;ref name="Black's"&gt;Black's Law and lee Dictionary. Second Pocket Edition. Bryan A. Garner, editor. West. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the US, a company is not necessarily a corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/company|title=Company legal definition of company|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
{{for|a country-by-country listing|types of business entity}}

See also [[Business#Forms|types of business]]

*'''A [[Private company limited by guarantee|company limited by guarantee]]'''.  Commonly used where companies are formed for non-commercial purposes, such as clubs or charities.  The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts if the company goes into [[liquidation|insolvent liquidation]], but otherwise they have no economic rights in relation to the company. This type of company is common in [[England]]. A company limited by guarantee may be with or without having [[share capital]].
*'''A [[Private company limited by shares|company limited by shares]]'''.  The most common form of company used for business ventures. Specifically, a limited company is a "company in which the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount individually invested" with corporations being "the most common example of a limited company."&lt;ref name="Black's"/&gt; This type of company is common in [[England]] and many English-speaking countries. A company limited by shares may be a
**[[public company|publicly traded company]] or a
**[[privately held company]].
*'''A company limited by guarantee with a share capital'''.  A hybrid entity, usually used where the company is formed for non-commercial purposes, but the activities of the company are partly funded by investors who expect a return.  This type of company may no longer be formed in the UK, although provisions still exist in law for them to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Act 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''A [[limited liability company]]'''. "A company—statutorily authorized in certain states—that is characterized by limited liability, management by members or managers, and limitations on ownership transfer", i.e., L.L.C.&lt;ref name="Black's"/&gt; LLC structure has been called "hybrid" in that it "combines the characteristics of a corporation and of a partnership or sole proprietorship". Like a corporation, it has limited liability for members of the company, and like a partnership it has "flow-through taxation to the members" and must be "dissolved upon the death or bankruptcy of a member".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp#ixzz2CEzgE239|title=Limited Liability Company (LLC) Definition - Investopedia|author=root|work=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''An [[unlimited company]] with or without a share capital'''. A hybrid entity, a company where the liability of members or shareholders for the debts (if any) of the company are not limited. In this case doctrine of veil of incorporation does not apply.

''Less common types of companies are:''
*'''Companies formed by letters patent'''.  Most corporations by letters patent are ''[[corporation sole|corporations sole]]'' and not companies as the term is commonly understood today.
*'''[[Royal charter|Charter corporations]]'''.  Before the passing of modern companies legislation, these were the only types of companies.{{dubious|date=July 2018}}&lt;!-- even in the ancient Roman Republic? see [[Corporation#History]] --&gt;  Now they are relatively rare, except for very old companies that still survive (of which there are still many, particularly many British banks), or modern societies that fulfill a quasi regulatory function (for example, the [[Bank of England]] is a corporation formed by a modern charter).
*'''Statutory companies'''.  Relatively rare today, certain companies have been formed by a private statute passed in the relevant jurisdiction.

Note that "Ltd" after the company's name signifies a limited company, and "PLC" ([[public limited company]]) indicates that its shares are widely held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/z4br87h/revision/3|title=BBC Bitesize - GCSE Business - Forms of business ownership - Revision 3|website=BBC Bitesize|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In legal parlance, the owners of a company are normally referred to as the "members". In a company limited or unlimited by shares (formed or incorporated with a share capital), this will be the [[shareholder]]s. In a company limited by guarantee, this will be the guarantors. Some [[Offshore financial centre|offshore jurisdictions]] have created special forms of [[offshore company]] in a bid to attract business for their jurisdictions. Examples include "[[segregated portfolio company|segregated portfolio companies]]" and restricted purpose companies.

There are, however, many, many sub-categories of types of company that can be formed in various jurisdictions in the world.

Companies are also sometimes distinguished for legal and regulatory purposes between '''[[public limited company|public companies]]''' and '''[[privately held company|private companies]]'''. Public companies are companies whose shares can be publicly traded, often (although not always) on a [[stock exchange]] which imposes [[Listing (finance)|listing requirements]]/[[Listing Rules]] as to the issued shares, the trading of shares and future issue of shares to help bolster the reputation of the exchange or particular market of an exchange. Private companies do not have publicly traded shares, and often contain restrictions on transfers of shares. In some jurisdictions, private companies have maximum numbers of shareholders.

A [[parent company]] is a company that owns enough voting stock in another firm to control management and operations by influencing or electing its board of directors; the second company being deemed as a subsidiary of the parent company. The definition of a parent company differs by jurisdiction, with the definition normally being defined by way of laws dealing with companies in that jurisdiction.

The '''Darwin Awards''' are a [[tongue-in-cheek]] honor, originating in [[Usenet]] newsgroup discussions around 1985. They recognize individuals who have supposedly contributed to human [[evolution]] by [[natural selection|selecting]] themselves out of the [[gene pool]] via [[death]] or [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] by their own actions.

The project became more formalized with the creation of a [[website]] in 1993, and followed up by a series of [[book]]s starting in 2000, authored by Wendy Northcutt. The criterion for the awards states, "In the spirit of [[Charles Darwin]], the Darwin Awards commemorate individuals who protect our gene pool by making the ultimate sacrifice of their own lives. Darwin Award winners [[list of unusual deaths|eliminate themselves in an extraordinarily idiotic manner]], thereby improving our species' chances of long-term survival."&lt;ref name="history_and_rules"&gt;{{cite web|last=Northcutt|first=Wendy|title=History &amp; Rules|url=http://www.darwinawards.com/rules/rules1.html|publisher=www.darwinawards.com|accessdate=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accidental self-sterilization also qualifies; however, the site notes: "Of necessity, the award is usually bestowed posthumously." The candidate is disqualified, though, if "innocent bystanders", who might have contributed positively to the gene pool, are killed in the process.

The Darwin Awards books state that an attempt is made to disallow known [[urban legend]]s from the awards, but some older "winners" have been "[[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]]" to keep their awards. The Darwin Awards site does try to verify all submitted stories, but many similar sites, and the vast number of circulating "Darwin awards" emails, are largely fictional.

== History ==
[[File:Wendy Northcutt.jpg|thumb|right|Wendy Northcutt, author of the Darwin Awards website and books]]
The origin of the Darwin Awards can be traced back to posts on [[Usenet]] group discussions as early as 1985. An early post, on August 7, 1985, describes the awards as being, "given posthumously to people who have made the supreme sacrifice to keep their genes out of our [[gene pool|pool]]. Style counts, not everyone who dies from their own stupidity can win."&lt;ref name="Freeman_Andy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Freeman|first=Andy|title=Darwin Awards.|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!msg/net.bizarre/V5o__gcmIf0/fZ5sv2BvzAsJ%5B1-25%5D|accessdate=August 14, 2012|newspaper=[[Google groups]] archive of net.bizarre.|date=August 7, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early post cites an example of a person who pulled a [[vending machine]] over his head and was crushed to death trying to break into it.&lt;ref name="Freeman_Andy" /&gt; Another widely distributed early story mentioning the Darwin Awards is the [[JATO Rocket Car]], which describes a man who strapped a [[JATO|jet-assisted take-off]] unit to his [[Chevrolet Impala]] in the [[Arizona]] desert and who died on the side of a cliff as his car achieved speeds of {{convert|250|to|300|mph}}. This story was later confirmed to be an urban legend by the Arizona Department of Public Safety.&lt;ref name="Mikkelson_Barbara"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mikkelson|first=Barbara|title=Carmageddon.|url=http://www.snopes.com/autos/dream/jato.asp|accessdate=August 14, 2012|newspaper=[[Snopes]]|date=November 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official Darwin Awards website run by Northcutt does its best to confirm all stories submitted, listing them as, "confirmed true by Darwin." Many of the [[viral email]]s circulating the [[Internet]], however, are hoaxes and urban legends.&lt;ref name="Mikkelson_Barbara_2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mikkelson|first=Barbara|title=2004 Darwin Awards.|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/freakish/darwin04.asp|accessdate=August 14, 2012|newspaper=[[Snopes]]|date=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website and collection of books were started in 1993 by Wendy Northcutt, who at the time was a graduate in [[molecular biology]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="Rice_Stanley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rice|first=Stanley A.|title=Encyclopedia of Evolution|chapter=Darwin Awards|year=2007|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York |isbn=978-0-8160-5515-9|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRcAVvmE6eMC&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to study [[neurobiology]] at [[Stanford University]], doing research on [[cancer]] and [[telomerase]]. In her spare time, she organized [[chain letter]]s from family members into the original Darwin Awards website hosted in her personal account space at  Stanford. She eventually left the bench in 1998 and devoted herself full-time to her website and books in September 1999.&lt;ref name="Hawkins_John"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hawkins |first=John |title=A Conversation with Darwin (Webmaster of the Darwin Awards). |url=http://www.rightwingnews.com/interviews/darwin.php |accessdate=August 14, 2012 |newspaper=Right Wing News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622054043/http://www.rightwingnews.com/interviews/darwin.php |archivedate=June 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2002, the website received 7 million page hits per month.&lt;ref name="Clark_Doug"&gt;{{cite news|last=Clark |first=Doug |title=Let's hear it for natural selection. |url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/news-story.asp?date=111402&amp;ID=s1253392 |accessdate=September 18, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |date=November 14, 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203052123/http://www.spokesmanreview.com/news-story.asp?date=111402&amp;ID=s1253392 |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She encountered some difficulty in publishing the first book, since most publishers would only offer her a deal if she agreed to remove the stories from the Internet. Northcutt refused to do so, saying, "It was a community! I could not do that. Even though it might have cost me a lot of money, I kept saying no." She eventually found a publisher who agreed to print a book containing only 10% of the material gathered for the website. The first book turned out to be a success, and was listed on ''[[The New York Times]]'' bestseller list for six months.&lt;ref name="John_123reg"&gt;{{cite news|author=John|title=Pet porn, rocket cars and hand grenades.|url=http://www.123-reg.co.uk/blog/interviews/darwin-awards-pet-porn-and-hand-grenades/|accessdate=August 31, 2012|newspaper=123-reg|date=April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of the feedback from the stories Northcutt published was positive, and she occasionally received email from people who knew the deceased. One such person wrote, "This is horrible. It has shocked our community to the core. You should remove this." But Northcutt said "I can't. It's just too stupid." Northcutt kept the stories on the website and in her books, citing them as a "funny-but-true safety guide", and mentioning that children who read the book are going to be much more careful around explosives.&lt;ref name="CNN_interview"&gt;{{cite news|title='Darwin Awards' author dedicated to documenting macabre mishaps. |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-01-03/entertainment/darwin.awards_1_deaths-darwin-award-wendy-northcutt |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119105342/http://articles.cnn.com/2001-01-03/entertainment/darwin.awards_1_deaths-darwin-award-wendy-northcutt |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 19, 2013 |accessdate=September 18, 2012 |newspaper=[[CNN]] |date=January 3, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website also recognizes, with Honorable Mentions, individuals who survive their misadventures with their reproductive capacity intact. One example of this is [[Larry Walters|Lawnchair Larry]], who attached [[helium]]-filled [[weather balloon]]s to a lawn chair and floated far above [[Long Beach, California]], in July 1982. He reached an altitude of {{convert|16000|ft|m}} but survived, to be later fined for crossing [[controlled airspace]].&lt;ref name="Greany_Walker_Hecht"&gt;{{cite news |authors=Greany, Ed; Walker, Douglas; Hecht, Walter |title=Lawn Chair Larry |url=http://darwinawards.com/stupid/stupid1998-11.html |accessdate=August 14, 2012 |newspaper=www.darwinawards.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable honorable mention was given to the two men who attempted to burgle the home of footballer [[Duncan Ferguson]] (who had four convictions for assault and had served six months in Glasgow's [[Barlinnie Prison]]) in 2001, with one burglar requiring three days' hospitalization after being confronted by the player.&lt;ref name="McSean_Nash"&gt;{{cite news |authors=McSean, Tony; Nash, Pete |title=Ferguson 2, Thieves 0 |url=http://darwinawards.com/stupid/stupid2001-04.html |accessdate=August 14, 2012 |publisher=www.darwinawards.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study published in the [[British Medical Journal]] found that between 1995 and 2014 males represented 88.7% of Darwin Award winners (see figure).&lt;ref name=Lendrem&gt;{{Cite journal| doi=10.1136/bmj.g7094 |volume=349 |pages=g7094 |last1=Lendrem |first1=Ben Alexander Daniel |last2=Lendrem |first2=Dennis William |last3=Gray |first3=Andy |last4=Isaacs |first4=John Dudley |title=The Darwin Awards: sex differences in idiotic behaviour |journal=BMJ |date=December 11, 2014 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7094 |pmid=25500113 |accessdate=August 12, 2016 |pmc=4263959}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 [[comedy film]], ''[[The Darwin Awards (film)|The Darwin Awards]]'', written and directed by [[Finn Taylor]], was based on the website and many of  the Darwin Awards stories.

== Rules ==
Northcutt has stated five requirements for a Darwin Award:&lt;ref name="history_and_rules" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen_Suzy"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hansen |first=Suzy |title=The Darwin Awards |url=http://www.salon.com/2000/11/10/northcutt/ |accessdate=September 18, 2012 |newspaper=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=November 10, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inability to reproduce ===
;Nominee must be dead or rendered sterile
This may be subject to dispute. Potential awardees may be out of the gene pool because of age; others have already reproduced before their deaths. To avoid debates about the possibility of [[in-vitro fertilization]], [[artificial insemination]], or [[human cloning|cloning]], the original Darwin Awards book applied the following "deserted island" test to potential winners: If the person were unable to reproduce when stranded on a deserted island with a fertile member of the opposite sex, he or she would be considered sterile.&lt;ref name="book_one"&gt;{{cite book |last=Northcutt |first=Wendy |title=The Darwin Awards: Evolution in Action |year=2000 |publisher=PLUME (The Penguin Group) |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-525-94572-7 |pages=2–6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Cowke97r_IkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=darwin+awards#v=onepage&amp;q=darwin%20awards&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winners of the award, in general, either are dead or have become unable to use their [[sexual organs]].

=== Excellence ===
;Astoundingly stupid judgment
The candidate's foolishness must be unique and sensational, likely because the award is intended to be funny. A number of foolish but common activities, such as smoking in bed, are excluded from consideration. In contrast, [[self-immolation]] caused by smoking after being administered a flammable ointment in a hospital and specifically told not to smoke is grounds for nomination.&lt;ref name="stubbed_out"&gt;{{cite web |author1=C.J. |author2=Malcolm, Andrew |author3=Sims, Iain |author4=Beeston, Richard. |title=Stubbed Out |url=http://darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin2006-06.html |publisher=www.darwinawards.com |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One "Honorable Mention" (a man who attempted suicide by swallowing [[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|nitroglycerine pills]], and then tried to detonate them by running into a wall) is noted to be in this category, despite being intentional and self-inflicted (i.e. attempted [[suicide]]), which would normally disqualify the inductee.&lt;ref name="Cawcutt_Tom"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cawcutt |first=Tom |title=Phenomenal Failure |url=http://darwinawards.com/stupid/stupid2001-24.html |publisher=www.darwinawards.com |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-selection ===
;Cause of one's own demise
Killing a friend with a [[hand grenade]] would not be eligible, but killing oneself while manufacturing a homemade [[chimney]]-cleaning device from a grenade would be eligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Northcutt, Wendy |title=Chimney-Cleaning Grenade |url=http://darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin2005-09.html |publisher=www.darwinawards.com |year=2005 |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To earn a Darwin Award, one must have killed oneself, or rendered oneself sterile; merely causing death to a third party is insufficient.

=== Maturity ===
;Capable of sound judgment
The nominee must be at least past the legal driving age and free of [[intellectual disability|mental defect]] (Northcutt considers injury or death caused by mental defect to be tragic, rather than amusing, and routinely disqualifies such entries). After much discussion,  a small category regarding deaths below this age limit also exists. Entry into this category requires that the peers of the candidate be of the opinion that the actions of the person in question were above and beyond the limits of reason.

However, in 2011, the awards targeted a 16-year-old boy in Leeds who died stealing copper wiring (the standard minimum driving age in Great Britain being 17). In 2012, Northcutt made similar light of a 14-year-old girl in Brazil who was killed while leaning out of a school bus window; however, she was "disqualified" for the award itself because of the likely public objection due to the girl's age, which Northcutt asserts is based on "[[magical thinking]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homoeconomicusnet.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/darwin-awards-2012-too-young-to-include/|title=Darwin Awards 2012 – too young to include?|date=10 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Veracity ===
;Event must be verified
The story must be documented by reliable sources: e.g., reputable newspaper articles, confirmed television reports, or responsible eyewitnesses.  If a story is found to be untrue, it is disqualified, but particularly amusing ones are placed in the [[urban legend]] section of the archives.  Despite this requirement, many of the stories are fictional, often appearing as "original submissions" and presenting no further sources than unverified (and unreliable) "eyewitnesses". Most such stories on Northcutt's Darwin Awards site are filed in the Personal Accounts section.

In addition, later revisions to the qualification criteria add several requirements that have not been made into formalized 'rules': innocent bystanders cannot be in danger, and the qualifying event 'must' be caused without deliberate intent (to prevent glory-seekers from purposely injuring themselves solely to win a Darwin).

==Biography==
===Early life===
Martin was born in [[Tucson, Arizona]], on April 19, 1930.&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt; His father, Hawley Phillips Martin, worked as the director of [[advertising]] and [[communications]] for the [[Southern States Cooperative]] and later became the Richmond branch of a Washington D.C. ad agency.&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt; He attended [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Richmond, Virginia)|Thomas Jefferson High School]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. Martin obtained his [[bachelor's degree]] in social science in 1952 from [[Hampden–Sydney College]] in [[Hampden Sydney, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt;

===Career===
Martin's career after college began as an editorial cartoonist for a newspaper published once a week.&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt; He then joined the staff of VanSant Dugdale, an ad agency based in [[Baltimore]], where he drew storyboards and wrote scripts for [[television commercial]]s.&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt; He briefly worked in New York City during his early career, where he worked as a [[television producer]], creating live content for ''[[The Today Show]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' on [[NBC]].&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt;

He moved back to Richmond, Virginia, in 1956 to take a position with Cargill &amp; Wilson. Martin was promoted to  partner and vice president of [[account services]] within the company.&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt;

Martin and business partner, George Woltz, founded their ad agency, [[Martin &amp; Woltz]], in 1965.&lt;ref name=adage/&gt; In 1975, Martin and Woltz agreed to divide the firm, which Martin renamed [[The Martin Agency]].&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt; His company Martin's until 1986, when The Martin Agency was sold to [[Scali, McCabe, Sloves]].&lt;ref name=adage/&gt; (In turn, Scali, McCabe, Sloves was later acquired by the [[Interpublic Group of Companies]]).&lt;ref name=adage/&gt; David Martin retired from The Martin Agency in 1988, two years after selling the ad agency.&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt;

Martin is perhaps best known as the "[[Idea|brainchild]]" behind the famous ''[[Virginia is for Lovers]]'' tourism campaign, which was first launched in 1969.&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt;&lt;ref name=adage/&gt; He was a member of the team which created the slogan. Martin publicly credited [[Robin McLaughlin]], an advertising [[copyeditor]], with writing the original [[tagline]], "Virginia is for history lovers."&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt; Martin approved of McLaughlin's work, but suggested that they omit the word "history" from the slogan.&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt; The rest of the advertising team agreed with Martin's suggestion, leading to the iconic ''Virginia is for Lovers'' campaign.&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt;

He remained in advertising after leaving The Martin Agency. He soon opened a new agency, Hawley Martin Partners, with his brother, Stephen H. "Steve" Martin.&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt; The firm was named for their father. Martin served the agency's creative plans director and chairman, while Steve Martin was the company's president and [[CEO]].&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt; Interpublic Group acquired Hawley Martin Partners in 1993. Interpublic merged it with Fahlgren and renamed the new agency, which was based in [[Atlanta]], as Fahlgren Martin.&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt; Fahlgren Martin was next purchased by [[Arnold Worldwide]] in 1995, which combined it Finnegan &amp; Agee, another acquisition, to create  Arnold Finnegan Martin.&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt; 

While Martin largely retired from advertising in 1995 to pursue writing and painting, he continued to partner with  his sons for other ventures.&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt; In 1999, Martin co-founded and served as the chairman of Martin Branding Worldwide with his son, Rob Martin.&lt;ref name=adage/&gt; One year later, Martin launched another company, BrandSync, with his younger son, Dave H. Martin, in 2000.&lt;ref name=adage/&gt;

He also served as a regional head for [[Associated Actors and Artistes of America]] (4As), a [[performing arts]] [[trade union]] federation.&lt;ref name=adage/&gt;

Martin died from cancer on October 2, 2012, at the age of 82.&lt;ref name=adage/&gt; he was survived by his wife, Ann Louise; four children - Sarah Martin Herguner, Susan Mitchell, Robert Martin and David Martin; and nine grandchildren.

===Recognitions===
Martin received many awards and recognitions during his career. The Richmond Ad Club named him "Advertising Person of the Year" in 1969, the same year that the ''Virginia is for Lovers'' ad campaign was launched.&lt;ref name=adage/&gt; [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] also inducted him into its  Mass Communications Hall of Fame in 1987.&lt;ref name=adage/&gt; In 2012, a portrait of Martin by Louis Briel, an artist from Richmond, was added to the collection of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in [[Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt;

===Painting and writing===
Martin also pursued writing. He published two books specifically dealing with [[marketing]] and [[brand]]ing - "Romancing the Brand" and "Be the Brand: How to Find a Powerful Identity and Use It to Drive Sales."&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt; He also wrote and released two [[novels]], "Under a Lemon Moon" and "Where the Whores Dance at Midnight."&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt;

He also began painting after working with painter and illustrator [[Norman Rockwell]] on an ad campaign for [[Colonial Williamsburg]]. Martin painted approximately eighty pieces during his life.&lt;ref name=rtd/&gt;

In [[microeconomics]], '''economies of scale''' are the cost advantages that  enterprises obtain due to their scale of operation (typically measured by amount of output produced), with cost per unit of output decreasing with increasing scale. (In economics, "scale" is synonymous with quantity.)

Economies of scale apply to a variety of organizational and business situations and at various levels, such as a business or manufacturing unit, plant or an entire enterprise. When average costs start falling as output increases, then economies of scale are occurring. If a firm's [[Marginal_cost|marginal cost]] of producing a good or service is beneath its [[Average_cost|average cost]] of producing that good or service, then the firm is experiencing economies of scale.
Some economies of scale, such as capital cost of manufacturing facilities and friction loss of transportation and industrial equipment, have a [[Economies of scale#Physical and engineering basis|physical or engineering basis]].

Another source of scale economies is the possibility of purchasing inputs at a lower per-unit cost when they are purchased in large quantities.

The economic concept dates back to [[Adam Smith]] and the idea of obtaining larger production returns through the use of division of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Economies of scale often have limits, such as passing the optimum design point where costs per additional unit begin to increase.  Common limits include exceeding the nearby raw material supply, such as wood in the lumber, [[pulp and paper industry]]. A common limit for low cost per unit weight commodities is saturating the regional market, thus having to ship product uneconomical distances. Other limits include using energy less efficiently or having a higher defect rate.

Large producers are usually efficient at long runs of a product grade (a commodity) and find it costly to switch grades frequently.  They will therefore avoid specialty grades even though they have higher margins.  Often smaller (usually older) manufacturing facilities remain viable by changing from commodity grade production to specialty products.&lt;ref&gt;Manufacture of specialty grades by small scale producers is a common practice in steel, paper and many commodity industries today.  See various industry trade publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Overview==
The simple meaning of economies of scale is doing things more efficiently with increasing size or speed of operation.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Economies of scale often rely on [[fixed cost]]s, which are constant and don't vary with output, and [[Variable cost|variable costs]], which can be affected with the amount of output. In wholesale and retail distribution, increasing the speed of operations, such as order fulfillment, lowers the cost of both fixed and [[working capital]]. Other common sources of economies of scale are [[Purchase|purchasing]] (bulk buying of materials through long-term contracts), managerial (increasing the specialization of managers), financial (obtaining lower-[[interest]] charges when borrowing from banks and having access to a greater range of financial instruments), [[marketing]] (spreading the cost of advertising over a greater range of output in [[media market]]s), and technological (taking advantage of [[returns to scale]] in the production function). Each of these factors reduces the [[long run average cost]]s (LRAC) of production by shifting the [[cost curve|short-run average total cost (SRATC) curve]] down and to the right.

Economies of scale is a practical concept that may explain real-world phenomena such as patterns of international trade or the number of firms in a market. The exploitation of economies of scale helps explain why companies grow large in some industries. It is also a justification for [[free trade]] policies, since some economies of scale may require a larger market than is possible within a particular country—for example, it would not be efficient for [[Liechtenstein]] to have its own carmaker if they only sold to their local market. A lone carmaker may be profitable, but even more so if they exported cars to global markets in addition to selling to the local market. Economies of scale also play a role in a "[[natural monopoly]]". There is a distinction between two types of economies of scale: internal and external. An industry that exhibits an internal economy of scale is one where the costs of production fall when the number of firms in the industry drops, but the remaining firms increase their production to match previous levels. Conversely, an industry exhibits an external economy of scale when costs drop due to the introduction of more firms, thus allowing for more efficient use of specialized services and machinery. 

The management thinker and translator of the [[Toyota Production System]] for service, Professor [[John Seddon]], argues that attempting to create economies by increasing scale is powered by myth in the service sector. Instead, he believes that economies will come from improving the flow of a service, from the first receipt of a customer’s demand to the eventual satisfaction of that demand. In trying to manage and reduce unit costs, firms often raise total costs by creating [[failure demand]]. Seddon claims that arguments for an economy of scale are a mix of (a) the plausibly obvious and (b) a little hard data, brought together to produce two broad assertions, for which there is little hard factual evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/connected_republic/attachments/33/Why_do_we_believe_in_economy_of_scale.pdf|format=PDF|title=Why do we believe in economy of scale? : Professor John Seddon, managing director Vanguard|date=July 2010|website=S3.amazonaws.com|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical and engineering basis==
Some of the economies of scale recognized in engineering have a physical basis, such as the [[square-cube law]], by which the surface of a vessel increases by the square of the dimensions while the volume increases by the cube.  This law has a direct effect on the capital cost of such things as buildings, factories, pipelines, ships and airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;See various estimating guides, such as Means.  Also see various engineering economics texts related to plant design and construction, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In structural engineering, the strength of [[Beam (structure)|beam]]s increases with the cube of the thickness.

[[Drag (physics)|Drag]] loss of vehicles like aircraft or ships generally increases less than proportional with increasing cargo volume, although the physical details can be quite complicated. Therefore, making them larger usually results in less fuel consumption per ton of cargo at a given speed.

Heat losses from industrial processes vary per unit of volume for pipes, tanks and other vessels in a relationship somewhat similar to the square-cube law.&lt;ref&gt;The relationship is rather complex.  See engineering texts on heat transfer.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capital and operating cost===

Overall costs of capital projects are known to be subject to economies of scale.  A crude estimate is that if the capital cost for a given sized piece of equipment is known, changing the size will change the capital cost by the 0.6 power of the capacity ratio (the point six power rule).&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In practice, capital cost estimates are prepared from specifications, budget grade vendor pricing for equipment, general arrangement drawings and materials take-offs from the drawings.  This information is then used in cost formulas to arrive at a final detailed estimate.&lt;/ref&gt;

In estimating capital cost, it typically requires an insignificant amount of labor, and possibly not much more in materials, to install a larger capacity electrical wire or pipe having significantly greater capacity.&lt;ref&gt;See various estimating guides that publish tables of tasks commonly encountered in building trades with estimates of labor hours and costs per hour for the trade, often with regional pricing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of a unit of capacity of many types of equipment, such as electric motors, centrifugal pumps, diesel and gasoline engines, decreases as size increases.  Also, the efficiency increases with size.&lt;ref&gt;See various engineering handbooks and manufacturers data.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crew size and other operating costs for ships, trains and airplanes===

Operating crew size for ships, airplanes, trains, etc., does not increase in direct proportion to capacity.&lt;ref&gt;

Many aircraft models were significantly lengthened or "stretched" to increase payload.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosenberg|1982|pp=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many manufacturing facilities, especially those making bulk materials like chemicals, refined petroleum products, cement and paper, have labor requirements that are not greatly influenced by changes in plant capacity.  This is because labor requirements of automated processes tend to be based on the complexity of the operation rather than production rate, and many manufacturing facilities have nearly the same basic number of processing steps and pieces of equipment, regardless of production capacity.

===Economical use of byproducts===

[[Karl Marx]] noted that large scale manufacturing allowed economical use of products that would otherwise be waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosenberg|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marx cited the chemical industry as an example, which today along with petrochemicals, remains highly dependent on turning various residual reactant streams into salable products.  In the pulp and paper industry it is economical to burn bark and fine wood particles to produce [[process steam]] and to recover the spent pulping chemicals for conversion back to a usable form.

==Economies of scale and returns to scale==

Economies of scale is related to and can easily be confused with the theoretical economic notion of returns to scale.  Where economies of scale refer to a firm's costs, returns to scale describe the relationship between inputs and outputs in a long-run (all inputs variable) production function. A production function has ''constant'' returns to scale if increasing all inputs by some proportion results in output increasing by that same proportion. Returns are ''decreasing'' if, say, doubling inputs results in less than double the output, and ''increasing'' if more than double the output.  If a mathematical function is used to represent the production function, and if that production function is [[homogeneous function|homogeneous]], returns to scale are represented by the degree of homogeneity of the function.  Homogeneous production functions with constant returns to scale are first degree homogeneous, increasing returns to scale are represented by degrees of homogeneity greater than one, and decreasing returns to scale by degrees of homogeneity less than one.

If the firm is a perfect competitor in all input markets, and thus the per-unit prices of all its inputs are unaffected by how much of the inputs the firm purchases, then it can be shown that at a particular level of output, the firm has economies of scale if and only if it has increasing returns to scale, has diseconomies of scale if and only if it has decreasing returns to scale, and has neither economies nor diseconomies of scale if it has constant returns to scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gelles |first=Gregory M. |last2=Mitchell |first2=Douglas W. |title=Returns to Scale and Economies of Scale: Further Observations |journal=Journal of Economic Education |volume=27 |date=1996 |issue=3 |pages=259–261 |jstor=1183297 |doi=10.1080/00220485.1996.10844915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frisch |first=R. |authorlink=Ragnar Frisch |title=Theory of Production |location=Dordrecht |publisher=D. Reidel |date=1965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=C. E. |title=The Neoclassical Theory of Production &amp;amp; Distribution |location=London |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1969 |isbn=0-521-07453-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case, with [[perfect competition]] in the output market the long-run equilibrium will involve all firms operating at the minimum point of their long-run average cost curves (i.e., at the borderline between economies and diseconomies of scale).

If, however, the firm is not a perfect competitor in the input markets, then the above conclusions are modified.  For example, if there are increasing returns to scale in some range of output levels, but the firm is so big in one or more input markets that increasing its purchases of an input drives up the input's per-unit cost, then the firm could have diseconomies of scale in that range of output levels.  Conversely, if the firm is able to get bulk discounts of an input, then it could have economies of scale in some range of output levels even if it has decreasing returns in production in that output range.

The literature assumed that due to the competitive nature of [[reverse auction]]s, and in order to compensate for lower prices and lower margins, suppliers seek higher volumes to maintain or increase the total revenue. Buyers, in turn, benefit from the lower transaction costs and economies of scale that result from larger volumes. In part as a result, numerous studies have indicated that the procurement volume must be sufficiently high to provide sufficient profits to attract enough suppliers, and provide buyers with enough savings to cover their additional costs.&lt;ref name="ShalevAsbjornsen2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shalev |first=Moshe Eitan |last2=Asbjornsen |first2=Stee |title=Electronic Reverse Auctions and the Public Sector – Factors of Success |journal=Journal of Public Procurement |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=428–452 |date=2010 |ssrn=1727409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, surprisingly enough, Shalev and Asbjornse found, in their research based on 139 reverse auctions conducted in the public sector by public sector buyers, that the higher auction volume, or economies of scale, did not lead to better success of the auction. They found that auction volume did not correlate with competition, nor with the number of bidders, suggesting that auction volume does not promote additional competition. They noted, however, that their data included a wide range of products, and the degree of competition in each market varied significantly, and offer that further research on this issue should be conducted to determine whether these findings remain the same when purchasing the same product for both small and high volumes. Keeping competitive factors constant, increasing auction volume may further increase competition.&lt;ref name="ShalevAsbjornsen2010" /&gt;

== Distributional consequences ==
In his 1844 ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844|Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts]]'', [[Karl Marx]] observes that economies of scale have historically been associated with an increasing concentration of private wealth and have been used to justify such concentration. Marx points out that concentrated private ownership of large-scale economic enterprises is a historically contingent fact, and not essential to the nature of such enterprises. In the case of agriculture, for example, Marx calls attention to the [[wikt:sophistry|sophistical]] nature of the arguments used to justify the system of concentrated ownership of land:

: As for large landed property, its defenders have always sophistically identified the economic advantages offered by large-scale agriculture with large-scale landed property, as if it were not precisely as a result of the abolition of property that this advantage, for one thing, received its greatest possible extension, and, for another, only then would be of social benefit.&lt;ref name=marx1844&gt;[[Karl Marx]], ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'', M. Milligan, trans. (1988), p. 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of concentrated private ownership of land, Marx recommends that economies of scale should instead be realized by [[Cooperative|associations]]:

:Association, applied to land, shares the economic advantage of large-scale landed property, and first brings to realization the original tendency inherent in land-division, namely, equality. In the same way association re-establishes, now on a rational basis, no longer mediated by serfdom, overlordship and the silly mysticism of property, the intimate ties of man with the earth, for the earth ceases to be an object of huckstering, and through free labor and free enjoyment becomes once more a true personal property of man.&lt;ref name=marx1844/&gt;

The '''electronic receipt''' or '''e-receipt''' is an electronic [[Receipt]] of any product or service that was purchased.

== Implementation ==
Digital receipts are normally sent via e-mail or via an app. Unlike paper receipts, e-receipts are used to reduce paper usage. These e-receipts are used to inform the customer of rebates and discounts. Another important purpose is to use the digital receipts as marketing instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Perring |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/639219/Ereceipts-British-shops-shopping-electronic-Internet |title=Retailers are now monitoring YOUR shopping habits and transactions with the eReceipt... |work=[[Daily Express#Sunday Express]] |date=2016-01-29 |accessdate=2016-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for the use of e-receipts is [[Business Intelligence]]. Through the usage of these e-receipts, companies can track their customers easier in terms of purchases, which supports the Business intelligence. Through this companies can adapt their marketing campaign towards the customers. The e-receipt helps to connect customers to their in-store purchases. Merchants can issue E-receipts using own mechanisms or use external services specialized on electronic payments. One of such providers is Square Inc. Ecoslips.com provides an integrated solution to retailers, payment providers and EFTPOS platforms to send digital receipts to consumer cell phones. They've come up with a unique architecture to automate electronic receipts receipts without the need to share any personal information or credit card tokens. Other companies are specialized in E-receipt aggregation allowing a consumer to see all E-receipts, in one place, for example WalletWizz Inc.

Possible ways of distributing the email receipts may be to send an [[e-mail]], an [[Mobile app|app]] or a [[website]]/[[Web application|web app]]. The general idea of the e-receipt remains the same, there are only different ways of distribution. There are many different companies that already offer their customers e-receipts. In the following part these different companies and technologies are compared and their pros and cons are discussed.

'''Esso''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|s|oʊ}} (stylized as '''Ɛsso''') is a trading name for [[ExxonMobil]] and its related companies. The name is the phonetic pronunciation of the initials 'S' and 'O' in the name [[Standard Oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History &amp;#124; Esso and Mobil|url=https://www.esso.ca/en/our-history}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began as [[Standard Oil of New Jersey]] following the breakup of Standard Oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Falola  |first=Toyin |date=30 Sep 2005 |title=The Politics of the Global Oil Industry: An Introduction |location=Westport, CT |publisher=Praeger |page=27 |isbn=978-0275984007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the name was largely replaced in the U.S. by the [[Exxon]] brand after the company bought [[Humble Oil]], while the Esso name remained widely used elsewhere.

In most of the world, the Esso brand and the [[Mobil]] brand are the primary brand names of ExxonMobil, with the Exxon brand name still in use only in the United States alongside Mobil.

== History ==
In 1911, Standard Oil was [[Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States|broken up]] into 34 companies, some of which were named "Standard Oil" and had the rights to that brand in certain states (the other companies had no territorial rights). Standard Oil Company ([[New Jersey]]) ("Jersey Standard") had the rights in that state, plus in [[Maryland]], [[West Virginia]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], and the [[District of Columbia]]. By 1941, it had also acquired the rights in [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], [[Arkansas]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Louisiana]]. In those states, it marketed its products under the brand "Esso", the acronym for "Eastern States Standard Oil".

It also used the Esso brand in [[New York (state)|New York]] and the six [[New England]] states, where the Standard Oil Company of New York ([[Socony-Vacuum Oil Company|Socony-Vacuum, later Socony Mobil]]) had the rights, but did not object to the New Jersey company's use of the trademark{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} (the two companies did not merge [[ExxonMobil#Merger|until November 1999]]). However, in the other states, the other Standard Oil companies objected and, via a 1937 U.S. federal court injunction, forced Jersey Standard to use other brand names.&lt;ref name="CSP"/&gt; In most states the company used the trademark [[Enco (oil company)|Enco]] ("Energy Company"), and in a few "Humble".

The other Standard companies likewise were "Standard" or some variant on that in their home states, and another brand name in other states. Esso ranked 31st among United States corporations in the value of [[World War II]] production contracts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] &amp; [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.619&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years of [[racial segregation in the United States]], certain Esso franchises gave out ''[[The Negro Motorist Green Book]]: An International Travel Guide''.&lt;ref name="nytopen"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Open Road Wasn’t Quite Open to All |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/books/23green.html?pagewanted=all |publisher = [[The New York Times]] |date= August 22, 2010 | first=Celia | last=McGee  |accessdate= April 25, 2011 |quote=Although [[Victor H. Green|Victor Green’s]] initial edition only encompassed metropolitan New York, the ''Green Book'' soon expanded.... The 15,000 copies Green eventually printed each year were sold as a marketing tool not just to black-owned businesses but to the white marketplace, implying that it made good economic sense to take advantage of the growing affluence and mobility of African Americans. Esso stations, unusual in franchising to African Americans, were a popular place to pick one up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Standard Oil of New Jersey renamed itself as the Exxon Corporation, and adopted that trademark throughout the country. It maintained the rights to "Standard" and "Esso" in the states where it held those rights, by a token effort, by selling "Esso Diesel" in those states at stations that sell [[diesel fuel]], thus preventing the [[trademark]] from being declared abandoned.

It retained the "Esso" brand in [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands]] until 2008, when it sold its stations there to [[Total S.A.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.virginislandsdailynews.com/index.pl/article_home?id=17621796|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313160823/http://www.virginislandsdailynews.com/index.pl/article_home?id=17621796|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 13, 2008|title=Total Petroleum to take over Esso's fuel business in V.I.|last=Lett|first=Christine|date=March 11, 2008|work=[[The Virgin Islands Daily News]]|accessdate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enco brand name was used on locations in the Midwest until 1977 when they were sold to Cheker Oil Co. (now part of [[Marathon Petroleum]] subsidiary [[Speedway LLC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.marathonpetroleum.com/content/documents/mpc/about/MarathonMarketingHistory.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917194246/http://www.marathonpetroleum.com/content/documents/mpc/about/MarathonMarketingHistory.pdf |archive-date=September 17, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;); Exxon continues to have a presence in [[Appalachian Ohio|southern Ohio]] today (as it does throughout much of [[Appalachia]] in general), though [[Mobil]] is the company's primary brand in the Midwest.

In February 2016, ExxonMobil successfully asked a U.S. federal court to lift the 1930s trademark injunction that banned it from using the Esso brand in certain states. By this time, as a result of numerous mergers and rebranding, the remaining Standard Oil companies that previously objected to the Esso name had been acquired by [[BP]].

ExxonMobil cited trademark surveys in which there was no longer possible confusion with the Esso name as it was more than seven decades before. BP also had no objection to lift the ban.&lt;ref name="CSP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cspdailynews.com/industry-news-analysis/corporate-news/articles/return-esso-gasoline|title=The Return of Esso Gasoline?|date=February 16, 2016|publisher=CSP Daily News| accessdate=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ExxonMobil did not specify whether they would now open new stations in the U.S. under the Esso name; they were primarily concerned about the additional expenses of having separate marketing, letterheads, packaging, and other materials that omit "Esso".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.law360.com/articles/740293/after-78-years-exxon-asks-court-to-use-esso-name-again|title=After 78 Years, Exxon Asks Court To Use 'Esso' Name Again|date=December 21, 2015|publisher=CSP Daily News| accessdate=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Esso gas station finland.png|thumb|In Tampere, Finland (2007)]]

=== Esso Blue ===
Esso Blue was the brand name of Esso's [[Kerosene|paraffin oil]] (kerosene) for domestic heaters in countries such as the United Kingdom. Their television advertising song from the 1950s, through to the 1970s, was the famous "Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Esso Blue!"

One campaign used the well-known song tune of "[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]]" reworded as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link =  | title = the great blue singer&amp;nbsp;— Esso Blue flexi disk recording | publisher = Juzp | url = http://www.juzp.net/lLqmmK99cYnOl | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130221163649/http://www.juzp.net/lLqmmK99cYnOl | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2013-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "They asked me how I knew, it was Esso Blue, I of course replied, with lower grades one buys, smoke gets in your eyes. The non-smoking paraffin".
The track was released as a flexi disk which was given away free in hardware stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Discogs release |2778846 |The Great Blue Singer |type=single }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cleveland ===
In the 1930s, Esso acquired [[Cleveland (petrol)|Cleveland]], an independent company based in North East England. The name comes from the fact that the founder and principal shareholder, Norman Davis, spent some of World War I with his brother Manuel in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. Cleveland's products included a [[benzole]] blend and an [[Alcohol fuel|alcohol]] blend called "Discol". The Esso and Cleveland names continued in use until 1973, when the Cleveland filling stations were re-branded as Esso.

===Northern Ireland===
Esso traded in [[Northern Ireland]] up until the early 2000s. Their forecourts were re-branded as [[Maxol]] and some remained private.

===Euro Garages===
45 of Euro Garages' forecourts were bought from Esso in 2013, and are operated under the Esso brand. They plan to roll out partner brands such as [[Starbucks]] and [[Spar (retailer)|Spar]], replacing the Esso branded shops.

===Shop and Drive===
Shop and Drive is an Esso branded convenience store operated in some stations, although many of their locations have franchised shops such as [[Nisa (retailer)|Nisa]].

== Affiliates ==

=== Canada ===
{{main|Imperial Oil}}
[[File:ESSOMarkham8291Woodbine.jpg|thumb|ESSO in Ontario]]
In Canada, the Esso brand is used on stations operated by Imperial Oil, which is 69.8% owned by ExxonMobil. Esso also provides aviation fuel services at 80 airport locations in Canada (Aviation and Avitat).

=== Australia ===
{{main|Esso Australia}}
In Australia, Esso is an affiliate of ExxonMobil, it operates oil and gas production. Its retail petrol stations were acquired by [[Mobil#Mobil Australia|Mobil Australia]] in 1990.

=== Japan ===
[[File:Esso otesuji.jpg |thumb|In Kyoto, Japan (2017)]]
Established as Esso Standard Oil (Japan) in 1962 with Standard Vacuum division in Japan. It became Esso Oil in 1982. After the Exxon and Mobil merger in 1999, the Japanese subsidiaries were reorganized as ExxonMobil [[Yūgen_gaisha|Y.K.]] in 2002, later renamed to EMG Marketing in 2012 and acquired as a subsidiary by TonenGeneral Oil in the same year. In 2016 JX Holdings and the TonenGeneral Group merged into [[JXTG Holdings]], leading to the dissolution and absorption of EMG Marketing into a subsidiary of the new company, [[JXTG Nippon Oil &amp; Energy]], in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.noe.jxtg-group.co.jp/english/company/history/tg.html&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, ExxonMobil's Esso and Mobil brands are planned to be migrated to JX's ENEOS brand in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://response.jp/article/2017/09/06/299448.html |title=JXTG、2019年度中に「ENEOS」にブランドを統一　「エッソ／モービル／ゼネラル」は廃止 |language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Branding ==
Esso is ExxonMobil's primary gasoline brand worldwide except in Australia, Guam, Mexico (starting in about the first quarter of 2018), Nigeria and New Zealand, where the Mobil brand is used exclusively. In Canada (since 2017), Colombia, Egypt, Japan (until 2020) and formerly Malaysia, both the Esso and Mobil brands are used. While Esso and Mobil in Malaysia were rebranded as [[Petron]] in 2013, Esso and Mobil in Japan will be rebranded as [[ENEOS]] in 2020, since the acquisition of Esso and Mobil from [[JXTG Nippon Oil &amp; Energy]] in 2017.

Mobil is ExxonMobil's primary retail gasoline brand in California, Florida, New York, New England, the Great Lakes and the Midwest. Exxon is the primary brand in the rest of the United States, with the highest concentration of retail outlets located in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states.

== Advertising campaigns ==
In the 1960s, campaigns featuring heavy spending in different mass media channels became more prominent. Esso spent hundreds of millions of dollars on a brand awareness campaign built around the simple and [[alliteration|alliterative]]&lt;ref name=twsOctS1565&gt;{{cite news

The North American and later European campaign featured extensive television and radio and magazine ads, including photos with tiger tails supposedly emerging from car gas tanks, in England there were faux tiger tails with pink ribbons to tie round underneath the cap of the petrol tank so as to look as if there was a tiger in the tank: these were often seen on the road in the 1960s; at one time in England there was a television advertisement where a sombre man labelled as the advertising manager said that they were no longer going to have the tiger, followed a short while later with advertisements for the save the tiger campaign, promotional events featuring real tigers, billboards, and in Europe station pump hoses "wrapped in tiger stripes" as well as pop music songs.&lt;ref name=twsOctS155&gt;{{cite news

{{nihongo|'''Genichi Taguchi'''|田口 玄一|Taguchi Gen'ichi}} (January 1, 1924 – June 2, 2012) was an [[engineer]] and [[statistician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiusa.com/thought-leadership/news-and-events/167-death-of-dr-taguchi |title=ASI Mourns the Loss of Dr. Genichi Taguchi |publisher=Asiusa.com |date=2012-03-28 |accessdate=2012-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019015145/http://www.asiusa.com/thought-leadership/news-and-events/167-death-of-dr-taguchi |archivedate=2012-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1950s onwards, Taguchi developed a methodology for applying [[statistics]] to improve the quality of manufactured goods. [[Taguchi methods]] have been controversial among some conventional Western statisticians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wadsworth |first=Harrison M. |title=Handbook of statistical methods for engineers and scientists |edition=2nd |year=1997 |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Gerald F. |title=Quality problem solving |year=1998 |publisher=American Society for Quality |pages=250?251}}&lt;/ref&gt; but others have accepted many of the concepts introduced by him as valid extensions to the body of knowledge.

==Biography==

Taguchi was born and raised in the textile town of [[Tokamachi, Niigata|Tokamachi]], in [[Niigata prefecture]]. He initially studied textile [[engineering]] at [[Gunma University|Kiryu Technical College]] with the intention of entering the family [[kimono]] business.&lt;ref name="asqbio"&gt;{{cite web |title=Genichi Taguchi |url=http://www.asq.org/about-asq/who-we-are/bio_taguchi.html |publisher=American Society for Quality}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the escalation of [[World War II]] in 1942, he was drafted into the Astronomical Department of the Navigation Institute of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].

After the war, in 1948 he joined the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Public Health and Welfare]], where he came under the influence of eminent [[statistician]] [[Matosaburo Masuyama]], who kindled his interest in the [[design of experiments]]. He also worked at the [[Institute of Statistical Mathematics]] during this time,&lt;ref name="asqbio" /&gt; and supported experimental work on the production of [[penicillin]] at [[Morinaga Pharmaceuticals]], a [[Morinaga &amp; Company|Morinaga Seika]] company.

In 1950, he joined the Electrical Communications Laboratory (ECL) of the [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone]] Corporation just as statistical quality control was beginning to become popular in [[Japan]],&lt;ref name="asqbio" /&gt; under the influence of [[W. Edwards Deming]] and the [[Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers]]. ECL was engaged in a rivalry with [[Bell Labs]] to develop cross bar and telephone switching systems, and Taguchi spent his twelve years there in developing methods for enhancing quality and reliability. Even at this point, he was beginning to consult widely in Japanese industry, with [[Toyota]] being an early adopter of his ideas.

During the 1950s, he collaborated widely and in 1954-1955 was visiting professor at the [[Indian Statistical Institute]], where he worked with [[C. R. Rao]],  [[Ronald Fisher]] and [[Walter A. Shewhart]].&lt;ref name="jayaswal"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jayaswal |first=Bijay K. |author2=Peter C. Patton |title=Design for Trustworthy Software: Tools, Techniques, and Methodology of Developing Robust Software |year=2006 |publisher=Prentice Hall |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working at the SQC Unit of ISI, he was introduced to the [[orthogonal array testing|orthogonal arrays]] invented by C. R. Rao - a topic which was to be instrumental in enabling him to develop the foundation blocks of what is now known as Taguchi methods.

On completing his doctorate at [[Kyushu University]] in 1962,&lt;ref name="ieee95"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Taguchi |first=Genichi |title=Quality engineering (Taguchi methods) for the development of electronic circuit technology |journal=IEEE Transactions on Reliability |publisher=IEEE Reliability Society |volume=44 |issue=2 |date=June 1995 |pages=225?229 |issn=0018-9529 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=387375&amp;isnumber=8781 |doi=10.1109/24.387375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies on mathematical statistics for quality control|author=Gen'ichi TAGUCHI|publisher=Kushu University|date=March 1962|series=Doctoral thesis|url=http://iss.ndl.go.jp/books/R100000002-I000007814567-00}}&lt;/ref&gt; he left ECL, though he maintained a consulting relationship. In the same year he visited [[Princeton University]] under the sponsorship of [[John Tukey]], who arranged a spell at [[Bell Labs]], his old ECL rivals. In 1964 he became professor of [[engineering]] at [[Aoyama Gakuin University]], [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="jayaswal" /&gt; In 1966 he began a collaboration with [[Yuin Wu]], who later emigrated to the [[United States|U.S.]] and, in 1980, invited Taguchi to lecture. During his visit there, Taguchi himself financed a return to [[Bell Labs]], where his initial teaching had made little enduring impact. This second visit began a collaboration with [[Madhav Phadke]] and a growing enthusiasm for his methodology in [[Bell Labs]] and elsewhere, including [[Ford Motor Company]], [[Boeing]], [[Xerox]] and [[ITT Corporation|ITT]].

Since 1982, Genichi Taguchi has been an advisor to the [[Japanese Standards Institute]] and executive director of the American Supplier Institute, an international consulting organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About ASI |url=http://www.amsup.com/about.htm |publisher=American Supplier Institute |accessdate=2009-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402001648/http://www.amsup.com/about.htm |archivedate=2009-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His concepts pertaining to experimental design, the loss function, robust design, and the reduction of variation have influenced fields beyond product design and manufacturing, such as [[sales process engineering]].&lt;ref name="Selden 1997"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sales Process Engineering: A Personal Workshop |last=Selden |first=Paul H. |publisher=ASQ Quality Press |location = Milwaukee, WI| year=1997 |pages=156?158, 169, 237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==

{{main|Taguchi methods}}

Taguchi has made a very influential contribution to industrial statistics. Key elements of his quality philosophy include the following:
#[[Taguchi loss function]], used to measure financial loss to society resulting from poor quality;
#The philosophy of ''off-line quality control'', designing products and processes so that they are insensitive ("robust") to parameters outside the design engineer's control.
#Innovations in the statistical [[design of experiments]], notably the use of an outer array for factors that are uncontrollable in real life, but are systematically varied in the experiment.

Gannon played a significant and leading role in the build-up and demise of the [[Irish property bubble]].{{Fact|date=October 2011}} Gannon was at the centre{{Fact|date=October 2011}} of the [[Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy]], which was a contributing element in the development of the [[post-2008 Irish banking crisis]].

==Early and personal life==
Gannon is a native of [[County Roscommon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/gannons-wife-faces-forced-move-of-property-to-nama-2470024.html |title=Gannon's wife faces forced move of property to NAMA |website=Independent.ie |date=2010-12-22 |accessdate=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Married to Margaret, the couple had one son and four daughters. Their daughter Emma died aged 6, whilst their adult son Peter died on 8 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/developers-shock-at-sons-sudden-death-29402456.html |title=Developer's shock at son's sudden death |website=Independent.ie |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gannon started his builder activities in the 1980s in [[London]] while working for his father's construction firm. Gannon and [[Michael Smurfit]] jointly owned the Kildare Hotel and Golf Club, known as the [[K Club]], until Smurfit purchased Gannon's 49% stake for €40 million in 2012 via NAMA.

==Building activity==
In 1986, through the firm Structural Developments Ltd build at Castle Village in Celbridge.{{What|date=October 2011}} In 1988 through another firm – Noteworthy Limited – with partner Michael Anglim, Gannon planned to build 710 houses at Brackenstown close to Swords. At the time it was one of the largest schemes submitted to Dublin County Council. Permission was granted for the scheme in October 1988. The scheme at the time was said to be worth upwards of £40 million. The site on which the houses were built was bought by Noteworthy Ltd as a parcel of land in 1987. The land was zoned for residential purposes in 1983 against the recommendation of the Council’s planning officials. In April 1990, Gannon, now trading through Gannon Homes, sought permission for a £70 m residential scheme and a shopping centre on a 110-acre site on the Malahide road. The scheme involved 915 houses on a 95-acre site fronting the Malahide Road and the Hole in the Wall road at Ayrfield. They also lodged planning applications for a drive-in restaurant, a pub and a library. The firm bought the land from two sites. The 95 acres were bought from Abbey Group and the 15-acre site was the site of the former Clare Manor Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gavin Sheridan |url=http://www.gavinsblog.com/2009/02/25/gerry-gannon/ |title=Gerry Gannon – |website=Gavinsblog.com |date=2009-02-25 |accessdate=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gannon has owned Ericsson R&amp;D facility in [[Athlone]], [[County Westmeath]] for several years. In 2017 it was reported that it would be offered for sale for more than €19m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/commercial-property/19m-ericsson-facility-in-athlone-promises-net-initial-yield-of-10pc-35482489.html|title=€19m Ericsson facility in Athlone promises net initial yield of 10pc – Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2017-03-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Business administration}}An incident is an event that could lead to loss of, or disruption to, an organization's operations, services or functions. '''Incident management''' ('''IcM''') is a term describing the activities of an organization to identify, analyze, and correct hazards to prevent a future re-occurrence. These incidents within a structured organization are normally dealt with by either an [[incident response team]] (IRT), an [[incident management team]] (IMT), or [[Incident Command System]] (ICS). Without effective incident management, an incident can disrupt business operations, information security, IT systems, employees, customers, or other vital business functions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1084688800&amp;r.l1=1073861197&amp;r.l2=1075408323&amp;r.l3=1084688133&amp;r.s=sc&amp;type=RESOURCES|title=What qualifies as an 'incident'? {{!}} Business Link|last=UK|first=Small Business Service, Kingsgate House, 66-74 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6SW,|website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-01-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110615004920/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1084688800&amp;r.l1=1073861197&amp;r.l2=1075408323&amp;r.l3=1084688133&amp;r.s=sc&amp;type=RESOURCES|archivedate=2011-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
An incident is an event that could lead to loss of, or disruption to, an organization's operations, services or functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebci.org/glossary.pdf Glossary of Terms, The Business Continuity Institute Good Practice Guidelines 2010 Global Edition]. thebci.org Retrieved on 2015-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt; Incident management (IcM) is a term describing the activities of an organization to identify, analyze, and correct hazards to prevent a future re-occurrence. If not managed, an incident can escalate into an emergency, crisis or a disaster. Incident management is therefore the process of limiting the potential disruption caused by such an event, followed by a return to business as usual. Without effective incident management, an incident can disrupt business operations, information security, IT systems, employees, customers, or other vital business functions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Physical incident management ===

Incident management is considered to be much more than just the analysis of perceived threats and hazards towards and organization in order to work out the risk of that event occurring, and therefore the ability of that organization to conduct business as usual activities during the incident. An important part of risk management process and business resilience planning that Incident management is a real time physical activity.

The planning that has happened to formulate the response to an incident—be that a disaster, emergency, crisis or accident—has been done so that effective business resilience can take place to ensure minimal loss or damage whether that is to tangible or non tangible assets of that organization. Efficient physical management of the incident—making best use of both time and resources that are available and understanding how to get more resources from outside the organization when needed by clear and timely liaison—ensure the plan is implemented.

[[National Fire Protection Association]] states that incident management can be described as, '[a]n IMS [incident management system] is "the combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures and communications operating within a common organizational structure, designed to aid in the management of resources during incidents".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfpa.org/aboutthecodes/AboutTheCodes.asp?DocNum=1600&amp;cookie_test=1|title=List of NFPA Codes and Standards|date=2013|website=www.nfpa.org|language=en|access-date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ready.gov/business/implementation/incident|title=Incident Management {{!}} Ready.gov|date=2012|website=www.ready.gov|access-date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical incident management is the real time response that may last for hours, days, or longer. The [[Cabinet Office|United Kingdom Cabinet Office]] have produced the National Recovery Guidance (NRG), which is aimed at [[First responder|local responders]] as part of the implementation of the [[Civil Contingencies Act 2004]] (CCA). It describes the response as the following: "Response encompasses the actions taken to deal with the immediate effects of an emergency. In many scenarios, it is likely to be relatively short and to last for a matter of hours or days – rapid implementation of arrangements for collaboration, co-ordination and communication are, therefore, vital. Response encompasses the effort to deal not only with the direct effects of the emergency itself (eg fighting fires, rescuing individuals) but also the indirect effects (eg disruption, media interest)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/national-recovery-guidance|title=National Recovery Guidance - GOV.UK|year=2007|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/36/contents|title=Civil Contingencies Act 2004|year=2012|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which is the world's largest developer of international standards also makes a point in the description of its risk management, principles and guidelines document [[ISO 31000]]:2009 that, "Using ISO 31000 can help organizations increase the likelihood of achieving objectives, improve the identification of opportunities and threats and effectively allocate and use resources for risk treatment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso31000.htm|title=ISO 31000 Risk management|year=2009|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This again shows the importance of not just good planning but effective allocation of resources to treat the risk.

=== Computer security incident management ===
{{Main|Computer security incident management}}
Today, an important role is played by a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), due to the rise of internet crime, and is a common example of incident faced by companies in developed nations all across the world. For example, if an organization discovers that an intruder has gained unauthorized access to a computer system, the CSIRT would analyze the situation, determine the breadth of the compromise, and take corrective action. [[Computer forensics]] is one task included in this process. Currently, over half of the world’s hacking attempts on Trans National Corporations (TNCs) take place in North America (57%). 23% of attempts take place in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.technet.com/b/rhalbheer/archive/2010/03/12/hacking-incidents-2009-interesting-data.aspx Hacking Incidents 2009 – Interesting Data – Roger's Security Blog – Site Home – TechNet Blogs]. Blogs.technet.com (2010-03-12). Retrieved on 2012-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Having a well-rounded Computer Security Incident Response team is integral to providing a secure environment for any organization, and is becoming a critical part of the overall design of many modern networking teams.

== Roles ==
Incidents within a structured organization are normally dealt with by either an [[incident response team]] (IRT), or an [[incident management team]] (IMT). These are often designated beforehand or during the event, and are placed in control of the organization whilst the incident is dealt with, to restore normal functions.

The [[Incident Command System]] (ICS) is designed to deal with a larger incident involving a respond from multiple agencies. Popular with [[public safety]] agencies and jurisdictions in the United States, Canada and other countries, it is growing in practice in the private sector as organizations begin to manage without or co-manage emergencies with public safety agencies. ICS is a command and control mechanism that provides an expandable structure to manage emergency agencies.  Although some of the details vary by jurisdiction, ICS normally consists of five primary elements: command, operations, planning, logistics and finance/administration.  Several special staff positions, including public affairs, safety, and liaison, report directly to the incident commander (IC) when the emergency warrants establishment of those positions.

Another response system is the [[Gold–silver–bronze command structure]], which is used by emergency services in the United Kingdom and other countries. The system has three levels of command: a gold commander sets the overall strategy, a silver commander is in direct charge of those at the scene and bronze commanders direct responders on the ground. An individual agency may use the system, or multiple agencies may use the system as they liaise. A common feature of the ICS and Gold-Silver-Bronze systems is that they create a separate command system to the agencies' usual hierarchy.

Usually as part of the wider management process in private organizations, incident management is followed by post-incident analysis where it is determined why the incident happened despite precautions and controls. This analysis is normally overseen by the leaders of the organization, with the view of preventing repetition of the incident through precautionary measures and often changes in policy. This information is then used as feedback to further develop the security policy and/or its practical implementation. In the United States, the [[National Incident Management System]], developed by the [[Department of Homeland Security]], integrates effective practices in emergency management into a comprehensive national framework. This often results in a higher level of contingency planning, exercise and training, as well as an evaluation of the management of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/gc_1230910518359.shtm About the Contingency Planning and Incident Management Division | Homeland Security] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402131642/https://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/gc_1230910518359.shtm |date=April 2, 2012 }}. Dhs.gov (1999-02-22). Retrieved on 2012-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incident management software systems ==
Incident management software systems are designed for collecting consistent, time sensitive, documented [[incident report]] data. Many of these products include features to automate the approval process of an incident report or case investigation. These products may also have the ability to collect real time incident information such as time and date data. Additionally incident report systems will automatically send notifications, assign tasks and escalations to appropriate individuals depending on the incident type, priority, time, status and custom criteria. Modern products provide the ability for administrators to configure the Incident report forms as needed, create analysis reports and set access controls on the data.  These incident reports may have the ability for customization that may best suit the organizations using the systems. Some of these products have the ability to collect images, video, audio and other data. Incident management software systems exist that relate directly to specific industries.

== Root cause analysis ==
{{Main|root cause analysis}}

=== Human factors ===
{{One source|section
| date = January 2018
}}

During the [[root cause analysis]], human factors should be assessed. James Reason conducted a study into the understanding of adverse effects of human factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reason J | title = Understanding adverse events: human factors | journal = Quality in Health Care | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 80–9 | date = June 1995 | pmid = 10151618 | pmc = 1055294 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that major incident investigations, such as [[Piper Alpha]] and [[Kings Cross Underground fire|Kings Cross Underground Fire]], made it clear that the causes of the accidents were distributed widely within and outside the organization. There are two types of events: active failure—an action that has immediate effects and has the likelihood to cause an accident—and latent or delayed action—events can take years to have an effect and are usually combined with triggering events that then cause the accident.

Active failures are unsafe acts (errors and violations) committed by, for instance, the operators of machinery and supervisors of tasks. It is the people at the human-system interface whose actions can have immediate adverse consequences.

Latent failures are created as the result of decisions taken at the higher echelons of an organisation. Their damaging consequences may lie dormant for a long time, only becoming evident when they combine with local triggering factors (e.g., the [[spring tide]], the loading difficulties at [[Zeebrugge]] harbour, etc.) to breach the system's defences. Decisions taken in the higher echelons of an organization can trigger the events towards an accident becoming more likely, the planning, scheduling, forecasting, designing, policy making, etc., can have a slow burning effect. The actual unsafe act that triggers an accident can be traced back through the organization and the subsequent failures can be exposed, showing the accumulation of latent failures within the system as a whole that led to the accident becoming more likely and ultimately happening. Better improvement action can be applied, and reduce the likelihood of the event happening again.&lt;ref&gt;O’Callaghan, Katherine Mary, [http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp272.01032011/index.html Incident Management:  Human Factors and Minimising Mean Time to Restore] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917053506/http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp272.01032011/index.html |date=2011-09-17 }}, Ph.D. Thesis, Australian Catholic University, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''International Labor Rights Forum v Firestone Tire and Rubber Co''' (2005) was a class-action lawsuit filed by The [[International Labor Rights Forum]] on November 17, 2005, against the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]], on behalf of a group of former child laborers, in [[Liberia]].

The plaintiffs accused the company of knowingly allowing the use of child laborers filing a suit as a result of policies which began when Firestone opened its first plant in Liberia in 1926.

Firestone contends the 1926 agreement as a milestone advancement in the global production of rubber.

[[File:Actiune Muschong 25000 Lei.jpg|thumb|right|250px|25,000 share of the ''Dampfziegelwerke AG'' (''Stream Brick Factory'') in [[Lugos]] (1923)]]
At the age of 20 years he married Margaret Bohn the daughter of a famous [[Germany|German]] industrialist specialized in the production of tiles and bricks that built the brick factory at [[Zsombolya]] (now Jimbolia, Romania) and [[Gyertyámos]] (Cărpiniş) and had other several factories in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="jacob"/&gt;

At the age of 20, Muschong and his wife founded the ''M. Bohn &amp; Comp.'' which in 1888 built a brick factory in [[Lugoj]]. After several years  he built a new plant in Lugoj and bought several factories from his competitors. In 1908 the company changed its name to ''J. Muschong &amp; Comp.''&lt;ref name="jacob"/&gt; Muschong brick and tile products were of high quality and were sold throughout the [[Austria–Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and then in [[Greater Romania]]. Muschong built more factories in [[Banat]] but he also built one at the outskirts of [[Budapest]]. In 1910 his company had 357 employees which made it the 23rd biggest employer in the [[Banat]] and the biggest in Lugoj.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vikek.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/KEKNo292015.2.szám.pdf Közép-Európai Közlemények - A történelemtudomány, a regionális tudomány, a földrajztudomány, és a gazdálkodás- és szervezéstudományok művelőinek folyóirata - VIII. year 2.

===Bad Busiasch===
He was also the founder of the [[Buziaş|Buziaş Spa]] (''{{lang-de|Bad Busiasch}}'', ''{{lang-hu|Buziásfürdő}}'').&lt;ref name="jacob"/&gt; He bought the bath and the 100 ha forest around it in 1906 from the family of the Hungarian tire manufacturer, Ernő Schottola. He built a bottling hall to produce bottled mineral water under the names ''Phönix''&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.nyugatijelen.com/2003/2003%20februar/feb.%2022-23%20szombat-vasarnap/jelen.html Nyugati Jelen - Sipos - Újabb tulajdonosváltás előtt Buziásfürdő?]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Muschong''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.europeana.eu/portal/de/record/2032009/Hungarian_20National_20Museum_data_hnm_hu_object_1453957.html Europeana Collections - Buziási "Phönix" forrás savanyúvize | Muschong Jakab; Grafikai Intézet Rt.]&lt;/ref&gt; He also built a carbon acid factory in 1907 for 2 million [[Austro-Hungarian krone|krones]]. The main export market for the mineral waters was the [[Balkan]] region. The plant had 700 m^2 area where the 700 [[horsepower|HP]] steam engine and 60 HP electric engines provided the driving force. The plant had 36 employees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/magyarorszgvrmeg18szik/magyarorszgvrmeg18szik_djvu.txt Samu Borovszky - Magyarország vármegyéi és városai - MAGYARORSZÁG MONOGRÁFIÁJA - Temes vármegye]&lt;/ref&gt;

He carried out probing drills, which were successful: the water came from 103 meters deep and it became medically proven that the water was good for [[gout]] or [[gastric lavage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infotourism.info/hu/news/Temes-megye-----Buziasfurdo infotourism.info - Temes megye – Buziásfürdő]&lt;/ref&gt; He also laid the beautiful spa gardens with valuable plants, built a 500-meter-long covered walkway, 22 villas for spa guests, a zoo and sports fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adz.ro/banater-zeitung/artikel-banater-zeitung/artikel/gruenes-licht-fuer-sanierung-des-kurparks/ Balthasar Waitz - Grünes Licht für die Sanierung des Kurparks - February 8, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; He also raised a hotel in 1922-1923 which he named ''Muschong Hotel'' (now ''Felix Hotel'') after himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hetiujszo.ro/graur-janos-buziasfurdo-legenda-es-valosag-az-emlekek-tukreben-6-befejezo-resz/ Heti Újszó - Graur János – Buziásfürdő Legenda és valóság az emlékek tükrében]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he built a 2.9&amp;nbsp;km long railway with a normal gauge (1435&amp;nbsp;mm) between [[Buziaş]] railway station and the spa. According to the 1958 timetable, the journey took 7 minutes between the two stations. (On October 10, 1973 the railway line was dismantled.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vasutallomasok.hu/allomas.php?az=buzb - Buziásfürdő]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1948 the spa, the hotels and the bottling plant stayed in the Muschong family's ownership. Then it was nationalized.&lt;ref&gt;[https://geografie.uvt.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/15_Ribana.pdf Ribana Linc, Angela Ioana MARUŞCA - Spas at the west of the country]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Budapest===
According to the ''Cégfelszámoló'' (''Company Directory'') he was named as liquidator of the ''Egyesült magyar kénsavgyárak értékesítő szövetkezete'' (''United Sulfuric Acid Manufacturers Cooperative'', est. 1909, 11 Ipar utca, [[Ferencváros|District IX]], [[Budapest]]), shareholder of ''Kőbányai Gőztéglagyár'' (''Steam Brick Factory of Kőbánya'', est. 1876, 1 Erzsébet-körút, [[Erzsébetváros|District VII]], [[Budapest]]) and shareholder of the ''Közönséges tömörfaltéglákat árusító részvénytársaság'' (''Ordinary Solid Wallbrick Selling plc'', est. 1900, 27 [[Andrássy út]], [[Terézváros|District VI]]).&lt;ref name="library.hungaricana.hu"&gt;[https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/FszekCimNevTarak_26_028/?pg=307&amp;layout=s&amp;query=muschong Cégmutató Budapest bejegyzett működő cégeiről 1921.

[[File:Hotel Timis Lugoj.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''Muschong Palace'' (today ''Timiș Hotel'') in [[Lugoj]]]]

One of the most emblematic buildings of Lugoj is the ''Timiș Hotel'' which was built in 1926 as the ''Muschong Palace'' and was owned by Jakob Muschong.

===Later years===
In 1913 he worked as the CEO of ''Ziegel- und Kalkbrennerei AG'' in [[Budapest]] while his son, ''Jakab Muschong Jr'' was the manager of [[Bad Busiasch]], co-leader of the ''Ziegel- und Kalkbrennerei AG'' and ''Hatzfelder Dampfziegelei AG'', [[Zsombolya]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://portal.zedhia.at/page/public/cpa_000273-1850/compass-1913-i-band Compass 1913, I. Band - Seite 1850]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Great Union]] of 1918 the Romanian authorities began the persecution of Jacob Muschong, considering that he opposes Romanian capital development.&lt;ref name="jacob"/&gt; He is teased and persecuted by a broad campaign of denigration by the media. Many financial controls from the authorities followed which discovered accounting irregularities alleged in the statements of income, considering the amounts invested by Muschong as profit and forcing him to pay tax on them.

===Death===
Soon after, Muschong died in a heart attack on December 13, 1923 at his residence in Lugoj.&lt;ref name="jacob"/&gt;

After his death no one in the family could raise to the level of driving experience and ability that Jacob had. His wealth re-evaluated in today's money would probably amounts to over three billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-presa_regionala_arhiva-1722574-imperiul-muschong-naste-mostenitori.htm|title=Imperiul Muschong naste mostenitori|date=2006-04-15|publisher=hotnews.ro|language=Romanian|accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; All his factories were nationalized by the communists in 1948 and largely demolished. Instead of his largest brick factory located on Timişorii street in [[Lugoj]] the communists built the Tiles and Sanitary Equipment Factory ''Mondial'' which was later privatized in 1996 to German investors and still exists today.&lt;ref&gt;[https://emt.ro/sites/default/files/archivum/program/Esemény%20archívum%20beküldése/emt_bkf_program_2007.pdf Dr Árpád Jancsó - Bányászati-kohászati kirándulásvezet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He was married to Margaret Bohn and had two daughters, Margit and Borbála and a son, Jakab. According to the ''Cégfelszámoló'' (''Company Directory'') his son, Jakab Muschong Jr. had a grenade patron company in 6203 Külső Bécsi út, [[Budapest]], [[Óbuda-Békásmegyer|Disctrict III]].&lt;ref name="library.hungaricana.hu"/&gt;

'''''Liar's Poker''''' is a non-fiction, semi-[[autobiographical]] book by [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]] describing the author's experiences as a [[Bond (finance)|bond]] salesman on [[Wall Street]] during the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Michael, Liar's Poker, W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1989. {{ISBN|0-393-02750-3}}. {{cite web |url=http://www.wwnorton.com/catalog/backlist/002750.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501034946/http://www.wwnorton.com/catalog/backlist/002750.htm |archivedate=2009-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; First published in 1989, it is considered one of the books that defined Wall Street during the 1980s, along with [[Bryan Burrough]] and John Helyar's ''[[Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco]]'', and the fictional ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' by [[Tom Wolfe]]. The book captures an important period in the history of Wall Street. Two important figures in that history feature prominently in the text, the head of [[Salomon Brothers]]' mortgage department [[Lewis Ranieri]] and the firm's CEO [[John Gutfreund]].

The book's name is taken from [[liar's poker]], a high-stakes gambling game popular with the bond traders in the book.

==Overview==
''Liar's Poker'' follows two different story threads, though not necessarily in chronological order.

The first thread is autobiographical, and follows Lewis through his college education and his hiring by [[Salomon Brothers]] (now a subsidiary of [[Citigroup]]) in 1984. This part of the book gives a first-person account of how bond [[Trader (finance)|traders]] and salesmen truly work, their personalities, and their [[culture]].  The book captures well an important period in the history of Wall Street.  Important figures in that history feature prominently in the text: [[John Meriwether]], mortgage department head [[Lewis Ranieri]], and firm CEO [[John Gutfreund]].

The second thread is a history of Salomon Brothers and an overview of Wall Street in general, especially how the firm single-handedly created a market for [[mortgage bond]]s that made the firm wealthy, only to be outdone by [[Michael Milken]] and his [[junk bonds]]. This thread is less dependent on Lewis' personal experience and features quotes apparently drawn from interviews with various relevant figures.

Lewis jumps back and forth between these two threads in the book.

==Biographical section==
Lewis was an [[art history]] student at [[Princeton University]], who nonetheless wanted to break into [[Wall Street]] to make money. He describes his almost pathetic attempts to find a [[finance]] job, only to be roundly rejected by every firm to which he applied. For example, in 1982 [[Lehman Brothers]] had rejected his employment application. He then enrolled in the [[London School of Economics]] to gain a master's degree in economics.

While in England, Lewis was invited to a banquet hosted by the [[Queen Mother]], where his cousin, Baroness Linda Monroe von Stauffenberg, one of the organizers of the banquet, purposefully seated him next to the wife of the London managing partner of [[Salomon Brothers]]. She hoped that his intelligence might impress her enough for her to suggest to her husband that Lewis, be given a job with Salomon Brothers. The strategy worked, and Lewis was granted an interview and subsequently received a job offer.

Lewis then moved to [[New York City]] for Salomon's training program. Here, he was appalled at the sophomoric, obtuse and obnoxious behavior of some of his fellow trainees, and indoctrinated into the money culture of Salomon Brothers and the Wall Street culture as a whole.

From New York, Lewis was shipped to the [[London]] office of Salomon Brothers as a bond salesman. Despite his lack of knowledge, he was soon handling millions of dollars in [[investment]] accounts. In 1987, he witnessed a near-hostile [[takeover]] of Salomon Brothers but survived with his job. However, growing disillusioned with his work, Lewis quit the firm at the beginning of 1988 to write this book and become a financial [[journalist]].  The first edition was published October 17, 1989.

==Wall Street culture==
The book is an unflattering portrayal of Wall Street traders and salesmen, their personalities, their beliefs, and their work practices.

During the training sessions, Lewis was struck by the infantilism of most of his fellow trainees. Examples included yelling at and insulting financial experts who talked to them, throwing spit balls at one another and at lecturers, calling [[phone sex]] lines and then broadcasting them over the company's [[intercom]], [[gambling]] on behavioral traits (such as how long it took certain trainees to fall asleep during lectures), and the trainees' incredible lust for money and contempt for any position that did not earn that much.

Lewis attributed the bond traders' and salesmen's behavior to the fact that the trading floor required neither finesse nor advanced financial knowledge, but, rather, the ability and desire to exploit others' weaknesses, to intimidate others into listening to traders and salesmen, and the ability to spend hours a day screaming orders under high pressure situations. He referred to their worldview as "The Law of the Jungle."

He also noted that, although most arrivals on Wall Street had studied [[economics]], this knowledge was never used; in fact, any academic knowledge was frowned on by traders.

Lewis also attributed the [[savings and loan scandal]] of the 1980s and 1990s to the inability of inexperienced, provincial, small-town bank managers to compete with Wall Street. He described people on Wall Street as masters at taking advantage of an undiscerning public, which the savings and loan industry provided in abundance.

==Overall economic climate of the 1980s==
Lewis portrays the 1980s as an era where government [[deregulation]] allowed less-than-scrupulous people on Wall Street to take advantage of others' ignorance, and thus grow extremely wealthy.

He traces the rise of Salomon Brothers through mortgage trading, when deregulation by the [[U.S. Congress]] suddenly allowed managers of [[savings and loan association]]s to start selling mortgages as bonds. [[Lewis Ranieri]], a Salomon Brothers' employee, had created the only viable mortgage trading section on Wall Street, so when the law passed, it became a windfall for the firm.

However, Lewis believed that Salomon Brothers became too complacent in their new-found wealth and took to unwise expansion and massive displays of [[conspicuous consumption]]. When the rest of Wall Street wised up to the market, the firm lost its advantage.

Another problem Lewis noticed was a large disconnect between what Salomon Brothers mortgage traders were paid, and what they ''believed'' they should have been paid. Ranieri and his fellow traders felt that, since their department generated so much money for the firm, they ought to receive considerably higher salaries and compensation. Gutfreund and other managers, on the other hand, argued that the traders were not risking their own money, but the firm's, and noted that the mortgage department spent years losing money before succeeding. Because of this disagreement, Salomon Brothers lost many of its traders when other firms that added mortgage bonds to their business began to offer higher salaries, easily luring the Salomon Brothers mortgage bond traders away.

Likewise, Lewis argued that Salomon Brothers tried to "professionalize" itself. As he notes, Ranieri and his fellow traders lacked college degrees; one of the traders had not even finished the eighth grade. Despite their lack of academic credentials, the group was extremely successful financially. But in order to improve its "image," the firm began to hire graduates of prestigious business and economics programs. Because of his uncouth manners, Ranieri (along with many of his [[Italian American]] colleagues) were eventually fired.

Lewis argued that Salomon Brothers' mortgage-bond success was based not on innate intelligence or trading skill, but on pure luck. Lewis noted that, although Ranieri was often hailed as a "visionary" for creating a mortgage department before a mortgage market existed, deregulation caught him completely by surprise. The firms that lured away Salomon's traders with higher salaries ended up losing money, as it soon became clear that the traders lacked any special skills: they just happened to be working in mortgages during a period of rising bond prices. After enough firms became involved with mortgage bonds, prices stabilized, and the bonds eventually traded like any others.

After dealing with mortgage bonds, Lewis examined junk bonds and described how [[Michael Milken]] built junk bonds from nothing to a multi-trillion-dollar market. Because the demand for junk bonds was higher than its supply, Lewis argues that [[corporate raid]]ers began to attack otherwise sound companies in order to create more junk bonds.

Lewis remarked in his conclusion that the 1980s were a time when anyone could make millions, provided they were in the right place at the right time, as exemplified by Lewis Ranieri's success.

==Catch phrases==
*'''Big Swinging Dick''' — A big-time trader or salesman. ("If he could make millions of dollars come out of those phones, he became that most revered of all species: a Big Swinging Dick." p.&amp;nbsp;56.) The opposite of this term is '''Geek''', used to refer to a just-hired trainee.
*'''Equities in Dallas''' — A particularly undesirable job within a finance firm. ("Thus, '''Equities in Dallas''' became training program shorthand for 'Just bury that lowest form of human scum where it will never be seen again'" p.&amp;nbsp;58.)
*'''Blowing up a customer''' — Successfully convincing a customer to purchase an investment product which ends up declining rapidly in value, forcing the client to end up withdrawing from the market.
*'''Feeding Frenzy''' — The Friday-morning meal shared by a certain clique of bond traders. At this meal, traders would order astounding quantities of take-out food, far more than they could eat (e.g., a five-gallon tubs of [[guacamole]] with an order of $400 worth of [[Mexican food]]). The traders would then compete with each other to see who could display the most [[gluttony]].
*'''The Human Piranha''' — Nickname for an employee &lt;ref&gt;"The Human Piranha" is said to be [http://books.wwnorton.com/books/Author.aspx?id=8413 Tom Bernard] [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/11/AR2009091102602.html] who ran trading businesses for [[Salomon Brothers]], [[Kidder Peabody]], and [[Lehman Brothers]] for twenty-eight years on Wall Street.&lt;/ref&gt; at Salomon Brothers who constantly used the word "[[fuck]]" and its variants in his speech. A reference to [[Tom Wolfe]]'s character in ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]''.
*'''No Tears''' — Used to describe a preset alternate rule Michael Lewis describes in the book, John Gutfreund challenges John Meriweather to a game of Liars Poker, in which he states "no tears" which means players of the game who lose can't complain about losing afterwards.

Derby discontinued the Nishiki brand in the United States in 2001.&lt;br/&gt;

'''Looptworks''' is a Portland, Oregon business that [[upcycle]]s or re-purposes abandoned, [[pre-consumer]] and post-consumer materials into limited-edition products.&lt;ref name="tp-waste" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fc-upcycles" /&gt; By re-using the world’s pre-consumer excess, the U.S.-based company aims to "break the cycle of waste".&lt;ref name="lw site-about" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gl-cycle" /&gt; The products created by Looptworks primarily focus on bags, accessories and clothing.&lt;ref name="fc-upcycles" /&gt;

It is estimated that a single garment factory can create up to 60,000 pounds (27 metric tons) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120513174301/http://www.looptworks.com/blog/2011/09/entrepreneur-magazine-the-innovators/ Entrepreneur Magazine video] of textile waste, which normally goes to landfills.&lt;ref name="wm-wearable waste" /&gt; Looptworks intends to use that waste to make new garments.&lt;ref name="wm-wearable waste" /&gt;
"Our intent is to follow the waste stream. We as western society have gone over [to Asia] and asked a lot of people to do favors for us but haven’t considered what the implications are. We have to clean up our mess", according to Scott Hamlin, Looptworks's Co-Founder.&lt;ref name="wm-wearable waste" /&gt; Looptworks intends to call attention to excess and waste, and encourage "thoughtful consumption."&lt;ref name="wm-wearable waste" /&gt;
  
Looptworks's designs will change frequently, as sources of supply vary, making each design effectively a "limited edition".&lt;ref name="tp-waste" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fc-upcycles" /&gt; This will add to the attraction for some consumers.&lt;ref name="tp-waste" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wm-wearable waste" /&gt;

Looptworks will have a much quicker design cycle than most apparel makers with an estimated 9 weeks as opposed to 54.&lt;ref name="wm-wearable waste" /&gt;

Looptworks has introduced "laptop sleeves" constructed from a wetsuit factory's scrap neoprene.&lt;ref name="th-sleeves" /&gt;

According to Ariel Schwartz of ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'': "Looptworks isn't the first company to manufacture upcycled goods-but it is the first clothing line to exclusively use textile waste that would otherwise end up in the garbage."&lt;ref name="fc-upcycles" /&gt;

==Sponsorships==
Looptworks is the official supplier and sponsor of numerous [[association football]] teams, players and associations, including:

== Biography and Career ==
He grew up in various orphanages, the longest in a house run by nuns in [[Szamotuły]]. He graduated from a 2-year vocational school in plumbing.

In the 80s he traded at the [[Poznań]] trade fair, at the end of the 1980s he specialized in coffee making and then in computer hardware distribution.

In 1987, he founded [[Elektromis]], an enterprise importing [[confectionery]], radio and television equipment, beer and spirits. Within 2 years, it transformed into a huge holding. Some of his companies back then were registered and ran by his friends from the orphanages. In 1992, [[Elektromis]] owned 50 warehouses throughout [[Poland]] and PLN 168 million of profit per year.

In 1993, he transformed Elektromis into [[Eurocash]], which became the largest grocery wholesale chain in [[Poland]]. In 1995 he sold it to [[Jerónimo Martins]]. In 1995, he founded the discount chain [[Biedronka]], which he sold (243 branches) in 1998 also to [[Jerónimo Martins]].

He was the owner of the weekly ''Miliarder''. He helped [[Jerzy Urban]] in setting up the weekly "''Nie''". He founded the Posnania bank, which, however, in 1995 closed down.

In 1998, he founded [[Żabka (convenience store)|Żabka]], whose shares in 2000 were bought by the AIG fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/12/Artykul/307770,EBRD-to-invest-in-Polandbased-grocery-retailer-Zabka|title=EBRD to invest in Poland-based grocery retailer Żabka|work=Polskie Radio dla Zagranicy|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, he launched the "Sowiniec FIZ" fund investing in real estate. It owns land between [[Puszczykowo]] near [[Poznań]] and [[Sowiniec, West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Sowiniec]]. At the end of the 1990s, he also bought plots in Poznań, in the [[Stare Miasto, Poznań|Naramowice]] housing estate.

In December 2010, the Poznań-based company [[Świtalski &amp; Synowie]] changed its name to Czerwona Torebka SA. In 2013, he created the discount chain store Czerwony Torebka. In April 2015, the management of the company Dyskont Czerwona Torebka SA decided to liquidate the company. In July of the same year, all stores were closed, and the company Czerwona Naporeka ceased to exist.

As of 2015, he was the 40th richest person in Poland as named by [[Wprost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rankingi.wprost.pl/100-najbogatszych-polakow/2015|title=100 Najbogatszych Polaków 2015|website=Rankingi Wprost|language=pl|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12252">'''Market information systems''' (otherwise known as '''market intelligence systems''', '''market information services''', or '''MIS''', and not to be confused with [[management information systems]]) are information systems used in gathering, analyzing and disseminating information about prices and other information relevant to farmers, animal rearers, traders, processors and others involved in handling agricultural products. Market information systems play an important role in agro-industrialisation and food [[supply chain]]s. With the advance of [[Information and communication technologies for development]] (ICTs) in developing countries, the income- generation opportunities offered by market information systems have been sought by international development organizations, [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) and businesses alike.

==Types of market information systems==
There is a wide variety of market information systems or services. [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries have traditionally emphasised the importance of information provision for the agricultural sector, a notable example being the service provided by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA). Such systems are widely used in order to increase the transparency and the volume of information flowing through the supply chains for different agricultural products. The ability of market information systems to provide a valuable service was strengthened with the development of the Internet and the advance of electronic commerce ([[business-to-business]] (B2B), [[consumer-to-consumer]], etc.). Industry structure, product complexity and the demanding nature of agricultural transactions are considered determining factors for the development of B2B [[electronic commerce]] in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Leroux, Wortman Jr, and Mathias [http://www.ifama.org/tamu/iama/members/articles/v4i2/205-218.pdf Dominant Factors Impacting the Development of Business-to-Business (B2B)] e-Commerce in Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agricultural market information in developing countries==
In developing countries, market information initiatives are often part of broader interventions and part of the [[Agricultural Marketing|agricultural marketing]] and [[agribusiness]] development strategy that many governments are actively engaged in. It is commonly understood that long transaction chains, lack of transparency, lack of standards, and insufficient access to markets for products has perpetuated low incomes in predominantly agrarian economies. Early attempts at market information provision in developing countries involved government bodies in collecting price information, and arranging for this to be disseminated via newspapers and radio stations. The information provided was often not very accurate and usually reached farmers too late to be of practical use. Governments often attempted to cover far too many locations and many services either collapsed after initial donor assistance came to an end or managed to struggle along with little impact.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew W. Shepherd, [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/003/x6993e/x6993e01.pdf Market Information Services: Theory and Practice], FAO, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building Agricultural Market Information Systems: A literature review|last=FAO|first=|publisher=FAO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-5-109738-0|location=Rome|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Furthermore, it was soon recognised that it was not enough just to supply market information to farmers. They needed assistance in understanding how to use that information.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew W. Shepherd,  [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/012/x8826e/x8826e00.pdf Understanding and Using Market Information.] FAO, Rome, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; However, donor organizations, such as [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], [[Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU (CTA)|CTA]], [[International Institute for Communication and Development|IICD]], [[USAID]], [[DFID]], and the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], remain committed to improving the efficiencies within the supply chain through greater information provision. The recent surge of [[mobile phone]] usage in developing countries has provided an opportunity for innovative projects to leverage this new distribution channel to get critical market data into the hands of farmers and traders, taking advantage of the [[Short Message Service|SMS]] capacity of phones. Using the so-called "push" method recipients of information are identified on a database and automatically receive messages of relevance to them. Alternatively, the "pull" method enables farmers and traders to interrogate the database of the MIS. A farmer can send an SMS with the product and location he is interested in (e.g. tomatoes;Nairobi) and receive an immediate reply. Several projects by [[Reuters]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reutersmarketlight.com/ Reuters Market Light, India]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nokia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nokia.com/NOKIA_COM_1/Microsites/Entry_Event/Materials/Nokia_Life_Tools_datasheet.pdf Nokia's Life Tools]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Esoko]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esoko.com Esoko]&lt;/ref&gt; KACE,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kace-kenya.com KACE Kenya]&lt;/ref&gt; Manobi,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manobi.sn Manobi]&lt;/ref&gt; AgRisk&lt;ref&gt;[http://agrisk.in Agrisk]&lt;/ref&gt; and others have demonstrated the impact that such information can have. Amongst donors there is a renewed interest in promoting regional trade, particularly in Africa, and market information is seen as an important way of achieving this. Examples of donor-supported services are  [http://www.ratin.net/ RATIN] for East Africa and  [http://www.resimao.net RESIMAO] for West Africa.

Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether MIS can be delivered on a profitable basis by the private sector, given the difficulty of fully covering costs, or on a sustainable basis by the public sector, given the latter's history of gathering inaccurate data and disseminating it badly.&lt;ref&gt;ICT in Agriculture, Module 9, [http://www.ictinagriculture.org/sourcebook/module-9-strengthening-agricultural-marketing] World Bank, Washington D.C. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shepherd|first1=Andrew|title=Assessing the quality of agricultural market information systems: A self-assessment guide|date=2018|publisher=FAO|location=Rome|isbn=978-92-5-130460-0|url=http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/I8935EN|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To try to address some of these problems, a new approach makes the buyers responsible for uploading the price information via SMS, and facilitates trade by creating a capacity for sellers to contact individual buyers.

'''Millennium High School''' is a selective public high school for grades 9 through 12 in [[Manhattan]]. It is operated by the [[New York City Department of Education]] in Region 9 and is ranked 77th within New York State and 688th nationwide by the [[U.S. News]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/new-york/districts/new-york-city-public-schools/millennium-high-school-13103&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] is the school's mascot, meant to symbolize the school rising from the ashes of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] following the September 11 attacks. In 2016, the school received more than 6,000 applications for 170 seats, yielding an acceptance rate of less than 3%. Admission to MHS is based on selective criteria including a middle school GPA of 90 or above, attendance, State test scores in reading and math, and an optional essay.

== Demographics ==
The student body is 64% female, 36% male, 41% Asian, 31% Caucasian, 15% Latino, 7% African American, .2% Native American Indian or Alaskan Native and 5% multi-racial or other. Approximately 44% are eligible for free or reduced lunch and many students are also first-generation students. 

== History ==
Millennium High School was founded in 2002 with a $500,000 grant from New Visions for Public Schools with money donated from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], the [[Carnegie Corporation]], and the [[Open Society Institute]]. Community Board 1 raised $14 million to build the school. The space within the building was made possible with several million dollars worth of [[Grant (money)|grants]] from the [[United States government|federal government]] in 2003, as well as contributions from concerned groups such as New Visions for Public Schools, in an attempt to revitalize the lower [[Manhattan]] area following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

== Campus ==
The school occupies the 11th, 12th, and 13th floors of the former ITT building, in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] at [[Lower Manhattan|its southern tip]].&lt;ref&gt;http://insideschools.org/high/browse/school/69&lt;/ref&gt; The interior is modern, colorful, open, and well-lit. The design uses large rooms and gathering spaces more often than corridors and sealed doors, because of its location in an office building.

== Academics and Extracurriculars  ==
All MHS students take four years of English, Social Studies, Mathematics, and Science, as well as three years of Foreign Language -- either Spanish or Mandarin. There are two to three hours of homework each night and 20 hours of annual community service to fulfill. Millennium offers a rigorous schedule, though as a small school, the [[Advanced Placement]] courses are few: [[AP English]] (language and literature), [[AP United States History]], [[AP Studio Art]], [[AP World History]], [[AP Biology]], [[AP Chemistry]], and [[AP Calculus]]. Other advanced courses are offered in physics. Recently, it became a [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] school after incorporating Engineering into the curriculum. The school has a partnership with the [[YMCA of Greater New York]], and provides numerous extracurricular offerings, sports organizations, and other activities for the students. Ninth and tenth-grade students take core classes in English, Math, Science, and History. Eleventh and twelfth-grade students have the chance to take AP course and specific courses in different subjects. In addition to this, junior and senior year students have the opportunity to take [[College Now]] classes as well as college classes at [[Pace University]].

MHS students can participate in after-school clubs and PSAL sports. These include Student Government &amp; Ethics, Senior Officers, Art Club, Chess Club, Drama Club, Environmental Club, Equestrian Club, Film Club, Fitness Club, Foreign Exchange, Gay Straight Alliance, Math Team, Myriad - Literary Arts Magazine, MHS Newspaper, Peer Mediation, Phoenix Dance Club, School of Rock, Shakespeare Monologues, Basketball, Baseball, Cross Country, Fencing, Soccer, Softball, Swimming, Table Tennis, Volleyball, Yoga. A number of students at MHS take advantage of the opportunity to initiate and lead extracurricular activities.

== Faculty ==
Former principal Robert Rhodes has long been a public school teacher and administrator. He received [[Clark University]]'s Secondary Educator of the Year award in 2003. He announced on February 16, 2012 that he would step down from his position after June 2012 to become principal at [[Horace Greeley High School]] in Chappaqua, NY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brian|first=Marschhauser|title=Chappaqua Superintendent Chooses Next Horace Greeley Principa|url=http://www.thedailychappaqua.com/schools/chappaqua-superintendent-chooses-greeley-principal|work=the daily chappaqua|accessdate=16 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130204011852/http://www.thedailychappaqua.com/schools/chappaqua-superintendent-chooses-greeley-principal|archivedate=4 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The staff of Millennium High School all have master's degrees and have attended colleges and universities including: NYU, Dartmouth, [[University of Connecticut]], Stanford, Barnard, [[University of Rochester]], Bucknell, Columbia, Michigan, Haverford, MIT, Indiana, Connecticut College, The Ohio State University, Cornell, Rutgers, Wellesley, Skidmore, Wisconsin, UMass, Tufts, and Duke. Many have been recipients of highly competitive grants and have studied around the world. Current Principal Colin McEvoy is a founding faculty member at Millennium High School. Formerly a Peace Corps volunteer in Estonia, where he taught English as a second language, he received a master's degree at Columbia University Teachers College. Assistant Principal Latika Keegan is also a graduate of Columbia University Teachers College, where she received a master's degree in Computing in Education. She also holds master's degrees in English Literature, and Educational Leadership. The faculty members of MHS all have master's degrees in their respective fields, and many have been recipients of highly competitive grants. Some of the school's faculty participate in professional development programs such as the Pace Inquiry Learning Collaborative, while others are recipients of fellowships from Math for America and Fund for Teachers.

==Awards and recognition== 
MHS is a recipient of the 2006 Rising Star High School Award, one of Manhattan Media’s Blackboard Awards and is regularly featured in NYC Best Public High Schools. MHS was ranked #8 by the [[New York Post]] in their ''Top 40 Public High Schools in NYC'' online article. [[Niche (company)|Niche]] ranked it #43 in their ''2017 Most Diverse Public High Schools in NY'' out of a total of 907 schools and #87 in their ''2017 College Readiness Ranking in NY'' out of a total of 1,165 schools. [[U.S. News]] continuously ranks Millennium High School as one of the best high schools in NY and nationwide, earning Gold Medals and Silver Medals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4348">{{accounting}}
In [[accounting]], '''minority interest''' (or '''non-controlling interest''') is the portion of a subsidiary corporation's stock that is not owned by the parent corporation. The magnitude of the minority interest in the subsidiary company is generally less than 50% of [[shares outstanding|outstanding shares]], or the corporation would generally cease to be a subsidiary of the parent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.groco.com/readingroom/bus_dloc_mid.aspx. The Minority Interest Discount&lt;/ref&gt;

It is, however, possible (such as through special voting rights) for a controlling interest requiring consolidation to be achieved without exceeding 50% ownership, depending on the accounting standards being employed. Minority interest belongs to other investors and is reported on the consolidated [[balance sheet]] of the owning company to reflect the claim on [[assets]] belonging to other, non-controlling shareholders. Also, minority interest is reported on the consolidated [[income statement]] as a share of profit belonging to minority shareholders.

The reporting of 'minority interest' is a consequence of the requirement by [[accounting standards]] to 'fully' consolidate partly owned subsidiaries. Full consolidation, as opposed to partial consolidation, results in financial statements that are constructed as if the parent corporation fully owns these partly owned subsidiaries; except for two line items that reflect partial ownership of subsidiaries: net income to common shareholders and common equity. The two minority interest line items are the net difference between what would have been the common equity and net income to common, if all subsidiaries were fully owned, and the actual ownership of the group. All the other line items in the financial statements assume a fictitious 100% ownership.

Some investors have expressed concern that the minority interest line items cause significant uncertainty for the assessment of value, leverage and liquidity.&lt;ref&gt;http://eumedion.nl/en/public/knowledgenetwork/position-papers/position_paper_full_consolidation_of_partly_owned_subsidiaries_requires_additional_disclosure.pdf.  Position paper by corporate governance forum 'Eumedion'&lt;/ref&gt; A key concern of investors is that they cannot be sure what part of the reported cash position is owned by a 100% subsidiary and what part is owned by a 51% subsidiary.

Minority interest is an integral part of the [[enterprise value]] of a company. The converse concept is an [[associate company]].

==Accounting treatment==
Under the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]], the non-controlling interest is reported in accordance with [[IFRS 5]] and is shown at the very bottom of the Equity section on the consolidated [[balance sheet]] and subsequently on the [[statement of changes in equity]]. Under [[US GAAP]] minority interest can be reported either in the liabilities section, the equity section, or the mezzanine section of the balance sheet. The Mezzanine section is located between liabilities and equity. FASB FAS 160 and FAS 141r significantly alter the way a parent company accounts for non-controlling interest (NCI) in a subsidiary. It is no longer acceptable to report minority interest in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet.

The '''Neglected firm effect''' is the phenomenon of lesser-known firms producing abnormally high [[Return on investment|returns]] on their [[stock]]s. The companies that are followed by fewer [[Financial analyst|analysts]] will earn higher returns on average than companies that are followed by many analysts. The abnormally high return exhibited by neglected firms may be due to the lower [[liquidity]] or higher risks associated with the stock.

According to [[Investopedia]]: "Neglected firms are usually the small firms that analysts tend to ignore. Information available on these companies tends to be limited to those items that are required by law, on the other hand, have a higher profile, which provides large amounts of high quality information (in addition to legally required forms) to institutional investors such as [[pension]] or [[mutual fund]] companies." &lt;!-- see talk page --&gt;

'''Noël Le Graët''' (born December 25, 1941 in [[Bourbriac]], [[Côtes-d'Armor]]) is a [[France|French]] [[businessman]], [[politician]] and football official. Since 18 June 2011 he has been the President of the [[French Football Federation]] (FFF).&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110618/sp_soccer_afp/fblfrafederationvote Yahoo News: Le Graet elected as French football chief] June 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/feedarticle/9701525 The Guardian: Le Graet elected French federation president] June 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was the [[vice-president]] of the French federation from 2005 to 2011.

== FFF career  ==
He is very influential within the FFF. Between 1991 and 2000 he was President of [[Ligue 1]], the French professional league and was vice-president of FFF. In this position, he has brought - through acquisition of new sponsors, including of a new supplier contract with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] - a substantial improvement of the financial situation of the FFF. Following the resignation of its president, [[Jean-Pierre Escalettes]] because of the fiasco of the [[France national football team|French national football team]] at the [[2010 World Cup]], Noël Le Graët became as a likely candidate for interim Fernand Duchaussoy to succeed him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxifoot.fr/football/article-10810.htm FFF: Le Graët, a new head to stop war of clans?] 22.

'''Sir Patrick Walsh''' (fl. 1580 – c.1610) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[ambassador]] and [[friar]]. Patrick Walsh was a [[knight]] and wealthy merchant in the city of Waterford, becoming [[Mayor of Waterford]] in 1578. He was an older half-brother of [[Thomas Walsh (archbishop of Cashel)|Thomas Walsh]], [[Archbishop of Cashel]] 1626–54. Another brother, Richard Walsh, was a [[Jesuit]]. (1992, n. 28, p.&amp;nbsp;191). 

==Biography==
It was in his capacity as Mayor that Walsh first came to notice, acting as a “representative from the ‘’Urbs Intacta’’ to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]”. [[Marmaduke Middleton]], [[Protestant]] [[Bishop of Waterford and Lismore]], wrote of Walsh in a letter to Sir [[Francis Walsingham]] dated 29 June 1580, describing the citizens of Waterford as “stiffnecked, stubborn, papistical and incorrigible’’. He attributed their stance to Walsh, saying of him:

‘’the greatest support of this is he, which was the last year mayor, whose name is Sir Patrick Walsh, a counterfeit Christian, and a great enemy of God’s truth. And [he] is coming over to obtain something of her Majesty to maintain his knighthood withal ... Wherein I dare be bold to say, no man exceedeth the said Sir Patrick, with whom, the living God knoweth, the whole city are partakers.’’ (State papers concerning the Irish Church in the time of Queen Elizabeth, p. 41, W. M. Brady, ed. (and 1992, p. 10) 

Walsh was married. However, he and his wife entered into a pact that upon the death of one of them, the survivor could enter a religious order. In 1598, after the death of his wife, Walsh sailed to France, joining the Capuchin order at Paris, where he died about 1610. Yet even up to the time of his death his advice was regularly sought by citizens of Waterford on municipal matters, such was his esteem in the town. 

F. X. Martin writes “Though it is probable that Walsh knew [[Francis Lavalin Nugent]] at Paris he did not join the Irish mission. Like [[Patrick Bath]] he died before it became a reality in 1615 with the acquisition of a [[friary]] at [[Charleville-Mézières|Charleville]] in northern France as headquarters for the Irish Capuchins.”

X. Martin, in “Ireland and France: a Bountiful Friendship”, pp.&amp;nbsp;7–16,  ed. Hayley and Murray, Colin Smythe Ltd., 1992.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39997">'''Pharmacokinetics''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ''pharmakon'' "drug" and ''kinetikos'' "moving, putting in motion"; see [[chemical kinetics]]), sometimes abbreviated as '''PK''',  is a branch of [[pharmacology]] dedicated to determining the fate of substances administered to a living organism. The substances of interest include any chemical [[xenobiotic]] such as: [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, [[pesticide]]s, [[food additive]]s, [[cosmetics]], etc. It attempts to analyze chemical [[metabolism]] and to discover the fate of a chemical from the moment that it is administered up to the point at which it is completely [[excreted|eliminated from the body]]. Pharmacokinetics is the study of how an organism affects a drug, whereas [[pharmacodynamics]] (PD) is the study of how the drug affects the organism. Both together influence [[dosing]], benefit, and [[adverse effect]]s, as seen in [[PK/PD models]].

==Overview==
Pharmacokinetics describes how the body affects a specific xenobiotic/chemical after administration through the mechanisms of absorption and distribution, as well as the metabolic changes of the substance in the body (e.g. by metabolic [[enzyme]]s such as [[cytochrome P450]] or [[glucuronosyltransferase]] enzymes), and the effects and routes of excretion of the metabolites of the drug.&lt;ref&gt;Pharmacokinetics. (2006). In ''[[Mosby's Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing &amp; Health Professions]]''. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier Health Sciences. Retrieved December 11, 2008, from http://www.credoreference.com/entry/6686418&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmacokinetic properties of chemicals are affected by the route of administration and the dose of administered drug. These may affect the absorption rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Kathleen | last1 = Knights | first2 = Bronwen | last2 = Bryant | name-list-format = vanc | title = Pharmacology for Health Professionals | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam | year = 2002 | pages = | isbn = 0-7295-3664-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Models have been developed to simplify conceptualization of the many processes that take place in the interaction between an organism and a chemical substance. One of these, the [[pharmacokinetics#Multi-compartmental models|multi-compartmental model]], is the most commonly used  approximations to reality; however, the complexity involved in adding parameters with that modelling approach means that ''monocompartmental models'' and above all ''two compartmental models'' are the most-frequently used. The various compartments that the model is divided into are commonly referred to as the [[ADME]] scheme (also referred to as LADME if liberation is included as a separate step from absorption):
* [[Liberation (pharmacology)|'''&lt;u&gt;L&lt;/u&gt;'''iberation]] – the process of release of a drug from the [[pharmaceutical formulation]].&lt;ref name="KochRitschel1986"&gt;{{cite book | title = Synopsis der Biopharmazie und Pharmakokinetik | vauthors = Koch HP, Ritschel WA | year = 1986 | publisher = Ecomed | location = Landsberg, München | language = German | isbn = 3-609-64970-4 | chapter = Liberation | pages = 99–131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17630642"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruiz-Garcia A, Bermejo M, Moss A, Casabo VG | title = Pharmacokinetics in drug discovery | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences | volume = 97 | issue = 2 | pages = 654–90 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 17630642 | doi = 10.1002/jps.21009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[IVIVC]].
* [[Absorption (pharmacokinetics)|'''&lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;'''bsorption]] – the process of a substance entering the blood circulation.
* [[Distribution (pharmacology)|'''&lt;u&gt;D&lt;/u&gt;'''istribution]] – the dispersion or dissemination of substances throughout the fluids and tissues of the body.
* [[Metabolism|'''&lt;u&gt;M&lt;/u&gt;'''etabolism]] (or biotransformation, or inactivation) – the recognition by the organism that a foreign substance is present and the irreversible transformation of parent compounds into daughter metabolites.
* [[Elimination (pharmacology)|'''&lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;'''xcretion]] – the removal of the substances from the body. In rare cases, some [[drugs]] irreversibly accumulate in [[body tissue]]. {{Citation needed|reason=This is a strong claim and should be backed by literature reference(s)|date=February 2018}}

The two phases of metabolism and excretion can also be grouped together under the title elimination.
The study of these distinct phases involves the use and manipulation of basic concepts in order to understand the process dynamics. For this reason in order to fully comprehend the ''kinetics'' of a drug it is necessary to have detailed knowledge of a number of factors such as: the properties of the substances that act as [[excipient]]s, the characteristics of the appropriate [[Cell membrane|biological membranes]] and the way that substances can cross them, or the characteristics of the [[enzyme kinetics|enzyme reactions]] that inactivate the drug.

All these concepts can be represented through [[Expression (mathematics)|mathematical formulas]] that have a corresponding [[Graph of a function|graphical representation]]. The use of these models allows an understanding of the characteristics of a [[molecule]], as well as how a particular drug will behave given information regarding some of its basic characteristics such as its [[acid dissociation constant]] (pKa), [[bioavailability]] and [[solubility]], absorption capacity and distribution in the organism.

The model outputs for a drug can be used in industry (for example, in calculating [[bioequivalence]] when designing generic drugs) or in the clinical application of pharmacokinetic concepts. Clinical pharmacokinetics provides many performance guidelines for effective and efficient use of drugs for human-health professionals and in [[veterinary medicine]].

== Metrics ==
The following are the most commonly measured pharmacokinetic metrics:&lt;ref name="urlwww.agah.info"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.agah.eu/fileadmin/_migrated/content_uploads/PK-glossary_PK_working_group_2004.pdf |title = Collection of terms, symbols, equations, and explanations of common pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters and some statistical functions |author = AGAH working group PHARMACOKINETICS |date = 2004-02-16 |format = PDF |publisher = Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Angewandte Humanpharmakologie (AGAH) (Association for Applied Human Pharmacology) |accessdate = 2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{DoseConcentrationClearance}}
{{anchor|steady state}}
In pharmacokinetics, ''steady state'' refers to the situation where the overall intake of a drug is fairly in [[dynamic equilibrium]] with its elimination. In practice, it is generally considered that steady state is reached when a time of 4 to 5 times the half-life for a drug after regular dosing is started.

The following graph depicts a typical time course of drug plasma concentration and illustrates main pharmacokinetic metrics:
[[File:Linear PK Example.png|400px|thumb|left|The time course of drug plasma concentrations over 96 hours following oral administrations every 24 hours. Note that the AUC in steady state equals AUC&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; after the first dose.]]

== Pharmacokinetic models ==
Pharmacokinetic modelling is performed by noncompartmental or [[compartment (pharmacokinetics)|compartment]]al methods. Noncompartmental methods estimate the exposure to a drug by estimating the [[integral|area under the curve]] of a concentration-time graph. Compartmental methods estimate the concentration-time graph using kinetic models. Noncompartmental methods are often more versatile in that they do not assume any specific compartmental model and produce accurate results also acceptable for bioequivalence studies.
The final outcome of the transformations that a drug undergoes in an organism and the rules that determine this fate depend on a number of interrelated factors. A number of functional models have been developed in order to simplify the study of pharmacokinetics. These models are based on a consideration of an organism as a number of related compartments. The simplest idea is to think of an organism as only one homogenous compartment. This ''monocompartmental model'' presupposes that [[blood plasma]] concentrations of the drug are a true reflection of the drug’s concentration in other fluids or tissues and that the elimination of the drug is directly proportional to the drug’s concentration in the organism ([[first order kinetics]]).

However, these models do not always truly reflect the real situation within an organism. For example, not all body tissues have the same [[blood| blood supply]], so the distribution of the drug will be slower in these tissues than in others with a better blood supply. In addition, there are some tissues (such as the [[brain]] tissue) that present a real barrier to the distribution of drugs, that can be breached with greater or lesser ease depending on the drug’s characteristics. If these relative conditions for the different tissue types are considered along with the rate of elimination, the organism can be considered to be acting like two compartments: one that we can call the ''central compartment'' that has a more rapid distribution, comprising organs and systems with a well-developed blood supply; and a ''peripheral compartment'' made up of organs with a lower blood flow. Other tissues, such as the brain, can occupy a variable position depending on a drug’s ability to cross the [[Blood–brain barrier|barrier]] that separates the organ from the blood supply.

This ''two compartment model'' will vary depending on which compartment elimination occurs in. The most common situation is that elimination occurs in the central compartment as the [[liver]] and [[kidneys]] are organs with a good blood supply. However, in some situations it may be that elimination occurs in the peripheral compartment or even in both. This can mean that there are three possible variations in the two compartment model, which still do not cover all possibilities.&lt;ref name="Reverte"&gt;Milo Gibaldi, Donald Perrier. ''Farmacocinética''Reverté 1982 pages 1–10. {{ISBN|84-291-5535-X}}, 9788429155358&lt;/ref&gt;

This model may not be applicable in situations where some of the enzymes responsible for metabolizing the drug become saturated, or where an active elimination mechanism is present that is independent of the drug's plasma concentration. In the real world each tissue will have its own distribution characteristics and none of them will be strictly linear. If we label the drug’s [[volume of distribution]] within the organism '''Vd&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''' and its volume of distribution in a tissue '''Vd&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''' the former will be described by an equation that takes into account all the tissues that act in different ways, that is:

: &lt;math&gt;Vd_F = Vd_{T1} + Vd_{T2} + Vd_{T3} + \cdots + Vd_{Tn}\,&lt;/math&gt;

This represents the ''multi-compartment model'' with a number of curves that express complicated equations in order to obtain an overall curve. A number of [[computer program]]s have been developed to plot these equations.&lt;ref name="Reverte" /&gt; However complicated and precise this model may be, it still does not truly represent reality despite the effort involved in obtaining various distribution values for a drug. This is because the concept of distribution volume is a relative concept that is not a true reflection of reality. The choice of model therefore comes down to deciding which one offers the lowest margin of error for the drug involved.

===Noncompartmental analysis===
Noncompartmental PK analysis is highly dependent on estimation of total drug exposure. Total drug exposure is most often estimated by area under the curve (AUC) methods, with the [[trapezoidal rule]] ([[numerical integration]]) the most common method. Due to the dependence on the length of ''x'' in the trapezoidal rule, the area estimation is highly dependent on the blood/plasma sampling schedule. That is, the closer time points are, the closer the trapezoids reflect the actual shape of the concentration-time curve.

===Compartmental analysis===
[[Multi-compartment model|Compartmental]] PK analysis uses kinetic models to describe and predict the concentration-time curve. PK compartmental models are often similar to kinetic models used in other scientific disciplines such as [[chemical kinetics]] and [[thermodynamics]]. The advantage of compartmental over some noncompartmental analyses is the ability to predict the concentration at any time. The disadvantage is the difficulty in developing and validating the proper model. Compartment-free modelling based on curve stripping does not suffer this limitation. The simplest PK compartmental model is the one-compartmental PK model with IV bolus administration and [[Biological half-life#First-order elimination|first-order elimination]]. The most complex PK models (called [[PBPK]] models) rely on the use of physiological information to ease development and validation.

=== Single-compartment model ===
''Linear pharmacokinetics'' is so-called because the graph of the relationship between the various factors involved ([[dose (biochemistry)|dose]], blood plasma concentrations, elimination, etc.) gives a [[line (geometry)|straight line]] or an approximation to one. For drugs to be effective they need to be able to move rapidly from blood plasma to other body fluids and tissues.

The change in concentration over time can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;C=C_\text{initial} \times e^{-k_\text{el} \times t}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Multi-compartmental models ===
[[File:Farmacocinética no lineal.svg|thumb|200px| Graphs for absorption and elimination for a non-linear pharmacokinetic model.]]
The graph for the non-linear relationship between the various factors is represented by a [[curve]]; the relationships between the factors can then be found by calculating the dimensions of different areas under the curve. The models used in ''non-linear pharmacokinetics'' are largely based on [[Michaelis–Menten kinetics]].
A reaction’s factors of non-linearity include the following:
* Multiphasic absorption: Drugs injected [[intravenous therapy|intravenously]] are removed from the plasma through two primary mechanisms: (1) Distribution to body tissues and (2) metabolism + excretion of the drugs. The resulting decrease of the drug's plasma concentration follows a biphasic pattern (see figure).[[File:Iv time conc curve.svg|thumb|Plasma drug concentration vs time after an IV dose]]
** '''Alpha phase''': An initial phase of rapid decrease in plasma concentration. The decrease is primarily attributed to drug distribution from the central compartment (circulation) into the peripheral compartments (body tissues). This phase ends when a pseudo-equilibrium of drug concentration is established between the central and peripheral compartments.
** '''Beta phase''': A phase of gradual decrease in plasma concentration after the alpha phase. The decrease is primarily attributed to drug metabolism and excretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gill SC, Moon-Mcdermott L, Hunt TL, Deresinski S, Blaschke T, Sandhaus RA |title=Phase I Pharmacokinetics of Liposomal Amikacin (MiKasome) in Human Subjects: Dose Dependence and Urinary Clearance | journal = Abstr Intersci Conf Antimicrob Agents Chemother |date=Sep 1999 | page = 33 (abstract no. 1195) | volume = 39 | url = http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/MeetingAbstracts/ma?f=102244695.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Additional phases (gamma, delta, etc.) are sometimes seen.&lt;ref name="isbn91-86274-92-9"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Daniel | last1 = Weiner | first2 = Johan | last2 = Gabrielsson | name-list-format = vanc | title = Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data analysis: concepts and applications | publisher = Apotekarsocieteten | location = | year = 2000 | pages = 527–36 | isbn = 91-86274-92-9 | url =  https://books.google.com/?id=K-gT2_Ukk0QC&amp;lpg=PA529&amp;dq=pharmacokinetic%20alpha%20beta%20gamma%20phase&amp;pg=PA528#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | chapter = PK24 – Non-linear kinetics – flow II }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A drug’s characteristics make a clear distinction between tissues with high and low blood flow.
* Enzymatic [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturation]]: When the dose of a drug whose elimination depends on biotransformation is increased above a certain threshold the enzymes responsible for its metabolism become saturated. The drug’s plasma concentration will then increase disproportionately and its elimination will no longer be constant.
* Induction or [[Enzyme inhibitor|enzymatic inhibition]]: Some drugs have the capacity to inhibit or stimulate their own metabolism, in negative or [[Positive feedback#In biology|positive feedback]] reactions. As occurs with [[fluvoxamine]], [[fluoxetine]] and [[phenytoin]]. As larger doses of these pharmaceuticals are administered the plasma concentrations of the unmetabolized drug increases and the [[Biological half-life|elimination half-life]] increases. It is therefore necessary to adjust the dose or other treatment parameters when a high dosage is required.
* The kidneys can also establish active elimination mechanisms for some drugs, independent of plasma concentrations.

It can therefore be seen that non-linearity can occur because of reasons that affect the entire pharmacokinetic sequence: absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination.

=== Variable volume in time models ===

[[Variable volume pharmacokinetic models]] can be drug centered models that imply a volume of drug distribution to be that volume in which the drug is distributed at that elapsed time following drug administration.&lt;ref name="Niazi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Niazi S | title = Volume of distribution as a function of time | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences | volume = 65 | issue = 3 | pages = 452–4 | date = March 1976 | pmid = 1263103 | doi=10.1002/jps.2600650339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wesolowski"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wesolowski CA, Wesolowski MJ, Babyn PS, Wanasundara SN | title = Time Varying Apparent Volume of Distribution and Drug Half-Lives Following Intravenous Bolus Injections | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = e0158798 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27403663 | pmc = 4942076 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0158798 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1158798W }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another possibility occurs when the body volume is changing in time, which would occur, for example, during dialysis when the volume in which a drug can be distributed is itself changing in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim DK, Lee JC, Lee H, Joo KW, Oh KH, Kim YS, Yoon HJ, Kim HC | title = Calculation of the clearance requirements for the development of a hemodialysis-based wearable artificial kidney | journal = Hemodialysis International. International Symposium on Home Hemodialysis | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 226–34 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26245302 | doi = 10.1111/hdi.12343 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bioavailability ==
{{Main | Bioavailability}}
At a practical level, a drug’s bioavailability can be defined as the proportion of the drug that reaches its site of action. From this perspective the [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] administration of a drug provides the greatest possible bioavailability, and this method is considered to yield a bioavailability of 1 (or 100%). Bioavailability of other delivery methods is compared with that of intravenous injection («absolute bioavailability») or to a standard value related to other delivery methods in a particular study («relative bioavailability»).

: &lt;math&gt;B_A = \frac{[ABC]_P \cdot D_{IV}}{[ABC]_{IV} \cdot D_P}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathit B_R = \frac{[ABC]_A \cdot \text{dose}_B}{[ABC]_B \cdot \text{dose}_A}&lt;/math&gt;

Once a drug’s bioavailability has been established it is possible to calculate the changes that need to be made to its dosage in order to reach the required blood plasma levels. Bioavailability is therefore a mathematical factor for each individual drug that influences the administered dose. It is possible to calculate the amount of a drug in the blood plasma that has a real potential to bring about its effect using the formula: &lt;math&gt;De = B \cdot Da\,&lt;/math&gt;; where ''De'' is the [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|effective dose]], ''B'' bioavailability and ''Da'' the administered dose.

Therefore, if a drug has a bioavailability of 0.8 (or 80%) and it is administered in a dose of 100&amp;nbsp;mg, the equation will demonstrate the following:

&lt;center&gt; ''De'' = 0.8 × 100 mg = 80 mg &lt;/center&gt;

That is the 100&amp;nbsp;mg administered represents a blood plasma concentration of 80&amp;nbsp;mg that has the capacity to have a pharmaceutical effect.

[[File:Pill box with pills.JPG|thumb|200px| Different forms of tablets, which will have different pharmacokinetic behaviours after their administration.]]
This concept depends on a series of factors inherent to each drug, such as:&lt;ref name="Winter" &gt;Michael E. Winter, Mary Anne Koda-Kimple, Lloyd Y. Young, Emilio Pol Yanguas ''Farmacocinética clínica básica'' Ediciones Díaz de Santos, 1994 pgs. 8–14 {{ISBN|84-7978-147-5}}, 9788479781477 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pharmaceutical drug|Pharmaceutical form]]
* Chemical form
* [[Route of administration]]
* Stability
* [[Metabolism]]

These concepts, which are discussed in detail in their respective titled articles, can be mathematically quantified and integrated to obtain an overall mathematical equation:

: &lt;math&gt;De = Q\cdot Da\cdot B\,&lt;/math&gt;

where '''Q''' is the drug’s purity.&lt;ref name="Winter" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;Va = \frac{Da \cdot B \cdot Q} \tau &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Va&lt;/math&gt; is the drug’s rate of administration and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the rate at which the absorbed drug reaches the circulatory system.

Finally, using the [[Henderson-Hasselbalch equation]], and knowing the drug’s &lt;math&gt;pKa\,&lt;/math&gt; ([[pH]] at which there is an equilibrium between its ionized and non ionized molecules), it is possible to calculate the non ionized concentration of the drug and therefore the concentration that will be subject to absorption:

: &lt;math&gt;pH = pKa + \log \frac B A &lt;/math&gt;

When two drugs have the same bioavailability, they are said to be biological equivalents or bioequivalents. This concept of [[bioequivalence]] is important because it is currently used as a yardstick in the authorization of [[generic drug]]s in many countries.

== LADME ==
{{Main | ADME}}

A number of phases occur once the drug enters into contact with the organism, these are described using the acronym LADME:
* [[Liberation (pharmacology)|Liberation]] of the active substance from the delivery system,
* [[Absorption (pharmacokinetics)|Absorption]] of the active substance by the organism,
* [[Distribution (pharmacology)|Distribution]] through the blood plasma and different body tissues,
* [[Metabolism]] that is inactivation of the xenobiotic substance, and finally
* [[Excretion]] or [[elimination (pharmacology)|elimination]] of the substance or the products of its metabolism.

Some textbooks combine the first two phases as the drug is often administered in an active form, which means that there is no liberation phase. Others include a phase that combines distribution, metabolism and excretion into a disposition phase. Other authors include the drug’s toxicological aspect in what is known as ''ADME-Tox'' or ''ADMET''.

Each of the phases is subject to physico-chemical interactions between a drug and an organism, which can be expressed mathematically. Pharmacokinetics is therefore based on mathematical equations that allow the prediction of a drug’s behavior and which place great emphasis on the relationships between drug plasma concentrations and the time elapsed since the drug’s administration.

==Analysis==

=== Bioanalytical methods ===
[[Bioanalysis|Bioanalytical methods]] are necessary to construct a concentration-time profile. Chemical techniques are employed to measure the concentration of drugs in [[biological matrix]], most often plasma. Proper bioanalytical methods should be selective and sensitive. For example, [[microscale thermophoresis]] can be used to quantify how the biological matrix/liquid affects the affinity of a drug to its target.&lt;ref name=Baaske&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baaske P, Wienken CJ, Reineck P, Duhr S, Braun D | title = Optical thermophoresis for quantifying the buffer dependence of aptamer binding | journal = Angewandte Chemie | volume = 49 | issue = 12 | pages = 2238–41 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20186894 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/anie.200903998 | laysummary = http://www.physorg.com/news186225693.html | laysource = Phsyorg.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wienken&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wienken CJ, Baaske P, Rothbauer U, Braun D, Duhr S | title = Protein-binding assays in biological liquids using microscale thermophoresis | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 1 | issue = 7 | pages = 100 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20981028 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms1093 | bibcode = 2010NatCo...1E.100W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mass spectrometry ===
Pharmacokinetics is often studied using [[mass spectrometry]] because of the complex nature of the matrix (often plasma or urine) and the need for high sensitivity to observe concentrations after a low dose and a long time period. The most common instrumentation used in this application is [[liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] with a [[quadrupole mass analyzer|triple quadrupole mass spectrometer]]. [[Tandem mass spectrometry]] is usually employed for added specificity. Standard curves and internal standards are used for quantitation of usually a single pharmaceutical in the samples. The samples represent different time points as a pharmaceutical is administered and then metabolized or cleared from the body. Blank samples taken before administration are important in determining background and ensuring data integrity with such complex sample matrices. Much attention is paid to the linearity of the standard curve; however it is common to use [[curve fitting]] with more complex functions such as [[quadratic function|quadratics]] since the response of most mass spectrometers is not linear across large concentration ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsieh Y, Korfmacher WA | title = Increasing speed and throughput when using HPLC-MS/MS systems for drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic screening | journal = Current Drug Metabolism | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 479–89 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16787157 | doi = 10.2174/138920006777697963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Covey TR, Lee ED, Henion JD | title = High-speed liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry for the determination of drugs in biological samples | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 58 | issue = 12 | pages = 2453–60 | date = October 1986 | pmid = 3789400 | doi = 10.1021/ac00125a022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Covey TR, Crowther JB, Dewey EA, Henion JD | title = Thermospray liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry determination of drugs and their metabolites in biological fluids | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 474–81 | date = February 1985 | pmid = 3977076 | doi = 10.1021/ac50001a036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is currently considerable interest in the use of very high sensitivity mass spectrometry for [[microdosing]] studies, which are seen as a promising alternative to [[animal experimentation]].&lt;ref name="EMEA-MD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2009/09/WC500002720.pdf|format=PDF|title=ICH guideline M3(R2) on non-clinical safety studies for the conduct of human clinical trials and marketing authorisation for pharmaceuticals |author = Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) |date=December 2009 |id=EMA/CPMP/ICH/286/1995 |publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]], Evaluation of Medicines for Human Use |accessdate= 4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population pharmacokinetics==
''Population pharmacokinetics'' is the study of the sources and correlates of variability in drug concentrations among individuals who are the target patient population receiving clinically relevant doses of a drug of interest.&lt;ref name="pmid925881"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheiner LB, Rosenberg B, Marathe VV | title = Estimation of population characteristics of pharmacokinetic parameters from routine clinical data | journal = Journal of Pharmacokinetics and Biopharmaceutics | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 445–79 | date = October 1977 | pmid = 925881 | doi = 10.1007/BF01061728 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid466923"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheiner LB, Beal S, Rosenberg B, Marathe VV | title = Forecasting individual pharmacokinetics | journal = Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 294–305 | date = September 1979 | pmid = 466923 | doi =  10.1002/cpt1979263294}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16353916"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bonate PL | title = Recommended reading in population pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamics | journal = The AAPS Journal | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = E363–73 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16353916 | pmc = 2750974 | doi = 10.1208/aapsj070237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain patient demographic, pathophysiological, and therapeutical features, such as body weight, excretory and metabolic functions, and the presence of other therapies, can regularly alter dose-concentration relationships. For example, steady-state concentrations of drugs eliminated mostly by the kidney are usually greater in patients suffering from renal failure than they are in patients with normal renal function receiving the same drug dosage. Population pharmacokinetics seeks to identify the measurable pathophysiologic factors that cause changes in the dose-concentration relationship and the extent of these changes so that, if such changes are associated with clinically significant shifts in the therapeutic index, dosage can be appropriately modified.
An advantage of population pharmacokinetic modelling is its ability to analyse sparse data sets (sometimes only one concentration measurement per patient is available).

== Clinical pharmacokinetics ==

Clinical pharmacokinetics (arising from the clinical use of population pharmacokinetics) is the direct application to a therapeutic situation of knowledge regarding a drug’s pharmacokinetics and the characteristics of a population that a patient belongs to (or can be ascribed to).

An example is the relaunch of the use of [[ciclosporin]] as an [[Immunosuppressive drug|immunosuppressor]] to facilitate organ transplant. The drug's therapeutic properties were initially demonstrated, but it was almost never used after it was found to cause [[nephrotoxicity]] in a number of patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first2 = R.|last2= García del Moral|first3= M.|last3= Andujar |first1=F.|last1= O'Valle |url = http://www.revistanefrologia.com/es-publicacion-nefrologia-articulo-mecanismos-nefrotoxicidad-por-ciclosporina-a-nivel-celular-X0211699595022690|title = Mecanismos de nefrotoxicidad por ciclosporina A a nivel celular|language =Spanish|journal = Nefrologia|volume = 15 Supplement 1|date = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was then realized that it was possible to individualize a patient's dose of ciclosporin by analysing the patients plasmatic concentrations (pharmacokinetic monitoring). This practice has allowed this drug to be used again and has facilitated a great number of organ transplants.

Clinical monitoring is usually carried out by determination of plasma concentrations as this data is usually the easiest to obtain and the most reliable. The main reasons for determining a drug’s plasma concentration include:&lt;ref&gt;Joaquín Herrera Carranza [https://books.google.com/books?id=7Vw7a4wBzRgC Manual de farmacia clínica y Atención Farmacéutica] (in Spanish). Published by Elsevier España, 2003; page 159. {{ISBN|84-8174-658-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philippe Suchard''' (9 October 1797 &amp;ndash; 14 January 1884) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[chocolatier]] and [[industrialist]].

==Biography==
Suchard was born in 1797 in [[Boudry]]. According to the [[memoirs]] of his sister Rosalie, he became aware of the potentialities of chocolate manufacturing as an industry at the very early age of about twelve.&lt;ref name=swissworld&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.swissworld.org/en/people/portraits_chocolate_makers/philippe_suchard/ | title = Philippe Suchard biography | accessdate=2008-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; To fulfill his dream, six years later he started as an apprentice in his brother Frédéric's ''[[Konditorei]]'' in [[Bern]]. In 1824 he left Switzerland to visit the [[United States]]. At the end of the year he returned and opened a confectioner's business in Neuchâtel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finedarkchocolate.com/Swiss_Chocolate/Philippe_Suchard.asp |title=Philippe Suchard (1797&amp;ndash;1884), Swiss Master Chocolate Maker |accessdate=2009-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114022927/http://www.finedarkchocolate.com/Swiss_Chocolate/PHILIPPE_SUCHARD.asp |archivedate=November 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1826, Suchard opened the factory of Chocolat Suchard in [[Serrières, Neuchâtel|Serrières]]. He used [[hydropower]] of the nearby river to run the mills in his two-man factory. Suchard used a grinding mill consisting of a heated [[granite]] plate, and several granite rollers moving forwards and backwards. This design is still used to grind [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] paste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://brandstell.com/index.php?cmd=news_full_text&amp;type=arch&amp;id=1026&amp;lang=en | title = Milka | accessdate = 2008-09-07 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708091006/http://brandstell.com/index.php?cmd=news_full_text&amp;type=arch&amp;id=1026&amp;lang=en | archivedate = 2011-07-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chocolate was not cheap or a product for everybody. Suchard struggled financially early in his career as a chocolatier. His success came in 1842, with a bulk order from [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV, king of Prussia]], who was also the prince of [[Neuchâtel]]. This triggered a boom and soon his chocolates won prizes at the London [[Great Exhibition of 1851]] and the Paris [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Universal Exposition of 1855]]. He opened his first factory abroad in 1880 in [[Lörrach]], [[Germany]], becoming the first to do so. The unusual purple color of the chocolate packaging was selected by Suchard, who believed it would be unique among chocolate packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://brandstell.com/index.php?cmd=news_full_text&amp;type=arch&amp;id=1027&amp;lang=en | title = Brand News | accessdate = 2008-09-07 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708091508/http://brandstell.com/index.php?cmd=news_full_text&amp;type=arch&amp;id=1027&amp;lang=en | archivedate = 2011-07-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, Suchard had become the largest chocolate producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chocosuisse.ch/page/2_1_geschichte-en.html | title = From cocoa to chocolate | accessdate=2008-09-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080501145719/http://www.chocosuisse.ch/page/2_1_geschichte-en.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen years after his death in 1884 in Neuchâtel, his company produced the famous [[Milka]] chocolate for the Swiss market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theobroma-cacao.de/wissen/geschichte/personen/philippe-suchard/ | title = Lebenslauf von Philippe Suchard | accessdate=2008-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, his daughter Eugénie Suchard and her husband Karl Russ-Suchard, took over the functioning of his factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.le-musee.ch/500-Animations/veillee050608.htm | title = Philippe Suchard: de Boudry à l'Orient du Minaret | accessdate=2008-09-09| language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays the factory belongs to the [[Mondelez]] group and production has been moved to the [[Toblerone]] factory in Bern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kraftfoods.ch/kraft/page?siteid=kraft-prd&amp;locale=chde1&amp;PagecRef=2505&amp;Mid=2505 | title= Süsse Fakten zu Milka, Toblerone und Suchard | language = German | accessdate = 2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suchard was not only a chocolatier but also had interest in other areas. In 1834 he introduced and captained the first [[steamboat|steamer]], ''Industriel'', on [[Lake Neuchâtel]]. He also tried introducing [[silkworm]] culture in Switzerland in 1837, but the silkworms were destroyed during an epidemic in 1843. His interest in managing river water and controlling floods led to the sinking of the water level in Lake Neuchâtel. The lowered lake shoreline revealed the [[Celts|Celtic]] settlement of [[La Tène]] dating back to around 450 BC.&lt;ref name=swissworld /&gt;

The '''President''' is a leader of an organization, company, community, club, trade union, university or other group. The relationship between the president and the [[Chief Executive Officer]] varies, depending on the structure of the specific organization. In a similar vein to the [[Chief Operating Officer]], the title of corporate President as a separate position (as opposed to being combined with a "[[Corporate_title#Senior_management|C-Suite]]" designation, such as "President and Chief Executive Officer" or "President and Chief Operating Officer") is also loosely defined; the President is usually the legally recognized highest rank of corporate officer, ranking above the various [[Vice_president#In_business|Vice Presidents]] (including Senior Vice President and Executive Vice President), but on its own generally considered subordinate, in practice, to the CEO. The powers of the president vary widely across organizations and such powers come from specific authorization in the bylaws (e.g. the president can make an "executive decision" only if the bylaws allow for it).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = [[Robert's Rules of Order]] Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 456|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally, the term "president" was used to designate someone who presided over a meeting, and was used in the same way that "foreman" or "overseer" is used now (the term is still used in that sense today).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='President' Once Meant Little More Than 'Foreman'|author=Guy Raz|date=December 14, 2013|work=npr.org|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=250990126|accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/president?s=t|title = President|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-19|website = |publisher = Dictionary.com|quote = a person who presides.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has now also come to mean "chief officer" in terms of administrative or executive duties.

== Duties at meetings ==
[[File:AGM Annual General Meeting of a typical small (141 member) volunteer organisation.jpg|thumb|President presiding over the AGM of a small volunteer organization. President sitting at the left of table in the background]]
In addition to the administrative or executive duties in organizations, the president has the duties of presiding over meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such duties at meetings include:
* calling the meeting to order
* determining if a [[quorum]] is present
* announcing the items on the [[order of business]] or [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]] as they come up
* [[Recognition (parliamentary procedure)|recognition]] of members to have the [[Floor (legislative)|floor]]
* enforcing the rules of the group
* putting all questions ([[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]]) to a vote
* adjourning the meeting
While presiding, the president should remain impartial and not interrupt a speaker if the speaker has the floor and is following the rules of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 44}}: "The presiding officer must never interrupt a speaker simply because he knows more about the matter than the speaker does."&lt;/ref&gt; In committees or small boards, the president votes along with the other members. However, in assemblies or larger boards, the president should vote only when it can affect the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#1|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 1)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-19|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a meeting, the president only has one vote (i.e. the president cannot vote twice and cannot override the decision of the group unless the organization has specifically given the president such authority).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Powers and authority ==
The powers of the president vary widely across organizations. In some organizations the president has the authority to hire staff and make financial decisions, while in others the president only makes recommendations to a [[board of directors]], and still others the president has no executive powers and is mainly a [[Spokesperson|spokesman]] for the organization. The amount of power given to the president depends on the type of organization, its structure, and the rules it has created for itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disciplinary procedures ==
If the president exceeds the given authority, engages in misconduct, or fails to perform the duties, the president may face disciplinary procedures. Such procedures may include [[censure]], suspension, or [[Declare the chair vacant|removal from office]]. The rules of the particular organization would provide details on who can perform these disciplinary procedures and the extent that they can be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 20)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, whoever appointed or elected the president has the power to discipline this officer.

== President-Elect ==
{{See also|-elect}}Some organizations may have a position of President-Elect in addition to the position of President. Generally the membership of the organization elects a President-Elect and when the term of the President-Elect is complete, that person automatically becomes President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immediate Past President ==
Some organizations may have a position of Immediate Past President in addition to the position of President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is the Immediate Past President? - Association of Information Technology Professionals|url = https://www.aitp.org/news/123604/|website = www.aitp.org|access-date = 2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = President-Elect/President/Immediate Past President|url = http://www.asha.org/About/governance/BOD/President/|website = www.asha.org|access-date = 2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = President-elect, President or Immediate Past President Position Description|url = http://www.eatrightpro.org/resource/leadership/nominations-and-elections/national-leadership-positions/president-elect-or-president-position-description|website = www.eatrightpro.org|access-date = 2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those organizations, when the term of the President is complete, that person automatically fills the position of Immediate Past President. The organization can have such a position only if the bylaws provide it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 572}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duties of such a position would also have to be provided in the bylaws.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Process specification''' is a generic term for the specification of a process. Its context is not unique to "business activity" but can be applied to any organizational activity.  

Within some structured methods, the capitalized term '''Process Specification''' refers to a description of the [[Procedure (term)|procedure]] to be followed by an actor within an elementary level business activity, as represented on a process model such as a [[dataflow diagram]] or [[IDEF0]] model. A common alias is minispec short for miniature specification. 

==Use in systems development==

The process specification defines what must be done in order to transform inputs into outputs. It is a detailed set of instructions outlining a business procedure that each elementary level business activity is expected to carry out. Process specifications are commonly included as an integral component of a requirements document in systems development. 

==Techniques==

There are a variety of approaches that can be used to produce a process specification including
*[[decision tables]]
*structured English (favored technique of most systems analysts)
*pre/post conditions
*[[use cases]], basic course or events/alternate paths in [[use cases]]
*[[flowcharts]].
*[[Nassi–Shneiderman diagram]]
*[[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[Activity diagram]] 

No matter what approach is used, it must communicate to system development designers, implementers and support professionals, as well as be verifiable by the stakeholders/end users.

'''Salvador V. Vassallo''' (24 March 1942 – 21 January 2007) was the [[president (corporate title)|president]] and [[CEO]] of [[Industrias Vassallo|Vassallo Industries]], [[headquarters|headquartered]] in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]]. The company produces  [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] injection moulded and extruded goods, and markets them worldwide.

==Early years==
Vassallo (birth name: '''Salvador V. Vassallo Ruiz''' &lt;ref group=note&gt;{{Spanish name|'''Vassallo'''|'''Ruiz'''|plain=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;), grandparents migrated from [[Italy]] in the late 19th century and settled in the town of [[Yauco, Puerto Rico|Yauco]]. Vassallo, nicknamed "Chiry", and his brothers were born in [[Yauco, Puerto Rico|Yauco]] and raised in the city of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] where their father, Salvador Vassallo Sr., opened a [[hardware store]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelponce.com/Commerce-and-Business.html Profile], TravelPonce.com; accessed 2 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

After school hours, Vassallo and his brothers, Efraín, Víctor, Félix, and Marcos, would work in the family business. Salvador Vassallo Sr. founded Vassallo Industries, Inc., a company which initially made only windows and cement blocks.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;[http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/vol4n15/CBVassallo-en.shtml Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112225902/http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/vol4n15/CBVassallo-en.shtml|date=12 January 2007}}, PuertoRico-herald.org; accessed 2 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salvador joins family business==
After Vassallo graduated from college, he went to work in as a salesman for his father's business. Traveling throughout Puerto Rico taking orders from established customers, he made new contacts with potential customers. These skills would serve him well when Vassallo and his brothers inherited the business. In the 1950s, Vassallo's brother Efrain David, an engineer and the oldest of the Vassallo brothers, saw the potential in [[plastic]].&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt;

==Vassallo Industries Inc.==
As a consequence of Efrain's vision, in 1962 Vassallo Industries Inc. pioneered the manufacture and distribution of plastic pipe and fittings for sanitary and electrical applications.  In 1972, Salvador Vassallo Sr. died and the company was inherited by his sons.  Efrain David was President and Chief Executive Officer of Vassallo Industries Inc. from 1978-89. During those 11 years the firm had a net profit of over $25 million, as audited by Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells, 1978-89.&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt;

In 1989, Efrain David sold his interest in Vassallo Industries and all his patents to his brothers, and joined son Efrain David Jr., in the development of the Puerto Rican marble industry. Vassallo Industries, Inc., named Salvador as its president, and the company grew to become a global leader in the manufacture of PVC. Today, it has strong brand recognition in the [[United States]] and [[Latin-America]].&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt; In the 1980s Vassallo opened a distribution Center in [[Miami, Florida]], to speed up order fulfillment and cut costs.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Vassallo Molding Company and other ventures==
In 1989 Salvador bought out his brothers and became president and chairman, assuming the [[CEO]] post in 2002.  In the 1990s Vassallo founded Vassallo Molding Company for the manufacture of plastic furniture and household goods.  In 1997, [[Home Depot]] became a client in addition to [[Kmart]] and [[Wal-Mart]].&lt;ref name="VI"&gt;[http://www.pridco.gobierno.pr/english/media_center/art_view.php?art_id=486&amp;retp=4 Vasallo Industries buys plastics manufacturer Syroco Inc.]{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company added a research and development division to its growing empire, with emphasis on quality control.  The company now has over forty [[patent]]s for different PVC products.&lt;ref name="VII"&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-5423111/Vassallo-rolls-with-the-punches.html Vassallo rolls with the punches to grow.(Vassallo Industries Inc.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2000, Efrain Vassallo (the only Puerto Rican named National Small Businessman of the Year [in 1996], to date) rejoined his brother in Vassallo Industries Inc as a consultant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/vol4n15/CBVassallo-en.html ''Vassallo Expands Products, Wins Substantial Contracts.''] Lida Estela Ruano. Puerto Rico Herald. 13 April 2000. Accessed 3 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Vassallo Industries Inc. invested $15 million in the expansion of its facility in Ponce, in an effort to produce Polyvinyl Chloride pellets for distribution in the United States, [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name="VI"/&gt;

In 2004, Vassallo Industries Inc. acquired [[Syroco| Syroco Inc.]], a plastics manufacturer, adding manufacturing operations in [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Arkansas]].  Syroco is one of the most prominent manufacturers of plastic furniture and wall decor in the United States. By acquiring Syroco, Vassallo Industries Inc. added [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Sam's Club]], [[Lowe's]] and [[Walgreens]] to its clientele.&lt;ref name="VII"/&gt;

Among the many products manufactured by the company founded by Salvador Vassallo are the following: fittings, flexible conduit, flower pots, leaf rakes, step stones, water tanks, pipes, PVC cement, kayaks and water floats. The company produces plastic furniture under the brand Signature Series Line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vassallointernational.com/#home Vassallo International], vassallointernational.com; accessed 24 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Vassallo's son, Rafael Vassallo, was named the president of Vassallo Industries Inc. and executive vice president of Syroco Inc.  Salvador Vassallo continued to be the CEO of the company and president of the Export Council of [[Puerto Rico]]. His nephew, [[Jesse Vassallo|Jesse]], (Victor's son), a swimmer, has continued the family tradition by establishing "Vassallo Unlimited".&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3718/is_200507/ai_n14900657 Syroco invests in its future], findarticles.com; accessed 2 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 21 January 2007, Salvador Vassallo died in the Hospital San Cristóbal in Ponce from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. He was buried in Las Mercedes Cemetery, and was survived by his wife Olga and two children, Rafael and Viviana. 

The [[Mayor]] of Ponce, [[Francisco Zayas Seijo]], declared three days of mourning and ordered the flags at Ponce's City Hall to be flown at half mast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6206909/Vassallo-co-founder-Chiry-dies.html Obituary], goliath.ecnext.com; accessed 2 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, after nine years as a journalist,&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite news|title=Shoba Purushothaman|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=9709658&amp;privcapId=427601|accessdate=13 May 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; she joined Anthony Hayward at Bulletin International in London as a partner.

This transformed how the marketing industry delivered content to the media, which had previously been via satellite or tape dispatch.&lt;ref name="what newsmarket did"&gt;{{cite news|last=Heintz|first=Nadine|title=Honorable Mention: Shoba Purushothaman|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/20050101/eoty-purushothaman.html|accessdate=13 May 2014|newspaper=Inc.com|date=1 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, The NewsMarket provided video clips digitally to 3000 newsrooms. "There is quite a lot of media interest in content like that and it's not the kind of video a newsroom can easily get access to, but it's a major milestone in technology achievement," she told Digital Dealmakers.&lt;ref name="TV week" /&gt;

The Company established operations in London, Mumbai, Munich, Ahmedabad, Beijing and San Francisco while she was CEO. Investors include [[Apax Partners]], [[Battery Ventures]], Hearst Interactive Media, and [[Softbank Capital]].

An anti-communist activist during the 1965-1966 period in Indonesia, Sofjan has been active in business, government, and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Sofjan's brother, Jusuf Wanandi, has written a fast-moving account of the activities that Chinese-Catholic political activists -- including Sofjan -- were involved in during the period of the [[Suharto|Soeharto]] era in Indonesia.

'''Suphachai Chearavanont''' ({{lang-th|ศุภชัย เจียรวนนท์}}, {{RTGS|''Suphachai Chiarawanon''}}; {{lang-zh|謝榕仁}}; 24 March 1967) CEO of Charoen Pokphand (CP) Group and Chairman of the Executive Committee of [[True Corporation|True Corporation Plc]]. He is a member of the Thai Government’s Independent Committee for Educational Reform appointed by  Thai Prime Minister, General Prayut Chan-o-cha.   

Born on March 24, 1967, Suphachai is the fourth child of [[Dhanin Chearavanont]], Thailand's wealthiest billionaire, Senior Chairman of [[Charoen Pokphand|CP Group]], one of the world's largest agro-industrial conglomerates, and [[Chearavanont family|Khunying Tawee Chearavanont]]. Suphachai Chearavanont graduated from [[Boston University]], United States with a bachelor of business administration in financial management. He is married to Busadee Chearavanont and the couple has two sons and a daughter.

Under Suphachai's leadership, True Corporation grew 1,000% from sales of less than $300 million to over $3 billion within less than 10 years. Since founding the wireless carrier arm in 2003, True saw its subscribers increase from 0 to 24 million under Suphachai's leadership. It also saw subscribers for Pay TV, True Visions, increase from less than 200,000 households, to some 1.6 million households.

==Early career==
While in the US after graduating, Suphachai was an intern at a petrochemical factory in Houston Texas. On his return to Thailand he gained work experience at Siam Makro, a company in which CP Group was then a shareholder. He also gained financial experience by working with Soltext Federal Credit Union in the US and Vinylthai, one of Thailand’s leading petrochemical companies. He joined TelecomAsia Corporation, Thailand’s largest telecommunication company, in 1992 and worked his way up from a Senior Officer to senior management where his positions included chief operations and planning officer, executive vice-president for business, and senior vice-president for planning, project coordination and support.&lt;ref name = RightMan&gt;Supattha Sukchoo and Napaporn Chaikhankaew, May 3, 2012.  http://www.gotomanager.com/news/printnews.aspx?id=94068&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = TrueDream&gt;Pattanapan Wongpan and Disanee Nakcharoen., Suphachai Chearavanont: Dream Catcher CEO Making of True.{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}
 {{Dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also served as chief operations officer of UTV Cable Television and founded a number of subsidiaries for the [[True Corporation|TelecomAsia Group]], such as Asia Wireless Communication Company Limited, a PCT (Person Communication Telephone) operator; Asia Infonet Company Limited, which operates internet businesses; Asia Multimedia Company Limited, a broadband operator; and Wire and Wireless Company Limited, a construction and distribution business.

==Professional career==

===Starting the telecommunications business===

The years 1992 to 1996 were a boom era for the Thai telecommunications industry. The government had granted concessions to allow the private sector to invest in fixed-line, mobile and other new telecom services. Many private companies received both domestic and overseas loans to invest in the Thai telecom business. CP Group was one of the few privately owned Thai companies with the potential to operate such a business and it was invited to compete with foreign companies in a bid for concessions, which CP Group won.&lt;ref name="RightMan"/&gt;

Suphachai first worked in the company’s operations room and gradually gained knowledge about the fixed-line business where he worked as the senior officer for the president’s office. He was promoted until he was responsible for managing network rollout, being responsible for the overview of the business and for leading the installation of a network of 2.6 million fixed-line phones. The network was successfully installed within two years.&lt;ref name="TrueDream"/&gt;

As with most Thai companies, TelecomAsia was affected by the 1997 Asian financial crisis which saw the Thai Baht collapse from 25 Baht/USD to 55 Baht/USD. The company’s debt almost doubled to around 90 billion Baht and it was unable to repay its obligations within the due date and had to negotiate delayed repayment and enter a restructuring process.

Suphachai explained to creditors that the fixed-line business was still growing and that evolving technology would lead to the development of data services which TelecomAsia would be able to commercially exploit. The creditors approved TelecomAsia’s restructured debt-repayment program.

Once the economy had recovered from the Asian financial crisis, the company developed a diverse range of new marketing activities which helped improve its financial position and revenue base. In 1999 Suphachai was promoted to the position of President and CEO.

===Recovery and consolidation===

In 2003, Suphachai and then TelecomAsia invested heavily in building up the country's third national wireless carrier, over a decade behind competitors. TA Orange grew rapidly during its first years under heavy and innovative marketing campaign.

Suphachai and TA Orange soon ran into trouble when France Telecom acquired Orange (UK) and France Telecom refused to increase capital and funding into the TA Orange joint venture. TA Orange, thus, was unable to keep up with competitor investments and expand its network fast enough.

In 2005, TelecomAsia finally struck a deal to buyout France Telecom's stake in TA Orange for 1 Thai Baht. Upon the buyback of TA Orange, TelecomAsia transformed itself into "True Corporation". It rebranded under a fresh and modern logo. It consolidated into True Mobile, which evolved from TA Orange, and True Online, which evolved from TelecomAsia's internet broadband business. Suphachai soon also took a controlling stake in UBC, then the country's leading independent pay TV provider, and transformed it into True Visions.

Under Suphachai's leadership, TelecomAsia transformed from a fix line phone provider to Thailand's leading telecommunications conglomerate, being Thailand's largest internet service provider, cable/pay TV provider, and the country's third largest wireless carrier with some 24 million subscribers. Under his leadership, True Corporation grew 1,000% from sales of less than $300 million to over $3 billion within less than 10 years.

In June 2015 Suphachai was presented with the “2015 Frost &amp; Sullivan Asia Pacific Telecom CEO of the Year” award at The Asia Pacific ICT Awards in Singapore for his leadership and outstanding achievements in developing the telecommunications industry within the Asia Pacific region. He was selected as the award recipient by a panel of judges comprising top executives from leading telecommunications companies across the region as well as analysts from Frost &amp; Sullivan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frost &amp; Sullivan Award 2015|url=http://www3.truecorp.co.th/the_asia_pacific_ict_awards/index_en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, Suphachai was elected President of The Telecommunications Association of Thailand under The Royal Patronage.

[[File:Tony Granger.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''Tony Granger''' is the global chief creative officer of the New York-based global advertising agency [[Young &amp; Rubicam]].

==Career==
Tony Granger is Global Chief Creative Officer of [http://www.yr.com Young &amp; Rubicam] (a part of [http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-news/stocks/prices-search/stock-prices-search.html?nameCode=WPP WPP]) and architect of the company's global creative community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YR.com: Tony Granger|url=http://www.yr.com/about/people#grid=112|accessdate=7 January 2015|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=shots.com: Tony Granger|url=http://www.shots.net/news/article/82457/creative-monitor-tony-granger|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since arriving at Young &amp; Rubicam in 2008, Granger has attracted some of the industry’s best creative talent and fully integrated digital into the agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Association of Advertising Agencies|url=https://ams.aaaa.org/eWeb/content.aspx?WebCode=ViewStaff&amp;AgencyKey=1780e2c5-ca98-421e-bfb4-0b0dcd840327|accessdate=7 January 2015|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also built a global creative community in both spirit and practice. As a result, all of Y&amp;R's clients — anywhere in the world — get access to precisely the right creative talent they need to create the most appropriate and powerful work.

Creating a collaborative creative culture has resulted in great work and results for clients such as [[Land Rover]], [[Dell]], [[Wendy’s]], [[Gatorade]], and [[Vodafone]].

It’s also earned great industry recognition. At this past [[Cannes Lions]] in June 2015, Y&amp;R won 89 Lions across 15 categories, holding its rank as the fourth most winning agency network of the year for the fourth consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=businesswire.com: Cannes|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150701006552/en/YR-Achieves-Performance-2015-Cannes-Lions-Winning#.Vcj1n3FViko|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Y&amp;R had more offices winning Lions than any other network. In addition, Y&amp;R Team Red Istanbul won the Grand Prix in Media for its [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXxRZSHc2z4 Red Light App] to protect women from domestic abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=adweek.com: Y&amp;R|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/yr-wins-media-grand-prix-app-lets-women-call-help-shaking-their-phones-165538|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=fortune.com: Red Light App|url=http://fortune.com/2015/07/14/domestic-violence-app-turkey/|ref=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before joining Y&amp;R, Granger spent five years at [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]], where he took Saatchi New York to the number one agency at Cannes.&lt;ref name="Cannes Lions Award Winners"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cannes Lions Award Winners|url=http://www.adforum.com/award/showcase/6650183/2007|publisher=Adforum|accessdate=7 January 2015|ref=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, too, he led the agency’s creative transformation. He led a similar renaissance at [[Bozell]] New York, where he took the agency to number three in the world. Granger began his career in his native South Africa, where he led [[TBWA/Hunt Lascaris]], a shop of proud heritage and creative pedigree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paoletta|first1=Michael|title=The Billboard Q&amp;A Tony Granger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0A0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=tony+granger+bozell+billion+dollar+revenue&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QD3vE769Dj&amp;sig=9--tXb6-gUNwbFvfA6HWBqt_cWc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oBffS-zkIoK78gbAtLmjBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tony%20granger%20bozell%20billion%20dollar%20revenue&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 January 2015|ref=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Granger and his agencies have won many awards, and he’s been fortunate to serve as president of several international juries, most recently serving as the Outdoor Jury President at Cannes in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=adage.com: Cannes Jury|url=http://adage.com/article/global-news/cannes-lions-announces-16-jury-presidents/239786/|ref=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he’s most proud to have shaped top creative agencies, and worked with the world’s most sought-after clients on some of the most recognized and influential global brands. He is excited about the future of the business and this industry.

In a series of emails quoted in Business Insider in 2013, Mark Mackay, Executive Chairman of Australian agency The Campaign Palace, described Granger as “an arrogant leader in New York”, as well as lacking “commercial savvy” and as a “bully”. He said, "One needs to humour bullies and the way that one does it is as I have outlined in these emails."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/brutal-emails-reveal-yr-boss-regarded-his-creative-director-as-arrogant-and-a-bully-2013-5?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=Brutal Emails Reveal Y&amp;amp;R Boss Regarded His Creative Director As 'Arrogant' And A 'Bully'|last=Edwards|first=Jim|date=2013-05-11|work=Business Insider Australia|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Fishlock, then Executive Creative Director of Campaign Palace, later dismissed, brought a case against the agency and won. In a long article, Australian trade publication Mumbrella reports of the case that "Fishlock is entirely vindicated in his claims that he was unfairly axed as national creative chief of the now defunct Campaign Palace," and that "The reputation of Young &amp; Rubicam’s global creative director Tony Granger certainly takes a battering in my view. The word “bully” is a hard one to come back from."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mumbrella.com.au/the-vindication-of-paul-fishlock-155006|title=The vindication of Paul Fishlock - Mumbrella|date=2013-05-10|work=Mumbrella|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century''' is a [[United States federal law]], signed on April 5, 2000, seeking to improve [[airline]] safety.  It is popularly called '''"AIR 21,"''' and is also known as Public Law 106-181.

==Background==

On 11 September 1991, [[Continental Express Flight 2574]], an '''Embraer''' EMB 120 Brasilia carrying 14 people, crashed as it was approaching [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport|Intercontinental Airport]] in [[Houston, Texas]], killing all 14 people on board.

The [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) investigation revealed that screws had been removed from the horizontal stabilizer during maintenance the night before the accident and, following a shift change, the screws were not replaced.

NTSB cited the failure of airline maintenance and inspection personnel to adhere to proper maintenance and quality assurance procedures. The failure of [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) surveillance to detect and verify compliance with approved procedures was cited as a contributing factor.

Some months after, the same airline had a similar incident when a plane was forced to return to the airport after bolts had been removed from a wing panel. NTSB decried that even a fatal accident and an FAA NASIP inspection weren't enough to overcome what appears to have been corporate culture.

According to Meshkati (1997), the crash of [[Continental Express]] Flight 2574 was the most dramatic turning point for "[[safety culture]]" in the United States.[http://www.aviation.uiuc.edu/UnitsHFD/TechPdf/02-3.pdf] As a member of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) at that time, Dr. John Lauber suggested that the probable cause of this accident included "The failure of Continental Express management to establish a corporate culture which encouraged and enforced adherence to approved maintenance and quality assurance procedures" (NTSB/AAR-92/04, 1992, pg. 54, as cited in Meshkati, 1997). As a result of this and other similar aviation accidents, safety culture came to the forefront as the exclusive topic at the U.S. National Summit on Transportation Safety, hosted by the NTSB in 1997.

==Enactment==
AIR 21 was known as H.R. 1000 in 106th Congress, second session. [[Bud Shuster|Rep. Bud Shuster]] (R-Pa.) introduced it on 4 March 1999.  It was enacted on 5 April 2000.  Upon signing the bill into law, [[U.S. President|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This bill contains many new provisions to advance aviation safety. Of particular note is the inclusion of the "Aircraft Safety Act of 1999," which my Administration proposed to help stop the indefensible practice of manufacturing, distributing, and installing fraudulently represented, nonconforming aircraft parts. Several significant provisions to provide "whistleblower" protections to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and air industry employees, to close a potential loophole in the prosecution of hazardous materials cases, and to combat "air rage" incidents in flight, will also address real safety concerns we face today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=58334 Statement on Signing the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Safety provisions==
AIR 21 set requirements for safety equipment for specific aircraft, added consumer and employee protection provisions, and imposed new requirements for commercial air tour operations over national parks.

Title V established civil penalties for individuals who interfere with or jeopardize the safety of a cabin crew or other passengers. This provision seeks to deter "air rage."

Section 507 modified the sanction for transporting hazardous materials by removing the requirement that the person have knowledge of the regulation related to the transportation of hazardous materials.  However, it permits consideration of lack of knowledge in mitigation of the penalty.  This requirement is at 49 U.S.C. 46312.

Section 401 of the bill prohibited a state or local government from preventing people associated with disaster counseling services who are not licensed in that state from providing those services for up to 60 days after an aviation accident. Section 402 of the bill would expand a current preemption of state liability laws by limiting the liability of air carriers that provide information concerning flight reservations to the families of passengers involved in airline accidents. Air carriers are already provided immunity from state liability laws for providing passenger lists under these circumstances. Because neither mandate would require state or local governments to expend funds or to change their laws, CBO estimates that any costs associated with these mandates would be insignificant.

In Section 725, the act required the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] to contract with the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] for an independent study of the air quality in passenger cabins.

==Consumer protections==
Title II sought to improve consumer access in all regions of the United States, including those in small communities and rural and remote areas, to affordable, regularly scheduled air service.

Section 221 made it an unfair or deceptive practice for any air carrier, or ticket agent utilizing electronically transmitted tickets for air transportation to fail to notify the purchaser of such a ticket of its expiration date.  It did so by amending 49 U.S.C. 41712(b).

Section 224 required airlines to file individual customer service plans with the Secretary of Transportation.

Title IV made the [[Death on the High Seas Act]] (DOHSA) inapplicable to aviation incidents, thereby broadening the circumstances under which relatives can seek compensation for the death of a family member in an aviation incident over the ocean.

AIR 21 also includes a legislative advance for air travelers with disabilities.

==Financial provisions==
The [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimated that AIR 21 would result in additional outlays totaling about $56&amp;nbsp;billion over the 2000-2004 period.[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/1?&amp;sid=cp106G5jeT&amp;hd_count=2&amp;xform_type=3&amp;refer=&amp;r_n=hr167p2.106&amp;db_id=106&amp;item=1&amp;sel=TOC_0&amp;]

Title I authorized the appropriation of $47.6&amp;nbsp;billion for FAA operations, facilities, and equipment for fiscal years 2000 through 2004. Title I also provided $19.2&amp;nbsp;billion in contract authority for the FAA's airport improvement program for fiscal years 2000 through 2004.  It provided an additional $7.1&amp;nbsp;billion in contract authority for the airport improvement program (AIP) over the 2000-2004 period (above the $2.4&amp;nbsp;billion a year assumed in the baseline).  It allowed airports to charge higher passenger facility fees.

AIR 21 took the [[Airport and Airway Trust Fund]] (AATF) off-budget and exempted AATF spending from the discretionary spending caps, pay-as-you-go procedures, and Congressional budget controls.[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/1?&amp;sid=cp106G5jeT&amp;hd_count=2&amp;xform_type=3&amp;refer=&amp;r_n=hr167p2.106&amp;db_id=106&amp;item=1&amp;sel=TOC_0&amp;]
This provision was a goal of the [[AOPA#The Nineties to Present|Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association]] which sought to unlock the aviation trust fund.

Title VII extended the war risk insurance program and prohibited the FAA from charging fees for certain services. This title provided that, of the amounts appropriated for FAA operations in fiscal year 2000, $2&amp;nbsp;million may be used to eliminate a backlog of [[Equal Opportunity Employment|equal employment opportunity]] complaints at the Department of Transportation (DOT).

==Employee protections==
Title VI provided [[whistleblower]] protection for employees of air carriers who notify authorities that their employer is violating a federal law relating to air carrier safety. The bill set up a complaint and investigation process within the Department of Labor (DOL).  The time limit for employees to make such complaints in writing to the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] is 90 days from the date of each adverse employment action.[http://www.workplacefairness.org/air21]

==Public Availability of Airmen Records==
Section 715, "Public Availability of Airmen Records", allows the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] to release the names, addresses, and ratings held by nearly all pilots with a medical certificate. This includes the release of information to private businesses, including those not necessarily having any relation to aviation safety (the intent of the bill). The FAA must notify airmen of this clause via mail and notify them that they have 90 days to opt out of the inclusion of their personal information into the public record. If no action is taken within 90 days, then an opt-in is assumed.&lt;ref&gt;Airmen Certification: Public Availability of Airmen Records (Federal Aviation Administration) [http://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/airmen_certification/hr1000/]&lt;/ref&gt;
